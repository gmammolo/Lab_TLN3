  "text": "Local Clergy Offer Community Message Of Healing Following Flood\nTRIADELPHIA – Nine local clergy representing a variety of faiths provided a united message of healing during an interfaith service Wednesday in honor of those affected by tragic flooding in Ohio County last month.\nThe service took place outside on Liberty Distributors’ property in Triadelphia. The business was among the many devastated by the flash flooding that devastated Valley Grove and Triadelphia, as well as parts of Elm Grove and Woodsdale.\nRabbi Joshua Lief of the Temple Shalom commended those who have stepped forward to assist during the flood aftermath, and he offered stern words for those who have not.\n“To those who have not helped, to those who have delayed the act of helping – I say it is immoral to stand idly by while your neighbor bleeds …,” he said.\n“To those who are still suffering, I say you are not alone. For all of us together are one community bound together as partners with God. Responsible for each other, we will continue to stand together. ”\nPastor Michael Palmer of the Triadelphia United Methodist Church spoke a prayer for the nine people who lost their lives in the flooding, and those who continue to mourn.\n“I speak only their first names, because Heavenly Father you are their last,” Palmer said. He asked the Lord to uphold their families and friends in comfort.\nThe Rev. Kenneth Hardway of the First Christian Church prayed for those who lost homes, possessions and livelihood during the flood.\n“The grief is natural and healthy, but it will not define us,” he explained. “We can lift up our heads today knowing the value of life, feeling the solidarity of community and experiencing the hope of a new day.”\nThe Rev. Adam Mick of Christ Community Church spoke for the spiritual health of first responders and emergency personnel.\n“May they know that their sacrificial service reflects love for this community,” he said. “God grant them rest – rest that so many have yet to take. (Give them) rest for their weariness, and a killing for any pain either seen or unseen.”\nThe efforts of neighbors, volunteers, and relief workers were addressed by The Most Rev. Mark Brennan, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston.\n“Those who have survived the flood waters, and those who are helping them, need to have the confidence that with the strength of God working through them, they can accomplish much good to help people rebuild their lives, their homes, their businesses,” Brennan said.\nBishop Darrell Cummings of the Bethlehem Apostolic Temple spoke of despair in the wake of the flood.\n“As bad as it was – and it was horrible and sad and I wish it wouldn’t have happened – I just want to remind us that it could have been worse,” he said. “All we have to do is ask the people in Texas.\n“Where we have lost nine people, that is devastating. They have lost hundreds, and they are still looking for 190 people.”\nThe Ven. Joshua Saxe of St. Matthews Episcopal Church offered prayer for the restoration of the community, its infrastructure and beauty.\n“The breath of God redeems and repairs what is broken,” he said. “We don’t do this alone. It is God working through us, and through the hands of those serving our neighbors in need that will see our community raised back up. Let us continue to lean on God, and continue to lean on each other in the coming days and months ahead.”\nThe Rev. Joe Hill, the new pastor at Christ United Methodist Church, offered a prayer for government officials to remain focused on fair and just treatment for all who seek assistance.\n“We are grateful for our leaders who understand that the office they hold is not a privilege. They are not so much put in charge of others, but the well being of others is entrusted to their care,” he said. “In their promotion of such ways, we are grateful.”",
