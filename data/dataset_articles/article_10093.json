  "text": "WorldPosted at: Jun 19 2025 8:30AM Qantas plane damaged in jet bridge collision at Brisbane airport in AustraliaSydney, June 19 (UNI) A plane of Australian airline Qantas has been damaged after colliding with a jet bridge at the Brisbane International Airport on Wednesday night. Flight QF186 struck a passenger jet bridge after landing in Brisbane from Queenstown in New Zealand shortly before 6:40 p.m. local time on Wednesday, local media Brisbane Times reported on Thursday morning. Images published by the newspaper on Thursday show that the windscreen of the Boeing 737-800 was shattered in the incident. No injuries were reported and passengers disembarked the plane via the stairs. A spokesperson for Qantas said that the airline was investigating how the bridge made contact with the front of the aircraft. \"The aircraft will be inspected by engineers in Brisbane and repaired before returning to service,\" he said. It is the second jet bridge strike at the Brisbane airport in under a month after Air New Zealand Flight NZ146 made contact with a bridge as it was pushing back from a gate on May 22 and sustained a puncture in the fuselage, causing the scheduled flight to Auckland to be canceled.
