  "text": "The midpoint of June has passed in the calendar and the Dolphins still have CB Jalen Ramsey on the roster, despite signaling their clear intentions to trade him.\nRams HC Sean McVay , speaking at the team’s mandatory minicamp in Hawaii, said Los Angeles still has an interest in reuniting with Ramsey after trading him to Miami a couple of seasons ago. However, he pointed out there are some challenges to sort through.\n“Usually, those are scenarios and situations that you have to have plans in place prior to executing some of the decisions that have occurred,” McVay said via NFL Media’s Kevin Patra . “Definitely don’t want to rule anything out because we’re always open-minded to onboarding and acquiring quality players and people like him if we’re able to do that, but there would be some obstacles that are real that are in the place of maybe preventing that from occurring.”\nMcVay elaborated a little more on what those obstacles consist of, per USA Today’s Cameron DaSilva .\n“What is his salary? And are we able to take that on just based on our current situation when you onboard a player that’s earned the right to be paid where he’s at? Those are things that you’re usually planning months in advance and obviously, it was unforeseen that he would become available. And if you do execute a trade, what are they looking for in return? Is there a conversation to be had in terms of a portion of that contract that they pay? Are they interested in players or draft capital? So there’s a lot of layers to that.”\nWhat it all seems to build down to, per McVay, is the Rams being hesitant about picking up the full tab on Ramsey’s salary for this year, which is over $20 million in guarantees. That’s a steep bill in addition to giving up a draft pick, and the Rams have been mindful of their spending with a battalion of young players due for big-money contract extensions over the next few years.\nThe Dolphins are still expected to trade Ramsey in the coming weeks but there is a lot to sort through with interested teams regarding how much of Ramsey’s salary they’ll pick up. The Rams remain a team to watch .\nRamsey, 30, is a former first-round pick of the Jaguars back in 2016. He signed a four-year, $23.35 million contract and was set to make a base salary of $3.63 million in 2019.\nThe Jaguars picked up Ramsey’s fifth-year option that cost them around $13 million for the 2020 season before trading him to the Rams for two first-round picks and a fourth-round selection.\nHe signed a five-year, $105 million extension before the start of the 2020 season, before he was traded to the Dolphins, later signing a three-year, $72.3 million deal with the team in 2024.\nIn 2024, Ramsey appeared in and started all 17 games for the Dolphins and recorded 60 tackles, two interceptions, one sack, and defended 11 passes.\nWe will have more on Ramsey as the news becomes available.",
