  "text": "After a spring semester “unlike anything ever seen in higher education,” Cornell University will likely begin layoffs as it seeks reductions in personnel, operations, research and other expenditures, the university announced in a statement on Wednesday.\nIn its statement, university leaders said that federal funding freezes, coupled with an unsustainable increase in university costs and expenses, have led to “significant financial shortfalls.” To combat these challenges, leadership said the university will review and cut costs, along with making permanent changes to its operational model.\nThe university referenced several funding challenges it has faced in recent months, including over $1 billion in federal funds frozen by the Trump administration, threats to future research funding and federal financial aid, “rapidly escalating” legal expenses and an anticipated increased tax on endowment.\n“Cornell’s funding model, developed over 160 years, is strong and diversified, and has carried us successfully through many past crises,” Cornell leadership wrote in the statement. “We are now experiencing simultaneous attacks or threats on every element of that model.”\nBeyond threats to its revenue, the university said it is experiencing a “marked and unsustainable increase in expenses” due to inflation, a 15% growth in staff over the past four years, and other cost pressures.\nIn the short-term, the university has been utilizing “institutional resources” to bridge its funding gaps but said these measures are unsustainable.\nIn the statement, signed by President Michael I. Kotlikoff, Provost Kavita Bala, Provost for Medical Affairs Robert A. Harrington, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Cowen, university leaders said that they will take several actions to reduce Cornell’s workforce.\nCornell University is the largest employer in Tompkins County, with a workforce of over 11,000, according to the Tompkins County Chamber of Commerce. It is unclear how many positions the reductions will affect.\nThe university announced that it would conduct a comprehensive review of programs and staff, engaging personnel from every department for streamlined processes and efficiencies.\n“These efforts will reduce Cornell’s workforce — a necessity to ensure Cornell’s long-term financial viability,” the university statement said. “While we will make every effort to downsize by attrition, we anticipate involuntary reductions in headcount across the university.”\nIn February, the university announced a four-month university-wide hiring freeze, referencing the proposed endowment tax and research funding cuts. The hiring freeze, along with restrictions on discretionary expenses like food and travel, has been extended to remain effective throughout the 2025-26 academic year, according to the statement.\nThe university added that it will unify information systems across campuses and “deploy technology where appropriate” to consolidate operations.\nRelated reporting:\nThe Trump administration has put over $1 billion in funding on hold for Cornell as the university faces a federal investigation from the Depar…\nCornell University has instituted a four-month hiring freeze during a time of “significant financial uncertainty,” citing potential cuts to re…\nITHACA, NY — Cornell University and 11 other research institutions have joined a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s directive to s…",
