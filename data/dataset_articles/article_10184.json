  "text": "A sudden shortage of textbooks prescribed by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) has been reported in several parts of Goa, following an unexpected rise in demand from private schools.\nThe shortage primarily affects textbooks for Classes I to IV, which have traditionally been supplied only to government and aided schools. Last week, shops reported a shortage of higher secondary text books for Classes IX to XII.\nIn recent times, several private schools across Goa have begun adopting the SCERT textbooks, leading to increased pressure on the existing supply system. While SCERT has ensured the distribution of textbooks to government and aided institutions as per the usual procedure, the body does not directly supply books to private schools. Instead, these institutions are expected to source them from the open market through local book sellers.\nA book seller from Margao, who requested anonymity, said, “The demand from private schools has gone up significantly this academic year, but there’s not enough stock available to meet the requirement.” According to him, many stores are currently out of stock, leaving parents and schools scrambling to find the necessary textbooks.\nReacting to the issue, SCERT Chairperson Meghana Shetgaonkar confirmed that the council has been receiving increasing requests from book sellers regarding the shortage.\n“We have completed the distribution to government and aided schools as per the schedule. However, we are now seeing demand from private schools. Since SCERT does not supply directly to them, the books must be purchased from the market,” Shetgaonkar said.\nShe also clarified that SCERT is prepared to address the shortfall. “We have asked sellers and private schools to communicate their requirements. Once we receive those, we are ready to print additional copies to fulfill the demand,” she added.\nThe shift by private schools towards using SCERT textbooks is seen by some educators as a move to align with state-approved curriculum and to reduce the cost burden on parents, as SCERT books are more affordable than those from private publishers.",
