Previous demands by the body for an end to the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas have been ignored. Unlike the U.N. Security Council, no country has a veto in the General Assembly.\nReuters\nIsrael Gaza War Updates\nIsrael-Gaza War Updates\nUN\nVote\nGaza\nCeasefire\nIsrael\nUS\nVeto\nNext\nGaza Humanitarian Foundation says Hamas attacked a bus of its workers, 5 dead\nIsrael urges Egypt to block Gaza-bound activist convoy\nPrevious\nSubscribe to our VOD\nSUBSCRIBE\nDownload now the LBCI mobile app\nTo see the latest news, the latest daily programs in Lebanon and the world\nGoogle Play\nApp Store\nWe use\ncookies\nWe use\ncookies\nto make\nyour experience on this\nwebsite better.\nAccept\nLearn More",
