  "text": "The Israeli military has found the remains of two more hostages held in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.\nOne of the hostages, Yair Yaakov, was killed on October 7, 2023, during a Hamas attack on southern Israel and his body was subsequently taken to Gaza.\nThe identity of the second hostage, whose body was found, is not yet known.\nMeanwhile, the Health Ministry in Gaza, which is under the political control of Hamas, said the number of Palestinian casualties in the 20-month war between Israel and Hamas had exceeded 55.000.\nThe ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants killed, but said women and children account for more than half of the dead.\nThe war began with an attack by the Palestinian militant Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and shows no signs of abating.\nHamas launched the attack from Gaza, kidnapping more than 200 people and killing about 1.200. Israel then launched an attack on Gaza with the stated goal of destroying Hamas.\nIsrael claims that it is only attacking armed fighters and blames Hamas for the deaths of civilians, as its members allegedly hide among civilians because they operate in populated areas.\nBonus video:",
