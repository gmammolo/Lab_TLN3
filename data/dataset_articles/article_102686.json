  "text": "NYT: Iran devises missile counterstrike plan in response to possible Israeli attack 12 June 2025 10:36 (UTC +04:00) \"The official said that Tehran had devised a response plan that would involve an immediate counterstrike on Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles,\" The New York Times wrote, citing sources, APA reports.\n\"Iranian military and government officials have already met to discuss their response to a potential Israeli strike, according to a senior Iranian official,\" the report said.\nNote that earlier, CBS reported that U.S. officials received information indicating that Israel appears to be preparing to launch an attack soon on Iran.\nAccording to Axios, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a phone call on June 9 not to take such a step.\nIran’s defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, raised alarms on Wednesday with a warning that, in the event of a conflict following failed nuclear talks, the United States would suffer heavy losses. “America will have to leave the region because all its military bases are within our reach and we will, without any consideration, target them in the host countries,” he told reporters.",
