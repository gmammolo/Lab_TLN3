  "text": "U.S. embassies on alert amid rising tensions as Israel threatens strike on Iran 12 June 2025 10:49 (UTC +04:00) In anticipation of potential fallout, Washington has ordered US embassies located within Iran's strike range -- including those in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and North Africa -- to activate emergency action committees, APA reports citing the Washington Post.\nThese missions have been instructed to report back on security measures to mitigate potential risks. The State Department has reportedly also authorised voluntary departures from missions in Bahrain and Kuwait.\nThis precautionary approach led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to update the global travel advisory on Wednesday, stating, \"On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions.\"\nNote that earlier, CBS reported that U.S. officials received information indicating that Israel appears to be preparing to launch an attack soon on Iran.\nAccording to Axios, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a phone call on June 9 not to take such a step.\nIran’s defense minister, Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh, raised alarms on Wednesday with a warning that, in the event of a conflict following failed nuclear talks, the United States would suffer heavy losses. “America will have to leave the region because all its military bases are within our reach and we will, without any consideration, target them in the host countries,” he told reporters.\nElon Musk asks 'Is it time to create new political party?'
