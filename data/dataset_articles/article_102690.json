  "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia plans to seize Odessa and then reach the borders of Moldova and Romania, stressing the importance of supporting a European Moldova, Channel 24 reports.\nZelensky, who is hosting a summit in Odessa, emphasizes that if a European Moldova wins this year, it will encourage Russia to interfere even more in the affairs of the countries of Southeast Europe.\n\"Support for a European Moldova, and not pro-Russian or oligarchic forces, is an extremely important task for all of us,\" Zelensky stated.\nThe president added that Russia's plans include capturing Odessa. All this to reach the borders of Moldova and Romania.\n\"We are here in Odessa, a city that Russia wants to destroy, as it has destroyed countless other cities. Russian military plans are aimed at this region, and then at the borders of Moldova and Romania. We need protection now. But even more, we need long-term guarantees that this will never happen again,\" the Ukrainian leader said.\nAt the same time, Moldovan President Maia Sadu stressed that Russia will not stop even in her country if it is not stopped in Ukraine.\n\"Russia is abusing Ukrainian soil and attacking with hybrid weapons: lies, manipulation, blackmail, interfering in the political system, distorting democracy and trying to push partners away from Ukraine. Russia will not stop even in Moldova if it is not stopped in Ukraine. We need to help faster, more decisively, if Ukraine does not get what it needs, it will be too late,\" Sandu said.\nShe also added that it is necessary to support the \"center for preventing hybrid threats\" in Odessa. In addition, Sandu highlighted \"the need to stop illicit money flows, strengthen energy cooperation and jointly build cybersecurity\".\nVolodymyr Zelensky: Putin wants Odessa and then reach the borders of Moldova and Romania\nAt the same time, Moldovan President Maia Sadu emphasizes that Russia will not stop even in her country if I am not stopped in Ukraine\nJun 12, 2025 09:16 18",
