  "text": "Teton County, Idaho, commissioners remain divided over Grand Targhee Resort’s proposed expansion into the Caribou-Targhee National Forest as the public comment deadline on the project’s draft environmental impact statement looms.\nOn Wednesday, the three-member Board of County Commissioners postponed a decision on a draft comment letter until Monday to allow for further edits. The county, as a designated “cooperating agency,” has until June 20 to submit official comments, which the U.S. Forest Service has said carry more weight than those from the general public. More than 300 people attended a Forest Service open house in April to share their thoughts on the proposed expansion.",
