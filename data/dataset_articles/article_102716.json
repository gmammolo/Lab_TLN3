  "text": "Israeli Military Recovers Bodies of Two Hostages Killed on October 7\nIsraeli forces recovered on Wednesday the bodies of two hostages killed during the October 7 attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz, the military said in a statement. One of the victims was identified as Yair Yaakov, a 59-year-old father of three from the kibbutz. The name of the second individual has not yet been released publicly.\nYaakov was abducted alongside his partner, Meirav Tal, and two of his children during the Hamas-led attack. His body was located following interrogations of Gazan detainees and later identified at Israel’s National Institute of Forensic Medicine.\nThis holiday season, give to:\nTruth and understanding\nThe Media Line's intrepid correspondents are in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Pakistan providing first-person reporting.\nThey all said they cover it.\nWe see it.\nWe report with just one agenda: the truth.\nDonate\nHis 14-year-old son Yagil, who was freed in a November 2023 hostage deal, posted on Instagram thanking Israeli forces for the operation. “I hope we get the rest in a deal that won’t put soldiers at risk,” he added.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences to the family. “We will neither rest nor be silent until we return home all of our hostages—the living and the deceased,” he said in a statement.\nNir Oz was among the hardest-hit communities during the October 7 attacks, with around one-quarter of the population killed or abducted. Of the dozens of hostages still held in Gaza, nine are from Nir Oz.\nIsraeli officials are reportedly reviewing a response to a US-backed ceasefire and hostage release proposal. The offer includes a 60-day truce and partial Israeli withdrawal in exchange for 28 hostages. Hamas seeks guarantees that would make resuming combat harder if no permanent deal is reached.",
