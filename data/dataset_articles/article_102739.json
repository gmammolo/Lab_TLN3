  "text": "Trump says progress between Ukraine and Russia is 'over'\nUS President Donald Trump has stopped radiating optimism about the Russian-Ukrainian negotiations. Answering a journalist's question about what trump cards Washington has in terms of forcing the parties to peace, the owner of the White House said that progress between Moscow and Kiev has come to an end.\nThe American leader stressed that the US had previously managed to achieve certain results in achieving a diplomatic settlement. However, now everything has changed.\nThey are bombing things they shouldn't have.\n- declared Trump.\nApparently, this refers to the exchange of blows that have been taking place between the conflicting parties in recent weeks. Meanwhile, it is not entirely clear what the US president meant by the expression “should not have.”\nThis is probably a reproach to the head of the Kyiv regime Zelensky and his operation \"Web\", during which our airfields were attacked from a strategic aviationWashington claims that it knew nothing about Kyiv's intentions and accused the Ukrainian leadership of inciting a third world war.\nAt the same time, Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the Russian side. As he put it, our country is losing a lot of soldiers, as is Ukraine, but at the same time he gets the impression that Russian President Vladimir Putin “doesn’t care.”\nWe'll see what happens next.\n- the owner of the White House summed up.\nLet us recall that the US administration has recently been increasingly declaring a possible withdrawal from the negotiation process on Ukraine in the event of a lack of progress.",
