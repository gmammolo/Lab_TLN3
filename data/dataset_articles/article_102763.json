  "text": "The words “F*** Gaza” were spray-painted on the exterior wall of the Canadian Institute of Islamic Civilization, operated by the Muslim Association of Canada (MAC), in downtown Montreal.\nCanada’s Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, Amira Elghawaby, responded to the act on Wednesday, describing it as part of a broader trend of hate-motivated incidents.\n\"Vandalism fueled by hate targeting community centres, public spaces and places of worship sends a frightening message that threatens our collective safety and well-being,\" Elghawaby stated in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\nShe added that the incident in Montreal illustrates “the intersection of anti-Palestinian racism and Islamophobia,” and “reminds us why it has been critical to name APR (Anti-Palestinian Racism) and combat it.”\n\"And how all Canadians of conscience can stand together in solidarity—because our rights and freedoms are at stake,\" she said, emphasizing that “the ongoing stigmatization of Canadian Muslims and Palestinians must stop.”\nRead More:\nThe National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) also expressed concern about the incident and linked it to a broader rise in anti-Palestinian hostility.\n\"Needless to say, it is deeply disheartening and disappointing to witness yet another Muslim centre be attacked,\" the organization said in a statement posted on X. \"It is time for real change.\"\nNCCM reported a recent spike in anti-Palestinian racism cases across Canada, and has called on government leaders to take concrete steps to address the issue.\nRead More:\nLocal authorities have not yet released details about the investigation into the vandalism. No suspects have been identified at this time of publishing this report.\nThe MAC centre in Montreal is a prominent hub for religious, educational, and community programming, serving a diverse population in the downtown area.\nSource: Agencies",
