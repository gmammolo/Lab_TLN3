  "text": "Bolivia, battling an economic crisis that has plunged it into social unrest, risks defaulting on its loan payments if it does not obtain new foreign financing, President Luis Arce told AFP on Wednesday.\n\"We are trying not to default. We have every intention of paying our debt, but if we don't have the resources?\" the embattled leader said in an interview in his office in La Paz.\nBolivia's external debt stands at $13.3 billion.\nIts main creditors are the Inter-American Development Bank, the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF), the World Bank, and China.\nArce has been unable to convince parliament to allow him to seek new loans to the tune of $1.8 billion from multilateral agencies.\nThe country needs $2.6 billion by December for fuel imports and external debt payments.\n\"We are making the worst deal as a country. Because when one has external debt, you pay the principal and interest to the creditor, and that outflow of dollars is compensated by the inflow of new disbursements from new debts, which is not happening,\" said the president.\nBolivia's debt represents over 37 percent of its gross national income, according to the World Bank. The last time the country defaulted was in 1984.\nArce has dismissed calls to stand down over an economic crisis marked by a dire shortage of foreign currency, fuel and other basics.\nBut he has said he will not seek reelection in August, with his approval rating at 9.0 percent -- one of the lowest in South America, according to survey body Latinobarometro.\n- 'All his artillery' - More from this section 'Second time I've died': Nobel laureate Jelinek denies death reports",
