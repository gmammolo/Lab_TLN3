  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nRussia’s Troop Losses in Ukraine Now Hit 1 Million, General Staff Says\nRussia’s total military losses in Ukraine have surpassed 1,000,000 personnel, including those killed, wounded, or incapacitated, according to a June 12 report by Ukraine’s General Staff.\nOn June 11 alone, Russian forces sustained an additional 1,140 casualties, the General Staff added, along with dozens of units of military equipment destroyed.\n“The overall losses of the Russian occupying forces in manpower since the beginning of the full-scale invasion have reached one million,” the General Staff stated. “More than 628,000 occurred in just the past year and a half.”\nBreakdown of Russian casualties by year:\n2022: 106,720 troops lost — averaging 340 per day\n2023: 253,290 troops — averaging 693 per day\n2024: 430,790 troops — averaging 1,177 per day\n2025 (as of June 4): Over 200,000 troops — averaging 1,286 per day\nUkraine first began publicly tracking and publishing Russian losses on March 1, 2022, when the count stood at 5,710 killed and 200 captured. The next day, losses rose to 5,840, and by March 3, the figure was revised upward to 9,000 after verification.\nSome of the heaviest days of Russian losses occurred on:\nNovember 28, 2024: 2,030 casualties in a single day\nDecember 19, 2024: 2,200 casualties\nDecember 29, 2024: 2,010 casualties\nThe Ukrainian military emphasized that the one-million mark is not just a statistic but a symbol of resistance and resilience.\n“One million. That’s how much the enemy’s offensive potential has diminished,” the General Staff wrote. “One million who could have destroyed us, but whom we destroyed instead.”\nThe statement went on to highlight the symbolic meaning behind this figure, referencing sites of mass Russian losses and Ukrainian suffering—from the Red Forest near Chornobyl and the Dnipro River near the Antonivsky Bridge, to the hills of Donbas, the fields of Kharkiv region, and the depths of the Black Sea, where the cruiser Moskva lies.\n“This is our answer for Bucha, Irpin, Kupiansk, Kherson,” the statement continued. “For the maternity hospital in Mariupol, for the Ohmatdyt children’s hospital destroyed in Kyiv. For the tears of our children, the civilians shot dead, the homes turned to rubble.”\nUkraine also expressed gratitude to every soldier, sailor, sergeant, officer, and general who contributed to the fight, reaffirming that “every eliminated occupier is another step toward a just peace.”\n“Today, we’ve taken more than a million such steps,” the General Staff Concluded.\nEarlier, NATO officials on April 3 confirmed that Russia suffered over 250,000 military deaths since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with total losses—killed, wounded, or incapacitated— surpassing 900,000.",
