  "text": "Russian Army Launches 63 “Shaheds” at Night: How the Air Defense Worked\nOn the night of June 12, the Russian army launched a massive attack on Ukraine, using 63 Shahed-type attack drones and various types of drone imitators.\nThe Ukrainian Air Force reported this.\nUkrainian defenders neutralized 49 of them. The drones were launched from the territory of the Kursk, Oryol and Rostov regions of the Russian Federation, including from Millerovo, as well as from Primorsko-Akhtarsk and from the temporarily occupied Crimea from the area of Cape Chauda.\nThe main blow fell on the Kharkiv, Donetsk and Odessa regions.\nAt the same time, enemy drones were hit in seven locations, and debris fell in four. Despite the scale of the strike, Ukrainian air defense once again demonstrated high efficiency.\nLet us recall that on the night of Thursday, June 12, Russian occupation forces attacked Kharkov with kamikaze drones, 11 hits were recorded.\nAlso follow “Pryamy” on Facebook , Twitter , Telegram and Instagram.",
