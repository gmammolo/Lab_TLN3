  "text": "Under the night, there was a tense standoff in the city between police equipped with water cannons and the hundreds who had gathered. Despite the standoff, fireworks, bricks, and bottles were thrown at the police – two of which were Molotov cocktails, according to AFP's reporter on the scene.\nSome who have been affected by the violence have been evacuated to a leisure center in a nearby town, which was set on fire by masked people on Wednesday night. No one is reported to have been inside the building at the time of the attack, reports the newspaper Belfast Telegraph.\nThe disturbances broke out on Monday after a peaceful demonstration in support of a girl who is believed to have been subjected to a rape attempt. Two teenage boys with foreign backgrounds have been arrested.\nAssistant Chief of Police Ryan Henderson has called the disturbances that have now spread to more towns \"racist violence\". Residents in Ballymena, which has a large migrant population, have put up flags on their houses indicating the nationality of the residents, or hung up British flags.\nRepresentatives of both the unionist party DUP and the nationalist party Sinn Fein have called for calm.",
