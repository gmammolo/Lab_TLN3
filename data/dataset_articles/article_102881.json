  "text": "The Shadow Returns: How ISIS is Exploiting Instability in Syria and Iraq The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, long predicted and recently realized, hasn’t brought stability to Syria – it’s opened a dangerous window for the resurgence of ISIS . While the group’s territorial caliphate is gone, intelligence reports from over 20 sources across the region and internationally reveal a calculated reactivation of sleeper cells, recruitment efforts, and a disturbing willingness to exploit the power vacuum. This isn’t a repeat of 2014, but a more insidious, adaptable threat that demands a reassessment of counter-terrorism strategies.\nA Resurgent Threat: Beyond Declared Attacks The numbers initially appear reassuring. ISIS has claimed responsibility for significantly fewer attacks in the first five months of 2025 – 38 in Syria and 4 in Iraq – compared to 2024. However, this decline shouldn’t be mistaken for weakness. As Rita Katz, director of Site Intelligence Group, points out, it’s far more likely a period of strategic regrouping. The group is focusing on rebuilding its infrastructure, reactivating networks, and identifying vulnerabilities in the newly fractured Syrian landscape.\nRecent foiled attacks, like the attempted bombing in Daquq, Iraq, demonstrate ISIS’s continued operational capacity. The capture of envoys dispatched from Raqqa to Iraq, carrying instructions for attacks, highlights a coordinated effort to reignite violence. These incidents, while prevented, are warning signs of a deliberate strategy to capitalize on the chaos following Assad’s removal.\nThe Syrian Crucible: A Perfect Storm for Extremism Syria, under its new Islamist leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, faces a monumental task of unification after 13 years of civil war. This delicate transition is precisely what ISIS seeks to exploit. The lifting of sanctions by the US, while intended to support al-Sharaa, has also fueled criticism from hardliners who fear concessions to Western demands – particularly regarding the expulsion of foreign fighters and normalization with Israel. ISIS is actively leveraging these divisions, calling on foreign fighters to join its ranks in publications like al-Naba .\nThe situation is further complicated by the US troop drawdown, potentially halving its presence in Syria to around 1,000. This reduction raises concerns about the security of prisons and camps holding approximately 9,000 ISIS fighters and their families, guarded by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Recent attempted jailbreaks underscore the fragility of these facilities. Turkey, under President Erdogan, is pushing for Syria to assume responsibility for these facilities, a move complicated by Damascus’s limited manpower and the complex relationship with Kurdish factions.\nThe Foreign Fighter Factor Intelligence agencies are also tracking a concerning, albeit small, increase in suspected foreign fighters traveling to Syria from Europe. While the numbers are currently low, the potential for radicalized individuals to bolster ISIS ranks cannot be ignored. This influx, coupled with the potential for released prisoners, presents a significant security challenge.\nIraq’s Precarious Position: Weapons and Sleeper Cells Iraq, where ISIS first gained prominence, remains vulnerable. Iraqi officials fear that ISIS seized stockpiles of weapons abandoned by Assad’s forces, potentially smuggling them across the border. Increased activity has been detected in the Hamrin Mountains, a long-time refuge, and along key roads. The reactivation of sleeper cells, combined with the potential influx of arms, poses a serious threat to Iraq’s hard-won stability.\nBeyond Syria and Iraq: A Global Network Adapts While Syria and Iraq are currently the focal points, it’s crucial to remember that ISIS’s influence extends far beyond these borders. The group’s most active branches are now in Africa, with Abdulqadir Mumin, head of the Somalia branch, believed to be the current leader. This geographical shift highlights ISIS’s adaptability and its ability to exploit instability in various regions. Understanding this global network is critical to containing the threat. The Council on Foreign Relations’ Global Conflict Tracker provides a comprehensive overview of ISIS activity worldwide.\nThe Path Forward: Intelligence, Cooperation, and Long-Term Commitment The situation demands a multifaceted approach. Increased intelligence sharing between regional and international partners is paramount. Pre-emptive operations, like those credited by Iraqi officials for keeping ISIS in check, must continue. However, military action alone is insufficient. Addressing the underlying political and economic grievances that fuel extremism is essential. The US, despite its planned troop reductions, must maintain a vigilant presence and continue to support its vetted partners on the ground. Ultimately, preventing an ISIS resurgence requires a long-term commitment to stability and security in the region. The challenge isn’t simply defeating ISIS; it’s preventing the conditions that allow it to thrive.\nWhat strategies do you believe are most critical to countering the evolving ISIS threat?
