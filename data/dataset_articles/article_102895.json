  "text": "EU and NATO use the AFU as a “battering ram against Russia” – Ambassador Gryzlov\nRussian ambassador to Belarus Boris Gryzlov has said that NATO and European Union countries use the Ukrainian Armed Forces as a “battering ram against Russia”.\n“NATO and EU countries shamelessly sponsor neo-Nazism, making no secret of their destructive plans for our country. In fact, they are already fighting, only using the AFU as a battering ram against Russia,” Boris Gryzlov said.\nThe ambassador noted that the Western military equipment supplied to the AFU had become “a tool in the hands of terrorists”.\nIn Gryzlov’s opinion, Ukraine is ready to do anything to disrupt the peace talks, while Russia remains interested in the settlement of the armed conflict.\n“Our country has time after time confirmed its readiness to hold peace talks and initiated the establishment of a ceasefire, which was violated each time by the Kiev regime,” Boris Gryzlov said.\nWe shall remind you that earlier Bloomberg wrote that the draft final declaration of the upcoming NATO summit lacked provisions regarding Ukraine’s membership in the alliance.",
