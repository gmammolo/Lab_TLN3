  "text": "On 12 June 2025, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced that Russian military personnel losses since 24 February 2022 have reached 1,000,340, coinciding with Russia’s national holiday, so-called Russia Day.\nThis comes as the US presses for Kyiv-Moscow negotiations, allegedly to end the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, as Russia continues large-scale offensive operations along the entire frontline despite staggering ongoing losses, relying primarily on frontal “meat-wave” assaults to seize more Ukrainian territory. These tactics are yielding incremental gains in eastern Ukraine, prompting Russia to deploy more and more troops. A symbolic milestone on Russia Day The General Staff reported that Ukraine’s Defense Forces eliminated 1,140 Russian soldiers in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number of Russian military losses since the start of the full-scale invasion past one million.\nPreviously, the Ukrainian officials clarified that the General Staff’s figures refer specifically to Russian soldiers killed, whereas foreign sources often interpret these numbers as the combined total of those killed and wounded in action.\nThe announcement was made public through the General Staff’s official Facebook page. Notably, the seven-digit figure was reached on 12 June, a day celebrated by the Russian state as its national holiday.\nPutin won’t accept peace unless Russian empire is restored, says US ex-defense secretary Gates\nRussian equipment and weapon losses reported as of 12 June 2025:\nPersonnel: 1,000,340 in total (+1,140 yesterday) Tanks: 10,933 (+6) Armored vehicles: 22,786 (+3) Artillery systems: 29,063 (+47) MLRS: 1,413 Air defense systems: 1,184 (+1) Aircraft: 416 Helicopters: 337 Drones: 40,435 (+138) Cruise missiles: 3,337 Naval vessels: 28 Submarines: 1 Military trucks/fuel tankers: 51,715 (+136) Special equipment: 3,914 Growing pace of Russian losses The military provided a breakdown of cumulative losses by year:\nIn 2022: 106,720 killed (average 340 per day) In 2023: 253,290 killed (average 693 per day) In 2024: 430,790 killed (average 1,177 per day) In 2025, by 4 June: over 200,000 killed (average 1,286 per day) More than 628,000 of these deaths occurred in just the last 18 months, according to the GenStaff.\nNotable peak days in Russian casualties The General Staff identified several of the deadliest days of the war:\n28 November 2024: 2,030 killed 19 December 2024: 2,200 killed 29 December 2024: 2,010 killed These dates reflect concentrated combat or high-impact Ukrainian counterstrikes during key offensives.\nYesterday in figures On 11 June 2025, there were 220 combat clashes, according to the report. That same day, Russian forces launched two missile attacks and 86 airstrikes, dropped 136 guided bombs, used 3,744 kamikaze drones, and shelled Ukrainian positions and settlements 6,064 times.\nIn response, Ukraine’s Defense Forces conducted strikes on:\n10 Russian troop, weapon, or equipment locations 5 command posts 7 artillery systems 3 ammunition depots 2 additional key targets “air defenses” You could close this page.
