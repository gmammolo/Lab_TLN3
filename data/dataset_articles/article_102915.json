  "text": "China restated its opposition to the AUKUS nuclear submarine agreement after the Trump administration initiated a review of the trilateral defense pact.\nThe Pentagon review will determine whether the alliance between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia aligns with Trump's \"America First\" policy priorities.\nThe AUKUS defense pact , established in 2021, centers on providing Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines, costing $240 billion, and sharing cutting-edge military technologies among the three allied nations.\nIt is intended to lead to an expansion of patrols of the Indo-Pacific region by Western allies, and forms part of the strategic plan to counter China.\nBeijing delivered its response during a scheduled press conference, warning against increased regional military competition and nuclear proliferation.\nWhy It Matters The AUKUS review marks a critical moment for international security partnerships and power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific, a region central to American strategic interests.\nThe U.S. has made clear it sees the great power competition with China as its geopolitical priority. But the review fits with a pattern of uncertainty about the strength of U.S. commitment to its alliances, echoed in the debate about its future role in NATO .\nWhat To Know The Pentagon confirmed a formal review of the AUKUS security partnership to assess whether it serves U.S. interests under Trump's \"America First\" agenda.\nA spokesperson for the Pentagon told several publications that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has \"made clear\" this \"means ensuring the highest readiness of our service members, that allies step up fully to do their part for collective defense, and that the defense industrial base is meeting our needs.\"\n\"Any changes to the administration's approach for AUKUS will be communicated through official channels, when appropriate,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe review is headed by Elbridge Colby, under secretary of Defense for Policy, who has previously questioned sharing advanced submarine technology amid global tensions, the British newspaper Financial Times reported.\nThe Biden-era agreement involved the U.S. selling up to five Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines to Australia from 2032, followed by a jointly developed submarine with the U.K. and Australia in the 2040s.\nFile photo: U.S. Navy personnel stand atop USS 'New Hampshire' at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on April 29, 2025.

CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images China articulated its repeated objections to the AUKUS partnership, arguing the agreement threatens stability in the Indo-Pacific and would worsen the arms race.\nAUKUS has faced criticism from Beijing since its inception, with official statements warning of increased nuclear proliferation and regional instability as a result of the collaboration among Western military powers.\nAustralian officials reacted calmly to the news, describing the review as a normal process for a new U.S. administration. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles said the long-term pact was central to his country's security and would still go ahead.\nAn official spokesperson for the U.K. Ministry of Defence called the arrangement \"one of the most strategically important partnerships in decades,\" reaffirming London's support for the submarine project and related defense technology sharing. The spokesperson said it was \"understandable\" for new administrations to conduct such reviews.\nThe AUKUS pact positions Australia to become only the seventh country to possess and operate nuclear submarines, boosting regional patrol capabilities. From 2027, U.S. and U.K. nuclear-powered submarines will be rotated through Perth, Australia, as part of the current AUKUS agreement.\nWhat People Are Saying Lin Jian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a Thursday briefing : \"China has made clear more than once its position on the so-called trilateral security partnership between the U.S., U.K., and Australia, designed to advance cooperation on nuclear submarines and other cutting-edge military technologies … We oppose manufacturing bloc confrontations and anything that amplifies the risk of nuclear proliferation and exacerbates the arms race.\"\nRichard Marles, Australian defense minister, said to ABC Radio Melbourne on June 12 : \"I'm very confident this is going to happen … This is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think, whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken.\"\nA U.K. Ministry of Defence spokesperson said in a statement to BBC News : \"AUKUS is a landmark security and defence partnership with two of our closest allies. It is one of the most strategically important partnerships in decades, supporting peace and security in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic, while also delivering jobs and economic growth in communities across all three nations.\"\nWhat Happens Next The Pentagon review, led by Elbridge Colby, is ongoing and expected to conclude ahead of the anticipated release of the Trump Administration's revised National Defense Strategy in August 2025.\nAustralian, U.K., and U.S. officials are scheduled to continue talks on defense coordination and financial commitments, with additional updates expected at the forthcoming G7 summit in Canada.",
