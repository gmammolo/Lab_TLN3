  "text": "The international arrest of a fugitive Ojai murder suspect came with an even bigger surprise; he’s the suspect in a separate Ventura homicide from two years earlier.\nOn the morning of May 31, 2025, neighbors discovered Carolyn Nino De Rivera, 26, dead at her home on Sisar Road in the Upper Ojai Valley, an unincorporated area in the mountains northwest of Santa Paula. Suspicion quickly focused on Christian Alexandre Hillairet, a local handyman, investigators said.\nA search was launched but wasn’t concluded until after authorities determined Hillairet, 25, had absconded to Rosarito, Mexico, where he was arrested. Ventura County detectives and a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent met Mexican authorities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry on June 4, where Hillairet was transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service and subsequently to Ventura County authorities.\nAfter his return to Ventura County, the Ventura County District Attorney’s office announced that Hillairet was charged with not one but two separate murders.\nIn addition to De Rivera, he is also charged with the November 2023 slaying of Ventura resident William Thompson, who was allegedly bludgeoned to death by some kind of weapon.\n“The defendant’s alleged actions reflect a chilling pattern of violence and cruelty,” District Attorney Erik Nasarenko said in a news release. “Our office is committed to securing justice for these victims and prosecuting Hillairet to the fullest extent of the law.”\nHillairet is facing two counts of murder and numerous special allegations, including multiple murder, that make him eligible for the death penalty. It is also alleged he has committed serious prior violent felonies.\nDuring his first court appearance on June 6, the Ventura County Public Defender’s Office was appointed to represent Hillairet and Judge Kristi Peariso ordered that he remain in custody on a no-bail hold, according to court records. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges and is due back in court on July 8.",
