  "text": "Trump On Russia's War Against Ukraine: 'Who Would Think That A Drone Turned Out To Be Such A Powerful Weapon?'\nMENAFN- UkrinForm) The war between Russia and Ukraine has demonstrated that unmanned aerial vehicles are a powerful weapon in modern warfare.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said this in an interview with journalist Miranda Devine for the Pod Force One program, according to Ukrinform.\n\"Drones is a new thing. It's a new weapon. It's a weapon of choice. If you look at the war -- this horrible war with Russia, Ukraine that we're trying to get over -- it's all drone warfare,\" he said.\n\"It's amazing,\" Trump continued. He added that drones are \"fast and smart\" and that \"three years ago, nobody had any idea that they would be so good.\"Read also: 'Watch what is going on every night': Usyk invites Trump to spend a week in Ukraine\nAccording to Trump, drones \"really are weapons for warfare,\" and \"both sides are using drones to a level that nobody ever thought possible.\"\n\"Who would think that a drone turned out to be such a powerful weapon! But it's replacing a lot of other weapons -- even airplanes,\" Trump said.\nPhoto: White House\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
