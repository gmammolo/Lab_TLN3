  "text": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's administration is discouraging governments around the world from attending a UN conference next week on a possible two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, according to a US cable seen by Reuters.\nThe diplomatic demarche, sent on Tuesday, says countries that take \"anti-Israel actions\" following the conference will be viewed as acting in opposition to US foreign policy interests and could face diplomatic consequences from Washington.\nThe demarche, which was not previously reported, runs squarely against the diplomacy of two close allies France and Saudi Arabia, who are co-hosting the gathering next week in New York that aims to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel's security.\n\"We are urging governments not to participate in the conference, which we view as counterproductive to ongoing, life-saving efforts to end the war in Gaza and free hostages,\" read the cable.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has suggested France could recognise a Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territories at the conference. French officials say they have been working to avoid a clash with the US, Israel's staunchest major ally.\n\"The United States opposes any steps that would unilaterally recognise a conjectural Palestinian state, which adds significant legal and political obstacles to the eventual resolution of the conflict and could coerce Israel during a war, thereby supporting its enemies,\" the cable read.\nThe United States for decades backed a two-state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians that would create a state for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza alongside Israel.\nTrump, in his first term, was relatively tepid in his approach to a two-state solution, a longtime pillar of US Middle East policy. The Republican president has given little sign of where he stands on the issue in his second term.\nBut on Tuesday, the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, a long-time vocal supporter of Israel, said he did not think an independent Palestinian state remained a US foreign policy goal.\n\"Unilaterally recognising a Palestinian state would effectively render Oct. 7 Palestinian Independence Day,\" the cable read, referring to when Hamas carried out a cross-border attack from Gaza on Israel in 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages.\nHamas' attack triggered Israel's air and ground war in Gaza, in which almost 55,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of the 2.3 million population displaced and the enclave widely reduced to rubble.\nIf Macron went ahead, France, home to Europe's largest Jewish and Muslim communities, would become the first Western heavyweight to recognise a Palestinian state.\nThis could lend greater momentum to a movement hitherto dominated by smaller nations generally more critical of Israel.\nMacron's stance has shifted amid Israel's intensified Gaza offensive and escalating violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, and there is a growing sense of urgency in Paris to act now before the idea of a two-state solution vanishes forever.\nThe US cable said Washington had worked tirelessly with Egypt and Qatar to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, free the hostages and end the conflict.\nThis week Britain and Canada, also G7 allies of the United States, were joined by other countries in placing sanctions on two Israeli far-right government ministers to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the Gaza war to an end.\n\"The United States opposes the implied support of the conference for potential actions including boycotts and sanctions on Israel as well as other punitive measures,\" the cable read.\nIsrael has repeatedly criticised the conference, saying it rewards Hamas for the attack on Israel, and it has lobbied France against recognising a Palestinian state.\n\"Nothing surprises me anymore, but I don't see how many countries could step back on their participation,\" said a European diplomat, who asked for anonymity due to the subject's sensitivity.\n\"This is bullying, and of a stupid type.\"",
