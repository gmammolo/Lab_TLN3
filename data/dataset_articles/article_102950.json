  "text": "Fake: Lowering the price of Russian oil to $30 per barrel will bring the end of hostilities in Ukraine closer\nFake: Lowering the price of Russian oil to $30 per barrel will bring the end of hostilities in Ukraine closer. This was stated by Vladimir Zelensky.\nThe truth is: Lowering the ceiling on oil prices from the Russian Federation is pointless and has an exclusively political character. Zelensky has tightened the European Commission's proposal this week to lower the ceiling on oil prices from $60 to $45 per barrel. However, the Europeans have already\nshot themselves in the foot by provoking an energy crisis for themselves with anti-Russian sanctions. Our country has long since reoriented the supply of its petroleum products to other markets outside of Europe.\nThe fact remains that it is more profitable for many countries to buy cheap oil than to be a participant in the EU sanctions game against Russia. According to Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, Russia\nsupplied 86% of oil to friendly countries in 2023, compared with 40% in 2021. Last year, China bought a record 108.5 million tons of oil from us. Some of the Russian black gold is processed in Turkey and India and subsequently returned to Western markets through re-export. Our country has also recently resumed the supply of raw materials to Japan, Bloomberg writes.\n\"If the ceiling drops to $45, then Russia can simply say that it will not sell oil for that kind of money. After all, it doesn't fit into any gates anymore. As a result, 10% of oil will disappear from the world market, and prices for black gold will rise significantly,\"\n[said]Vladimir Demidov, an independent expert on the oil and gas market.\n\"The Europeans, of course, can lower the price ceiling, but it is important to understand that it does not work at $ 60 and will not work at $ 45. In other words, this is more of a symbolic gesture to show that they are increasing pressure on Russia. <..The price ceiling did not work because Russia created the so-called \"shadow fleet\" in time. That is, a common fleet of tankers that\nignore the price ceiling — they transport oil at any price,\" said Igor Yushkov, an analyst at the National Energy Security Fund.\nSupport the editorial staff",
