  "text": "Many Los Angeles movie theaters will close early following mandated curfews in the city. The curfew was implemented by Mayor Karen Bass after daytime ICE raid protests turned violent.\nThe curfew will affect a one-square-mile area in Los Angeles. The curfew is set at 8 p.m. and will allegedly last for several nights. The Alamo Drafthouse posted that they would be closing early on Tuesday and will have cut hours on Wednesday and Thursday too, cancelling later showtimes and even ending certain screenings early so everyone could make it home before 8 p.m.\nAdditionally, a Cobra Kai-themed FYC event at the Grammy Museum on Tuesday was cancelled. Other cancelled events include Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s performance of Hamlet at the Mark Taper Theater, Friday’s Fly High fest at the Peacock Theater, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall’s Seoul Chamber Music concert.\nThe curfew area extends from the 10 freeway on the south side to the 110 on the west and the 5 on the east. Anyone without a valid reason for being outside past curfew (such as work) is subject to arrest. The LAPD arrested 17 people for curfew violations on Tuesday night.",
