  "text": "NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!\nNorth Korean ballistic missiles once again rained down over Ukraine this week as the war with Russia continues to rage, prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew warnings that the threat posed by the Moscow-Pyongyang alliance is “extremely dangerous” for Europe and Asia alike.\n“The longer this war continues on our territory, the more warfare technologies evolve, and the greater the threat will be to everyone,” Zelenskyy said Tuesday. “This must be addressed now, not when thousands of upgraded Shahed drones and ballistic missiles begin to threaten Seoul and Tokyo.”\nZelenskyy’s warning came just one day after Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, confirmed in an interview with The War Zone that Russia has significantly improved North Korea’s KN-23 ballistic missiles.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy lays flowers as he pays tribute to 12 people killed by the Russian ballistic missile in Kyiv, Ukraine, on April 25, 2025.

And Russians are helping them with this.”",
