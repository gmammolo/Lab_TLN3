  "text": "The decision by the United States to review the AUKUS submarine deal with two of its most faithful allies has rung alarm bells in Canberra, despite the claims from our leaders that we have nothing to fear.\nIn some ways, the review was inevitable. Last October, a US Congressional Research Service report showed America’s boat-building program was behind schedule and nowhere near able to supply the first of Australia’s AUKUS nuclear submarines on time.\nCredit: AFR\nThe US review is being carried out under President Donald Trump’s “America First” mantra and his nation’s ongoing political instability suggests Australia would be wise to conduct its own oversight.\nUnder the first pillar of the pact, Australia will buy three to five nuclear-powered submarines from the US, starting in the 2030s, and build more through a joint initiative with the US and UK. Under the second pillar, the three nations will collaborate on advanced defence technologies. Australia is also contributing at least $4.6 billion to the US defence industrial base to shore up submarine production; $800 million has already been paid . The deal was announced in 2021 under then prime minister Scott Morrison and then US president Joe Biden.\nTrump’s “America First” has distorted many accepted beliefs about alliances. The US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth’s intimidatory call for Australia to boost defence spending by tens of billions of dollars to 3.5 per cent of GDP in the near term was a clear trampling of sovereignty brushed aside by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nNow with Trump banging the drum loudly on China and Taiwan, the US review accentuates Australia’s sovereignty vulnerability in signing up to the trilateral security partnership that permits a US president to refuse to release the boats to Australia if it is required for American defence priorities.\nThe AUKUS partnership was built on a mutual strength, obligations and respect for sovereignty. The “America Alone” mindset, while playing big to some of the folks back home, has echoes of the 1930s that, if allowed to fully flower, will further weaken America as world admiration for its values fades.\nThe University of Sydney’s United States Studies Centre found support for AUKUS’s second pillar funding and future translation of basic research into capability was nascent and unco-ordinated. Given such problems, it is entirely possible that the timing of the review announcement and Trump’s obsession with being seen to obtain the best deal in all circumstances are attempts to unbalance Albanese on the eve of their expected meeting at next week’s G7 summit, and gain Australian concessions.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles indicated there were no contingency plans should the AUKUS partnership sink. “Chopping and changing guarantees, you will never have the capability ... There is a plan here, we are sticking to it, and we’re going to deliver it,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\nMarles has a point. It is one of the reasons the submarine replacement program is now on the back foot. But it would be negligent to pretend everything is fine when it is clearly not.\nBevan Shields sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week. Sign up to receive his Note from the Editor .",
