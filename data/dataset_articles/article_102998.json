  "text": "[guest post by Dana]\nCan there be any doubt that the United States supports Russia in its efforts to destroy Ukraine as we know it? Can there be any doubt that Trump cozied up to Putin, thinking he’s a wiseguy just like the president of Russia, but the truth is, Putin is pulling the strings of Trump, the clueless puppet. Trump betrays all freedom-loving Americans and Ukrainians.\nBy the way, let’s looks at some of Russia’s “aspirations,” such as committing a genocide against the Ukrainian people by intentionally targeting and bombing civilian centers and private homes:\nKharkiv, after tonight's Russian drone strike. At least 12 people injured. Homes destroyed. Russia does this every single day. pic.twitter.com/YgTdQDN1AK\n— Kate from Kharkiv (@BohuslavskaKate) June 12, 2025\nI mean, WTAF?\n—Dana",
