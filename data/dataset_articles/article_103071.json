  "text": "The Iranian outlet IranView24 published the first batch of documents overnight Thursday, purportedly taken from what Tehran is calling \"the greatest blow to Israeli intelligence\" in history.\nThough the documents do not appear to contain any concrete evidence, they are being used to accuse International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi of cooperating with Israel. The publication comes less than a month after a scathing report accused Iran of concealing aspects of its nuclear activities and moving dangerously close to developing nuclear weapons. As of this writing, the IAEA's Board of Governors is deliberating on whether to declare Iran in violation of its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nThe leaked documents seem to relate to correspondence involving Meirav Zafary-Odiz, Israel's ambassador to the IAEA. The first document is an Israeli request to meet with Grossi in his capacity at the time as chair of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). The request references \"recent developments\", a phrase that Iranian media links to a missile test conducted by Tehran around that period.\nAnother correspondence includes an email exchange between Zafary-Odiz and a representative of the University of Washington regarding a possible panel participation. The Iranian outlet claims the person she was corresponding with, identified as \"Ali,\" is an IAEA representative, though this allegation remains unsubstantiated.\nFor several months, Iran has been running a smear campaign against Grossi, centered largely on the damning report released about two weeks ago. Accusations of collaboration with Israel had already surfaced in connection with the alleged \"document theft,\" and Grossi himself addressed the issue, stating the materials in question likely pertain to Israel's Soreq Nuclear Research Center, which is under IAEA oversight.",
