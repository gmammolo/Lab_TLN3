  "text": "Israel preparing to launch attack on Iran, US media claims\nWorld\nIf Iran was subjected to strikes it would retaliate by hitting US bases in the region: Aziz\nWASHINGTON (Web Desk/Reuters) – Israel is reportedly making preparations for a strike against Iran if ongoing talks between the US and Iran fail.\nAmerican media reported that Israel has made it clear that it is fully prepared for a major operation inside Iran.\nAmid fears of the escalation, US President Donald Trump said US personnel were being moved out of the Middle East because \"it could be a dangerous place,\" adding that the United States would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.\nReuters reported earlier on Wednesday that the U.S. is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy and will allow military dependents to leave locations around the Middle East due to heightened security risks in the region, according to U.S. and Iraqi sources.\nThe four US and two Iraqi sources did not say what security risks had prompted the decision and reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than 4%.\nA US official said the State Department had authorized voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.\nThe State Department updated its worldwide travel advisory on Wednesday evening to reflect the latest U.S. posture. “On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel due to heightened regional tensions,” the advisory said.\nThe decision by the U.S. to evacuate some personnel comes at a volatile moment in the region. Trump's efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran appear to be deadlocked and U.S. intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations for a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\"They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens,\" Trump told reporters. \"We've given notice to move out.\"\nAsked whether anything can be done to lower the temperature in the region, Trump said: \"They can't have a nuclear weapon. Very simple, they can't have a nuclear weapon.\"\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail and in an interview released earlier on Wednesday said he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to stop enriching uranium, a key American demand.\nIranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh also said on Wednesday that if Iran was subjected to strikes it would retaliate by hitting U.S. bases in the region.\nThe U.S. embassy in Kuwait said in a statement on Wednesday that it had \"not changed its staffing posture and remains fully operational.\"",
