  "text": "Error message\nAn error occurred while searching, try again later.\nTHE Palestinian death toll from the 20-month Israeli war on the Palestinians in Gaza has climbed past 55,000, the enclave’s Health Ministry said today.\nThe ministry said that women and children make up more than half the dead.\nThis comes as the Israelis kill dozens of Palestinian aid seekers in Gaza.\nIt’s a grim milestone in the Israeli retaliation to the attack by Hamas and its allies on southern Israel on October 7 2023, and shows no sign of ending.\nIsrael claims to only target militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of hiding among civilians, because they operate in populated areas.\nThe ministry says 55,104 people have been killed since the start of the war and 127,394 wounded. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to local medics.\nA nearly three-month blockade imposed by Israel when it ended a ceasefire with Hamas raised fears of famine and was slightly eased in May.\nThe launch of a new Israeli and United States-backed aid system has been marred by chaos and violence, and the UN says it has struggled to bring in food because of Israeli restrictions, a breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting.\nIsrael accuses Hamas, without evidence, of siphoning off aid, but the United Nations and aid groups deny there is any systematic diversion of aid to militants.\nAt least 120 Palestinians have been killed and 474 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza since Tuesday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Three bodies of those killed previously were also recovered from the rubble.\nAt least 57 aid seekers were killed and more than 363 injured by Israel since this morning, bringing the total number of people killed at aid distribution centres to 224, with 1,858 others injured, the ministry added.\nThe Israeli military has admitted its troops fired “warning shots” in the area of the Netzarim Corridor, where the majority of aid seekers were reported killed, adding that it is “aware of reports regarding individuals injured, the details are under review.\"”\nMeanwhile, a convoy carrying hundreds of activists has arrived in Libya after driving from Algeria and crossing through Tunisia on its way to the Gaza Strip to challenge Israel’s blockade on humanitarian aid on the territory.\nThe convoy is made up of at least 1,500 people, including activists and supporters from Algeria and Tunisia, with more expected to join from Libya.",
