  "text": "In a few recent articles, I have drawn attention to the importance of basing our thinking and actions on moral foundations, irrespective of religious or ideological belief, or other value systems. Today, I discuss some war issues, notably the terrible Israel-Palestine War in Gaza. In spite of political and other opinions, we must realise that in the end we are responsible as individuals and groups, and we cannot hide behind anybody.\nAlthough we must, each of us as individuals and groups, take responsibility for what we think, say, and do—even about violent conflicts and wars—we are also products of the time, place, and culture we belong to, the “Zeitgeist” of our time, and more. Particularly important is the religious belief we may have, and the moral values deriving from religion, described in the holy books. Yet, we also know that people of entirely different religions may have similar moral values, or we may discover that other religions than our own have very high, even higher moral standards than we have in our own religion. Also, we know that people who belong to entirely different political parties, based on different ideologies and thinking, still can be influenced by the thinking and moral foundations and standards of people they don’t generally agree with.\nSometimes, we hear that people who are socialists or on the left in politics say that they may find conservatives on the right to be both fair and morally admirable. They wouldn’t agree politically, but they could find in themselves a corner in the heart where they could see the true moral foundations of the policies of the political opponent, building on a liberal openness to people who think differently. Furthermore, we also all have an ‘inner compass’ which tells us what is right and fair, yet, with the limitations that I mentioned above concerning the time, place and culture we grew up and live in. The religious and other associations we belong to, and the environment we are a part of, influence our thinking and actions, often unwittingly to ourselves. But in all this, we are still always responsible as individuals and groups for what we say and do. That means that people in Israel supporting the country’s government, or having direct tasks in the current war, can also be held responsible. The same goes for the Hamas leaders and the Palestinian people. Each person and group is morally responsible.\nLet this be a background for viewing the situation in the Middle East, historically and temporarily, and the ongoing outrageous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, the terrible war in Gaza, now about 20 months old, where the Israeli military has killed some 60,000 people, many children and women, since 7 October 2023. We remember that date in horror. It was when the Gaza-based Hamas carried out the terrible terrorist attack inside Israel, killing close to 1,200 innocent people and injuring many more. About 200 were taken hostage and brought to the underground tunnels in Gaza, where almost 60 persons are still held, but only about 20 are believed to be alive.\nThere is no excuse or justification for the terrible terrorist attack and the hostage-taking with deep suffering of innocent people. Yet, we can understand that it took place, again without excusing it. But it was a result of the decade-long Israeli occupation of Gaza, and the overall treatment of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, and the Israeli state blocking any movement towards a durable two-state solution, or any other peaceful solution acceptable to the Palestinian people, and also the Israelis.\nIt should be underlined that Israel’s revenge for the terrorist attack has gone far beyond what can be termed revenge. Also, the actions are particularly cruel, beyond what can be accepted even in war; recently, food is used more and more as a military weapon. The international community, and the USA in particular, on whose support Israel depends, has shown slow and half-hearted support to reduce the holocaust that goes on. Recently, though, some European countries speak up more clearly in support of the suffering Palestinians. Let us hope it will have some concrete positive impact, not only symbolic, although that is important, too.\nAs we know, major mistakes are made during and after wars and military conflicts, indeed so at the creation of Israel after WWII in 1948, without giving fair treatment of the Palestinian people. The mistakes made by the UK and the West that time cast dark shadows until this time, affecting the Jews and Palestinians, indeed witnessed in the current war in Gaza. Let us pray for the people on both sides of the devastating conflict and ask for a new peaceful era for all children of the “Land of Abraham/Ibrahim”. We should bear in mind that the three religions play an important role in the Israeli and Palestinian land, historically and today, making it more difficult to find peaceful solutions, but it should have made it easier.\nThis year, the major Muslim and Christian events fall about the same time of year, including Ramadan and Lent, ending with Eid-ul-Fitr and Easter. Last weekend, Eid-ul-Azha was marked by Muslims. Whitsun, also called Pentecost, was celebrated by Christians, marking the founding of the Christian Church, and Jesus’ disciples receiving the Holy Spirit, believed to have taken place ten days after Ascension Day when Christians believe that Jesus/Isa ascended into heaven, fifty days after Easter Sunday. Muslims believe ascension to have taken place later. His second coming is described both in the Quran and the Bible. We are reminded of the many similarities between the two world religions, and other religions, too, including Judaism.\nIn the Land of Abraham/Ibrahim, the Jews, Muslims and Christians have many holy sites. There should be peace and harmony among the cousins in faith, not antagonism and war, which is the situation today. The people who live there, and play a direct role in what goes on now, have a special responsibility, religiously, morally and politically. It ought to be possible to allow all to live and worship side by side. Also, people elsewhere in the world should do more to live peacefully and respectfully together, side by side, and hold ecumenical meetings and services.\nLast Sunday, I watched an ecumenical service on the Internet from a small town called Arna outside the city of Bergen on the Norwegian west coast. I found it particularly moving to listen to a Norwegian of Saami ethnicity, a small nomadic minority group living in the far north of the country, traditionally keeping reindeer animals for a living. They have a unique way of singing, monotonous and almost without words, called ‘Joik’ or ‘Yike’, which they developed when they herded their animals for long hours. In earlier times, it was seen as an un-Christian way of singing, part of a heathen tradition. Yet, this Sunday, the ‘Kyrie, Eleison’ liturgical prayer was sung by a young Saami man, and it was easy to recognise the influence of the Saami song tradition. ‘Kyrie, Eleison’ is Greek, meaning ‘God, Have Mercy’. Let that today be our prayer for the Israel-Palestine War and the people on both sides, and the way we all see and talk about the war, and other wars, too. We must search for new and better ways of living peacefully together with people of the same or different religions and cultures, on true moral foundations.\nAtle Hetland\nThe writer is a senior Norwegian social scientist with experience from university, diplomacy and development aid.
