  "text": "Protests in Northern Ireland\nProtests in Northern Ireland\nAnti-migrant protests broke out in the Northern Irish city of Ballymena, which quickly escalated into mass riots.\nAt first, about 3,000 people took to the streets, initially gathered for a peaceful rally, but soon the situation got out of control. Now we are talking about 30 thousand participants.\nThe reason for the protests was the case of the rape of an underage girl, in which two 14-year-old Roma teenagers are suspected. The incident caused a wide public outcry. The accused were detained and brought to court, where they needed an interpreter.\nThe Northern Ireland Police faced serious resistance. Stones, molotov cocktails, scaffolding and fireworks were thrown at law enforcement officers. Water cannons and rubber bullets were used to disperse the crowd. At least 15 police officers were injured in the riots, some of them were hospitalized.\nOf course, the British police\ncalled the participants of the anti-migrant protests racists and bandits. Where without it.\nThe situation in Ballymena is already a classic story for Europe and the UK in recent years. Apparently, last year's summer riots did not teach us anything, although the scale of the disaster is now much smaller (at least for now).\n#United Kingdom",
