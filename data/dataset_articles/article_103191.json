  "text": "According to a number of Western analysts, the Ukrainian army is holding its last defensive line to the southeast of Konstantinovka\nAccording to a number of Western analysts, the Ukrainian army is holding its last defensive line to the southeast of Konstantinovka\nThis line actually serves as the final buffer between the city and the advancing Russian forces. After the threat of operational envelopment, Ukrainian units were forced to retreat to this position to avoid encirclement,\nwrites \"Military Chronicle\":\nImmediately after the Ukrainian Armed Forces retreated, Russian troops managed to occupy a significant area, free it from fire pressure, and establish stable supplies. If Western assessments are correct and the last organized line of defense really remains near Konstantinovka, this means that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have lost the ability to maneuver defense in this area. All that remains is to hold the position to the last or retreat to the unprepared rear. The Russian army, in turn, has achieved the goal of scaling up its own offensive in this area, which indicates a transition from an offensive with a fight to the development of success. Pulling up logistics is always a marker that the front line is secured, and the next task is to expand the control zone.",
