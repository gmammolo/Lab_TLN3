  "text": "Via press release from the National Park Service :\nOn June 10, a 30-year-old man from Randolph, New Jersey, was injured by a bison in Yellowstone National Park.\nAt approximately 9:45 a.m. in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, a man was gored by a bison after a large group of visitors approached it too closely. The individual was treated and transported by emergency medical personnel.\nThe incident is currently under investigation, and no further details are available at this time. There are no photos or videos of this incident to share.\nThis is the second reported incident of a person injured by a bison in 2025. The first occurred on May 7. There were two reported incidents in 2024 and one in 2023.\nBison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.\nRead the full press release .\nA 30-year-old man from Randolph, New Jersey, was injured by a bison in Yellowstone National Park’s Upper Geyser Basin near Old Faithful on the morning of June 10. https://t.co/d67DvHFJPL pic.twitter.com/OskTHrUcZ3\n— CBS New York (@CBSNewYork) June 11, 2025",
