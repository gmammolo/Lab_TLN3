  "text": "Worker suddenly dies at nation’s most remote brewery in Broome\nA staff member at the nation’s most remote brewery has died at work.\nMatso’s Brewery confirmed one of their team members passed away “suddenly and tragically” on Tuesday, in a statement shared to social media this week.\n“We suddenly and tragically lost one of our Matso’s team last night,” the statement read.\n“To allow us all to process this and look after each other, Matso’s will be closed (on) Wednesday.”\nEmergency services were called to the brewery about 9.25pm and found a 52-year old man unresponsive.\nHe was rushed to Broome District Hospital, where he was declared dead.\n“The death is being treated as non-suspicious, and a report will be prepared for the Coroner,” a police spokesman said.\nThe brewery is located in the Kimberley town of Broome, about 2220 km north of Perth and is a popular destination for tourists visiting the region.\nThe brewery became famous for creating the nation’s first alcoholic ginger beer and is well known for its refreshing drinks.\nIt first opened in 1997, with the owners opening a second brewery on the Sunshine Coast two years ago.\nOriginally published as Worker suddenly dies at nation’s most remote brewery in Broome\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\nSign up for our emails",
