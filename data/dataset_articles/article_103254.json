  "text": "North Korea has gone quiet along its southern border, South Korea’s military said on June 12, marking a possible de-escalation in a year-long psychological standoff between the two Koreas. The shift came just one day after South Korean President Lee Jae-myung ordered a halt to Seoul’s anti-Pyongyang loudspeaker broadcasts — a symbolic yet sensitive gesture aimed at lowering tensions.“There were no North Korean loudspeaker broadcasts detected today,” South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, fueling speculation that Pyongyang may have responded in kind after Seoul pulled the plug on its own campaign at 2 p.m. the day before.The North’s noise broadcasts — a mix of static, propaganda and jamming signals — had continued in parts of the western front up until late June 11, but have since stopped entirely, according to the military. Broadcast patterns had previously varied across regions, but as of June 12, the border zone was silent on both sides.Seoul had reactivated its loudspeakers in June last year in retaliation for what it described as a series of provocations from Pyongyang, including missile launches and trash-carrying balloon campaigns. North Korea followed suit a month later, unleashing a barrage of sound from its own speakers — an echo of Cold War-era tactics.Now, both campaigns appear to be paused.President Lee, who has called for a “pragmatic but principled” approach to inter-Korean relations, framed the move as a gesture toward peace — and relief for civilians living near the heavily fortified frontier.“I ordered the military to suspend loudspeaker broadcasts toward the North as of 2 p.m. on June 11,” Lee said in a social media post. “This is to ease the suffering of residents in the border area who have endured the noise for far too long.”Lee added that he hopes the measure “will reduce military tensions and help rebuild trust between the two Koreas.”",
