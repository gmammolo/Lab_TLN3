  "text": "Ballymena: baton round fired and water cannon used during third night of trouble\nPetrol bombs were hurled at police\nLast updated 6 minutes ago\nPolice fired a baton round and used water cannon to disperse a crowd during a third night of disruption in Ballymena.\nDemonstrators who gathered on Bridge Street near the residential area were told to disperse shortly before 9pm after a firework was thrown at officers.\nOfficers, who warned they would fire the plastic baton rounds at violent individuals, also used dog units and drones in their response to the gathering.\nAt least one protester was struck by a plastic baton round fired by police while officers also used a water cannon on the crowd.\nRiot police with shields advanced on the crowd to disperse them down Bridge Street in the town.\nThey came under sustained attack as those participating in disorder hurled petrol bombs, masonry and fireworks at police vehicles and officers standing nearby.\nDuring three consecutive nights of trouble dozens of police officers have been injured during the sustained unrest while multiple properties and vehicles have been set on fire.\nElsewhere, social media footage appeared to show an established fire on train tracks running through Coleraine.",
