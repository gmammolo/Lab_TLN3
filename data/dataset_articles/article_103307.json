  "text": "A curfew is in effect for a second night in Los Angeles after nearly a week of unrest in the city over US immigration raids.\nMany people have been arrested for violating the curfew in the city center shortly after it came into effect at 20:00 p.m. local time, the BBC reports.\nNearly 400 people have been arrested in Los Angeles since the protests began on Friday, including 330 undocumented immigrants and 157 people arrested for assault and obstruction, including one for attempted murder of a police officer.\nFederal prosecutors have so far charged two men with throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers in two separate incidents.\nA total of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines have been deployed to help quell the unrest. Some of these National Guard troops are now authorized to detain people until police arrest them.\nAs the overnight curfew began, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wrote on X that it was set to \"stop the bad actors who are taking advantage of the president's chaotic escalation.\"\nBass has previously blamed President Trump's immigration raids for the demonstrations, which she said \"provoked\" residents by causing \"fear\" and \"panic.\"\nBass has suggested that Los Angeles is \"part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in taking power from a local government, from a local jurisdiction.\"\nShe has called on the administration to end the raids.\nThe curfew order affects an area of about a square mile in the second largest city in the US.",
