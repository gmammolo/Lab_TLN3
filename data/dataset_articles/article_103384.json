  "text": "As first-degree murder defendant Jyer ‘Markis Jenkins, 20, walked from a holding cell and into Highlands County Circuit Court Judge David Ward’s courtroom in Sebring on Monday morning, more than a dozen relatives and friends were in the spectators gallery to show support.\nThe Lake Placid residents were not in the courtroom to support Jenkins, but to seek justice for Elijah Daley, the young man Jenkins and four others are accused of murdering at the Lake Placid Ramada Inn on May 8. Jenkins and four others – La’Niyah Nevaeh McLeod, 19, of North Port; J’Mari Mitchell, 18, of Lake Placid; Yoshabelle “Yoshi” Edouard, 19, of Port Charlotte; and Latarius Lamar Johnson, 26, of Lake Placid entered not guilty pleas in Daley’s murder. Detectives believe the five defendants – whom Daley knew well – set him up to be robbed at gunpoint in the Ramada motel room.",
