  "text": "While the crimes of genocide continue unabated in the slaughtered Gaza Strip, and dozens of starving women, children, youth, and elderly are killed daily in front of the traps of illegitimate aid in Rafah and Netzarim, a frenzied attack is taking place simultaneously in the cities, villages, and camps of the West Bank, where the aggressors are seized by a lust for killing, destruction, demolition, confiscation, and deportation, amid weak international positions that encourage the criminals to impose false facts with the power of arrogance more than they deter them and curb their encroachment on the land and the people.\nFrom now until the 17th of this month, the date set for the two-state solution conference in New York, the plans for a decisive outcome are racing against the plans for a solution, in implementation of Smotrich's plans to annex the West Bank. The man obsessed with undermining the authority and imposing control seems to be biting off more than he can digest, according to what is indicated by field evidence of confiscated lands and homes threatened with demolition in villages and in camps that have been violated by bulldozing, which have become empty of their residents, and people are being crammed into the narrowest areas after the villagers' lands were seized, and their cultivation and construction were prevented, as part of plans for geographic and demographic engineering.\nWhile international justice has failed to prevent the genocide in the Gaza Strip, deep doubts surround the expected international positions regarding the recognition of the State of Palestine, based on the two-state solution vision. Meanwhile, the United States has threatened to boycott the countries participating in the conference and condemned the sanctions imposed by five European countries against Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. Through its policies of appeasement and its declared partnership with Israel in its ongoing crimes, America confirms that it is the exclusive sponsor of genocide and the undermining of security, peace, and stability in the region.\nOPINIONS\nThu 12 Jun 2025 9:23 am - Jerusalem Time\nDecision plans race against solution plans!\nTags\nShare your opinion\nDecision plans race against solution plans!\nMORE FROM OPINIONS\nInternational anger over US veto in Security Council\nIs political Islam still a global project?
