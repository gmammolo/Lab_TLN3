  "text": "IndiaPosted at: Jun 12 2025 12:52PM Jairam slams US invite to Pak Army chief, calls it diplomatic setback for IndiaNew Delhi, June 12 (UNI) Amid reports that Pakistan Army Chief Gen Asim Munir has been invited for the US Army Day on June 14, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Thursday termed it a \"major diplomatic and strategic setback\" for India.Taking to X, Ramesh questioned the United States' intent, pointing out that General Munir is the same person who made provocative remarks shortly before the Pahalgam terror attack. He also criticised the recent remarks by the US Central Command chief, who described Pakistan as a \"great partner\" in counter-terrorism efforts. \"The Modi government is saying that Operation Sindoor is still underway; in such a situation, the participation of the Pakistani Army Chief as a guest at the US Army Day event is undoubtedly a matter of serious concern,\" Ramesh said. The Rajya Sabha MP further said, “The Trump administration is consistently making statements that can only be interpreted to mean that the US is viewing India and Pakistan through the same lens. The Prime Minister has only recently welcomed the delegation that had briefed the global community, including the United States, on Pakistan’s involvement in supporting terrorism, yet simultaneously, reports from Washington DC are surfacing that further undermine India’s diplomatic standing.\"Ramesh demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi shed his \"obstinacy and prestige\", and immediately convene an all-party meeting and a special session of Parliament to present a unified national stance and chalk out a clear roadmap. “Decades of diplomatic progress cannot be easily undermined,” he added.UNI RBE PRSTags:",
