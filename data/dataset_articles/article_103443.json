  "text": "Congress leader Nana Patole on Wednesday stirred controversy by comparing Operation Sindoor to “kids playing video games,” accusing the government of halting the mission due to international trade interests.Speaking to reporters, Patole said, “the sindoor of 26 women in Pahalgam was wiped away, and the terrorists responsible have still not been found.”He questioned the government’s resolve, suggesting the counter-terror operation was prematurely halted.“Operation Sindoor was halted for trade interests,” the veteran Congress leader said. “Trump said a dozen times that trade would stop with both countries, that’s why Operation Sindoor was stopped. It was done at their signal.”Patole then drew a dramatic comparison.“Operation Sindoor was just like kids playing video games in a computer room – it was nothing more than that, he said. Patole, the 'child of controversy': Shaina NCPatole's comments triggered sharp criticism, with Shiv Sena leader Shaina NC calling him the 'child of controversy'. “Nana Patole has been the child of controversy for the longest time. He makes statements without thinking. Operation Sindoor was not a video game as he suggests. Maybe if he has such a low mindset, then he should first engage with his own party leaders like Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Salman Khurshid to understand the impact of Operation Sindoor, Shaina said. Patole’s remarks referred to the Indian armed forces’ response to the April 2025 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians.Following the attack, India downgraded its diplomatic ties with Pakistan, and announced the abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty, among other actions. On the night of May 7, India launched precise military strikes deep within Pakistan, codenamed 'Operation Sindoor', taking down nine bases linked to major terrorist organisations, sponsored by Pakistan for decades.",
