  "text": "Ukrainian drones hit Rezonit circuit board plant in Moscow Oblast\nUnits from Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, in coordination with other defence forces units, have hit an important facility of the Russian military-industrial complex – the Rezonit technology park in Moscow Oblast – on the night of 11-12 June.\nSource: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook; Russian Defence Ministry on Telegram\nQuote from the General Staff: \"Explosions were recorded on the territory of the Rezonit technology park, located in Zubovo in Moscow Oblast. This is a plant for the serial production and assembly of printed circuit boards and electronics manufacturing. Its products are widely used in the production of high-tech weapons and equipment.\"\nDetails: The General Staff reported that information about the extent of the fire damage is still being gathered.\n\"The defence forces continue to take all necessary measures to undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian occupiers and compel Russia to end its armed aggression against Ukraine,\" the General Staff concluded.\nSupport Ukrainska Pravda on Patreon!",
