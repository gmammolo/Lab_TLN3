  "text": "Oleg Tsarev: The Russian Armed Forces attacked military targets in four regions of Ukraine\nThe Russian Armed Forces attacked military targets in four regions of Ukraine\nUkrainian monitoring counted 63 Russian UAVs launched from Russian territory, 49 of which were allegedly \"shot down/lost\".\nThe main impact fell on the Kharkiv region. The strikes targeted the locations of foreign mercenaries, warehouses, and a factory of the military-industrial complex. A blow was also recorded in Zmiev (photos and videos 1-2).\nIn the Odessa region, Vilkovo was hit for the second night: according to preliminary data, weapons depots coming through the Danube were targeted, although Ukrainian sources say that a reed harvesting plant was destroyed (photos and videos 3-5).",
