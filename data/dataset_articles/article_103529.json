  "text": "Whitney Decker called the police when her three daughters didn’t come back from a planned visitation with their dad.\nIt was May 30, and their dad, Travis Decker, was supposed to return them after the scheduled visit. But he didn’t show up, and Whitney couldn’t get through to him.\nShe said his phone kept going straight to voicemail. Days later, on Monday afternoon, the girls were found dead at a campsite about 40 miles from their home in Wenatchee.\nTheir bodies were discovered at a campsite off a mountain trail Whitney Decker A sheriff’s deputy found the girls’ bodies three days after they were supposed to return.\nThey were down an embankment at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains. It was just west of Leavenworth, not far from the Pacific Crest Trail.\nOfficials say the girls were suffocated and restrained Whitney Decker The autopsy later confirmed the girls were suffocated.\nThey’d been tied up with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads, according to investigators.\nClues at the site pointed investigators toward their father Wenatchee Police Department At the campsite, police found Decker’s truck abandoned.\nIt had two bloody handprints on the tailgate. One blood sample at the scene belonged to a male, and another was from an animal.\nDecker’s dog was also found alive and taken to the humane society.\nA possible sighting has fueled an ongoing manhunt Chelan County Sheriff’s Office Decker still hasn’t been found, but authorities believe they might have seen him.\nA group of hikers spotted a man acting strangely in the Enchantments area. He looked unprepared and seemed to be avoiding people.\nLater, a helicopter saw a solo hiker near Colchuck Lake. He ran the moment the helicopter passed over.\nTeams have been searching forests, trails, and backcountry areas Embed from Getty Images\nTracking dogs picked up a trail near Ingalls Creek Trailhead on Highway 97.\nAuthorities say they’ve searched hundreds of square miles, covering mountains, water, and remote terrain.\nChelan County Sheriff’s Office is still leading the criminal case, but they’ve handed over search operations to federal teams for now.\nDecker’s military experience and survival skills are a challenge Whitney Decker Decker’s background is making the search harder.\nHe served in the Army from 2013 to 2021, including time in Afghanistan and the 75th Ranger Regiment.\nOfficials say he knows how to navigate, survive outdoors, and even live off the grid. He once stayed in the wilderness for two and a half months.\nBefore the murders, Decker searched for ways to move to Canada Facebook | Travis Decker Right before this happened, Decker had looked up how to relocate and work in Canada.\nHe’s now facing a federal charge for fleeing to avoid prosecution.\nThe mother is pushing to fix the Amber Alert system Facebook | Katle Vogel Whitney Decker believes an earlier Amber Alert could have changed the outcome.\n“She’s very serious about pushing for changes,” her attorney Arianna Cozart said.\nWhitney wants to make sure the alert system works better in future cases.\nPolice are asking the public not to approach the suspect Facebook | Whitney Decker Authorities say Decker is dangerous and might be armed. They’ve urged everyone not to approach him.\n“Please secure your homes and vehicles, stay alert, and report any suspicious activity to 911.”\nIf you think you’ve seen him, call it in immediately and don’t try to make contact.",
