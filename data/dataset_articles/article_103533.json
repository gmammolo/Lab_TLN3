  "text": "June 12, 2025\nLOS ANGELES: Protests over hardline immigration tactics ignited across the United States on Wednesday after days of demonstrations in Los Angeles, as California prepared for a legal showdown with the White House over US President Donald Trump’s deployment of the military.\nOver 1,000 people massed in America’s second biggest city for a sixth day of protests, with the crowd peaceful as they marched through the streets.\nA second night of curfew was expected as city leaders try to get a handle on the after-dark vandalism and looting that scarred a few city blocks in the 500-square-mile (1,300 square kilometres) metropolis.\n\"I would say for the most part everything is hunky dory right here at Ground Zero,\" protester Lynn Sturgis, 66, a retired school teacher, told AFP.\n\"Our city is not at all on fire, it’s not burning down, as our terrible leader is trying to tell you.\"\nThe mostly peaceful protests ignited over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants who were in the country illegally.\nPockets of violence — including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police — were nothing the 8,500 officers of the Los Angeles Police Department had not dealt with before.\nTrump won the election last year partly on promises to combat what he claims is an \"invasion\" by undocumented migrants.\nHe is now seizing the opportunity to make political capital, ordering the California National Guard to deploy despite Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, the first time a US president has taken such action in decades.\n\"We’re going to have a safe country,\" he told reporters on his way into a theatre performance.\n\"We’re not going to have what would have happened in Los Angeles. Remember, if I wasn’t there... Los Angeles would have been burning to the ground.\"\nAround 1,000 of the 4,700 troops Trump deployed were actively guarding facilities and working alongside ICE agents, said Scott Sherman, Deputy Commanding General Army North, who is leading operations.\nThe rest — including 700 active duty Marines — were mustering or undergoing training to deal with civil disturbances, he said.\nThe Pentagon has said the deployment will cost taxpayers $134 million.\nGovernor Newsom, a Democrat, has charged that Trump is seeking to escalate the confrontation for political gain.\nHis lawyers were expected in court on Thursday to demand a temporary restraining order that would prevent troops from accompanying immigration officers as they arrest migrants.\nAdministration lawyers called the application a \"crass political stunt\".\nNewsom said the unprecedented militarisation would creep beyond his state’s borders.\n\"Democracy is under assault right before our eyes,\" he said on Tuesday. \"California may be first, but it clearly won’t end here.\"\nDespite Trump’s threats to deploy the National Guard to other Democratic-run states over the objections of governors, protesters appear undeterred.\nDemonstrations were reported in St Louis, Raleigh, Manhattan, Indianapolis and Denver.\nIn San Antonio, hundreds marched and chanted near city hall, reports said, where Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott has deployed the state’s National Guard.\nA nationwide \"No Kings\" movement was expected on Saturday, when Trump will attend a highly unusual military parade in the US capital.\nThe parade, featuring warplanes and tanks, has been organised to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army but also happens to be the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.\nThe Trump administration is painting the protests as a violent threat to the nation, requiring military force to support regular immigration agents and police.\nBut Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the crisis had been manufactured in Washington.\n\"A week ago, everything was peaceful in the city of Los Angeles,\" she told reporters.\n\"Things began to be difficult on Friday when raids took place... that is the cause of the problems.\n\"This was provoked by the White House.\"\nArrests by masked and armed men continued on Wednesday.\nA pastor in the LA suburb of Downey said five armed men driving out-of-state cars grabbed a Spanish-speaking man in the church’s parking lot.\nWhen she challenged the men and asked for their badge numbers and names, they refused.\n\"They did point their rifle at me and said, ‘You need to get back,’\" Lopez told broadcaster KTLA.\nFootage seen by AFP shows what appears to be federal agents ramming a car in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles.\nSome kind of smoke device is deployed and masked men with assault weapons order a man from the car, leaving what witnesses said was his wife and children badly shaken.",
