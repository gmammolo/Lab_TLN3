  "text": "Denali as seen from the Reflection Pond. | Picture: National Park Services A skier was confirmed dead after being caught in a soft slab avalanche from below the Rescue Gully above Camp 14 on Denali, Alaska. The slide occurred on the West Buttress Route at approximately 6:15 p.m. on June 10. Nicholas Vizzini, age 29 of Washington State, and his climbing partner, a snowboarder, triggered the avalanche while descending the slope.\nAccording to the report by National Park Services , two mountaineering rangers on an acclimatization climb spotted the partner on the surface of the avalanche debris and were able to respond within minutes. After a quick assessment of the partner, a beacon search was initiated and a signal acquired. During the search, Vizzini was visually located and found to be mostly buried in the debris. The rangers immediately began digging to establish an airway. CPR was initiated but discontinued after forty minutes due to traumatic injuries and no pulse.\nThe soft slab avalanche on Denali, Alaska. | Picture:National Park Services After recovery, rangers flew the body to Talkeetna, where they transferred it to the state medical examiner. Vizzini’s partner sustained minor injuries and is scheduled to fly off the mountain today.\nRescue Gully starts at 17,200 feet on the West Buttress route. The top of where the avalanche released was approximately 16,600 feet and the avalanche ran down to approximately 15,000 feet.\nThis is the second death on Denali this climbing season. On June 4, Alex Chiu, aged 41 of Seattle, Washington, died as a result of a 3,000-foot fall from the Denali West Buttress climbing route on to the Peters Glacier.\nThis marks the 23rd avalanche related death of the 2024-25 hydrological season, which runs from October 1, 2024, to September 30, 2025. There have been approximately 13 avalanche-related deaths and more than 130 total deaths on the mountain recorded in the history of the park. There are currently 500 climbers on the mountain.\nThe climbing season on Denali is rather short and typically begins in early May and ends in early July.",
