  "text": "WASHINGTON - The United States has ordered some staff to leave the embassy in Baghdad and authorized military service members’ families to depart the Middle East, officials said, after Iran threatened to target U.S. bases if nuclear negotiations collapse.\nThe decision to reduce staffing in Iraq was “based on our latest analysis,” according to the State Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized family members of U.S. troops stationed across the region to leave, the Pentagon said in a statement.\nNeither agency cited a specific threat. However, the New York Post published an interview in which President Donald Trump said he is growing less confident about the prospects for negotiations to impose new limits on Iran’s nuclear program. Iran, meanwhile, warned of retaliation against U.S. military assets in the region if talks fail and the Islamic Republic is attacked.\n“I sincerely hope it won’t come to that and that the talks reach a resolution,” Iran’s Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said in televised remarks. “But if they don’t, and conflict is imposed on us, the other side will undoubtedly suffer greater losses. We will target all U.S. bases in host countries without hesitation.”\nWest Texas Intermediate crude futures jumped as much as 5.2% after Reuters reported that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is preparing for an ordered departure in response to rising security threats. Iraq is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nEarlier in the day, the British Navy issued a rare advisory to mariners, warning that rising tensions in the Middle East could disrupt shipping, including through the Strait of Hormuz. While shipping has long been risky in the region, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) rarely issues general alerts of this kind.\n“UKMTO has been made aware of increased tensions within the region, which could lead to an escalation of military activity having a direct impact on mariners,” the advisory stated. “Vessels are advised to transit the Arabian Gulf, Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz with caution.”\nThe Joint Maritime Information Center, part of the Combined Maritime Forces, also warned of elevated risks, including the potential use of missiles near strategic chokepoints.\nThe Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most critical oil chokepoint, and Iran has frequently threatened to close it during periods of geopolitical conflict, though it has never done so.\nHegseth’s move applies to families of U.S. service members stationed throughout the Central Command area of operations, which encompasses most of the Middle East.\n“Centcom is working in close coordination with our Department of State counterparts, as well as our allies and partners in the region to maintain a constant state of readiness to support any number of missions around the world at any time,” the Pentagon said in a statement.\nTehran said it is preparing a new proposal related to its nuclear activities ahead of the sixth round of talks in Muscat, the capital of Oman, scheduled for Sunday. The plan “can be used as a basis for work,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday, suggesting Iran may consider a temporary framework while technical issues - many of them complex - are further negotiated.\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he wants an agreement that curbs Iran’s nuclear activities and has not ruled out military action if talks fail. Israel, which considers a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat, has also said it may strike Iran - with or without U.S. support.\nIran has long denied pursuing a nuclear weapon.",
