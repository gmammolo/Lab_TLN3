  "text": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected U.S. demands to halt civilian nuclear research as \"bullying,\" while President Donald Trump warned the Middle East could become \"a dangerous place\" amid escalating regional tensions.\nPezeshkian, speaking during a visit to Ilam province, said Iran would continue negotiations but would never submit to pressure, according to Iran's official news agency IRNA.\n\"We will not bow to bullying. We will never accept reducing our research to zero and then waiting for their approval to obtain nuclear materials needed in industry, medicine, agriculture, and other sciences,\" Pezeshkian stated.\nThe Iranian president emphasized that negotiations are being conducted within the framework set by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nAddressing Washington's demands for Iran to completely halt uranium enrichment activities and nuclear research, Pezeshkian questioned the legitimacy of such requirements.\n\"Who said we need permission to conduct scientific research?\" \"Who are they to tell us to dismantle our entire nuclear industry?\" he said.\nPezeshkian stressed Iran would never abandon scientific research, adding, \"They tell us not to have this science. Then, if we say something against them, they say Israel will bomb us. When our scientists and elites built missiles, Saddam could no longer bomb our cities. Until we had missiles, he was hitting us every day.\"\nPresident Trump, speaking to reporters at the Kennedy Center in Washington while attending a musical opening with First Lady Melania Trump, commented on the withdrawal of non-essential American personnel from some Middle Eastern countries.\n\"They're pulling out because it could become a dangerous place. We'll see what happens. We issued the notification for them to withdraw. They cannot have nuclear weapons. That's very clear. They cannot have nuclear weapons. \"We will not allow it,\" Trump said.\nA U.S. State Department official, quoted in Israeli media, stated, \"President Trump is committed to keeping Americans safe both at home and abroad.\nIn line with this commitment, we continuously evaluate appropriate personnel status at all our embassies. Based on our latest analysis, we have decided to reduce our mission presence in Iraq.\"\nThe State Department has authorized the departure of non-essential personnel and family members from Bahrain and Kuwait.\nAdditionally, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the voluntary departure of military personnel's family members from various Middle East locations.\nPezeshkian called for internal unity in Iran, stating, \"If we set aside our differences, enemies will have no desire against these lands.\" They want to sow discord among us and exploit the situation to attack us.\"\nThe Iranian president maintained that not possessing nuclear weapons is a definitive and unchangeable policy for Iran while insisting on recognition of the country's legal, scientific, and international rights.\n\"We are conducting negotiations with dignity and our heads held high. Our only demand is recognition of our legal, scientific, and international rights, and we ask for nothing else,\" he said.\nTrump, in a separate post on his Truth Social platform, expressed confidence in U.S. military capabilities: \"The U.S. military will achieve victory after victory in the coming days and every future generation, I am more certain than ever. You will display endless courage. You will protect every inch of U.S. soil and defend America around the world!\"\nThe evacuations come as the Trump administration seeks a new nuclear deal with Iran while tensions between Iran and Israel continue to escalate.",
