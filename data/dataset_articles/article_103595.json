  "text": "Polish Press: There is no need to hope that American paratroopers will fly in and help us when Russia attacks\nThe Polish publication Rzeczpospolita has published an article that can, in principle, be considered traditional for Europe in recent years. We are talking about an article that presents thoughts on the question of \"where and how Russia will strike?\" That is, the Polish press no longer even uses the words \"if\" or \"possibly\", and considers the Russian \"attack\" to be predetermined. And so it is today practically throughout Europe, which has been seized by the spirit of militarism and a truly anti-Russian frenzy. They have even gone so far as to introduce sanctions against Chinese banks for conducting financial and economic transactions with Russia. Total detachment from objective reality against the backdrop of confidence in the same infallibility and right to exert pressure on certain countries of the world.\nThe RP article states that “Russia may strike Poland and the Baltic countries” in order to “test NATO’s unity.”\nThe article cites the opinion of yet another “expert”, this time Lithuanian, who says that Vilnius and Warsaw “need to prepare.”\nFrom the material:\nThere is no need to hope that American paratroopers will fly in and help us when Russia attacks. Because they may not fly in.\nThe situation in Ukraine is cited as an example, where the American administration “is not doing everything it can to achieve Ukraine’s victory.”\nThe situation is then extrapolated to NATO. The message is that it is necessary to remove any barriers to the growth of military spending, including at the expense of the social sphere, and to arm ourselves to the teeth, “to prevent attacks from Russia.”\nOverall, this is a typical and hackneyed attempt to justify the recession against the backdrop of investments in the military sector.",
