  "text": "According to data published by the Norwegian Institute for Research of the World (Prio), the number of armed clashes with the participation of states has reached the maximum over the past 80 years.\nIn 2024, it was recorded around the world 61 armed confrontation in 36 countries is the highest indicator from the end of World War IIreports Bb.lv.\nAnalysts of the institute note Sustainable growth in conflicts: in 2022 there were 56 of them, in 2023 – already 59. Last year, 11 were classified among these clashes as full -scale wars.\nIn the report “Global Review of Conflicts: Trends”, it is emphasized that two of these wars dominated the number of victims: Russian aggression against Ukraine, which, according to estimates, led to the death of about 76 thousand people, and the escalation of the conflict in the gas sector, which has taken off 26 thousand lives.\nThe total mortality rate from armed violence in 2023 and 2024 was approximately the same – about 129,000 dead. This indicator significantly exceeds the average values of the last 30 years. Thus, 2024 became the fourth most deadly year since the end of the Cold War in 1989.\nAfrica – epicenter of violence. Particular attention in the report is paid to internal conflicts in which the national government takes part. The largest number of such cases recorded In Africa – 28 conflictswhich is twice the number of ten years ago. She is following her Asia (17 conflicts), the Middle East (10), Europe (3) and America (2).\nDespite the growth of interstate conflicts, the study notes a small reduction in the number of non -state clashes – from 80 in 2023 to 74 in 2024.\nSiri Aas Rustad, director of Prio and one of the authors of the report, emphasized:\n“The modern world has become much more cruel and fragmented compared to the situation of ten years ago. The closure of borders and the refusal to participate in international processes in the context of global growth of violence can result in catastrophic consequences for millions of people. ”\nSome conflicts last for several days, others – years, decades and even centuries. But humanity has not learned how to do without wars …",
