  "text": "Adrian Weckler on LA riots lockdown: This is the curfew zone – and tensions are running high\nAs Los Angeles endures its second night of a lockdown curfew, Adrian Weckler reports from inside the curfew zone\nWithin a few minutes of entering the city’s downtown, I saw them. A group of around 100 protesters were shouting from a bridge, with flags and banners. A block away, I could see the blue and red lights of half a dozen police cars approaching, in formation. Overhead, a helicopter suddenly became audible.\nWelcome to Los Angeles after curfew.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
