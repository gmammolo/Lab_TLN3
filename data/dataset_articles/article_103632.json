  "text": "On Thursday, former Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Nana Patole stirred controversy by likening Operation Sindoor to a “computer video game,” sharply criticizing the BJP-led central government. Patole suggested that India’s External Affairs Minister had revealed the intended targets in Pakistan beforehand, allowing Pakistan to evacuate those locations. “It was as if India gave prior notice to Pakistan, making it all seem like a video game kids play on computers,” he remarked.\nIn response, Maharashtra BJP President and Revenue Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule condemned Patole’s comments, calling them offensive and accusing him of siding with Pakistan. “Labeling a strategic military operation as a game insults the bravery of our soldiers and disrespects the nation. Such statements are deeply hurtful to the families of martyrs,” Bawankule stated.\nHe emphasized that Operation Sindoor was a bold strike on terrorist hideouts in Pakistan, showcasing India’s strength and resolve. “The Congress seems to trivialize our armed forces’ sacrifices. Just like Rahul Gandhi’s statements abroad, this shows their twisted mindset,” he added. Rahul Gandhi wrote on X “EAM Jaishankar’s silence isn’t just telling — it’s damning. So I’ll ask again: How many Indian aircraft did we lose because Pakistan knew? This wasn’t a lapse. It was a crime. And the nation deserves the truth.”\nBawankule further warned that the Indian public is aware of who supports national interests and who undermines them. “Nana Patole’s remarks reflect a corrupt and anti-national mentality. The nation will not tolerate such views,” he asserted.\nPreviously, Patole had also claimed that Operation Sindoor was halted due to pressure from then-US President Donald Trump, who allegedly warned of trade consequences unless both nations agreed to a ceasefire.\nHe also raised pointed questions at the Modi government, asking why terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack remain at large and why there has been no breakthrough in uncovering their network.",
