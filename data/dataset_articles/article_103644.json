  "text": "TOKYO, Japan — Tokyo said Thursday it had expressed serious concerns to Beijing after Chinese fighter jets flew \"unusually close\" to a Japanese military patrol plane in the Pacific last weekend.\nThe incident followed the sighting of two Chinese aircraft carriers sailing in the Pacific simultaneously for the first time, including in Japan's economic waters.\nJapan said this week that the aircraft carriers' activity — described by China as \"routine training\" — showed the expanding geographic scope of Beijing's military.\nA Japanese defense ministry spokesman told Agence France-Presse on Thursday that Chinese fighter jets had flown \"unusually close\" to the Japanese patrol plane.\nOn Saturday, a Chinese J-15 fighter jet from the Shandong aircraft carrier followed a Japanese P-3C patrol plane for 40 minutes, then on Sunday two J-15 jets did the same for 80 minutes, the spokesman said.",
