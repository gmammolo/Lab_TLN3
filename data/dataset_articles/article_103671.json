  "text": "Arshdeep Singh could be handy customer in SA: Ravi Shastri wants left-arm pacer to be in mix for Test squad\nFormer India coach Ravi Shastri believes left-arm pacer Arsheep Singh could be a valuable asset for India in Test cricket, especially in overseas conditions. Shastri made these remarks after the Indian bowler’s poor performance in an innings defeat to South Africa in the Boxing Day Test.\nArshdeep’s ability to swing the ball is particularly noteworthy. He has demonstrated this skill effectively, swinging the new ball away from right-handers rather than just slanting it across. This talent was on full display during his stint in South Africa, where he showcased his skills with the white ball. His performance in the ODI series against South Africa was remarkable, as he managed to take five wickets for 37 runs in Johannesburg on December 17, 2023.\n“Two bowlers were decently experienced – Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. But then, they missed Shami big time in this Test match. Yes, Shardul has experience. He (Shardul) is not a baby, but he is not the third seamer. You need a proper third seamer in overseas conditions,” Ravi Shastri said while speaking on Star Sports.\nShastri has emphasized the importance of Arshdeep’s first-class record when considering him for the Test squad. Arshdeep has played 12 first-class matches, taking 38 wickets with an average of 29.97 and an economy rate of 3.12. He has also shown the capability to bowl long spells, which is crucial for Test cricket. In fact, earlier in 2023, Arshdeep signed with Kent to play five County Championship games, indicating his commitment to improving his ability to bowl long spells.\n“The fact is, you have to see his (Arshdeep’s) first-class record. Can he bowl long spells? Has he played a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket? I would, in fact, make him go and play a lot of Ranji Trophy cricket. Frist-class cricket. I would keep him in the mix because if someone can swing tt, like he did with the white-ball in South Africa, he could be a handy customer here,” Shastri added.\nWatch Live TV in English\nWatch Live TV in Hindi",
