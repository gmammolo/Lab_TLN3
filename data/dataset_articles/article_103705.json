  "text": "Pat Cummins' 10 wickets lead Australia to 79-run win over Pakistan in Melbourne Melbourne/IBNS: Australia captain Pat Cummins picked 10 wickets in the second Test against Pakistan, powering the hosts to clinch a 79-run victory at MCG in Melbourne and decide the fate of the series with a match to spare. Chasing a target of 317, Pakistan were bowled out by the Aussies for 237. After Mohammad Rizwan (35 off 62 balls) was sent back by Cummins, Pakistan collapsed in quick time to bite the dust in the Boxing Day Test. Cummins, who picked five wickets for 49 in the second innings, had scalped as many wickets conceding 48 runs when Pakistan batted for the first time in the match. Photo courtesy: X/@ICC The Australia captain helped his team take a comfortable lead over Pakistan, who were dismissed for 262 in reply to the hosts' 318 in the first innings. Though Pakistan were ripping apart Australia's batting order in the second innings reducing them to 16/4 at one stage, Mitchell Marsh (96), Alex Carey (53) and Steven Smith (50) did the rescue job and took the team to 262. Bagging the series 2-0 already, Australia would look to strategise for the ultimate match in Sydney where David Warner will be given a farewell.
