  "text": "A launch with great fanfare. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket lifted off Thursday night to carry the U.S. X-37B military space drone to a research mission, the U.S. company founded by Elon Musk announced. After weeks of delays, the rocket lifted off at 20:07 p.m. (01 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The liftoff was streamed live on SpaceX's website.\nNo information was available on the destination of the space drone, an unmanned shuttle, for its seventh mission. The Pentagon has released little information about the space drone and its new mission, originally scheduled to start on Dec. 7. SpaceX simply cites the Pentagon's code name for the mission -- USSF-52 -- in its release about the launch. \" Falcon Heavy launched the USSF-52 mission into orbit from launch pad 39A ,\" according to SpaceX. The Pentagon had previously announced that X-37B's seventh mission would feature \" multiple state-of-the-art experiments .\"\n«\nThese tests include the operation of the reusable space plane on new orbital regimes, the experimentation of future technologies on space domain awareness, and the study of the effects of radiation on materials supplied by NASA ,\" according to a statement issued last month by the U.S. Department of the Air Force's Office of Rapid Capabilities. The statement said it was the first time the X-37B was launched by a Falcon Heavy rocket, one of the most powerful in operation and capable of carrying payloads of up to 26,700 kilograms deep into space.\nLittle distilled information Shrouded in secrecy, the X-37B made its first flight in 2010 and spent a total of more than ten years in space during its first six missions, its manufacturer, the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing, said at the end of its sixth mission in November 2022. The X-37B was designed for the U.S. Air Force by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\nIt is nine meters long, has a wingspan of 4.5 meters, and is powered by solar panels. Its launch by the Falcon Heavy rocket comes two weeks after China launched its own space drone, named Shenlong, into orbit on December 14 for what the state-run New China Agency called \" a certain period of time \" during which scientific experiments will be conducted \" to provide technical support for the peaceful use of space .\"",
