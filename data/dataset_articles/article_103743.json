  "text": "Generations of the Camp-Strobel Family Served in the U.S. Military: Remembering Our Veterans This week's Remembering Our Veterans story features a family of service and sacrifice. The Camp-Strobel family has a place in history from the Revolutionary War to present day. Angela Rood works at UPMC Hamot as an Administrative Assistant at the Hamot School of Anesthesia. Now lets rewind to the early 90's when she enlisted in the Army, and became a military photo journalist. Her first assignment was in Berlin, Germany. \"A lot of parades, a lot of seeing Germany with the wall down, which was exciting,\" said Rood. \"After I was done there, I was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. I had my first child there, and at that point I decided it was time to get out because I was raising a family. Her military career lasted five years, the family service tree goes back hundreds of years. \"Not only did my father serve, but we have relatives that go back as far as the Revolutionary War, and I have a son who is now stationed in Germany himself. He's about to start his 10th year serving,\" said Rood. The branches include Army, Navy and Air Force for the family members. \"I think it's probably 9 or 10 cousins, and then as far as my aunts and uncles go, I think it's 9 or 10 there as well,\" said Rood. \"One of my buddies I met when I was in basic training left her home in Baltimore because you either become a drug dealer or you go in the military. She didn't want to deal drugs so she went into the military. There are no bad reasons for joining the military.\" And growing up in a military family the support groups are essential. \"My mom served as an Army wife for 24 years, that's no small deal, and the army brats,\" said Rood. \"I was one of four, we changed schools every two years, we changed friends every two years, we changed houses every two years. This is not an easy feat for us, because we have this pride in our family. I am just so impressed, and in awe of these wonderful people, and these are just the ones I know in person.\" To all members of the Camp-Strobel family. Thank your for your service and welcome home.",
