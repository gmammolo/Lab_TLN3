  "text": "Hundreds of youngsters in war-torn Ukraine enjoyed surprise Christmas boxes sent from Scotland. Big-hearted volunteers at the Tayside and Strathearn Help for Ukraine charity, based at Errol Airfield, went the extra mile to ensure Santa could visit a string of orphanages in cities across Ukraine. The TASH4Ukraine team dispatched more than 1000 boxes to Yavoriv, Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Korets, Vinnytsia and other destinations. “This fantastic project was the idea of the ladies at TASH4Ukraine,” said principal coordinator, Perth businessman Kenny Simpson. “They did an incredible job, organising car boot sales to raise money, buying presents and packing all the boxes, which were labelled by age group and gender to make distribution easier at the other end of the chain. “One of our committee members, Drew Cassidy from Dundee, travelled to Ukraine at his own expense to help distribute the Christmas boxes to families and orphanages in Ukraine. “He said it was a most heartwarming and humbling experience. “Not surprisingly the feedback we are getting from Ukraine has been wonderful. “Their work has certainly been appreciated by our contacts with charities in Ukraine and Poland. “It ensured hundreds of kids going through tough times had their Christmas brightened by the generosity of supporters in Scotland. “It shows we haven’t forgotten the plight of the people of Ukraine, who have been battling Putin’s invading forces for nearly two years now.” Kenny stressed that the Errol base is eager to welcome donations of winter clothing, tinned and dried food, tea/coffee, baby food, nappies and sanitary products. “We have had wonderful support since launching in March 2022. “Our 71st lorry load of aid left Errol Airfield earlier in the month and the next is scheduled to leave around January 12. “Sadly, the conflict shows no sign of ending so our help is needed as much as ever.” • See the TASH4Ukraine website for full information.",
