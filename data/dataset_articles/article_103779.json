It has risen about 14% so far this year, heading for its biggest annual gain since 2020. US gold futures fell 0.1% to $2,081.10 an ounce.\n“Gold prices seem to end the year near current levels, while the main driver next year would be the timing and depth of Fed interest rate cuts,” said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.\nBets for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve firmed in the wake of cooler inflation data, with traders now pricing in an 88% chance of monetary policy easing in March, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\nLower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding gold.\nThe dollar index fell 0.1% on Friday and was poised for its worst annual in three years, boosting gold’s appeal for other currency holders. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes languished near their lowest level since July at 3.8530%.\n“Refinancing risk is a potent threat to financial stability. If that shakes credit markets and forces the Fed to ramp up stimulus in a hurry, gold will accelerate higher,” said Spivak.\nSpot silver fell 0.4% to $23.83 an ounce, but looked set to the end the year largely flat.\nPlatinum rose 0.1% to $1,003.58 per ounce. Palladium fell 0.8% to $1,123.75. Both autocatalytic metals were on track to have fallen 37% over the year, its biggest drop since 2008.\nNext Article Support our award-winning journalism.
