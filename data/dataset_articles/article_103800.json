  "text": "Major General Christian Frojding, heading the special staff on Ukraine at the Ministry of Defense of the Federal Republic of Germany, spoke about the cooperation between Germany and Ukraine in the field of military training. According to him, over 10,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) have successfully undergone training in Germany since the start of the program. “Since the beginning of our training in Germany alone, more than 10,000 Ukrainian military personnel have completed it,” emphasized General Frojding in an interview with [Süddeutsche Zeitung]. He also added that on January 4, 2024, the preparation of two additional infantry battalions would commence. The European Union Training Mission for the Preparation of Ukrainian Forces (EUMAM), established in October 2022, is engaged not only in training but also in arming Ukrainian forces. The mission, located in Poland and Germany, plans to continue its work in the next two years. In addition, representatives from not only EU member states but also from other non-EU countries participate in the operational headquarters of the mission in Brussels, within the building of the European External Action Service.",
