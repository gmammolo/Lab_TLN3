  "text": "New Delhi: The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) Friday signed a peace accord with the central and Assam governments agreeing to shun violence and join the mainstream.\nThe agreement, signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, came after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government, officials said.\nThe peace pact is expected to end decades old insurgency in Assam.\nHowever, the hardline faction of the ULFA headed by Paresh Baruah is not part of the agreement. Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border.\nThe ULFA was formed in 1979 with the demand for a “sovereign Assam”. Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990.\nThe Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between it and central and state governments.\nPTI\n ",
