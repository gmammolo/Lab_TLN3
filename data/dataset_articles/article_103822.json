  "text": "NEW DELHI: The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and Assam governments on Friday, committing to abandon violence and integrate into mainstream society. Signed in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the peace accord marks the conclusion of 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government. This significant peace pact is anticipated to bring an end to the long-standing insurgency in Assam. 106362098Making the announcement, Shah said, \\\"It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam. For a long time, Assam, Northeast faced violence and after PM Modi became PM in 2014, efforts were made to reduce the gap between Delhi and Northeast.\\\"\\\"This is a new start of a period of peace for the whole Northeast, especially Assam. I want to assure ULFA representatives that the faith you have kept in Govt of India, from the side of Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA), a programme will be made in a time-bound manner to fulfill everything, without you asking for it. Under MHA, a committee will be formed, which will work with the Assam govt to fullfill this agreement,\\\" he added. \\\"As part of the memorandum of settlement signed by Ulfa with Centre & Assam govt, its cadres will give up arms & all forms of violence, disband the outfit, vacate their camps and join the democratic process.\\\"— AmitShah (@AmitShah) Notably, the hardline faction of the ULFA, led by Paresh Baruah and believed to be residing along the China-Myanmar border, did not participate in the agreement. Established in 1979 with the quest for a 'sovereign Assam,' the ULFA has been engaged in subversive activities, leading to its designation as a banned outfit by the central government in 1990. Assam CM said, \\\"Today is a historic day for Assam. During PM Modi's tenure, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, work for Assam's peace was always underway. Three accords have been signed and with three accords tribal militancy has come to an end in Assam.\\\"— CMOfficeAssam (@CMOfficeAssam) The Rajkhowa faction, with a current strength of 553 leaders and cadres, had joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after signing an agreement for suspension of operations with the Centre and Assam government. Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah, however, declined to be part of the negotiations and broke away from the Rajkhowa-led faction in 2012.",
