  "text": "The United Liberation Front of Assam ( ULFA )'s pro-talks faction on Friday signed a tripartite Memorandum of Settlement pact with the Centre and the Assam government on Friday. The peace deal was inked by a 29-member delegation in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, The 29-member delegation of the ULFA 's pro-talks delegation, included 16 ULFA members and 13 from civil society. Speaking on the peace deal, Amit Shah said it is a bright day for the future of Assam. “It is a matter of joy for me that today is a bright day for the future of Assam . For a long time, Assam, Northeast faced violence and after PM Modi became PM in 2014, efforts were made to reduce the gap between Delhi and Northeast…” said Shah. \"Assam has suffered for long due to the violence of the ULFA and 10,000 people lost their lives in this violence since 1979,\" he said. Shah also added that a big development package will be given to Assam as part of the accord. \"Every clause of the pact will be implemented fully,\" he said. The violence has come down in Assam by 87 per cent, deaths by 90 per cent and kidnappings by 84 per cent, added Shah. While Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said it is a historic day for the state. \"Today is a historic day for Assam. During PM Modi's tenure, under the guidance of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, work for Assam's peace was always underway...three accords have been signed and with three accords tribal militancy has come to an end in Assam,” said Sarma. As an aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh, ULFA was formed in April 1979. It was split into two groups in February 2011. The Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction gave up violence and agreed for peace talks, while the Paresh Baruah-led ULFA-Independent faction is against any talks with the government. A peace accord was reached after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction and the government. The peace pact is expected to end decades-old insurgency in Assam. Baruah, who is against any peace talks, is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border. ULFA was declared a banned outfit in 1990.",
