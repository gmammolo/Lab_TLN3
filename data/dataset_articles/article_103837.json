  "text": "ULFA, once one of Assam’s most dreaded militant groups, signed a peace accord with the Union government on Friday, December 29, in a historic moment for the state. The peace accord was signed with the pro-talk faction of the group, and is a culmination of decade-long efforts. Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma were present at the signing. The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) was born on April 7, 1979. Its primary aim – “restoring Assam’s sovereignty”. Since then, the ULFA has been accused of several attacks. The group, in its entirety, is said to have bases in several countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar. The ULFA faction that signed the peace deal with the Centre is led by Anup Chetia and Aravinda Rajkhowa. “This is a new start of a period of peace for the whole Northeast, especially Assam,” Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on the signing of the peace accord. ALSO READ | Assam-Based Militant Group Signs Peace Accord With Centre It was in 2005 when the Union government first agreed to hold talks with ULFA and discuss its core issues. In 2011, the Rajkhowa-led faction began negotiations with the Centre. The other, militant faction, led by one Paresh Baruah, has been opposed to the talks. He has stayed away from the peace accord and has formed a separate organisation called ULFA (Independent). One of the key demands of the ULFA is the formal acknowledgement of six communities in Assam as Scheduled Tribes, an NDTV report said. The communities the group seeks tribal status for are Moran, Muttock, Tai-Ahom, Koch-Rajbongshi, Sootea and Tea Tribes. Upon signing of the peace deal, Amit Shah said, “I want to assure ULFA representatives that the faith you have kept in Government of India, from the side of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), a programme will be made in a time-bound manner to fulfil everything, without you asking for it. Under MHA, a committee will be formed, which will work with the Assam government to fulfil this agreement.”",
