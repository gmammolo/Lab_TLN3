  "text": "Circle of Toys, a gift-giving platform is asking the British public to regift preloved toys to children and families impacted by war in Ukraine.\nWith Christmas over, families up and down Britain will be thinking about de-cluttering and regifting pre-loved presents which are no longer age-appropriate for their little ones.\nThe platform makes regifting simple. Gift-givers follow a simple sign-up process registering in seconds and can then select from a list of requests posted by Ukrainian gift seekers. Once a gift has been matched and details exchanged, the gift is mailed by the giver’s expense.\nFamilies in Ukraine traditionally exchange gifts on New Year’s Eve rather than Christmas Day, as New Year occurs before Orthodox Christmas – January 7th – however many families have this year switched their celebrations to\n25 December to align with Western traditions following the invasion by Russia.\nArthur Corvin Powells, CEO at\nhttps://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fcircleoftoys.online%2Fen/2/0102018cb48c3fd5-b5f795df-a3f2-4c38-b95e-9857e6e2466b-000000/tpt4KhpQgGYR_o84V3av2iuWjqc=354, said: “We have thousands of children in Ukraine who would just love to receive a special gift from somebody in Britain. Every year kids and parents decide to part with some of their pre-loved toys to de-clutter or to move things on. If a small fraction of these were directed to kids in Ukraine, they would make a massive impression and bring new happiness at a time of real need.”\nThe Circle of Toys project is run by\nFind Refuge, and is a platform that unites those in need with people who can help across the world by using technology to connect gift-givers with families less fortunate in Ukraine. It currently has more than 20,000 Ukrainian-based gift seekers signed up to its website, with the number continuing to grow in the run-up to the festive holiday\nTo find out more about the Circle of Toys project and how you can sign up to be a gift giver ahead of Christmas, visit:\nhttps://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fcircleoftoys.online%2Fen/3/0102018cb48c3fd5-b5f795df-a3f2-4c38-b95e-9857e6e2466b-000000/yLTUqeX1mddl4MDbzXsM8FGuHq4=354",
