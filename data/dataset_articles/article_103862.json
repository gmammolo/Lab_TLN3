Dr Abiy Ali Ahmed and Getachew Reda, Head of the Interim Regional Administration of Tigray, for their continued commitment to implement the COHA within the spirit of African solutions to African problems.\nThe Chairperson equally expresses gratitude to all Ethiopian, regional and international actors for their continued steadfast support to the AU-led peace process for northern Ethiopia. The Chairperson calls specifically on bilateral and multilateral partners to concretely offer support to the AU-led process towards the implementation of the COHA.\n43417-pr-AUC_Chairperson_Statement_Grant_Agreement_Ethiopia.28.12.23.pdf Press release-en Political (PAPS) Images Share: Discover Menu: DP PAPS Political Home\nAreas of Work Political Affairs Peace and Security Contacts Department Resources Key Documents Factsheets Speeches All Documents Documents The 6th Annual Continental Forum Of Election Management Bodies | Enhancing Participation Of And Refugees In Elections In Africa Towards More Inclusive Electoral Processes January 30, 2023 Documents Summary report First Senior Regional Course for the Prevention of Violent Extremism (PVE) for West Africa Region July 07, 2022 Documents Revue Africaine sur le Terrorisme | Volume 11 .
