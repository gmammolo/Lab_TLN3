  "text": "HALIFAX, N.S. — Carter Bickle of the Charlottetown Islanders and the Halifax Mooseheads’ Jack Milner engaged in an old-fashioned goaltending duel as the Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) resumed play after the Christmas break on Dec. 28.\nBickle stopped 33 of 34 shots through regulation time and a five-minute overtime period and then denied the Mooseheads on all three attempts in the shootout as Charlottetown pulled out a 2-1 road win before 9,215 fans at Scotiabank Centre in Halifax.\nMilner turned aside 31 of 32 shots and two of three Charlottetown attempts in the shootout. Alexis Michaud scored on the Islanders’ first shot of the shootout, and that proved to be the difference.\nSimon Hughes of Stratford, P.E.I., scored his sixth goal of the season at 7:09 of the second period to pull the Islanders into a 1-1 tie. Mathew Butler earned the lone assist on the power-play goal.\nMarkus Vidicek, assisted by Dylan MacKinnon and Mathieu Cataford, opened the scoring for the Mooseheads at 19:41 of the first period.\nOnly three minor penalties were called in the fast-paced game. The Islanders were 1-for-2 on the power play, and Halifax went 0-for-1.\nThe victory improved the Islanders’ record to 15-17-1-1 while the Mooseheads fell to 22-9-4-1. The Mooseheads were missing the team’s No. 1 goaltender, Mathis Rousseau, forward Jordan Dumais (31 points in 21 games) and defenceman and captain Jake Furlong (20 points in 29 games), who are playing with Team Canada at the world junior hockey championship in Sweden.\nThe game’s three stars were: 1. Bickle (Islanders), 2. Jack Milner (Mooseheads), 3. Michaud (Islanders).\nThe Islanders are back on home ice at Eastlink Centre in Charlottetown against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan (15-17-1-2) on Dec. 29 at 7 p.m.",
