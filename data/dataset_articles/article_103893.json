  "text": "In a letter sent today to the Cuban embassy in Cairo, CEFA president Kamal Gaballa reiterated the organization’s full support to the defense of the achievements attained by that Caribbean island since January 1, 1959.\nHe also highlighted the firmness of Cuban society in its struggle against foreign conspiracies, especially “the hostile policies pursued by the government of the United States”.\nIn this regard, he criticized the measures implemented to strangle the economy of that nation and “the intensification of an unjust financial, commercial and economic blockade that has been in place for more than six decades”.\nWe also denounce the miserable political and media campaigns against Cuba, in an attempt to create a state of internal unrest, the text underlined.\nThe CEFA, in turn, thanked “the noble positions of solidarity of the friendly Republic of Cuba with the legitimate Arab issues, at the core of which is the Palestinian cause”.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to continue all efforts to promote brotherly, friendly and cooperative relations between Egypt and Cuba at all levels in order to realize the hopes of the two friendly peoples, it concluded.\njrr/mem/rob",
