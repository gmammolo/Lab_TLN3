  "text": "Denmark, home to some of the world’s major shipping firms, has approved a significant wage increase for crews navigating through the Red Sea due to heightened security risks from recent attacks. The decision, announced on Friday by employer group Danish Shipping and the nation’s three largest labor unions for seafarers, entails doubling wages for the time spent in two specified high-risk zones in the region. The move responds to the escalating danger posed by attacks in the Red Sea, particularly by Yemen-based Houthis supporting Hamas in the Israel conflict. Even vessels without direct ties to Israel have been targeted. As the war’s escalation threatens global trade, a US-led task force is working to enhance security in the crucial waterway. Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S, the world’s second-largest container line, is among the companies gearing up to resume shipping through the Red Sea, opting for this route after initially navigating south of Africa. In contrast, some companies, such as shipping giant Hapag-Lloyd AG, remain cautious, confirming their continued avoidance of the Red Sea and planning a review on Jan. 2. Recent data indicates that half of the container-ship fleet regularly transiting the Red Sea and Suez Canal is diverting from the route. Choosing the longer route around Africa can result in up to a 25% increase in travel time compared to the Suez Canal shortcut between Asia and Europe, potentially leading to higher costs that may be passed on to consumers. This situation unfolds concurrently with the Panama Canal facing challenges due to drought, adding to potential economic risks.",
