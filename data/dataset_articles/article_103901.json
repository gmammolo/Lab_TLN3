  "text": "Welcome two new faces to enlisted leadership in 2024.\nDavid Flosi, the next chief master sergeant of the Air Force, and Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force John Bentivegna, who started the job in September, will be the top advocates for more than 261,000 enlisted airmen and guardians — the Department of the Air Force’s largest constituency — as well as key advisers to each service’s four-star boss.\nFlosi (pronounced “floss-ee”) most recently served as the top enlisted airman at Air Force Materiel Command. His selection signals that Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin values his input as a career munitions expert, including a background in nuclear missile maintenance, as the service brings on a new generation of nuclear weapons.\nBentivegna previously worked as the senior enlisted adviser to the Space Force’s chief operations officer. In that role, he oversaw the noncommissioned guardians who help fly military satellites, operate offensive and defensive weapons in orbit and track missile launches around the globe.\nTogether, they’ll look to shape the future of enlisted education, redefine the enlisted corps’ role in an evolving force and push for policies that keep military families happy and healthy.\nFlosi will also oversee the Air Force’s ongoing effort to reshape the enlisted enterprise by growing the lower ranks and slowing promotions to midlevel jobs — a plan that has frustrated many airmen eager to climb the career ladder and earn more money.\nTroops hope the men will seek meaningful change on issues from unit understaffing to dysfunctional computers and IT networks to — of course — beards.\nRachel Cohen is the editor of Air Force Times. She joined the publication as its senior reporter in March 2021. Her work has appeared in the Washington Post, the Frederick News-Post (Md.), Air and Space Forces Magazine, Inside Defense, Inside Health Policy and elsewhere.",
