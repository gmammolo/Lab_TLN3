  "text": "Bedford County designated as World War II Heritage City BEDFORD COUNTY, Va. (WDBJ) - The U.S. Department of Interior’s National Park Service (NPS) has designated Bedford County as a World War II Heritage City. U.S. Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) [wrote a letter to the National Park Service in September](https://www.wdbj7.com/2023/09/06/kaine-asks-national-park-service-give-wwii-heritage-city-status-bedford-county/) requesting that the county be given the designation. “World War II was a defining period in American history, and Bedford County has been a vocal advocate for memorializing and preserving this history. As the site of the National D-Day Memorial and the homeplace of the Bedford Boys, this decision by NPS introduces the rest of the country to a foundational piece of World War II preservation efforts. I am proud to represent Virginia’s only World War II Heritage City and I applaud the years of hard work by Bedford County and others to make this designation possible,” said Congressman Morgan Griffith (R-VA). Bedford County is one of 11 new U.S. communities to receive the distinction. Copyright 2023 WDBJ. All rights reserved.",
