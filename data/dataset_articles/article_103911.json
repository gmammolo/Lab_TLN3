  "text": "MPOS adopts anti-conflict measures ‘We recognize the pressing need to confront family feuds, reduce the proliferation of loose firearms, dissolve private armed groups, eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs, and combat all forms of criminal activities.’ ZAMBOANGA CITY — The Ministry of Public Order and Safety recently spearheaded efforts to enhance its mechanisms in preventing the occurrence of violent conflicts in the region. MPOS kicked off the initiative during the 4th Bangsamoro Public Order and Safety Conference with the theme “Consolidating the Gains of Building an Enduring Peace” at Koronadal City from 20 to 21 December 2023. MPOS Minister Hussein Muñoz narrated that the event sought to establish and further strengthen coordination and collaboration mechanisms with different law enforcement agencies, and civil society organizations, among others operating in the region. Muñoz believed that to attain peace, it must be acknowledged that an enduring solution lies not only in dismantling structures of violence but also in addressing the root causes that breed social unrest. “We recognize the pressing need to confront family feuds, reduce the proliferation of loose firearms, dissolve private armed groups, eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs, and combat all forms of criminal activities,” Muñoz said. The military — through Maj. Oliver dela Cruz of the 6th Infantry Division stationed in Maguindanao del Norte — expressed the soldiers’ commitment to support the measure.
