  "text": "I wish you health, fellow Ukrainians!\nAvdiivka. Our positions. Our guys. Ukraine is defending its own here. Defending our entire nation. Just as on the entire front line. Donetsk region. Kharkiv region. Zaporizhzhia. Kherson region – the left bank. It is hard. It is pain and losses. And these are the people who keep Ukraine alive. Life is being fought for here. And we are grateful to every warrior. To every soldier, sailor, sergeant and officer bearing this war on their shoulders. Thank you all, warriors!\nToday in Avdiivka, together with the team, we extended Christmas and New Year greetings to the military. All those who are on the front line. Those who are defending our country. Immense gratitude to all the relatives, to every family of our heroes. And to everyone who helps. Those who work to ensure that our guys at the front have what they need. And to everyone in the world who believes in us and does everything to make Ukraine more powerful.\nWe remember what is at stake in this war. We are defending our country.\nGlory to Ukraine!",
