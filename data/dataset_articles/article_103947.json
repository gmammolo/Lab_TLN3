  "text": "It’s been quite a couple of weeks for Cleveland Browns quarterback Joe Flacco.\nOut of football until Nov. 20, when he was signed to the Browns practice squad after Deshaun Watson was lost for the season with a shoulder injury, all Flacco has done is start five games, go 4-1, lead Cleveland to the playoffs and become the first player in NFL history to have 250 passing yards and multiple touchdowns in each of his first five games with a new franchise.\nFlacco’s NFL Comeback Player of the Year odds have also seen a miraculous rise. Originally off the board at the start of the season, Flacco appeared as high as 250-1 to win the award at DraftKings Sportsbook three weeks ago, before rising all the way to +400 (second-best odds) before Thursday night’s game against the New York Jets.\nAfter his performance, Flacco rose all the way to +100 with Damar Hamlin — the favorite — at -150 at DraftKings. Baker Mayfield has the next-best odds at 10-1, followed by Tua Tagovailoa at 20-1.\nHeading into Thursday Night Football , only 4.2 percent of tickets (ninth most) and 2.8 percent of the total dollars wagered in the NFL Comeback Player of the Year market at BetMGM were on Flacco. Over half of the handle was on Hamlin to win the award at BetMGM.\nCan Flacco pull off the improbable?\nMuch like the ever-changing NFL MVP race, it will be an interesting betting market to monitor down the stretch.\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.
