  "text": "Ralph Goncalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said he was optimistic about the dialogue between Venezuela and Guyana on the Essequibo territory, despite the warship sent from Great Britain to the former English colony to provide “diplomatic and military support” and who is supposed to participate in joint exercises after Christmas, the BBC noted at the time. Goncalves, who leads the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) and is the main interlocutor between Venezuela and Guyana, stated that \"what I hope is that fewer events occur that could lead to an interpretation of provocation or threat,\" pointing to the arrival of warship HMS Trent and added that both countries “have sufficient maturity to continue dialogue and the search for peace.” On December 24, England announced the shipment of the ship to Guyana after advance statements by its officials about Guyana's alleged ownership of the Essequibo, when there are historical documents that show the English recognizing that territory as Venezuela's. These events have been accompanied by actions by the US Southern Command with broad displays of support for the exploitation of the wealth in Guyana Esequiba by US companies, to the point that the costs of Guyana's legal representation are paid by Exxon Mobil. .",
