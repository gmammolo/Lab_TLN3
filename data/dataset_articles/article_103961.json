  "text": "Ian Mune\nKnight companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to film , television and theatre .\nAsked how it feels to be made a knight companion of the NZ Order of Merit, Ian Mune bursts into a booming laugh.\n“If it’s used on formal occasions, that’ll be fine - I just don’t want my kids calling me Sir Dad,” he jokes.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. At 82, the acting great has countless accolades to his name, from an OBE to multiple awards and Television Legend status, but he doesn’t want to get “too carried away with the formalities”.\nAt the time of writing, Mune hadn’t yet told his family the news but knew exactly what their reaction would be.\n“Some of them will have to work out what it all means,” he tells the Herald . “But the kids will be thinking what I’m thinking - which is that I wish my wife was here.”\nHe has a chuckle as he realises “she would be Lady Jo”.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. Mune, who lost his beloved wife Josie eight years ago , reveals he “gave up making movies” after her death and found solace in art.\n“So I picked up the paint brushes and I’ve been painting pretty much full time ever since,” he says, adding that what he loves about painting is that “nobody can tell me I’m doing it wrong”.\n“They can say they don’t like it, but it’s something you do on your own. All the other work I’ve done - acting, writing, directing - everything’s a team effort.”\nHe’s hesitant to say he’s proud of his acting work, preferring to “think about it in terms of what I enjoy most”.",
