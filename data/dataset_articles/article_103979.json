  "text": "Watch Now: Brown (back) is questionable for Friday's game against the Raptors, Taylor Snow of the Celtics ' official site reports.\nBrown missed Thursday's game against the Pistons due to a low back contusion, and it's unclear whether he'll be able to suit up for the second half of the back-to-back set. With Al Horford (rest) out and Kristaps Porzingis (calf) doubtful, Sam Hauser and Neemias Queta should see additional minutes Friday, especially if Brown is unavailable.\nMore News Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Officially ruled out 1D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Iffy against Detroit 2D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Shakes off back issue, scores 19 3D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Starts second half 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Heads to locker room 4D ago • by RotoWire Staff Celtics' Jaylen Brown: Strikes for 24 in big win 6D ago • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Basketball Stories December rookie report: Chet, Victor, more Alex Barutha • 6 min read Christmas Day slate games, more Steve Alexander • 7 min read Waiver Wire: Week 10 Alex Rikleen • 6 min read Week 9 pulse check: Who's hot, who's not Alex Barutha • 7 min read Week 9 starts/sits: Top NBA fantasy plays Adam King • 4 min read Waiver Wire: Week 9 Alex Rikleen • 7 min read",
