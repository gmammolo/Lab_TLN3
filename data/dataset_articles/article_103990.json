  "text": "Shield AI, a San Diego, CA-based defense technology company, raised additional $100M in Series F funding, and $200M in debt from Hercules Capital.\nThe company intends to use the funds to accelerate deployment of AI pilots to different classes of aircraft.\nFounded in 2015 and led by CEO Ryan Tseng, Shield AI is a defense technology company whose mission is to protect service members and civilians with intelligent systems. Its flagship product, Hivemind, is an AI pilot that enables teams of intelligent aircraft to operate and complete missions autonomously in high-threat environments, without the need for remote operators or GPS. Hivemind is an aircraft agnostic autonomy stack similar to the self-driving technology found in cars. It has flown quadcopters, the MQ-35A V-BAT, and the F-16.\nNext year it will fly Kratos’ XQ-58 Valkyrie. Shield AI has accumulated more autonomous flight hours executing fighter jet maneuvers, like dogfighting, than any company in the world.\nThe company has offices in San Diego, Dallas, Washington, D.C., and abroad.\nFinSMEs\n29/12/2023",
