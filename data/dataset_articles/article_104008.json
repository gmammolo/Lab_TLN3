  "text": "Operation Home for the Holidays Published Dec. 29, 2023 By Senior Airman Evan Lichtenhan 5th Bomb Wing Public Affairs MINOT AIR FORCE BASE, N.D. -- A new program, Operation Home for the Holidays, was recently instituted by U.S. Air Force Col. Daniel Hoadley, 5th Bomb Wing commander, U.S. Air Force Col. Kenneth McGhee, 91st Missile Wing commander, with the city of Minot Chamber of commerce. This program was put in place to raise funds for single Airmen to visit their families during the holiday season free of charge. Airmen were offered the opportunity to visit their families either during Thanksgiving, Christmas or New Year’s Day. The program raised approximately $125,000 and was able to send over 115 Airmen from Minot AFB home for the holidays. Airman 1st Class Bryce Conner, 705th Munitions Squadron nuclear weapons technician, chose to visit his family in Pennsylvania during Christmas and New Year’s Day. “I had to fill out a form with a few questions regarding why it would benefit me, what I was looking forward to the most, and then send it to the First Sergeant,” said Conner. “I am looking forward to seeing my family and my girlfriend who has not moved out here yet.” Airman 1st Class Xavier Patton, 91st Missile Security Forces Squadron missile security operator, is looking forward to going back to Phoenix, Arizona, where he will catch up with his younger sister. “I am excited to get back to the good weather and to see my family. I’m especially looking forward to seeing my little sister,” said Patton. “She just started kindergarten and misses me a lot. She is excited to tell me about what she has been learning in school.” Both Conner and Patton are incredibly thankful for Operation Home for the Holidays, and look forward to seeing their families this holiday season.",
