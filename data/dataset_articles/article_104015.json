  "text": "U.S. Marines from the 1st Battalion, 2d Marine Regiment engage in cold weather training alongside NATO allies against the backdrop of the northern lights in Setermoen, Norway, on Dec. 6, 2023. Equipped with newfound expertise, these Marines will depart with the capability to instruct others on effectively navigating and operating in challenging winter conditions. This training initiative, supported by specialized education, aims to elevate overall knowledge and enhance combat effectiveness in arctic or cold weather environments.
