  "text": "Tech. Sgt. Dylan Jarvis, 365th Training Squadron instructor supervisor, received the Air and Space Commendation Medal for heroism on Jan. 9, 2023, here after preventing a suicide last March.\nJarvis became a hero after he noticed a woman clinging to the edge of a bridge, ran across a four-lane highway and saved her life.\n“There’s not really a thought process. I immediately started sprinting across the four-lane freeway to get to her,” said Jarvis. “She was already over the railing trying to jump into the main highway.”\n“When I got her back over the ledge, we sat down and talked about her life, kids and what was ahead for her future,” said Jarvis. Once I built that rapport, we carefully walked back across the freeway where my wife was speaking with emergency services.”\nJarvis’ selfless actions reflect who he is as a person, but also who he is as an Airman as he supervises and instructs junior enlisted Airmen.\n“I told them I want to be the change in the Air Force,” said Jarvis. “I want to make things better in the Air Force rather than just complain because I care about the people.”\nMaj. John De Laura, 365th TRS Commander, presented the medal for Jarvis' actions.\n|Date Taken:||02.21.2023|\n 14:50|\n|Story ID:||461056|\n|Location:||US|\n|Web Views:||6|\n Sheppard instructor receives Commendation Medal for heroism, by\n[A1C Katie Caroline McKee](/portfolio/1739189/katie-caroline-mckee),\nNo keywords found.",
