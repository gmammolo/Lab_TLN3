  "text": "Western United coach John Aloisi says his team is ready to bounce back against Newcastle.\nBack on their feet after a hard-fought loss to Sydney FC, Western United are determined to notch their first win in four games when they meet Newcastle.\nThe A-League Men strugglers copped a 4-2 beating by the Sky Blues, despite taking the lead in the opening five minutes.\nThe ‘never say die’ United came close to levelling the scores through Michael Ruhs after Matthew Grimaldi pulled one back, only for Ruhs’ effort to be chalked off.\nCoach John Aloisi said his charges had quickly moved on from the disappointing result ahead of the Jets test at McDonald Jones Stadium on Saturday.\n“The response has been good coming into the week,” Aloisi said.\n“Against Sydney, we didn’t get the result we deserved from the performance.\n“There were so many good things that I could see from upstairs.\n“We were starting to get really on top of Sydney, creating great scoring chances, then equalising but it was just offside and still pushing.\n“The boys were disappointed after the game because of the result but they’re ready for this game.”\nHeading into their second meeting with the Jets this season, the bottom-placed United have two worrying runs to snap.\nNot only have they lost their last three matches but United have failed to win their last four away matches.\nNewcastle got the better of the Victorian-based club at United’s home venue in round four, ending a six-game winless streak against them with a 1-0 victory.\nBut the ninth-placed Jets have yet to find the same success at their stadium, losing seven of their last eight home games.\n“It’s going to be a little bit different in Newcastle because they’ll want to push even more for the result at home, but we’re the same,” Aloisi said.\n“We want to win and we’re going to push and do everything possible to get the win.\n“We still know that in certain little moments we’re letting ourselves down, but we’re trying to rectify that.\n“We’re working hard on it. The players are making sure that we try and stop those little moments. We can definitely overcome those little moments.”",
