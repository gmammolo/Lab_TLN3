  "text": "Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams told Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble bluntly that he was “the best bet we have” and that Republicans wanted to work with him to achieve a lasting peace settlement in Northern Ireland.\nThe revelation came as confidential documents released as part of the State Archives revealed fascinating insights into the key figures involved in the Northern Ireland peace process and what they privately thought of each other.\nWhile the unlikely relationship between former IRA commander Martin McGuinness and Democratic Unionist Party founder Dr Ian Paisley in the Northern Ireland Assembly later captured headlines, with the pair nicknamed the Chuckle Brothers for their humorous interactions, newly released documents cast a remarkable light on the personal dynamic between Mr Adams and Mr Trimble.\nThe documents also revealed that while the peace process at times teetered on the brink of collapse amid Sinn Féin and UUP tensions, Mr McGuinness and UUP politicians Reg Empey and Chris McGimpsey formed a secret group to facilitate back-door contacts and exchanges.\nOne senior Irish civil servant who became aware of the secret SF-UUP consultation group warned others not to speak about it or reveal its existence as he was determined to protect the “back-channel” forum for talks between the UUP and Sinn Féin.\nDocuments also revealed that British officials quickly appreciated that the relationship between Mr Adams and Mr Trimble would be critical to the success of the peace process, delivering on thorny issues such as decommissioning.\nSeveral weeks before the Good Friday Agreement was ratified, one British official noted that the improving chemistry between the republican and unionist leaders was crucial to success.\nWhitehall official Quentin Thomas noted to one Department of Foreign Affairs official that Mr Adams and Mr Trimble were edging towards a position of being able to work together.\n“It should be noted the importance of the personal chemistry between Trimble and Adams,” said the Foreign Affairs official. “He believed they are edging gradually towards mutual respect.”\nFor his part, the republican leader was increasingly fulsome, at least to Irish and British officials, about the role being played by his UUP counterpart.\nIn one aside, the Sinn Féin leader had said: “Trimble is playing a blinder.”\nSeveral unionist sources admitted to Irish and British officials that the UUP leader was intrigued by Mr Adams and was slowly coming to the belief that the Sinn Féin leader was committed to the peace process.\nUS senator George Mitchell was assigned to help steer through various elements of the Northern Ireland peace deal.\nIn September 1999, he was astonished as both the Sinn Féin leader and the UUP leaders engaged in a heated row.\nLater, Mr Mitchell noted that the exchanges involved were marked by “a ferocity” and that the meeting was mired by mutual recriminations, high emotions and proved very difficult.\nBoth party leaders continued to meet in private, though this did not prevent ferocious rows in public or during talks sessions. At one point, the UUP leader told Mr Adams: “I want a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. I want total disarmament.”\nIn a remark that brought silence to the room, the Sinn Féin leader said if he could he would bring some rifles into the room as a gesture.\n“It would make my life much easier … but it was simply not reality,” he said.\nLater, when Mr Trimble was visibly furious over the stance taken by republicans, Mr Adams turned to him and said the UUP leader was someone his party wanted to work with to achieve peace.\n“You are the best bet we have – we want to work with you,” he said.\nSlightly mollified, it was noted that Mr Trimble then replied that unionists needed specific things to change, such as movement on decommissioning.\nMr Mitchell also noted moments of black humour during the talks.\nMr Trimble once quoted Oliver Cromwell as the talks remained mired without progress. Immediately, Mr McGuinness said Cromwell was not a person to be quoting to Irish leaders.\nGet ahead of the day with the morning headlines at 7.30am and Fionnán Sheahan’s exclusive take on the day’s news every afternoon, with our free daily newsletter.",
