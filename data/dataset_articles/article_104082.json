  "text": "RESTON, Va. (7News) — Life is unpredictable - but one Northern Virginia couple found out that unexpected events can lead to the best memories. Nearly a month before his due date, Kahil and Keiko Britt’s son was struggling to grow. “When I went to see my doctor, I found out that he needed to be delivered as soon as possible,” Keiko told 7News Health and Wellness Reporter Victoria Sanchez. “He came out so little. He was 4lbs. 1oz. I was very scared,” said Kahil. After six days in the Reston Hospital Center’s neonatal intensive care unit, little Kwame was able to his family's South Riding, Virginia home. Kwame’s parents started dating in 2019 - Keiko is from Atlanta and has a son from a previous relationship, she was clear early on with Kahil when their long-distance relationship started. “She don’t really want to do the dating thing, and for me to be in the mindset that if we’re going to be in this relationship, it’s going to be about marriage,” Kahil explained. Soon after their 2022 engagement, the couple found out they were expecting and scheduled the wedding before the baby’s arrival. “And we were just going to do a court wedding,” said Keiko. But the emergency induction scrapped the ceremony. “I approached my manager and said, ‘We need to do something for them,’” said Reston Hospital Center Registered Nurse Danielle Viates. Viates knew the couple wanted to be married as soon as possible. “Basically, my RN was my wedding planner,” Keiko said with a smile. With help from other nurses and staff, a cake, flowers, and sparkling cider were delivered and the hospital chaplain called in. “Everybody was just so excited. Everybody was so excited to be part of that moment,” said Kahil. Just hours before their son was born, the couple exchanged vows and said “I do.” What a story to tell little Kwame and big brother MJ. One wedding and a birthday all wrapped up into one. “Truly show my sons, how it is for a man to love a woman and to have a wonderful relationship and bond. I’m just trying to teach my sons right,” Kahil told Sanchez. “That’s why we decided to have our wedding at Reston Hospital,” added Keiko.",
