  "text": "Federal authorities have sent an Iranian national with “ties to terrorism” back to Canada more than two months after he had tried to unlawfully cross the border on two separate occasions. The unnamed individual – who was sought by Canadian authorities on assault charges – was officially removed on Dec. 21 by Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Buffalo, US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. The man was wanted by Canadian authorities as a “national security priority” and had unspecified “ties to terrorism,” the statement added. The fugitive first tried to enter the US on Oct. 10, when he presented himself to immigration authorities at the Rainbow Pedestrian Walkway in Niagara Falls, ICE explained. He was refused by Customs and Border Protection officers and escorted to the Canadian Border Services. Two days later, however, US Border Patrol arrested him when he unlawfully entered the US “on or around” the Whirlpool Bridge Port of Entry in Niagara Falls, the statement continued. The Iranian national was served an expedited removal order by ERO Buffalo on Nov. 8. He remained in the US for six weeks, until he was removed to Canada under the Safe Third Country Act, ICE explained. “The strong law enforcement partnership between ERO Buffalo and Canadian law enforcement authorities is imperative to increasing national security and preventing dangerous individuals from fleeing justice,” said ERO Buffalo Field Office Director Thomas Brophy said in the statement. “The Canadian resident’s return to Canada to face charges is due to the dedicated officers on both sides of the border, working in tandem, to provide public safety for our communities,” he added. In 2023, authorities encountered 564 individuals whose names appeared on the terror watchlist at the northern and southern borders, according to Customs and Border Patrol data . Of those, 172 successfully crossed illegally into the US.",
