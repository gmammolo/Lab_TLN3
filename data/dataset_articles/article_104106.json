  "title": "Alan Sheehan hails Swansea’s fighting spirit after late draw at Coventry – The Irish News",
  "text": "Swansea interim head coach Alan Sheehan was proud of his side after Liam Cullen’s last-gasp free-kick earned a 2-2 draw at Coventry. Liam Walsh had put Swansea ahead in the seventh minute before they were pegged back by Haji Wright. Ellis Simms then fired the Sky Blues in front before Cullen’s superb free-kick in the third minute of added time. The point came after the Swans had been hammered 5-0 by former head coach Russell Martin and Southampton on Boxing Day. Sheehan said: “We had to hang in there at times but how we finished the last 10-15 minutes I really liked and I think we deserved a point. “They just kept on fighting and that’s the proudest thing I can say about them. “We wanted a response, a lot of things have gone against us in the last couple of days in terms of the result, sickness running through the camp with a lot of lads up all night sick. “The manner of the goals conceded is incredibly disappointing but for large amounts of the first half I saw a team that I really like watching. “We just wanted a reaction, to draw a line under it, show how we get better, can we start building a structure? I thought for large amounts of the first half and as we went into the second you saw a real identity to what we wanted to do today.” Swansea have been without a head coach since Michael Duff was sacked on December 4, as Sheehan took charge of his sixth match. He added: “They’re looking for the right person. Different clubs do it different and they appoint straight away but there’s a lot of people interested in this job. “I think it’s very important the club and board get the right person to drive this club forward. “I’m enjoying it, it’s hard and a really difficult time in terms of travelling and time away from family, a lot of sacrifices but I believe our work has been meticulous and we at least deserved a point for that.” Despite the last-gasp equaliser, which prevented Coventry from making it three straight wins, manager Mark Robins claimed that it was a point gained for the Sky Blues. “You don’t gain anything until the final whistle, so we’ve gained a point,” said Robins. “The goal was poor, the wall was not set quite right, there was too much of a gap there and he just played it through it. “We’ve played pretty well, at times we’ve had some good moves, created good chances, took some really good chances and then just maybe a little bit more concentration sees us through. “We didn’t have enough control in the game for the last five minutes or so, there were times in the game where we did and we started to get on top and we got our noses in front. “We conceded the goal early on but the reply was really quick, a really incisive move and a really good finish from Haji. “The second half was too open but then the changes that I made had an impact. “We’re disappointed that we’ve conceded that goal. Firstly the free-kick in the first place and then letting them have the gap to hit the corner. “It was a consequence of the weight of the pressure because we didn’t get hold of the ball in the front area which allowed them to keep picking it up and keep coming at us, so that’s frustrating. “They’ve worked really hard, the third game in a really short space of time and we were a couple of minutes away from three points.”",
