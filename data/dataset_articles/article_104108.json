  "text": "Lecturer and Counter Terrorism Campaigner receives OBE in New Year Honours University of Salford Lecturer Travis Frain has been appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King Charles in his New Year Honours List. Travis, 25 from Darwen, is a Counter Terrorism campaigner and survived serious injuries sustained in the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March 2017. After months of recuperation Travis decided to commit the rest of his life to working to help prevent future attacks, and supporting anyone who might be caught up in terrorist events. Since 2017, Travis has delivered Counter Terrorism training workshops to over 100,000 young people in schools, colleges and community centres around the UK. In 2021, he founded the [ Resilience in Unity Project](https://www.resilienceinunity.com) with a mission to counter radicalisation by empowering the voices of survivors of terrorism from around the world, bringing them together to foster resilience. In August 2023 Travis was appointed to his job at University of Salford where he teaches counter terrorism and investigation skills to trainee Police Officers joining Greater Manchester Police. Travis also works with Counter Terrorism Policing HQ (SO15) at New Scotland Yard in London as an Advisor, Ambassador, and formerly the National Chair of their Youth Advisory Network. Commenting on the award, Travis said: “To be appointed an OBE by His Majesty The King is undoubtedly the honour of a lifetime. I am immensely humbled that people felt my work was worthy of recognition, and I only hope that this will shine a light on the terrific work being conducted by thousands of likeminded individuals up and down the country to try and counter the spread of violent extremism, and prevent further terrorist attacks.” The citation issued by Buckingham Palace also recognises the work Travis has done to advocate and campaign for improvements in the support services provided to victims of terrorism. Travis works with several organisations to enhance outcomes for victims, including the National Emergencies Trust and Rapaid. “I suspect this honour is likely a recognition of the countless late nights I’ve spent chipping away behind the scenes and trying to lobby Government for change. The simple fact is that the state can, and should, be doing so much more to support victims of terrorism, and I only hope that with this award, I’m able to continue driving home that message until we get the change that is needed.” For all press office enquiries please email [communications@salford.ac.uk](mailto:communications@salford.ac.uk).
