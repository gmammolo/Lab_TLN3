  "text": "At such a difficult time for the country, his success is a trickle of good news. He knows the difficulty those still there face. He thinks about it every day.“Everything is normal,” he says with a deep sigh and a proclivity for understatement. “As good as it can be.”\nHis parents didn’t know he had made it to the NBA until he snapped a picture of his new No. 14 jersey in his new locker before the game and sent it to them back home in Cherkasy. He wanted it to be a surprise. Skapintsev is just the 10th player to be born in Ukraine and make it to the NBA.\nRumor Hype Rumor visits per day for the last week\nViews per day\nDecember 29, 2023 | 6:45 pm EST Update\nKeith Pompey: #Sixers reserve forward\nKJ Martin (illness) will be available to play tonightvs. the Houston Rockets.\nTim MacMahon:\nKyrie Irving, who has been out three weeks with a right heel contusion, has been upgraded to doubtfulvs. Warriors tomorrow. Luka Doncic (quad) is listed as questionable after sitting out last night. Aaron Gordon remains away from the Nuggets while he recovers from a dog bite on Christmas that left him with lacerations to his face and hand, but Reggie Jackson says he’s been staying in contact with his teammate.“I talked to my guy a little bit,” Jackson told DNVR on Thursday. “He’s still in high spirits.” “Aaron’s still concerned about the team. He wants to be back with the group, but we just want what’s best for him.”\nWhen asked by DNVR if Gordon has given any inkling of when he’ll return to the Nuggets’ lineup, Jackson said the team isn’t thinking about that. “It’s not about that,” Jackson told DNVR. “Whenever he’s ready we’re going to welcome him back with open arms.”\n“We want him to be mentally and physically good,” Jackson continued. “We definitely miss him. I miss talking to him.”\nDecember 29, 2023 | 6:24 pm EST Update\n<a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/rumor/jayson-tatum-kristaps-porzingis-wont-play-against-toronto/\">\nJayson Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis won't play against Toronto </a>\nBobby Manning:\nKristaps Porzingis and Jayson Tatum are out tonight.Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown will play.\nJonathan Feigen:\nIme Udoka said Dillon Brooks and Jabari Smith could be back within a week or sobut could not yet be more specific.
