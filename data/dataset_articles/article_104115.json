In a short statement on his official website and his X (Twitter) account, President Zelensky wrote: \"I have just spoken with His Holiness Pope Francis to express gratitude for his Christmas greetings to Ukraine and Ukrainians, for his wishes of peace - just peace for all of us,\" said President Zelensky. \"We discussed our joint work on the Peace Formula - more than 80 states are already involved at the level of their representatives. There will be more. I am grateful to the Vatican for supporting our work.\" Pope Francis received the Ukrainian President in the Vatican for the first time in 2020, before the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. On 13 May this year, they met in person again. They have also spoken by phone several times. In their first phone call on 26 February 2022, just two days after the outbreak of the war.
