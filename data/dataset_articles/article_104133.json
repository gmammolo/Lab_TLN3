  "text": "2023-12-29 22:15:00 Former advisor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) Valery Zaluzhny Alla Martynyuk on the evening of December 29 [spoke out](https://ura.news/news/1052718760) about the death of Ukrainians at the front. She said that soldiers should not be afraid to die, because it is better to die on the battlefield than in some “ridiculous” way. After these words, the commander in chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine [refused](https://ura.news/news/1052718789) from her and stated that he does not have assistant consultants on a voluntary basis. A native of Kyiv, Alla Martynyuk built a singing career in Russia in the 2000s and was the lead singer of the group “Slivki”. URA.RU provides information about who Zaluzhny’s advisor was in the past. How Martynyuk came to Russia Alla Martynyuk was born in Kyiv on March 12, 1984. She graduated from school with a gold medal. Afterwards she studied acting at the Kiev National University of Theatre, Film and Television named after I.K. Karpenko-Kary on the course of E.O. Gulyakina. In 2002, she dropped out of school and went to conquer Moscow. In 2002-2003 she was the lead singer of the popular Russian group Slivki. In the team, she replaced Daria Ermolaeva, who had health problems. In 2003, Ermolaeva returned to the team, and Alla Martynyuk’s performances in the group ended. Since 2006, she began acting in films, making her debut in the Russian action comedy film “Insatiable”. After that, she starred in 14 more films and TV series. Alla lived in Moscow for six years and got married there for the first time. After the divorce she returned to Kyiv. Martynyuk’s attitude to the change of power in Ukraine Alla Martynyuk returned to Kyiv in 2008. In 2014, she supported Maidan and the change of power in Ukraine. Then she became a military volunteer and changed her creative career to traveling with humanitarian aid to the front and refused to work in Russia. In August 2018, she was awarded the honor of the President of Ukraine for her humanitarian participation in the “anti-terrorist operation.” The award was presented to her by the mayor of Kyiv Vitaliy Klitschko. 1703898738 #Zaluzhnys #assistant #Alla #Martynyuk #details",
