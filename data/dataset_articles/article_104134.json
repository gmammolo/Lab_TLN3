  "text": "Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino is embracing the challenge that Luton Town will pose.\nThe newly promoted club are on a run of good results that has seen them close the gap to teams that are out of the relegation zone.\nPochettino, whose Chelsea side won 2-1 against Crystal Palace last time around, knows they face another huge threat.\nHe told reporters: \"Of course. I think that game against Crystal Palace is a good example that we need to go there, to Luton, and to think it is going to be really tough. The stadium, the fans, it is a team that loves to fight, loves to work really, really hard.\n\"It is so difficult if you watch the last few games at their stadium, it's always tough for all of the opponents. If we want to get a good result, we need to be ready to of course play football, but we need to match their desire, the capacity to fight in every single goal. It's going to be a good test for us. It's the challenge to be consistent. For us now, it's to go there and first of all to fight, be clever, be focused and then try to win the game.\"\nPochettino added on Kenilworth Road, Luton's stadium: \"Yes, because I am an old man, I am romantic. I love the football of the past and this type of stadium makes you remember when I start to play, you know, the old Wembley. A stadium that smells different.\n\"They're maybe not luxury in the way that we recognise luxury today but these types of stadiums, I think you love to be there because of its history. They are completely different. Today we are living with a million dollar stadium but if you go there and you feel the real football.\" Video of the day:\nAbout the author Paul Vegas",
