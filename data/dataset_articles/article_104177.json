  "text": "27 December 2023\nby Akhil Kadidal\nThe second MHI (Sikorsky) SH-60L developmental prototype (serial no 8502) conducts a flight test. (ATLA)\nJapan has completed the development of its improved Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) (Sikorsky) SH-60L maritime helicopter.\nDesigned as an improved anti-surface warfare (ASuW) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter, the new SH-60L has an updated engine transmission, an ultra-high-speed datalink, and improved ASW systems, according to the Japan Ministry of Defense (MoD). According to Japan’s Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA), development of the SH-60L was completed on 22 December.\nThe SH-60L developmental programme began in 2015 with a USD63 million ATLA contract for a rotorcraft with “enhanced capacities”. According to ATLA, the requirement to develop a helicopter to replace the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s (JMSDF’s) older SH-60K helicopters was initiated earlier, in Japan fiscal year (FY) 2007. The SH-60L was originally intended to enter serial production in 2022.\nIn September 2022 Janes reported that the MoD had requested JPY60.3 billion (USD423.1 million) to procure six SH-60Ls as part of its 2023 defence budget. Janes assesses that the aircraft will almost certainly be used on the JMSDF’s new Mogami-class frigates.
