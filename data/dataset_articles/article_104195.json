  "text": "News\nBe prepared for higher tasks – COAS tells promoted officers\nThe Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Taoreed Lagbaja has tasted the newly decorated Brigadier Generals to be prepared for higher responsibilities while seeing their elevation as a reward for hard work and diligence.\nLagbaja gave the charge on Friday during the investiture of newly promoted Colonels to the rank of Brigadier Generals at the Army Headquarters Abuja.\nThis is contained in a statement by the Director of Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Friday in Abuja.\nThe COAS said the newly promoted senior officers had worked hard to justify their elevation and suitability for the new rank.\nHe advised them to be above board and remain loyal to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the President and the Nigerian Army.\nLagbaja directed them to do all within the ambit of the law to animate and ensure implementation of his Command’s Philosophy of “transforming the Army into a well-trained, equipped and highly motivated force, towards achieving our constitutional responsibilities within a joint environment”.",
