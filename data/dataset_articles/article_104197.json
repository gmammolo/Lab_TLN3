  "text": "Paul George scored 23 points and Ivica Zubac added 15 points with a season-high 20 rebounds as the Los Angeles Clippers earned a 117-106 victory over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies on Friday in their fourth consecutive game without Kawhi Leonard.\nJames Harden had 16 points and 13 assists, while Russell Westbrook scored 14 points as the Clippers won for the 11th time in their last 13 games. Los Angeles has split the four games without Leonard, who has been out with a left hip contusion.\nAmir Coffey and Norman Powell each scored 13 points for the Clippers. Coffey has started the past four games in Leonard’s place.\nJa Morant had 19 points and 10 assists for the Grizzlies after missing Thursday’s blowout loss at Denver with an illness. Memphis lost for the first time in the five games Morant has played since returning from a 25-game suspension.\nMarcus Smart and Jaren Jackson Jr. each scored 22 points and Desmond Bane added 18 for the Grizzlies, who went 2-2 on a four-game road trip. Santi Aldama scored 12 points after he also missed Thursday’s game with an illness.\nGeorge opened the game by going 1 of 11 from the field before going 5 of 8 in the third quarter for 12 points when the Clippers took control of the game. Los Angeles had led 59-54 at the half after leading by as many as 15 points in the second quarter.\nIn the third quarter, the Clippers outscored the Grizzlies 35-21 to take a 94-75 lead by shooting 50 percent from the field on 26 attempts and grabbing 17 rebounds. Memphis shot 38.1 percent in the third quarter, even with Morant going 4 of 8 from the floor with 10 points.\nMemphis closed within 105-97 with 6:03 remaining after a 3-pointer by Smart before the Clippers regrouped to take a 112-99 lead with 2:16 remaining on two free throws by George.\nHarden finished with his second-most assists in a game since joining the Clippers on Nov. 6 and delivered his sixth double-double with his new team.\nAfter scoring a season-high 10 points on Thursday, the Grizzlies’ John Konchar was out with an illness.\n–Field Level Media",
