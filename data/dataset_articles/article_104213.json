  "text": "The United Kingdom announced this Friday that it will send about 200 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine to strengthen its security after a wave of Russian bombings in several cities in the country. British Defense Minister Grant Shapps also called on the “free world” to “come together and step up efforts to give Ukraine what it needs to win.” Russian President Vladimir Putin “tests Ukrainian security and the determination of the West (…),” Shapps said in a statement. The delivery of the missiles by the United Kingdom, he said, “sends a clear message that, in the face of Russian brutality, the United Kingdom is fully committed to supporting Ukraine.” ASRAAM type missiles are air-launched, but have been adapted to power ground-based anti-aircraft defense systems.

Since the beginning of the year, the United Kingdom has sent Challenger 2 battle tanks, three batteries of AS-90 artillery guns, hundreds of armored vehicles, Storm Shadow cruise missiles and long-range attack drones to the former Soviet republic.

This Friday, Moscow bombed several Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones. At least 18 people were killed and 132 injured in the attacks in Kiev, according to local officials. MHC/GMO/SAG/EG",
