  "text": "China have caused an upset on day two of the United Cup at RAC Arena, winning both singles matches to secure victory over the fifth-seeded Czech Republic. Rising Chinese star Qinwen Zheng toppled world number seven and reigning Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-1 2-6 6-1 in a roller-coaster women’s singles match. It came after her compatriot Zhizhen Zhang had downed Jiri Lehecka 6-7 6-3 6-4 to give China an early advantage in their best-of-three tie. The victory will put the ninth-seeded China in a promising position in Group E ahead of their New Year’s Eve clash with Serbia and superstar Novak Djokovic. Vondrousova was the favourite heading into her clash with 21-year-old Zheng, but it was the latter who ruthlessly dominated the first set. Zheng broke twice and held her own serve in the opening four games, before staving off a break point to go 5-0 up. Vondrousova struggled to get going as she failed to hit a single winner in the opening set, Zheng capitalising on the world number seven’s 11 unforced errors to claim the first set in just 29 minutes. The Czech star stirred in the second set, a reversal of sorts, recovering from losing her serve in the opening game to win the next three games. A Zheng double fault handed Vondrousova the second set, but the world number 15 overcame the setback with a clinical performance in the third set. Cheered on by a predominantly pro-China crowd, an amped-up Zheng broke in the first game of the third set as an erratic Vondrousova faltered, finding the net four times in a single game to hand her opponent a 4-1 lead which she did not relinquish. Earlier, men’s world number 58 Zhang upset Lehecka - ranked 27 spots above him - 6-7 6-3 6-4 in two hours and 20 minutes. Both players had chances to break early in the opening set, with Lehecka taking his in the third game, before saving two break points from Zhang the following game. With Lehekca serving for the first set at 5-4 up, Zhang secured a break to level the scores, but the Czech world number 31 broke back immediately before serving out the opening set. Zhang raced out to a 3-0 lead in the second set, causing plenty of issues for Lehecka and keeping his higher-ranked opponent at bay to send the match to a deciding set. It was the seventh game which proved crucial as Zhang picked up a crucial break to establish a 4-3 lead. Serving for the match at 5-4, Zhang had three match points on offer and while Lehecka saved one, a sumptuous sliced volley on the second ended the Czech’s challenge. All four singles players will be back in action for the mixed-doubles in the afternoon.",
