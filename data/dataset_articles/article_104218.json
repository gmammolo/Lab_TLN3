  "text": "There isn’t a country where winning the Rugby World Cup means more than South Africa. That’s simply because the Springboks are a beloved beacon of hope in a nation collapsing under the weight of three decades of governmental corruption and four decades of apartheid before that.\nSouth Africa is a broken country in many ways, yet it somehow endures, and in some spheres, thrives. But it’s almost always in spite of its leaders and not because of them.\nThe Springboks of the past six years have come to symbolise the promise and potential of Nelson Mandela’s ‘Rainbow Nation’ dream. The Boks are the embodiment of what the entire beautiful, basket case of a country could be if it were served by politicians with the same innovative and courageous leadership, where the collective is far more important than the individual, as the Boks.\nCaptain Siya Kolisi is the kind of leader that comes along once in a generation, if you’re lucky. Kolisi’s genuine warmth, his love for people and his innate empathy, somehow survived and grew through the most difficult of childhoods.\nHe carries those formative years with him at all times. When Kolisi says he is playing for so much more than himself, it’s genuine and undeniable. Very few of us know what it’s like to drink sugar water to quell desperate hunger, or to rely on a cup of rice from a neighbour to make it through another day of relentless struggle.\nDirector of rugby Rassie Erasmus, despite his occasional run-ins with rugby’s lawmakers, is another who rose to his status through the struggles of a humble upbringing and an alcoholic father.\nHis suffering might have been different to Kolisi’s, but it also shaped him into a ferocious fighter, willing to go to the very brink of what many deem respectable, to gain an edge.\nCoach Jacques Nienaber’s upbringing was less fraught, but he also possesses a mentality that demands the pursuit of perfection and a scientists’ mind, to question everything.\nNienaber’s great gift is that he doesn’t simply accept the status quo and try to improve on it. He prefers to re-imagine the question, before finding the answer.\n“From 2018 we thought we had the ability to win the 2023 World Cup. [The Rugby World Cup win in] 2019 was probably something that hopped on along the way, but it is relief for the players, they were good enough to do that,” Nienaber said after the Boks beat the All Blacks 12-11 to claim the 2023 crown in Paris last month.\n“They [the players] are an amazing bunch of guys, they are all warriors and they all love South Africa.\n“This is probably for our fans and for South Africa. I wish I could show you the amount of messages we have received and what is going on in South Africa. We have 62 million people united, opening up communities to allow people to watch, an entrance fee of whatever they wanted to donate.\n“People have bought green T-shirts for everyone. We felt every single bit of energy they gave us and in the last three games, all one-point victories, that drove us.”\nThese three men, whose careers have intertwined for decades, created the environment that led the Boks to their fourth Webb Ellis Cup in France on 28 October.\nHOPE.\nIf there is any doubt what it meant to the country, search the clips of the Boks’ week-long victory parades through the tough streets of South Africa’s cities. Witness the joy, and hear the voices of regular people, buckling under pressure in a society hanging on by a thread, being given some renewed hope because of what talented, hard-working squad did in France.\n“There are not a lot of things going right in our country and we have the privilege to be able to do what we love and inspire people in life, not just sports people,” Kolisi said.\n“Where I come from I couldn't dream I could be here today. We come from different walks of life. I had my own goals and ambitions. I want to look after my family, I want to give back to my community. You need to come and see South Africa to understand. When we come together nothing can stop us, not just in sport but also in life.”\nThe majority of people who came out to celebrate the Boks’ achievements, will never have the means to travel to Paris. But the Boks, in their own way, took all South Africans with them on this remarkable journey.\n“In the Eastern Cape many families are still recovering from the Covid-19 disaster. We have lost our relatives, friends and parents and we face unemployment. The Springbok victory has restored hope to many of us,” Sikelelwe Gxotani, originally from the village of Tsholomnqa, told my Daily Maverick colleague Estelle Ellis during the Boks’ parade through the Eastern Cape.\n“Some of us, like me, have already lost hope in our lives, but the Springboks showed us that nothing is impossible,” she said.\n“I started a business in 2021, but it did not go well. This victory gives us hope that we can achieve our goals. [Makazole] Mapimpi is from my home village in Tsholomnqa in East London and we are proud of him.\n“We are proud of his success. All of them restore hope that even if you are coming from a rural area you can achieve your goal.”\nCOURAGE.\nSuccess in France was the Boks’ second title as a collective, having also won RWC 2019 in Japan. It took the Boks’ World Cup record to a scarcely believable four titles in eight appearances at the showpiece event.\nTheir success, achieved in the most remarkable of ways, but winning their three knockout matches by a collective three points, is unlikely to ever be repeated.\nVictory in France was the culmination of a six-year plan that never changed even after the success in Japan. When RasNaber (the collective noun for Erasmus and Nienaber) became Bok coaches in 2018, winning in France was their stated goal.\nClaiming the title in 2019, thrashing England 32-12 in the final in Yokohama, could easily have led to a mindset of ‘job done.’ Instead, it fuelled the desire to fulfil the 2018 promise even further.\nNothing was left to chance and every aspect of the Boks was overhauled. This era of Springbok rugby became the most transparent and likeable in history. There are many reasons for that, from smart selections, manic attention to detail, carefully crafted gameplans and strategies and open and frank communication.\nBut the most vital aspect of the RasNaber era was courage.\nIt was the courage to try new things, comfortable that they might fail. In fact, failure, when measured by losing Tests, was never viewed as failure within this group.\nSure, they lost and it hurt. But failure was used to improve, tweak and tinker. That takes courage because Test rugby, especially in South Africa, is a results driven business.\nNo defeat [or victory] was wasted because every selection and every strategy was devised with the goal of winning RWC 2023 in mind. Some plans worked and others didn’t.\nIt was the courage to make Kolisi captain and allow him to blossom into the sport’s most respected figure. That decision emerged from the courage to see transformation as an opportunity, and not a burden.\nIt was the courage to be different and the courage to embrace differences.\nIt was the courage to extend an olive branch to referees after accepting that publicly humiliating them had been a mistake. It was the courage to learn and evolve while having a clear plan and vision.\nIt was the courage to select seven forwards on the bench, or to name four scrum halves in a 23-man squad. What about the guts to yank their flyhalf after 31 minutes in a World Cup semi-final, or bring in a flyhalf [Handre Pollard] for an injured hooker [Malcolm Marx]?\nFEAR OF COMPLACENCY.\nRasNaber didn’t fear innovation. They feared complacency. Losing RWC Pool matches in 2019 and 2023 were not crises, as long as they grew from those experiences.\nHanding 13 new caps in their first Test in charge, against Wales in Washington in June 2018, was an early chance to quickly sort out players who could cope and those who couldn’t.\nThe Boks lost the Test, but of those 13 new caps, Ox Nché, Makazole Mapimpi, Kwagga Smith, Marvin Orie and Thomas du Toit emerged.\nFour years later, against Wales again, this time in Bloemfontein, they made 18 changes to the team for the second Test after winning the first 32-29 at Loftus. The callow team lost South Africa’s first home Test to Wales, going down 13-12.\nHowever, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Deon Fourie and Grant Williams made their Test debuts that day. Two of them were massively influential in beating the All Blacks at Stade de France.\nTo RasNaber, losing was acceptable as long as it had a purpose. They were not scared to lose, if they gleaned important lessons from those losses and answered certain questions.\nThey needed to know that when they reached France, they had a squad of 36-40 players who were virtually interchangeable, which would be able to function seamlessly through injuries and a demanding schedule. Essentially, if player A was out, player B had to be as good, and player C too.\nWinning three in consecutive weekends in the knockout stages at RWC 2023 by a combined three points, was not luck. It came down to minuscule edges honed during six years of refinement.\nThose tight victories over France [29-28], England [16-15] and the All Blacks [12-11] in Saint-Denis were the result of an unbreakable, never-give-in attitude developed over six years and executed by the right players.\nThat mindset was not moulded through winning all the time, it was shaped by defeats and setbacks on the road to Paris.\nThose losses were never wasted because they were used as lessons, which developed character and resilience.",
