  "text": "By Caroline Schelle December 30, 2023 — 7.08pm articles for later Add articles Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters took to the streets of Melbourne for the final time this year, vowing to continue gathering in the city until the violence in Gaza ends.\nThey defied drizzly conditions on Saturday afternoon to meet on the steps of the State Library for the 12th Free Palestine rally.\nPolice estimated about 6000 protesters marched through the CBD, many donning traditional keffiyeh scarves – a symbol of the Palestinian movement – waving flags or holding signs calling for a ceasefire.\nMum (R) Zeanab Hameed with her kids Ali (far L), Zahra and Sarah. (in chair) attend the Free Palestine rally in Melbourne.\nRoxburgh Park mum Zeanab Hameed said it was the ninth rally she had attended, and brought her children, Ali, Zahra and Sarah.\nShe said it was important that people kept speaking up about what was happening in Gaza and used their voices to stand up for those who couldn’t.\n“We’re very committed, and will be coming until the war stops against innocent civilians,” she said.\nPro-Palestinan protesters march through the streets of Melbourne. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui\nTwelve weeks ago, Hamas militants stormed Israeli towns, killing 1200 people and seizing 240 hostages. Since then, Israeli forces have laid much of the Gaza Strip to waste as it pursues its aim of eradicating the Islamist militants.\nMore than 21,500 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities – in the Hamas-controlled government – and about 85 per cent of the population of 2.3 million have fled their homes.\nAdvertisement During Saturday’s march in the city, protesters chanted the Free Palestine slogan,“from the river to sea, Palestine will be free”, which some Jewish people say is antisemitic because they believe it calls for the annihilation of Israel. However, Palestine advocates say the term calls for freedom and human rights for Palestinians.\nThey also chanted “ceasefire now”, “Palestine will never die”, “Albanese, Albanese genocide won’t go easy”, “out, out, Israel out” and “say it loud, say it clear, liberation is near” among others.\nEmma Eve brandishing her ‘Would you like a slice of resistence’ sign. Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui\nEmma Eve carried a sign with a slice of watermelon which read: “Would you like a slice of resistance?”\nThe 25-year-old from Coburg said watermelon had become a symbol of the Palestinian resistance.\n“Palestinians were not allowed to hold up their Palestinian flag, and so shared the watermelon, which has all the colours of the Palestinian flag, as a sign of their resistance,” she said.\nEve said she had attended protests for weeks and was upset at the government’s response to what was happening in the region, saying there was a genocide.\n“We have to keep protesting until something happens,” Eve said.\nGreens senator David Shoebridge addressed the protesters, slamming the Australian government for its response to the crisis.\n“The Australian people ... want our government to lend its support to end the bombing, and to end the killing, and we want the same,” he told the rally.\nCries of “shame” could be heard from crowd.\nIsrael has previously said it was doing what it could to avoid civilian casualties, but the high death toll has caused concern among even its staunchest allies.\nThe US has called for it to scale down the war in coming weeks and move to targeted operations against Hamas leaders. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon this month issued a joint statement supporting a pause in the fighting in Gaza and efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire.\nVictoria Police said there were “no issues of note” from Saturday’s protest, but CCTV vision would be reviewed.\n“Our top priority was keeping the peace to ensure the event did not impact the safety of the broader community,” a spokesperson said. “We will continue to retain communication with all communities which have a strong interest in events unfolding in the Middle East.”\nGet a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.
