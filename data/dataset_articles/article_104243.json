  "text": "BAGHDAD: Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday he supported Iraq’s “sovereignty and stability,” during a visit to Baghdad where he also met with Spanish troops.\n“My country, always at the request of the Iraqi authorities, will support the unity, sovereignty and stability of Iraq,” said Sanchez during a press conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohamed Shia Al-Sudani.\nSpain has deployed more than 300 soldiers as part of an international coalition and NATO’s mission in Iraq, commanded since May by Spanish General Jose Antonio\nAguero Martinez.\nOn Thursday, Sudani lauded the “coalition’s support for Iraqi efforts in its fight against terrorism.”\nThe coalition, deployed to fight the Daesh group, has faced increasing attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, most of which were claimed by Iran-aligned groups opposing Israel.\nFASTFACT\nSanchez, who was accompanied to Baghdad by a delegation of business leaders, said he is dedicated to the development of trade between Spain and Iraq.\nSanchez visited the Spanish troops at a military base in Baghdad’s high security Green Zone, where he thanked them on Spain’s behalf for their “efforts and sacrifices in favor of international security and stability.”\n“In Iraq, Spain has demonstrated for many years now our solid commitment to something that seems to have been questioned in recent years: multilateralism,” he said.\nIraq is experiencing comparative political stability after decades of conflict, but corruption and nepotism remain major obstacles in the oil-rich country.\nDominated by parties close to Iran, an ally of Palestinian militant group Hamas, tensions have escalated in Iraq since the group’s unprecedented attack on Israel and the subsequent air and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.\nSince mid-October, Washington has documented more than 100 drone and rocket attacks against US and other coalition troops deployed to Iraq and neighboring Syria.\nThe majority of the attacks in Iraq have been claimed by Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which opposes US support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\nSanchez, who was accompanied to Baghdad by a delegation of business leaders, said he is dedicated to the development of trade between Spain and Iraq, which derives more than 90 percent of its income from oil and gas.\nSudani said Iraq would take “preferential measures in favor of Spanish firms” that wanted to establish operations in his country, according to Iraq’s official news agency INA.",
