  "text": "Israeli Defense Minister Gallant, who continues military operations in the Gaza Strip, said on the 29th that \"the results are admirable, and the goal is not far off,\" and emphasized that the results are being achieved in the southern Khan-Yunis. With more than 2,1500 people killed in the Gaza Strip, more have been forced to flee as fighting intensifies in the south. The Israeli army, which is expanding its ground operations in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, announced on the 30th that it had killed dozens of fighters of the Islamic group Hamas in Gaza City, which it said it had already encircled. Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said on Monday that \"the intensive operations in the Gaza Strip will continue until the goal is achieved, and it is currently concentrated in Khanheis in the south. The results have been admirable, and we are far from achieving our goals,\" he said, emphasizing that the operation in the southern city of Khaneunis, where Hamas officials are believed to be hiding, has yielded results. Health authorities in the Gaza Strip said on the 29th that the death toll so far has risen to 29,2. OCHA = UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs points out that more than 1507,10 people have fled further south to Rafah in the past few days due to the intensification of fighting in Khan Yunis, where the Israeli army is expanding its operations. While many people are displaced and the delivery of humanitarian aid has become an urgent issue, OCHA says that the number of trucks that entered the Gaza Strip on the 29th is 81, which continues to be insufficient, and it is necessary to stop the fighting for further deliveries.",
