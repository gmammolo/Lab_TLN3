In his voluntary work as a special constable for another force and in his leadership of Special Constabulary and Volunteer Police Cadet programmes within Greater Manchester, he has improved service delivery to neighbourhoods – ultimately helping to build the public’s trust and confidence in policing.\"\nGreater Manchester&apos;s top cop, Chief Constable Stephen Watson, thanked Insp Hare for his tireless work - and said he was known for &apos;doing it right and doing it well&apos;.\nHe said: \"Inspector Hare is determined, enthusiastic, and tenacious in his service to the King and the public. Known by colleagues and partners for &apos;doing it right and doing it well&apos;.\n\"He is a credit to Greater Manchester Police and his previous force. Public order policing is of huge importance in the city of Manchester district and his contribution has undoubtedly made the locality a safer place to live, to work, and to visit.\n\"On behalf of Greater Manchester Police, I thank him for his service and to the voluntary contribution he has made through his involvement with Citizens in Policing programmes.\"\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
