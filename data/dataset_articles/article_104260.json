I'm happy with the win and excited for my team.\"\nIt followed teammate Zhang Zhizhen defeating Jiri Lehecka 5-7, 6-3, 6-4 in China's maiden appearance at the mixed teams tournament.\nZhang held his nerve against Lehecka in a heavy-hitting clash, with the world number 58 dictating from the baseline.\n\"I'm so happy I controlled my emotions well after losing the first set,\" he said.\nRuud, the top-ranked Norwegian in history after reaching a career-high two by making the 2022 US Open final, was a level above Tallon Griekspoor in a 6-3, 6-4 win at Sydney.\nHe converted three of seven break points to clinch victory in 72 minutes against a player who has risen to 23 in the world on the back of ATP Tour titles in Pune and Hertogenbosch this year.\nIt helped level the tie after experienced Dutchwoman Arantxa Rus downed Malene Helgo 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 in the women's singles.\nRuud, now ranked 11, returned to partner Ulrikke Eikeri in the mixed doubles, but they were unable to overcome Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof who rallied from a break down in each set to win 7-6 (7/5), 7-5.\n\"I think we just returned pretty well, we just found a way to break their game,\" said Schuurs.\nDespite losing the tie, Ruud said his singles win was \"the perfect start to the season\".\n\"I really like this court, it was a good match for me,\" said Ruud, who lost to Novak Djokovic in this year's French Open final.\nStory continues \"I'm ready for the new season, I'm motivated, I have a lot of energy in my legs.\"\nAlexander Zverev and three-time Grand Slam winner Angelique Kerber get their tournament under way later in Sydney when Germany take on Italy .\nWorld number one Iga Swiatek spearheads the Polish team in Perth when they face Brazil .\nmp/lb\nTRENDING 1.
