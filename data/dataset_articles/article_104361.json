  "text": "HYDERABAD: Spacetech startup Dhruva Space is all set to kick off the new year with a bang. The Hyderabad-based startup’s Leap-TD (Launching Expeditions for Aspiring Payloads-Technology Demonstrator) mission is scheduled to blast off onboard the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) PSLV-C58 Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on the morning of January 1, 2024.\nThe mission will see the Hyderabad-based Dhruva Space validate the functionality and robustness of its flagship P-30 nanosatellite platform and its sub-systems in-orbit. The P-30 platform is designed for low earth orbit (LEO) operations and will be a determining enabler in the spacetech company’s upcoming satellite missions, it said.\nThese subsystems include on-board computer, telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C ) in ultra high frequency (UHF), beacon in UHF, attitude control system with a reaction wheel and power distribution board. Dhruva Space will also be collaborating with the Indian Institute of Space Science & Technology (IIST), Thiruvananthapuram, for carrying out TT&C activities.\n“We are excited about the imminent validation of our P-30 nanosatellite platform aboard ISRO’s PSLV-C58. The Leap initiative marks a significant moment, underscoring our commitment to delivering full-stack and hosted payload solutions to our customers. This will be further enriched by new, upcoming pursuits in the fields of earth observation IoT solutions and more,” Dhruva Space founder & CEO Sanjay Nekkanti said.\nDhruva Space said the Leap-TD mission features a derivative of its P-30 satellite platform that is integrated to ISRO’s PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) which will allow in-orbit scientific experiments using the spent PS4 stage as an orbital platform.\nIt said the Leap initiative will then transition into full-fledged hosted payload solutions for space missions, signifying Dhruva Space’s readiness to offer hosted payload services, which comprises a portion of a satellite such as a sensor, instrument or a set of communication transponders owned by its customers. The hosted portion of the satellite operates independently of the main spacecraft but shares the satellite’s power supply, transponders and also ground systems in some cases, it explained.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
