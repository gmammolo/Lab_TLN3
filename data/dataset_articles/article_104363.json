Zverev came from behind to beat Lorenzo Sonego 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-4 and teamed with Angelique Kerber to win the decisive mixed doubles against Sorengo and Angelica Moratelli 6-3, 6-0. \"We're both extremely happy, the whole team is extremely happy,\" Zverev said. \"Angie played great in mixed and her singles was a high level in her first match back.\" Kerber, the three-time Grand Slam singles winner, played her first match since giving birth in February. She lost to Jasmine Paolini 6-4, 7-5. World No. 1 Iga Swiatek helped top-seeded Poland gain an unassailable 2-0 lead against Brazil, which lost for the second time in two days.
