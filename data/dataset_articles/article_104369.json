  "text": "“In civilian killing, last year 31 civilians died, this year it is 14. Last year, there were 125 terror-related activities. This year, it is 46. There is a 63% decline in such activities,” DGP Swain stated during a press conference. He further said that as many as 55 foreign terrorists have been gunned down by security forces so far this year.\n“In 48 anti-terrorist operations, we have neutralised 76 terrorists, including 55 foreigners. The trend of foreign terrorists getting killed more starting in 2022 and continued this year, making it clear that our actual fight is against infiltrators,” he said, adding that anti-terrorism operations will be carried out with even more vigour in 2024.\nDGP Swain also informed that J&K has witnessed a steep decline of 80% in youth joining the ranks of terror outfits in J&K from last year. “There is an 80 per cent decline in terror recruitment this year. Year-on-year comparison shows that 130 locals joined terrorism in 2022 and this year, till date the number is 22. We will try to stop the recruitment completely which is essential to end the cycle of violence,” the J&K top cop was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.\nHe added, “When there is recruitment, action happens and the fallout follows, continuing the cycle. I am seeing the decline in recruitment as saving 113 people from getting killed this year.”\n(With inputs from agencies)",
