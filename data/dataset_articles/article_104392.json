  "text": "Blood of General Razi paves way for Islamic Ummah: Interior minister TEHRAN- The Iranian Interior Minister has stated that the blood of General Razi Mousavi who was assassinated by Israel will pave the way for the Islamic Ummah to break through the barriers erected by adversaries. Addressing the public on Saturday during the commemoration of martyr Razi, Ahmad Vahidi emphasized the transformative impact of General Razi's sacrifice, portraying him as an exemplary figure for the global youth. The minister condemned the assassination of the honorable martyr, attributing his martyrdom to a targeted attack by the enemies of God and the people— specifically, the Zionist regime. He underscored General Razi's distinguished service to the resistance axis over a span of more than 30 years. Directing his message to the country's youth, Vahidi urged an understanding of the origins, accomplishments, and profound spiritual influence of the martyrs. Despite General Razi's posthumous recognition, the minister highlighted that this honorable martyr lived in relative obscurity during his lifetime. Commenting on the atrocities committed by the Zionist regime, Vahidi asserted that their egregious actions contributed to their own demise. He dismissed the notion that targeting noble figures weakens the resistance front, labeling it a “false thought.” Vahidi drew parallels with the transformative impact of General Soleimani's martyrdom, asserting that each martyr, including General Razi, plays a crucial role. He predicted that the bloodshed, including that of the noble martyr and thousands of Palestinian counterparts, will expedite the decline of the Zionist regime. According to Vahidi, General Soleimani has become a widely recognized role model, and his ideas continue to resonate globally. In conclusion, the minister emphasized General Soleimani's enduring place in the hearts of Iranians, the regional resistance movement, Islamic nations, and freedom seekers worldwide.",
