  "text": "The first surprise is that the Australian War Memorial's youngest ever bugler is not a military man.The second is that Jackson Boyd is a fan of heavy metal, a music as different from the gentle sweetness of his performances of the Last Post\\u003ci\\u003e \\u003c/i\\u003eas granite is from silk.As he performs in the twilight at the daily ceremonies at the memorial, he stands ram-rod straight, his left hand clenched (and drenched in the current downpours). His back arches backwards like a sentry's.\\u003cbr\\u003eRather than being a genuine military sentry, he is a student at the ANU, recruited to the memorial's corps of buglers when he was 15 and a schoolboy at Alfred Deakin High School in Canberra. He applied when he was 14 but had to wait until his 15\\u003csup\\u003eth\\u003c/sup\\u003e birthday under the AWM bugling rules.But he's impressive. He has the right military demeanour for the ceremony. He marches in step for his exit at the end. He looks the part.\\u003cbr\\u003eAnd he has nerves of steel - or, rather, he seems to. He actually says that he is nervous, playing solo to absolute silence.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe piece was first published in the 1790s. It came to signify the end of a day and the end of a battle as a signal to the wounded and lost to return towards the bugle.It is now embedded in the daily routine of the Memorial, starting at 4.45pm, though soon to move 15 minutes earlier to 4.30pm. Each ceremony involves the reading of an account of the life and sacrifice of a veteran, culminating in the sounding of the Last Post.He started playing the trumpet in Year 5 at Garran Primary School. He said he got involved in what he called the marvellous ACT Instrumental Music Program which aims to have a brass or woodwind band in every Canberran public school.From the trumpet, it's a short step to the bugle (which is a simplified version of a trumpet). He found himself playing the Last Post in high school and then his father got wind of the need for buglers at the war memorial.",
