  "text": "Local terror recruitment down 80% in 2023: Jammu Kasmir DGP\nSRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir has seen an 80% decline in local terror recruitment in 2023 and foreigners are leading the charge, DGP RR Swain said Saturday.\n“Only 22 recruitments took place in 2023. J&K Police will try at every level to curb recruitment in terror ranks and put an end to the cycle of violence,” Swain said, addressing the DGP’s customary year-end news conference in Jammu.\nAttributing the dip to collaborative efforts of police and other security forces, Swain said 113 terrorists were “neutralised” in 2023, leaving 31 local operatives active, an all-time low. “27 are in Kashmir zone and four in Jammu,” the DGP added.\nSwain pointed out that two more separatist organisations were banned under UAPA this year, Democratic Freedom Party led by Shabir Shah and Muslim League led by Masarat Alam.\nAccording to the DGP, the security forces’ war is not only against the gun-wielding terrorists but also the ideology which pushes J&K youths towards bloodshed and separatism. “Our war will continue against those who glorify and legitimise terrorist actions. The fight will continue till this ideology is wiped out,” Swain said.\nOutlining the focus of future offensives, the DGP indicated that it would be against infiltrators. “Foreigners are taking the front (in terror). It is clear that the future fight will be against those who infiltrate from outside,” Swain said. He was flanked by ADGP Vijay Kumar and other top officers.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
