  "text": "Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United. Premier League.\nThe City GroundAttendance29,529.\nReport and free match highlights as Nottingham Forest claim back-to-back Premier League wins under new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo; Man Utd were offered route back into game by Matt Turner as Marcus Rashford cancelled out Nicolas Dominguez's opener but Morgan Gibbs-White sealed win\nSaturday 30 December 2023 19:56, UK\nNottingham Forest beat Manchester United for the first time since 1992 as Morgan Gibbs-White’s late strike sealed a 2-1 win at the City Ground after yet another dire performance from Erik ten Hag's side.\nForest goalkeeper Matt Turner appeared to have given Man Utd a route back into the game when his poor pass was capitalised on by Marcus Rashford, scoring his first league goal from open play since September 1, after Nicolas Dominguez's second-half opener.\nAs Man Utd chased what would have been an undeserved winner, Forest caught them on the break to clinch the victory just four minutes later. Gibbs-White's first-time strike from the edge of the box - set up by former United forward Anthony Elanga - the only piece of real quality in an otherwise poor game.\nForest have now won back-to-back games under new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo, moving them five points clear of the relegation zone. Man Utd, meanwhile, are winless in five games on the road and remain nine points off fourth.\nThere was talk of a turning point for Manchester United after their comeback victory against Aston Villa on Boxing Day but Saturday's performance at the City Ground failed to deliver on that promise with the absence of Rasmus Hojlund leaving United short up front.\nRashford deputised as the lone striker but struggled with his back to goal as he fed on scraps. United were devoid of any attacking threat with Aaron Wan-Bissaka's deflected shot their only effort on target of the first half.\nForest made a strong start and nearly scored through a Raphael Varane own goal. The defender threw out an anxious leg at Elanga's cross which nearly caught out Andre Onana, who came in for criticism from Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville for his distribution.\n\"Onana came with a reputation for being really good on the ball but l just don't think he is that good on the ball,\" said Neville on co-commentary. \"He is so erratic.\" The goalkeeper wasn't the only United player guilty of this in the second half.\nThere was an apparent miscommunication between Jonny Evans and Raphael Varane for Forest's opener. The former tried to play Forest offside, but his centre-back partner seemingly didn't get the message and Dominguez took full advantage.\nRestored to the starting line-up from the left wing playing as an auxiliary No 10, Dominguez fired into the bottom corner with ease after being left free in the box by Scott McTominay, a half-time introduction for 18-year-old Kobbie Mainoo.\nForest deserved the lead but their goalkeeper let them down with his distribution toward the end of the game. Alejandro Garnacho cut out his poor pass - not his first of the day - and set up Rashford, who showed composure to score his third club goal of the season.\n\"I've got no sympathy for Turner,\" said Neville on co-commentary. \"It is absolutely ridiculous. He is useless with his feet and he has proven it time and again. But he still tries. Just put your foot through it!\"\nThe momentum, at this stage, was with United but they were caught out after throwing too many bodies forward. Elanga, who came through the club's academy, came back to bite United on the break as he teed up Gibbs-White on the edge of the box to inflict United's 14th defeat of the season.\nNottingham Forest are next in action when hosting Championship side Blackpool in the FA Cup on January 7, before a trip to Brentford beckons when Premier League duty resumes on January 20, live on Sky Sports; kick-off 5.30pm.\nManchester United's respective FA Cup third round tie takes place on January 8 against Wigan Athletic, before hosting Tottenham live on Super Sunday on January 14; kick-off 4.30pm.",
