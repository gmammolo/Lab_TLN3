The Brigade says that the examination of the missile’s wreckage showed that the small arms fire caused an explosion of its fuel tanks, which led to the missile losing control and altitude. The missile crashed, but its warhead did not detonate. [Ukraine under massive air attack: civilians casualties reported in Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia (updates)] “The National Guard’s fire teams are designed to counter air strikes, including shooting down missiles and kamikaze drones. Combined with the efficient work of air defense units, this allows us to increase the success rate of shooting down air targets and thus save infrastructure and the lives of our citizens,” the Pechersk Brigade noticed. The National Guard does not mention the missile type. However, according to the December 29 [report](https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/12/29/military-ukraine-downs-114-of-158-missiles-and-drones-during-russias-most-massive-air-attack/?swcfpc=1) by the Air Force, Russia launched 90 air-based Kh-101/Kh-555/Kh-55 cruise missiles, of which the air defenders destroyed 87. Additionally, Russia launched Kh-22/Kh-32, Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, and ballistic missiles of several types during the attack, but Ukraine did not claim successful interceptions of any of those.
