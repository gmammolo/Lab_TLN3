  "text": "The Defence Headquarters has explained why the South-West region of the country remained largely peaceful in 2023. It admitted that states in the region experienced some pockets of criminality such as kidnapping, robbery, illegal arms trafficking, and farmer-herder clashes. It also said that the naira redesign introduced during the era of the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, and fuel scarcity earlier in the year sparked violence in the region. The Director, Defence Media Operation, Maj-Gen Edward Buba, who spoke on Friday while highlighting the troops’ successes across the country in Abuja, said soldiers were deployed to the region to prevent the influx of terrorists from Kogi and Niger states. He said, “The South-West Geo-political zone has remained largely calm. Within the year, the zone has witnessed cases of armed robbery, illegal arms trafficking, kidnappings, and farmer-herder clashes. “It also witnessed violent protests orchestrated by the Central Bank of Nigeria naira redesign policy and fuel scarcity. Illegal oil bunkering was also a challenge, particularly in Ikorodu, Atlas Cove, Badagry, and Ogere.” He said, “Cybercrimes and drug peddling contributed to the threat picture in the SW zone. However, the armed forces through joint efforts with other agencies, and local authorities, and increased public cooperation in sharing vital information, significantly doused these criminal activities in the zone. “Meanwhile, the conduct of Operations AWATSE and MESA significantly stabilised the SW region.” Buba added, “Additionally, (were) troops deployed to address reports of the migration of terrorists from the North-East and North-West into the South-West zone, particularly to Osun State. Accordingly, troops sustained operations in the Old Oyo National Park and Kainji Lake National Park to curb the influx of terrorists from Kogi and Niger States.",
