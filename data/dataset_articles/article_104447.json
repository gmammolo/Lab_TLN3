  "text": "Photographer Ziv Koren has captured powerful images of Miya Shem, who has returned after spending 55 days in captivity. Shem was accompanied by Koren as she made her way back home to Kibbutz Nirim, where she was greeted by a group of Hamas terrorists. The photographer documented the tense and emotional moments as Shem returned to her community after her traumatic experience. The images captured by Koren show the bravery and resilience of Shem as she faced the terrorists who had held her captive. One striking image shows a Kalashnikov bullet lodged in her arm, a haunting reminder of the dangers she faced during her time in captivity. Another powerful image shows Shem’s shirt, which miraculously survived the Black Sabbath, a time when the kibbutz came under heavy attack from Hamas forces. The return of Shem to Kibbutz Nirim was a powerful and emotional moment for the community, as they welcomed her back with open arms. The images captured by Koren serve as a testament to the strength and courage of Shem, as well as the resilience of the community in the face of adversity. In addition to documenting Shem’s return, Koren also captured the heroic battle that took place on Nirim as the standby squad realized they were alone and fought against dozens of terrorists. It was only at the end of the battle that they discovered the commander of the southern brigade was also present, preventing a potential disaster. Koren’s images provide a powerful and poignant look at the ongoing conflict in the region and the strength and bravery of those who are affected by it. His work serves as a reminder of the human cost of war and the resilience of those who endure it.",
