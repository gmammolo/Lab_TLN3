Today, we were his family and now, he is finally home,' State Rep. Steve Xiarhos wrote in a tribute [Zachary Rogers](/author/zachary-rogers) Dozens of strangers and one long-lost friend gathered Friday to honor a [Vietnam](https://themessenger.com/search?s=Vietnam) veteran who has passed away after battling terminal cancer alone.
