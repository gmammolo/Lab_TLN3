  "text": "KOTA KINABALU: No force with ill intent can break Sabah as long as the people are united, says Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor.\nHe said as Chief Minister, he is committed to seeing Sabah remain united, prosperous, and inclusive.\n“We are strong only when we are united. No force with ill intent can break us as Sabahans. United, we will be able to withstand any attempts to undermine stability and to ensure that development can proceed unhindered,\" Hajiji said in his New Year 2024 message.\nHe added that he is touched by and grateful to the people and all like-minded supporters who have stood with the state government, believing in its sincerity to do what is best for Sabah.\n\"Let us put politics aside and discard any divisiveness that will only pull us apart. We must forge forward into the new year with resolve, united in diversity and committed to doing good in accordance with the mandate given to us by the rakyat,\" he said.\nWith the people's support, Hajiji said that the state government had made good strides in progressing its development plan, the Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya (SMJ).\n\"As we enter the New Year, it is time to reflect on the past year and look forward to the new year with hope and optimism. Despite challenges in 2023, we have been steadfast in implementing the SMJ agenda and staying on course to see it through. Our commitment to growth remains unwavering,” he said.\nHajiji said the recently passed State 2024 Budget amounting to RM5.701bil is a testament to the state government's commitment to drive economic growth and development in Sabah.\n\"We have set our sights on the many opportunities the state can leverage in all sectors. We will continue to build on our successes and pursue new investment opportunities to create economic spin-offs and jobs for the people,\" he said.\nHowever, he said all these successes and plans will account for nothing without the combined effort and commitment of all as well as a conducive environment to pursue the state's development goals.\nHajiji thanked his Cabinet colleagues, civil servants and the people of Sabah for their continuous support and wishes everyone a happy and prosperous new year.\nOpen Modal ×",
