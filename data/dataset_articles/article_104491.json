  "text": "2023-12-31 07:50:39 Eleven people who intervened during the attack in Arras (Pas-de-Calais) on October 13, 2023, were knighted in the promotion of the Legion of Honor on January 1, published Sunday, December 31, at Official newspaper . Among them are six police officers and five staff from the Gambetta high school in front of which professor Dominique Bernard was stabbed to death by a radicalized former student. Immediately after this attack, the teacher was posthumously elevated to the rank of knight by the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron. In total, the new civilian promotion of the Legion of Honor, the highest of French national distinctions, rewards “on par” 352 people working “in the service of the general interest”, specifies the Grand Chancellery in a press release. Illustrious or unknown to the general public, these people are divided into different ranks (knights, officers, commanders, etc.). Two join the prestigious circle of grand crosses, the highest dignity of the Legion of Honor held by only 68 other people: the CEO of the world’s number one luxury company LVMH, Bernard Arnault, and the hematologist Dominique Meyer, member of the Academy of Sciences.
