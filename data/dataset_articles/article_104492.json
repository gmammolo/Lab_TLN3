Image: Bryan Wiles\nWhen 17-year-old exiled Pole Jas Baraniuk found himself sleeping in a Dundee police cell one night in 1942, it seemed like a happy place compared with the horrors he’d experienced over the previous three years.\nBorn on March 13 1925 in Horodnica, Eastern Poland – which is now 100 miles inside Ukraine – Jas was just 14-years-old when in 1940 he and his family were “ethnically cleansed” by Soviet soldiers.\nFollowing the partition of Poland , the family were forcibly taken on a 21-day journey in cattle wagons to a Siberian labour camp called Zapadnej Uczastek.\nWhen Stalin declared an amnesty so that the Poles could form an army to fight Germany, Jas pretended to be 19-years-old so that he could join the army and get regular food for himself and his mother.\nJas Baraniuk on the McLeans’ doorstep in Dundee during the Second World War. Image: Bryan Wiles For Jas, this was just the start of an adventure that would see him travel through a series of camps in Teheran, Iraq, India, Cape Town and finally to Dundee.\nBut how did he end up in a Dundee police cell just two years before he was dropped into Arnhem?\nSecond World War story led from Poland to Dundee via Siberian labour camps The powerful story of a family ripped from its Polish roots and flung into the frozen wastes of Siberia during the Second World War has been told in a new book.\nThe Chocolate Suitcase, by retired Cambridgeshire physics teacher Bryan Wiles and based on fact-based testimony from his Polish in-laws, is a novel that conducts the reader on a stirring emotional odyssey spanning the globe.\nFor Jas, Dundee was to become a home from home as he undertook parachute training before fighting at the Battle of Arnhem .\nHaving failed to find a billet on his arrival in Scotland, the teenage soldier was initially offered a bed in the cell of a police station – and the police officer on duty, Constable McLean, and his wife then invited him to lodge with them.\n“Jas went to Dundee aged 17 in 1942,” said Bryan, a retired physics teacher, in an interview with The Courier from his home near Peterborough.\nBryan Wiles holding a carved Polish icon. Image: Bryan Wiles “He arrived looking for a billet. He couldn’t find anywhere. He ended up at the police station.\n“The police officer gave him a cell.\n“Jas had been through enormous hardships in Russia through labour camps at the edge of starvation, so a cell seemed like a happy place for him to be.\n“He willingly took this cell, stayed overnight.\n“Meanwhile the policeman went home and spoke to his wife and then when he returned they took Jas in.\n“Mrs McLean became his ‘Scottish mother’ and he referred to her as such for the rest of his life.\n“He stayed with them while doing all his training and was in contact with him ever after.”\nHow did the author find the Second World War story from Poland to Dundee? The story centres on the experiences of Bryan’s wife Rysia’s Polish family.\nBryan recorded their recollections over many years.\nIt is an inspiring tale of love, loss, endurance and ultimate triumph.\nBryan, 68, married Rysia who is the daughter of Bronek and Anna Baranek, about 40 years ago.\nRysia’s parents were on the same Russian escapade as Jas.\nHe got to know the parents and heard bits of the stories over many years.\nBryan Wiles’ Polish parents-in-law Anna and Bronek Baranek. Image: Bryan Wiles It was only in 1990 when Jas, who had emigrated to Canada in 1950, retired and made his first visit back to the UK since the war, that he heard more.\nJas met up with Rysia’s parents and started talking.\nBryan recalls how his “jaw just dropped” when he heard the stories and he was keen to write them down.\n“I began to interview Rysia’s parents thoroughly about it and took the story down,” he said.\n“It was a wonderful thing really because they were quite old.\n“They were talking about life when they were very young so it was quite an uplifting thing to do and gave them a real purpose in life at the end of their lives.”\nHow did the Polish family end up in the Russian labour camps of Siberia? The story tells how Rysia’s father, Bronek Baranek, was a forester living in Eastern Poland with his teenage wife, Anna, when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.\nThey had a young child and Anna was newly pregnant with a second.\nFollowing the German then Russian invasion, Poland was partitioned and their village fell under Russian rule.\nAmongst the often “forgotten” 1.7 million Poles deported to slave labour camps in Siberia by the Russians in 1940 were the Baraneks.\nThe whole family, consisting of Bronek, Anna and baby, Bronek’s mother and his sister, Maria, with her 14-year-old son, Jaś were ethnically cleansed to Siberia.\nAfter being disgorged into the deep Siberian snows at sub-zero temperatures, they found themselves in a barracks, in a pine forest, just north of the Mongolian border.\nThe family was set to work felling trees.\nThey survived two extreme winters, which were so harsh that occasionally birds give up on life mid-flight and fell from the sky.\nFood was always in short supply.\nBronek was brave and resourceful in finding ways to buck the system to get extra rations.\nAnna gave birth to a second son, but lost the first to illness.\nShe suffered from night blindness due to malnutrition.\nMaria came to the rescue, obtaining extra food, in secret, from the friendly Russian camp cook.\nThe second winter claimed Bronek and Maria’s mother.\nBronek was moved from the forest to the village, where he was forced to build log cabins for the exiles.\nThe family moved into one of these.\nThey teamed up with three other families so that they could offer mutual support.\nHow did some of the Poles escape the Siberian labour camps? When Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, Stalin granted an ‘amnesty’ to the Poles, freeing them so that they could form an army to help his war effort.\nWith only about one third of the Poles sent to Siberian labour camps surviving, the family took another appalling journey in a cattle wagon during which Bronek was separated from the group and had to jump on the back of the moving train to maintain contact.\nThey arrived in a poverty-stricken Samarkand, where they were set to work on a collective farm, picking cotton.\nOnce again, Bronek proved to be adaptable and helped the group of four families gain a little extra for their efforts.\nPolish troops praying at an altar in Bethlehem. Image: Bryan Wiles Bronek then offered his services in designing and building a drying shed and so was paid extra for first wetting and then drying the cotton.\nWhen work came to an end, the men were told to enlist into the Polish Army.\nBut it turned out to be a false alarm.\nHomeless, hungry and desperate they got work unloading cargo from trains.\nPetty pilfering helped to keep them alive.\nThey were housed in a disused church, boarded up many years before by the Communists, and used the collection plate as a receptacle for stolen tea released from secret pockets stitched into their trousers.\nThe men joined the army in Kermine.\nWojtek the bear with Polish troops during the Second World War. Image: Bryan Wiles The women suffered hardships, fighting off aggressive thugs and eating grass roots to survive.\nWhen army rations arrived, things improved.\nThe army and the women moved west and crossed the Caspian Sea in paddle steamers.\nThe British fed and clothed them in Pahlevi.\nBronek was now in the Second Polish Corps under General Wladyslaw Anders .\nHe moved from Teheran to Bagdad and then west to Jerusalem and then Cairo.\nHe joined the 22nd Transport Company as a lorry driver and became an instructor to the PESTKI, the Polish Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps.\nHe met Wojtek , the famous ‘Soldier Bear’.\nHe was then shipped to Italy and fought his way up the Italian boot, taking part in the bloodbath of Monte Cassino , a costly victory which ended with the Polish and British flags fluttering above the remains of the hill-top monastery dashed to dust by Allied bombing.\nPolish paratrooper Jas returned to Dundee after the Battle of Arnhem Meanwhile Maria’s son, Jaś, had been sent on his own odyssey from Persia to India, then South Africa and on to Scotland, where he trained to be a paratrooper.\nJas, now 19, fought side by side with the British in the heroic but ill-fated parachute assault centred on the Dutch city of Arnhem.\nHe was involved in heavy fighting for about one week before the long retreat back to England, then returning to his adoptive home in Dundee.\nMaria, Anna and the now toddler, Zdziś found refuge in India in a purpose built camp at Valivade, near Bombay.\nDundee woman Mrs McLean (left) with Polish soldier Jas Baraniuk in Dundee. Image: Bryan Wiles They saw out the war for four years.\nWith Poland taken over by a hostile Communist government in 1946, and with many Poles settling in the UK and elsewhere, the family reunited in England.\nMaria had, by this time, been writing to a Canadian farmer and moved there to marry him.\nJaś married a Polish girl Ola that he met in Germany and they followed his mother to Canada.\nJas and Ola on their wedding day in 1946. Image: Bryan Wiles Jaś and Ola continued writing to the McLeans’ Dundee-born daughter Lillian right up to their passing (Jaś in 2008 and Ola in 2017).\nWhy is the book called The Chocolate Suitcase? Bryan added: “Having known hard times, Jaś bought a large amount of chocolate in Cape Town and kept it as an insurance against possible future hunger.\n“He stored it in a metal suitcase and welded it shut so that he could not access it during his travels.\nFinding better times in Scotland, he opened the suitcase to reveal a congealed mess that he had to throw away.\n“He vowed that whenever he gets chocolate, he will eat it.\nThis story gives rise to the book’s title.”\nThe Chocolate Suitcase by Bryan Wiles The Chocolate Suitcase by Bryan Wiles is available from Amazon at £15.",
