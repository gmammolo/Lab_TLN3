  "text": "Former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez has shown her class by powering Canada to a 2-1 United Cup victory over Chile.\nThe world No. 35 made light work of Daniela Seguel in the women's singles with a 6-2 6-3 win at Ken Rosewall Arena in Sydney on Sunday, before teaming up with Steven Diez in the mixed doubles.\nDiez, who lost 7-5 6-4 to Nicolas Jarry in the singles rubber, stepped in for Felix Auger-Aliassime, who was sidelined with a minor knee issue.\nThe pairing of Diez and 21-year-old Fernandez were made to fight their way past Tomas Barrios Vera and Seguel, eventually prevailing 10-8 in a match tiebreak after sharing sets 7-5 4-6.\n\"I'm extremely happy with the way I played,\" Fernandez said, after dispatching of Seguel in little over an hour.\n\"It wasn't the greatest match because it is my first match of the season, the nerves, but I'm extremely happy with the way that I was able to manage it.\n\"I enjoyed myself on the court and I'm just finding solutions\n\"I couldn't contain my happiness because I saw the hard work paying off and hopefully I can do more of that this year.\"\nThe Canada-Chile clash was the only tie in Sydney on Sunday, but tennis fans in Perth will be treated to a bumper day of action at RAC Arena.\nGreat Britain face the USA, with the result set to have huge ramifications for Australia's hopes of advancing to the knockout stages after the home side lost 2-1 to the British side on Friday.\nLater in Perth, Serbia ace and defending Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic gets his season under way against Zhang Zhizhen of China.\nDjokovic is looking to build towards winning a record 11th Australian Open crown.",
