(Photo by Wojtek RADWANSKI / AFP)\nSouth Africa has received support for its decision to take Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for ‘genocidal acts’ in Gaza , including from the ruling ANC.\nIn a significant development, South Africa filed an urgent case against Israel at the ICJ also known as the World Court on Friday, accusing the state of crimes of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza\nThe move which has been lauded by some, comes after nearly three months of relentless Israeli bombardment which has killed more than 21,500 people, about two thirds of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry following Hamas’ 7 October attack on Israel.\nALSO READ: SA takes Israel to International Court of Justice accusing it of ‘genocidal acts’\nAccountability The African National Congress (ANC) has commended government’s decision to approach the ICJ .\nRead more ‘SA continues to humiliate itself in the international arena’- Jewish Board of Deputies ANC national spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said the decision signifies the nation’s unwavering commitment to justice, human rights, and the principles enshrined in international law.\n“The ANC stands in solidarity with the South African government’s pursuit of justice through the appropriate international legal mechanisms. The decision to seek the intervention of the ICJ underscores the ANC’s dedication to uphold values of peace, justice, and human dignity.\n“We emphasize the importance of accountability for any violations of international law and stress the need for a comprehensive and fair investigation to determine responsibility,” Bhengu-Motsiri said.\nGeorge Galloway\nLong live the #ANC Long live #SouthAfrica Long live #Palestine #Gaza #GazaGenocide\n🇿🇦🇵🇸 pic.twitter.com/GnW05nUSCy\n— ANC SECRETARY GENERAL | Fikile Mbalula (@MbalulaFikile) December 30, 2023 ALSO READ: Gaza turned into ‘concentration camp’ – SA refers Israel to ICC for war crimes\nSupport Good party secretary-general Brett Herron also welcomed the decision.\n“It is, though, too soon to pop champagne corks, as the application will greatly test the UN court’s fortitude and ability to enforce global conventions such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.”\nThe Economic Freedom Fighter’s (EFF) Nazier Paulsen said more should be done to hold Israel accountable for genocide.\n“We should demand more. This is possible when we act in solidarity. Around the world decent citizens are using their voices, standing together and taking to the streets to demand that their governments act against the genocide unfolding in the Middle East.\n“We want more. We must demand that SA citizens serving in the Israeli Occupation Forces are prosecuted. Political parties that support the genocidal Israelis must be banned and their leaders prosecuted. It’s sheer hypocrisy to maintain any diplomatic or trade relations with a country that we know is committing a genocide,” Paulsen said in a X post.\nWe should demand more.
