  "text": "Brown Acropol Athens – Rooftop Jacuzzis Night View\nIn light of the current difficulties in Israel and the increase in demand for short vacations nearby for members of the security forces, their families, and Israeli citizens, the Brown Hotels Collection, in cooperation with Israir Airlines, is offering a New Year’s vacation package, which includes a flight and accommodation in one of the Brown hotels on the coastal plains, islands, and cities throughout Greece. For those looking for a vacation break in Israel, Brown is opening its hotels in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Eilat and is offering special price deals, along with the chef’s restaurants and the collection’s spa facilities.\nThe Brown Greece collection includes five-star resorts, boutique hotels, and urban hotels suitable for families, couples, and individuals who want to disconnect from the tense routine in Israel, vacation in the Mediterranean country, and enjoy the European atmosphere.\nDebrah Brown – Executive sea view.

The Brown collection consists of the Brown Beach House, Villa Brown, Brown Lighthouse, and Debra Brown.\nAt the beginning of the Iron Sword War, Brown Hotels joined the national effort to host evacuated residents from the south and north in hotels throughout the country, providing residents with support, activities, and initiatives, opening children’s and youth clubs and operating them with a team of volunteers and musical performances to raise morale.\nLeon Avigad, founder and co-owner of Brown Hotel Group said: “In these difficult times, alongside the ongoing fighting, Brown is witnessing a growing demand from soldiers, reservists, their families, and Israeli citizens for a momentary respite from the complex reality and short vacations in nearby destinations. In order to meet the need and enable the citizens of the country to disconnect and connect back to themselves, the Brown Hotels Collection, in collaboration with Israir, is launching a New Year’s sale for family and couple vacations at Brown Hotels in Athens Special prices, starting at $198 per person. For those who are interested in a blue and white vacation, we are offering a winter deal of 30% off plus an additional 5% discount for Club Brown members. Prices for double rooms in Israel begin at NIS 493 on an accommodation-only basis.”\nIsraeli residents can book accommodations in a variety of hotels from the Brown Hotels collection through the website at: https://brownhotels.com\nThis article was written in cooperation with the Brown Hotels Collection.",
