December 2023, 1:08 p.m.\nDiplomacy: Tie between Beijing and Moscow strengthened in 2023, says Xi\nDuring an exchange of greetings on Sunday with Vladimir Putin, the Chinese leader welcomed the development of relations between the two countries.\nVladimir Putin (left) and Xi Jinping strengthened ties as Western countries turned their backs on Moscow.\nAFP\nChinese President Xi Jinping estimated that relations between Beijing and Moscow had strengthened in 2023, during an exchange of greetings on Sunday with Vladimir Putin. Looking back on the past year with his Russian counterpart, the Chinese president estimated that “the material bases and in public opinion of our relationship have become stronger”, according to the state channel CCTV.\n“In the face of changes not seen in a century and a turbulent regional and international situation, China-Russia relations have maintained healthy and stable development and progressed steadily in the right direction,” Xi said. “Under our joint leadership, mutual political trust between the two sides has deepened, our strategic coordination has been strengthened, and mutually beneficial cooperation has continued to produce new results,” he added.\nPutin, a “good friend”\nThe volume of bilateral trade has exceeded $200 billion, ahead of targets, he further stressed. China, he said, looks forward to celebrating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral relations in 2024. During a visit to Beijing earlier in December by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Xi had said that maintaining close relations with Moscow was a “strategic choice.”\nThe two allies strengthened their ties as Western countries turned their backs on Moscow following the invasion of Ukraine. Both regimes also emphasize the importance of the personal relationship between the two leaders, with Xi calling Putin a “good friend.”\nRead more: \"The Crimes of Our Mother\" Netflix-Doku: American Woman Found Guilty of Murdering Her Children in Boise, Idaho\nNever miss any news\nTo stay informed on your favorite themes and not miss any news, subscribe to our newsletter and receive the essential news of the day directly in your mailbox every day.\n(AFP)\n1704025356\n#Diplomacy #Tie #Beijing #Moscow #strengthened",
