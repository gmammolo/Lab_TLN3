  "text": "Newly-elected Argentine President Javier Milei spoke on Thursday at the opening ceremony of the Pan American Maccabi Games, an international tournament for Jewish athletes.\nOver 10,000 people attended the two-hour event at Movistar Arena in Buenos Aires, located in the city's Villa Crespo neighborhood, which is traditionally associated with the local Jewish community.\nA handful of countries from outside of North and South America sent athlete delegations, including Australia, Great Britain, France and Zimbabwe. Israel's delegation – pared down in size due to the aftermath of the October 7 attacks – received a special welcome.\nNew President Milei, Argentina's Jews and Israel: A tricky triangle What’s Behind the Remarkable Surge in Aliyah From Argentina Hamas atrocities blur line between pro-Palestinian left, pro-Israel right in Latin America \"I want a warm greeting to all the Jewish people and in particular to those who have family or loved ones near the front lines,\" said Milei , referencing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. His comments drew multiple standing ovations.\n\"I accompany you in this difficult moment and I want to ratify at this moment my unalterable commitment to the state of Israel and to the Jewish people in their fight against Islamic terrorism, for peace and freedom,\" he continued.\nMilei also referenced the Hanukkah story, as he did in his inauguration speech, and added some words in Hebrew.\n\"Many times I have said that I did not come to guide lambs, but to awaken lions. I see in the Maccabean Games this spirit of excellence and courage,\" he said.\nOpen gallery view Milei lighting a Hanukkah menorah in Buenos Aires this month.

Her brother-in-law, Ruben Engel, was killed in the Hamas attacks.\nOther prominent attendees included Argentine Vice President Victoria Villaruel, the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors to Argentina, Marc Stanley and Eyal Sela, as well as the mayor of Buenos Aires, Jorge Macri.\n\"I have a lot of experience in Maccabi games, but this time was special. The entry of the Israeli delegation was… our heart exploded,\" said Riki Kanterevicz, Maccabi World Union's vice chairman and the chairman of Israel's delegation, in a TV interview. \"I want to thank the community that was in the stadium for this warm reception.\"\nMilei, a right-wing former economist who has already begun enacting sweeping changes to the country's financial system, is not Jewish — but he has a passionate interest in Judaism. He has talked about studying with a rabbi and potentially converting to the religion.\nFor his first trip abroad since being elected last month, the Argentine president visited the tomb of the Lubavitcher rebbe in New York.\nClick the alert icon to follow topics:\nArgentina\nJewish Diaspora\nIsrael sport",
