  "text": "BETHLEHEM, Pa. - The owners of a family-run bakery in Northampton County are no longer moving forward with plans to open a sister location in Bethlehem.\nThe operators of Let Them Eat Cake, a French Regency-inspired bakery offering elegant cakes, cupcakes, macarons and more at 112 S. Main St. in Nazareth, have decided not to move forward with opening a sister location - Let Them Drink Tea - in Bethlehem, according to an announcement on Let Them Eat Cake and Let Them Drink Tea's social media pages.\nIn early May, the owners announced plans to open Let Them Drink Tea - a tea room specializing in morning and afternoon tea - this summer at 306 Brodhead Ave. in south Bethlehem.\n\"After much thought and consideration, we have made the difficult decision not to move forward with opening Let Them Drink Tea in Bethlehem, PA,\" the announcement reads.\n\"We know this news may come as a disappointment to some, and we deeply appreciate the enthusiasm and support we've received. At this time, we kindly ask for understanding, kindness, and compassion as we navigate this transition. We will not be answering any questions at this time and thank you for respecting that boundary.\"\nLast month, co-owner Taylor Romero told 69 News that Let Them Drink Tea would be an extension of Let Them Eat Cake and operate in a similar fashion to the Nazareth location, but it wouldn't be an \"exact replica.\"\nRomero and her mother, Channon Smyly, debuted Let Them Eat Cake in June 2023 at its former location at 143 S. Main St. in Nazareth.\nLast year, the mother-daughter duo decided to move the bakery about 90 yards away from its original spot to its current 112 S. Main St. location to expand operations.\nLet Them Eat Cake operates at 112 S. Main St. in Nazareth.\nRyan Kneller In moving to the new space, new features were added to “amplify the experience” at Let Them Eat Cake.\nNew aspects include private parties; macaron technique and cake classes; and high tea experiences for individuals looking to “indulge in the finger things” with warm, artisanal teas and sweet and savory bites.\nOver the past year, the Let Them Eat Cake team has hosted various themed events such as princess tea parties, a Bridgerton-themed week and a Star Wars-inspired afternoon tea.\nThe high tea events have proven very popular, with the Nazareth bakery being fully booked nearly every week, Romero said.\nLet Them Eat Cake The Let Them Drink Tea venue in Bethlehem was intended to build on this popularity, with guests able to enjoy morning and afternoon teas, featuring an assortment of fine teas served alongside delicate pastries, scones, finger sandwiches and more.\nPlans for Let Them Drink Tea also included selling fresh baked goods such as brownies, cupcakes, macarons and scones, along with drinks such as French-pressed coffee and iced coffee.\nIn response to the Let Them Drink Tea announcement, community members are extending words of encouragement to the Let Them Eat Cake team.\n\"So sorry to hear this!\" one person commented on Let Them Eat Cake's Facebook post. \"Doesn't change how I feel as a customer, which is: You're Da Best!!!\"\n\"I'm just glad Let them Eat Cake will still be open,\" another person wrote. \"We love it!\"\nFor the latest Let Them Eat Cake updates, follow the business' pages on Facebook and Instagram .\nCLICK HERE for more Eat, Sip, Shop Facebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
