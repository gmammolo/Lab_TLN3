  "text": "\"We will liberate and win!\" Nayev congratulated the military on New Year holidays. Video The Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Serhiy Nayev addressed the servicemen on the occasion of the New Year. The lieutenant general noted that the past year was not easy, but Ukraine has survived and continues to move forward. He also assured that the Ukrainian army will definitely liberate the occupied territories and end this war with a victory over Russia. Nayev posted his New Year's address on [Telegram.](https://t.me/SerhiyNaiev/172) According to him, in 2023, Ukrainian defenders did a lot to bring the victory over the enemy closer. He emphasized the effectiveness of mobile fire groups, which were created in a short time, equipped with weapons and trained to hit air targets. In addition, Nayev noted that in 2023, long-term fortifications were created in dangerous areas of the border. Also, tens of kilometers of minefields and mined rubble were installed, and hundreds of thousands of meters of trenches and anti-tank ditches were dug. \"Contrary to all the skeptics' predictions, Ukraine has not fallen, but is stubbornly defending its historical right to a full-fledged free existence in the civilized world. We will definitely liberate the occupied territories and end this terrible war with victory,\" Nayev said. As a reminder, Nayev said that Ukrainian soldiers from combat units in the Northern Operational Zone [received items necessary for their combat work](https://war.obozrevatel.com/ukr/vognevi-grupi-ppo-otrimali-onovlennya-yake-dopomozhe-krasche-polyuvati-na-shahedi-vnochi.htm), as well as gifts that keep people's hearts warm. Earlier, Serhiy Nayev showed how Ukrainian defenders near the border with Belarus are practicing their readiness to repel the enemy. He noted that the situation is calm now, but it [can change](https://war.obozrevatel.com/ukr/ne-privid-rozslablyatisya-gotovnist-ukrainskih-voiniv-zustriti-voroga-na-pivnochi-pokazali-na-video.htm) at any time.
