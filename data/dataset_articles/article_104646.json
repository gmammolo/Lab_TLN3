  "text": "Politics2023-December-31 17:53\nLeader: General Soleimani Saved Resistance Front in Region\nTEHRAN (FNA)- Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei underlined that the revival of the Resistance Front was the most important service of Martyr Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani in the region.\nDuring the meeting with the family of martyr Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani on Sunday, Ayatollah Khamenei said that martyr Soleimani made a great effort to revive the Resistance Front and did so with sincerity, wisdom, and morals.\n\"Revival of the Resistance front in the region was the most important role and service of Martyr Soleimani,\" Iran's Supreme Leader said in the meeting.\nAyatollah Khamenei lauded the struggles of the Resistance forces in recent months, and said, \"Martyr Soleimani made a lot of efforts to revive the Resistance Front and he carried out this work with the same sincerity and wisdom and ethics.\"\nAyatollah Khamenei praised and appreciated the efforts of the IRGC Quds Force commander, Brigadier General Esmail Qaani, and said, \" The path of strengthening the Resistance Front should be continued.\"\nIn this meeting, Zainab Soleimani briefed the Leader on the measures taken regarding the transfer of thoughts of Martyr Soleimani to the young generation.\nLieutenant General Soleimani, his Iraqi trenchmate Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, the second-in-command of Iraq’s PMU, and ten of their deputies were martyred by an armed drone strike that was directly ordered by the White House as their convoy left Baghdad International Airport on January 3, 2020.\nBoth commanders were highly revered across the Middle East because of their key role in fighting the Daesh (also known as ISIL or ISIS) Takfiri terrorist group in the region, particularly in Iraq and Syria.\nIranian officials have repeatedly emphasized that Tehran will certainly take revenge from the masterminds and perpetrators of the terror attack on the anti-terror icon. Tehran stresses Americans and Zionists rest assured that it is serious about revenge for the assassination of Martyr Soleimani, and they continue to live under the shadow of Iran's reprisal since they don't know when and where they come under attack.\nOn January 8, the the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) targeted the US-run Ein Al-Assad in Iraq’s Western province of Al-Anbar by launching a volley of missiles in retaliation. According to the Pentagon, at least 110 American forces suffered “traumatic brain injuries” during the counterstrike on the base. Iran has described the missile attack as a “first slap\".\nIran has asked Interpol to issue a red notice for all perpetrators and masterminds of the assassination of Lieut. Gen. Soleimani. Tehran has also identified dozens of people in connection with the targeted terror attack and that includes Trump, Pentagon officials and American forces in the region. The Iranian Foreign Ministry has also declared sanctions against several persons - including Trump, Pompeo and former National Security Advisor John Bolton - who have ordered, perpetrated or cooperated in the assassination of Lieutenant General Soleimani.\nBack in May,Tehran’s Prosecutor General Ali Salehi issued arrest warrants for dozens of former and present US officials, including Trump, Pompeo and former Head of the CENTCOM General Kenneth Franklin McKenzie for their involvement in the assassination of the anti-terror hero.",
