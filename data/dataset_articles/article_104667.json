The film delves into the emotional and ethical dilemmas astronauts encounter in such high-stakes situations, showcasing vulnerability as a source of strength rather than weakness.\nDeBose’s Approach to Character Development\nDeBose draws from real-life astronauts and engineers to authentically portray Dr. Kira Foster, infusing the character with a sense of realism and depth. She emphasizes the importance of understanding the emotional and psychological journey of her character, highlighting the complexities of decision-making and the human experience in space.\nBreaking Barriers in Sci-Fi Storytelling\nDeBose’s involvement in “I.S.S.” marks a significant step in diversifying and humanizing sci-fi storytelling.
