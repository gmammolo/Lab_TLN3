  "text": "VENICE — Tania Vitvitsky spent months traveling around Ukraine, focusing her camera on the “beautiful” people there rather than the atrocities of war they have faced. Vitvitsky joined Branch 56 of the Ukrainian National Women’s League to present a slideshow about a her recent journey to Ukraine. As president of the Ukrainian Charitable Platform, she wanted to share what she learned. On her journey, she soaked up the culture and resilience of the Ukrainian people. But getting there wasn’t easy. All passenger flights remain restricted due to the ongoing war with Russia, which is nearing its two-year mark. She visited Lviv, a city in the Western side of Ukraine, which she left at 3 years of age. To get there, she had to fly into Warsaw, Poland, and travel via train. Although Lviv is distanced from much of the violence, the impacts of the war are still palpable and “everyone is involved,” Vitvitsky said. She presented a video she took at a park with various people walking around, mingling. In the background, however, an air-raid warning siren blared. The people in the park were not reacting to it. Sirens like the one in the video went off every other day, according to Vitvitsky. Ukraine has seen one-third of its population ousted from their homes, Vitvitsky said. “Imagine if that was here,” Vitvitsky said. “That would be over 100 million people displaced.” Vitvitsky then showed a photo she took of a group of children taking refuge in an underground bunker. “Look at their faces,” she said. “They don’t even look scared, and that’s not a good thing.” Once the sirens turn off, life turns back on and everyday life resumes. Vitvitsky presented various landmarks across the city and the ever-present nightlife that even included live music. Each attraction had numerous Ukrainians going about their lives. Some showed soldiers visiting their families and friends, according to Vitvitsky. “Every single person is affected by the war,” she said, then showing people rummaging together supplies in an effort to help those on the front lines. “But we can’t forget, you need to live, too,” Vitvitsky said.
