  "text": "OneFootball\nPeter Fitzpatrick·18 January 2024\nOneFootball\nPeter Fitzpatrick·18 January 2024\nNapoli kept their hopes of a trophy alive this season with a 3-0 victory over\n[Fiorentina](/en/team/fiorentina-15) in the Italian Super Cup semi-final.\nRead all about it here.\nScorers: Simeone 22′, Zerbin 84′, 86′\nIn front of a half-empty Al-Awwal Stadium,\n[Fiorentina](/en/team/fiorentina-15) dominated the ball in the opening minutes but struggled to create any chances of note.\nNapoli, on the other hand, had less of the ball but more of the attacks, Matteo Politano having his deflected shot tipped over the bar by Pietro Terracciano.\nThe Serie A champions took the lead in the 22nd minute with a quite brilliant goal. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia showed great strenght to hold off\n[Fiorentina](/en/team/fiorentina-15) defender Nikola Milenković and flick the ball onto Juan Jesus.\nThe Brazilian then played the ball towards Giovanni Simeone, who beat Terracciano with an angled drive.\nLa\n[Viola](/en/team/fiorentina-15), and Jonathan Ikoné to be specific, wasted a golden opportunity to draw level right before half-time. The French forward won a penalty for his side after being fouled by Mario Rui, but proceeded to fire the ball high over the bar from 12 yards out.\nThe second half was much of the same with\n[Fiorentina](/en/team/fiorentina-15) having most of the ball but not truly threatening the [Napoli](/en/team/napoli-191) defence.\nNapoli sealed the win and their place in the Super Cup final with two late goals from substitute Alessio Zerbin, who only came on in the 82nd minute.\nOn 84 minutes, a Giovanni Di Lorenzo corner was flicked onto the backpost where the striker was on hand to stretch out and finish, before crashing into the post.\nHe dusted himself down to put the game to bed two minutes later, finishing with a low drilled shot after being played into position.\nNapoli will find out their final opponents when Inter Milan and Lazio face off tomorrow in the other semi-final.",
