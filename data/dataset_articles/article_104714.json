  "text": "AG100, a new-generation trainer aircraft made by Aviation Industry Corp of China, began to be delivered to users on Friday.\nAt a delivery ceremony at AG100's manufacturing complex in Deqing, Zhejiang province, six AG100s were delivered to representatives from two buyers－Henan New Silk Road Flight College and Zhuhai AVIC Flight School.\nIn the next several weeks, these planes will undergo necessary checks and are scheduled to enter formal operation in March, according to project managers.\nBuilt by the Zhejiang China Aviation Industry General Aircraft Institute, a subsidiary of AVIC General Aircraft, the AG100 is a model of a light-weight basic training plane for civilian flight students.\nThe three-seat plane is mainly made with low-cost composite materials and uses gasoline as fuel.\nThe aircraft features advanced technologies, good operational economy, easy maintenance and high safety, which makes it fit to be flown by entry-level aviators, according to its designers.\nThe research and development of AG100 started in April 2017. The type conducted its maiden flight in June 2020 and has since then flown hundreds of hours to test its capability and reliability.\nIn November 2023, the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued the type certificate to AG100. At the end of last year, the administration gave a production certificate to the plane, permitting the large-scale manufacturing.\nAccording to specifications published by AVIC, the training plane is 7.26 meters long with a wingspan of 10.42 meters. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 975 kilograms, a flight ceiling of 4.3 kilometers, and can carry one trainer and two students.\nThe type has a cruising speed of 257 km per hour and a top flight range of 1,000 km.",
