  "text": "Wolfspeed will be taken over by creditors including Apollo Global Management under a proposal that would put the struggling chipmaker into bankruptcy, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the plan.\nThe company will soon announce a deal for a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy, that would be long enough to slash billions in debt, the report said. After a restructuring support agreement is signed, Wolfspeed will ask creditors to vote on the plan and then file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nShares of Wolfspeed, which makes chips using silicon carbide — a more energy-efficient material than traditional silicon, rose about 3% to $1.29 on Wednesday. The stock had fallen about 81% so far this year.\nWolfspeed and Apollo did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nThe chipmaker raised going-concern doubts earlier in May, as deepening economic uncertainty stemming from changing U.S. trade policies, combined with weakening demand, triggered a series of financial challenges for the company.\nAs of March, the company had about $1.33 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and about $6.5 billion of debt obligations, it said in a regulatory filing in May.\nIn a prepackaged bankruptcy, companies and their creditors agree on a reorganization plan prior to the bankruptcy filing and creditors even vote on the plan.\nShareholders could recover as much as 5% in the proposed scenario, the report said. In a typical bankruptcy, shareholders are usually wiped out because creditors must be paid first, and there often is not enough value left for equity holders.\nIn 2023, Wolfspeed announced $1.25 billion in debt financing led by Apollo, with the option to increase the total to as much as $2 billion to support the company’s U.S. expansion plans.
