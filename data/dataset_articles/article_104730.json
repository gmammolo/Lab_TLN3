  "text": "By Kazeem Ugbodaga\nThe Super Eagles of Nigeria have defeated the Elephant of Cote d’Ivoire 1-o to brighten their chances of qualifying for AFCON knockout stage.\nWilliam Troost-Ekong converted a penalty in the 55th minute of the game to give the Eagles the much needed win.\nTroost-Ekong won the battle of wills and sent an unstoppable penalty past Yahia Fofana into middle of the goal.\nEarlier in the eighth minute, Victor Osimhen made a yard for himself inside the box after an accurate pass and took a shot that went just over the crossbar.\nA minute later, Christian Kouame had a great chance inside the six-yard box, shot to the middle of the goal, but Stanley Nwabili pulled off an exquisite save to deny him.\nIn the 31st minute, Seko Fofana wasted an opportunity. He found himself in acres of space and fired in a terrific shot from long range straight towards the right side of the target, but the goalkeeper made a brilliant save.\nIn the 62nd minute, Osimhen wasted a chance to score. He pinged a fine header from deep inside the box towards the net, but his aim was off and it flew narrowly wide of the right post.\nIn the 73rd minute, Seko Fofana received a precise pass on the edge of the box and released a promising effort. Unfortunately for him, his strike flew painfully close to the right post.\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info).",
