  "text": "2024-01-19 08:31:00 Kremlin troops “not effective” NATO admiral sees “significant Ukrainian successes” Jan 19, 2024, 9:31 a.m. Listen to article This audio version was artificially generated. More info | Send feedback The failed summer offensive by the Ukrainian armed forces and the minimal advance of Russian troops give the impression that Moscow’s troops have the upper hand on the battlefield. However, NATO does not believe these successes have had a major impact. The chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, assesses the current fighting in Ukraine as “fierce”. “Russia’s recent attacks are devastating, but not militarily effective,” Bauer said at a press conference after a meeting with Ukrainian Major General Salkutsan. “At the same time, we are seeing significant military successes on the Ukrainian side.” Bauer assumes more than 300,000 Russian deaths and injuries. The Ukrainian troops also destroyed thousands of tanks and armored vehicles as well as hundreds of aircraft. “They were able to liberate significant parts of their territory and push the Russians back from around 50 percent of the areas occupied at the beginning of the war,” said Bauer. Another advantage was that the Ukrainians were able to carry out “severe attacks to destroy important Russian capabilities.” “The fact that Ukraine, without a real navy, was able to push back the Russian Black Sea Fleet and open a grain corridor is another big win.” NATO: Negotiated solution through a strong Ukraine The only way to a lasting negotiated solution is to strengthen Ukraine’s position on the battlefield, Bauer said. The Kremlin, on the other hand, is said to be of the opinion, according to the Institute for War Studies (ISW), “that Russia can occupy more territory the longer the war lasts, and that the course of the war will increasingly weaken Ukraine’s negotiating position,” as it said in a statement Analysis is called. Despite the NATO admiral’s positive assessment of the course of the war for Ukraine, Kiev is also struggling with high casualties of soldiers and military equipment as well as exhausted troops. They are also constantly reporting that their motivation is dwindling due to the lack of ammunition at the front. It is currently suspected that the Kremlin troops could soon increase their offensive efforts. “A key indication is that the Russian regional commands along the front are obviously trying to pull together additional forces,” said military expert Colonel Reisner to ntv.de. The deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Vadym Skibitskyi, recently stated the number of Kremlin troops in his country at 462,000. “Ukraine needs a change in strategy from important supporters” The Ukrainian armed forces have increasingly gone on the defensive in recent weeks and have massively expanded their defenses along the front. The goal of Kiev’s military is to gain air superiority this year, including through the new F-16 fighter jets from the West. Ukraine is currently trying to get 45 helicopters from Australia that have been decommissioned there. Technological advances, such as jamming enemy drones, should also help push back the Russian occupiers. There is still hope for a delivery of Taurus long-range missiles from Germany. “Ukraine needs a change of strategy from important supporters. With help for military assertiveness instead of pure survival and long-term security commitments including the prospect of NATO membership, a path to peace would be possible in 2024,” writes military expert Nico Lange on X. 1705656578 #Kremlin #troops #effective #NATO #admiral #sees #significant #Ukrainian #successes",
