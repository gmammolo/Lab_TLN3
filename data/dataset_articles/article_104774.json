  "text": "Israel's Defense Systems Demonstrated in Eilat Interceptions\nMichael Doran Highlights Unity Among Israelis and Division Among Elites Over War Effort\nThe recent war effort in Israel has sparked an intriguing societal dynamic, as observed by Michael Doran, a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute. During his ten-day visit to the country, Doran noted a remarkable unity among the Israeli populace in support of their nation’s actions. However, a stark contrast emerges within the Israeli elite, with opinions on the war effort starkly divided.\nThe Paradox of Unity and Division\nIn an interview with Sky News Australia host James Morrow, Doran described the situation as a series of paradoxes that have taken root within Israeli society. While there is robust support for the war among the general population, the elite circles have been embroiled in heated debates and divisions over the same issue. This dichotomy paints a fascinating picture of the current state of affairs in Israel.\nA Tumultuous Time for Prime Minister Netanyahu\nThese observations coincide with a challenging period for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose approval ratings are experiencing a significant decline. Current polls suggest a mere 15 percent of Israelis are in favor of Netanyahu continuing his term in office. This marked drop in support poses a severe challenge for the Prime Minister’s political survival.\nInternational Pressure and Domestic Discord\nNetanyahu’s tumbling popularity comes in the wake of escalating tension between the US and Israel. Reports indicate that President Biden’s patience with Netanyahu is wearing thin, following the Prime Minister’s rejection of the US’s requests to scale back Israel’s military offensive in Gaza and take steps towards establishing a Palestinian state post-war. This friction, coupled with growing international criticism over Netanyahu’s handling of the war, only serves to deepen the rift within Israeli society.\nAs Israel navigates this turbulent period, the dynamic between unity and division within its society, as highlighted by Doran, will continue to shape the nation’s trajectory. The implications of this societal dynamic, particularly on the political future of Netanyahu, remain to be seen.\nComments\nSubscribe to BNN Breaking\nSign up for our daily newsletter covering global breaking news around the world.\n[]https://bnnbreaking.com/politics/rahul-gandhi-clarifies-adivasi-and-vanvasi-distinction-criticizes-bjp-and-pledges-indigenous-empowerment/",
