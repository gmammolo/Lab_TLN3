Despite a challenging situation, the hosts, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips, rescued their team, securing victory with 11 balls to spare.\nHaving been asked to bat first, Pakistan posted a total of 158/5 in 20 overs. Rizwan's dazzling 63-ball 90 and a quick cameo of 21* runs by Mohammad Nawaz contributed to a respectable score. However, Pakistan's middle-order struggled to accelerate, going almost seven overs without a boundary after the powerplay. Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson claimed two wickets each for the Black Caps, while Adam Milne secured one.\nChasing 158, New Zealand faced an early setback, losing three wickets quickly and finding themselves at 20/3 in the third over. Finn Allen, Tim Seifert, and Will Young fell victim to Pakistani skipper Shaheen Afridi. Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips initiated a rescue mission, displaying sensible play to maintain a steady scoring rate and accelerating when necessary. Despite Pakistan's efforts, the bowlers couldn't break the partnership. The duo's unbeaten 139-run stand led New Zealand to victory by 7 wickets with 11 balls to spare. Mitchell concluded with an unbeaten 44-ball 72, while Phillips remained unbeaten with a 52-ball 70.\nShaheen Afridi stood out with the ball for Pakistan, claiming all three wickets that fell during the innings.\nAlso Read: Sachin Tendulkar's all-round performance steals the show in Bangalore (WATCH)",
