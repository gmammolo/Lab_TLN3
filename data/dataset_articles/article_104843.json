  "text": "ISLAMABAD:\nThe political leadership of the country lauded the professionalism of the Pakistani armed forces that targeted the terrorist hideouts in the Sistan-Baluchistan province of Iran, while avoiding civilian casualties in the early hours of Thursday.\nPakistan conducted an intelligence-based operation inside Iran, carrying out effective strikes against terrorist hideouts, responsible for the recent attacks in the country. The operation was carried out over a day after Tehran said it attacked the bases of another terrorist group within the Pakistani territory.\nPresident Dr Arif Alvi, in a statement, lauded the professionalism of the armed forces, while avoiding civilian casualties in the strikes. However, he made it clear that Pakistan would not compromise on its national security and territorial integrity and would take all necessary measures to defend its soil.\n“Terrorism is a common challenge that requires global efforts for its elimination,” Alvi said. “Pakistan and Iran are brotherly countries and they need to resolve issues through dialogue and mutual consultation.”\nFormer president and Pakistan Peoples Party Co-chairman Asif Zardari said if any country casts an evil eye towards Pakistan, it would be given an effective response.\nIn a statement, he said that Pakistan was a peace-loving country, but those who attacked Pakistan must think twice.\n“We have always talked about peace in the world and have always worked to maintain peace in the world. We want good relations with our neighbours but only on the basis of equality. Pakistan Army is the best army in the world and our forces know how to defend the country very well,” he said.\nFormer prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif praised the military for carrying out ‘Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar’ targeting terrorist hideouts in Iran.\nRead also:\nExperts condemn Iran's missile attack on Pakistan\nHe said in post shared on X, the social media platform, that Pakistan had the right to defend itself.\n“Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the well-being of our citizens are paramount. Pakistan has taken fitting diplomatic and military steps for peace and security,” he wrote.\nAt the same time, he also spoke about having peaceful relations between the countries.\nFormer defence minister and a senior PML-N leader Khawaja Asif, while calling for peaceful relations between the neighbours, stated that Iran had overstepped and didn’t utilise the available options in conducting air strikes in Balochistan.\n“The [Pakistani] response was necessary,” Asif noted.\nPPP Senator Sherry Rehman said the targeted strikes on the terrorist hideouts had delivered the message to Iran that Pakistan could not remain silent. However, she added that Pakistan would respond in the same fashion if Iran came forward with a message of friendship.\nIn an informal conversation with the media at the Adiala Jail courtroom, former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan strongly denounced Iran's violation of Pakistan's airspace while urging an investigation into the circumstances.\nRead:\nImran calls for introspection after Iran strikes\nIn a separate statement, PTI spokesperson termed the airstrikes inside Iran were essential to ensure sovereignty, national security, and territorial integrity of Pakistan. “Pakistan being a sovereign state has all the right to respond to any external aggression in the most effective and befitting manner.\nThe spokesperson said that Pakistan's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security were of utmost importance; hence no compromise would be made in this regard.\n“The PTI stands firmly with the armed forces in the face of any foreign aggression to defend and guard the motherland.”\nTaking to social media, PML-N Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz said, “We all pay tribute to the Pakistani forces for giving a befitting response to the attack on Pakistan's sovereignty.\n“Timely action based on confidential information and professional competence is commendable.”\nMeanwhile, the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) condemned the violation of Pakistani borders by Iran.\nSHCBA President Rehan Malik said that Iran's behaviour was also a violation of international laws.\nHe expressed condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the attack.",
