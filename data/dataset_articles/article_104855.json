  "text": "It seems that the administration of President Joe Biden ably supported by a know-nothing bought Congress leans over backwards to make sure that it never is tempted to do the right thing for the American people. I am not necessarily talking about Genocide Joe’s regrettable interactions with our favorite comedian pretending to be a head of state Volodymyr Zelensky or with Israel’s despicable Benjamin Netanyahu, but rather am thinking about the instances where the government might act to benefit an American and instead does nothing but sit on its hands, metaphorically speaking, and exhibit instead a vacant, self-satisfied grin.\nI am particularly thinking\nof the death of Chilean-American journalist Gonzalo Lira that took place on January 11th at a hospital in Kharkov in Ukraine. Lira has been living in Ukraine and it has been suggested that he has a Ukrainian wife and children. He has written three novels and is a regular poster with videos and articles on YouTube under the user name Coach Red Pill, where he has obtained a considerable audience as a truth teller. He also has appeared on alternative news shows to include Tucker Carlson, who announced on his page on X the news of Lira’s death. Lira had developed into a prominent and reliable commentator on the Russia-Ukraine war and was arrested and imprisoned for speaking and writing on conflict related issues critical of the Volodymyr Zelensky government. Lira reportedly had made no friends in the Ukrainian government when he accurately called Ukraine’s leader a “cokehead,” and perhaps hyperbolically described the Russian operation as “one of the most brilliant invasions in military history.”",
