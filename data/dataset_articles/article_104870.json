  "text": "Britain has conducted new trials of the DragonFire long-range directed energy laser weapon, successfully targeting multiple aerial objects, the UK Ministry of Defence reported on Friday. As reported by The Times, the system, positioned at different locations and at a distance of several kilometers, destroyed approaching drones. “During tests at the military range on the Hebrides, the DragonFire directed energy laser weapon system successfully carried out the UK’s first powerful laser firing at aerial targets,” the ministry’s statement, published on the government’s website, said. The range of DragonFire is classified, but the ministry stated that the system is a line-of-sight weapon capable of striking “any visible target.” This stage of testing demonstrated DragonFire’s ability to engage aerial targets at relevant distances, marking a significant step toward the adoption of this technology for military use. The British Army and Royal Navy are considering deploying this weapon within their air defense capabilities, according to the statement. Grant Shapps, the head of the UK Ministry of Defence, stated that such advanced weaponry could “radically alter the battlefield” by reducing dependence on costly ammunition and minimizing collateral damage. As indicated by the defense ministry, the cost of firing one shot from the laser weapon typically amounts to less than £10, while generating as much heat in 10 seconds as a conventional heater would in an hour of use.",
