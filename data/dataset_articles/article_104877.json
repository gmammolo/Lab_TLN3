  "text": "This would have not happened if it were not for the strong Palestinian Resistance throughout Gaza. According to NBC News, the Biden Administration is [beginning](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/frustrations-biden-israeli-pm-netanyahu-mount-rcna134263) to recognize that there is no military solution to the Israeli war on Gaza. The realization arrived belatedly for tens of thousands of Palestinians who have lost their lives or were wounded in the Israeli quest of destroying the Resistance, in fact, all of Gaza. But the US shift would have not happened if it were not for the stiff, in fact powerful, Palestinian Resistance throughout the Gaza Strip, even in the northern region, which Israel had allegedly ‘pacified’ weeks ago. On today’s roundup of the Resistance operations on the 104th day of the Israeli war, Al-Qassam Brigades speak of killing and wounding over 40 Israeli soldiers in various fighting axes. Below are the latest statements by the two main Resistance forces in Gaza, and the Lebanese Resistance Movement Hezbollah. The statements below were communicated via their Telegram channels and are published here in their original form. Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas) “After our fighters returned from the areas of clashes, they confirmed that a Zionist force stationed in a house was targeted with an anti-fortification TBG shell, killing 5 of its members, east of the city of Khan Yunis, south of the Gaza Strip. “After returning from the combat fronts, our fighters confirmed the explosion of a house that was previously rigged with several explosive devices targeting a Zionist infantry force consisting of 30 soldiers. The soldiers were lured into the house, and as soon as they entered, the house was completely detonated, resulting in deaths and injuries among them in Bani Suheila, east of Khan Yunis city in the southern Gaza Strip. “Al-Qassam fighters were able to target two Merkava tanks and a D9 military bulldozer with Al-Yassin 105 shells in the Abasan area, east of the city of Khan Yunis. “Al-Qassam Brigades target a Zionist troop carrier at the Al-Khalil military site, east of Al-Tuffah neighborhood, with an Al-Yassin 105 shell. “Al-Qassam fighters targeted a Zionist troop carrier on Jabal al-Rayyis, east of Al-Tuffah neighborhood, with an Al-Yassin 105 shell, and clashed with soldiers who were around it, leaving them dead and wounded. In this just-released video, Al-Qassam fighters are seen targeting an Israeli force holed up inside a building in Jabaliya al-Balad, northern Gaza Strip.
