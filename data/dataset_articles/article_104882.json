  "text": "Football has a fickle memory. It thrives in the present and often, changes for a better future.\nThat was what Japan coach Hajime Moriyasu had suggested in the pre-match press conference before its clash against Iraq in the AFC Asian Cup 2023, at the Education City Stadium on Friday.\nThe last time Japan played Iraq in Qatar, a 2-2 draw at the Jassim bin Hamad Stadium in 1993 had broken dreams of playing its maiden FIFA World Cup. “Most of the players in the current squad were not even born when the match was played,” Moriyasu had said, “that game is past now.”\nBut ghastly memories of that three-decade-old match came back to haunt the Samurai Blue as Iraq rode on raucous fan support and clinical attacking to beat Japan 2-1 in its second group-stage game.\nBoth goals came off Aymen Hussein’s head, who was subbed off at half-time in what looked like a problem in his right hamstring.\nALSO READ: South Korea keeper Kim ruled out of competition with knee injury\nThis was the first win since 1982 for the Central Asian side against the four-time Asian champion when it had beaten Japan 1-0 at the Asian Games.\nIraq created overloads in Japan’s half right from kick-off, mirroring Japan’s start against Vietnam in its first game. In that match, Moriyasu’s side had opened the scoring within 11 minutes.\nIraq, under Jesus Garcia, drew first blood even quicker.\nIn the fifth minute, Ahmed Yahya Al-Hajjaj’s through ball was received by Ali Jasim Elaibi on the left flank, who put his foot on the gas to maraud along the left flank and deliver a cross.\nThough Zion Suzuki, Japan’s goalkeeper, pushed the ball out, it fell for Aymen Hussein, who headed the ball in causing an eruption of joy in the stadium.\nThe 38,663 fans at the stadium, most of whom were Iraqi, made the air crackle with Viking claps, regional songs and chants of “Iraq!” and made sure a trailing Japan remained on the backfoot with whistles and boos every time it had the ball.\nIRAQ 🇮🇶 is in the #AsianCup2023 Round of 16 #HayyaAsia pic.twitter.com/Ia8f1sJKsb\n— AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023 (@Qatar2023en) January 19, 2024",
