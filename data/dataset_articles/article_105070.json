  "text": "Service & Sacrifice: Keeping Us Safe\nA snapshot of the burdens being shouldered by brave U.S. troops and military families around the world.\nMiddle East\nAs\nchaos continues in the Middle East, more than 1,500 U.S. military service members are headed to the troubled region to fight terrorism.\nEarlier this week, a large ceremony was held at a sports arena in Trenton, New Jersey, to bid farewell to the state’s deploying National Guard soldiers. The brave men and women in uniform will be tasked with fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq, where Iran-backed terrorist groups have\nlaunched well over 100 attacks since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel in October.\n“It is the largest deployment of New Jersey Army National Guard soldiers since 2008,” according to U.S. Central Command.\nOne of the departing soldiers is Lt. Col. Omar Minott, who\nspoke to CBS Philadelphia about how his deployment will impact his loved ones.\n“With a two-parent household, having me leave is a challenge with our four kids,” Lt. Col. Minott told the TV station. “But my wife is … she’s pretty strong.”\nPlease join The Stream in praying for the safety of these 1,500-plus soldiers and the well-being of their families here at home. America is grateful for your selfless service and willingness to confront the evils of terrorism.\nPlease Support The Stream: Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political, Economic, and Moral Issues of Our Day. []()\nNothing could demonstrate the sacrifices of our military more than this week’s news that two U.S. Navy SEALs went missing off the coast of Somalia.\nThe SEALs, who went missing last Thursday, “were boarding an un-flagged vessel at night when one fell into the ocean. Another SEAL jumped in to rescue him,”\naccording to KPBS. Iranian missiles were later found by the SEAL team upon boarding the ship, which was bound for Yemen.\n“That effort it is ongoing,” U.S. Air Force Gen. Pat Ryder said about the search for the missing SEALs during a Wednesday news conference at the Pentagon. “Certainly, you know, we hope that we are able to recover our teammates. Our thoughts and prayers are clearly with their families at this time.”\nAs we pray for the safety of the missing SEALs, the U.S. military is pounding terrorist targets in Yemen, where the Iranian-backed Houthis have been launching attacks on U.S. Navy and commercial ships in the Red Sea. According to the military, American ships and submarines took out 14 Iranian missiles during Wednesday’s wave of counterattacks.\n“The actions by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways,” said Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla in a statement\nposted on X. “We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners and we will always protect our people.”\nPlease continue to pray for our nation’s valiant troops and their families.\nComing Home\nA squadron of U.S. Navy pilots returned to their Virginia Beach base earlier this week after spending eight long months patrolling the Mediterranean Sea.\nWelcome home, heroes! Thanks to you and your families for sacrificing so much to keep our country safe.\nTom Sileo is a contributing senior editor of The Stream.
