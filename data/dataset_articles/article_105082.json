  "text": "The United Kingdom achieved a first in the testing firing of a high-power laser weapon against a hovering target. The trial is being conducted in the hopes that it will lead to the development of a less expensive weapon capable of taking down targets such as drones. In a report by [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68031257), the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that the DragonFire weapon can accurately strike a coin from a distance of one kilometer. Taking place at Hebrides Range in Scotland, it was hailed as a significant milestone in deploying the technology. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said that technology can potentially lessen the need for costly weapons and the likelihood of collateral harm. The Laser Weapon System Some missiles may cost millions of pounds, whereas the drones they kill can only cost a few thousand. Therefore, the problem is that the missiles can be far more expensive than the drones they destroy. The cost of running the DragonFire system is usually less than £10 (about $12) per shot, and according to the MoD, firing it for 10 seconds is the same as using a normal heater for an hour. Notably, laser-directed energy weapons (LDEWs) can hit targets at the speed of light by using an intense light beam. Although its precise range remains a mystery, the DragonFire system can reportedly attack any discernible target within its designated line-of-sight range. The MoD is enlisting the help of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and a few private companies in its development. \"These trials have seen us take a huge step forward in [realizing] the potential opportunities and understanding the threats posed by directed energy weapons,\" said Dr. Paul Hollinshead, DSTL chief executive. A combined investment of £100 million ($127 million) by both the MoD and industry has produced the DragonFire weapon system.

The Army and Royal Navy are reportedly looking at incorporating the laser weapon technology into their future air defense capabilities, too. In the midst of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the usage of drones has been on the rise. Rumors have circulated that Russia has been [using \"kamikaze\" drones](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-62225830) manufactured in Iran to launch attacks on Ukrainian cities. This rise in use coincides with the development of laser weaponry. Similarly to how other countries utilize \"kamikaze\" drones, Ukraine has assembled its own army of drones and is already using recreational drones for military operations.
