  "text": "The 436th Operation Support Squadron’s 1C0X2 team poses for a group photo at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, Jan. 18, 2024. The team recently won the Air Mobility Command Sgt. Dee Campbell Aviation Resource Management Large Unit Team of the Year Award. The team showcased direct operational support of the unit mission by initiating crews for the strategic airlift of two MQ-8C unmanned helicopters, facilitating the deployment of an airborne mine detection prototype across 50 partner nations during the second-largest naval exercise. The team also generated 732 flight authorizations, verified 15,000 flight and ground requirements, facilitated 473 combat sorties and 1,300 flight hours supporting Operation Spartan Shield, which transported over 32 million pounds of cargo and 1,200 passengers.
