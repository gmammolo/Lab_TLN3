  "text": "[Advertise](/advertise)| [Contact Us](/contact)| [About Us](/about)| [Search](/search) NEW YORK (January 19) Gold price (XAU/USD) rises further on Friday’s European session as the appeal for safe-haven assets improves due to the deepening Middle East conflict. Adding to the war in Gaza, tensions between Houthi rebels and the United States military are increasing in the key commercial shipping route crossing the Red Sea. Moreover, Pakistan carried out military strikes in Iran on Thursday following a similar attack by Iran in its territory. In this context, the precious metal has recovered significantly, but the outlook in the near term has not turned bullish as further upside looks capped by diminishing bets supporting an interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed.) The outlook for inflation in the United States remains uncertain. Price growth is gradually declining, but recent data suggests that the economy is strong, particularly due to robust household spending. This adds to inflation pressures and makes it more likely that the Fed will maintain a restrictive [monetary policy](https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar/united-states) stance for a longer period. The Fed is expected to keep interest [rates](https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/rates) unchanged in the range of 5.25%-5.50% for the fourth consecutive time at the monetary policy meeting on January 31. Market participants will focus on the commentary about how the [Fed](https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed) will fit the expected three interest rate cuts in the remaining seven policy meetings of 2024.
