  "text": "The Indian Navy has come to the rescue of a U.S. ship crew in the Gulf of Aden following an attack by the Houthi group from Yemen.\nHouthi Trade Disruptions In Backdrop\nThese incidents are part of a series of Houthi assaults on trade ships in the Red Sea, leading to disruptions in vital sea routes and impacting global trade, according to reports from Reuters and U.S. News.\nHouthi Attack On The Genco Picardy\nLate on Wednesday, the Houthi group targeted the Genco Picardy, triggering a swift response from the U.S. military, which launched strikes on 14 Houthi missiles.\nRead More:\nThese “Trump” Stocks Could Take Off if He’s Re-elected\nMany Such Attacks\nThis attack is just one of many in a series that the Houthis have conducted in and around the Red Sea since November.\nHouthi Threat To Global Trade\nThe Houthi militia, known for its alignment with Iran, has been focusing its attacks on ships in the Red Sea, directly affecting trade routes connecting Asia and Europe.\nSupporting Palestine\nThe Houthis claim to support Palestinians in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, and they have threatened to target U.S. ships in retaliation for actions taken by the United States and the United Kingdom.\nAlso Read:\nGOP Presidential Candidate Arrested on Federal Tax Charges\nIn response to the crisis, India swiftly diverted a warship already deployed in the region to rescue the 22 crew members aboard the Genco Picardy, which included nine Indians.\nAll Crew Members Safe\nFortunately, all crew members were reported as safe, and a fire on the vessel had been successfully extinguished. The Houthi group claimed that their missiles had scored a “direct hit” on the bulk carrier.\nDisruptions In Global Trade Routes\nThese repeated attacks on shipping routes in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, accounting for approximately 15% of global shipping traffic, have far-reaching consequences for global trade.\nRead More:\nNorth Korea Fires Artillery Shells Near Border with South Korea; Leader’s Sister Mocks Seoul\nRerouting Of Vessels\nMajor shipping companies, such as Maersk, have been compelled to reroute vessels away from the Red Sea, opting for longer routes around Africa or temporarily suspending operations until the safety of their vessels can be guaranteed.\nInternational Response To Houthi Attacks\nOn January 11, the United States and the United Kingdom launched significant strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen as a response to the ongoing Houthi attacks on crucial shipping lanes.\nClear Message To Terrorists\nU.S. President Joe Biden stated that these strikes were a clear message that the U.S. would not tolerate attacks on its citizens or threats to navigation.\nAlso Read:\nFormer NRA Executive Pleads Guilty to Fraud; Agrees to Testify in New York AG Trial\nUk Prime Minister Chimes In\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak highlighted the considerable disruption caused to a vital trade route and the resulting increase in commodity prices.\nHouthi’s Continue To Strike Back\nDespite international actions, the Houthi group in Yemen has affirmed its intention to continue targeting ships bound for Israel.\nImpact On Oil Prices\nDue to the altered shipping routes in the region, the price of oil surged by 4%. Oil tankers chose to avoid the Red Sea, leading to significant shifts in trade routes and consequently affecting the global oil market.\nRead Next:\nHaley Campaign Urges Iowa Station to Halt Airings of Attack Ad\nMore from The Stock Dork – Trump Unveils Bold Policy Goals for Potential Second Term\nTrump Unveils Bold Policy Goals for Potential Second Term\nMore from The Stock Dork – New Pew Research Center Report Debunks GOP Immigration Myths\nNew Pew Research Center Report Debunks GOP Immigration Myths",
