  "text": "Jakarta –\nChairman of the Democratic Party Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono (\nME) talked about the success of the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) era defense program. He said that this success was continued by President Joko Widodo (Jokowi).\n“The commitment and what the Democratic Party wants to fight for is not just a promise, but we have provided evidence. Especially during the 10 year era of President SBY’s administration,” said AHY in his political speech in Yogyakarta, Friday (19/1/2024).\nAccording to AHY, the government in the Father’s era had sufficient fiscal space so that it could modernize the main weapons system (alutsista). SBY’s government is considered capable of diplomacy with other countries in order to sell modern defense systems.\n“With the diplomacy that we carry out, we can also convince a number of selling countries that\nIndonesia is capable and worthy of using this advanced weapon system. We are also able to gain trust that the modern defense equipment will not be misused,” said AHY.\n“Because, quite a few countries have money, but the producing countries don’t trust them to have high-tech defense equipment,” he said.\nAHY assessed that this success was continued by President Jokowi as president after SBY. Thus,\nIndonesia’s defense equipment continues to be modernized.\n“We are grateful that President Jokowi’s government is also continuing to procure defense equipment and modernize our defense forces. We believe that the government in the next five years will also continue to build our defense forces,” he said.\nNot only the Alutsista modernization program, SBY is also considered successful in contributing to maintaining\nworld peace. President Jokowi continued this success.\n“\nIndonesia has succeeded in becoming a major contributor to world peacekeeping forces. Thank God, this achievement has also been continued by President Jokowi’s government,” he said.\n“In a\nworld peace mission, in 2006, I also carried out state duties as part of the Garuda troops on the border of Lebanon and Israel,” he said.\n(aik/aud)\n2024-01-19 17:26:22\n#AHY #Values #Jokowi #Continuing #Success #SBYs #Defense #Policy",
