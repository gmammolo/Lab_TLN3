  "text": "In a dominant display of spin bowling mastery, Wanindu Hasaranga twirled his way to a stunning 4-15 performance, leading Sri Lanka to a convincing nine-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the final T20 international and securing a 2-1 series win for the hosts. Zimbabwe’s batsmen fell prey to mesmerizing leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga , limping to a record-low total of 82 all out, their innings collapsing with 35 balls still remaining. The tourists’ meager score stood as their lowest ever in T20 internationals, surpassing even their previous mark of 84 against New Zealand in 2010. With an impossibly low target to chase, Sri Lanka wasted no time. Opening batsman Pathum Nissanka blasted to an unbeaten 39 off just 23 deliveries, smashing five boundaries and a six to seal the win with a thunderous six off the 11th over. Kusal Mendis’ 33 was the only other significant contribution with the bat for Sri Lanka.

Axar Patel reveals his choice for India T20 captain Why picking Yashasvi Jaiswal over Gill was the right decision by Rohit & Dravid Hardik Pandya calls the shots: BCCI involves all-rounder in T20 World Cup planning Wanindu Hasaranga lead Sri Lanka to series win The victory capped off a dominant series performance for Sri Lanka, erasing the sting of their last-over thriller defeat in the second match. Angelo Mathews provided early support with the ball, grabbing two wickets, and Maheesh Theekshana also chipped in with one scalp. Zimbabwe’s only bright spot came in the opening overs, with Brian Bennett (29) and Tinashe Kamunhukamwe (12) briefly threatening to build a partnership. However, Wanindu Hasaranga masterful spell shut down any hopes of a fightback, showcasing his growing stature as a world-class spinner. Sri Lanka’s series win marks a welcome return to form after a turbulent period. Captain Wanindu Hasaranga, who led from the front both with bat and ball, will be delighted with the team’s response and the confidence boost this victory brings. For Zimbabwe, despite their late resurgence in the second match , the series serves as a reminder of the work required to consistently compete at the international level.",
