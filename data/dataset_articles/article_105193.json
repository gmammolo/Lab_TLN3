  "text": "The Prime Minister of Rwanda, Edouard Ngirente, highlighted the importance of peace and security during the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit. Representing President Paul Kagame at the summit that commenced on January 19 and will conclude on January 20, in Kampala, Uganda, Ngirente called on NAM member nations to actively maintain the momentum in promoting global peace. “In the spirit of promoting peace and stability, we, NAM partner nations, should continue to actively support and engage in peaceful resolution efforts, particularly those to address the root causes of conflicts. A stable world is essential for the overall prosperity of our people,” he emphasised.

He urged continuous representation of mutual respect, sovereignty, non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence among member nations. He noted that the summit coincides with Rwanda’s preparations to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. He explained that this anniversary invites Rwandans to reflect on the importance of peace and security. Expressing Rwanda’s commitment to preventing similar atrocities globally, Ngirente stated: “This commitment manifests in our engagements in peace support and peacekeeping operations.” In light of collaboration among NAM members, Ngirente invited them to join Rwandans in Kigali for the 3rd United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, scheduled for June 2024. He emphasised that the conference provides an opportunity to create a new path for enhanced cooperation and solidarity, which is crucial for resolving the unique challenges faced by nations. “As we navigate the complexities of our interconnected world, let us recommit ourselves to the principles of the NAM and work together to build a future of shared prosperity and peace for all,” he said. Uganda is currently chairing NAM until 2026 replacing Azerbaijan. Ngirente said that nation members trust that Uganda will guide the movement towards enhanced cooperation for global prosperity.",
