  "text": "[OSEN=이인환 기자] Shin Taeyong is magic Indonesia , led by coach Shin Tae-yong, won 1-0 with Asnawi’s penalty kick (PK) in the second match of Group D of the 2023 Qatar Asian Cup against Vietnam, which ended at Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha, Qatar on the 20th (Korean time). With this victory, Indonesia , which lost to Iraq in the first game, rose to third place in the group with 1 win and 1 loss. In the first game, the atmosphere of both teams was conflicting. Vietnam scored the first goal against strong Japan and went on to win 2-4. On the other hand, Indonesia lost by a large margin against Iraq and was evaluated as the weakest team in the group stage. But this game was different. Coach Shin Tae-yong thoroughly prepared a strategy tailored to Vietnam. After strong pressure, they took the lead early in the game through active attacks. Indonesia , which was fierce in the beginning, was unable to score a goal due to poor decision-making. Vietnam also began to gradually raise its line after the 20th minute of the first half. The momentum changed in the 22nd minute of the first half when Nguyen Tuan An fired a shot. Vietnam, which was shooting continuously, went on the offensive. In the 32nd minute of the first half, Vietnam aimed for the goal with a header after a cross, but was unsuccessful. The tight game was broken by PK. In the 39th minute of the first half, Indonesia received a PK when Struik induced a foul in front of the opponent’s goal. Asnawi, a former K-League player, took the kicker and finished the game, taking the lead to 1-0. The first half ended with the lead still being 1-0. At the beginning of the second half, Vietnam made a change to its offensive by eliminating Cuan Van Kang and Le Phan Tam Long. Indonesia , which was behind, replaced Asnawi with Sulaman in the 11th minute of the second half. In the 24 minutes of the second half, we focused on lowering the line with five backs and holding on. Vietnam could not overcome Indonesia ’s defense. Because it was a fierce battle for both teams, 10 minutes of extra time were given. Both teams struggled, but Indonesia held on until the end. In the end, Coach Shin Tae-yong’s Indonesia won 1-0, putting their fate at stake in the third game. Meanwhile, Japan lost 1-2 to Iraq in the previous game, so they will meet in the third game with 1 win and 1 loss. From coach Shin Tae-yong’s perspective, if the team achieves more than a draw against Japan, they can aim to advance to the round of 16 by finishing third in their group.
