  "text": "OIC Secretary-General commends King Mohammed VI, President of Al-Quds Committee, for his support to the Palestinian Cause Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Hussein Ibrahim Taha, expressed admiration for the substantial efforts made by King Mohammed VI, who serves as the President of the Al-Quds Committee, in support of the Palestinian cause. This came during a meeting at the OIC General Secretariat in Jeddah, Hussein Ibrahim Taha held with Mohamed Salem Cherkaoui, the Director overseeing the management of the Rabat-based Bayt Mal Al-Qods Acharif Agency. Talks highlighted the pivotal role played by the Agency as the financial arm of the Al-Quds Committee, operating under the umbrella of the OIC, and discussed strategies to bolster cooperation in a bid to back and strengthen the agency’s initiatives for Al-Quds and enhance the resilience of its population. Secretary-General Taha underscored the ongoing importance of implementing decisions urging member states to throw their weight behind the budget and programs of the Agency. He reiterated the General Secretariat’s unwavering commitment to intensifying collaboration with this crucial institution to help it streamline its tasks. During the meeting, Cherkaoui presented the annual report detailing the Agency’s activities throughout 2023. The report outlined various projects dedicated to supporting the people of Al-Quds in critical areas such as health, education, housing, women, youth, and childhood. Additionally, Cherkaoui shed light on specific programs tailored to address the needs of vulnerable groups within the population.
