  "text": "Great River Honor Flight marks 15 years of honoring veterans with 68 missions and counting QUINCY (WGEM) - In a remarkable milestone, the Great River Honor Flight is celebrating its 15th year of operation, having successfully completed 68 missions to date. Since Veterans Day in 2009, this local Honor Flight hub has been dedicated to providing free trips to Washington, D.C. for veterans from across Illinois, Missouri and Iowa. Carlos Fernandez, Chairman of the Great River Honor Flight Board, expressed gratitude for the continuous support from the public, emphasizing that the program’s longevity is a testament to the unwavering support it has received. “The reason it’s lasted 15 years is because the public has been very supportive of that,” Fernandez said. The program has made a significant impact by honoring nearly 2,200 veterans over the past 14 years. The breakdown includes 430 WWII veterans, 525 Korean War veterans, 1,098 Vietnam veterans, and 61 Armed Forces veterans. Veterans from 69 counties across Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa have been recognized, with some expressing that it’s the first genuine “thank you” they’ve received. Marine Vietnam Veteran Leslie Lair shared his perspective on the emotional experience. “When you go out as a veteran, it’s a whole new ballgame,” Lair said. “It’s something you don’t realize the emotions are there until you do it with other veterans.” The Great River Honor Flight has served as a unique opportunity for veterans to receive the appreciation they may not have felt upon returning home. “Many of them don’t think they deserve to go on an Honor Flight, which is foolish. They served their country, and that’s what we are here to honor,” Fernandez said. Looking ahead to 2024, the Great River Honor Flight is gearing up for six missions, continuing its tradition of honoring and celebrating the heroes who have served. The success of the program is not only measured in sentiment, but also in numbers. Over the past 14 years, the Great River Honor Flight has covered 120,904 air miles, visited 544 memorials, chartered 140 buses, served 11,694 meals, and distributed over 30,000 bottles of water. Additionally, more than 15,000 letters were handed out during mail calls. Vice-chair Sharon Lake emphasized that the mission is far from over. “Our number one goal is to ensure that all local veterans are aware of this opportunity and sign up for a future flight,” Lake said. Veterans who have served prior to July 1, 1985, are encouraged to visit the Great River Honor Flight [website](https://www.greatriverhonorflight.com/) and fill out an application to be added to the list for upcoming trips.
