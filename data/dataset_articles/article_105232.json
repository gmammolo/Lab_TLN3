On one side is a high-quality raw material production base, on the other side is mature technology and marketing experience. With the cooperation and assistance of Xihu District, Manshan Tea has become a gold-producing \"tea industry.\" Qin Xiuzhen introduced that in the past two years, an all-weather grid monitoring system and a comprehensive big data analysis platform have been built in the ancient tea garden to realize the full traceability of tea growth and refined management of the tea garden, turning traditional planting into a standardized and sustainable \"tea factory\" . Through in-depth surveys, protection and development of ancient tea trees, and the exploration of historical and cultural connotations such as the Ancient Tea Horse Road culture, tea villages and tea towns have also become popular tourist check-in destinations. In 2023, the comprehensive output value of Jiulong County Ecological Tea Modern Agricultural Industrial Park will be 70.83 million yuan, and tea sales revenue will be nearly 55 million yuan. Complementary advantages and resource aggregation will inject impetus into the industrial development of poverty-stricken areas.

The relevant person in charge of the Regional Cooperation Promotion Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that after years of assistance, poverty-stricken areas have made great progress, but the overall level still lags behind. In addition, some labor forces who have been lifted out of poverty have insufficient skills, and more assistance is needed. Li Qiusheng, director of the Shandong Provincial Counterpart Support Office, said that in the past three years, Lugan and Gansu provinces have focused on brand building and established the Lugan “Artisan Alliance” to target rural migrant laborers, rural “second-generation students”, unemployed college graduates, and returning farmers.
