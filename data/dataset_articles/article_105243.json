  "text": "Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel has conferred Friendship Medal Award to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to honour the organisation’s contributions to the advancement of social justice and global solidarity. The award was in appreciation of NLC’s unwavering support and commitment to fortifying the connections with Cuba, rooted in brotherhood, solidarity, and cooperation at labour levels. Cuban Ambassador to Nigeria, Miriam Morales, who presented the award to the NLC president, Comrade Joe Ajaero in Abuja, commended the recipient for the union’s contributions to the Cuban trade union movement and union’s efforts in denouncing aggressions against Cuba, with a special focus on condemning the economic blockade imposed by the United States. In response, Ajaero highlighted the need for the Nigerian government and international bodies to urge the West, particularly the United States, to lift the economic ban on Cuba as rooted in the pursuit of a new global economic order and the principles of democracy. He expressed gratitude for the award and conveyed goodwill messages to the Cuban government, while acknowledging the Cuban embassy‘s supportive role during challenges faced by NLC in especially in Imo State. He stressed the commitment to onward collaboration with the Cuban embassy and workers to eradicate social injustice and discrimination globally as he called for continued partnership in the interests of workers in both countries.",
