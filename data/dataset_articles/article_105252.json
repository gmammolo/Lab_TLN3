Ron DeSantis ordered the flag of the State of Florida to be flown at half-staff at the Lake County Courthouse in Tavares, Florida, and the City Hall of Leesburg, Florida, from sunrise to sunset on Sunday, January 21, 2024.\nSergeant Franklin P. Hall was a native Leesburg, Florida, resident who enlisted to fight in World War II. Hall was shot down while on a mission assigned to the 66th Bombardment Squadron.\nThe members of his crew were found by the Germans and his remains were interred in France. After the war, Hall’s remains were placed in Normandy, but still not identified and Sergeant Hall remained listed as MIA.\nUpon notification from the Department of Defense that Sergeant Hall’s remains were identified, he will finally be laid to rest in his hometown of Leesburg, Florida, on Sunday, January 21, 2024.\nAndroid Users, Click To\nDownload The Free Press App And Never Miss A Story.
