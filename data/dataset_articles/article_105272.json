  "text": "Berea native and former service member Jerad Knight has been nominated by peers for a special award. Knight has been nominated for the Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year. ”The Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year (AFI MSOY) award was founded in 2008 to honor military spouses from all branches of service,” the press release stated. “More than one million military spouses support and maintain the home front while our service members defend this great nation.” Knight served his country and towards the end of his service in Washington D.C., that’s where and when he met his now husband. ”We used to joke that he would convert me to ‘mil-spouse,’” he said to AFI in a more in-depth discussion on their website. “We have traveled the world and really made a great life. I have had the pleasure of meeting so many other spouses and really making strong bonds within our diverse and amazing community.” Knight, according to his LinkedIn, is an advocate for the male spouse community and LGBTQIA+ Service members and their families unique struggles in community building. Knight says he’s also a big advocate for mental and emotional health. ”The service and support you give to yourself is just as important as the care and service you give others,” he said. Several people nominated Jerad out the many mil-spouses at Buckley Space Force Base. ”I met Jerad last year at MSOY Week and immediately knew I had a friend for life. Jerad’s love for Ohana Homefront Foundation is amazing. The way he advocates for OHF warms my heart. Jerad is an amazing man. He loves his awesome husband, foundation, (the award), and country. He definitely deserves this nomination,” one nomination said. To check out more on this competition, visit [https://msoy.afi.org/](https://msoy.afi.org/). First round voting begins on Feb. 4.",
