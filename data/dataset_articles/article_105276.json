  "text": "[House](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) Rep. Turner says it was ‘very important’ Biden took action against Houthis ‘to diminish their overall capability’ Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said it was “very important” that President Biden took action against the Houthis in the wake of recent strikes conducted against the Yemeni militant group. “You can’t play defense continuously, and you have to let them know that they’re not going to be able to continue this,” Turner said Thursday on CNN. “So, it’s very important that the president took the step in Yemen to hit the Houthis, to begin to diminish their overall capabilities, but they need to know they’re gonna be paying a price for trying to diminish the ability to have commercial shipping.” The Houthis have [faced strikes](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4416914-us-battle-houthis-no-signs-stopping/) from the U.S. recently, beginning last week in [retaliation to](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4404218-us-uk-retaliatory-strike-houthis-yemen/) Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. They have [attacked](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4414834-us-fourth-strike-on-houthis/) cargo ships including U.S.-owned ships and U.S. Navy vessels in recent weeks. “Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels,” Biden said last Thursday. “These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes.” “I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary,” Biden said. The Houthis have said that they will keep fighting as long as Israeli soldiers are fighting in Gaza in their war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. “Americans want the seas to be safe for the support and resources provided to the Israeli enemy while starving the Palestinian people,” Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Thursday. “We warn against weariness towards the oppression of the Palestinian people. The longer the siege and starvation continue, the greater the responsibility on our nation.” [Houthi attacks]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthi-attacks/ ) [houthi strikes]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthi-strikes/ ) [Houthis]( https://thehill.com/tag/houthis/ ) [Houthis]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/houthis/ ) [Joe ) [Mike Turner]( https://thehill.com/people/mike-turner/ ) [Mike Turner]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/mike-turner/ ) [Red Sea]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/red-sea/ ) [Yemen]( https://thehill.com/social-tags/yemen/ House News [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [ House ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) [See All](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/) ",
