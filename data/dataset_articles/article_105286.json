In the Veterans Gallery on the second floor, a photography exhibit is on display, called \"Veterans in Focus.\" It features photos taken by 12 veterans throughout southeastern Wisconsin. The photography was part of their recreation therapy through the Milwaukee VA Center. \"Getting out with the camera just kind of takes their mind off daily stressors. It really helps focus what the subject is,\" said Courtney Zeller, recreation therapist at the Va Medical Center. \"Being with groups of veterans, it gives you that secure, camaraderie feeling,\" said Jeffry Peterson, US Navy Veteran. s",
