Short on cash, Ukraine is defending against new Russian attacks after its own counteroffensive failed to yield significant gains. Moscow has also resumed a campaign of mass air strikes on population centres far beyond the front line.\n‘Unaffordable luxury’ For Pavlo Kuzmenko, the Mayor of Okhtyrka, a town only 20 km down the road from Trostianets that also bears the scars of heavy Russian bombing at the start of the war, resurrecting town squares is a luxury Ukraine cannot afford right now.\nOfficials in Okhtyrka were slow to finish clearing away the rubble on the main boulevard that was once the city hall and have not yet fixed the gutted department store across the street. Most schools, however, have been repaired with new windows, roofing or bomb shelters, thanks in large part to international donors.\nMr. Kuzmenko, who publicly criticised the plans for Trostianets last year and bemoaned a lack of resources, said the focus should be on patching up homes and critical infrastructure only. Any other available funds should go to the military.\n“There is plenty to rebuild,” Kuzmenko said. “Squares, and all their decorations, can be done after the war.”\nStanding near the remains of the city hall, Okhtyrka resident Antonina Dmytrychenko said she agreed with her mayor: “First we need victory, then reconstruction.”\nThe different views in the neighbouring towns reflect a broader debate about wartime spending playing out across Ukraine. Most visibly, a growing grassroots protest movement is demanding that discretionary projects, such as sprucing up streets and public spaces, be shelved in favour of the military.\nIn a sign of the tension, officials in the Odesa region cancelled more than $9 million of tenders during the last three months of 2023, saying spending on things such as road repairs, the renovation of a stadium and software was “unacceptable” during wartime.\nThe disputes highlight the need for a clearly communicated government strategy for what recovery and, more broadly, a war-adapted economy should look like, said Orysia Lutsevych at the Chatham House think-tank in London.\nShe said officials must urgently unlock Ukraine’s economic potential by restoring income-generating growth opportunities that can help defeat Russia — and that meant luring people back as well as stopping more leaving the country for good.\n‘Same equation’ “Militaries win battles, but economies win wars. It’s part of the same equation,” she said.\nIt might make sense, for example, to build more schools in the comparably safer western city of Lviv for the many Ukrainians displaced there by fighting elsewhere, so they will stay and contribute to the wartime economy, Ms. Lutsevych said.\n“This is what rebuilding is: maybe it’s not fancy playgrounds, maybe it’s not new zoos,” she said. “But it must be a category of projects that fits within the wider strategy of how Ukraine will sustain this war.”\nSo far, more than $1.6 billion has been earmarked from the fund for reconstruction, Prime Minister Shmyhal said in October.\nThe pilot projects received about $86 million last year, though the 2024 budget has not yet been set, a spokesperson for the reconstruction agency said.\nOverall, the World Bank has estimated that rebuilding Ukraine will cost more than $400 billion over the next decade, and Western lenders have signalled they are prepared to provide the bulk of the financing.\nCOMMents\nSHARE\nCopy link Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit",
