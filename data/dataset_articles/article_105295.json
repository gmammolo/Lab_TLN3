  "text": "Watch: Rudra Chopper, Army's 'Dark Knight', Hit Targets At Night According to HAL, the chopper is designed for a high rate of climb in case of a single engine failure. It is ideal for operations from unprepared surfaces and slopes. The main roles of the Rudra include to destroy tanks, give fire support to ground troops, and conduct armed reconnaissance and surveillance. Designed and developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), the Rudra is a multirole chopper weighing 5.8 tonnes. The Indian Army's Spear Corps on Friday introduced the Rudra - the combat version of the Dhruv helicopter and the first home-grown attack chopper - in a new video on X. The video gives a glimpse into the preparations involved in setting the Rudra for a night combat mission. In the post, the Spear Corps termed Rudra the 'Piercing Eye in the Sky - Swift, Precise & Lethal'. A section of the video titled \"Arming The Beast\" shows Aviation Corps personnel loading large-calibre rounds for the attack helicopter's nose-mounted 20-mm cannon. The Rudra is then seen in a circular and green night vision scope taking off in the dark. After a brief low-height flying, Rudra fires some rockets at a group of targets in the dark, which are visible in the green glow of the night vision. \"Any mission, any time, any place,\" the Spear Corps said in the post on X. After the successful 'mission', the Rudra returns to base and lands gently towards the end of the video. Designed and developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), the Rudra is a multirole chopper weighing 5.8 tonnes. According to HAL, the chopper is designed for a high rate of climb in case of a single engine failure. It is ideal for operations from unprepared surfaces and slopes. The main roles of the Rudra include to destroy tanks, give fire support to ground troops, and conduct armed reconnaissance and surveillance. Apart from the 20 mm turret gun, the Rudra can also carry 70 mm rockets and short-range air-to-air missiles.
