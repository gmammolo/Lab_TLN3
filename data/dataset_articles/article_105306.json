  "text": "Ismaila Sarr scored one goal and laid on another as defending champions Senegal beat Cameroon 3-1 on Friday and booked their place in the round of 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations, leaving their opponents in some peril.\nSarr opened the scoring in the first half of the Group C clash in Yamoussoukro after a mistake by Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana, who was playing his first game of the tournament after a late arrival in the Ivory Coast.\nHabib Diallo added the second goal from Sarr’s cross before Jean-Charles Castelletto scored a late consolation for Cameroon. Sadio Mane completed the scoring for Senegal in injury time.\nThe Lions of Teranga advance to the knockout rounds with a final group game against Guinea to spare. Cameroon must play Gambia in their last match. Both of those are on Tuesday.\nVoting lines now open for Sportstar ACES Awards 2024\nSenegal head the pool with six points from their two games, while Cameroon and Guinea have a point each and Gambia are yet to break their duck. The latter two sides meet at the same venue later on Friday.\nCameroon barely tested Senegal keeper Edouard Mendy until the final 10 minutes when they could have earned a point after a limp performance that followed a 1-1 draw with Guinea in their opener -- alarming form for coach Rigobert Song.\nHe selected Onana after the keeper missed the Guinea game in order to play for Manchester United against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, and will be frustrated by the manner of the first goal conceded.\nSarr netted on 16 minutes after Onana attempted to punch clear a cross but did not get the height or distance he needed and the ball fell to the winger, whose deflected shot went into the bottom corner.\nSarr then turned provider when he was left in acres of space on the right-hand side of the box and his low cross was turned home from four yards by Diallo.\nThat goal seemed to spark Cameroon into life and they found a way back into the contest with a goal from a corner as Castelletto headed in Olivier Ntcham’s cross.\nIt should have been 2-2 following a horrific miss at the back post from Georges-Kevin Nkoudou, who headed wide with the goalmouth gaping.\nSenegal went up the other end and sealed the three points when Mane netted their third goal.\nComments\nRelated Topics Ismaila Sarr /\nSenegal /\nCameroon /\nAFCON 2024 /\nAfrican Cup of Nations /\nManchester United /\nAndre Onana /\nHabib Diallo /\nSadio Mane /\nGambia /\nGuinea /\nTottenham Hotspur /\nPremier League /\nPremier League 2023-24\nLatest on Sportstar AFCON 2024: Defending champions Senegal steam into last 16 with 3-1 win over Cameroon Reuters Ranji Trophy LIVE Score, Round 3 Day 2: Jagadeesan 150 helps TN dominate Railways; Mumbai 251 all out vs Kerala, Goa 228/8 vs Karnataka Team Sportstar Former Juventus chairman Agnelli loses bid to overturn ban Reuters Saudi Pro League: Benzema returns to ‘furious’ Saudi club 17 days late AFP AFCON 2023: Tanzania coach Adel Amrouche suspended for insulting opponents Reuters READ MORE STORIES READ THE LATEST ISSUE Leander Paes on Hall of Fame induction — ‘My parents’ encouragement and constant love are the reasons I could achieve it all’ Shayan Acharya, Amitabha Das Sharma Paris Olympics 2024: Who will join Neeraj Chopra and Kishore Jena in javelin throw event Jonathan Selvaraj + SEE all Stories",
