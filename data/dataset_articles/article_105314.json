  "text": "Guinea beat Gambia to close on AFCON last 16 Sports Aguibou Camara's second-half goal gave Guinea a 1-0 win over Gambia. YAMOUSSOUKRO (Ivory Coast) (AFP) – Aguibou Camara's second-half goal gave Guinea a 1-0 win over Gambia at the Africa Cup of Nations on Friday, a result that left them on the brink of securing a place in the last 16. Midfielder Camara, who plays his club football in Greece, swept home an assist from Morgan Guilavogui midway through the second half to decide the Group C contest in Ivorian capital Yamoussoukro. Guinea had been the more dangerous side despite again being without star striker Serhou Guirassy, just as they were for their opening 1-1 draw with Cameroon. Mohamed Bayo, leading Guinea's attack in Guirassy's absence, hit the post in the first half for a side who are aiming to reach the knockout phase at a third consecutive Cup of Nations. The result leaves them second in the group on four points, two points behind reigning champions Senegal who defeated Cameroon 3-1 earlier to clinch their place in the knockout phase. Guinea need just a draw against Senegal in their next match on Tuesday to guarantee qualification for the last 16, but a victory will see them progress as group winners. Gambia, surprise quarter-finalists two years ago, have no points but a win in their last group match against Cameroon could yet see them advance as one of the best third-placed teams.",
