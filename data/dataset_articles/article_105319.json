  "text": "Japan landed its first-ever probe on the moon after a spate of setbacks to the nation’s space program, but a power problem might cut the mission short.\nThe SLIM lander, nicknamed “moon sniper,” touched down about 20 minutes past midnight Japan time on Saturday morning. The lightweight lander was launched in September by the H2-A heavy payload rocket co-developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.\nThe lander reached the surface and sent out a rover to collect data, JAXA said. While the rover is sending a signal, the agency said the lander’s solar cells aren’t generating energy, meaning it may run out of power within the next several hours. A heater has been turned off to preserve the battery’s power, and it’s possible the lander could recharge as the sun moves.\n“We believe we’ve achieved the minimum criteria for success,” a JAXA official told reporters.\nA soft landing — in which a spacecraft is brought to a controlled stop — of the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon puts Japan in exclusive company, with just the United States, U.S.S.R., China and India managing the feat already.\nExclusion from the elite club has been a sore point for Japan, which beat archrival China in launching its first satellite in 1970 but has since taken a back seat to a series of high-profile Chinese space successes. That includes the world’s first ever soft landing on the far side of the moon in 2019, and landing on Mars in 2021.\n India has eclipsed Japan, too, succeeding in a second attempt last August by landing near the lunar south pole. While the Americans and Soviets sent spacecraft to the moon during the Cold War, the U.S. and Russia have struggled trying to return: Russia’s Luna-25 crashed last August, and a NASA-backed mission from Pittsburgh startup Astrobotic Technology Inc. failed this month.\nFor Japan, landing on the moon has been even tougher to crack. JAXA lost contact with a lunar lander in late 2022, and Tokyo-based Ispace Inc. also suffered a communication failure with a craft bound for the moon last April.\nOther setbacks include the botched debut of JAXA’s H3 heavy-lift rocket, which failed after takeoff last March and hasn’t flown since. Meanwhile, JAXA’s smaller Epsilon rocket is grounded, too, following an explosion in October 2022.\nLunar Lander\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.
