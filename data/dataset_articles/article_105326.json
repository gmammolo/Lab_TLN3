  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Udupi (MS) Udupi, Jan 20: Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually laid the foundation stone from Chennai on Friday for the Akashvani FM Radio broadcast centre (transmitter) that is intended to be constructed in the city. Chandrashekhar Shetty, national spokesperson of technical employees’ association of Akashvani and Doordarshan, said, “Earlier, this centre that is situated near Ajjarkadu Nayarkere, used to function as Doordarshan relay centre. The Akashvani FM Radio broadcast centre, the virtual foundation of which is laid by PM Modi, will function in the same building where there is no activity at present. “The extension of radio centres is taken up under the BIND project of union government in order to make the pro-people schemes and information of the central government reach every household in addition to education, information and entertainment. More than 600 FM transmitters will be established in various phases throughout the country. Every citizen will get the information on the benefits of schemes of government,” he said. Unnikrishna, chief of Mangaluru Akashavani, Mohini Bailoor, chief of technical department, Ajit Kumar Baikadi, chief of Brahmavar Akashvani, Baikadi Suprasad Shetty and senior personnel were present.
