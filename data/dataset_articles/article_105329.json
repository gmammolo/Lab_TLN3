selection narrowly beats Iceland.\nThe game in the ticker for reading.\nHandball European Championship: Germany against Iceland |\n26:24 (11:10)\nDramatic final phase: Germany defeats Iceland\nThe live ticker of the game can be read\nConclusion: Germany celebrates a successful start to the main round in Cologne in front of almost 20,000 enthusiastic spectators.\nFor the entire 60 minutes, the DHB team fought a big battle with Iceland, which was only decided in the last seconds.\nIt went back and forth again and again, no team was able to break away decisively.\nThe outstanding man on the German side is once again goalkeeper Andreas Wolff, who parries two seven-meter penalties in quick succession in the final phase and thus maintains the German lead.\nWolff was then rightly voted player of the game by the fans.\nThanks to this success, the national team's semi-final dream lives on.\nWe continue with the game against Austria on Saturday.\nGermany – Iceland 26:24 (11:10)\nGermany:\nSpäth, Wolff - Dahmke, Mertens - Hanne, Heymann, Köster - Weber, Knorr, Häfner, Uscins - Steinert, Kastening - Fischer, Golla, Kohlbacher\nIceland:\nGústavsson, Hallgrímsson -

foul.\nThe DHB team was outnumbered in these final moments.\nNow it's getting very tight.\nGermany led by Juri Knorr defeated Iceland 26:24 in a hard-fought game.\n© IMAGO/kolbert-press/Marc Niemeyer\n59th minute:\nAndreas Wolff, you devilish guy!\nIncomprehensible.\nThe DHB keeper saves two seven meters within a few seconds and maintains the German lead.\nJust over a minute left to play.\nGislason takes another break.\nMy news\nGreat fight is not rewarded: DHB team loses to France\nEngaged handballer dream couple: German national player asked world handballer to pick her hand\n“What a megastar”: Handball fans celebrate their Germany hero reading\nMission to defend the title: German “Bad Boys” start reading in Croatia\n59th minute:\nIt couldn't be more exciting.\nIceland comes within one goal again and Knorr is whistled for a striker's foul.\nThen the next seven meter for Iceland.\n57th minute\n: Knorr hits powerfully from distance!\nGermany is two goals ahead again.\nOn the other side, after a foul on the circle, Iceland gets the next seven meter penalty.\nBut Wolff holds!\nVery strong parade.\nThat could be the decision.\n56th minute:\nNext seven meter, which Knorr takes himself this time because he is fouled while throwing.\nAfter two missed throws from Knorr, Kastening now takes over and scores.\nImportant hit.\n55th minute\n: Next time out!\nNational coach Gislason pushes his team forward again.\n54th minute:\nMertens puts Germany back in front.\nEvery hit can now be a decisive one.\nAfter that, the German defense is strong and forces the missed throw.\nKöster fights for the next seven-meter penalty, but Knorr is again denied by substitute keeper Gustavsson.\n52nd minute:\nKnorr serves Häfner with a strong pass and is fouled hard.\nThe next time penalty for Iceland.\nShortly afterwards there was a highlight: Kastening found Köster, who stepped in.\nUsing a Kempa trick to equalize.\nThat should wake up the hall again.\n50th minute\n: Outnumbered, Germany concedes the deficit through Palmarsson, but Knorr scores well with a spin.\nIt remains incredibly exciting\n49th minute:\nKohlbacher asserts himself strongly in the circle and takes the lead for Germany.\nBut again Iceland is doing it quickly.\nHeymann defends in the circle and pulls his opponent down.\nSeven meters and a time penalty are the result.\nGermany against Iceland: tension until the final phase\n47th minute:\nIt remains incredibly exciting.\nBoth teams miss a few chances.\n44th minute:\nKohlbacher takes the next seven meter, but Knorr fails for the first time.\nIn the counterattack, Palmarsson equalized for Iceland.\n43rd minute:\nNo team can really pull away here.\nKastening hits again strongly with a spin, but Kristjansson can immediately shorten the score again.\nIt remains a tough fight.\n40th minute:\nKastening is hardly in the game yet, but now he comes through on the right wing and scores with a nice spin.\nBut Germany keeps failing to pull within three goals.\nSo Iceland can catch up again.\n37th minute:\nIceland here with some offensive lapses in concentration at the start of the second half.\nThe guests keep missing out on great opportunities, especially from outside, also because Wolff is once again holding strong.\nBut Germany can't really capitalize on it on the other side.\nThere is a lack of flow on both sides.\n35th minute:\nKöster takes the next seven meter, which Knorr can safely convert.\nIn return, Palmarsson only hits the post.\n33rd minute:\nAfter the Icelanders equalize, Knorr makes a very long run-up to throw and puts Germany back in front.\nThe teams are back, things continue!\nGermany goes into the second half with a narrow lead.\nGermany against Iceland in the live ticker: Tight break lead for the DHB team\nHalf time!\nIn an extremely combative game, Germany narrowly led 11:10 at the break.\n30th minute:\nGolla becomes increasingly better integrated in the circle and can take the lead after a nice pass from Knorr.\nBoth teams then missed chances before halftime\n28th minute:\nHeymann is fouled while moving towards the goal and gets the first seven-meter penalty for Germany.\nKnorr can convert on the right and puts Germany back in the lead.\nBut the Icelanders are also increasingly dangerous offensively and can equalize in no time.\n27th minute\n: Kristjansson from Magdeburg gives Wolff no chance with a hard throw from the second row and ensures the equalizer.\nReason enough for national coach Gislason to take the first time out.\n25th minute:\nHeymann comes into the game and joins in with a strong hit from the half-right side and then draws the Icelandic striker's foul.\nThe next attack also runs through him.\nHallgrimsson cannot fend off his strong throw this time from half left.\nGermany again ahead by 2 goals!\n22nd minute:\nAgain and again Andeas Wolff.\nThe DHB goalkeeper drives the Icelanders to despair.\nBut offensively, Germany can hardly benefit from the many parades.\nThus the balance follows.\n20th minute\n: Iceland takes the first time out.\n20th minute:\nWolff prevents the equalizer again.\nThe goalkeeper is again at an outstanding rate of 50 percent.\nBut Hanne fails repeatedly because of the strong goalkeeper Hallgrimsson.\n18th minute:\nAndreas Wolff again!\nThe goalkeeper is great in the game and can parry the next ball.\nIn return, Germany cannot go within three goals because the Icelandic goalkeeper Hallgrimsson first parries against Hanne and then strongly against Knorr.\nGermany against Iceland in the live ticker: DHB team takes the lead for the first time after a weak start\n15th minute:\nGermany takes the lead for the first time!\nHanne with a powerful throw from the second row.\nThe goalscorer then defends in the circle, the next penalty is given, but it only hits the crossbar.\nThe momentum is clearly with Germany.\nGermany (in white Julian Köster) meets Iceland in the first game of the main round.\n© IMAGO / Eibner\n13th minute:\nKöster finally finds Golla with a nice pass in the middle of the circle, who finishes powerfully and reduces the deficit to one goal again.\nWolff then made his third save after a throw from the backcourt.\nKöster again equalized shortly afterwards.\n11th minute\n: With the majority, Köster finds a big gap in the Icelanders' defense and reduces the score to 3:4.\nThen the next seven meter for Iceland for supposedly defending in the circle.\nThis time Wolff can't parry.\n9th minute:\nAfter a foul on Golla, Gislason receives his first time penalty.\nGermany then combines well and finds Kastening on the outside, but her throw goes over.\n7th minute:\nKnorr reduces Germany's lead to 2:3 after a quick breakthrough through the middle.\nThen there is the first seven meter for Iceland.\nBut Wolff parries world-class.\n5th minute:\nWolff with the first strong save!\nBut Germany hasn't really found its offensive yet.\nKöster with a bad pass.\nOn the counterattack, Knorr draws the foul and sees the yellow card.\n3rd minute\n: Köster fails after a breakthrough in the circle to Hallgrímsson, Iceland counters and scores to make it 0-2.\nThen the first German goal.\n2nd minute:\nThe first German attack is whistled back after time has expired.\nIceland takes the lead.\nThrow: It's starting!\nGermany has the ball first.\nUpdate, 8:29 p.m\n.: Curious faux pas shortly before the start of the game.\nInstead of the Icelandic anthem, a fake anthem is played first.\nThe hall announcer apologizes for the mistake.\nAfter a few moments, the real anthem is finally played.\nUpdate, 8:27 p.m.:\nGoosebumps atmosphere in Cologne!\nThe fans sing the German national anthem together with the team, followed by loud applause.\nIt's about to start!\nUpdate, 8:24 p.m\n.: The German team comes onto the scene and is greeted with chants and huge applause by the almost 20,000 fans.\nGermany has never lost a European Championship game in Cologne.\nUpdate, 8:22 p.m.:\nNational coach Alfred Gislason invokes the team spirit of the German team on ZDF.\n“We have to reflect on our own strengths,” he demands.\nThe defense in particular must be “tight” and not allow easy goals to be conceded.\nUpdate, 8:20 p.m.:\nOn the offensive, Iceland will probably rely on the Magdeburg axis around Omar Ingi Magnusson and Gisli Kristjansson.\nHowever, the offense repeatedly loses the ball, the second most among the last twelve teams.\nGermany wants to punish this weakness with goals from quick counterattacks.\nUpdate, 8:10 p.m.:\nThe Icelanders have been particularly vulnerable on defense so far in the tournament.\nIceland conceded the most goals among the twelve main round teams.\nThe defense has repeatedly revealed weaknesses, especially when it comes to physicality in the circle.\nThis could be a great chance for many hits, especially for DHB captain Johannes Golla.\nUpdate, 8 p.m.:\nThe tension is rising, another half hour and then it starts.\nThe seats in the Lanxess Arena are already well filled.\nMany of the handball fans have already watched the game between France and Croatia, which ended a few minutes ago.\nUpdate, 7:40 p.m\n.: Two games have already taken place in the German main round group today.\nAustria celebrated its next surprise win with a 30:29 win against Hungary and has three points.\nFrance won the top game against Croatia 34:32 and is now the leader with four points.\nThis also means: Germany could overtake the Croatians with a win and would then be level on points with Hungary.\nUpdate, 7.20 p.m\n.: A victory is almost mandatory for the DHB selection today if the dream of reaching the semi-finals is to continue to live.\nJust like Germany, Iceland moved into the main round with zero points from the preliminary round.\nUpdate from January 18th, 7 p.m\n.:\nHello and welcome to the live ticker for today's game.\nIn 90 minutes, Germany will face Iceland in the Lanxess Arena in Cologne to kick off the main round.\nFirst report from January 18th:\nCologne – main round opener for Germany at the home European Championships!\nIn the Lanxess Arena in Cologne, the DHB team wants to take the first step towards the semi-finals against Iceland.\nAfter the narrow defeat against France at the end of the preliminary round, Germany goes into the main round without any points - the defeat against Iceland should be forgotten.\nThe mood in Cologne should give a boost.\nHandball national coach Alfred Gislason meets with the DHB team in Iceland.\n© Sören Stache/dpa\nHandball European Championship: Germany against Iceland today in the live ticker\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the team was ceremoniously welcomed by a carnival troupe in front of Cologne Central Station and musically prepared for the upcoming European Championship festivities.\n“This is crazy, this is Cologne.\nWe are super happy to be here now,” said right winger Timo Kastening to the SID with shining eyes.\nAround 20,000 spectators are expected in the arena in the evening.\nAccording to Kastening, Cologne is “the Mecca of handball”.\nDHB board member Axel Kromer added in the morning before leaving Berlin: “It’s a bit like coming home.”\nCoach Alfred Gislason, who faces his home country, will probably think the same.\nSpecial duel for national coach Gislason\nEven before the throw-off there will be a strange situation because the DHB coach announced that he would sing both national anthems.\n“I will do everything to win this game.\nI'm Icelandic, but I work with the German team and love this team,\" assured the coach and confirmed: \"Maybe I'm selfish, but I always want to win, even among friends or family.\"\nGislason is also expecting some family members in the hall - the 64-year-old hopes that they will support his team.\n“My dad, my brothers and my uncles will all be in the stands.\nI'm very excited whether in the German jersey or the Icelandic one.\n“I would take it very personally this time,” said the coach with a wink.",
