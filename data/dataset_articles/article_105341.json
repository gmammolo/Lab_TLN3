  "text": "MEERUT: Nine months after being featured in TOI and two months post his mention in Prime Minister Modi's 'Mann ki Baat', 67-year-old Ram Singh Baudh, owner of 1,100 radios, has received a special invite for the Republic Day parade, including a five-day stay at Delhi's Ashoka Hotel and visits to important sites.\\\"It's beyond my comprehension. Since PM broadcasts his messages on the radio, getting a mention from him in Mann ki Baat was certainly a dream come true. Still, this invite is a next-level acknowledgement,\\\" said Baudh, holding a letter of invitation from the Ministry of Defence and a letter from Prasar Bharti.Notably, all those mentioned in the PM's monthly radio address have been invited. The letter signed by deputy director Prasar Bharti, Mukesh Kumar stated, \\\"You are among the honoured guests who found mention in the PM's Mann ki Baat. We invite you to witness the 75th Republic Day parade.\\\" Retired from the Warehouse Corporation of India, Baudh spends most of his time with his collection of 1,100 radios, gathered over the years spending lakhs of rupees from different junk markets of Delhi, Meerut and several other towns. \\\"The future generation will never get to know of the significance of the radio evolution that's still impacting our lives in the modern form and hence decided to begin the collection\\\", says Baudh who remembers spending his entire monthly salary to purchase his first radio in 1977 for Rs 350. Today, his oldest radio, made in 1900 with 'Made in England' engraved on it, represents the evolution of radio technology in India. In the 107th edition of 'Mann Ki Baat' on November 26, PM Modi highlighted the impact of the programme on making radio more popular in households. Baudh, from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, was acknowledged for his decades-long radio collection. His museum gained increased curiosity after the Mann Ki Baat mention, as mentioned in a letter received by the PM on 'MYGOV'.",
