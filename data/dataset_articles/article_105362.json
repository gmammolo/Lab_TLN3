An elite force that operates in the shadows. The operations that its fighters will rarely carry out are within the borders of the country and usually very far from home and in a way that exceeds all imagination. On October 7, The phones of the commanders of the operational area rang and the report passed from one to the other: one of the unit's fighters was wounded by gunfire from Hamas terrorists in the area of ​​the \"Nova\" festival in Ra'im. Commanders and fighters hurried to reach the unit's home base, organized themselves with combat equipment and drove south. On the way they received information that the unit's fighter was headed for by the Sheldag unit and evacuated by helicopter to the hospital. At a later stage in the war, the unit's members found and rescued the bodies of Ron Sherman, Nick Beiser, Elia Toledano, Ziv Dado and Eden Zakaria, who were kidnapped by Hamas and are now talking to Walla!.\nBringing the bodies back to Israel/IDF spokesman\n\"I make a decision that we don't stop and prepare for what's coming, but simply continue driving south. It has to be said that there wasn't a clear picture at the beginning. Me and 12 fighters are going to Kibbutz Bari,\" explained G (38), commander of a platoon of fighters in the operational area.\n\"We fought there from the morning until the night of Sunday. We moved from house to house and assisted in the rescue of about a hundred civilians. This is not a routine event at all for us. Until then, we are doing operations in other places. Our formations turned on us and we became a unit that responds to a terrorist incident.\"\nWith the sunset on October 8 and the realization that this is a very intense war that will unfold in several different arenas, the 504 fighters return to the unit's base and prepare for the command.\n\"We didn't work with Gaza until October 7. We worked in other sectors further away. I personally have never worked in Gaza. Take it wherever your head sails for what we are responsible for on a routine basis. I can't talk about it,\" explained the commander of the fighting division.\nThe commander of Unit 504 conducted a situation assessment and ultimately decided that the unit's operational space would throw and exhaust all of its combat power, intelligence resources and technological capabilities into the war.\nThe mission assigned to the operational space was to scan and locate selected Hamas sites at the head of the maneuvering forces that are a top priority for the intelligence community with an emphasis on the issue of prisoners and missing persons.\nMore in Walla!\nIt's so delicious and simple: a recipe for caramelized bananas\nIn collaboration with the Galil company\nMembers of Unit 504 in action/IDF spokesperson\nThe command passed down.\nThe commander of the 3rd fleet gathered his warriors and terrified them.\n\"We understand that Gaza knocked hard on our door. We received special missions to locate, scan, and bring civilians and soldiers home,\" he said.\nRoutine secret missions were halted, and the fighters of the combat cruises were prepared \"for the next big thing in areas never before operated\".\nAt record speed, they accumulated intelligence files, deepened the field cells and operational areas, created tools to shorten the process of gathering intelligence information in real time with the help of the unit's existing capabilities.\nThe first to maneuver deep into the Palestinian territory was Division 162, which was joined from the first moment by the fighters of the operational area.\n\"I can't expand, but our contribution is crucial. The capabilities that our unit is developing make a lot possible. Therefore, we will be part of this effort as long as there is a maneuver and it is in-depth,\" described G.\nOne of the turning points came during the fifth candle of Hanukkah on December 14.\nThe intelligence pointed to an area with an underground system where there is apparently a possibility that Hamas holds the bodies of prisoners.\nTotal darkness.\nEvery minute exchanges of fire in the area.\nAir force bombs and tanks firing at anti-tank squads. The activity is carried out in a neighborhood in the heart of enemy territory, where at any moment a terrorist can emerge from a shaft in the area and attack the troops.\nEden Zakaria and Ziv Dado/IDF spokesman\nThere is someone at home who loves and waits\nA series of operations carried out by two squadrons of fighters from 504, reduced the space where underground infrastructure could be found and deepened the understanding of the presence of an infiltration route to the infrastructure.\n\"This is a very complex operation. Nothing is clear about it. A very complex operation and we are supposed to reach the underground medium to extract bodies for identification purposes. We do not know what it is exactly and what to expect. We only know based on intelligence and logic. One thing is clear to us. In order to get the Our people out, we used all the capabilities at our disposal and the one who is leading this effort is the commander of the area, Col.\nEveryone mobilized for this mission.\"\nC describes the operations in an interview with Walla!. \"We had two targeted operations to retrieve bodies.\nThe first on a Thursday candle and the second three days later.\nOur unit is busy attacking the enemy and this is the first time that the unit is required for this type of activity.\nThere is no task more valuable than this task.\nRescuing the bodies of our people.\"\nOne of the fighters described the feeling on a personal level. \"'Remember there is someone at home who loves him and is waiting for him and we are doing everything we can to get him out without knowing who it is,'\" he described. \"It was clear to us from the beginning To take a great risk also to bring civilians and soldiers to the grave of Israel.\nThis is the small point of light in all the darkness that started on October 7th.\nIn the end what is standing before your eyes is our brothers and sisters who deserve to be buried in the tomb of Israel.\nWe will do everything to bring others to burial so that the mother and wife and children will have a grave where they can cry and mourn.\"\nFrom right to left: Ron Sherman, Elia Toledano and Nick Beiser/Official website, no\nS. (28), the field officer who led the operation in the underground space to locate and physically extract the bodies of the soldiers, told Walla!: \"We are busy every day solving complex operational problems. We are not brought to an activity that everyone knows how to do. Is there an operational challenge? We come and in the worlds Secrets are challenging. We have amazing capabilities and they surprise us every time. This time we were brought together with a very complex problem. I am proud of the solution we were able to bring to the IDF's toolbox and to success at the end.\n\" The state, starting with the first phone call about the injury of the unit member and then the realization that there are families who need help in the settlements in the Western Negev and ending with the rescue of the kidnapped bodies. \"It was not a question at all.\nWe moved south quickly.\nThen we talked about how to solve the problem.\nIn the first rescue?\nI did not believe that we would be able to solve the problem.\nThe neighborhood where we operated was very complex and very dangerous.\nThere were forces all around and massive shooting.\nEvery minute that passes everyone is in awe until finally you realize that it is our people.\nFor me personally?\nIt was the Holy of Holies.\nThere is nothing more important than that.\nWe put the bodies on the stretchers, and covered them with the Israeli flag.\nAll the power went silent.\nI won't say where it was.\nWe were very excited.\nThere were warriors with tears in their eyes.\nWe entered the area with our brothers and left with another of our brothers.\nIn my eyes, this is a tipping point.\nI have done many operations over the years and in my eyes this was the most significant operation in my service.\nTo bring a brother and a sister and several more brothers after that from this lowest and darkest place literally.\nThere were very difficult moments there.\nI will spare the plastic descriptions, the noise, the smell, the sight.\nat the end?\nThere was half a battle ceremony.\nWe gave a prayer in our hearts, we clearly expressed our desire not to leave until we reach all our brothers and sisters.\"\nAs part of the sensitive and secretive activity of the operational space fighters in the 504 Agent Activation Unit, the senior officers of the unit make it clear that the prisoners and missing persons are placed in the first order of priority in front of their eyes. \"Sometimes there was a feeling that We found a solution to the problem in the field and in the end it happened,\" stressed S. who told about the incident that strengthened him and his strength. \"We went to the mother of the late Aden Zachariah. She lost the one dearest to her. Instead of strengthening her, she strengthened us. I pledge to all parents : We will give 110 percent to find the girls and boys. We will not stop and we will not leave until the last of the abductees. Our strength is the families of the abductees.\"\nThe funeral of Eden Zacharias\nEden Zacharia's funeral, Palmachim Cemetery/Walla!\nS. also repeats the words he heard from the wife of RSV Ziv Dado. \"She said that even if the result was not the expected result, the heart was not complete until the body was returned and there was no grave.\nThat is why this is one of the most valuable tasks and it is carried out under fire in combination with the 551st Brigade and the Yalam unit, including during the rescue stages. I told this to the commander of the unit: we will stay here until the last of the abductees returns. Wherever the maneuver goes, we will be 'all in'.\"\nThe commander of the cruise said towards the end of the conversation while he was receiving updates on what was happening in the field every moment: \"It is important that everyone remember: we rescued our people who were forcibly kidnapped as civilians from a party, settlement or base. We will return them alive or dead to the grave in Israel. Only after you reach the depths of the terrain and go down, You understand how dark a place Gaza is. A kingdom of darkness. The menorah we lit there brought moral light. To some extent, we banish darkness in this place. Deep and far we pledged to bring all the boys and girls home. Despite the concealment efforts the enemy makes. Unit 504 spares no effort Not a single resource and not a single force for the needs of this mission.\"\nMore on the same topic:\n504\nAmen\nIDF\nabducted\nHamas\nGaza Strip\nGaza war\nWar of Iron Swords\nSimilar news: The magic of cinema 21 hours The tassels are the foot! 1 day",
