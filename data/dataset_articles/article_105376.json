Listen to Story In Short - India beat Australia by 3 wickets back in 2021 at the Gabba - Rishabh Pant won the Player of the Match award - Mohammed Siraj also picked up a 5-wicket haul Back on January 19, 2021, India beat Australia for the first time in a Test match at the Gabba in Brisbane. With the series level at 1-1, the visitors had a tough task at in hand as Australia have always dominated at the venue in Brisbane. However, the visitors, led by Ajinkya Rahane, defied the odds to come up trumps and win by three wickets. After opting bat first, Australia scored 369 in 115.2 overs on the back of Marnus Labuschagne’s knock of 108. Tim Paine scored 50 while Steve Smith, Matthew Wade and Cameron Green scored 36, 45 and 47 respectively. T Natarajan, Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar picked up three wickets apiece. India conceded a slender, yet crucial lead of 33 runs after being bowled out for 336 in 111.4 overs. Sundar and Thakur made 62 and 67 respectively to help India recover from 186 for six. The duo put on 123 runs for the seventh wicket. Josh Hazlewood was the star Australian bowler after he picked up five wickets for 57 runs in 24.4 overs. Australia scored 294 runs in their second innings and set India a target of 328 to chase down. Steve Smith scored 55 and was the top-scorer for the Aussies. Mohammed Siraj picked up five wickets while Thakur accounted for four scalps. Thereafter, India chased down the target in 97 overs to make history. They lost the early wicket of Rohit Sharma in their run-chase, but Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a knock of 91, laced with eight fours and two sixes. Cheteshwar Pujara made 56 runs off 211 balls to hold one end up. Then it was the turn of Rishabh Pant to show his class. The southpaw [stayed unbeaten on 89 runs](https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/rishabh-pant-revisits-his-batting-heroics-in-indias-historic-win-in-gabba-test-2357691-2023-04-09) off 138 balls as India went past the finish line in the third and final session of the fifth day’s play.",
