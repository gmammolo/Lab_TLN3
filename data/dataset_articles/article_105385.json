  "text": " liberation of our ancient capital from the Nazis became not only a significant milestone of the Great Patriotic War, but also an event of enormous symbolic and moral significance, because here, in Veliky Novgorod, a thousand-year-old Russian statehood was born, and the foundations of national culture, education, and art developed.\nPeople will never forget the feat of soldiers and officers, fighters of partisan detachments, and citizens – all those who defended and liberated Veliky Novgorod, and selflessly restored the city, its monuments and shrines, which were destroyed by the enemy who wanted not only to exterminate our people, but also to erase our history.\nOur sacred duty is to preserve the historical truth about the feat of the generation of Victors, and how their unity and team spirit helped overcome any challenges. Therefore, the efforts of all caring people who preserve the memory of the pages of the Great Patriotic War, conduct archival and search work, and revive the names of defenders of the Motherland are so important. I am confident that this huge work will continue throughout Russia, including here in the Veliky Novgorod Region.”",
