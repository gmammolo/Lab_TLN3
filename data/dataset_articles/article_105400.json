  "text": "PRIME Minister Brigadier (Ret’d) Mark Phillips delivered a stirring call for strengthened cooperation among the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) member states during its 19th Summit of Heads of States and Government in Uganda on Friday. He highlighted the theme of the summit: “Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence”, as a driving force to face the current global challenges, which have impacted the majority of countries in the world. “Our countries are still recovering from the profound and lasting impacts of the pandemic on our economies and societies,” he said. These issues, he added, are “further compounded by the devastating impacts of climate change, the proliferation of conflicts, shifts in the global economic dynamics, and growing cybersecurity threats enabled by artificial intelligence, to name but a few”. In his recommendations, he urged the NAM to remain committed to its principles, while emphasising the importance of cooperation in mitigating the challenges. “The Non-Aligned Movement must stand as a principled advocate for effective multilateralism in tackling the pressing issues of our time. In keeping with the UN Charter and the Bandung Principles, we must work tirelessly to help turn the global tide towards peace, freedom, and sustainable human progress, underpinned by a more just and inclusive international order,” he said. Prime Minister Phillips also outlined Guyana’s national priorities, which encompasses long-term sustainable development. He spoke of the country’s Low-Carbon Development Strategy 2030, its leadership of CARICOM’s 25 by 2025 food security initiative, and its pursuit of achieving over 80% renewable energy by the end of the decade. This, he underscored, positions Guyana as a willing partner for the advancement of climate action, food security and sustainable development, the major themes underpinning the summit’s focus. “Guyana stands ready as a partner in global climate action. Through our Low-Carbon Development Strategy 2030, our Government is working to protect its forests, biodiversity, and watersheds, and promote clean energy and climate adaptation, in line with commitments under the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” PM Phillips said. He explained that as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, Guyana is focused on international peace, especially when it comes to the adherence of international law and the settlements of issues between states. Guyana, he reaffirmed, is committed to the values, principles, and purposes of the Non-Aligned Movement. Prime Minister Phillips said: “Guyana underscores the critical importance of adherence to the rule of international law, political self-determination, respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. These principles must continue to guide our continued engagement and cooperation in the quest for peace and prosperity for all our peoples.” The Guyanese Prime Minister also congratulated Uganda on assuming the chairmanship of the NAM, and expressed confidence in the African country’s leadership. The two-day summit, which continues tomorrow, is taking place in Uganda’s capital city, Kampala. The Non-Aligned Movement is a forum of 120 countries that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. (Office of the Prime Minister)",
