  "text": "Iran's parliament speaker hails IRGC response to terrorist attacks\nIran Press TV\nFriday, 19 January 2024 11:14 AM\nIranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf has hailed the recent strikes conducted by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in retaliation for the terrorist attacks that were conducted in Kerman, saying they \"conveyed an important message\" to the terrorists' supporters.\nNoting that Kheibar-Shekan missiles hit a terrorist position in Syria's Idlib Province \"precisely\" from a distance of 1,250 kilometers, Qalibaf said on Thursday that the operation has not only destroyed that position but showed that Iran would harshly respond to any hostile action by their supporters.\n\"All the powers witnessed that if they make any mistake or inflict the slightest harm or damage on our country and nation, it will be enough for us to change the [missiles'] angle a little so they can see the Islamic Republic's power.\"\n\"They saw how they would be dealt with if they spied through a headquarters in Erbil,\" he added.\nQalibaf stressed that Iran's response to the recent Daesh terrorist attacks in Kerman has shown the great military capabilities of the Islamic Republic.\nHe noted that Daesh was established by the Zionist regime and the US to \"create insecurity and commit crimes\", referring to remarks made by former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally during which he said former US President Barack Obama is \"the founder of ISIS\", using another acronym for the terrorist group.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the IRGC said it fired barrages of ballistic missiles at Syrian bases of terrorists who were involved in recent terrorist attacks in Iran, as well as an Israeli espionage center in the Iraqi Kurdistan region.\nThe IRGC said the first missile strike targeted gathering places of commanders and main elements of recent terrorist attacks in the Iranian cities of Kerman and Rask.\nIt added that the strike came after gathering points of the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group were identified in the occupied territories of Syria and were destroyed with a number of ballistic missiles.\nThe IRGC said in a later statement that another missile strike had been launched at a main espionage center of the Israeli regime's Mossad spy agency in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.\nThe IRGC added that its missile strike on the Iraqi Kurdistan Region has totally destroyed the Mossad center there.\nThe IRGC also noted that the Mossad center was used \"to develop espionage operations and plan acts of terrorism\" across the region, especially in Iran.\nThe missile strike against the Mossad center, the statement said, was in retaliation for the recent assassinations of the resistance front's commanders, especially those of the IRGC, by the Zionist regime.\nNoting that the Palestinian cause is of central importance not only to the Muslim world but also to all humans across the world, Qalibaf said that it was the result of \"the culture of Jihad and martyrdom\".\n\"Today, all the people in the world are talking about Palestine and defending its nation and this is the result of that culture of Jihad and martyrdom.\"\nIsrael launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.\nSince the start of the offensive, the Tel Aviv regime has killed at least 24,620 Palestinians and injured more than 61,830 others.\nThousands more are also missing and presumed dead under the rubble in Gaza, which is under \"complete siege\" by Israel.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
