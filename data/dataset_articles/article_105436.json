  "text": "The Navy is about to name a ship in honor of Omaha’s World War II “Hero of the Solomons.” Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro announced last week that one of the next new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (DDG 142) will be named for Petty Officer 1st Class Charles Jackson French, who was born in Arkansas in 1919 but was raised by his sister in Omaha after his parents died. The Navy traditionally names its destroyers after Navy and Marine Corps heroes. Other ships in the Arleigh Burke class have been named for Revolutionary War Capt. John Paul Jones and Civil War Adm. David Farragut, known for his declaration “Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead!” Several carry the names of Medal of Honor recipients. “We’re very elated that this is happening,” said Chester French Jr., Charles French’s nephew, who lives in Omaha. “That was just, really, out of sight.” People are also reading… The 22-year-old mess attendant gained the nickname “the Human Tugboat” for jumping into the sea and towing 15 wounded shipmates in a lifeboat for hours through shark-infested waters after their ship was sunk near Japanese-occupied Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, on Sept. 5, 1942. French was Black; the wounded sailors were White. He was lauded for his actions in Omaha and across the country after one of the survivors told the story on the NBC radio network shortly after the rescue. Although he was nominated for the Navy Cross — the sea service’s second-highest valor award — the rigidly segregated Navy of that era only presented him with a letter of commendation. French remained in the Navy for the rest of the war. He died in 1956, at age 36, of alcoholism that his family linked to post-traumatic stress from his wartime military service. His obituary made no mention of his heroism. “For too long, we did not recognize Petty Officer French appropriately,” Del Toro said in announcing the naming decision this month, “but we’ve begun to correct that.” French’s story resurfaced in 2021 after Bruce Wigo, the retired CEO of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, researched and published an article about it on the organization’s website and posted links on social media. Wigo’s viral post got a response from the Navy’s chief information officer and prompted stories about French by The World-Herald and other media outlets. USA Swimming took note of his achievements during the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials in Omaha in 2021, inviting several of French’s living relatives from Omaha to attend. A year later, the post office in Benson was renamed for French in September 2022 following efforts by Nebraska’s congressional delegation. Also in 2022, the Navy finally paid tribute by renaming a training pool at Naval Base San Diego. And it recognized his bravery by awarding him the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the Navy’s highest award for noncombat heroism. Now, with the naming of a ship, French will receive one of the highest honors the Navy can present. “I appreciate the honor that my uncle is getting,” said Roscoe Harris, 91, of Omaha, who remembers being in awe of his celebrated relative as a boy. “I’m proud that he was an American, and he did what he thought was right to do.” The ship’s sponsor will be Charles French’s grandniece, Vanessa French Wilson, who was born in Omaha, served in the Navy, and now lives in Georgia. She will participate in the keel-laying of the future USS Charles J. French at the Ingalls Shipbuilding shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in 2027, smash the ceremonial champagne bottle over its bow when it is christened in 2029, and commission the ship when it joints the Navy fleet in 2031. Wilson also will engage with the Charles J. French’s future crews, as a link to the namesake ship’s family. “It’s kind of historic, because it tells the country what people of color did during the war,” Chester French Jr. said. “This is just another step in honoring him — what should have been done years ago.” [sliewer@owh.com](mailto:sliewer@owh.com); [twitter.com/Steve](http://twitter.com/Steve) Liewer",
