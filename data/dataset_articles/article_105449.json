  "text": "President Mohamed Menfi of the Presidential Council (PC) urged a united stance supporting full UN membership for Palestine during his speech at the 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, which kicked off on Friday in Uganda. In his address, Menfi said such an approach would contribute to establishing an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. He condemned the ongoing \"atrocities\" faced by Palestinians under occupation, including massacres, displacement, land usurpation, and settlement activities. \"The Palestinian issue represents the plight of people who have been under occupation for decades, facing the longest-standing refugee crisis, the most significant protection crisis, and the most extensive justice crisis in modern history.\" The summit, with broad Arab and Islamic representation, discussed ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, exceeding 100 days with over 24,000 fatalities and 61,000 injuries. Additionally, the summit addressed global crises, including the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war and its impact on grain exports, crucial for Africa and Asia.",
