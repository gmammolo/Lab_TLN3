  "text": "New Delhi, Jan 20 (IANS): Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said that machines can perform physical and intellectual tasks but cannot be creative, generate consciousness or develop interpersonal skills like humans.\n“This is where the NCC is playing a crucial role,” the Defence Minister said.\nHe said that with time and further advancements, people will begin to focus more on creating a career in sectors where machines cannot execute the desired tasks.\n“Creativity, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence and sensitivity are the qualities which will make a person relevant and employable in the present age of machines and artificial intelligence,” Singh said while addressing the NCC cadets at Delhi Cantt.\nHe appreciated the NCC for equipping the cadets with these qualities and ensuring their all-round development to lead the next generation.\n“The NCC, through its various initiatives and programmes, is ensuring holistic growth of cadets by making them physically, mentally and emotionally strong, developing their social skills and instilling the feeling of patriotism and national pride,” the Defence Minister said.\nHe said that along with studies, it is extremely important for the cadets to imbibe these qualities.\n“This will help them to give their 100 per cent in the progress of the country,” he said.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
