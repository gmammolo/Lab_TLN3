  "text": "SENEGAL qualified for the knockout stages with a game to spare by beating Cameroon 3-1 in Yamoussoukro, leaving the Indominable Lions in a perilous position, reports Vlad Andrejevic. Goals from Ismaila Sarr, Habib Diallo and Sadio Mane proved too much for Cameroon, who will likely need to win their last game against Gambia to have a chance of progressing. It only took a quarter of an hour for the defending champions to go ahead following questionable goalkeeping from the under-fire Andre Onana. As a corner came in, his clearance was unconvincing and fell to Pape Matar Sarr who managed to knock it into Ismaila Sarr’s path to smash in. Cameroon huffed and puffed in search of an equaliser but were unable to impose themselves on Senegal who seemed to be in cruise control for most of the contest. It was the Lions of Teranga who struck again in the 72nd minute, as the ball fortuitously broke to Ismaila Sarr who fizzed in a brilliant first-time cross into the path of the onrushing Diallo to slide in his first goal of the tournament. Cameroon, who have a reputation of performing best when their backs are against the wall, finally found a breakthrough themselves in the 83rd minute. Substitute Oliver Ntcham produced a wonderful cross which Jean-Charles Castelletto emphatically headed in to give Cameroon hope. They followed it up with two great chances to equalise, both falling to Georges-Kevin N’Koudou. Having been inches away from getting on the end of a dangerous cross, he headed wide from inside the six-yard area in stoppage time when it looked easier to score. Senegal’s veterans responded as Idrissa Gueye, Senegal’s record cap holder, escaped down the right and found a clever cutback for Senegal’s record goal-scorer Mane to calmly slot into the corner and put the game to bed.",
