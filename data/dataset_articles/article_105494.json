  "text": "2024-01-20 15:05:00 This Monday, the trial of the Trèbes and Carcassonne attacks will open before the special assize court in Paris. It will be without Marielle Beltrame, the widow of the gendarme killed during the attack on the Super U of Trèbes. Civilly married in 2016, Marielle and Arnaud Beltrame were to be united religiously on June 9, 2018. But the murderous journey of Radouane Lakdim decided otherwise, on this fateful March 23, 2018. That day, the terrorist had already sowed death in Carcassonne by killing Jean Mazières, 61, with a bullet in the temple, in the Aigles de la Cité parking lot, then at the Super U in Trèbes where he had shot dead ‘a bullet in the head the butcher of the establishment Christian Medves and a customer Hervé Sosna. Arriving among the first on the scene, Arnaud Beltrame took the place of a hostage held by the terrorist. The gendarme died in hospital on the night of March 23 to 24 as a result of his injuries. The terrorist was killed during the GIGN assault on the supermarket. “I know he is alive and happy where he is” As the trial of Radouane Lakdim’s alleged accomplices begins, Marielle Beltrame indicated to our colleagues at Midi Libre that she would not attend these debates which will take place for 4 to 5 weeks before the court of special meeting in Paris from Monday January 22. “Too traumatic to relive,” she told our colleagues. “I know that he is alive, and very happy where he is,” testified the woman who was able to find vital comfort with the canons of Lagrasse Abbey who were to consecrate their union.
