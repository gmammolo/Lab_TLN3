  "text": "Ivory Coast legend, Didier Drogba, says the Super Eagles of Nigeria can progress as far as winning the African Cup of Nations AFCON 2023 currently holding in his native country Ivory Coast.\nThe former Chelsea striker’s comments comes days after Nigeria humbled the hosts 1-0 thanks to William Troost-Ekong’s penalty in a match few gave Jose Peseiro’s men any chance.\nDrogba has, however, admitted that the Nigerian national team can aim for the finals of the tournament despite not being among the favourites to win the competition in an interview monitored by Official54fx.\n“They can go far,” Drogba started. “But we [Ivory Coast] have to sill finish in front of them,” the former Olympic Marseille player quipped.\n“Of course, I want Ivory Coast to win but the best team has to win, and if it is Nigeria- whichever team- fair to them and well done to them.\n“But we are going to fight till the end because we play at home and we want to show that not only can we host the competition [but can also win it].”\nNigeria is currently second ingroup A with four points from two matches, two points behind surprise leaders Equatorial Guinea who have qualified for the knockout stage.\nIvory Coast are in third place with three points and must not lose to Equatorial Guinea to have a chance of qualification to the next round.",
