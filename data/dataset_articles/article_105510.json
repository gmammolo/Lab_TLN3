  "text": "A large support rally will take place tonight at the end of Shabbat, at 19:30 at the “Hatofim Square” on Shaul Hamelech Street in Tel Aviv. During the evening, Chen Goldstein-Almog, who was freed from Hamas captivity with her three children, will sleep, and the singer Dikla and the Jewish-American singer Matisyahu will perform. At the same time as the rally, it is not expected to be quiet in Caesarea either, when a huge demonstration is planned in front of the Prime Minister’s house which will also start at 19:30. In a statement from the headquarters of the families of the abductees, it is stated that the events will take place under the demand: “Their time has come – an immediate deal!”.\nWill the door of Netanyahu’s house be blocked from the exit? The angry speech at the demonstration of the families of the kidnapped in Caesarea\nSenior IDF officials: “It is impossible to both eliminate Hamas and release hostages”\nAccording to the headquarters, the speakers will call on the Prime Minister: “For 106 days we begged you and now we demand: stop the execution of the abductees! We expect significant action and that any deal will include all the abductees: those who are alive and have managed to survive so far and also the return of the bodies to an honorable burial on the soil of our country.”\nModerator and actress Galit Gutman will moderate and open the rally, actress Yael Abkasis will reveal a surprising message, and chairman Naamat Hagit Par and Moran Zer Katzenstein, founder of Bonot Alternative will also participate in the rally. In their announcement, it is written: “Members of the families of the abductees, along with an abductee who returned from hell and representatives of organizations Women in Israel will cry out tomorrow: “If there is no agreement now, there will be no one to save!”\nAmong the speakers at the rally will be the representatives of the families: Sasha Ariev, the sister of Karina Ariev, who was kidnapped in Gaza; Shira Vali Elbag, the parents of Liri Elbag who was abducted in Gaza and Chen Goldstein Almog – who was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Kafra Gaza along with her three children. Her husband and eldest daughter were murdered on Black Saturday, and they returned from captivity.\nEarlier, the families of the abductees protested in front of the Prime Minister’s house. During their protest, the father of the abductee, Liri Elbag, harshly attacked Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, saying: “Just as Sinvar doesn’t care about the people, our ‘Sinvar’ doesn’t care about the people either. For a hundred days of grace I sat in silence, but my heart can’t anymore, I can’t anymore , and we’ll just raise the protest. I don’t want to block the Ayalon, I want to block it here, so that he won’t be able to leave, until our children leave. Until our children leave, he won’t leave.”",
