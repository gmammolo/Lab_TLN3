  "text": "- By Kamal Kumar - Published: Sat, 20 Jan 2024 09:39 PM (IST) - Source:JND Former US president Donald Trump made startling revelations during a deposition in front of a judge presiding over a fraud lawsuit case against him, saying that 'he had averted a nuclear holocaust' and 'saved millions of lives.' He also lashed out at the judge and the attorney general, while repeating the same lines. Trump's remarks came months ago while being questioned about his business practices, he said that he was 'too busy..saving millions of lives' to take stock of the business, entrusted to his children. The recently released footage of the deposition takes interesting turns at times. The former president's claims also provide a dramatic twist to the already complex legal proceedings against Trump.

I consider this the most important job in the world, saving millions of lives. I think you would've had a nuclear holocaust if I didn't deal with North Korea. I think you would've had a nuclear war if I weren't elected. And I think you might have a nuclear war now if you want to know the truth,\" he said. CBS News reported that Donald Trump, along with his two adult sons and the Trump Organization, had been found responsible for fraud even before the trial started. The case aims to address various accusations, such as falsifying business records, engaging in conspiracy, and committing insurance fraud. The attorney general's office, led by James, is pursuing $370 million in damages and is seeking sanctions, including a lifetime ban on Trump's involvement in New York real estate. The judge overseeing the case has signalled that he will announce his decision in the upcoming weeks.

When testifying in November, he labelled the case as a \"shame\" and a \"disgrace,\" insinuating that he was being penalized for his achievements.
