  "text": "Udonis Haslem and Dwyane Wade shared a moment last night while looking up at their jerseys in the rafters❤️ What a moment for the Heat legends 🙌 (via @MiamiHEAT) pic.twitter.com/Puu1KauNIK\nClutch Points:\nRumor Hype Rumor visits per day for the last week\nViews per day\nJanuary 20, 2024 | 11:02 am EST Update\n<a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/rumor/blazers-sign-taze-moore-to-10-day-contract/\">\nBlazers sign Taze Moore to 10-day contract </a>\nAdrian Wojnarowski: The Portland Trail\nBlazers are signing G Taze Moore of the G League’s Rip City Remix on a 10-day contract,sources tell ESPN. Moore played his college basketball for Kelvin Sampson at Houston.\nJorge Sierra:\nKevin Durant passed Hassan Whiteside in blocks and Dominique Wilkins in rebounds last night. Just so you know.\nMichael Scotto:\nCam Thomas: “I feel like the goal post always moves for me. When people now score all these points, it’s all praise. But when I used to do it, it’s always a knock.He can’t play defense. He doesn’t pass. But when I see other people doing the same thing, it’s praise.” pic.twitter.com/FqwnMJF9El\nFormer NBA star\nDeMarcus Cousins’ double-double debut saw the Taiwan Beer Leopards secure a 119-90 blowout win against the Tainan TSG GhostHawks on Saturday. The Leopards improved to 9-4 after the game, tying the New Taipei CTBC DEA atop the five-team T1 LEAGUE on the back of a franchise-record five-game winning streak. The 6,015 spectators who turned up for Cousin’s debut also set a new attendance record for the Leopards at the Taoyuan Arena, the franchise’s home since last summer. Cousins logged 13 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, two steals, and one block in 28:24 on the floor — a performance the four-time NBA All-Star suggested he could exceed with adequate rest. “I’m jet-lagged; I just got off a 14-hour flight. I’ll get some recovery after this game, get my legs fresh, and be ready for tomorrow. So hopefully, it’s a better performance,” the 33-year-old center said after the game.\nUdonis Haslem spent 20 seasons wearing a Miami Heat jersey. Now, his jersey will forever hang from the rafters in the Heat’s home arena. During a halftime ceremony in the middle of Friday night’s game between the Heat and Atlanta Hawks at Kaseya Center, Haslem’s No. 40 jersey was retired by the organization. Haslem, 43, became the sixth Heat player to have his jersey retired, joining Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway, Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n“Look at the list of the guys I’m sitting with,” Haslem said, referring to the first five Heat players who had their jerseys retired and are already in the Basketball Hall of Fame. “That’s what’s huge to me.That’s what makes me feel so amazing is the core group of guys that I’m sitting with. Pat Riley ain’t just putting anybody up there. The Arisons ain’t just OK’ing anybody to go up in those rafters.”\nHaslem, who was born at Miami’s North Shore Medical Center and grew up in Liberty City before playing at Miami High, then dedicated a part of his speech to his hometown of Miami — the area code 305.\n“Liberty City, Overtown, Little Havana, Little Haiti, everybody, tonight when this jersey goes up in the rafters, all of y’all coming with me,” Haslem said during the speech.“The love y’all show me in this city, I love you guys, I appreciate you guys. …. 305, you got to hold it up. You got to hold up the 305. Tonight, we all celebrate, 305.” Even though Haslem’s playing career is over and his Heat jersey is now retired, he’ll remain around the organization.The Heat hired him as the vice president of basketball development in November and he still hopes to become part of the Heat’s ownership group one day. “To be able to get out, make it, excel and succeed, I hope it’s a great example for other kids in Miami, in Liberty City and for my kids, as well,” Haslem said. “… This is a dream come true.”\nJanuary 20, 2024 | 10:28 am EST Update\n<a href=\"https://hoopshype.com/rumor/wizards-to-sign-trey-jemison/\">\nWizards sign Trey Jemison </a>\nShams Charania: The Washington\nWizards plan to sign center Trey Jemison to a 10-day contract out of the NBA G League’s Birmingham Squadronsources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium.
