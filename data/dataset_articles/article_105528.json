  "text": "Vice President William Lai’s (賴清德) victory in the presidential election was a rejection of China’s pressure and interference and a reaffirmation of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy. It also challenges China’s expansionist ambitions in the South and East China seas, where Beijing has asserted its territorial claims and maritime rights, often at the expense of its neighbors. Taiwan, which controls several islands and reefs in the disputed waters, is strengthening ties with the US and other like-minded countries, such as Japan and Australia, to counter China’s aggression and influence. China’s first response to Lai’s victory was to poach the allegiance of Nauru, a Pacific island nation that switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China on Monday. This was a symbolic gesture to demonstrate China’s global sway and to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Taiwan at present has formal relations with only 12 nations, mostly in Africa, Latin America and the Pacific. However, China also signaled a shift in its approach to Taiwan, emphasizing peaceful unification rather than a military solution. This reflects China’s domestic constraints, such as slowing economic growth, rising social unrest and COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) might not want to risk a confrontation with Taiwan and the US, which has pledged to support Taiwan’s security and defense under the Taiwan Relations Act and the “six assurances.” China is likely to continue coercing Taiwan through actions such as military exercises and “gray zone” tactics near the Taiwan Strait, and imposing sanctions and trade barriers on non-essential Taiwanese goods. However, China would also avoid crossing the red line that both Taipei and Washington respect — no unilateral changes to the “status quo.” This means China would not militarily annex Taiwan, nor would Taiwan declare formal independence. Both countries would maintain a delicate balance in their cross-strait relations. Khedroob Thondup is a former member of the Tibetan parliament in exile. The Generalissimo’s Garden in Taoyuan’s Dasi District (大溪) is an absurd, tragicomic collection of about 200 retired statues of former president Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石). Yet a mere hour’s drive away in central Taipei are the sprawling grounds of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. These two scenes embody Taiwan’s contemporary identity crisis — the result of a populace which until recently was starved of political and civic power. To have any chance of survival, we must first reach a consensus on what being “Taiwanese” means. Like Taiwan, Singapore’s de facto independence was not so long ago. Much like Taiwanese, Singaporeans were forced Taiwan smoothly completed its presidential and legislative elections, demonstrating its mature democracy and triumph over China’s coercive interference and threats. However, as no party has a majority in the new legislature, the election has created a new “two big and one small” political scenario. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman and Vice President William Lai (賴清德) won the presidency, delivering his party a record third consecutive term in office, the first since the country’s first direct presidential election in 1996. Voters have clearly shown resistance to China’s coercive interference, and endorsed Lai’s plan to continue President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) strategy of facing As we enter the new year, I want to focus on several areas of concern to those of us hoping for greater tranquility and cooperation throughout the region. This is a theme I have written upon before, but it seems worth returning to the subject, since 2024 could very well be a rocky time for the island state. The fact of the matter is the People’s Republic of China appears firmly under the autocratic hand of Chairman/President Xi Jinping (習近平). I use the word “appears” because the inner workings of the country are difficult for outsiders to fully grasp. That said, Xi There is an expression in Chinese, yinjian buyuan (殷鑒不遠), meaning “[the lessons of the fall of] the Yin Dynasty [also known as Shang Dynasty] are still fresh in the memory.” It is a reminder of recent historical precedent serving as a lesson that it would be foolish to ignore. Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) failed in his bid to win the presidency in Saturday’s election, garnering 26.46 percent of the vote. Given that this was his first presidential election, and that he was up against the established and well-resourced Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT),",
