  "text": "Racing will therefore see the round of 16 of the Champions Cup which will be played on the weekend of April 6 and 7.\nWith three defeats in four matches, it's quite fortunate but the Ile-de-France residents had the merit of taking advantage of the formula of this European Cup which will undoubtedly find its appeal in the spring.\nThe success against Cardiff (48-26) at Paris La Défense Arena this Saturday afternoon is enough, for the moment, for their happiness.\nEspecially since their fate did not depend solely on them.\nIt took a victory for Harlequins in front of the Irish province of Ulster (47-19) just before kick-off for the Ciel et Blanc horizon to clear up.\nA success against the very weak Welsh of Cardiff allowing them to slip into the round of 16.\nEasy.\nToo easy ?\nStill, the Ile-de-France residents experienced some ignition problems.\nStung by a try from the Carre piler under their posts (8th) and heckled by the liveliness of the Welsh, Stuart Lancaster's players took advantage of their superior power and the defensive largesse of Cardiff to take their destiny in their hands.\nThe English manager had lined up his big team with Gaël Fickou, Cameron Woki, Nolann Le Garrec, Antoine Gibert, four of the five Racingmen (Thomas Laclayat had been left to rest) selected from the list of 34 called by Fabien Galthié in order to prepare for the Tournament of the Six Nations which begins for the Blues on February 2 in Marseille against Ireland.\nThey were a bit timid before joining the gathering of the XV of France this Sunday in Marcoussis (Essonne) but Racing still avoided too long a suspense.\nAt half-time, it already seemed out of reach of the Welsh (20-12) thanks to three tries from Kamikamica (18th), Kolisi (25th) and Tabuavou (32nd).\nThe offensive bonus point was picked up after returning from the locker room on a nice slalom from fullback Tristan Tedder (43rd).\nAnd the open house operation, a bad habit of a defenseless Welshman, continued quietly, even winning over Racing by contagion.\nThe Ciel et Blanc therefore finished fourth in their group and this poor ranking is not without consequences.\nThey will have to move to one of the first groups, a big arm which could be Toulouse or Leinster for example.\nAnother story.\nDots\nRacing 92:\n7 tries from Kamikamica (18th), Kolisi (25th), Tabuavou (32nd), Tedder (43rd), Wade (47th), Baudonne (50th), Tarrit (76th), 5 conversions from Tedder (18th, 43rd, 47th, 50th, 76th), 1 penalty from Le Garrec (5th)\nCardiff:\n4 tries from Carre (8th), T. Williams (38th, 64th), De Beer (72nd), 3 conversions from De Beer",
