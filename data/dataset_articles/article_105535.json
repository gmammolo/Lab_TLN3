  "text": "With testimonies from MSF in Gaza, this show is dedicated to those who put humanity at the centre.\nOver 24,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of this war, catalysed by Hamas, between Israel and Palestine. 70% of these are women and children. Over 7,000 people are under rubble. About 2 million people, about 85% of the population, are forcibly displaced. And the atrocious statistics keep on building.\nIn this conversation I talk to the Luxembourg Director of\nMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors without Borders), Thomas Kauffmann. We also have testimony from MSF workers on the ground in Gaza. Naturally in a situation of this magnitude there are losses of the MSF workforce too, alongside other humanitarian workers.\n\"Where is the international community?\"\nSari Sisalem, a Palestinian resident in Luxembourg, is an International Development Specialist who worked on peace building projects between Palestinians and Israelis with a focus on water, energy, food security and climate change. He talks deeply about what it is like for his family and friends who are living through this in Gaza, and how they feel ignored by the international community as this is allowed to continue.\nNathalie Oberweis is a member of the board of\nComité pour une Paix Juste au Proche-Orient for the last 14 years and talks about her constant commitment to working for peace in that region. They organise peaceful marches every Saturday in Luxembourg.\nJoining these guests is\nEmanuele Santi, co-founder and President of Afrilanthropy, a Luxembourg based charity incubating social innovations in Africa. Emanuele and his wife lived in Tunisia during the onset of the Arab Spring, and turned this first hand witness, undercover blog, into a book recounting the many heroes whose collective effort led to the Revolution. They saw, through this time, the power of the people when they rise together. The voices of the 'voiceless', so often assumed, can have impact.\n\"Nearly a decade ago during these very days, Tunisia experienced one of the most exciting moments of the world’s recent history. A popular revolt uniting all members of the Tunisian society toppled a longstanding dictator and triggered a wave of restlessness across North Africa and the Middle East, starting a common quest for freedom and dignity that was later labeled the Arab Spring.\"\nYou can buy the book, Fear No More: Voices of the Tunisian Revolution at a large online bookstore, or at Ernster in Luxembourg, to support local bookshops.\nRevenues from the book sale will be devoted entirely social projects the authors are supporting.\nSubscribe to the Podcast and get in touch!\nYou can subscribe to my podcast on\nApple and Spotify. Please do rate and review too!\nTune in on\nToday Radio Saturdays at 11am, Sundays at noon and Tuesdays at 10am.",
