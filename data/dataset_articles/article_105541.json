  "text": "WE welcome the recent statements by the Philippines and China calling for diplomacy to address simmering issues between them. Although it is not exactly a breakthrough, this could turn into an opportunity to de-escalate tensions that threaten to keep the Philippines from realizing its economic aspirations.\nScreengrab from Philippine Coast Guard Video shows a Chinese Coast Guard ship using a water cannon on a Philippine vessel near Scarborough Shoal. Handout / Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) At a meeting on the West Philippine Sea (WPS) in Shanghai, Filipino and Chinese diplomats agreed that closer dialogue was needed to deal with \"maritime emergencies\" in the disputed territories. Bilateral relations between the Philippines and China have been frayed following repeated encounters at sea. The Philippines has filed countless diplomatic protests, but China just ignores them. Worse, both countries have been flexing their respective military muscle, mainly by conducting competing military drills around contested waters.\nThe Philippines makes up for its military inferiority by renewing ties with allies, including the United States, Japan and others supporting its rights under international law. China, too, argues that it is just protecting its own rights. But its expansive claim to the WPS, which is part of the larger South China Sea, is problematic and indefensible because it covers the exclusive economic zone of several countries in Southeast Asia.\nAt that Shanghai meeting, officially called the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea, both sides agreed \"that maintaining communication and dialogue is essential to maintaining maritime peace and stability,\" China's Foreign Ministry said. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila echoed that, saying the two countries \"agreed that continuous dialogue is important to keep peace and stability at sea\" and \"assured each other of their mutual commitment to avoid escalation of tensions.\"",
