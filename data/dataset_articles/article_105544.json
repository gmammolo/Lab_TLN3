  "text": "AROUND 107 families from the suburbs of Cabadbaran City, Agusan del Norte — some of whom had been displaced by conflict — were set to improve their harvest-processing capacity after receiving post-harvest machinery from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\nResidents of Sitio Lusong in Barangay Puting Bato received a corn sheller and corn mill from the ICRC during a handover ceremony in December 2023 that was attended by officials of the local government unit (LGU) and the City Agriculture Office of Cabadbaran.\nFARM EQUIPMENT TURNOVER Ishfaq Muhammad Khan (2nd from right), head of the International Committee of the Red Cross’s Butuan office, joins villagers in the inspection of farm equipment — a corn sheller and corn mill — donated by the ICRC during formal turnover at Sitio Lusong of Barangay Puting Bato in Cabadbaran City, Agusan del Norte, in December 2023. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO The ICRC worked with the LGU of Agusan del Norte to complete the project.\nApart from equipment, displaced families and host residents received food rations, farm tools, and seeds such as maize, beans and squash.\nLast year, 107 households were trained by the ICRC and the City Agriculture Office of Cabadbaran on contouring techniques, intercropping and post-harvest management techniques.",
