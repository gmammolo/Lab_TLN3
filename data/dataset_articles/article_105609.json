  "text": "By Michael Katz | Thursday, 18 January 2024 10:46 PM EST North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who ended his long shot bid for the Republican presidential nomination in early December, told Newsmax on Thursday it's time the party comes together and throws its full support behind former President Donald Trump. Burgum told \"Greg Kelly Reports\" that after next week's first-in-the-nation New Hampshire presidential primary, which he predicted Trump will win, Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis should drop out of the race so the party can begin the campaign against President Joe Biden. \"We all had our shot,\" Burgum said. \"The folks that are still in it had their shot. The evidence is clear: President Trump is leading in all 50 states. Let's move on from this primary and get focused on winning the White House and get our country going in the right direction in November.\" Burgum said he and his wife, Kathryn, campaigned for Trump in Iowa, where the former president won the caucuses in a landslide, and they are campaigning for him in New Hampshire. He said they saw the resiliency in Iowa of Trump supporters who turned out despite subzero temperatures and bitter wind and snow to deliver a record-breaking victory for the former president. \"The voter intensity and support for President Trump is really incredible,\" Burgum said. \"... If President Trump wins in New Hampshire, I think we should just say, 'Let's go, we've got the candidate, he's leading in all 50 states.' The sooner we start spending money against Joe Biden and stop spending money — Republicans attacking Republicans, classic mistake we make — the better chance we have of getting our country going in the right direction again because under Joe Biden, the world is less safe.\" About NEWSMAX TV: NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!
