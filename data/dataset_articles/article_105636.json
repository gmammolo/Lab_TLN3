  "text": "‘We Got There On Pure Character’: Ukrainian Bradley Crew Speaking About Defeating T-90M ‘Proryv’ [18](/en/news/2024/1/20/580192/comments/#comments) - 20.01.2024, 14:43 - 9,668 For the commander and driver, this was the second combat appearance. During the fighting in the Avdiivka direction, the Ukrainian military destroyed the Russian T-90M Proryv tank. Defenders of Ukraine using an M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle neutralized the vehicle of the Russian Armed Forces. In a [TSN](https://youtu.be/o7OUwn1p0q8) report, the crew revealed the details. Ukrainian fighters on an M2A2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle had to face a Russian tank at a distance of about 150 meters. As a result of the battle, the turret on the T-90M Proryv became jammed, and the vehicle itself was finished off with an FPV drone. The American infantry fighting vehicle was led by commander-gunner Serhiy and driver-mechanic Oleksandr. Journalists note that this was the crew’s second combat mission on the Bradley. In December, Serhiy just returned from training in Germany. “I can’t tell you what it’s like when you see a tank through the sights. I said during the exercises: “God forbid that I see a tank through the sights.” It just so happened that I saw it (laughs). Too close. The first crew arrived there, but something didn’t work out for them. Then we had to go there on pure character,” says commander Serhiy. At first the enemy tank was hit with armor-piercing shells, but certain difficulties arose. Therefore, the military had to improvise and they decided to “blind” the T-90M. To do this, they loaded high-explosive fragmentation shells and hit the optics of the Russian Proryv. “They hit everyone... Once I played computer games, I remembered everything. How to hit those tanks, and where to hit them, because I had to stop it at any cost,” the fighter continued. Oleksandr says that he used to be a driver of a regular car, and Serhiy was an assault soldier. After health problems, he was transferred to work on Bradley. On that day, infantry fighting vehicles covered the infantry because the T-90M could work against them. According to Oleksandr, it was very scary, but they did a good job. It is important to note that on January 19, the 47th brigade showed the crew of the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which crashed the Russian T-90M. It was also reported that, according to analysts from Forbes, the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle is the best vehicle in the arsenal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
