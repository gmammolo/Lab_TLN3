  "text": "The Palestinians “\nhave the right to sovereignty and to a state\n”, declared the head of French diplomacy Stéphane Séjourné on Saturday, after the Israeli Prime Minister reaffirmed his opposition to “\nPalestinian sovereignty\n” in Gaza.\n“\nFrance will remain faithful to its commitment to achieve this goal\n,” continues Stéphane Séjourné on X (formerly twitter).\nThe French minister's tweet comes after statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposed to Palestinian sovereignty in Gaza and believing that Israel must retain “\ncontrol of the security of the\nPalestinian territory”.\nIsrael must “\nensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat\n” and this requirement “\ncontradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty\n”, explained Benjamin Netanyahu during a telephone interview on Friday with US President Joe Biden, according to the Prime Minister's Office .\nThe United States and Europe are pleading in favor of a two-state solution, which is opposed by the Israeli government, engaged in a war against Palestinian Hamas in Gaza, after the bloody October 7 attack carried out by the terrorist movement in Israel.\nThis unprecedented attack led to the death of 1,140 people, the majority civilians, according to an AFP count.\nThe Israeli response in Gaza has left nearly 25,000 dead, the vast majority of them women, children and adolescents, according to the Hamas Ministry of Health.",
