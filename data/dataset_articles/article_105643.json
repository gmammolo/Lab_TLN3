  "text": "“Dear comrades! I congratulate everyone on the holiday, thank you for your dedicated service and military work. I am confident that you will continue to do everything to protect the interests of Russia,” the text of the minister’s congratulations says. Shoigu focused on the fact that during the Northern Military District military personnel of the engineering troops show dedication and courage. In addition, according to him, the system of engineering barriers erected by the Russian military played a key role in thwarting the offensive plans of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Earlier, the head of the Karbyshev Military Engineering Academy, Major General Andrei Kruglov, said that military engineers installed about 1.5 million “dragon teeth” on the contact line in the special operation zone. German journalist Julian Röpke noted that Western military equipment cannot overcome such structures of the Russian Armed Forces. He linked the failure of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ counter-offensive to this very problem.",
