  "text": "Kuwait’s al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Saturday that significant progress has been made in preventing a potential Israeli war on Lebanon. According to the publication, confidential discussions held outside of Lebanon have nearly succeeded in averting the escalation of the conflict into Lebanon, following confirmations that none of the involved parties desire such a war.\nThe newspaper highlighted the role of a high-profile individual who effectively leveraged his extensive connections with U.S. President Joe Biden to influence the situation. Al-Anbaa further reported that U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein is expected to revisit Beirut to broaden the scope of negotiations, aiming to reach a consensus on the land border between Israel and Lebanon.\nThe newspaper underscored the importance of gaining a commitment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to adhere to any agreements reached. This commitment is seen as crucial for enabling the return of settlers in northern Israel to their homes and facilitating the return of Lebanese displaced by the conflict to border regions.",
