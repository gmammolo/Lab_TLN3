  "text": " Women leading the path to peace: the Mother’s Call of Palestinian and Israeli women by M.H. (Women of the Sun) and Yael Braudo-Bahat (Women Wage Peace) Photo: Gal Moenson IN THE ever-challenging landscape of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where tensions persist and the hope for peace often feels distant, a remarkable glimmer emerges from an unexpected place: the resilience and determination of women. Despite the barriers of political divide and historical animosity, Palestinian and Israeli women are quietly building connections, bridging gaps and working towards a shared goal — peace.\nAt the forefront of this grassroots partnership are two movements: Women of the Sun and Women Wage Peace. United by a common vision of peace and justice, these women-led organisations are challenging stereotypes and reshaping the narrative of the conflict.\nWomen of the Sun, based in Bethlehem, embodies the strength of Palestinian women in the face of adversity. Founded on empowerment and solidarity, the organisation supports Palestinian women politically, economically and socially. Through leadership training, vocational programmes, and advocacy, Women of the Sun is nurturing a new generation of leaders driving positive change.\nOn the other side of the divide, Women Wage Peace is a diverse grassroots movement of Israeli women from all walks of life. Driven by the belief that peace is possible, the movement mobilises women across Israel to demand a political agreement. With a focus on dialogue, education and advocacy, Women Wage Peace challenges narratives of war and division, advocating for a future of peace, security, and prosperity for all.\nWhat distinguishes these movements is their emphasis on women’s voices and experiences in the peacebuilding process. Recognising the unique perspective and contributions of women, both Women of the Sun and Women Wage Peace are amplifying women’s voices, advocating for their inclusion in decision-making processes, and championing their role as agents of change.\nCentral to this historic partnership between the two Israeli and Palestinian movements is the Mother’s Call. This joint initiative, born out of a shared commitment to peace and reconciliation, calls on leaders on both sides to return to the negotiation table and work towards a peaceful resolution. The Mother’s Call is a powerful testament to the resilience, courage and determination of women in the pursuit of peace.\nAs we reflect on the contributions of Palestinian and Israeli women to peacebuilding efforts, it becomes clear that women are not just victims of conflict — they are also catalysts for change, architects of peace, and guardians of hope. By elevating women’s voices, empowering women leaders, and fostering cross-border solidarity, Women of the Sun and Women Wage Peace, through their Mother’s Call, are paving the way for a brighter, more peaceful future for all.\nOn October 4 2023, a significant event took place in Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, where hundreds of Palestinian and Israeli women marched together, calling for negotiations. Sadly, just three days later, on October 7, everything unravelled, and women from both movements lost their lives. This tragedy underscores the urgency of our joint mission. Without a courageous political solution, the cycle of bloodshed will persist and our children will continue to pay the price. As mothers, we yearn to embrace our children, not bury them. It is our responsibility to protect them.\nIn the words of Leymah Gbowee, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and women’s rights activist: “The world will never know peace until women’s voices are heard.” It is time to heed the call of Palestinian and Israeli women, listen to their stories, and join them in their quest for peace. For in their hands lies the promise of a better tomorrow — a tomorrow where peace reigns supreme, and the voices of women echo across the land, calling for justice, reconciliation and healing.\nM.H. (Women of the Sun) and Yael Braudo-Bahat (Women Wage Peace) Women of the Sun and Women Wage Peace are nominated to the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize and included in the 2024 Time Magazine Women of the Year List.",
