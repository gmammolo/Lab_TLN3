  "text": "President Droupadi Murmu on March 8 presented the President's Standard and Colours to four Indian Air Force units which she termed a \"historic occasion\".\nTwo squadrons — 45 Squadron and the 221 Squadron — received the President's Standard while the 11 Base Repair Depot and 509 signal unit received the President's Colours at a ceremony held at the Hindan Air Force Station in Ghaziabad.\nThis is the first time that four units of the IAF have received the President's Standard and Colours together, an official statement said.\nThe President's Standard and Colours is the highest military honour for any armed forces unit. The four units selected for the coveted awards have stellar contributions to the IAF's history, it said.\nIndian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal V. R. Chaudhari, Union Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways and Civil Aviation, Gen (retd) V. K. Singh, among other dignitaries were also present on the occasion.\nBefore the arrival of Ms. Murmu, a group of IAF contingents regaled the spectators with a band display followed by a ceremonial parade.\nFour personnel, two of them carrying an encased Standard each, and the rest an encased Colour each, then placed them over a stack of drums in a nod to military traditions.\n#WATCH | Indian Air Force 45 Sqn and 221 Sqn receive their President's Standards while 509 SU and 11 BRD receive the President's Colours from the President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Droupadi Murmu in a President's Standards and Colours Presentation ceremony at Air… pic.twitter.com/tTEmMVxXL4\n— ANI (@ANI) March 8, 2024",
