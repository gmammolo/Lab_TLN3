  "text": "The United Kingdom has significantly escalated its support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion by announcing a new support package worth 381 million euros to supply over 10,000 drones to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This announcement was made by Defence Secretary Grant Shapps during his third visit to Ukraine, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov to reaffirm the UK's steadfast commitment to Ukraine.\nFollow Army Recognition on Google News at this link\nA soldier from the 21 Air Assault Battery, 32 Royal Artillery Regiment, launches a Puma Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) in 2023 (Picture source: UK MoD )\nThe increased funding, now totaling around €381 million, represents a significant ramp-up from the initial announcement of €234 million made by the Prime Minister in January. It aims to provide a wide range of unmanned platforms, predominantly first-person view (FPV) drones, 1,000 one-way attack drones developed in the UK, as well as surveillance and maritime drones.\nThese new drones, emerging directly from the UK's leading defense industry, are expected to be delivered throughout 2024, bolstering Ukrainian capabilities on the battlefield. According to Shapps, the goal is to arm Ukraine with cutting-edge technology, while also encouraging international partners to support this effort.\nThe effective use of various types of drones by the Ukrainian Armed Forces has already garnered attention, with these devices enabling the destruction and damage of thousands of Russian equipment and vehicles at a significantly lower cost. FPV drones, in particular, have proven effective in circumventing Russian air defenses to hit their targets, providing critical situational awareness to target enemy positions and armored vehicles.\nThis announcement follows a meeting of the US-led Ukraine Defence Contact Group, which brings together over 50 countries providing military support to Ukraine. The UK, in collaboration with Latvia, will lead an international coalition aimed at enhancing Ukraine's drone capabilities.\nThe Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have both highlighted the importance of rallying international support for Ukraine and last month, the Defence Secretary called on NATO allies to further intensify their commitment during a meeting of the alliance's ministers.\nThis significant contribution from the UK, with an investment of over €117 million in maritime capabilities, aims to continue changing the course of the conflict in the Black Sea in favor of Ukraine.",
