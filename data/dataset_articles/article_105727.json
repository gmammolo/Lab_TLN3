Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala delivers a speech as part of a joint press statement with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., at Malacanang Palace, in Manila, Philippines, April 17, 2023. Ezra Acayan/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech-led initiative to buy ammunition for Ukraine as it battles Russia's invasion has raised enough so far to purchase a first batch of 300,000 artillery shells, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on X social media platform on Friday.\n\"Our goal is to deliver much more!\" he said. \"Our work and our help to Ukraine do not end here. We keep seeking partners so that we can continue to support Ukraine in its brave fight against the Russian aggressor.\"\nCzech President Petr Pavel had said on Thursday the initiative had collected the amount needed for acquiring 800,000 ammunition pieces that had earlier been found and were available from unspecified countries outside Europe.\nA government adviser was Quote: d as saying in Czech media on Thursday evening, after Pavel had spoken of secured financing, that the full purchase was still not covered and there was no target amount in the initiative.\nPavel had last month said 500,000 rounds of 155-calibre ammunition and 300,000 rounds of 122-calibre ammunition were available and could be delivered with secured funding.\nSeveral European Union members and countries outside the bloc have made pledges to the ammunition drive for Ukraine, as fighting against Russia's full-scale invasion hits a third year.\nIt comes as the EU will miss a year-old target to deliver one million ammunition rounds to Ukraine this month and as U.S. military aid, which has been the backbone of international support for Kyiv, has stalled.\nNorway said on Thursday it would donate up to 1.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) for the Czech plan. That followed pledges by Germany and France this week.\nPavel said on Thursday that 18 countries had joined the initiative.\nUkraine ammunition drive raises enough to buy first 300,000 shells, Czech PM says",
