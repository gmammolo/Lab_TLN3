  "text": "Direct Baku-Yerevan talks, durable peace will promote development in Caucasus: Iran's defense minister\nIran Press TV\nThursday, 07 March 2024 7:50 AM\nIran's Defense Minister Brigadier General Mohammad-Reza Ashtiani says Tehran supports sustainable peace and direct negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve the disputes in the Caucasus region.\nIn a meeting with Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan in Tehran on Wednesday, Ashtiani said security in the region must be ensured through regional mechanisms.\nHe warned against the adverse consequences of attempts by extra-regional countries to gain a foothold in Caucasus, adding that it would turn the region into a place of conflict among powers and cause more challenges to security and stability.\nThe Caucasus region must not turn into a battleground for others as it would jeopardize stability and security of all countries, the Iranian defense chief emphasized.\nSituated in the South Caucasus, the landlocked region of Nagorno-Karabakh has been at the heart of a long-running dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\nAzerbaijan took full control of the breakaway Karabakh region in September following a 24-hour military operation against pro-Armenian forces.\nAlso in his remarks, Ashtiani said the expansion of relations with all neighboring countries is among the principles of Iran's foreign policy.\nPointing to Armenia's special importance in Iran's ties with its neighbors, Ashtiani said the two countries have always enjoyed developing relations in various fields.\nHe added that Iran's policy is to support a comprehensive and sustainable peace in the region\nIran's firm stance is to support the territorial integrity of regional countries and their right to sovereignty without any change in the internationally recognized borders, he pointed out.\nThe Iranian defense minister also stressed the need to ensure regional security by the countries in the region and voiced Tehran's strong objection to any approach contrary to the policy.\nPapikyan, for his part, pointed to deep-rooted historical friendship between Iran and Armenia and highlighted the significance of both sides' common stance on regional stability.\nThe Armenian defense minister urged the two countries to make more efforts to strengthen relations.\nArmenia agrees with Iran's stance on promotion of peace and cordial relations between Yerevan and Baku, he added.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
