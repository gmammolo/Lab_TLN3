  "text": "Zelenskiy Hails Sweden's NATO Entry, Eyes Day Ukraine Might Also Join\nBy RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service March 07, 2024\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Sweden's entry into the NATO military alliance, largely viewed as a reaction to Russia's invasion of his country in 2022, saying the Scandinavian country was a \"strong ally and a country that can be trusted.\"\nZelenskiy, who seeks eventual NATO membership for Ukraine, added that \"there will be a day when Sweden will be able to congratulate Ukraine on joining the alliance as well. Together, we are always stronger.\"\nSweden joined NATO in Washington on March 7, two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced it to rethink its national security policy and conclude that support for the alliance was the nation's best safety guarantee.\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson handed over final documentation to the U.S. government, the last step in a long process to secure the backing of all members to join the alliance.\n\"Good things come to those who wait,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\"Today is a truly historic day,\" Kristersson said. \"Sweden is now a member of NATO. We will defend freedom together with the countries closest to us -- both in terms of geography, culture and values.\"\nWith reporting by Reuters\nSource:\nhttps://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-sweden- nato-zelenskiy/32853007.html\nCopyright (c) 2024.
