  "text": "Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Dončić has been stuffing the stat sheet of late, and he played a crucial role in the team’s victory over the Miami Heat on Thursday night.\nIn the win, Dončić recorded 35 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists. It was the fifth game in a row the 24-year-old recorded a triple-double, and he made NBA history with his latest statistical feat.\nDončić became the first player in league history to record four consecutive triple-doubles with 35 or more points in each game, according to ESPN’s Tim MacMahon . Over his last four games, Dončić has totaled 149 points, 43 assists and 44 rebounds. Despite his all-around dominance, the Mavericks are 1-3 during that four-game stretch, including Thursday’s victory.\nEarlier this week, Dončić joined the likes of Michael Jordan, Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook in league history by becoming the fourth player to record four-straight 30-point triple-doubles. He now stands alone in the record books after adding a fourth consecutive 35-point triple-double on Thursday.\nIncluding the current stretch of four in a row, Dončić now has nine 35-point triple-doubles this season. He’ll look to continue his streak on Saturday when Dallas takes on the Detroit Pistons .",
