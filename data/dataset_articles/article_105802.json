  "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday pledged his country's \"unwavering support\" for Moldova as tensions mount between the eastern European country and pro-Russian separatists.\n\"France restates its unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders,\" he said in a joint statement with Moldovan President Maia Sandu as she visited Paris.\nTwo years into Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Moldova faces \"multiple challenges caused by the conflict on its borders\", the statement said.\nTop of the list is the pro-Russian breakway region of Transnistria, where officials last week appealed to Moscow for \"protection\".\nThere is mounting concern that the territory could become a new flashpoint in the conflict, with Moldova \"facing intensifying hybrid attacks\", the two presidents said.\nThe two presidents signed a Chisinau-Paris defence deal as well as an \"economic roadmap\".\n\"The Moldovan state must be in a position to protect its neutrality, defend its territory and its population, and contribute to regional and international security,\" they said in the statement.\nMacron and Sandu said Paris was \"fully backing\" Moldova's reforms aimed at one day joining the European Union. It is to hold a referendum later this year.\n\"Justice reform and the battle against corruption\" would be particularly important to a successful membership bid, they added.\ngbh/ah/tw\nCurrent Contests Bozeman Win tickets to Menopause the Musical 2 Three winners will receive a pair of ticket to Menopause the Musical 2 at the Brick on the campus of MSU on Wednesday, March 13.\nOriginally published on doc.afp.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .",
