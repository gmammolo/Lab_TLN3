  "text": "The Telegraph Follow Britain’s lead and give more to Ukraine, Shapps says in Kyiv Read full article Cameron Henderson March 8, 2024 at 5:14 p.m. · 15 min read Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meets with British Defence Secretary Grant Shapps in Kyiv - REUTERS Grant Shapps, the UK defence secretary, has urged Western nations to copy Britain’s example by stepping up their support for Ukraine.\nIn a video posted on social media, Mr Shapps can be seen walking in front of a destroyed tank in Kyiv as he issues a “wake up call” to the world to ensure Vladimir Putin is defeated.\n“I’m in Kyiv to raise the alarm to the democratic world - we must make sure Ukraine wins this war,” said Mr Shapps. “The UK has stepped up to do more than ever, with our largest military support package to date. Every nation must now do the same and ensure freedom triumphs over tyranny.”\nThe defence secretary encouraged Britain’s allies to reflect on their democratic values, asking: “What would it say if we allow a democratic country to be taken over by a dictator?”\nMr Shapps yesterday met with President Zelensky in Kyiv, where he announced Britain’s pledge to purchase an additional 10,000 drones for Ukraine, worth £325 million.\nFollow the latest updates below\n03:13 PM GMT That’s all for today Thank you for tuning in to today’s live blog.

Luxembourg has joined a Czech-led coalition of European nations supplying ammunition to Ukraine, Yuriko Backes, the country’s foreign minister, said.\nMr Backes added that Luxembourg has recently delivered 6,000 155mm shells to Ukraine.\nThe announcement comes after the group of countries revealed they purchased 800,000 artillery shells for Ukraine.\nSee post at 10.28am for more information.\n01:50 PM GMT Ukrainian drone strike kills two, Russia claims A Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian border region of Belgorod has killed two people, the Russian governor said.\nThree Ukrainian “kamikaze drones” hit the village of Rozhdestvenska, Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a post on Telegram.\n“As a result of the explosions, two people were killed and a third man was serious wounded,” he said, adding that an ambulance crew had been dispatched to the site to treat the victims.\nRussia’s defence ministry issued a series of statements this morning claiming that its air defence forces had downed several Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region.\nSitting close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has come under frequent artillery, rocket and drone attack throughout the two-year conflict.\n01:33 PM GMT Ukraine war decimates Black Sea dolphin populations While the war in Ukraine has let to untold human suffering, it has also had a devastating impact on animal populations.\nAround 50,000 dolphins died in the Black Sea in 2022 owing to the impact of the war, the Economist reported.\nIvan Rusev, scientific director of the Tuzly Lagoons National Nature Park in Bessarabia, told the magazine he is “99 per cent certain” this mass slaughter has been caused by Russian naval sonar, which blinds the notoriously intelligent mammals, as well as explosions and birds from white phosphorous bombs.\nLuckily, since Russia’s Black Sea fleet was driven back last year, the number of dead dolphins washing up on Ukraine’s beaches has fallen “drastically”.\nIn other more optimistic news for animal lovers, fox populations have boomed in Ukraine due to a hunting ban, causing the native population to leap from an estimated 200,000 two years ago to more than 500,000 now, Viktor Chervonyi, the president of Ukraine’s hunting association, said.\nUnfortunately, their blossoming numbers have also coincided with a surge in rabies cases, with the number of people seeking post-bite rabies inoculations in the first nine month of last year rising by 40 per cent.\nElsewhere, Ukraine’s much smaller wolf and racoon-dog populations are also soaring.\n12:41 PM GMT Terror attack likely in Moscow today, UK and US warn The UK and US embassies in Russia have warned that a terrorist attack could take place in Moscow within the next 24 hours.\nThe security alert, issued by the US embassy and repeated by the UK, urged American citizens to “avoid large gatherings over the next 48 hours”.\nThe embassy said it is “monitoring reports that extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts,” but it did not specify what kind of threats it referred to, or who might be behind them.\nRussia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on March 7 that its agents had thwarted a potential Islamic State terrorist attack on a Moscow synagogue, with state-owned media reporting the militants behind the plot were killed. It is not known if the incidents are related.\nThe embassy also advised its citizens to “monitor local media for updates” and “be aware of your surroundings”.\n12:22 PM GMT ‘Stop discussing boots on the ground in Ukraine’, says Germany Germany has called for end to the debate about sending European ground troops to Ukraine amid a breakdown in relations with France.\n“Nobody really wants boots on the ground in Ukraine, there is a discussion about it now, so we should stop it at this point,” said the Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister during a visit to Helsinki.\nAntti Hakkanen, his Finnish counterpart, was similarly critical. “No one supports the ‘boots on the ground’ idea now,” he said. “But everyone supports greater support in the form of weapons, ammunition and money, and that is what we should focus on now concentrate.”\nMr Pistorius’s comments reflect a growing Franco-German rift over the European powers’ policy towards Ukraine.\nEmanuel Macron, the French president, has grown increasingly hawkish in recent weeks, yesterday calling for troops to be sent to Ukraine should Russia advance towards Kyiv or Odessa, French media reported.\nMeanwhile, Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, has faced criticism for his reluctance to supply Ukraine with long range missiles, yet data shows Germany has pledged 0.6 per cent of its GDP to supporting Kyiv, dwarfing France’s 0.1 per cent figure.\n11:43 AM GMT Pictured: Ukrainians ready their military equipment Military training for teenagers at a school in Lviv in which they learn first aid, piloting drones and shooting with military weapons -

Ukrainian Presidential Press Office Canada has pledged to join a UK and Latvia-led coalition to provide drones to Ukraine.\nThe announcement comes as Grant Shapps, the UK defence secretary, yesterday pledged to purchase an additional 10,000 “cutting edge” drones for Kyiv.\nThe new package, worth £325 million, further boosts the £200 million drone package unveiled during Rishi Sunak’s visit to Kyiv in January.\nIt mainly contains first-person view (FPV) drones, as well as surveillance and maritime drones and 1,000 one-way attack drone developed in the UK\nMr Shapps said that more than £100 million from the assistance will be spent on Ukraine’s maritime capabilities to help Kyiv “continue to turn the tide in the Black Sea”.\n10:28 AM GMT Allies fundraise to buy 800,000 shells for Ukraine European allies have banded together to purchase 800,000 artillery shells for Ukraine amid acute shortages as the US continues to withhold aid.\nPetr Pavel, the Czech President, said that a £119m boost from Norway had helped the initiative reach its target figure, Czech media reported.\nNorway was the last member of the coalition to get on board, with the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Latvia, and Canada also contributing.\nPrague launched its military aid initiative in February, locating 500,000 155mm shells and 300,000 122mm shells outside Europe that could be sent to Ukraine when the funds were raised.\n“Now everything will depend on our companies’ and the defense ministry’s abilities to speed up the whole process” Mr Pavel said.\n10:02 AM GMT India busts trafficking ring duping citizens into fighting for Russia, says Delhi India has busted a “major human trafficking network” which lured young men to Russia with the promise of jobs only to force them into military service to fight in Ukraine, its crime agency reported.\nAround 35 people have been sent to Russia in the scheme so far, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, almost double the 20-person figure that the Indian foreign ministry previously mentioned.\nAt least two men who went to Russia expecting to work as “helpers” in the army have died while fighting at the front, their families have said. The Indian Embassy in Russia confirmed one of those deaths.\nThe traffickers, operating across several Indian states, targeted people using social media platforms and through local agents, the CBI said in a statement.\nHemil Mangukiya, middle, died in a missile strike in Ukraine after emigrating from Gujurat, India, to Russia last December - REUTERS “The trafficked Indian nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,” the statement said, adding that some of the victims were also “grievously injured” in the war zone.\nThe CBI said it was conducting searches at several locations, including in the capital New Delhi and financial capital Mumbai, and 50 million rupees (£470,000) had already been seized along with documents and electronic records.\n“Certain suspects have also been detained for questioning at various locations,” it said.\nThe foreign ministry has said that every case of Indians being duped into fighting in the war had been “strongly taken up” with Moscow.\nThe Russian foreign ministry has not responded to requests for comment on the issue.\n09:30 AM GMT Ukraine orders mandatory evacuation of Kupiansk Ukraine has announced the mandatory evacuation of Kupiansk amid intensified Russian bombardment.\nAll residents, including over 1,000 children, are to be forced to leave 57 settlements in the region owing to the danger from constant shelling, Oleh Syniehubov, Kharkiv’s regional governor, stated on Telegram.\nMeanwhile, all children, along with their parents, will be evacuated from 18 villages in the Velykoburlutska and Vilkhuvatska communities, where around 160 minors currently live.\nMr Syniehubov said that these residents will be relocated within Kharkiv and other regions of Ukraine, where accommodation is already prepared for them.\n“We must protect families with children from Russian terror of civilians in the Kharkiv region,” he said. “Every day they risk their lives, because the Russians use the entire arsenal of weapons: artillery, UAVs, mortars, and aircraft.”\nMore than 28,000 people have evacuated from Kharkiv since the beginning of this year, Ukrainska Pravda reported.\nKupiansk is a crucial strategic city in Kharkiv that has come under heavy attacks in recent months as Russia intensified assault on Ukraine’s eastern front.\nElsewhere, 28 children are to be evacuated from Donetsk, the ministry of reintegration reported.\n09:14 AM GMT French defence companies to build military equipment on Ukrainian soil France is planning to have some of its arms manufacturers start producing much-needed military equipment directly on Ukrainian soil this summer, Sebastien Lecornu, the defence minister has said.\n“Three French companies will be setting up partnerships with Ukrainian companies, in particular in the drone and land equipment sectors, to produce spare parts on Ukrainian soil, and perhaps ammunition in the future”, Mr Lecornu said. “The idea is to have the first production units running this summer.”\nHe hinted the companies involved would include tank manufacturer KNDS, the holding structure formed by France’s Nexter and Germany’s Krauss-Maffei-Wegmann.\nHis comments come after the French President, Emmanuel Macron, said yesterday that French troops could be sent to Ukraine should Russia advance towards Kyiv or Odesa, the French newspaper l’Indépendent reported.\n08:47 AM GMT Two dead and dozens injured as Russia launches aerial bombardment A wave of Russian missile and drone attacks in the past 24 hours have left two people dead and dozens injured.\nA man and a woman were killed in in Kupiansk, after the city came under fire from multiple rocket strikes, Oleh Syniehubov, the Kharkiv Governor, reported.\nEarly this morning, at least seven people were injured, including a three-year-old girl, in S-300 missile strikes on Chuchiv, 50 miles to the west.
