  "title": "Manipur: Abducted Indian Army JCO rescued safely by security forces",
  "text": "A Junior Commissioned Officer (JCO) of the Indian Army, who was abducted from his home in Manipur's Thoubal district earlier in the day, has been rescued by security forces.\nThe JCO, identified as Konsam Kheda Singh, was on leave when some people barged into his home in Charangpat Mamang Leikai village at around 9 am and took him in a vehicle.\nSecurity forces launched a coordinated joint search operation to rescue Singh.\n\"The synergized efforts of the security forces resulted in the JCO being safely rescued at 6:30 PM on March 8, 2024,\" the Army said. \"The JCO is currently at Waikhong Police Station (near Kakching) in Thoubal district. Manipur Police is investigating the incident.\"\nEarlier in the day, officials said that while the cause of the abduction is not known, initial reports suggest that the case appears to be of extortion as Singh's family had received such threats in the past.\nThis was the fourth such incident since the commencement of the conflict in Manipur wherein soldiers while on leave, on duty or their relatives have been targeted.\nIn September, a former Assam Regiment soldier Serto Thangthang Kom was kidnapped and killed by an unidentified armed group from the valley. He was posted in Manipur's Leimakhong with the Defence Service Corps (DSC).\nIn November, four family members of a serving soldier were abducted and later killed in Imphal West district. They were identified as family members of Henthing Haokip, an Indian Army soldier serving in Jammu and Kashmir.\nIn February, an Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) from Manipur Police was attacked in his house in Imphal city and subsequently abducted. While the police did not name the group behind the abduction but people aware of the matters said radical Meitei outfit Arambai Tenggol may have been involved.\nEthnic violence in Manipur has since May last year left over 200 people dead and nearly 50,000 people displaced. Officials say the ethnic violence has degenerated into anarchy with underground militant groups regaining support.\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",
