  "text": "Best Bruen Mk9 loadout for Warzone Season 2 ReloadedActivision\nThe Bruen Mk9 LMG is a force to be reckoned with after it received significant buffs with the Season 2 Reloaded update. Here’s the best Bruen Mk9 loadout in Warzone, including the attachments, Perks, and Equipment needed for the top build.\nThe\nWarzone Season 2 Reloaded update has arrived, bringing major buffs to the forgotten Bruen Mk9 LMG.\nThe powerful Bruen Mk9 LMG had its ADS speed, movement speed, and torso damage multiplier buffed with the Reloaded update. As it stands, the Bruen Mk9 is poised to fly up the\nLMG ranks and could just become one of the best weapons in Warzone.\nHere’s the best Bruen Mk9 loadout to help you dominate Warzone Season 2 Reloaded.\n[Best Warzone Bruen Mk9 loadout attachments](/call-of-duty-warzone/best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-80022/#best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-attachments) [Best Warzone Bruen Mk9 loadout Perks & Equipment](/call-of-duty-warzone/best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-80022/#best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-perks-equipment) [How to unlock Bruen Mk9 in Warzone](/call-of-duty-warzone/best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-80022/#how-to-unlock-bruen-mk9-in-warzone) [Best Bruen Mk9 alternatives in Warzone](/call-of-duty-warzone/best-warzone-bruen-mk9-loadout-80022/#Best-Bruen-Mk9-alternatives-in-Warzone)\nBest Warzone Bruen Mk9 loadout attachments\n- Muzzle: VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor\n- Barrel: 23″ XRK Horizon V2\n- Underbarrel: Bruen Heavy Support Grip\n- Optic: Corio Eagleseye 2.5x\n- Magazine: 60 Round Mag\nWe begin our best Bruen Mk9 loadout in\nWarzone with the 23″ XRK Horizon V2 Barrel, buffing the LMG’s bullet velocity to make it a monster at long range while keeping some of its recoil in check.\nNext, we’ve doubled down on recoil control with the Bruen Heavy Support Grip and VT-7 Spiritfire Suppressor, making it much more manageable over larger distances.\nThe Bruen Mk9’s iron sights aren’t for everybody, so we’ve gone for the simple and clean Corio Eagleseye 2.5x, but this could easily be swapped for your preferred Optic. Finally, the 60 Round Mag offers enough ammunition to tackle multiple enemies in quick succession.\nBest Warzone Bruen Mk9 loadout Perks & Equipment\n- Perk 1: Double Time\n- Perk 2: Sleight of Hand\n- Perk 3: Quick Fix\n- Perk 4: Ghost\n- Lethal: Semtex\n- Tactical: Smoke Grenade\nTo complete the best Bruen Mk9 loadout in Warzone, it’s vital to run the ideal Perks. We recommend starting with Double Time to increase your Tactical Sprint duration to make up for the LMG’s heavy nature and Sleight of Hand to speed up reloads.\nThe Bruen promotes an aggressive playstyle, so Quick Fix will offer a nice health boost anytime you down an enemy or apply a plate. Then, Ghost will keep you hidden from UAVs so you can sneak up on players undetected.\nWhen it comes to Equipment, the Semtex is perfect for racking up a quick kill, while Smoke Grenades provide instant cover for a quick escape.\nHow to unlock Bruen Mk9 in Warzone\nWarzone players can unlock the Bruen Mk9 by hitting Level 31. This can be done by playing battle royale or Resurgence matches within the game, as well as MW3 multiplayer.\nWhile this shouldn’t take too long for those who play regularly, anyone looking to speed up the process can look out for\nDouble XP events to fly through the ranks.\nBest Bruen Mk9 alternatives in Warzone\nIf you prefer a long-range weapon in Warzone, the\nMCW and Holger 556 Assault Rifles also received significant buffs in Season 2 Reloaded. They could also fly up the ranks alongside the Bruen Mk9 in Warzone.\nFor more on Warzone, be sure to check out our other guides:\nBest Warzone controller settings | Best Warzone PC settings | How to ping enemies in Warzone | How to use Proximity Chat in Warzone | How to get a nuke in Warzone | Does Warzone have crossplay? | Best Assault Rifles in Warzone | Best SMGs in Warzone | Best FOV settings for Warzone | Best audio settings for Warzone",
