  "text": "TORONTO, Canada\nThe UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted a draft resolution Friday that demands an immediate cease-fire in Sudan during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\nThe resolution, presented by the UK, was voted on during a UNSC session and was approved with 14 votes of the 15-member Council and one abstention.\n\"We have no illusions as to the true intentions of Western countries,\" said Russia's Deputy Permanent Representative for Political Affairs, Anna Evstigneeva.\nEvstigneeva accused members of a \"double standard\" regarding Gaza, \"where a massacre is taking place, where over five months more than 30,000 people have died.\"\nShe noted that it is time for diplomacy in Sudan.\nResolution of cease-fire in Sudan\nThe resolution demands an urgent cessation of hostilities throughout Ramadan in Sudan, and encouraged efforts toward a resolution through dialogue.\nIt further demands full humanitarian aid access and urges parties to fulfill their obligations under international humanitarian law.\nSudan has been mired by fighting between the army, led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who is the head of the ruling Sovereign Council, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.\nAt least 12,260 people have been killed and more than 33,000 injured in the conflict that started last April, according to UN figures.\nA humanitarian crisis continues to worsen as nearly 6.8 million people have fled their homes seeking safety in Sudan and neighboring countries.\nSeveral cease-fire agreements brokered by Saudi Arabia and US mediators have failed to end the violence.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
