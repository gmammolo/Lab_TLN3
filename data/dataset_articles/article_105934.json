  "text": "President Biden and first lady deliver remarks at a campaign event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Firefighters battling the deadly wildfire outbreak for 12th straight day have made major progress. The smokehouse Creek fire, the latest in state history, is 87% contained. The Windy Deuce is 92% contained and the Grape Vine Creek Fire is at 96% contained, The Southern Area Blue Team is transitioning management of the three fires back over to the Texas A&M Forest Service, the National Park Service, and county judges. Blue Team Operations Section Chief Mike Brod said there has been minimal fire activity for the past three shifts. Moisture on Friday is helping firefighting efforts. The cooler weather will further reduce fire behavior on any residual pockets of heat. Dozers, engines and aerial resources are available to assist as required. As resources are no longer needed, they will be reassigned or released home.
