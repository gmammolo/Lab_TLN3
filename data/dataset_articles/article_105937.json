  "text": "The standard is the standard. That standard in 4A high school girls' basketball is Bradley Central.\nThis Bearettes team now has a chance to do what only one other team in their storied history has done, win back-to-back state championships.\nTheir opponent in Coffee County on Friday was no pushover. The Lady Raiders quickly got Miss Basketball finalist Kimora Fields in foul trouble, sending her to the bench in the game's first two minutes.\nBradley Central then relied on its endless amount of stars as Tatianna Stovall, Avary Brewer, and Harmonie Ware took over the game in the second quarter leading to a 30-17 Bearettes halftime lead.\nIn the third, their defense shined, and Fields returned to work. The defending state champions were able to extend their lead to 14 after three. From there, it was all she wrote.\nBradley Central would cruise to a 55-35 victory on stellar defense and a total team effort. Four Bearettes finished in double figures as Ware led the way with 18.\nIn the earlier semifinal game, Cleveland was looking to make some program history and qualify for their first-ever state championship game.\nThe Lady Blue Raiders had their hands full with a Bartlett team out for their own redemption after finishing runner-up to Bradley Central a season ago.\nThe Lady Panthers controlled most of the first half as they led by 10 at the break. Cleveland made their push in the third. Junior Emma Smith stepped up big for the Lady Raiders with a pair of threes on the day and big buckets in the second half.\nAn early fourth quarter Smith layup cut the Bartlett lead to two. Momentum was seemingly on the Lady Raiders side, until Carrington Jones had other plans.\nThe Bartlett star took over on her way to a game-high 23 points as the Lady Panthers were able to pull away for the 65-55 win.\nCleveland ends their season at 24-10 but put their program back on the map. The Lady Raiders made it to the state tournament for the first time since 2008 and also won a game for the first time in 16 years. The squad is only losing two seniors and has quite the future with Bianca Hensley at the helm.\nThe rematch is now set for the 4A state championship game. It will be Bradley Central and Bartlett. The Bearettes are looking to win back-to-back titles for the first time since 1975-76. It would also be their third championship in six years and eighth all-time.\nTip is set for 2 p.m. (ET) on Saturday inside the Murphy Center.",
