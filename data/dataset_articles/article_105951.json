  "text": "Estonia plans to sign a bilateral agreement on security guarantees under the Group of Seven (G7) Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on March 8 during a joint press conference in Vilnius. Foreign ministers of Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and France met on March 8 to discuss further help to Ukraine amid the ongoing Russia’s full-scale invasion. \"We are going to sign a bilateral agreement between Estonia and Ukraine for a long-term commitment as well. Estonia has poured 1.4% of its GDP into Ukraine to support its victory, and we will continue,\" Tsahkna [said](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZfBqtN6x6yo?si=7M_1fc6JW7ezUorL). [Estonia](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-says-it-stopped-hybrid-operation-by-russian-security-services/) has been one of the leading military donors to Ukraine in terms of share of GDP since the beginning of the all-out war in 2022. [Tallinn](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-pledges-1-3-billion-for-ukraine-until-2027/) pledged in January to allocate 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for Kyiv until the year 2027, a major commitment from a country of 1.3 million people. Tsahkna also announced that the Estonian government will approve a new military aid package for Ukraine next week. \"When we are signing a bilateral agreement between Estonia and Ukraine, we are promising and taking a commitment of 0.25% of (Estonian) GDP military support per year,\" the Estonian foreign minister added. Tsahkna also urged other allies to contribute, saying that 120 billion euros ($131.2 billion) of military support per year \"would be enough for Ukraine to push back Russia.\" The Group of Seven (G7) members [agreed](https://kyivindependent.com/g7-reveals-plans-to-deter-future-russian-aggression-against-ukraine/) on a joint declaration on \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine on July 12, 2023, at the NATO summit in Vilnius, aiming to entail explicit and long-lasting obligations to bolster Ukraine's ability to resist Russian aggression. Tallinn earlier delivered [Javelin anti-tank missiles](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-delivers-javelin-anti-tank-missiles-other-military-aid-to-ukraine/), [ammunition](https://kyivindependent.com/investigation-estonian-arms-dealer-sold-target-markers-to-ukraine-for-inflated-price/), and other military aid to Ukraine as part of an 80 million euros ($86 million) [military aid package](https://kyivindependent.com/estonia-to-send-88-million-in-military-aid-to-ukraine/) approved in December.",
