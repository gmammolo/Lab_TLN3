  "text": "Vagneur: A good friend fought like a Finn\nWord still travels fast in this little burg, no matter how big your plane is, and I can’t tell you how many people have posed the question: “Have you heard about Erik?” If you haven’t heard about Erik, Aspen ski legend and Powder 8 skiing champion (with intrepid partner Flint Smith) by now, you’ve likely been in a cave.\nMy good friend, Erik Peltonen, died a week ago this past Wednesday, following complications from a motorcycle accident in October. Most every day, I walk by his ski locker where we’d sometimes sit on the bench and have a short visit, usually about what we’d skied that day. A deep sense of loneliness would hit me this winter as I passed, knowing he was struggling to recover from serious injuries and hoping he would soon be back on his feet.\nIn one of our first conversations as fellow patrollers, getting to know each other, he said, “I’m Finnish. My given name is Erkki, although it’s Erik here in the U.S.” For ever after, in greeting, shaking that firm, muscular hand of his, I’d always call him Erkki.\nIt takes a while to put a good man down, especially a Finn, and as Erik wrote in a letter to the editor back in 2012: “The Finns have something they call sisu. It is a compound of bravado and bravery, of ferocity and tenacity, of the ability to keep fighting after most people would have quit, and to fight with the will to win. The Finns translate sisu as ‘the Finnish spirit,’ but it is a much more gutful word than that.” You fought like a Finn, Erkki – rest in peace.\nNew to the Aspen Mountain ski patrol back in the ’70s, Erik, a man I barely knew, took me under his wing to make sure I learned the mountain as well as anyone could from the patrol perspective, even though I knew quite a bit already. He got us special permission to do whatever we needed, and we skied through every heavy, soggy, early December snowstorm (And there were a few that year) with a smile, backs wet as much from ducking under branches heavy with the stuff as from the individual flakes falling from the sky. I’ll never forget him asking one particularly rough day, “You want to keep going?” in that deep voice of his, and the big laugh my answer in the affirmative brought forth.\nAfter I quit the normal workaday world back when and started skiing every day, he and I would sometimes make plans to meet up, especially on powder days. There were new areas that had been thinned, just barely, since I’d left the patrol, and he knew it all like the back of his hand. He truly enjoyed skiing the unusual, seldom found cuts and openings here and there that few others seemed to find or like.\nBack then, Erik tossed out the invitation to ski Highland Bowl, and it wasn’t long before he guided my first trip up there, something we continued on a regular basis. We’d hit the Bowl 2 or 3 times a week and, afterward, head for Aspen Mountain, lunch at Bonnie’s, and finish the day off there.\nA couple years later, our good friend Bob Snyder came along with us, and Erik loved taking us down the most brutal stuff he could find – legally, anyway. He knew Highlands at least as well as he knew Aspen Mountain, but then, he’d served on the Highlands ski patrol before he came over to the Big Mountain. He had his retirement party from the city on Highland Bowl, an event you didn’t want to miss for anything.\nHe caught me in the trees alongside Blondie’s one day and said, “Hey, you want to go ski some brush.” Down to earth about anything on the mountain, he meant Bonnie Bell, a favorite when we were on the patrol, not open very often. We skied it twice that day, and it’s still “brush” skiing to me. There were places he had names for, like Hidden Treasure, Smuggler’s Slip, Devil’s Cauldron, Sun Spot, #3 Cliff, things like that. He wasn’t the fastest, but he was incredibly stable, his form 100%, and he hardly ever stopped.\nHe wasn’t one to deal with “How’s Walsh’s?” or “Been down the Queen lately?” You might say, in a literary way, that he didn’t suffer fools.\n“You can’t believe what you hear”, and his main philosophy about how anything skied was, “If you don’t go, you won’t know.”\nYou can’t trust what people say; find out for yourself. That became my philosophy, as well.\nErik, you were a helluva skier, but more than that, you were a hell of a good friend. You’re gonna be missed.\nTony Vagneur writes here on Saturday and welcomes your comments at .\nTony Vagneur writes here on Saturdays and welcomes your comments at ajv@sopris.net.\nSee more",
