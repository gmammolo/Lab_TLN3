  "text": "Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski expressed approval of the initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron to send troops of Western countries to Ukraine. This was reported by the newspaper Rzeczpospolita with reference to the speech of the head of the Polish Foreign Ministry at a conference held on March 8 at the University of Warsaw on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Poland’s accession to the North Atlantic Alliance.\n“The presence of NATO forces in Ukraine is not something unimaginable,” the publication quotes the diplomat as saying.\nSikorsky explained that he “highly appreciates the president’s initiative [Франции] Emmanuel Macron” to send an armed contingent of Western countries to Ukraine due to the fact that its goal is to intimidate Moscow. A day earlier, the head of the Polish Ministry of Defense Vladislav Kosinyak-Kamysh stated that Warsaw does not intend to send its troops to Ukraine.\nOn February 26, Macron said that at a meeting in Paris, where representatives of about 20 Western countries discussed further support for Kyiv in the conflict with the Russian Federation, the topic of the possible dispatch of ground forces of Western countries to Ukraine was raised. According to the French leader, the participants were unable to reach consensus on this issue, but such a scenario cannot be ruled out in the future.\nAfter the conference, representatives of most of the countries participating in the meeting stated that they did not plan to send troops to Ukraine and, even more so, opposed their participation in hostilities against Russia. Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France Stefan Sežurne On February 27, he clarified that the presence of Western military personnel on Ukrainian territory may be required to provide certain types of assistance, including in demining territories and training Ukrainian units, but this does not imply their participation in the conflict.\n2024-03-09 01:15:00\n#Polish #Foreign #Minister #Ukraine #NATO #troops #EADaily",
