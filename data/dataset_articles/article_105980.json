  "text": "2024-03-09 05:26:45\nA clear message of support for Ukraine was sent by Kyriakos Mitsotakis from the floor of the European People’s Party conference in Bucharest, one day after the Russian attack in Odessa, close to where the prime minister and the Greek delegation were before the meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky.\n“No one will intimidate us,” explained Mr. Mitsotakis. “I think we all have a message for the Kremlin: we will not be afraid, we will continue to support Ukraine and its brave citizens for as long as it takes. And we remain united on this issue,” he said.\n“We showed our support to Ukraine in a way that was surprising to some of our enemies,” the prime minister continued. He also noted that Europe has never given such an answer, with the sanctions on Russia and with the support of Ukraine, militarily and financially.\n“No violation of international law and attempt to change borders by force will not be accepted by our political family,” he added, in a message indirectly addressed to Ankara.\n“We must ensure that nothing will be done in Europe without the active participation of the EPP, which is why it is important that our party be the dominant force in Europe,” Mr. Mitsotakis said.\n“We should be very proud of what we have achieved in the last five years. It was not a given, we fought a lot,” he also underlined and personally congratulated Ursula von der Leyen for her contribution, as he said, in extremely difficult times.\nMr. Mitsotakis referred to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, which, as he noted, posed risks to the stability of the economy.\nSpeaking about the Recovery Fund, he pointed out that these funds are used in the best way, for digital transformation, green transition and social cohesion.\nThe Prime Minister also said that Greece was the positive surprise of the Eurozone, with high growth rates without disrupting fiscal balances, noting that “we could not have achieved this without significant European support.”\nWith information from APE-MPE",
