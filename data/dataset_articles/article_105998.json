  "text": "India grabbed a handy first innings lead of 259 and then reduced England to 103-5 to stay on course for a comprehensive victory in the fifth and final test on Saturday.\nOff-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin wrecked England's top order with a three-wicket burst on day three of the contest and the tourists were staring at their fourth defeat in the series.\nEngland captain Ben Stokes fell on the stroke of lunch with the tourists still 156 runs behind.\nJoe Root was batting on 34 but England's lower order will have to bat out of their skin to deny India an innings victory at the picturesque Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium.\nEarlier resuming on 473-8, India could add only four runs before losing their last two wickets.\nEngland warhorse James Anderson became the first fast bowler to claim 700 Test wickets when he dismissed Kuldeep Yadav (30) caught behind.\nThe travelling \"Barmy Army\" fans gave Anderson a standing ovation but their morale sagged soon after England walked out to bat, having conceded a significant first-innings lead of 259.\nIndia harnessed Ravichandran Ashwin with Jasprit Bumrah for new ball duties, and the off-spinner bowled Ben Duckett (two) in his first over.\nThe opener had charged so far down the track that he would have been stumped even if he was not bowled.\nAshwin struck again in this third over, dismissing Zak Crawley for a duck.\nCrawley, England's leading scorer in the series, could only turn the ball to Sarfaraz Khan at backward short leg.\nOllie Pope made a breezy 19 before attempting a sweep against Ashwin, and Yashasvi Jaiswal took a running catch to dismiss the England vice captain.\nJonny Bairstow smacked Ashwin for three sixes in an enthralling duet between two fierce competitors both playing their 100th Test.\nKuldeep Yadav, replacing Ashwin in the attack, ended Bairstow's entertaining knock of 39, trapping him lbw.\nAshwin returned to disturb Stokes' stumps with the final delivery before the lunch break.",
