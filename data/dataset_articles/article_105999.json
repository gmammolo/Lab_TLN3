  "text": "On Oscar eve, Oppenheimer stars and physicist's descendants call for nuclear disarmament Hollywood stars, including Julianne Moore, Jane Fonda and Emma Thompson, as well as the grandson of the \"father of the atomic bomb\" Robert Oppenheimer, called on world leaders to disarm The Guardian [writes](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/06/hollywood-nuclear-disarmament-letter-oppenheimer) about it. As Christopher Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer, about the physicist who created the atomic bomb, has the most nominations for the Oscars, which will be awarded on March 10, a coalition of actors and activists signed an open letter telling people about the current nuclear danger around the world. In the letter, the signatories remind that nine countries keep 13,000 nuclear weapons, which are about 80 times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. \"As artists and advocates, we want to raise our voices to remind people that while Oppenheimer is history, nuclear weapons are not,” the letter reads. “At a time of great uncertainty, even one nuclear weapon – on land, under the sea, in the air, or in space – is too many. To protect our families, our communities, and our world, we must demand that global leaders work to make nuclear weapons history – and build a brighter future,\" the letter reads. Robert Oppenheimer’s grandson Charles has also added his name to the letter along with some stars from the film, including Tony Goldwyn and Matthew Modine. Other names include Michael Douglas, Ellen Burstyn, Alan Cumming, Bill Nye, Christoph Waltz, Lily Tomlin, Viggo Mortensen and Annie Lennox. It’s part of a new campaign called Makes Nukes History, launched by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which also includes a billboard campaign and art installation. For reference. Oppenheimer is a biographical film by Christopher Nolan about the American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who is called the \"father of the atomic bomb\" because he was the scientific director of the Manhattan Project, a World War II initiative that developed the first nuclear weapons. The film, co-produced by the United Kingdom and the United States, is based on the book American Prometheus, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. The film premiered in Ukraine on July 20. Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing biopic of all time, grossing a record $912.7 million during its release. Oppenheimer won the Critics Choice Awards 2024. The film also won the top prize at the 30th SAG Awards. The film has received 13 nominations for the Oscars 2024, including in the main category \"Best Picture\".
