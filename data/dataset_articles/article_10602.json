  "text": "Rite Aid is set to close 100 more stores in several US states after the struggling drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time. The latest closures were listed in court documents last week. It includes stores across California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Hampshire, Virginia, Washington, Delaware and Ohio. It's unclear when the stores will shut their doors, but Rite Aid has indicated that all locations will eventually close or be sold to a new owner. The company runs more than 1,200 stores in 15 US states. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy protection for a second time in May, with its CEO Matt Schroeder citing \"financial challenges intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes.\" \"We are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,\" Schroeder said in May. \"As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.\" Rite Aid said it was using the Chapter 11 process to \"pursue a sale of its prescriptions, pharmacy and front-end inventory, and other assets.\" Customers can continue to shop online and in stores in the meantime, including accessing prescriptions and immunizations. Rite Aid said it was working to transfer customer prescriptions to other pharmacies. The company secured nearly $2 billion from lenders to help fund it through bankruptcy. Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, and emerged from Chapter 11 nearly a year later as a private company. Like many other drugstore chains, Rite Aid has faced several challenges including theft, court settlements over opioid prescriptions and the rise of online shopping.",
