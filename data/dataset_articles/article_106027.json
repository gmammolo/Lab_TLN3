  "text": "\"We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate\"\nPresidency Of The Republic Of Turkey\n08.03.2024\nHolding a joint press conference with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, President ErdoÄan said: \"Since the beginning, we have made, and continue to make every contribution in our power for the termination of the war on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate.\"\nPresident Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine held a joint press conference following their meeting in Istanbul.\nExpressing his pleasure to be welcoming President Zelenskyy and his delegation to Istanbul, President ErdoÄan extended his 'get well soon' wishes to Ukraine and Greece over the missile attack that took place close to a site President Zelenskyy and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece were visiting on Wednesday, and stated: \"I offer my condolences for the Ukrainian citizens who lost their lives in the war, which has finished its second year. During today's talks with my treasured friend, we have discussed in detail the developments regarding the war. I expressed to him our findings with all sincerity as a friend.\"\n\"WE CONTINUE TO MAKE EVERY CONTRIBUTION IN OUR POWER FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE WAR\"\nRe-emphasizing TÃ¼rkiye's support for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, Ankara's strategic partner, President ErdoÄan said: \"Unfortunately, the negative repercussions of the war have been increasing on a regional and global scale, particularly in Ukraine. No diplomatic step has been taken of a quality that could come close to the negotiating table we formed for the establishment of peace in Istanbul in March 2022. Since the beginning, we have made, and continue to make every contribution in our power for the termination of the war on the basis of negotiations. We are ready to host a peace summit in which Russia will also participate. During our consultations, we have also exchanged views on issues related to the stability of the Black Sea, such as export corridors and navigational safety. As you remember, the Black Sea Initiative had prevented a global food crisis by enabling nearly 33 million tons of grains to be transported to those in need. That agreement was also inked in this hall. If an intention is expressed for a new agreement between the parties, we stand ready to lend all the support in our power again as we have done previously.\"\n\"WE ARE PLEASED BY THE STABLE COURSE OF OUR BILATERAL TRADE\"\nDrawing attention to the importance TÃ¼rkiye attaches to Ukraine standing on its own feet economically and achieving lasting security, President ErdoÄan stated: \"In this context, our support for Ukraine's goal of integration with Euro-Atlantic organizations is permanent. During today's talks, we have also thoroughly reviewed the issues concerning our bilateral relations. We are pleased by the stable course our bilateral trade follows despite the war. We have agreed to increase our efforts to reach the $10bn target. The Free Trade Agreement's immediate entry into force will undoubtedly add new momentum to our relations. Many of our companies continue their operations, confronting the risks brought about by the war. We will also strongly support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts. In this context, we held the Forum on the Reconstruction of Ukraine last January in Istanbul. I have no doubts whatsoever that our companies will be preferred by the Ukrainian government in order for them to take on more responsibilities in the period ahead.\"\nTouching upon the critical role the Crimean Tatars play in the relations between TÃ¼rkiye and Ukraine, President ErdoÄan said: \"Crimean Tatars' existence in Ukraine is one of the important elements that strengthen the friendship between the two countries. Crimean Tatars, an indispensable part of Ukraine, have been endeavoring tirelessly for the restoration of the country's territorial integrity. I would like to thank Mr. Zelenskyy once again for his efforts aimed at safeguarding the rights of our kinsmen and strengthening their autonomous status. We, for our part, have always supported and will continue to support our Crimean Tatar kinsmen. While maintaining our solidarity with Ukraine in the period ahead, we will also continue our works for the termination of the war with a fair peace through negotiations. I wish that our consultations today may lead to favorable developments for the entire humanity, particularly for our respective countries.\"\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
