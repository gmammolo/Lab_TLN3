  "text": "Sweden, welcome to NATO!\nMinistry of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria\n08.03.2024\nThe Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Bulgaria extends its congratulations to the Kingdom of Sweden on the occasion of the country's joining the world's most powerful defensive alliance. Sweden has become the 32nd full member of the Alliance and will contribute to improving security in the Baltic Region, the Eastern Flank of NATO, and the entire Euro-Atlantic area.\nAs a political act, the accession of the Kingdom of Sweden to NATO sends a clear message of the importance of the Alliance in ensuring the security of Europe. In addition to that, it also opens up further opportunities for enhanced bilateral defence cooperation.\nBulgaria has consistently supported NATO's open door policy. The new members of the Alliance, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden, submitted their applications to join NATO on 18 May 2022. The protocols for the accession of the two countries to the Alliance were signed on 5 July 2022 in Brussels. On 13 July 2022, the Bulgarian National Assembly ratified the protocols for the accession of the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the North Atlantic Treaty.\n|\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list|\n|\n||\n|",
