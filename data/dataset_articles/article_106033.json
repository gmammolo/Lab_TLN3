  "text": "Hungarian PM meets with Trump and asks him to \"come back and bring peace\" Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, has held a meeting with Donald Trump, the future candidate for the US presidential elections from the Republicans, in the American state of Florida. Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hungarys-pm-orban-supports-trump-after-florida-meeting-2024-03-09/) and European Pravda Details: They discussed \"a wide range of issues affecting Hungary and the United States, including the paramount importance of strong and secure borders to protect the sovereignty of each nation,\" as Trump’s campaign statement notes. Orbán expressed his confidence that only Trump's return to the White House can bring peace [on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/PM_ViktorOrban/status/1766305639595119060)(X). \"We need leaders in the world who are respected and can bring peace. He is one of them! Come back and bring us peace, Mr. President!\" Orbán wrote. At the same time, in his Facebook video, Orbán stated that during the Trump presidency in 2017-2021 there was peace in the Middle East, as well as in Ukraine. He added that there would be no war in Ukraine now if Trump had been re-elected in 2020. Sources familiar with the matter [revealed to CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/08/politics/trump-orban-mar-a-lago/index.html) that Trump and a small group of close advisers had held talks with Orbán for about an hour Friday night at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. After that, Trump took Orbán to a tribute band concert, which was part of a closed event at the club. A CNN insider described the meeting as \"social\" with no agenda, while a separate source said it was \"friendly.\" According to another source, Orbán wanted to meet with Trump and planned to be in the US separately. Background: - Earlier, Peter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, said that Orbán wants to [discuss with Trump how to stop Russia's war](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2024/03/6/7181174/)against Ukraine. - Orbán participated in several pro-Trump events in previous years and directly [spoke out for his re-election](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-23/ukraine-can-t-win-war-against-russia-hungarian-premier-says)as president. He said, in particular, that \"if Trump had been president, the war would not have started\" and that Trump's return \"will bring peace.\" Trump responded by praising Orbán. - The media previously reported that [Trump plans to host Orbán](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-29/trump-plans-to-meet-with-hungary-s-orban-at-mar-a-lago-next-week?srnd=homepage-europe)on 8 March at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
