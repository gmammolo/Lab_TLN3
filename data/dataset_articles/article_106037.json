  "text": "On a significant day for Taiwan's maritime defense, President Tsai Ing-wen proudly presided over the launch of the '\nTaipei,' a state-of-the-art 4,000-tonne Coast Guard ship, symbolizing a major stride in Taiwan's domestic shipbuilding capabilities and its determination to safeguard freedom and democracy. This event, held in Kaohsiung on March 9, not only highlights Taiwan's commitment to enhancing its maritime patrol capacity but also its readiness to contribute more substantially to international humanitarian rescue missions.\nStrengthening Maritime Defense and Humanitarian Capabilities\nThe 'Taipei' is one of the Chiayi-class offshore patrol vessels, a series of ships ordered from Taiwan's CSBC Corporation, aimed at bolstering the nation's Coast Guard force. Together with its sister ship 'Yunlin,' which was launched in December 2022, the Taipei is equipped with advanced medical facilities, including an operating theater and negative pressure rooms, underscoring Taiwan's enhanced capabilities in conducting international humanitarian rescue operations. This launch is part of a broader NT$42.6 billion (US$1.35 billion) initiative, started in 2018, to revitalize the local shipbuilding industry and strengthen maritime patrol capacity, with plans to construct 141 Coast Guard ships by 2027.\nCountering Threats and Ensuring Safety\nThese vessels, boasting impressive maneuverability and range, are designed to escort Taiwan-registered fishing boats in contested waters, safeguard civilian ships from piracy, and potentially counteract Chinese coast guard ships if necessary. Their capabilities are comparable to the United States Coast Guard's Legend-class national security cutters, marking a significant upgrade in Taiwan's maritime defense assets. Amid increasing 'gray zone' activities by China near Taiwan-controlled waters, the addition of the Chiayi-class vessels is expected to bolster the morale of Taiwan's Coast Guard officers and enhance law enforcement efficacy in the region.\nUnity in Defense and International Support\nThe launch ceremony was attended by notable figures including Vice President Lai Ching-te, Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling, and CSBC Corp, Taiwan Chairman Cheng Wen-lon, demonstrating a united front in Taiwan's defense and maritime strategy. The event also reflects Taiwan's broader efforts to modernize its navy and enhance its maritime defense capabilities in the face of growing military pressure from Beijing, ensuring the island's ability to maintain its sovereignty and contribute to regional stability.\nThe launch of the 'Taipei' Coast Guard ship marks a pivotal moment in Taiwan's maritime defense strategy, signifying not only an advancement in military capabilities but also a firm commitment to international humanitarian efforts. As Taiwan continues to navigate the complexities of regional stability and sovereignty, the role of its Coast Guard, bolstered by the addition of the Chiayi-class vessels, will be crucial in maintaining peace and security in the face of evolving challenges.",
