  "text": "Kenya says to strengthen military to guarantee peace, stability Kenyan President William Ruto said on Saturday that his government is strengthening the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) to guarantee the country’s peace and stability. Ruto said the military, which has participated in peacekeeping missions abroad, is a model institution that has guaranteed Kenya’s peace and stability for several years. “As you provide security and stability for our nation, we will work smart and hard to make sure that we deliver on our commitments to the people of Kenya,” he said during the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed KDF vice chief and service commanders in the national capital of Nairobi. Ruto, who noted that the strength of a nation is dependent on its institutions, said his government is strengthening all public institutions to make them deliver on their mandate, including food production, job creation, and healthcare provision, among others. The president pointed out that without the country’s security and stability, “it becomes much more difficult to achieve all other aspirations”. Ruto affirmed the government’s commitment to a united Kenya devoid of tribalism and division. “It is my desire that we eliminate tribalism, ethnicity, and marginalization and consolidate our nation into a peaceful, united, and progressive nation.”",
