  "text": "Kim Jong Un, general secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea and president of the State Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, inspected a major operational training base of the Korean People’s Army in the western area on March 6 to make the rounds of training facilities and guide the actual manoeuvres of units.\nAccompanying him was Pak Jong Chon, secretary of the WPK Central Committee and vice-chairman of the WPK Central Military Commission.\nThe respected Comrade Kim Jong Un was greeted on the spot by Kang Sun Nam, minister of National Defence of the DPRK, Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff, the deputy chief of the KPA General Staff, the director of the combat training department, commanders of units for major missions and other commanding officers of the KPA.\nHe learned in detail about the facilities and training grounds in the base.\nHe appreciated the fact that all the elements have been built in a practical way so that various training can be conducted in high intensity in an actual war atmosphere, true to the important military policy-oriented tasks set forth by the Party Central Committee before the army. And he stressed the need to make positive use of them so as to practically contribute to strengthening the combat capability of the People’s Army, further consolidate the material and technical foundation and properly conduct the maintenance work for them.\nHe mounted the observation post and received a report on the program for actual maneuvers of the units planned that day before guiding the drill.\nTaking part in the drill were combat units at all levels mobilized according to the plan.\nIn the drill, the valiant combatants, who have fostered matchless strength with their unsparing sweat in regular training for strengthening the combat capability, being boundlessly loyal to their noble mission of defending the security of the country and the people, fully displayed their actual war capability in full readiness to fight and surely defeat the enemy, staking the honour of their units.\nExpressing his great satisfaction over the training of servicepersons, Kim Jong Un highly praised the strong revolutionary spirit and the indomitable fighting spirit of the combatants who are keeping their perfect battle readiness.\nSaying that he felt very glad and inspired to see the soldiers display to the full the brave stamina of a stalwart fighter in the training environment little different from actual war, he encouraged the servicepersons, who are fulfilling their duty always with battlefield in their mind, with ardent patriotism.\nStressing the need for the KPA to further intensify training at present, he set forth important tasks for intensifying practical actual-war drills to ensure victory in war.\nTo contain the constant threat of the enemies with overwhelming force, successfully control even their slightest attempt to ignite a war and correctly carry out the important mission in contingency, our army should always make more exact demands on itself in keeping with the aspects of changing and developing modern warfare and steadily intensify actual war drills aimed at rapidly improving its combat capabilities for perfect war preparedness, he said, underscoring the need for the units at all levels of the entire army to dynamically usher in a new heyday of intensifying war preparations in line with the requirements of the prevailing situation.\nThe country is secure and its people’s security is defended and their happiness is created thanks to our army, the genuine defender and servant of the people that dashes forward in the van of the era, taking charge of both national defence and socialist construction, he said, adding that our army should continue to reliably play the leading role in our great era, bearing deep in mind the trust and expectation of the Party and the people.\nThat day he had a photo session with the dependable combatants who powerfully demonstrated a-match-for-a-hundred fighting efficiency in the drill with their strong will and courage.\nCommanding officers and all the combatants of the KPA pledged their intense loyalty to Kim Jong Un, who guided their training and gave them great trust, encouragement and matchless courage and pluck, and hardened their resolve to fully discharge their honorable duty as the army of the Party and the people in the sacred struggle for the security of the country and happiness of the people.",
