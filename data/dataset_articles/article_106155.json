It was loaves and fishes territory.\nHarry McKay and Charlie Curnow celebrate at the Gabba. Credit: Getty Images\nWhere did it rate in the annals of Carlton victories? It was natural to think of the 1999 preliminary final, when the Blues beat the fancied Bombers by the same barest margin on the back of Anthony Koutoufides’ final quarter, or even of that semi-final last year when Blake Acres booted the winner with less than a minute on the clock to sink the Demons.\nUnquestionably, this was one of the better home-and-away triumphs in Carlton history. But it is also far too soon – not even round one, according to the AFL – to leap to rapid conclusions about where this result placed Carlton or the Lions, albeit Brisbane cannot afford many defeats at home.\nLoading A yip-less Harry McKay was the hero of the hour , plucking a powerful mark and slotting the set shot to put the Blues ahead; McKay had set up the previous goal to Patrick Cripps, too, and while he had some glitches, Harry was the most influential player afield.\nIf McKay closed the deal, the Blues wouldn’t have been close if not for Harry’s forward partner Charlie Curnow, whose run of four goals in the second and third quarter whittled the Lions’ large lead to seven points.\nSo, while the competition contains too many variables to coronate Carlton (or condemn the Lions), the comeback should put paid to the specious notion that there isn’t room for McKay in a Curnow-centred attack.\nThe theory that the Blues fare better with only one of Curnow or McKay – which really means with only Charlie – gained a surprising level of currency within media, fans and even from some rival club officials in 2023.\nAdvertisement Loading McKay won the Coleman Medal without Curnow in 2021, Curnow took the next two Colemans with McKay stricken with conversion aversion (aka, the yips) and a loss of confidence.\nOver the past three seasons, Curnow averages 2.7 goals when playing alongside McKay and 3.6 when Harry is missing. McKay, meanwhile, averages 1.9 goals with Curnow and 3.1 when Charlie is grounded.\nSomehow, the fact that both players kick more goals when they’re solo led to a conclusion – admittedly, a minority view – that the Blues would improve their flag prospects by selling McKay and letting Curnow hold up the forward line, potentially deploying Tom De Koning as the second tall target (and back-up ruck). Of course each player kicked more goals when the other was absent – they were the solo target.\nMcKay’s yips persisted in 2023, when he snagged a modest 29 goals from 77 shots – a dismal accuracy percentage of 37.7. At times, he seemed uncertain about whether he would use a Stevie (Johnson) J-hook from an angle or deploy the drop punt – an issue he said he had worked on over summer .\nHad McKay found his range, he’d have gone close to 50 goals, which would have produced an aggregate of 130 goals from the tandem.\nOn Friday night, the combination of Curnow and McKay was beyond the scope of the Lions’ defence. Harris Andrews played 96 minutes on McKay, which meant Jack Payne had to take on Curnow.\nHarry McKay sealed Carlton’s amazing comeback win over the Brisbane Lions. Credit: AFL Photos\nCharlie’s four goals either side of half-time resulted in the Lions sending Darcy Gardiner back (Gardiner had been playing forward) to stand the superstar, while Andrews stuck with McKay.\nAided by this double threat, the Blues booted seven goals from just 14 entries in the third quarter.\nThe against-all-odds triumph highlighted that McKay and Curnow have different styles and dimensions – the former a hulking 200-centimetre giant, the latter a super athlete with rare agility and lateral movement. Hardly any rival teams have two key defenders with the necessary traits and talents to match both at once.\nRichmond, for example, would much prefer to play the Blues next Thursday without one of McKay or Curnow; they would be asking too much of Josh Gibcus, a talented kid who hasn’t filled out, to expect him to play a key role.\nMcKay isn’t in the top five key forwards in the game, no. Curnow is probably the best. Put Harry on the block, though, and a dozen or more clubs would be in the queue.\nCurnow’s athleticism enables him to get goals in the air (he led the league in contested marks last year), on the deck and by drawing frees. Of his 81 goals in 2023, 47 came from marks.\nLoading In the Carlton set-up, he should be comparable to Geelong’s Jeremy Cameron, and McKay to the hulking Tom Hawkins (not that he’s at Hawkins’ level). One is an athlete, with a serious ground game plus excellent foot skills, while the other is a mountain who requires a near 200cm opponent. Curnow isn’t as exquisitely skilled as Geelong’s Jezza, but his aerial game is superior.\nFor the Blues, Curnow can play higher up the field if necessary, as McKay keeps a tall back such as Andrews occupied. Ideally, the tandem work best when they’re surrounded by smalls and medium-sized options, rather than with De Koning as a third banana.\nThe slights on McKay have been a familiar case of critics – and I’ve not been immune – focusing too much on his foibles and forgetting his considerable strengths.\nTo have two menacing key forwards in one forward line is a major point of difference between the Blues and at least 16 clubs, and on Friday evening, it made all the difference.\nIt is the responsibility of Carlton’s coaches, as much as the players themselves, to make the combination work. As the Gabba miracle showed, the most critical step is for McKay to come to the party.\nKeep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country. Sign up for the Real Footy newsletter .",
