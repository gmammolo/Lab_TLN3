  "text": "Mumbai hosted the glitzy 71st Miss World 2024 pageant, which saw participation from beautiful contestants from 112 countries of the world. Femina Miss India World 2022, Sini Shetty, India’s representative to the event, reached the top 8 at the 71st Miss World Festival. The Mumbai-based finance graduate, marketer, dancer and aspiring actress, Sini Shetty was a crowd favourite, and gave the gorgeous contestants a tough competition. She has consistently demonstrated her prowess throughout the beauty pageant, initiating her winning streak by securing the Best Designer Award. In a tribute to her predecessors during the Miss World Talent round, Sini recently paid a graceful homage to the former Miss World Aishwarya Rai. She showcased her dance skills with renditions of Aishwarya's iconic numbers such as \\\"Nimbooda\\\" from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, \\\"Taal Se Taal Mila\\\" from Taal, and \\\"Kajra Re\\\" from Bunty Aur Babli, among others. Sini, a trained Bharatnatyam dancer, achieved her Arangetram at the age of 14.Ahead of the event, which was held in India after a hiatus of 28 years, Sini Shetty had expressed her excitement and said representing 1.4 billion people is a huge responsibility. \\\"My representation means the world to me. I am not representing myself, I am representing 1.4 billion people and that's a huge responsibility altogether because you are representing Indian culture, the diverse traditions that we have, the feelings and the emotions of each and every individual living in this country,\\\" she said.Not one to ignore her predecessors, as part of the Miss World Talent round, Sini recently even paid a graceful tribute to ex Miss World Aishwarya Rai as she danced to Aishwarya’s iconic numbers like Nimbooda from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Taal Se Taal Mila from Taal and Kajra Re from Bunty Aur Babli among others. Sini is a trained Bharatnatyam dancer who completed her Arangetram at the age of 14.In the final Q&A round, Sini was asked, “Can you suggest a way that women can be empowered through social media?” To this question she answered “Well today, we live in a world where social media is of such power and use that conversation and awareness can create change. And I do believe that social media has the power to change the world, and Generation Z; create conversation and awareness around the fact that women empowerment can take its recourse towards progressive march and perfection. And on this stage, I take the light to be the change and be the source and use social media to its utmost utility to be the power of change.”Krystyna Pyszkova from Czech Republic won the 71st Miss World title. Lebanon's Yasmina Zytoun was announced the runner up.",
