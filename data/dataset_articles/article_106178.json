  "text": "play videoplay video Video duration 02 minutes 51 seconds 02:51 As the holy month of Ramadan approaches, the people of the Yabna neighborhood in the city of Rafah (south of the Gaza Strip) continue to remove rubble from the Al-Huda Mosque, which was bombed by Israeli occupation aircraft last February. Neighborhood residents say that they repaired what they could of the destroyed mosque through personal efforts and initiatives so that prayers and Tarawih prayers could be held there despite the war conditions. Israel has been waging a brutal war on the Gaza Strip since the seventh of last October, leaving tens of thousands of civilians martyred and wounded, most of them children and women, a humanitarian catastrophe and massive destruction of infrastructure, including dozens of hospitals and mosques, which led to Tel Aviv appearing before the International Court of Justice. Charged with genocide. As a result of the war and Israeli restrictions, the residents of the Gaza Strip are on the verge of famine, in light of a severe scarcity of food, water, medicine and fuel supplies, with the displacement of about two million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, which has been besieged by Israel for 17 years.
