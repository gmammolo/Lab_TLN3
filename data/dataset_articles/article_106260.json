  "text": "2024-03-09 21:45:00\nThe 13th Magritte du cinéma took place this Saturday evening. And a strong moment came during the evening when around ten participants in the ceremony took the stage to denounce the war between Israel and Hamas and launch an appeal for peace.\nPeople called for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip and demanded the release of Hamas hostages. “Our thoughts go to the families of the 1,200 victims of the Hamas attack on October 7, but also to the families of the 30,000 Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza. We call for the return of the hostages but we also say the impossible moral justification of human, material, and ethical massacre underway in Gaza for 5 months,” declared the participants.\nThey also had a message addressed to the Belgian government, asking it to contribute to a cease-fire, to the sending of humanitarian aid, to the cessation of arms exports to Israel and to the release of all the hostages.\nNote that some winners, as we can see in the image below, collected their prize with a badge in the colors of Palestine.\nSandrine Blancke appears with a badge in the colors of Palestine\n1710027779\n#Magrittes #strong #gesture #IsraelHamas #war\nRelated posts:\nA crowded reception for the Stray Kids band at Riyadh Airport The Messy 2023 Golden Globes Failed to Justify Its Existence – Rolling Stone \"Center Pompidou Paris to Close for Restoration Works and Asbestos Removal Until 2030: Updates and D... \"He is without oxygen and with a lot of love\": Nacho Gutiérrez and the delicate situation he is goin... \"to win!
