  "text": "Jewish voices call for an end to war LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Jewish voices in Louisville called for an end to the war in the Middle East Saturday. On Oct. 7, the militant group Hamas launched an attack that killed around 1,200 Israelis. Since then, more than 30,000 have been killed in the fighting, most of them civilians in Gaza. The group Jewish Louisvillians for Peace held a panel to talk about the Jewish perspective and call for the violence to stop. “We want to provide a space where Jews and people who are committed to remaining in relationship with Jews despite the intensity and the horror of these times are able to discuss things with each other and be in the community and share thoughts and feelings and hope for the future,” Siera Hanks of Jewish Louisvillians for Peace said. More than 100 people signed up for the panel. Some of the notable speakers were former Congressman John Yarmuth and two UofL professors, one of which is a former Israel Defense Forces officer.
