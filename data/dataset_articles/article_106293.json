(PHOTO / AFP) KHARTOUM - Sudan's warring parties have welcomed the UN Security Council's resolution issued Friday that urged an immediate halt to hostilities during Ramadan. The Sudanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement Friday expressing appreciation for the resolution but outlined four conditions for its implementation. These conditions encompassed the withdrawal of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) from civilian areas and public installations, as well as from states and cities affected since the Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect Civilians in 2023. The UN resolution, proposed by Britain, emphasizes the immediate cessation of hostilities during Ramadan and calls for a sustainable dialogue to resolve the conflict ALSO READ: [Sudan denies US allegation of obstructing humanitarian access](https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/377943) The RSF, in response, welcomed the resolution on Saturday, expressing hope that it would alleviate Sudanese suffering by facilitating humanitarian aid delivery and civilian movement.
