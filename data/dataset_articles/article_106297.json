At NDTV's maiden Defence Summit, General Pande said that non-state actors are \"increasingly gaining access\" to modern military technologies.This trend, he explained, has led to a rise in risk-taking behavior and a lower threshold for the initiation of armed conflicts.\"The fallout is an increased propensity in risk-taking behavior and low threshold for initiation of armed conflicts,\" General Pande stated, acknowledging the challenges posed by the changing dynamics in modern warfare.\"Amidst all of above, the legacy challenges of unsettled borders continue. Newer threats in the conflict spectrum have added to the complexities,\" he said.The Army chief said that \"grey zone actions and aggression by our adversaries is manifesting across multiple domains including the military i.e. on land, air and maritime space\".Consequent to all these developments, the battle space has become more \"complex, contested and lethal and shall remain so in the future\", General Pande said.He highlighted how warfare has diversified into new domains, including cyber, electromagnetic spectrum, information, and space.
