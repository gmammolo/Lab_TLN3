  "text": "Former refugee helps hundreds of Ukrainians to safety in Alaska ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Hundreds of people have sought Alaska as a safe haven after war broke out in Ukraine in 2022. Catholic Social Services Alaska Office of Refugees told lawmakers last week in Juneau that Alaska has seen a drastic change in its refugee services. “In the last two years in refugee services hitting a peak of resettlement that we have never seen before,” Issa Spatrisano, the state’s refugee coordinator for CSS, said during a meeting with lawmakers. According to Spatrisano, that spike is linked to the more than 1,000 Ukrainians who came to Alaska after the war broke out overseas. Of her department’s 917 cases, that they currently handle, 619 are a part of Ukrainian humanitarian parole. A program that allows refugees to stay in Alaska for as long as two years. Refugees and their close family can reapply after the two-year mark by filling out [forms and waivers. ](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/uniting-for-ukraine/re-parole-process-for-certain-ukrainian-citizens-and-their-immediate-family-members) Zori Opanasevych, a former Ukrainian refugee, came to the U.S. in the 1990s when she was seven years old. “I realized that I gotta do something,” Opanasevych said. “That’s how it helped me cope with the pain of doing something about it.” Opanasevych, who is now the program director for the Ukraine Relief Program, said she’s helped more than 1,000 Ukrainians come to Alaska in the last two years. During the early part of the year she said she would make three trips per week to the airport, welcoming about 50 Ukrainians to Alaska each time. Now, Opanasevych said she welcomes about 20 Ukrainians to Alaska each week. The need for help, she said, remains strong. “There’s people who said, ‘I’ll stay there, wait it out,’ but now they’re saying, ‘I can’t,’” Opanasevych said. ‘I just can’t handle the sirens anymore. I can’t live this way.’ Or, ‘I really lost everything at this point... I could make it through, but now I have to rely on someone else to help me get me out of here.’” Copyright 2024 KTUU.
