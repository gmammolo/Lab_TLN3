  "text": "Ukraine can stop Putin if US provides weapons - Biden Ukraine could stop the Russian dictator Vladimir Putin if it will be provided with the necessary weapons, states US President Joe Biden in his address to Congress. \"Since President Lincoln and the Civil War, there have been undersolved at home as there are today. Putin's Russia on the March invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you, he will not. But Ukraine, Ukraine can stop Putin. Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide them with the weapons they need to defend itself,\" Biden said. According to the president, aid is being blocked by those who want to step away from global leadership. Biden also mentioned Trump in his speech and his support for Putin. \"Now my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin quote - do whatever the hell you want. That's a quote. A former president actually said that bowing down to the Russian leader. I think it's outrageous, it's dangerous and it's unacceptable,\" Biden said. According to the President of the US, the country cannot put Ukraine, Europe, and the entire free world at risk. \"History is literally watching. History is watching. The US walks away if it puts Ukraine at risk. Europe is at risk, the Free World will be at risk, and bolding others to do what they wish, to do us harm. My message to President Putin, whom I've known for a long time, is simple - we will not walk away, we will not bow down\" said the President of the US. Biden also stated that there are no American soldiers in Ukraine, and he promised not to allow this in the future. US support for Ukraine Earlier, we reported that [the Biden administration is considering assistance to Ukraine](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/biden-weighs-use-army-funds-for-ukraine-aid-1709760629.html) from the US Army budget. The aid could amount to around $200 million. Recently, the Senate passed a separate bill with funds for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. For the bill to take effect, it still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives and signed by President Joe Biden. According to CNN, the House of Representatives [may vote on financial aid to Ukraine in late March or April.](https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/us-house-of-representatives-may-vote-on-aid-1709505609.html)",
