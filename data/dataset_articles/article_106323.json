  "text": "asiaone.com - 41 minutes ago A good man should be a soldier : Man lives overseas for 16 years but returns to Singapore to serve NS Over four-fifths of his life was spent overseas, but this man still returned to serve his nation. Li Ruizhang (transliteration) moved overseas when he was three years old but returned to Singapore for National Service (NS) 16 years later, Shin Min Daily News reported on Saturday (March 9). Speaking with Shin Min, Li explained that he had been taught that a good man should be a soldier since young and his parents had also prepared him to return home for NS when he was of age. The 20-year-old had moved to Canada as a child before staying in New Zealand for the past seven years. Recalling the previous time he had returned to Singapore, he told the Chinese publication that it was to attend his sister s wedding. His mother had used the in-flight entertainment system to play Ah Boys to Men for Li to watch, even buying an apartment in 2015 in preparation for his move back to Singapore after he enlisted. Once he did, his mother also flew back to Singapore to stay with him for half a year to help him adapt to his new environment, Li shared.\nRead on the original site",
