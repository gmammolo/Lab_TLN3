  "text": "Ukrainian officials have hit back at the Pope's comments that Kyiv should have the \"courage\" to negotiate an end to the war with Russia.Pope Francis also used the phase \"white flag\" which many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender.“I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,” said Pope Francis.The comments, made during an interview with Swiss broadcaster RSI, have angered officials in Ukraine, including Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.“Our flag is blue and yellow. We live, die and win under it. We will not raise other flags,” he posted on X, formally Twitter.Kuleba also invited Francis to Ukraine, saying the pope's visit would show support for “more than a million Ukrainian (Roman) Catholics, more than 5 million Greek Catholics, all Christians and all Ukrainians.\"Meanwhile, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski tweeted: “How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?\"Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations.”The head of Ukraine's Greek Catholic Church, Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, said that surrender is not on the minds of Ukrainians.“Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will endure,\" he said. \"Believe me, it never crosses anyone’s mind to surrender.\"Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni clarified that the pope supported “a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations,” rather than an outright Ukrainian surrender.Bruni said that the journalist interviewing Francis used the term “white flag” in the question that prompted the controversial remarks. During the interview the Pope added: \"When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate. Negotiations are never a surrender.”Kyiv remains firm on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said multiple times that the initiative in peace negotiations must come from the country that has been invaded.
