  "text": "China has called for “direct dialogue” between Russia and Ukraine, saying it is willing to play its part to “build bridges” to bring the two sides to the table to end the conflict now in its third year.\\n“China calls on the parties concerned to remain calm and restrained, strengthen direct contact and dialogue, gradually build consensus, and jointly explore feasible solutions,” Chinese envoy to the UN Geng Shuang told a United Nations Security Council meeting on the conflict on Friday.\\n“We are willing to continue to maintain communication and contact with all parties, build consensus for a ceasefire and an end to the war, pave the way and build bridges for dialogue and peace talks, make unremitting efforts and play a constructive role in promoting the political settlement of the crisis.”\\nThere were “no winners in conflicts and confrontations” and all conflicts must end around the negotiation table, Geng added.\\n“The earlier we start talking, the sooner peace will come.”\\nGeng’s statement came during a second shuttle diplomacy trip in less than a year by Beijing’s special representative for Eurasian affairs, Li Hui.\\nLi has already stopped in Moscow, Brussels, Kyiv and Warsaw in his mission to promote a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. This week, he is expected to visit Paris and Berlin, the last two stops on his itinerary.\\n\\nAs Russia gains momentum on the battlefield and Ukraine desperately looks for renewed Western support, China is stepping up efforts to build a consensus for peace.\\nThis includes working on the possibility of inviting Russia to a Ukraine peace summit hosted by Switzerland, the Post reported earlier.\\nIn his meeting with Russian deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin on March 2, Li also agreed that Russia should be included in any peace settlement for Ukraine, according to Moscow’s foreign ministry.\\nBut there is scepticism in the West about China’s peace efforts, given Beijing’s close ties with Moscow.\\nMeeting Li in Brussels on Monday, European Union officials again urged China to curb the exports of dual-use equipment to Russia that could aid the Russian military.\\nIn response to the bloc’s restrictions on four Chinese companies last month, Li voiced his “firm opposition” to the EU’s “unilateral sanctions”, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.\\nLi also reportedly urged Europe to stop sending weapons to Ukraine in order for negotiations to take place, comments described by EU officials as repeating “Moscow’s talking points”.\\nEU locks horns with China’s envoy on Ukraine, as schisms on war remain\\nBeijing insists it is neutral in the war and has blamed Western military support for Ukraine for prolonging the conflict.\\nThough divisions remain, both the EU and Ukraine have repeatedly appealed to China to use its influence on Russia.\\nLi and Ukrainian officials meeting in Kyiv on Thursday discussed the possibility for China to help end the forced deportation of Ukrainian children. Li was also shown samples of the wreckage of a downed missile made by North Korea, another Beijing partner accused of militarily supporting Russia’s invasion.\\nA brief Chinese foreign ministry statement said Li held “candid and friendly” talks with Ukrainian officials.\\n",
