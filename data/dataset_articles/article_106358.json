  "text": "Last Sunday's State Journal editorial, \" Senator ‘No’ cannot go soon enough ,\" about U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Oshkosh, claimed \"Our brave and outgunned ally desperately needs more ammunition in its heroic fight against totalitarian Russia.\" Johnson is against more war funding for Ukraine but is in favor of a settlement agreement in this war -- that is called peace. The State Journal editorial board's support of this conflict is naive. My question is: How much more support for this stalemate and carnage of young Russian and Ukrainian warriors is enough, and what will victory look like? Are we ready to support rebuilding the Badger Ammunition Plant and more F-35s at Truax Field in Madison. Are we ready to risk an escalation of this conflict that could lead to a direct conflict with Russia, a formidable nuclear armed adversary? People are also reading… Our history in foreign intervention from Vietnam to the withdrawal in Afghanistan has not gone well. Were the anti-war protests on Bascom Hill in the 1960s all for nothing. What about four shot and killed at Kent State on May 4, 1970. I would like U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, who is on the ballot in November, to explain her \"yes\" vote in support of this war funding. Phillip J.
