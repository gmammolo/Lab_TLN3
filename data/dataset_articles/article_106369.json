  "text": "Eighteenth clean sheet in the championship for the Nerazzurri, who find Acerbi at the top again and enjoy Bastoni and Bisseck\nAfter overcoming the Bologna obstacle, Inter is preparing to face Atletico Madrid in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16. A challenge that promises to be very hot, against a top-level opponent who has nothing left to lose, in a historically fiery environment. To emerge unscathed and pass the Nerazzurri’s turn, the best defense will be needed, which also sent decidedly comforting signals yesterday, as underlined La Gazzetta dello Sport : “ A few weeks ago, after yet another goal constructed by his defenders, Inzaghi was asked if the idea of ​​the most extreme challenge tickled him, a cross from a centre-back for a goal from another centre-back. Simone smiled, maybe deep down he was already caressing the thing. Here it is, March 9th, Inter’s birthday and programmatic manifesto of Nerazzurri football : left-footed shot from Bastoni and perfect insertion from Bisseck “.\nSolidity and new certainties —\n“ Eighteenth clean sheet in the championship, against the fourth strength of the tournament: Inter is ready to withstand the blow of Simeone’s team, who may have lost yesterday in Cadiz but no one among the Nerazzurri is under the illusion that it could be a walk in the park, the match on Wednesday. Because Inter steals the eye for their play, for their ability to score, of course. But they know how to occupy spaces on the pitch like no other team in Italy and they also know how to suffer and raise the block when needed, like in the second half of yesterday. This is where individual performance is also needed. Bisseck is the perfect example of a defensive mechanism that works perfectly, but also of a player who has the physique and quality to be the starter of tomorrow and much more than a reserve now “.\nTop condition —\n“ Bologna was also yet another confirmation for Bastoni and it is best to leave aside the assist, in this reasoning. The number 95 also exalted himself in a second half in which he practically never went to the other side of the pitch. Looking at Madrid, there is nothing to smile about: the physical condition is top, the level of maturity even in managing difficult moments, with the experience in knowing how to slow down the pace of the match, is now a fact. And then, Acerbi: he hadn’t played an entire match for a month and a half, the running-in is complete. And what a run-in: Zirkzee ended up in the collection of anesthetized center forwards, the shirt for Madrid is booked at this point. The centre-back is fine, very well: at a certain point he found himself as a centre-forward in offensive projection, in the advances he exalted himself, regained command of the department, as if he had never left. And finally Sommer. Because the victory belongs to him too, it also passed through his hands, security when it seems like it could rain at any moment “.\n2024-03-10 09:00:06\n#Top #condition #solidity #Inter #defense #ready #Atletico #Madrid\nRelated posts: To hell and back.
