  "text": "With his words about Ukraine, Pope Francis intended to call for a ceasefire and renew the courage of negotiations . This was stated by Matteo Bruni, director of the Press Service of the Holy See, quoted by Vatican News .\nBruni explained that the Pope’s desire for Ukraine, which he always describes as “martyrdom”, was fully expressed in his words to the Archangel on February 25, the day after the second anniversary of the outbreak of war. The head of the Catholic Church confirmed his “deep affection” for the Ukrainian people. He also called on all countries to “create the conditions for a diplomatic solution in search of a just and lasting peace.”\nBruni pointed out that using the expression “white flag” Pope Francis does not mean the capitulation of Ukraine, but a ceasefire and focus on negotiations.\nStronger is the one who sees the situation, who thinks about the people, who has the courage of the white flag, to negotiate. Even today, negotiations are possible with the help of international forces, the Pope pointed out. In his words, when you see that things are not going well, you must have the courage to negotiate. According to him, there are many countries that are willing to mediate on this.\nThe Vatican points out that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis has repeatedly emphasized the importance of dialogue. The Pope’s hope is to find some humanity to allow the creation of conditions for a diplomatic solution in search of a just and lasting peace.\nThe Pope called on Ukraine to wave the white flag and negotiate with Russia\nMore important than pride was that the number of those killed should not increase\n2024-03-10 08:46:54\n#Vatican #Pope #Francis #called #Ukraine #capitulate\nRelated posts: UNICEF Warns of Unprecedented Child Migration Crisis in Latin America and Caribbean Region \"Lolita, after fifty years of captivity, is liberated from Seaquarium at 57 years of age.\" For the first time in the United States, a successful human heart transplant has been performed Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre's Strong Criticism of Israel's Violation of International Law Predictions of Florida vs Tennessee Predictions 68 bodies recovered from the site of a passenger plane crash in Nepal (second and final expansion) Do you have an advantage?
