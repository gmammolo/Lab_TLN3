  "text": "PM Modi’s outreach to Vladimir Putin prevented ‘potential nuclear strike’ on Ukraine in 2022: Report\nThe role of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in advocating for peace and de-escalation proved crucial in preventing a \"possible\" nuclear conflict amidst the Russia-Ukraine crisis in 2022.\nWashington: As tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated in 2022, the United States took measures to prepare for the possibility of a nuclear strike by Moscow against Kyiv, CNN reported citing senior administration officials. According to the report, the Biden administration was deeply concerned that Russia might resort to using tactical or battlefield nuclear weapons.\nIn response, the US sought assistance from non-allied countries, including India, to dissuade Russia from such an attack. “One of the things we did was not only message them directly but strongly urge, press, and encourage other countries, to whom they might be more attentive, to do the same thing,” a senior administration official said.\nPM Modi’s significant role in averting Russia-Ukraine crisis\nIndia, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, played a significant role in averting the crisis. PM Modi’s outreach and public statements condemning civilian killings and advocating for a peaceful resolution to the conflict were instrumental in international efforts.\n“I think the fact that we know, India weighed in, China weighed in, others weighed in, may have had some effect on their thinking,” the senior administration official added.\nDuring the SCO summit in Uzbekistan, PM Modi said to President Vladimir Putin that “this is not the era of war,” a statement that resonated globally and even made it to the G20 communique under India’s presidency.\nWhat happened in 2022?\nIn late summer and fall 2022, as Russian forces faced setbacks in Ukraine, the National Security Council of the US convened meetings to develop contingency plans. Ukrainian advances on Russian-occupied territories raised concerns within the administration about potential triggers for a nuclear attack. Simultaneously, Russia allegedly circulated a “false flag story” about a Ukrainian dirty bomb, raising fears among US officials that it could be used as a pretext for a nuclear strike.\nDespite these tensions, the US never detected intelligence indicating Russia was mobilising its nuclear forces for an attack. “We obviously placed a high priority on tracking and had some ability at least to track such movements of its nuclear forces,” a senior administration official said. “And at no point did we ever see any indications of the types of steps that we would’ve expected them to take if they were going down a path toward using nuclear weapons,” he added.",
