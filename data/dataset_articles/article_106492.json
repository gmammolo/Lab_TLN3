  "text": "Warren Buffett’s son Howard donates half a billion to Ukraine\n(NewsNation) — As the U.S. Congress is withholding aid that Ukraine says it critically needs, Howard Buffett has emerged as a significant benefactor providing substantial monetary support amid the ongoing war with Russia.\nThe Howard G. Buffett Foundation has donated over half a billion dollars to Ukraine since Russia invaded it.\n“When the full-scale invasion occurred…it was obvious it was going to create a significant issue in terms of global food security,” Buffett said on a Saturday interview on “NewsNation Prime.” He elaborated on the foundation’s dual focus on global food security and conflict mitigation, underlining the urgent need to alleviate the pressing humanitarian crisis precipitated by the conflict in Ukraine.\nNATO’s biggest drills since the Cold War send a signal to Russia and aim for a real-life feel\nBuffett’s perspective on the importance of supporting Ukraine contrasts with the stalled foreign aid package in the United States, where $61 billion earmarked for Ukraine awaits approval in the House.\n“We can’t avoid being engaged in this fight,” Buffet said warning of the potential consequences of inaction, stressing the broader implications for global stability if Ukraine were to fall to Russian aggression.\nAs the United States navigates its own political landscape during the election year, with a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on the horizon, Buffett emphasized the need for visionary leadership capable of understanding the implications of foreign conflicts like the one in Ukraine.\nPoland’s foreign minister says the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine is ‘not unthinkable’\n“We need a leader who can have the vision to understand…what the consequences are to the United States if we don’t support Ukraine,” Buffet said.\nBuffett refrained from endorsing a specific candidate, citing the uncertainty of their future actions and the need for adaptable leadership in response to evolving circumstances.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action in the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.\nZelenskyy said that the number was far lower than estimates given by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government.\nCopyright 2022 Nexstar Media, Inc.
