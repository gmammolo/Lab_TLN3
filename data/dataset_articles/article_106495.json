  "text": "Iran’s naval prowess paves the way for global dominance: MP\nTEHRAN - In a recent announcement, the head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian Parliament underscored the profound global ramifications of achieving maritime dominance for the country.\nVahid Jalalzadeh made the remarks during an end-of-year gathering at the Iranian Navy's headquarters. He emphasized that a country capable of achieving maritime dominance would inevitably command superior influence worldwide.\nAddressing the Leader of Islamic Revolution's directives on maritime activities, Jalalzadeh stressed the imperative to mobilize all capacities for the development of maritime activities and the expansion of the southern Makran coasts.\nCommending the Navy's initiatives in developing the Makran coasts and augmenting the country's maritime power, Jalalzadeh accentuated the pivotal role played by the Iraninan Navy in controlling international trade.\nAcknowledging the diplomatic utility of maritime power as a critical national capability, Jalalzadeh remarked, \"In recent years, when the United States exerted its influence against our interests, the Navy promptly responded, significantly impacting the region and the world. These maneuvers underscored the prowess of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the seas.\"\nReferring to the global mission of Iran’s 86th Naval Fleet, Jalalzadeh noted that the flotilla used was domestically produced, showcasing the capabilities of national production. For the first time in Iran’s naval history, Iran's 86th Naval Fleet, featuring the domestically manufactured Dena Destroyer and Makran forward base ship, returned to the country on May 17, 2023 after completing the inaugural round-the-world mission, having traversed more than 12,000 kilometers of maritime channels over the course of 91 days.\nUnderlining the significance of maritime power, Jalalzadeh clarified, \"Being the first in the sea translates to being the first in the world, and any nation that conquers the sea will undoubtedly wield superior global power. Fortunately, the Iranian Navy has demonstrated considerable growth and development in recent years, deserving both appreciation and gratitude.”\nAmid tensions heightened by foreign intervention in the region, the Islamic Republic is increasing its naval presence in the high seas.\nIran’s Navy has achieved self-sufficiency in manufacturing surface and sub-surface vessels in recent years. It has also increased its presence in international waters to protect naval routes and provide security for merchant vessels and tankers.\nIranian military experts and engineers have made remarkable breakthroughs in manufacturing a broad range of indigenous equipment in recent years, contributing to the armed forces' self-sufficiency.",
