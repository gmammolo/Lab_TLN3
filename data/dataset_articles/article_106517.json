  "text": "site.btaMRF Co-leader Peevski: Rescue of Bulgarian Jews Is Example of National Bravery, Responsibility, Decisiveness The rescue of Bulgarian Jews in 1943 is one of the brightest examples of national bravery, responsibility, and decisiveness of the State and the Bulgarian people, Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) co-leader Delyan Peevski wrote on Facebook on Sunday on the occasion of the 81st anniversary of the rescue of the Bulgarian Jews. It should be remembered that the rescue was made possible amid an exceptionally complex external and internal political situation, and the Bulgarian political elite showed reason, responsibility and a sense of national and all-human duty, the post reads. \"Today, when the political time makes us face no less complex challenges, we should not allow the destructive forces of hate, division, and confrontation in our country and in Europe. So that we can live up to history in the name of the future,\" Peevski wrote. /DS/ news.modal.header news.modal.text",
