  "text": "Billie Eilish , Finneas, Mark Ruffalo, Ava DuVernay, Ramy Youssef and Quannah Chasinghorse are among the latest stars to step onto the red carpet in matching red lapel pins – this time at the Academy Awards .\nAnd though he did not walk the carpet, actor Mahershala Ali also donned one of the pins when helping introduce the nominees for this year's Best Supporting Actor award.\nBut what do they mean?\nLIVE UPDATES: The winners, surprises and biggest moments from the 2024 Oscars\nBillie Eilish is one of many celebrities who have worn the pin on the red carpet. (Getty) Finneas O'Connell joined is sister in wearing the statement pin. (Getty) READ MORE: Full list of Oscar winners\nFeaturing an outline of a hand around a black heart, the pins call for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war , which Palestinian health authorities say has resulted in 30,000 deaths in Gaza since October.\nA group of over 400 celebrities have joined Artists4Ceasefire, a campaign that in late October published a letter urging the US Congress and President Joe Biden to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel.\nIn a press statement, Artists4Ceasefire said: \"The pin symbolises collective support for an immediate and permanent cease-fire, the release of all of the hostages and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.\"\nREAD MORE: Star pulls naked 'streaker' stunt at 2024 Oscars\nAva DuVernay was also among the Oscars attendees to wear the accessory. (Getty) But in contrast to other symbolic accessories like the Time's Up movement, which became ubiquitous at awards shows in 2018 to show support for victims of sexual harrassment, the ceasefire pins have only been seen on a handful of stars on recent red carpets.\nAt this year's Grammy Awards , Boygenius and Annie Lennox notably wore the pins, with Lennox pleading for a ceasefire and peace onstage.\n(Also on the Academy Awards red carpet, actors Milo Machado-Graner and Swann Arlaud of \"Anatomy of a Fall\" wore pins featuring the Palestinian flag.)\nREAD MORE: Robert Downey Jr unimpressed with sobriety joke at Oscars\nAnatomy of a Fall's Milo Machado-Graner and Swann Arlaud wore pins featuring the Palestinian flag. (Getty) On the Oscars red carpet on Sunday, Youssef, a comedian and actor who co-starred in \"Poor Things\" alongside Ruffalo and Emma Stone , expressed frustration with the lack of momentum for an end to the war.\n\"There's no other route,\" Youssef told Variety of calling for a ceasefire.\n\"It's taking so long… That's what we're all encouraging everyone to be vocal about.\"\nOther stars who signed the Artists4Ceasefire letter include Cate Blanchett , Ben Affleck , Jennifer Lopez , Bradley Cooper and America Ferrera .",
