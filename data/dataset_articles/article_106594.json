  "text": "As of the 96th Academy Awards, a notable display of solidarity emerged among celebrities advocating for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Personalities such as Billie Eilish, director Ava DuVernay, Mark Ruffalo, and Ramy Youssef, among others, arrived at the red carpet adorned with red pins, symbolizing their support for peace in the Gaza conflict.\nOscars 2024 Live Updates | Oscars 2024 Winners List\nRamy Youssef pleads for ceasefire\nDuring interviews on the red carpet, Ramy Youssef expressed the collective plea for an immediate and enduring ceasefire, speaking on the need for safety and justice for all parties involved, particularly the Palestinian people. The pins worn by the celebrities were part of an initiative led by Artists4Ceasefire, an alliance within the entertainment industry that sent an open letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to prioritize efforts towards a ceasefire.\nTheir stance resonated with a broader message advocating for peace and stability in the region. The demonstration highlighted the urgency of ending violence, particularly amidst ongoing bombings and escalating tensions. The visible support from high-profile figures underscored a unified call for dialogue and resolution.\nProtestors delay cause disruption\nDespite the protest's delay causing disruptions, including blocking traffic and impeding arrivals, the significance of their advocacy remained steadfast. Their presence at the Oscars served not only as a platform for glamour but also as a voice for humanitarian concerns, amplifying the call for immediate action towards a ceasefire and lasting peace in the region.",
