  "text": "Chennai: From the age of three, Inayat grew up without her father's love and presence in her life. Despite this absence, she decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join the army. Inayat deliberately chose to wear the same uniform her father, Major Navneet Vats, wore before he lost his life battling terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. During the remarkable passing out parade at the Army’s Officers Training Academy in Chennai, the inspirational story of Inayat Vats came to light. Now Lieutenant Inayat Vats, she represents the third generation in her family devoted to military service.Originally from Panchkula, Haryana, Inayat graduated from Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University and is currently pursuing an MA in Political Science at Hindu College.Inayat's mother, Shivani, shared a touching moment when Inayat once asked what she would have done if she were a boy. Shivani responded that she would have encouraged her to join the National Defence Academy (NDA) or the Indian Military Academy (IMA). Despite the possibility of a more comfortable life, Shivani expressed her happiness that Inayat chose to follow in her father's footsteps and join the army.In this manner, Inayat has not only honoured her father's legacy but has also embraced her own ideals by choosing to serve her country in the same way he did.About Her Father, Major Navneet Vats Major Navneet Vats, who hailed from Chandigarh, always harboured a childhood dream of donning the revered 'Olive Green' uniform. He pursued this aspiration and joined the army, eventually being commissioned in the 4th Battalion of the 3 Gorkha Rifles Regiment. His life took on new meaning when he married Shivani, and together they welcomed their daughter, Inayat, into the world. Inayat brought immense joy and cherished moments into Major Navneet's life until tragedy struck on November 20, 2003.Having served diligently with his unit for several years, Major Navneet was deployed to Srinagar with the 32 Rashtriya Rifles, engaged in counter-insurgency operations amidst challenging circumstances. On November 18, 2003, terrorists seized control of a government building in Srinagar, prompting the security forces to launch a joint operation to address the crisis. Two days later, on November 20th, Major Navneet Vats was entrusted with leading the assault team for a critical operation to neutralise the terrorists.The operation was fraught with danger, as the terrorists were entrenched in secure positions within the building, armed with automatic weapons. Undeterred by the risks, Major Navneet fearlessly led his team into the fray. Despite facing heavy gunfire from the well-entrenched terrorists, Major Navneet and his brave comrades pressed forward with determination to eliminate the threat.Tragically, during the intense exchange of fire, Major Vats sustained six bullet wounds to his upper body. Four other courageous soldiers, including a Colonel, were also gravely injured. Despite losing a significant amount of blood from his wounds, Major Navneet valiantly fought on. Regrettably, he succumbed to his injuries, making the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country.For his extraordinary bravery, unwavering fighting spirit, and supreme sacrifice, Major Navneet Vats was posthumously awarded the gallantry medal, the \\\"Sena Medal.\\\" His courageous leadership and selfless actions during the operation will forever be remembered as a testament to his commitment to duty and love for his country.",
