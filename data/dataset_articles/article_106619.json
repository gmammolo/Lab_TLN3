  "text": "From Billie Eilish to Mark Ruffalo, several stars walked the red carpet at the 2024 Oscars sporting red pins in an effort to expedite a Gaza ceasefire. Find out more below.\nPhoto: Instagram.com\nLast night, Hollywood’s most famous faces gathered in California for the 2024 edition of the Academy Awards . The evening was replete with viral moments, from Ryan Gosling’s “I’m Just Ken” performance, to Billie Eilish and Finneas’s slowed down version of “What Was I Made For?” on stage. On the red carpet, however, what had many talking were the fiery red pins sported by the likes of Billie, Mark Ruffalo, Ramy Youssef, and Riz Ahmed, to name a few.\nThe meaning behind the red pins seen at Oscars 2024\nIn an effort to expedite a ceasefire in Gaza, celebrities wore red pins on the Oscars 2024 red carpet, which featured the symbol of a hand with a heart on its palm. The enamel red pin signified their dedication to Artists4Ceasefire, a group of almost 400 entertainment industry members who have signed an open letter to the president of the United States calling for an end to the dire situation in Gaza.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Vogue Arabia (@voguearabia)\nAlong with the celebrities who wore their pins proudly at the Academy Awards (the list also included Finneas, model Quannah Chasinghorse, and filmmaker Ava DuVernay), the Artists4Ceasefire open letter has also been signed by the likes of America Ferrera, Bradley Cooper, and Lupita Nyong’o, who also attended the Oscars, and Jessica Chastain, Cate Blanchett, Drake, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Lopez.\nArtists4Ceasefire pins: Where have they been spotted so far?\nPrior to the Oscars, the red Artists4Ceasefire pins were also seen worn by the American indie supergroup Boygenius at the Grammy awards, by Dua Lipa at the pre-BAFTA celebrations, and by The Bear actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach at the SAG Awards.\nBelow, take a closer look at all the stars who wore the red pin and called for a ceasefire in Gaza last evening.\nFinneas.
