  "text": "New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says Australia is his country’s “number one strategic priority” and its key relationship because “Australia is our only ally”.\nMr Luxon has previously said his number one priority is his relationship with Australia.\n“My job is to work with all leaders across all countries, but no doubt about it, Australia is our number one strategic priority, and it’s our key relationship because Australia is our only ally,” Mr Luxon told Sky News host Erin Molan.\n‘Australia is our only ally’: NZ Prime Minister on his ‘number one strategic priority’\n“I have a great relationship with Anthony Albanese – he’s someone I actually knew in my former life when he was a Minister in Australia, and I was CEO of Air New Zealand.\n“Our job is to get on and actually work together because there’s so much that we have in common, and we are like-minded countries with values that we stand up for and we need to represent in our regions.\n“So, it’s in both of our interests that we have a strong relationship there.”",
