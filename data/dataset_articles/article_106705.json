  "text": "James Stavridis Gives Credit to Biden Administration for Putting Pressure on Israel\nEXCERPT:\nSTAVRIDIS: \"I think it's a better than even chance at the moment, which is higher odds than I would have given three weeks ago or a month ago. Key indicator: Hamas is sending a delegation, physical presence to Cairo. I am hearing that the conversations are progressing. And here I give credit to the Biden Administration, who have done a good job, both putting pressure on Israel, rightfully so, to get to some kind of yes, and through the Arab world, through the leadership and the moneyed side of the Arab world, putting pressure on Hamas. So these are two unwilling parties being somewhat forced toward a compromise position. Katty, I think we’re probably better than even. That’s wonderful. Can I tell you one other thing that’s going well? As we look at a small percentage of the youth of the United States who are protesting on campuses, another group of American youths, U.S. military, are off Gaza, building a pier that’s going to open in the next few days, a floating pier, a maritime miracle that’s going to move 150 to 200 truckloads of humanitarian aid. That’s a pretty good accomplishment.\"",
