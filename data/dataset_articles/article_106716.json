  "text": "“How We Killed 715 Terrorists”: DHQ Shares Details - The Nigerian military opened up on its operations in April as it vowed to end banditry and terrorism in the country - The Nigerian Defence Headquarters disclosed that 715 terrorists were killed and 465 hostages were rescued last month - The director of Defence Media Operation, Maj-Gen. Edward Buba, disclosed this at his biweekly media briefing on troops operational activities in the six geopolitical zones in the country Legit.ng journalist Esther Odili has over two years of experience covering [political parties](https://www.legit.ng/1197958-full-list-political-parties-nigeria-leaders.html) and movements. FCT, [Abuja](https://www.legit.ng/tags/abuja-city-news-today/) - The Nigerian Defence Headquarters (DHQ) said troops killed over 715 terrorists in April, while 465 kidnapped hostages were freed in the same period. As reported by The Punch, the feat, according to the military, was achieved through coordinated ground and air operations. The director of Defence Media Operation, Maj-Gen Edward Buba, made this known during a bi-weekly media briefing in Abuja on Thursday, May 2. According to him, operations in April included ambushes, raids, and fighting patrols, with aerial assets identifying and targeting terrorist leaders and their bases. Buba stressed the non-negotiable defeat of terrorist groups to prevent further harm to citizens. The military in [a post](https://twitter.com/DefenceInfoNG/status/1786054123437068391) sighted by Legit.ng on its website on Friday, May 3, disclosed further that the operation led to the arrest of 146 persons and the rescue of 465 kidnapped hostages. DHQ stressed that the [Nigerian troops](https://www.legit.ng/tags/nigeria-army/) recovered 32,971 assorted weapons and ammunitions and 16,121 barrels of oil during the period. “Tactically, whenever there is a clash between troops and terrorist on the ground, troops clearly win in the fire fight, though sadly in certain operations, casualties are sustained. “However, each and every engagement ends with troops victory, with several dead or surrendered terrorist in every location,” Buba said. Why DHQ released 313 terrorism suspects Meanwhile, Legit.ng earlier reported that the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) had said that the release of [the 313 terrorism suspects](https://www.legit.ng/nigeria/1585734-released-313-terrorism-suspects-nigerian-military-1-major-reason/) to the Borno state government was on the orders of the Federal High Court, Maiduguri division. The Director, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. Edward Buba, who made the clarification on Thursday, March 28, in Abuja, said the suspects were detained on suspicion, but no evidence was found against them at the conclusion of an investigation, [Daily Trust](https://www.legit.ng/tags/kebbi-state-news-today/) reported. According to him, the Federal Ministry of Justice prosecuted the cases, leading to the court’s decision to release them and their subsequent handover to the [Borno state](https://www.legit.ng/tags/borno-state-news-today/) government for further action.
