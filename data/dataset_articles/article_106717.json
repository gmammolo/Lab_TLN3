  "text": "HUBBALLI: Union home minister Amit Shah sought to insulate BJP from the alleged sex scandal involving Prajwal Revanna, insisting that it was the state govt which ought to act, and that BJP would not tolerate atrocity on women.While campaigning for cabinet colleague Pralhad Joshi in Hubballi on Wednesday, Shah said “BJP will not support such people” but that it was a law and order issue which is the domain of the state govt. “The Congress govt was aware of the issue but did not initiate any action till Vokkaligas had voted,” Shah said. “They indulged in politics and allowed him (Prajwal) to escape. Because of you, a heinous criminal fled the country,” Shah said.At the venue, Shah met with the parents of Neha Hiremath, the student who was murdered on her college campus in Hubballi. He consoled them. He sought to pin Congress down on the murder, saying it was the state govt’s responsibility “but the govt shirked its responsibility by saying it was a personal issue”.“They proved they cannot ensure the safety of women in the state,” he said. “Taking advantage of the situation, anti-nationals raised pro-Pa kistan slogans at Vidhana Soudha but chief minister Siddaramaiah said he did not hear it. However, we heard it while sitting in Delhi. Congress has put Karnataka at risk for political gain.”Shah said if Modi is elected again, his govt will end terrorism and Naxalism and peace will prevail in Kashmir, the northeast and all other states affected by terrorism and naxalism.“Three crore mothers will become lakhpatis, three lakh villages will get dairy units, missions like Chandrayaan will continue and register successes,” he said.He said Congress kept the Ram Mandir issue pending “but Modi won court cases” and ensured the consecration of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya. “But Congress brass Mall ikarjun Kharge, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi did not attend out of fear for their vote bank,” he said.”He also accused Siddaramaiah of politicising the drought relief issue.The CM and his deputy DK Shivakumar squabble with each other. The deputy CM tries to pull down the CM... They caused the delay in submitting the request. They sent a third request after polls were announced,” he said.Shah also held a roadshow in Ranebennur, Haveri district, in support of former chief minister and Haveri Lok Sabha BJP candidate Basavaraj Bommai. He said the saffron party will win more seats than Congress in the five southern states and NDA would achieve the target of winning 400 seats.”",
