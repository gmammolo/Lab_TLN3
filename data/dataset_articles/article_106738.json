  "text": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited a hospital in Khmelnytskyi that provides specialized care to members of the Defense Forces.\nThe Head of State was told that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia, about eight thousand Ukrainian defenders have been provided with assistance in this institution. In particular, the institution has introduced comprehensive wound treatment with the use of devices that halve the treatment time, low-trauma shrapnel removal, as well as methods that accelerate wound healing and preserve limb function.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy visited the wounded servicemen, inquired about their health and treatment conditions.\nThe President presented the Order \"For Courage\" of the third class and medals \"For Military Service to Ukraine\" to the servicemen of the Armed Forces and the State Border Guard Service who were wounded in the east, particularly during the defense of Avdiivka, Maryinka and Chasiv Yar in the Bakhmut direction.\n\"Thank you for everything you do for our country. It's a pleasure to be here and award you. Thank you for defending Ukraine. Get well and come back home. I wish you and all of us victory,\" the Head of State said.\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy also awarded medals \"For Saved Life\" to military medics.\n\"First of all, I wish you all, your families and friends good health. You are bringing our warriors back to life. I want to thank you for your daily hard work. We highly appreciate it,\" he said.",
