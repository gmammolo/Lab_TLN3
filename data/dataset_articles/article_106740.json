  "text": "Ukrainians are putting machine guns first designed in the US at the end of World War I on the back of pickup trucks to try to shoot down Russian drones and spy planes.\nSoldiers in Ukraine’s 117th Territorial Defense Brigade are using guns, including the M2 Browning, to try to take down Russia’s Shahed drones,\nthe Kyiv Independent reported.\nThe M2 was used by American forces in World War II, and is still used by some today, but it was initially developed in 1918, the last year of World War I.\nThe Kyiv Independent, which visited one Ukrainian unit, reported that they are often the first to confront drones that Russia fires north, toward the cities of Sumy and Kyiv.\nIts members monitor the sky, watch their tracking equipment, and drive where needed, eager to shoot down whatever they can.\nRussia has been firing drones and missiles at Ukrainian cities and infrastructure since it launched its full-scale invasion, often targeting places far from the front lines.\nThese attacks have killed civilians, destroyed residential buildings, and damaged Ukraine’s energy network.\nUkraine faces a dilemma when it comes to shooting them down.\nShahed drones are\nestimated to cost around $20,000 each, but some of the air-defense missiles that Ukraine has in its arsenal have a price tag in the millions.\nUkraine’s supply of air-defense missiles has also been running low after Republicans stalled billions in further aid for six months.\nSoldiers often had to make difficult choices about when to use their precious stockpile.\nThat’s where weapons like the M2 Browning come in.\nIts predecessor, the M1917, was\ndesigned by American John Browning and first used in 1917, with the M2 coming the following year.\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have\nused decades-old equipment and weaponry in the war, sometimes because it is proven to be reliable and sometimes due to shortages of more modern supplies.\nThe unit’s leader, call sign Dias, described the Browning to the Kyiv Independent as “reliable, user-friendly” and with a higher fire rate.\nBut he and other soldiers still said they desired more modern weapons: “We’re eager to take down Shaheds. We could cut them with such weapons,” he said.\nDias’ unit is made up of 16 soldiers, who were all civilians before Russia’s invasion, the outlet reported.\nDias, who had combat experience, said he “taught them to shoot and survive” and that they have downed six Shaheds and 12 reconnaissance aircraft.\nHe described the unit as protecting the city of Sumy, which is close to the border with Russia, and said that his unit works within range of Russian artillery, guided bombs, and first-person-view drones.\nAnother soldier described the wider region to the Kyiv Independent as “Ukraine’s northern shield.”\nHe called their group “the last defensive line” for the area.\nThe post\nUkrainians on pickup trucks are using machine guns designed in WWI to stop Russian drones appeared first on Business Insider.",
