  "text": "Germany has handed over a Skynex air defense system to Ukraine in its latest tranche of military aid to bolster the country's air defense. The platform is the latest of an 182-million euro ($192 million) deal in 2022 between Germany and Rheinmetall to equip Ukraine with the anti-missile capability. The integrated tracking unit will be used to counter air targets from Russian forces, performing short-range searches, classification, and identification of threatening aircraft and missiles in Kyiv's airspace. The latest package also includes ammunition for the air defense system, as well as 10 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, medium-range missiles, a surveillance radar, and tank transporter tractors. Since 2022, Germany has provided around 5.2 billion euros ($5.6 billion) in supplies to Kyiv. Additional assistance from Berlin includes military training for 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers and treatment and rehabilitation of injured troops. Skynex at a Glance Rheinmetall's Skynex system is a short-range air defense capability with a modular design to help customize its sensors and effectors to fit various mission requirements. Each Skynex system is composed of four Revolver Gun Mk3 cannons, a CN-1 control node, and an X-TAR3D radar. Its operators include Romania and Austria, both of which use the platform as their premier capability for airspace monitoring.",
