  "text": "A wreath was laid in Budapest, Hungary’s capital, on Friday to honor Hannah Szenes, the courageous paratrooper who embarked on a perilous mission during World War II and tragically did not return. The ceremony was a poignant reminder of Szenes’ bravery. Szenes, celebrated for her heroism and sacrifice, undertook a mission to assist Allied forces in Europe and aid Jewish communities suffering under Nazi oppression. Although captured, tortured, and executed at just 23 years old, her legacy lives on, particularly in Israel, where she is revered as a national hero. Rakefet Senesh-Shkiler, her great-grandniece, addressed a group of journalists, sharing the story of Szenes’ courage and sacrifice. She highlighted the importance of remembering Szenes’ plight and spoke of the October 7 attack on southern Israel, which deeply impacted her and the nation. Senesh-Shkiler drew parallels between the resilience and strength of her great-aunt and the spirit needed to overcome the challenges faced today.",
