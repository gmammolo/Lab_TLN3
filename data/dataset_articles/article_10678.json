  "text": "After falling to the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday evening, the New York Yankees have now lost six straight games. While they still remain atop the American league East standings, New York is amid a very concerning stretch of play. The reigning American League champions have struggled in nearly every facet of the game recently, but most notably on offense. That said, it was a defensive miscue by shortstop Anthony Volpe in the eighth inning of Wednesday night’s game that has been receiving the most attention. On what should have been an inning-ending double play off the bat of Angels outfielder Jo Adell, Volpe not only booted the grounder, but threw wildly to second base. The Yankees got no outs on the play, and that run-scoring error ended up being the difference in the game. Making things worse for Volpe, he struck out in the bottom of the ninth inning with the tying run on base. It was an all-around night to forget for the Yankees shortstop. Speaking postgame, Volpe said of his error, \"Right off the bat, I've got to be aggressive. Go get the ball and make the play. As far as that, that's all it is. It's the first read off the bat.\" Of his recent play, Volpe added ( via SNY Yankees ), \"I know I can do better. Everyone holds themselves to really high standards and we know we're not getting the job done.\" Facing the Angels again on Thursday, New York will look to salvage the series and snap this losing streak. The Yankees will have left hand or Carlos Rodon on the mound, while the Angels will also be going to a southpaw in Tyler Anderson.
