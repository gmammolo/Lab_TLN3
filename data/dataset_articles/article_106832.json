This contract, awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime, Columbus, Ohio, is part of an open season period to increase the number of JLTVCI Prime Vendors and will coincide with the original contract.\nWith vast experience in Government & Defense contracting and a deep knowledge of customers’ needs, SupplyCore is a leading supply chain Prime Vendor. For 36 years, the company has helped the Department of Defense remain mission-ready both domestically and abroad.\nThrough this contract, which went live on April 3, SupplyCore’s team will support Army, Navy, and Marine requirements to repair or replace any item or system used on JLTV vehicles, including, but not limited to: vehicular structural components; power transmission components; engines and fuel system components; various gears, belts, and bearings; material handling equipment; pipes, tubes, hoses, and valves; vehicle maintenance and repair shop equipment; various fasteners; commercial and weapon system hardware; communication equipment; electrical components, modules, and assemblies; cable, cord, and wire assemblies; engine instruments; and various instruments and associated test equipment.\n“Through our Weapon Systems Support division, SupplyCore supports the warfighter by providing spare parts and end items for land, aviation and maritime platforms and systems,” said Peter Provenzano, President & CEO. “Our strong partnerships with industry-leading OEMs enable us to provide customers with the brand-specific and certified JLTV spare parts they need to remain mission ready.”\nThe primary goal of the JLTVCI program is to consolidate isolated JLTV requirements under a single contract vehicle to improve ordering for U.S. federal agency and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.
