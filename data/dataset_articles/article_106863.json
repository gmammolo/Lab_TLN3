  "text": "“This is the Army’s number one modernization priority,” said Brig. Gen. Wally Rugen, director of the Future Vertical Lift Cross-Functional Team. “This aircraft is going to be a game-changer for the Army.”\nThe new aircraft will replace the UH-60 Black Hawk, which has been in service since the 1970s. The Black Hawk has been a reliable and versatile aircraft, but it is starting to show its age. The new aircraft will be faster, more maneuverable, and more survivable than the Black Hawk.\nThe Defiant X and the V-280 Valor are both impressive aircraft. The Defiant X is a compound helicopter, which means that it has both a traditional rotor and a pusher propeller. This gives it the speed and range of a fixed-wing aircraft, but the maneuverability of a helicopter. The V-280 Valor is a tiltrotor aircraft, which means that its rotors can tilt to allow it to take off and land vertically, but also fly like a fixed-wing aircraft. Both aircraft are armed with a variety of weapons, including guns, missiles, and rockets.\nThe Army will select the winner of the FLRAA competition in 2022. The first aircraft are expected to be delivered to Army aviation units in 2030.\nThe new combat helicopter will be a major upgrade for the Army. It will give soldiers the ability to move quickly and safely across the battlefield, and it will provide them with the firepower they need to defeat their enemies.\nHere is a table that compares the Defiant X and the V-280 Valor:\nDefiant X V-280 Valor Type Compound helicopter Tiltrotor aircraft Speed 300 mph 300 mph Range 1,200 miles 2,100 miles Maneuverability More maneuverable than the Black Hawk Less maneuverable than the Black Hawk Survivability More survivable than the Black Hawk Less survivable than the Black Hawk Armament Guns, missiles, rockets Guns, missiles, rockets The Army is confident that the new combat helicopter will be a game-changer for the service. It will give soldiers the ability to move quickly and safely across the battlefield, and it will provide them with the firepower they need to defeat their enemies.",
