  "text": "Bengaluru: Flying Wedge Defence and Aerospace Technologies, an Indian defence and aerospace company, Friday marked a milestone in Bengaluru by unveiling the FWD-200B, pegged to be the country’s first indigenous bomber unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The FWD-200B is a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle designed and manufactured entirely in India. With a payload capacity of 100kg, it can carry optical surveillance payloads as well as precision air-strike weapons, the firm said.Addressing the unveiling ceremony in Bengaluru, Suhas Tejaskanda, founder, Flying Wedge Defence, said FWD-200B fulfils India’s long-awaited dream of producing a combat UAV indigenously after years of failed attempts by agencies like Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).“A key highlight is the massive cost reduction achieved. While an imported US Predator drone costs a staggering Rs 250 crore, the Indian-made FWD-200B will be available for just Rs 25 crore — one-tenth of the cost,” the firm said. Tejaskanda added that this demonstrated the company’s commitment to self-reliance and positions India as a leader in cost-effective defence solutions.“With a 12-20 hour endurance, 200 kts/370 kmph max speed, and 200km ground control station range, FWD-200B is envisioned as the “nation’s eagle eye” and an aerial shield against threats,” the firm said, adding its unveiling marks a major boost to India’s Make in India initiative and reduces dependency on costly imports for strategic defence equipment like UAVs.We also published the following articles recentlyIndias first indigenous bomber UAV unveiled in BengaluruFlying Wedge Defence introduced the FWD-200B, India's initial indigenous bomber UAV in Bengaluru, showcasing self-reliance with cost-effective solutions.
