  "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — From Ukraine to Knoxville — the sound of a violin followed Marki Lukyniuk wherever he went. He arrived in Knoxville as a refugee, after Russia invaded Ukraine and began around two years of intense fighting. That never stopped him from playing violin, though, and he brought his music across the world. \"Violin is just something that I've been playing since I can remember myself,\" he said. \"It's been to Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Poland, gosh, in the U.S.\" He is only 23 years old but captivated the hearts of East Tennesseans during his performances. He performed at hundreds of events and produced his own music, making his mark on Rocky Top through creativity and talent. \"I showed people something that they never saw before, and never heard before,\" he said. \"It's a part of me.\" He said he started playing when he was around 5 years old, and the instrument eventually helped him find a one-way ticket to the U.S. He arrived in 2022 after fleeing the war, hoping to continue his education. \"I knew that it's not safe to stay in my country, and I wanted to finish my bachelor's degree. I wanted to pursue music,\" he said. He has performed at benefit concerts, raising money to support Ukraine. Despite being so far away from home, he embraced his roots. \"To show people how beautiful Ukraine is, and how much talent we have,\" he said. \"I would like to thank everybody who kept supporting me, I'm going to miss you guys.\" He said after graduating from the University of Tennessee's School of Music, he plans to attend the University of Miami as he pursues a master's degree. Spring commencement will start on May 16, when students will start walking across the stage claiming their degrees. It will go through May 20 and will take place in the Food City Center.",
