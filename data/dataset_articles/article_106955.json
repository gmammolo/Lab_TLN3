  "text": "The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Navy’s indigenous warship Shahid Mahdavi has made history by crossing the Equator and entering the Southern Hemisphere. The 2,100-tonne vessel, equipped with advanced weaponry and communication systems, achieved this milestone on Friday as part of Iran’s efforts to expand its naval presence in international waters. Designed for long-range operations, the Shahid Mahdavi joined the IRGC’s naval fleet in March 2023 and has since demonstrated its capabilities by launching ballistic missiles and carrying various attack helicopters, combat drones, and fast attack craft. The warship’s radar, missiles, and electronic warfare systems showcase Iran’s remarkable advancements in indigenous military technology. Iranian officials emphasize that the country’s defense capabilities, including missile power, are solely for defensive purposes and are not up for negotiation. Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, has consistently emphasized the importance of strengthening the country’s defense capabilities to ensure national security. As the Shahid Mahdavi continues its journey in the Southern Hemisphere, Iran’s commitment to self-sufficiency in defense technology remains unwavering. The IRGC’s oceangoing warship represents a significant achievement in Iran’s efforts to bolster its military readiness and protect its sovereignty.
