  "text": "Guest speaker for graduation was retired U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Travis Mills, one of five quadruple amputees from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, who became an avid advocate for veterans. Mills and his wife Kelsey started the nonprofit Travis Mills Foundation, which helps post-9/11 veterans who were injured while serving their country. Mills also is a motivational speaker, actor and author. There were five valedictorians this year, all with 4.0 grade point averages and all earning Bachelor of Science degrees. They were: David James Bubar of Bangor, video/film production and certificates in digital and social media marketing and in web media; Anna Elizabeth Coleman of Swanville, English; MacKenzie L. Dore of Holden, criminal justice with a focus in national/corporate security, and a Master of Science in criminal Justice; Molly Eesa Dutil of Augusta, health sciences; Andrew C. Green of Bangor, accounting, and a Master of Business Administration. The salutatorian was Emily E. Doten of Baring, with a Bachelor of Science in health sciences. “We are immensely proud of our 125th graduating class and their remarkable accomplishments while students at Husson University,” said President Robert A. Clark. “Their achievements are a testament to their unwavering determination and the exceptional education they have received at Husson. We are confident that they will go on to make a positive impact in their respective fields and communities.”",
