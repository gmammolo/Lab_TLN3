  "text": "(ANSA) – ROME, MAY 04 – “Timely and adequate decisions on the air defense of Ukraine, timely supply of weapons to our soldiers: this is what we need right now to protect human lives”: this is written on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. “This week alone, terrorists have carried out more than 380 attacks on our cities and regions,” continues Zelensky, who cites the regions of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Kherson and Odessa. “And this happens every week of this war,” he adds. “The daily and deliberate Russian terror against people, our cities and villages can be stopped. Partners have all the necessary systems, all the necessary weapons so that Ukraine can protect life – concludes the message -. Thank you to all leaders and states who understand that prompt delivery and full implementation of the agreements is what protects not only Ukrainians, but also every nation that could be targeted by Russian terrorism.” (HANDLE).\n© All rights reserved\n#Zelensky #timely #decisions #Ukraines #air #defense\n– 2024-05-04 16:00:10\nRelated posts: Nissan to Exclusively Supply New York's Next 'Yellow Cab' La Jornada - Boris Johnson, European right in decline French Artist Christophe Vacher's Journey from Disney Animator to Lunar Art Contributor Episode 2610 from January 13th, 2022 | Berlin - Day Share this: Facebook X",
