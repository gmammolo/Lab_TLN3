  "text": "Gaza Ceasefire Talks Continue As Hamas Delegation Arrives in Cairo\nGaza Ceasefire Talks Continue As Hamas Delegation Arrives in Cairo Signs of Compromise Emerge in Indirect Talks Hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza rose on Saturday as a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo to continue indirect talks. These talks are believed to be in response to a new proposal to halt fighting for an initial 40 days and exchange hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Sources report signs of compromise in recent days.\nWhile a consensus has been reached on many of the disputed points, both sides remain pessimistic after five months of stop-start talks.\nChallenges Faced in Negotiations The negotiations face challenges as Hamas seeks a lasting ceasefire that would allow the organization to claim victory, while Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, aims to dismantle Hamas, eliminate its leadership, and neutralize its military capabilities.\nIsraeli Official Downplays Prospects for Full Ceasefire An anonymous senior Israeli official played down the prospects for a full end to the war, emphasizing Israel’s commitment to an offensive on Rafah. They stated that Israel would not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a hostage-release deal.\nWhile Israel plans to give the truce talks another week, a full-scale offensive in Rafah may be imminent.\nUS Urges Hamas to Accept Ceasefire Deal The United States has been applying pressure on Hamas to accept the latest proposals to avert intensified fighting. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced concerns about the potential civilian casualties in the event of a Rafah offensive and stressed the need for a credible protection plan by Israel.\nCalls to Call Off Rafah Attack Increase Various parties, including humanitarian groups, the United Nations, and the WHO director general, have once again urged Israel to call off the planned Rafah attack. Concerns regarding civilian casualties and the impact on an already weakened healthcare system have been expressed.\nDivided Hamas and Israeli Government Hamas, currently divided, is purportedly considering the latest truce proposal. The delegation in Cairo is led by Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy head of the group’s political arm in Gaza, and not a more senior figure. The senior members of Israel’s war cabinet are inclined to secure a ceasefire and free surviving prisoners, while certain far-right ministers advocate for a more forceful continuation of the war.\nAid Efforts Amidst Severe Situations The situation in Gaza remains dire, with the siege pushing its population to famine’s brink. Aid deliveries have slightly improved, with some staple prices approaching pre-war levels. Efforts by organizations like World Central Kitchen and the push for a maritime aid corridor from Cyprus have contributed to addressing the situation. However, the UN’s food program still warns of a full-blown famine in northern Gaza despite the recent improvements.",
