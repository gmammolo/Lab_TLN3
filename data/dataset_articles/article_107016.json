  "text": "Comment: Almost half the world is voting in national elections this year and artificial intelligence is the elephant in the room.\nThere are genuine fears AI-generated or AI-edited deepfakes will potentially manipulate election outcomes not just in the US and UK, but critically in countries such as India.\nFor that reason, the need for highly trained journalists who can produce trusted, accurate and original reporting is firmly in the spotlight.\nread more Business Stuff takes a big risk on Newshub Comment TVNZ – a last bastion of current affairs falls This year has seen an acceleration in the use of AI technologies, which can boost legitimate political campaigns but also be employed by bad actors to influence outcomes. These tools, combined with lack of regulation on social media platforms, is a grave worry for anyone who supports democracy.\nBut for those of us preparing the next generation of journalists, it’s a challenge to further enhance the technical and soft skills that lead to excellent public interest journalism.\nThe deepfakes fear AI has been used for more than a decade in the US, providing automated earthquake warnings for the Los Angeles Times . But it is now being used by journalists in far smaller newsrooms to, among other things, generate quick rewrites of up to 50 press releases at a time.\nThe European Union is leading the way in developing ethical guidelines for dealing with AI that are “human centric”. There are seven requirements considered key in the EU for achieving trustworthy AI. They include human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; societal and environmental wellbeing, and accountability.\nBut globally, people are concerned. Software company Adobe has just released a Future of Trust Study , which surveyed more than 6000 people across the US, UK, France and Germany about their experiences encountering misinformation online and concerns about the impact of generative AI.\nThe study shows more than 80 percent of respondents in each nation were concerned the content they consume online was vulnerable to being altered to mislead or deceive.\nA significant number said it was becoming difficult to verify if the content they were consuming online was trustworthy, and most believed that misinformation and harmful deepfakes would impact future elections.\nThey generally believed governments and technology companies should work together to protect election integrity against deepfakes and misinformation.\nThose surveyed were quite right to be fearful, with the recent Solomon Islands election awash with fake information.\nThe role of verified journalists While Australia might be lagging with regulation around AI, it has led the way in forcing big tech companies to support the provision of journalism through its news bargaining code by making them pay local news publishers for news content available on their platforms.\nDespite Australia’s world-leading laws, Meta has already warned it will remove news rather than support its continued existence within Facebook. It’s a move being labelled anti-democratic by Australian politicians.\nHaving access to balanced news and information, prepared by well-trained journalists, is one of the best ways to fight misinformation and disinformation spread across social media.\nBut that trust only comes when the news is fair and transparent, represents all in the community, and is provided by people who sign up to an ethical framework.\nIt’s one reason academics are pushing for accreditation of journalists in Australia so those who sign up to an ethical code of conduct and complaints process can be differentiated from those who do not.\nWhile journalists certainly have a lot more to do to rebuild relationships with audiences, that job is almost impossible if we cannot clearly identify who is, and more importantly, who is not a credible and ethical journalist.\nRethinking the news business model Around the globe, governments, philanthropists and businesses that care about democracy are continuing to look for ways to save the flailing news industry.\nDespite a range of initiatives to support journalism, from tax breaks for hiring journalists in New York, to philanthropic grants, the number of news deserts continues to rise with the closure of long-running newspapers like the 125-year-old Barrier Truth in Broken Hill, in far west New South Wales.\nAustralia’s media market is being tracked by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, which has found much resilience in the provision of news across most local government areas with few areas that have no reporting at all.\nHowever, there is very little court reporting in regional Australia, and while regional and city governments are generally well covered, that is less true of regional shires and metropolitical councils.\nCEOs more concerned about the financial bottom line than they are about the provision of news to the public are continuing to close operations.\nNew Zealand’s long-running television news programme, Newshub , is due to close mid-year with the loss of 200 jobs thanks to a decision by the US media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery.\nThe decision was set to leave the state-owned TVNZ network as the only source of free TV news in the country until a last-minute deal by the NZ media outlet Stuff was struck to provide another English-language news programme, albeit slimmed down.\nLegislation is often slow to catch up with technological innovations but, in a year packed with elections, the stakes have never been so high to keep pace with emerging threats.\nThe financial pressures on the media industry are not disappearing but, with proactive government support and savvy work from those dedicated to preserving democracy, a way forward is tenable.\nAlexandra Wake is an associate professor of journalism at RMIT University and the elected president of the Journalism Education and Research Association of Australia. She is an active leader, educator and researcher in journalism.\nOriginally published under Creative Commons by 360info ™.",
