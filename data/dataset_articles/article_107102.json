  "text": "Chinese influence could halt Putin's war in Ukraine – Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski, the Polish Foreign Minister, suggested that China might be able to compel Russian leader Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine He made these [remarks](https://www.rmf24.pl/raporty/raport-wojna-z-rosja/news-sikorski-niech-putin-zastanawia-sie-co-zrobimy,nId,7490471#crp_state=1) in an interview with the BBC, as reported by RMF 24. Sikorski proposed that the conflict in Ukraine might only cease when Putin realizes that \"the cost of its continuation, in terms of human lives and financial expenses, exceeds the objectives he seeks to achieve.\" Simultaneously, according to the Polish minister, the Ukrainian war won't come to a close anytime soon. \"There are various potential mediators - Turkey, the UN. China could indeed pressure Putin to end this war. However, I don't see any indications that Putin is inclined to engage in negotiations,\" stated Radosław Sikorski. He also highlighted the possibility of the European Union bolstering military assistance to Ukraine. The politician emphasized that the EU's overall financial aid to Ukraine surpasses that of the USA. - US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [criticized](https://global.espreso.tv/world-news-blinken-china-aids-russian-defense-amid-sanctions-pressure)China for supplying equipment to the Russian defense industry, asserting that the Chinese cannot \"play both sides\" in efforts to resolve the conflict and enhance relations between Beijing and Europe. - News [More news](https://global.espreso.tv/news?page=2)",
