  "text": "‘Iranian private sector ready to help Syria’s reconstruction’\nTEHRAN – The Head of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines, and Agriculture (ICCIMA) Samad Hassanzadeh has said that the Iranian private sector is ready to help the reconstruction of Syrian infrastructure and industrial sector.\nHassanzadeh made the remarks during a meeting in Tehran on Wednesday with his Syrian counterpart Muhammad Abu Al-Hoda Al-Lahham, the ICCIMA portal reported.\nThe meeting took place as a Syrian delegation is on a visit to the Iranian capital to participate in Iran Expo 2024.\nAddressing the meeting, the Iranian side said that the low level of exchange between Iran and Syria is mainly due to the failure to implement a free trade agreement signed between the two countries 13 years ago, as well as, problems in the way of banking transactions.\nHassanzadeh said that Syria should give a list of its priorities and plans to Iran so that the Iranian investors can help with the reconstruction and renovation of the industries of the war-hit country.\nHe stressed that the expansion of economic cooperation between Iran and Syria would require the establishment of regular transportation lines and further money exchanges between the two countries.\nThe president of the Federation of Syrian Chambers of Commerce, in the meantime, said that the volume of trade exchanges between Iran and Syria does not match their political relations.\nAl-Lahham noted that problems in the way of road transportation, trade tariffs, as well as monetary and financial exchanges are the main obstacles hindering bilateral trade between Iran and Syria.\nHe welcomed the presence of Iranian companies in construction projects in Syria, voicing the readiness of his country to provide the Iran Chamber of Commerce with a list of the Syrian priorities for development and reconstruction.\nEF/\nPhoto: ICCIMA Head Samad Hassanzadeh (R) and his Syrian counterpart Muhammad Abu Al-Hoda Al-Lahham meet in Tehran",
