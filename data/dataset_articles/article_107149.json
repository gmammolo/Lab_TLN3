  "text": "An end to the Israeli aggression on the Palestinian people is an \"essential and rational\" prerequisite to a mediated deal between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli regime, the head of Hamas' Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, stated on Sunday, according to the Lebanese Al Mayadeen TV.\nHaniyeh affirmed the Islamic Resistance movement's positive approach to the current round of negotiations in Cairo. Hamas discussed the issue with Palestinian factions and mediators, holding \"concentrated meetings\" among its leaders in Gaza and elsewhere, before sending its negotiating delegation to Egypt, Haniyeh added.\nThe delegation was informed of the movement's \"positive and flexible\" position on a deal, the top official explained.\nHowever, negotiators were informed on the importance of prioritizing an end to the aggression on the Palestinian people; an \"essential and rational\" stance, Haniyeh added.\nHe said that an end to the Israeli war on Gaza would lay the groundwork for a more \"stable future\".\nHaniyeh questioned the viability of an agreement if a ceasefire is not its initial result.\n\"The world has become a hostage to an extremist government, plagued by a vast array of political problems and crimes committed in Gaza,\" Haniyeh underlined.\nMNA",
