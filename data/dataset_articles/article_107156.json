  "text": "In an interview recently granted to the press on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory, Hung highlighted the victory’s immense historical significance in the national liberation struggle of the three Indochinese countries in general and Vietnam and Laos in particular, saying that following the glorious Dien Bien Phu Victory, which \"resounded across the five continents and shook the globe\", on July 21, 1954, the Geneva Accords ending hostilities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia was signed, under which France and the countries participating in the conference pledged to respect the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the three countries. This laid an important international legal foundation for their people to gradually regain national independence and reunification in each country. To uphold the tradition of friendship and solidarity among the people of the three nations, he called for promoting patriotism, the spirit of independence, national pride, self-reliance and determination to overcome challenges. | | Vietnamese Ambassador to Laos Nguyen Ba Hung. (Photo: VNA) With regards to the Vietnam-Laos relationship, the ambassador suggested deepening political ties via the effective implementation of high-level agreements and educational campaigns about the bilateral special relations. To expand bilateral economic ties, he said it is crucial to offer all possible support to businesses and people of both nations while fully tapping the benefits of existing free trade agreements to extend markets and draw more capital. Hung further noted the immense sense of pride and inspiration the Dien Bien Phu Victory evokes in Vietnamese citizens, especially the younger generation. He described this victory as a powerful source of motivation, encouraging their active involvement in national development and defence efforts. The diplomat concluded by expressing his hope that the people of Vietnam and Laos will continue to build upon their tradition of solidarity and partnership, maintain faith in the leadership of both Parties, and work together to leverage each other's advantages for mutual development.",
