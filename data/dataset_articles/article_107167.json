  "text": "The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, has commended Senate President, Godswill Akpabio for his role in the passage of the South-East Development Commission Bill, following its third reading in the Red Chamber. Speaking at the homecoming reception of the Senate President in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State on Friday, Kalu who also represented the Speaker of the House, Abbas Tajudeen, said that the bill when assented to by the President will heal the wounds caused by the Nigerian civil war. A statement issued on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Levinus Nwabughiogu, quoted Kalu as saying, “We want to thank you for how you supported the South East Development Commission Bill. You showed that you are a good leader and good in-law knowing that the South East over the five decades has not enjoyed the reconciliation and rehabilitation that they needed, post-civil war. “And you believed alongside myself that it is a strategic tool. With that bill, we will give answers to all the hydra-headed questions in the mind of the South Eastern people. I thank you, for that has brought a lot of peace in the South-East because there’s hope that the President will assent to it.” Kalu also commended Akpabio for the amicable working relationship between the parliament and the executive arm, saying, “I want to commend you for the support you’ve given to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Your support is genuine and sincere. “You’ve exemplified the fact that though we are three arms of government, we are one government with one national objective. “The renewed Hope Agenda of the executive, Mr Senate President, has influenced the legislative agenda of the parliament. And you’ve consciously, deliberately ensured that at all times, necessary support is given to the executive for them to achieve their goal. Little wonder we have the cohesion that we enjoy in Nigeria between the arms of government. “Many don’t know that if you let loose, there will be a lot of trouble between the two chambers. We’ll speak in different tones. Because of your leadership style, your partnership spirit, the Senate and the House of Representatives at all times speak with one voice. Thank you for your leadership.”",
