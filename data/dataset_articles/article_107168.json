  "text": "Bochum above: VfL left Berlin defeated on the ground. Source: dpa VfL Bochum the duel is in the basement Berlin Union decide for themselves. Coach Heiko Butscher’s team won 4:3 (3:0) against their rivals with the same points. With success in a wild roller-coaster game, VfL has taken a big step towards staying in the league and has exacerbated the relegation worries at 1. FC Union Berlin, which was deserted for half time. Berlin is no longer useful in catching up Even a big increase in Berlin’s performance after the break was no longer of any use. The race to catch up was not crowned. There is only one point from the last six games under (current) coach Nenad Bjelica. Bundesliga football away and can no longer be put down straight, it seems that the rescue of the Union in the state of the first half will only be possible if the competition is out Mainz and Cologne there are no more scores. Double pack from Wittek Bundesliga RB Leipzig given in August 2019. Back then it was a lesson, this time it was a breakdown and a mortgage that was too much for the second half. After three recent defeats, Union Berlin got a point with the 0-0 draw in Mönchengladbach, but the Iron Men were not happy about it. Gladbach must continue to shake as well.29.04.2024 | 8:38 minutes Maximilian Wittek (16th / 31st minute), Keven Schlotterbeck (37th) and Philipp Hofmann (70th) scored the goals for the relief hosts on Sunday in the sold-out stadium at the Alte Försterei with 22,012 spectators. Yorbe Vertessen (59th), Chris Bedia (62nd) with his first Bundesliga goal and Benedict Hollerbach (74th) gave Berlin precious moments of hope in the end. Coach Bjelica’s chair moves nervously Where there is a crisis, there is a lot of talk. This is no different in the Union. Before it started, club boss Dirk Zingler strongly opposed the “kicker” report that Bjelica would be over in the Köpenick area after the season anyway. The deadline for media admissions could now be reached quickly. Robin Gosens was recently missing from Nagelsmann’s national coaching team. What still gives him hope for his possible participation in the European Championship and how he sees his future at Union Berlin.31.03.2024 | 22:31 min With their performance up to the half-time whistle, the Iron Men did not give the impression that Bjelica had given any impetus to the long rescue. The first half was a waste for Berlin Bochum’s team showed their shortcomings with their quick first attack. Wittek had little trouble firing home a cross from Moritz Broschinski to give VfL the lead. Because it was so easy, the 28-year-old repeated his task on his own fifteen minutes later. Four Union professionals looked on politely from a safe non- football distance. “Wake up,” said the fans. A deep sleep followed the Iron Ones. Schlotterbeck – a non-relegation hero in the Union’s debut season in the Bundesliga in 2020 – was invited not to face the third goal for the visitors. “We’re staying in,” said the Bochum fans. Bochum defends its lead until the end against FC Bayern at 1:5 The second half was almost bearable two weeks ago. But against Bochum? There was a team on the pitch without any enthusiasm, without any will. But important words must have been spoken at half-time. This time the lead: In the 3-2 victory against TSG Hoffenheim, VfL Bochum did not let the butter escape them so often and collected important points in the relegation battle.29.04.2024 | 7:26 min After three changes (Aaronson, Bedia, Vertessen) and a tactical change, the fighting spirit of the Union was back. Vertessen and Bedia’s goals were forced in Union style. But there was no happy ending in Berlin. With his goal, Hofmann showed the characteristics of a center forward that the Union needs, even if Hollerbach gave hope again.
