  "text": "Area Veterans, families gather to attend Purple Heart Memorial unveiling ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - The LZ Peace group welcomes veterans and their families to the Purple Heart Memorial unveiling event. The [Purple Heart](https://purpleheartfoundation.org/), created in 1782 by George Washington, is a U.S. military decoration awarded to those wounded or killed in action. Military member that are bestowed with a Purple Heart medal are recognized to have greatly sacrificed themselves, or paid the ultimate price while in the line of duty. On Saturday, Sgt. Nick Parnello and his squadron held an unveiling ceremony and gifted replicas of the memorial to Purple Heart veterans at the Midway Village LZ Peace Memorial, 6595 Guilford Road. “Today was a very, very special day, and it was certainly special to those veterans who received a Purple Heart,” LZ Peace President Nick Parnello says. “Today we were able to meet with those Purple Heart veterans, and we had General Jorge out to honor them... It was a special ceremony.” The LZ Peace group has worked to bring the ceremony to fruition for almost two years, noting the LZ Purple Heart Memorial to be the first in the midwest.
