  "text": "(Gray News) - A postal worker reportedly went hundreds of miles off his route to make a special delivery.\nPeople reports Grand Prairie United States Postal Service carrier Alvin Gauthier helped a family reunite with World War II-era letters sent from their loved one who was serving in the Army.\nGauthier shared he knew the importance of the letters when he came across them in his work bag.\n“I was getting ready for my route and found some letters that were dated back to 1942,” KXAS quoted Gauthier. “My main thought was I have to find this family.”\nHowever, the letters offered few details other than being addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Lamb who lived in Jacksonville, Arkansas.\nKARK reported that Gauthier contacted its news team for assistance, and they were able to find Jo Ann Smith whose brother was Marion Lamb, the soldier who wrote the letters addressed to their parents.\nGauthier shared he decided to take a road trip from Texas to Arkansas on his day off to deliver the letters.\n“Sometimes you have to go above and beyond,” KXAS quoted Gauthier.\nGauthier, a Marine Corps veteran himself, arrived at Smith’s door with the letters after about a reported 5.5-hour drive.\nSmith thanked Gauthier for going above and beyond in delivering the letters. She said they are a reminder of the sacrifices her brother made.\nCopyright 2024 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.",
