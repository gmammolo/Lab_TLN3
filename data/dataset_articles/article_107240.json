  "text": "<p>Région de Donetsk, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th May, 2024) In a small house near the front line, the location a closely guarded secret, around 40 Ukrainian soldiers gathered for a copious breakfast to celebrate the Orthodox Easter.</p><p> Gathered in a canteen, where the windows were blacked out with tarpaulins, the men of the 24th motorised brigade lined up in front of the chaplain.</p><p> Under the harsh light of the lightbulb, the faces appeared tired after more than two years of harrowing warfare.</p><p> Singing, prayers, blessing: the service lasted nearly an hour before the soldiers sat down to a breakfast of chicken, mashed potato, cakes and sodas.</p><p> \"In the context of the day-to-day military work, this is a spiritual relief, a spiritual uplifting,\" said one soldier, 49-year-old Igor Kotsko.</p><p> \"It also gives you a lot of strength. To keep your morale up, to keep fighting the enemy,\" he added.</p><p> Rostyslav Osushan, the 39-year-old military chaplain, shared the soldiers' meal, seated beside them.</p><p> \"In war, life and death are so close,\" he said. \"And yet you have to see and feel the inner strength, which you can only get from the spirit.\"</p><p> The men were celebrating Easter at a time when Russian forces have been making frontline gains because of the lack of weapons and ammunitions on the Ukrainian side.</p><p> Asked what the troops needed most badly, Osushan replied: \"Ammunition and God.\"</p><p> \"You need ammunition, good weapons, and you also need to have a strong inner resilience,\" he added. \"It's psychology, and you also need to have spiritual power. So you need both.\"</p><p> Just a few dozen kilometres away to the south, a small village next to the front line serves as the base for the 59th mechanised brigade.</p><p> This time, it is a visiting chaplain who comes by to celebrate Easter with a handful of the unit's soldiers gathered in front of a house.</p><p> \"It's a chance for my guys to relax, those who are here,\" said Mykola Panyshenko, the group's 45-year-old commander. \"For whether you're in the trenches or here, you have to get your job done at all times.\"</p><p> Panyshenko, who has led the brigade, which has been in position here since November 2022, did not join his men for the service.</p><p> \"You know, if there was a lot of God here, there wouldn't be so many deaths,\" he said. \"And there are a lot of deaths here. There is a lot of pain and suffering.</p><p> \"I understand that God protects Ukraine, because Ukraine is still holding on. The whole world is helping Ukraine. But here, at the front, in these trenches, there is certainly a lot more death than God,\" Panyshenko added.</p><p> On the horizon, plumes of dark smoke rose up into the blue sky, as the sound of artillery and heavy explosions carried across to the house, not far away.</p>",
