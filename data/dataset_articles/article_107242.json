  "text": "Chhindwara (MP), May 6: The mortal remains of an Indian Air Force soldier, Corporal Vikky Pahade who succumbed to injuries sustained in a terror attack on Saturday evening, arrived in his hometown in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhindwara for last rites on Monday. [Follow the Daily Excelsior channel on WhatsApp ](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaPGPCzCXC3QBmvNcH0t) Pahade lost his life in the Poonch Sector of Jammu and Kashmir after an Indian Air Force vehicle convoy was attacked by terrorists on Saturday, May 4. The IAF soldier’s sister, Geeta Pahade, who is a sub-inspector, said she learned about the incident on Saturday night and was proud of her brother. “I am proud of my brother. I got to know about this (brother’s demise) a day before yesterday. I want justice for my brother,” Pahade added. Brother-in-law of Pahade, Sanju Gaunekar said, “We came to know about the matter on Saturday evening. We received a message at around 6:30 pm that Pahade suffered a bullet injury and was hospitalised in Udhampur. Later, we were informed at around 7:30 pm that he succumbed to injuries.” “We are proud of him, but it is a tragedy for the family as he was the lone son in the family and had three sisters. His father also passed away earlier,” he added. Pahade had left behind his five-year-old son, wife, mother and sisters. (Agencies)",
