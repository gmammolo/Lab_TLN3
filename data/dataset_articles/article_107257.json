  "text": "Vietnam veteran reunited with dog tag he lost nearly 60 years ago LAKE CITY, S.C. (WPDE) - A Vietnam veteran from South Carolina has been reunited with his dog tag that he lost decades ago, thanks to a treasure hunter and the power of social media. Larry Morganti is still stunned the dog tag he lost in a rocket attack nearly 60 years ago is back in his possession. He was the crew chief on a C-123 cargo plane during the Vietnam War as part of the 311th Squadron of the Air Force from October 1967 to October 1968. Morganti recalled that while serving, he once heard a loud bomb and began running for his life. Somewhere in the chaos, he lost his dog tags and later went to his first sergeant for a new pair, thinking little of it. It hadn’t really crossed his mind where the originals might be until a Swedish construction worker named Kristoffer Hansen made contact with him. Hansen saw Morganti’s artwork on a Facebook post for The Vault, a shop that holds works by an array of vendors, and realized he’d been searching for the man for two years. He reached out to store manager Debrah Lane for help contacting Morganti. Hansen said he found one of the veteran’s dog tags with a metal detector. At first, Lane was skeptical of the claim, wary of scammers and hackers, but she says she knew it was real when Hansen provided Morganti’s personal information, such as when and where he served. “I thought, ‘What a wonderful moment that this guy felt the need to return these tags to their original owner’ and the fact that he cared enough to do it,” Lane said. “And the fact that Mr. Larry is still alive is fabulous to me. I just thought that it was the best story that we, as Americans, can hear today.” During an art event where Morganti was being honored, Lane shared the incredible news about his dog tag, bringing chills and tears of joy to all. Morganti himself says he’s still in shock. “It was real surprising. In fact, for a second, I didn’t believe it. It’s such a far-fetched idea to find tags 56 years old and then another two years to bring them to me. He searched, I’m sure, long and hard to find them,” Morganti said. Lane says it was a gift from God that she was able to bridge that gap and make this phenomenal connection. Hansen sent the dog tag to Morganti, along with a letter thanking him for his service, in late April. Copyright 2024 WPDE via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.",
