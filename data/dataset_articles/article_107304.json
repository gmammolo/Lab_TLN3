  "text": "Denys Shmyhal, Prime Minister of Ukraine (Vitalii Nosach, RBC-Ukraine) Ukraine is banking on NATO members to make a decision regarding its membership bid at the upcoming summit in Washington, scheduled for July, according to Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. “Our army works according to the NATO standards,” he said. At the same time, the Prime Minister mentioned that Kyiv has “implemented all needed reforms, and now we are a step before invitation.” Ukraine’s NATO assession Ukraine officially applied for NATO membership in September 2022, seven months after Russia’s invasion. However, the application emphasized Kyiv’s desire for an accelerated accession process without the so-called NATO Membership Action Plan. Recently, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy mentioned that Kyiv is already preparing for the future summit of the North Atlantic Alliance. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna has said that Washington and Berlin are opposed to extending an official invitation to Kyiv to join the alliance.",
