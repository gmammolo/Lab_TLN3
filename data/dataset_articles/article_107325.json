  "text": "PM Modi’s guidance to Putin, Ukraine has prevented World War III: Kangana Ranaut Kangana Ranaut, the BJP candidate from the Mandi Lok Sabha seat, said everyone, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the people in Ukraine, sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's guidance. Listen to Story In Short - Kangana Ranaut credits PM Modi for preventing World War 3 - She says PM openly advocates for world peace - Ranaut to file nomination for Mandi Lok Sabha seat on May 14 Actor-turned-politician Kangana Ranaut said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's guidance to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine helped prevent World War III. Addressing a recent election rally, the BJP candidate said, \"Starting from Putin to the people of Ukraine, they keep looking up to him (PM Modi) to provide them with their guidance. And because of this, perhaps it is why the Third World War is not happening today.\" \"He (Prime Minister) speaks openly in favour of peace in the world. We have never seen the image of India that we have today. Do we still need to think who should we vote for?\" she queried. Ranaut is slated to file her nomination papers from the [Mandi Lok Sabha seat](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kangana-ranaut-post-bjp-names-her-mandi-candidate-lok-sabha-polls-2519026-2024-03-24) in Himachal Pradesh on May 14. She has been pitted against Congress's Vikramaditya Singh, Himachal Pradesh's Public Works Minister and a scion of the erstwhile Rampur estate. The Congress candidate, who is the son of six-time Chief Minister late Virbhadra Singh and state party chief Pratibha Singh, will file his nomination papers on Thursday. Elections to the four Lok Sabha seats in the hill state -- Mandi, Shimla, Kangra and Hamirpur -- will take place on June 1, the seventh and last phase of the national polls.",
