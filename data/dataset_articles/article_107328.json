  "text": "Pakistan's Satellite Mission ICUBE-Qamar Milestone In Space Tech Development: Gul\nFaizan Hashmi\nPublished May 06, 2024 | 06:38 PM\nChairman Tehreek-e-Jawanaan Pakistan (TJP), Mohammad Abdullah Gul on Monday termed Pakistan's first satellite mission on the moon \"ICUBE-Qamar\" as a milestone in the country's space technology development\nISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th May, 2024) Chairman Tehreek-e-Jawanaan\nPakistan (TJP), Mohammad Abdullah Gul on Monday termed https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html's first satellite mission on the moon \"ICUBE-Qamar\" as a milestone in the country's space technology development.\nIn a statement issued here, the TJP chairman quoted the verses of Dr\nAllama Muhammad Iqbal stating that the motherland bears great potential if channelised properly and the country's satellite mission was positive development in that regard.\nGul said that Institute of Space\nTechnology (IST) students, teachers and https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) deserved felicitations on the occasion. \"This proved that if given good opportunities, Pakistanis are second to none in modern science and technology. The only way out to end economic depression is to provide favorable environment and opportunities to youth in IT and other modern technologies.\nWe pray to Allah to make this satellite mission a success,\" he added.\nHe said that since it was the first satellite that was sent to the\nmoon that would provide the advantage that if https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html succeed in landing on the moon in the future, it would need to seek no help from any space agency to communicate with its own space vehicles.\n\"This is the first milestone that we will achieve with the help of\nChina. This satellite will inform us about the situation there. This is no ordinary mission. It will help to observe the environment, and provide remote sensing, and communication facilities,\" he said.\nHe reminded in\nIndia that https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/pakistan.html's space program was much older than Indian programme and the latter achieved success through its own limited resources.\nRecent Stories\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/pakistans-progress-on-tobacco-taxation-still-1822126.html\"> 12 minutes ago\n</a>\nPakistan's progress on tobacco taxation still falls short of WHO guidelines\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/man-involved-in-supplying-narcotics-to-studen-1822117.html\"> 20 minutes ago\n</a>\nMan involved in supplying narcotics to students held with 1.48kg hashish\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/britains-king-charles-iii-marks-first-annive-1822116.html\nBritain's King Charles III marks first anniversary of coronation\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/bilawal-constitutes-committee-to-engage-with-1822115.html\"> 19 minutes ago\n</a>\nBilawal constitutes committee to engage with Govt over privatization issue\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/crackdown-against-power-thieves-intensified-i-1822114.html\nCrackdown against power thieves intensified in Dera\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/federal-ombudsman-regional-office-holds-open-1822113.html\"> 18 minutes ago\n</a>\nFederal Ombudsman' regional office holds open court at Paroa Tehsil\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/simplification-of-tax-collection-better-liai-1822112.html\nSimplification of tax collection, better liaison between businessmen-tax officia ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/french-ambassador-lauds-pakistans-role-in-re-1822110.html\nFrench Ambassador lauds Pakistan's role in regional stability\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/barrister-naseem-bajwas-book-europe-ki-di-1822109.html\"> 30 minutes ago\n</a>\nBarrister Naseem Bajwa’s Book \"Europe Ki Diary\" rekindles passion for national ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/president-zardari-arrives-in-quetta-1822108.html\nPresident Zardari arrives in Quetta\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/dr-azra-fazal-pechuho-visits-hm-khawaja-libra-1822107.html\nDr Azra Fazal Pechuho visits HM Khawaja Library\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/nayyar-bukhari-stresses-for-unity-among-all-p-1822106.html\nNayyar Bukhari stresses for unity among all political parties to steer country o ..\nMore Stories From Pakistan\n-\nMan involved in supplying narcotics to students held with 1.48kg hashish20 minutes ago\n-\nBilawal constitutes committee to engage with Govt over privatization issue19 minutes ago\n-\nCrackdown against power thieves intensified in Dera20 minutes ago\n-\nFederal Ombudsman' regional office holds open court at Paroa Tehsil18 minutes ago\n-\nSimplification of tax collection, better liaison between businessmen-tax officials stressed20 minutes ago\n-\nFrench Ambassador lauds Pakistan's role in regional stability20 minutes ago\n-\nBarrister Naseem Bajwa’s Book \"Europe Ki Diary\" rekindles passion for national building30 minutes ago\n-\nPresident Zardari arrives in Quetta30 minutes ago\n-\nDr Azra Fazal Pechuho visits HM Khawaja Library30 minutes ago\n-\nNayyar Bukhari stresses for unity among all political parties to steer country out of challenges30 minutes ago\n-\nTruck driver looted after failed encounter29 minutes ago\n-\nA.D Pirzada stresses education and training for visually impaired children29 minutes ago",
