He outlined ongoing endeavours to bolster professional training, equip officers with modern weapons, and augment manpower for effective policing.\nSSP\nPolice said there is also a need to raise Security Divisions for countering hardcore militants. The majority of Police force is recruited to perform duty at Police stations and have fewer capabilities of fighting with hardened criminals who are also equipped with modern weapons.\nKashir said the morale of the\nPolice force is very high who performed duty day and night amid heightened threats of attacks from militants, especially in suburban areas.\nWith the courage of the\npolice force and the adoption of new strategies, militant attacks are now on hold, he claimed.\nSSP Operations, Kashif Zulfiqar also emphasized the crucial need for the 'Safe City Project' in\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/peshawar.html, highlighting its important role in combating various forms of crime.\nHe said the project is delayed and it's not too late to initiate at this stage by launching a pilot project for ensuring security in the city.\nKashif clarified any misunderstandings surrounding the use of\nsocial media by police personnel, highlighting the significance of upholding departmental standards and ensuring a cohesive approach to official communications.\nHe stressed the necessity for officers to adhere to established protocols when engaging with\nsocial media platforms, emphasizing the importance of maintaining professionalism and avoiding any actions that could undermine the integrity of the police force.\nDetailing efforts to combat crime, Kashif elaborated on the 'Security Plan' for the upcoming Muharram-ul-Haram 1446 AH, with a focus on thwarting terrorism and communal biases. He called for collaborative efforts\nfrom all stakeholders to facilitate law enforcement and restore exemplary law and order in https://www.urdupoint.com/en/latest-news/peshawar.html.\nIn response to a question about taking action for the prevention of cruelty against animals, he said the\nPolice are taking action against those involved in fighting different birds including cock, quail, partridge and animals like dogs or bulls.\nRecent Stories\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/world-bank-delegation-calls-on-shaza-fatima-1822166.html\"> 3 minutes ago\n</a>\nWorld Bank delegation calls on Shaza Fatima\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/dc-for-implementation-of-roti-naans-revised-1822165.html\nDC for implementation of Roti, Naan's revised rates\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/hujra-culture-still-alive-in-kp-despite-mushr-1822164.html\nHujra culture still alive in KP despite mushroom growth of social media\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/sindh-university-laar-campus-hosts-sports-gal-1822163.html\nSindh University Laar Campus Hosts Sports Gala 2024\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/ukraines-soldiers-mark-easter-on-the-front-l-1822162.html\"> 7 minutes ago\n</a>\nUkraine's soldiers mark Easter on the front line\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/peshawar-rawalpindi-karachi-win-matches-in-1822161.html\"> 8 minutes ago\n</a>\nPeshawar, Rawalpindi, Karachi win matches in 9th round of National Women’s Tou ..\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/sports/lesco-wins-inter-unit-wapda-kabaddi-champions-1822160.html\nLESCO wins Inter-Unit WAPDA Kabaddi Championship\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/wafaqi-mohtsibs-inspection-team-visits-itp-1822159.html\nWafaqi Mohtsib,s Inspection team visits ITP\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/empowering-commuters-zindigi-sindh-govt-m-1822158.html\"> 22 minutes ago\n</a>\n\"Empowering Commuters: Zindigi, Sindh Govt, Mastercard, & People Bus Service Fir ..\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/business/stocks-rise-on-renewed-hopes-of-rate-cuts-1822157.html\"> 21 minutes ago\n</a>\nStocks rise on renewed hopes of rate cuts\n<a href=\"https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/russia-threatens-strikes-on-uk-military-targe-1822156.html\"> 20 minutes ago\n</a>\nRussia threatens strikes on UK military targets in Ukraine 'and beyond'\nhttps://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/anf-recovers-338-kg-drugs-in-nine-operations-1822155.html\nANF recovers 338 kg drugs in nine operations\nMore Stories From Pakistan\n-\nDC for implementation of Roti, Naan's revised rates3 minutes ago\n-\nHujra culture still alive in KP despite mushroom growth of social media3 minutes ago\n-\nSindh University Laar Campus Hosts Sports Gala 20243 minutes ago\n-\nWafaqi Mohtsib,s Inspection team visits ITP8 minutes ago\n-\nANF recovers 338 kg drugs in nine operations20 minutes ago\n-\nAleem Khan reviews Skardu-Gilgit highway situation after landslide11 minutes ago\n-\nMashal Initiative Institute holds function to encourage IDD students11 minutes ago\n-\nArt, craft training classes begin at Qasr-e-Behbood11 minutes ago\n-\nK-Electric delegation meets DG KDA5 minutes ago\n-\nDC reviews arrangements for annual Urs of Shah Karim Bulri5 minutes ago\n-\nCTD busts inter-provincial arms syndicate, four key operatives arrested5 minutes ago\n-\nAnti polio drive culminates, 99.04% target achieved: DC5 minutes ago",
