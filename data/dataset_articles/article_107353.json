  "text": "After five days, Vassar College students took down their encampment on the campus library lawn Saturday, following approximately 13 hours of deliberation with Vassar administration. On Tuesday, April 30, Vassar College students had joined protests happening across the state and nation surrounding the Israel-Hamas war. Some protests locally have led to arrests, including at the campuses of SUNY New Paltz and SUNY Purchase . Vassar Students for Justice in Palestine announced in an Instagram post they would end their encampment through an agreement reached with Vassar administration regarding their demands, but said \"we do not recognize this agreement as a victory.\" The student group said the agreement gives them support \"in pursuing a plan for divestment from weapons and surveillance manufacturers, including those that supply Israel with the materials that carry out the genocide of the Palestinian people.\" The agreement includes an invitation for students to present at an upcoming Trustee Investor Responsibility Committee meeting and the establishment of a group of faculty and students to propose \"curricular innovations around the topics of Peace and Conflict Studies and/or Middle Eastern Studies.\" Both students and administration plan to meet and continue communications to maintain effective working relationships. More: Did SUNY Purchase, New Paltz protest arrests violate free speech protections? In a letter posted on Vassar's website, Vassar President Elizabeth H. Bradley said the college \"will work to improve our understanding, dialogue about, and educational programming concerning peace and conflict, with focus on Gaza and the Middle East.\" Through the encampment, Vassar students said they received $7,000 dollars and supplies to support their efforts. \"We are able to donate all the money we raised directly to families in Gaza and all the supplies will be redistributed to organizations and people in Poughkeepsie,\" students said in an Instagram post. The Vassar campus community, Bradley said, recognizes the growing racism that affects students' experiences and \"is committed to combating all these forms of hatred\" while working toward healing.",
