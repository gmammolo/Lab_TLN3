  "text": "Hamas says it has agreed to ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar (CNN) — Hamas says it has accepted the ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar which seeks to halt the seven-month war with Israel in Gaza . In a statement Monday, Hamas said the head of its political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, told the Qatari Prime Minister and Egyptian intelligence minister that the militant group had accepted their proposal. CNN has asked the Israeli Prime Minister’s office for comment. The latest framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners. After the initial exchange, there will follow what sources describe as the “restoration of sustainable calm” during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners. Hamas’ acceptance of the deal comes just hours after Israel ordered Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to “evacuate immediately.” The order raised fears that Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of the north of Gaza. A source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree to a deal that would bring about the ceasefire-for-hostages deal.
