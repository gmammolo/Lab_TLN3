  "text": "Jordan King Abdullah II warned that an Israeli assault on Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge, threatens to lead to a new massacre, according to a statement posted on social media by the Royal Hashemite Court. Abdullah met on Monday with President Joe Biden, where the two leaders affirmed their commitment to working to reach a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, the royal court said. Jordan is a key U.S. ally in the region. Last month, the Jordanian air force shot down dozens of Iranian drones headed for Israel as Tehran launched a massive revenge attack on its arch-enemy. The White House wasn t as publicly explicit in its concerns over the potential civilian toll of a Rafah operation. Earlier this year, Biden said it would be catastrophic. On Monday the White House would only say: The President reiterated his clear position on Rafah during a phone call with Netanyahu. “Israel s order for around 100,000 Palestinians in Gaza to evacuate ahead of an offensive in Rafah puts every single Palestinian in Gaza in grave danger, the humanitarian group Oxfam said in a statement −Dan Morrison",
