  "text": "PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES: Hamas says it is considering in a \"positive spirit\" a Gaza truce deal, while the UN warned rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory would require efforts not seen since World War II.\nAfter months of stop-start negotiations, Hamas has sounded an optimistic tone about the latest hostages-for-ceasefire proposal, raising hopes an agreement may soon be reached -- even as medics in the besieged strip reported fresh strikes on Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah on Friday.\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said the group will \"soon\" send a delegation to Egypt to complete ongoing ceasefire discussions with a deal that \"realises the demands of our people\".\nHaniyeh, the leader of the militant group's political wing, told Egyptian and Qatari mediators in calls on Thursday that Hamas was studying the latest proposal from Israel with a \"positive spirit\".\nThe stakes of the truce talks were thrown into sharp relief Thursday, when a UN report estimated it could take 80 years to reconstruct all the homes flattened over the course of the nearly seven-month war.",
