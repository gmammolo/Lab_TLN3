  "text": "MARSHALL COUNTY, W.Va. — Denzel Ray Butler is a West Virginia native who raised his family in Marshall County. He is a World War II veteran who is about to celebrate turning 101 years old. On May 23, 1923, Butler was born in Gilmer County. He moved to Moundsville as a teenager, where he met his wife on Jefferson Avenue as she was coming out of a movie theater. At the age of 19, Butler received a draft notice and served in the Army Air Corps in New Guinea and Australia. “I can’t really explain it to you. You kind of have to have that experience to really know what it’s like,” Butler said. He worked in and on planes, as well as on vehicles, large and small, and recounts a time when he flew in a bomber plane with no bombs inside. He says that although some veterans may struggle with PTSD after a war, he has never had that experience. “I didn't play on it after the war. I don't dream about it, I've never had one nightmare about being in New Guniea or Australia. Not one,” Butler said. When he left for New Guinea, he was gone for 3 years and didn't see his 3-year-old daughter until he returned. After retiring from the Army Air Corps, he worked as a barber in Moundsville for nearly 70 years. He currently lives with his son, Vic Butler, who also served in the military as a Vietnam vet and worked in the Navy. Vic says he looks up to his father. “That's pretty much my goal. I just wanted to be like my dad so at his age right now he'll be 101 on the 23rd this month,” said Vic. “I'm proud of him, proud of the service he's done, the way he lived his life and took care of his family.” Butler also knows that it's rare to see any vet who was drafted at 19. “Well it would be something if I happened to be the oldest one in the county but I don't think that’s going to happen,\" Butler said. He says it's important to support the military more than we do, but ultimately, he is happy to be one of the soldiers who returned home after World War II. “I'm just glad it's over, and I'm glad I’m one of the fortunate ones to get back to my family,'\" Butler said. Butler now enjoys going to church on Sundays with his son.",
