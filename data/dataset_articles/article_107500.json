  "title": "Despite war, Gross Schechter eighth graders head to Israel",
  "text": "School trips to Israel are memorable in many ways, but for the eighth-grade class at Gross Schechter Day School in Pepper Pike, this year’s trip promises to be like no other. That’s because many schools across the country canceled their annual trips due to the Israel-Hamas war. As the students prepared to depart from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on May 5 for a three-week stay in Eretz Yisrael, the school marked the trip with an 8th Grade Nesiyah Tova, which means “have a good trip; bon voyage,” on May 3 at the school. As the eighth-grade class sat on stage, students heard remarks from Head of School Ginny Galili; board president Erica Lazzaro; Randy Boroff, director of academics; Rabbi Ben Shlimovitz, middle school Judaic studies teacher/coordinator of Jewish living; and Sheri Gross, director of creative programming. Director of Judaic studies Elana Perlin offered a d’var Torah before the eighth graders received presentations from the other grades and sweatshirts for their trip. Rabbi Scott Roland of Congregation Shaarey Tikvah in Beachwood offered a tefillat haderekh and birkat kohanim as the travelers huddled under a tallit. “It’s extremely important that Gross Schechter Day School’s eighth-grade class goes to Israel because annually this is the capstone event of the Gross Schechter student’s journey from early childhood to middle school,” Galili told the Cleveland Jewish News. “Before they graduate to high school, it’s extremely important they strengthen their relationship with Israel and Israeli people, that they grow in their understanding of Israel and in their understanding of the complexities that Israel and the Israeli people face.” Galili said unlike previous trips, these students will perform more volunteer work in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, surprise attack by Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw 250 people taken hostage, and lead into the war, which is now in its seventh month. The students will “increase the amount of volunteerism and service that the eighth graders will engage in alongside their Israeli brothers and sisters,” Galili said. ”It will have even more of a mission, a theme of solidarity with Israel and the Israeli people. ...” The students visiting Israel are Isabella Bodzin, Dalia Epstein, Shay-Lee Hameiri, Lyla Levin, Avery Milota and Miriam Shapiro, who are joined by chaperones Lauren Henkin, middle school coordinator and language arts teacher, and Binyamin Kleinman, middle school Judaics teacher. For “the eighth graders who are going to Israel, this year is an extremely meaningful trip,” Lazzaro told the CJN. “To have Gross Schechter as the only Jewish day school in Cleveland sending a class of eighth graders really shows as a testament to how important Israel is to our curriculum and to our students and to our parents.”",
