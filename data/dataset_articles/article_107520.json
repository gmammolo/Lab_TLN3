  "text": "The United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO) today awarded its World Press Freedom Award to all Palestinian journalists covering the war in the Gaza Strip since the start of the conflict between Israeli forces and the Palestinian movement Hamas on October 7. \"In these times of darkness and turmoil, we want to send a strong message of solidarity and recognition to Palestinian journalists who are covering this crisis in dramatic circumstances,\" said Mauricio Weibel, president of the International Jury of Media Professionals. According to him, humanity owes a huge debt to Palestinian journalists for their courage and commitment to freedom of expression. UNESCO Director General Odre Azule emphasized \"the importance of collective mobilization so that journalists, everywhere in the world, can continue to carry out their essential work of information and research\". According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based organization, 7 journalists and media workers, 97 of them Palestinian, have been killed and 92 injured since the war began on October 16 between Israel and Hamas.
