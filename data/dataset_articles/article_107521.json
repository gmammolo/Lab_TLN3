We no longer think of conflict or hatred. It's good to shake hands as we all want more friends and less enemies,\" Duong said.\n- 'Deaths were normal' -\nFrench Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu examines a map of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam ahead of commemorations for the battle's 70th anniversary / © AFP\nFrance surrendered to Viet Minh attacks on May 7, 1954, putting an end to 56 days of shelling and hand-to-hand combat.\nAround 13,000 people were reported dead or missing during the conflict, including 10,000 from the Viet Minh side.\n\"I fired a shot which hit two people, killing one on the spot and the other one with one more shot,\" recalled veteran infantry soldier Hoang Van Bay, 93.\n\"Injuries and deaths were normal in the battlefield, nothing to be scared of. We fought for our independence and freedom,\" Bay told AFP, adding he visited his fallen comrades at Dien Bien Phu city's cemetery every year.\nThe French expeditionary force -- with some 15,000 men of many nationalities -- had underestimated the firepower of the communist forces, who managed to install cannon on the hills overlooking the French camp.\nThe Viet Minh had transported them in pieces hundreds of kilometres through the jungle, sometimes by bicycle.\nTheir victory later led to the Geneva Accords on July 21, 1954, which marked the end of almost a century of French domination in Indochina and the partition of Vietnam, a prelude to future American involvement.\nRelations between the two former enemies are now cordial, despite the human rights abuses of which the communist government is regularly accused.\n- 'More openness' -\nThe tree-lined streets of Dien Bien Phu were adorned with communist slogans and banners carrying photos of independence hero Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap, commander in chief of the Dien Bien Phu campaign, ahead of the celebrations.\nVisitors walk across a hill lined with trenches before commemorations for the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam / © AFP\nThe city was busy with crowds of tourists and a heavy military and police presence.\nThe province's battle sites are also undergoing a major facelift, with the Vietnamese authorities keen to turn the area into a tourism hotspot.\n\"Twenty years ago, it (the commemoration) was much more discreet. There was a sort of holding back on the Vietnamese side because May 7 is sacred for them,\" said Pierre Journoud, professor of contemporary history at Paul Valery-Montpellier University, who is attending the commemorations.\n\"We are seeing more openness today.\"\nHe said Vietnam's invitation to Lecornu reflects shared political interests, as tensions simmer between Hanoi and Beijing over their competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nAfter the United States and China, \"France wants to be a third voice in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is in line with the position of Vietnam, which is caught between two strangleholds,\" he said.\nPrime Minister Chinh said on Monday the visit was an effort to \"close the past, overcome differences and head towards the future\", in order to promote a strategic relationship between Vietnam and France.\nFrench veterans Jean-Yves Guinard, Andre Mayer and William Schilardi return to visit the site of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam ahead of 70th anniversary commemorations / © AFP\nNinety-two-year-old Jean-Yves Guinard, one of three French veterans who returned to their former camp for the anniversary, told AFP he \"remained very attached to this country\".\nThe three were surrounded as they arrived at the Dien Bien Phu Victory Museum by locals and tourists trying to take selfies with the former \"enemy\".",
