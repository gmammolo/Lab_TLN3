  "text": "Ukrainians who fled to Hungary to avoid being drafted for war are “safe” in Hungary. Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen has said that Budapest will not allow refugees “to be sent to their deaths” via conscription in the war.\nWe all know the rulers start the wars but aren’t the ones who will be fighting them. They have always demanded a blood sacrifice from the slaves. Whether it’s conscription, a draft, or anything else, forcing another human to kill or be killed is the absolute height of enslavement of human beings.\nSemjen told Hungarian broadcaster ATV on Monday that Budapest “would not extradite refugees to Ukraine.” “We do not investigate whether, according to the Ukrainians, the person is conscripted or not. Based on basic humanity, we will not allow them to be sent to their deaths.” It’s difficult to find anyone in the ruling class concerned about humanity and morality, but it’s nice to know those feeling obvious slavery can find at least some relief.\n“Every refugee from Ukraine is completely safe with us and receives all the help,” he added.\nIn an effort to force Ukrainians of fighting age to return home, Ukrainian consulates abroad last month announced the “temporary suspension” of services to men between the ages of 18 and 60, who can no longer receive any necessary documents until they return home. A Washington Post report last week suggested that many Ukrainians living in the West are angered by the new policy, saying they feel they are being treated like traitors and potential prey for conscription officials. – RT\nSlave State Intensifies: Conscription In Ukraine Prompts Fear\nThe idea that anyone is free while ruling classes (governments) of any kind exist is becoming less and less of an illusion every day. Even the most numb statists are figuring out that freedom means no one else has authority or control over you or your property. It’s a slow process, but it’s coming along. The more brutal the masters become the faster people are going to figure it out too. That could be the only good news.",
