Oluchukwu Owowoh, the first female Sandhurst-trained Nigerian Army officer, after she completed her training, describing her as an inspiration to the nation’s youth.\n2nd Lt. Owowoh completed her training from the Royal Military Academy (RMA), Sandhurst, United Kingdom, on the 12th of April, 2024.\nAccording to a statement issued by her spokesperson, Busola Kukoyi, the First Lady, who noted the sterling performances of 24-year-old personnel, said the officer is a good example of the great feats Nigerian youth can achieve.\n“Your determination and resilience are quite remarkable and you are an inspiration to the youth of this country. As a woman, the first who has made a mark in a male-dominated field, I salute you.\n“You have the entire world ahead of you. This is just the beginning. You are now a reference point for all Nigerian Youth. If you remain focused and positive, you will reach your goal in life”, she said.\nFirst Lady Tinubu, in a practical demonstration of celebrating the young officer, requested all present, including the Wife of the Vice President, Wife of the Speaker, wives of ministers, wives of service chiefs, and members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, to give a standing ovation to 2nd Lt Owowoh.\n“I thank the Nigerian Army for giving 2nd Lt Owowoh the opportunity even in this male-dominated field. Thank you”, she said.\nRelated Posts In her remarks, the wife of the Chief of Defence Staff, Mrs Oghogho Musa, pointed out that the training and graduation of Owowoh is a testament to improved female inclusion in the country.\nThe Commandant of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Maj. Gen O.J.Ochai explained that Owowoh was the best of the 200 selected cadets from the NDA.\nHe said the officer excelled in three areas earmarked, which were academics, military subjects, and physical fitness.\nShe received the prestigious Sandhurst Medal after the likes of Sir Winston Churchill, Prince Willams of Wales, and former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon.\nShe has since been assigned to the Nigerian Military Intelligence unit on her return to the country.",
