First pitch from Yankee Stadium is scheduled for 7:05 p.m. ET (TBS). Let's analyze [FanDuel Sportsbook's](https://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_27628b_2436c_&affid=11104&siteid=27628&adid=2436&c=) lines around the Astros vs. Yankeesodds and make our expert [MLB picks and predictions](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/category/mlb-odds-lines-spreads-picks-predictions/) for the best bets. Season series: Yankees lead 4-0 Houston got off to an awful start this season, one jumpstarted by the Astros getting swept at home by New York in a season-opening 4-game set. They had gone 5-1 from April 27-May 3 but then dropped back-to-back games to the Seattle Mariners Saturday and Sunday. The Yankees are coming off a weekend sweep of the Detroit Tigers. Despite some intermittent slumps of late, New York is 6-3 with a plus-19 run differential since April 27. Astros at Yankees projected starters RHP Justin Verlander vs. RHP Luis Gil Verlander (1-0, 2.08 ERA) is tabbed for his 4th start. He has a 1.15 WHIP, 3.6 BB/9 and 6.8 K/9 in 17 1/3 innings. - Last outing: No-decision, 7 IP, 2 ER, 6 H, 3 BB, 2 K in 3-2 loss vs. Cleveland Guardians Wednesday - Career vs. Yankees: 10-9, 3.41 ERA (171 1/3 IP, 65 ER), 160 H, 50 BB, 157 K in 27 starts Gil (2-1, 3.19 ERA) is making his 7th start. He has a 1.19 WHIP, 5.8 BB/9 and 11.6 K/9 in 31 innings. - Last outing: Win, 6 1/3 IP, 0 ER, 2 H, 1 BB, 5 K in 2-0 win at Baltimore Orioles Wednesday - Has never faced Astros before - Has lived dangerously with a low rate of 1st-pitch strikes, which has fed into the high walk rate; a .224 batting average on balls in play has been his salvation Win your fantasy baseball league with BaseballHQ.com.

Lines last updated Monday at 9:25 p.m. ET. - Moneyline: Astros +100 (bet $100 to win $100) | Yankees -118 (bet $118 to win $100) - Run line (RL)/Against the spread (ATS): Astros -1.5 (+162) | Yankees +1.5 (-196) - Over/Under (O/U): 8 (O: -115 | U: -105) Astros at Yankees picks and predictions Prediction Astros 5, Yankees 4 [Moneyline](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/08/betting-101-what-is-a-moneyline-bet-in-sports-betting/) The ASTROS (+100) are 4-1 across their last 5 series lid-lifters; the Yanks are 1-3 in their last 4. Gil's control is too much of an issue to make him a likable play against a good Houston offense that does not strike out much. Dating back to last season, the Astros have lost 7 in a row to New York. All 7 of those games have been in Houston; the Astros took 2 of 3 from the Yankees last time they were in the Bronx (Aug. 4-6). Per ESPN, current New York batters own an aggregate .558 OPS against Verlander. The veteran righty is backed by an Astros relief corps that got a much-needed off day Monday. And figure those bullpens -- a New York strength and Houston weakness on paper -- as being way more even in talent and in analytical production. BACK THE ASTROS (+100). [Run line/Against the spread](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/12/sports-betting-101-betting-the-spread/) Better relative value can be found on the ML: PASS. [Over/Under](https://sportsbookwire.usatoday.com/2019/07/11/betting-101-the-over-under/) The Under went 3-0-1 in the earlier series in Houston. Look for some pushback by the bats in this one. There is some fade-Yankees-pitching lean snowballing with play-the-Astros-offense lean. TAKE THE OVER 8 (-115). Play our free daily [Pick’em Challenge](https://dailyticket.usatoday.com/) and win!
