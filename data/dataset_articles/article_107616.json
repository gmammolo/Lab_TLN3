  "text": "Middle East\nUAE backs Qatari-Egyptian mediation for Gaza cease-fire\nQatari-Egyptian cease-fire proposal accepted by Hamas includes 3-stage truce, Palestinian source tells Anadolu\nANKARA\nThe United Arab Emirates reiterated its support on Monday for mediation efforts by Qatar and Egypt to reach a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.\nEmirati Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan held phone calls with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.\nThe discussions took up developments in Gaza and Qatari and Egyptian endeavors to reach a cease-fire and facilitate an exchange of captives and hostages, the UAE Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nThe top diplomat voiced hope that the Qatari-Egyptian mediation would result in a truce that leads to an end to the war, protecting the Palestinians from further suffering and enhancing security, stability and peace in the region.\nHe also underlined the importance of strengthening the humanitarian response to the needs of Gaza’s population and ensuring the urgent and unhindered delivery of relief and medical aid safely and sustainably.\nHamas said on Monday evening that it has accepted a Qatari-Egyptian proposal for a Gaza cease-fire.\nHamas chief Ismail Haniyeh conveyed his group’s approval of the proposal during phone calls with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, the group added in a statement.\nA Palestinian source told Anadolu that the cease-fire proposal includes a 3-stage truce.\nThe first stage will last 40 days and includes a temporary cessation of military operations and Israeli troop withdrawal to the eastern areas of the Gaza Strip except for the Wadi Gaza area, which separates the territory’s north from its south, the source said.\nAfter the release of all Israeli women held by Hamas, the Israeli army will withdraw from Al-Rasheed coastal road to the east to allow access to humanitarian aid and unhindered return of the displaced to their homes, he added.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Office said the truce offer accepted by Hamas does not meet its key demands.\nIsrael has pounded the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which killed about 1,200 people. More than 34,700 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority of whom have been women and children, and 78,100 others injured, according to Palestinian health authorities.\nNearly seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave’s population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN.\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. An interim ruling in January said it is \"plausible\" that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and ordered Tel Aviv to stop such acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
