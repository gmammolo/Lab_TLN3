  "text": "Booking Holdings, a leading online travel agency, reported a significant beat on Wall Street's first-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, driven by a surge in international travel demand. The company's shares soared by 5.25% after-hours trading, highlighting investor confidence in the travel sector's recovery. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/booking-reports-higher-quarterly-profit-international-travel-demand-2024-05-02/) reported that despite a deceleration in domestic leisure travel within the U.S., robust international travel, particularly to destinations in Asia and the Middle East, has played a critical role in this quarter's success. Key Financial Highlights In a remarkable financial turnaround, Booking Holdings reported gross travel bookings of $43.5 billion, a 10% increase from the previous year. Room nights booked also rose 9%. The company's CFO, Ewout Steenbergen, attributed this growth to strong underlying demand and exceptional European performance. Additionally, the negative impacts of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East were less severe than anticipated. According to [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/booking-beats-room-nights-travel-201033473.html?_fsig=gT6uD9Tu189pWaDfO3.7Eg--%7EA), the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company disclosed a quarterly adjusted profit of $20.39 per share, significantly outperforming analysts' expectations of $14.06 per share based on LSEG data. Total revenue for the quarter was reported at $4.41 billion, up 17% year-over-year, surpassing the expected $4.25 billion. Forward-Looking Statements and Challenges Ahead Despite the current successes, Booking Holdings faces challenges ahead. The company anticipates a slowdown in room-night reservations for the ongoing quarter, influenced by escalating tensions in the Middle East, which could dampen regional tourism. Projected growth rates for room-night bookings are between 4% and 6%, below the analysts' expectation of a 7.4% increase. Similarly, gross travel bookings are anticipated to experience a modest growth of 3% to 5%, missing Wall Street's forecasts for a 7.9% growth rate. With a significant portion of its revenue deriving from non-U.S. travel, Booking Holdings has a notable exposure in Europe and the Middle East compared to its rivals like Expedia Group Inc. The company highlighted that 89% of its total revenue comes from international travel, with the Middle East—comprising countries such as Turkey and Egypt—accounting for approximately 7% of global room nights. Market Implications This earnings report arrives at a pivotal time for the online travel industry, which is navigating the post-pandemic recovery landscape. After several quarters of solid performance, companies like Booking Holdings, Expedia, and Airbnb are cautioning against expectations of continued extreme growth rates, underlining the unpredictability of the current global travel market.
