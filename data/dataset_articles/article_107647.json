I hope that the BJP comes to power with more than 400 seats. I want to appeal to the people of Gujarat to come out and cast their votes,\" he said.\nThe Porbandar Lok Sabha seat is witnessing a contest between Mandaviya and Congress leader Lalit Vasoya.Before getting elected to Rajya Sabha the BJP leader was elected an MLA from the Palitana assembly seat of Bhavnagar in 2002.\nThe Union Minister had made significant outreach during his campaigning venturing into the forests and meeting with members of the Maldharis, a shepherd community often overlooked by mainstream politics.\nA total of 12 candidates are in the fray for the Porbandar Lok Sabha seat and around 17,94,000 voters will decide their fate.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cast his vote at Nishan Higher Secondary School in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.The Congress is in alliance with the AAP in Gujarat, where it will contest from 24 seats, while the AAP will contest in Bhavnagar and Bharuch constituencies.\nTwenty five out of the total of 26 seats in the State is polling in the third phase of the ongoing general elections.In Surat BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal was declared unopposed last week.
