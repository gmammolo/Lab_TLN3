  "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched a new wave of airstrikes on Wednesday against “military targets” in the capital of Iran, including an attack on the headquarters of the Iranian police and also sites where nuclear weapons are being developed.\nPUBLICIDAD\nThe Disciplinary Force of the Islamic Republic of Iran (abbreviated Faraja or NAJA) issued a statement indicating that “several” agents were injured following attacks on “some buildings in the vicinity” of its headquarters, as reported by the IRNA news agency.\nPUBLICIDAD\nConflict between Israel and Iran lasted six days\n“The Air Force is attacking military targets of the Iranian regime in the Tehran area,” the IDF stated in a brief message on their social media account X, without initially specifying the targets attacked on this occasion.\"\nOn the other hand, the Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, has indeed stated on social media that the Israeli Air Force planes “destroyed the Iranian regime’s internal security headquarters”. “We will continue to damage government symbols and attack the ayatollahs’ regime everywhere,” he added.\nFurthermore, according to NBC News, among the 20 sites attacked today in Tehran, there were some sites where, according to Israel, nuclear weapons projects were being developed.\nThe spokesperson for the Israeli Army, Effie Defrin, stated that Israeli forces had attacked “more than 1,100” targets in Iran so far. “We are working systematically to neutralize the Iranian threat in all its aspects,” he said, without any response from Iranian authorities regarding these attacks.\nCyberattack against the Iranian state television\nThe Iranian state television, IRIB, was targeted by cyberattacks during the afternoon. \"If you see interruptions or inappropriate messages on several TV channels, it is due to enemy interference in satellite waves,\" explained a presenter, after the government imposed temporary restrictions on internet access.\nIranian authorities also confirmed an attempt to attack the country’s banking system, which “caused the interruption of services in at least two banks in the country.”",
