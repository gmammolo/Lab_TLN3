  "text": "2 min read\nSpecial forces of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine (GUR) on Wednesday struck a ship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet near Novorossiysk.\n\"On September 10, 2025, in the Black Sea area, special forces of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine tracked down and successfully attacked another expensive military target of the aggressor state of Russia - a ship of the MPSV07 multipurpose vessel project from the enemy Black Sea Fleet,\" GUR said on Telegram on Thursday.\nAs noted, the Russians put this ship into operation in 2015. Its cost is about $60 million. In total, the aggressor has four such ships.\n\"The ship of the MPSV07 project is equipped with diving complexes, remote-controlled devices, a side-scan sonar, and electronic warfare (EW) equipment. It can be used to survey the bottom. The ship's power is about 4 MW,\" the intelligence service said.\nIt is reported that at the time of the attack, the enemy ship was conducting electronic reconnaissance and patrolling the approaches to the Novorossiysk Bay, where the remnants of the enemy Black Sea Fleet are located.\n\"The GUR masters of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine delivered a well-aimed strike with a Ukrainian-made combat drone in the area of ​​the control bridge, where, in particular, the ship's navigation and communication equipment is located. As a result of the strike, the EW equipment of the enemy ship was destroyed, and the ship was put out of action for expensive repairs,\" the GUR said.\nTags:\nMORE ABOUT 13:02 05.07.2025 Borisoglebsk airfield hit – General Staff AD AD",
