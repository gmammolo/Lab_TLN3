  "text": "First Sea Lord General Sir Gwyn Jenkins used his DSEI 2025 speech to set out an ambitious vision for the future of carrier aviation, pledging that uncrewed aircraft will soon sit alongside traditional jets in the Royal Navy’s strike groups. “That is not just for the Navy – but for UK industry as well. We want you to become the world’s leading exporter of autonomous vessels, as well as building the best warships in the world – as we’ve seen with the £10 billion Norway deal,” he told industry leaders.\nHe underlined the urgency of the shift. “Let me be really clear – this is not an aspiration for some distant point in the future. It is a necessity now.”\nUK accelerates plans for drones to boost carrier air wing\nJenkins set a principle to guide the fleet’s transformation: “uncrewed wherever possible; crewed only where necessary.” He said this marked “not just a technological shift – it is a strategic transformation in how we project power, preserve lives, and adapt to the pace of modern warfare.”\nThe First Sea Lord said the Royal Navy would pioneer “Hybrid Airwings by the end of this decade, leading NATO nations in a new way of air warfare from the maritime.” By the time the UK’s Carrier Strike Group sails again to the Indo-Pacific, he predicted, “its Carrier Air Wing will be almost unrecognisable – a fusion of crewed and uncrewed platforms, optimised for speed, survivability, adaptability and combat power.”\nJenkins confirmed that the transition is already under way. “We intend to launch the first jet-powered collaborative platform drone as a concept demonstrator off a Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier as soon as next year,” he announced.",
