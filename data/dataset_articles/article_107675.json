He noted that there remains huge potential for further cooperation, particularly defence links.\nAt their meeting, both sides discussed the global and regional situation and issues of mutual concern. General Phan Van Giang reiterated that Vietnam consistently pursues an independent, self-reliant, peaceful, friendly, cooperative, and development-oriented foreign policy, diversifying and multilateralizing international relations, while maintaining the “four no” defence policy.\nVietnam’s consistent stance is to resolve all disputes and disagreements through peaceful means in accordance with international law, especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS 1982); to uphold regional and international commitments, including the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC); and to support the early conclusion of a substantive, effective, and legally consistent Code of Conduct (COC) in the East Sea.\nMinister Phan Van Giang stated that defence cooperation has been actively promoted in recent years. The defence ministries of both countries have effectively realized agreed cooperation contents and achieved positive results, notably in areas such as high-level delegation exchanges, training, defence industry and military trade, UN peacekeeping, and multilateral cooperation. General Phan Van Giang also appreciated the coordination and efforts of relevant agencies from both sides in operating defence attaché offices in each country.\nRegarding future defence cooperation, based on the Defence Cooperation Agreement signed in July 2025, General Phan Van Giang proposed that both sides coordinate to effectively realize certain initiatives, including maintaining and increasing exchanges of delegations at all levels; enhancing training, defence industry cooperation, and UN peacekeeping; continuing mutual support in regional and international multilateral mechanisms and forums; and exploring cooperation and experience exchange in other areas such as naval and air forces, cybersecurity, non-traditional security response, in military engineering and mine clearance.\nGeneral Phan Van Giang also expressed appreciation to Minister Yasar Guler for sending a delegation led by a Deputy Minister of Defense, along with 11 reputable Turkish defence industry enterprises, to participate in the Vietnam International Defence Exhibition 2024, contributing to the event’s success.

He expressed a desire to continue ramping up cooperation in all fields, with particular emphasis on defence.\nConfident that his visit will contribute to strengthening Vietnam–Turkey relations, Minister Yasar Guler appreciated the proactive cooperation in training, particularly the historic deployment of a Turkish defence officer to Vietnam’s National Defense Academy, and pledged to continue sending officers for Vietnamese language training at the Military Science Academy. He also confirmed Turkey’s readiness to host Vietnamese officers and trainees for professional training programs in Turkey.\nMinister Yasar Guler further hailed the joint efforts of both sides in establishing defense attaché offices as a contribution to enhancing bilateral defence cooperation.\nOn the same day, at the Presidential Palace, State President Luong Cuong received Minister Yasar Guler during his courtesy visit.\nState President Luong Cuong welcomes Turkish Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler At the meeting, the Vietnamese State leader expressed confidence that the visit would contribute to reinforcing the Vietnam–Turkey relationship and bilateral defence cooperation.
