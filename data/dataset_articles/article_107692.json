  "text": "Ukrainian intel disables Russian multipurpose ship worth $60 million near Novorossiysk\nUkraine's Defense Intelligence struck a Russian Black Sea Fleet warship of the MPSV07 project near Novorossiysk, according to its message on Telegram.\nThe vessel is a multipurpose ship that Russia commissioned in 2015 at a cost of about $60 million. Russia has four such ships in total.\nThe MPSV07 is equipped with diving complexes, remotely operated vehicles, side-scan sonar and electronic intelligence tools. It can be used for seabed surveys.\nIntelligence operatives hit the ship with a drone, striking the bridge where navigation and communication equipment is located, the agency said. The strike destroyed the vessel's electronic intelligence gear and left it out of service pending costly repairs.\n- Share:",
