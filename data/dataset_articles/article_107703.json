  "text": "WORLD\nUkrainian forces disable $60 million Russian warship in drone attack VIDEO\nUkrainian forces have tracked and disabled a Russian Black Sea Fleet vessel near Novorossiysk in the Black Sea, according to Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR MO).\nThe operation took place on September 10, when Ukrainian special forces targeted a high-value military asset — an MPSV07-class multifunctional ship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, commissioned in 2015, Caliber.Az reports, citing Ukrainian media.\nThe vessel, one of only four of its kind in the Russian fleet, is valued at approximately $60 million. It is equipped with advanced diving systems, remotely operated vehicles, side-scan sonar, and electronic intelligence-gathering equipment.\nAt the time of the attack, the ship was patrolling and conducting electronic reconnaissance near the bay of Novorossiysk, where the remaining units of the Black Sea Fleet are stationed.\nAccording to Ukrainian intelligence, the strike by a combat drone hit the ship’s command bridge, targeting its navigation and communications systems.\nThe attack reportedly destroyed the electronic intelligence equipment, leaving the vessel inoperative and requiring costly repairs.\nBy Aghakazim Guliyev",
