  "text": "\"A breakthrough deal\". Britain will start producing interceptor drones for Ukraine\nAndrii Vodianyi\nThe UK Ministry of Defense has announced its intention to sign an agreement with Ukraine on the exchange of technological know-how in the production of military drones. British companies are expected to produce thousands of them.\n\"The first joint project will be presented at the DSEI defense exhibition in London on Thursday. It is a new high-tech air defense interceptor drone called Project Octopus. It is planned to be mass-produced in the UK with the aim of producing thousands of drones a month for Ukraine to support it in its fight for freedom against Putin's illegal full-scale invasion,\" the ministry said in a statement on its website.\nThe new interceptor was designed by Ukrainians with the support of British scientists and technicians and has already proven its effectiveness on the battlefield.\nIt successfully counteracts variants of Shahed strike drones used by Russia and costs less than 10% of the cost of the drones it intercepts, according to the report.\n\"Through this breakthrough partnership with Ukraine and our Defence Industrial Strategy, we are launching the UK's defense industry at a new speed. This agreement is the first of its kind. It gives British industry unprecedented access to the latest developments, supports Ukraine in repelling Putin's illegal invasion and proves that the defense industry can be a driver of economic growth,\" said Defense Secretary John Healey.\n- This year, the UK is allocating\na record £4.5 billion for military aid to Ukraine– the largest amount ever. - Last month, the British Defense Secretary announced that the British training program for the Ukrainian military\nwill continue until at least the end of 2026. - In March, the Prime Minister announced a historic £1.6 billion contract to supply Ukraine with\nmore than 5,000 air defense missiles xml-ph-00 In addition, this year London is investing a record £350 million to increase drone production for Ukraine – from 10,000 units in 2024 to 100,000 in 2025.",
