  "text": "A mother and daughter devastated by the ravaging effect of war. Illustration/Handout\nJehovah’s Witnesses have launched a global campaign in the month of September highlighting what they describe as the Bible’s solution to war, with more than nine million members participating in over 200 countries, including Kenya.\nThe month-long effort involves the distribution of a special edition of The Watchtower magazine titled ‘An end to war–– how?’\nThe publication explores why wars persist, how they may be resolved and how individuals can achieve peace despite ongoing conflicts.\n“We live in a time where violent conflicts, even large-scale wars, are surging and the effects of such conflicts are not new to us,” Victor Karoki, spokesperson for Jehovah’s Witnesses in East Africa said.\n“This magazine will help those going through the effects of war and violent conflict as well as those searching for peace in their own lives.”\nThe campaign comes as conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan and the Middle East dominate international headlines.\nKenya, though relatively stable, has neighbours in conflict and often feels the impact of regional insecurity, making the subject of lasting peace timely.\nJehovah’s Witnesses say the message is not political but based on the Bible’s assurance that global peace will come only through God’s Kingdom.\n“While the search for peace seems harder as time goes by and millions wait for government to bring peace, the Bible offers a lasting solution,” Karoki said.\nIn addition to distributing the magazine, congregations will host a special 30-minute Bible talk with the same theme on the weekend of September 28.\nThe discourse will be delivered at Kingdom Halls worldwide, including across Kenya. Attendance is free and no collections are taken.\nThe Watchtower edition is also available for free download on the organisation’s website, jw.org, in more than 1000 languages.\nThe Nigerian online publication gazettengr.com quoted Olusegun Eroyemi, a spokesperson for Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria, as saying, “We believe that this magazine will bring hope not only to the millions of people suffering from the violence that war inflicts but also to anyone who is searching for peace in their life.”\nHe hoped that the campaign would spark reflection in a world where conflict remains widespread.\nJehovah’s Witnesses maintain political neutrality and have long been recognised for their refusal to take part in any conflict.\nLocal congregations in Kenya say the campaign offers reassurance that war will one day come to an end completely, a message they hope resonates with the wider public.",
