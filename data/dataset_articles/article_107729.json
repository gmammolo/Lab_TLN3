  "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistani security forces killed 19 militants in three separate operations in the country’s northwest this week, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said on Thursday.\nTehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which Islamabad calls “khwarij,” an early-Islamic term for rebels who declared other Muslims apostates, has intensified attacks in the region in recent years. Pakistani officials often accuse the TTP and separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army of being backed by India, a charge New Delhi denies.\n“On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” the ISPR said.\n“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” it added.\nAccording to the statement, security forces first launched an intelligence-based operation in the Guluno area of Mohmand district, where 14 militants were killed after an intense exchange of fire.\nA second operation in Datta Khel, North Waziristan, left four militants dead, while another encounter in Bannu district killed one.\nISPR said “sanitization operations” were continuing to eliminate any remaining fighters in these areas, reaffirming that security forces were determined to eradicate militant violence from the country.\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari praised the operations, saying the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s soldiers “continue to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.” He vowed Pakistan would keep pursuing militants “until every last terrorist and their facilitators are brought to justice.”",
