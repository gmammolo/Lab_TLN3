  "text": "Japan has conducted its first successful test-firings of a ship-mounted electromagnetic railgun against a target vessel at sea, a feat that brings it a step closer to becoming the first nation to deploy such a next-generation weapon system.\nThe Ministry of Defense’s Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA) revealed Wednesday that it conducted firing tests from June to early July using the prototype railgun deployed aboard the test ship JS Asuka.\n“It’s the first time that a ship-mounted railgun was successfully fired at a real ship,” ATLA wrote on social media platform X, releasing a total of four images of the trials, which were carried out with support from the Maritime Self-Defense Force.",
