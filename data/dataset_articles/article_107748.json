  "text": "GROTON, Conn. — Petty Officer 1st Class Alex Franklin, a native of Fort Pierce, Florida, serves the U.S. Navy assigned to USS Virginia, homeported at Naval Submarine Base New London.\nAs a submariner, Franklin is part of a small percentage of Navy personnel who serve under the sea to help ensure Americans’ safety.\nFranklin graduated from Morningside Academy in 2018.\nThe skills and values needed to succeed in the Navy are similar to those found in Fort Pierce.\n“The biggest lesson I carry with me is pretty simple: always do your best in whatever you do,” Franklin said. “Always put 100% in, because if you don’t, it’s not worth doing. That’s helped me a lot. I like to think I don’t disappoint often in my job.”\nFranklin joined the Navy six years ago. Today, Franklin serves as an electrician’s mate (nuclear power) aboard USS Virginia, a Virginia-class fast-attack submarine.\n“I joined the Navy because I thought it would be a good opportunity to do something different,” Franklin said. “They were also the first ones to get in contact with me. I took the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and qualified to work in nuclear power. The rest is history.”\nKnown as America’s “Apex Predators,” the Navy’s submarine force operates a large fleet of technologically advanced vessels. These submarines are capable of conducting rapid defensive and offensive operations around the world, in furtherance of U.S. national security. A major component of that maritime security is homeported at Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, known as the “Submarine Capital of the World.”\nThere are three basic types of submarines: fast-attack submarines, ballistic-missile submarines and guided-missile submarines.\nFast-attack submarines are designed to hunt down and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships; strike targets ashore with cruise missiles; carry and deliver Navy SEALs; conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions; and engage in mine warfare. The Virginia-class fast-attack submarine is the most advanced submarine in the world today. It combines stealth and payload capability to meet Combatant Commanders’ demands in this era of strategic competition.\nThe Navy’s ballistic-missile submarines, often referred to as “boomers,” serve as a strategic deterrent by providing an undetectable platform for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. They are designed specifically for stealth, extended patrols and the precise delivery of missiles. The Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines will be the largest, most capable and most advanced submarine produced by the U.S., replacing the current Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarines to ensure continuous sea-based strategic deterrence into the 2080s.\nGuided-missile submarines provide the Navy with unprecedented strike and special operation mission capabilities from a stealthy, clandestine platform. Each guided-missile submarine is capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, plus a complement of heavyweight torpedoes to be fired through four torpedo tubes.\nStrategic deterrence is the nation’s ultimate insurance program, according to Navy officials. As a member of the submarine force, Franklin is part of the rich 125-year history of the U.S. Navy’s most versatile weapons platform, capable of taking the fight to the enemy in the defense of America and its allies.\nThe U.S. Navy is celebrating its 250th birthday this year.\nAccording to Navy officials, “America is a maritime nation and for 250 years, America’s Warfighting Navy has sailed the globe in defense of freedom.”\nWith 90% of global commerce traveling by sea and access to the internet relying on the security of undersea fiber optic cables, Navy officials continue to emphasize that the prosperity of the United States is directly linked to recruiting and retaining talented people from across the rich fabric of America.\nFranklin has many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during military service.\n“I’m most proud of being the leading petty officer of my division,” Franklin said. “Leading the division and working with my guys more in the division allows me to train them to grow as sailors and watchstanders. I’m able to help them in their personal lives as well.”\nFranklin serves a Navy that operates far forward, around the world and around the clock, promoting the nation’s prosperity and security.\n“Serving in the Navy means more to me than getting to work with a group of people here to do a job,” Franklin said. “You become part of the family. We take something like a 300- to 400-foot submarine and make it feel like a home.”\nFranklin is grateful to others for helping make a Navy career possible.\n“I want to thank my dad, Kevin Franklin, my first chief, Chief Kyle Martinez, and Senior Chief Machinist’s Mate (Nuclear) Gregory Osborn,” Franklin said. “Chief Martinez and Senior Chief Osborn taught me how to do my job and do it well. My dad taught me the basics of how to work, how to be responsible, have ethics and morals, and how to be successful in whatever I do.”",
