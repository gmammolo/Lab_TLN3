  "text": "The long-scheduled meeting between Secretary General Franco Dal Mas, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Andrii Sybiha, took place today in Rome, on the eve of the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC 2025).\nDuring the cordial talks, Dal Mas reiterated the CEI’s unwavering and steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine, stressing the importance of an inclusive and sustainable recovery rooted in European principles of solidarity and cooperation. He also reaffirmed the CEI’s determination to further strengthen its support to the Ukrainian authorities through concrete initiatives in the areas of territorial development, capacity building, and know-how transfer.\n“Today more than ever, we stand by Ukraine, ready to step up our contribution for its recovery and its European future, promoting a more united, inclusive and resilient Europe,” stated CEI Secretary General Franco Dal Mas.\nAmong the most effective tools used to support Ukraine, Dal Mas highlighted the strategic role of the CEI Fund at the EBRD, financed by Italy.\nThe Fund has contributed to the restoration of the country’s energy infrastructure, notably through support to the state-owned electricity transmission system operator, Ukrenergo. It has also promoted sustainable mobility by enhancing the redevelopment of the public transport system in the city of Ternopil, whose financing agreement, via the EBRD, is scheduled to be signed during the Conference.\nThe CEI is also working with the EBRD to finance additional projects in Ukraine in 2025, particularly in the energy sector (energy security and renewables); and to foster a more investment-friendly environment.\nMinister Sybiha expressed his appreciation for the support provided by the CEI since the onset of the Russian aggression, acknowledging its role as a strategic regional platform for Ukraine’s European integration. He thanked the Secretary General for his leadership of the CEI and for the tangible cooperation projects implemented by the CEI through the EBRD. The Minister also extended an invitation to the Secretary General to pay an official visit to Ukraine.\nThe CEI’s participation in the Conference, which opens tomorrow morning, includes a series of institutional meetings and activities during the two-day URC25 event. Secretary General Dal Mas will speak on 11 July in the panel “Local and Regional Dimension: International Partnerships in Reconstruction – A Step Towards Europe”, dedicated to the role of local and regional authorities and the value of international partnerships, reaffirming the Organisation’s commitment to actively contribute to the country’s recovery.\nFor more info: arsova@cei.int",
