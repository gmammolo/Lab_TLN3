  "text": "Silver Creek native defends America from under the sea\nGROTON, Conn. – Petty Officer 2nd Class Xyon Wolverton, a native of Silver Creek, serves the U.S. Navy assigned to USS Virginia at Naval Submarine Base New London.\nAs a submariner, Wolverton is part of a small percentage of Navy personnel who serve under the sea to help ensure Americans’ safety.\nWolverton graduated from Silver Creek High School in 2021.\nThe skills and values needed to succeed in the Navy are similar to those found in Silver Creek.\n“I learned a good work ethic growing up working on mechanical projects,” Wolverton said. “With my job, my skills correlated to the progression of my work, which is helping me succeed. My traits are allowing me to be noticed for my good work amongst my peers and supervisors.”\nWolverton joined the Navy four years ago. Today, Wolverton serves as a machinist’s mate (non-nuclear, submarine auxiliary) aboard USS Virginia, a fast-attack submarine.\n“I joined the Navy to look for a steady and honorable job,” Wolverton said.\nKnown as America’s “Apex Predators,” the Navy’s submarine force operates a large fleet of technologically advanced vessels. These submarines are capable of conducting rapid defensive and offensive operations around the world, in furtherance of U.S. national security. A major component of that maritime security is homeported at Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, known as the “Submarine Capital of the World.”\nThere are three basic types of submarines: fast-attack submarines, ballistic-missile submarines and guided-missile submarines.\nFast-attack submarines are designed to hunt down and destroy enemy submarines and surface ships; strike targets ashore with cruise missiles; carry and deliver Navy SEALs; conduct intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions; and engage in mine warfare. The Virginia-class fast-attack submarine is the most advanced submarine in the world today. It combines stealth and payload capability to meet Combatant Commanders’ demands in this era of strategic competition.\nThe Navy’s ballistic-missile submarines, often referred to as “boomers,” serve as a strategic deterrent by providing an undetectable platform for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. They are designed specifically for stealth, extended patrols and the precise delivery of missiles. The Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines will be the largest, most capable and most advanced submarine produced by the U.S., replacing the current Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarines to ensure continuous sea-based strategic deterrence into the 2080s.\nGuided-missile submarines provide the Navy with unprecedented strike and special operation mission capabilities from a stealthy, clandestine platform. Each guided-missile submarine is capable of carrying 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles, plus a complement of heavyweight torpedoes to be fired through four torpedo tubes.\nStrategic deterrence is the nation’s ultimate insurance program, according to Navy officials. As a member of the submarine force, Wolverton is part of the rich 125-year history of the U.S. Navy’s most versatile weapons platform, capable of taking the fight to the enemy in the defense of America and its allies.\nThe U.S. Navy is celebrating its 250th birthday this year.\nAccording to Navy officials, “America is a maritime nation and for 250 years, America’s Warfighting Navy has sailed the globe in defense of freedom.”\nWith 90% of global commerce traveling by sea and access to the internet relying on the security of undersea fiber optic cables, Navy officials continue to emphasize that the prosperity of the United States is directly linked to recruiting and retaining talented people from across the rich fabric of America.\nWolverton has many opportunities to achieve accomplishments during military service.\n“I’m most proud of receiving my ‘fish,’ or submarine warfare device,” Wolverton said. “I worked and studied long days and nights for this qualification, so this accomplishment is something that I am very proud to wear on my uniform every day.”\nWolverton serves a Navy that operates far forward, around the world and around the clock, promoting the nation’s prosperity and security.\n“Serving in the Navy makes my family proud, and it’s setting myself up for a future outside of the Navy,” Wolverton said.\nWolverton is grateful to others for helping make a Navy career possible.\n“I would like to thank my father, Steven Leone, my siblings, and my wife and children, for all their love and support,” Wolverton added.",
