  "text": "The highest leaders of Kosovo's institutions paid homage on Thursday in memory of the victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States of America.\nPresident Vjosa Osmani, acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti, and Speaker of Parliament Dimal Basha laid wreaths of flowers near the memorial plaque located in the courtyard of the Kosovo Government, near the Parliament.\nThe September 11 attacks have been described as one of the most tragic events in modern American history. Four passenger planes were hijacked by members of the terrorist organization Al-Qaeda: two of them crashed into the Twin Towers in New York, one into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania after passengers attempted to repel the hijackers.\nToday's tributes, in addition to honoring the over 3 victims of that tragic day, as Kurti declared, are an expression of the gratitude and solidarity of the people of Kosovo with the United States.",
