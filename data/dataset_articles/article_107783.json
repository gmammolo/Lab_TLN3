  "text": "Thales +0.30% Thales are paving the way with new Remote Weapon Systems (RWS) technology. 11 Sep 2025 Share this article\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn The remotely controlled weapon stations will enable users to operate from a distance, allowing deployment to be further forward, increasing the safety and survivability of the operator while offering the potential to increase combat mass.\nThales have been investing in RWS for a number of years and are also experts in the fields of C2 and secure communications. The development of this suite of systems is part of a series of enhancements that Thales are making to their SHORAD capabilities to ensure they remain lethal on the evolving battlefield to combat new threats. Thales are developing these RWS to support the need to digitise the battlefield. These RWS offer potential integration onto land, sea and air platforms while proving a unique offering of being able to launch laser-beam riding missiles, such as LMM, setting the system apart from other RWS on the market.\nAttachments\nOriginal document Permalink Disclaimer\nTHALES SA published this content on September 11, 2025 , and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.
