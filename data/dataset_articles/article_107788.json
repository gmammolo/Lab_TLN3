  "text": "NATO jets shoot down Russian drones after airspace violation in Poland\nRepresentative image |\nNATO fighter jets shot down Russian drones that breached Poland’s airspace during Moscow’s overnight strikes on Ukraine, NATO officials and Poland’s military confirmed on Wednesday.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Polish F-16s, Dutch F-35s, Italian AWACS surveillance aircraft, a NATO refueling tanker, and a German Patriot air defense system were involved in securing the airspace.\n“Our air defenses were activated and successfully assured the protection of NATO territory,” Rutte stated.\nWhile NATO’s founding Article 5 stipulates that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all, Poland opted not to invoke it. Instead, Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that Warsaw has requested consultations under Article 4, which is triggered when any member believes its security or territorial integrity is under threat.\nTusk addressed the nation and said, “Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones. Those that posed a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies. We are monitoring the situation closely, and our operation is ongoing.”\nMilitary officials reported that Polish air defenses intercepted drones that could have posed significant danger. NATO allies remain on high alert amid escalating tensions along the alliance’s eastern flank.",
