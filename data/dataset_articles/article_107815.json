The group is allied with, but separate from, the Afghan Taliban, which seized power in Kabul in 2021.\nThe military said fourteen militants were killed in an operation Wednesday in Mohmand district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near the Afghan border, and five others were killed in raids Thursday in the districts of North Waziristan and Bannu.\nThe Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, attacked a security camp in Bannu last week, killing six soldiers.\nThe raids came two days after Maj. Adnan Aslam died at a military hospital from wounds sustained in the Sept. 2 attack on a security camp in Bannu. A video circulating online showed Aslam shielding a wounded soldier during the assault before returning fire and killing an attacker, despite being critically wounded.\nAslam has been hailed as a hero, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir attended his funeral this week.\nPakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks, most claimed by the Pakistani Taliban and Baloch separatists in the southwest.\nUS newsand global updates from Pakistan, Nepal, UK, Bangladesh, and Russia get all the latest headlines in one place with including\nNepal Proteston Hindustan Times.\nUS newsand global updates from Pakistan, Nepal, UK, Bangladesh, and Russia get all the latest headlines in one place with including\nNepal Proteston Hindustan Times.\nNews/\nWorld News/ Pakistani security forces kill 19 militants in raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Bannu",
