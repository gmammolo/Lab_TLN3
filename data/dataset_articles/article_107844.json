  "text": "General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) and AeroVironment have demonstrated the ability of a Switchblade 600 loitering munition to deploy from an MQ-9A Reaper unmanned air vehicle.\nThe work took place during July at the US Army’s Yuma Proving Grounds Test Range, says GA-ASI.\nSource: GA-ASI\nLaunching from an airborne platform such as the Reaper will boost the effective range of the Switchblade 600\n“This cooperative effort showcased how combining different unmanned technologies could really provide value and effects to the warfighter,” said GA-ASI president David Alexander.\n“By using MQ-9A to carry the Switchblade, the MQ-9A is able to stand off farther from enemy weapons systems and increase the range of the SB600, which will provide greater access and options in contested airspace.”\nTwo loitering munitions were launched: one with an inert warhead and one high-explosive round. An image provided by GA-ASI shows an MQ-9B with a pair of launch tubes under its left wing, with a SwitchBlade 600 launching.\nAfter launch control of the Switchblade was transferred from the MQ-9A’s ground control station to a ground operator closer to the operational area.\nAccording to AeroVironment, the SwitchBlade 600 has an endurance of 40min and can engage hardened targets at great distances.\nThe baseline SwitchBlade 600 is man portable tube-launched munition. It is equipped with a high-resolution electro-optical/infrared sensor.",
