  "text": "India is set to approve a landmark defence project with France’s Safran to co-develop a 120 kN jet engine for the AMCA fighter under full technology transfer.\nIndia is likely to give the green signal to a major defence project with French aerospace company Safran and the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s (DRDO) Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE), according to a Hindustan Times report.\nThe plan is to jointly design and build a powerful 120-kilonewton (kN) jet engine for India’s upcoming twin-engine fighter aircraft, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA).\nThe decision comes soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech, highlighted the need for India to build its own jet engines. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has also said that India is ready to take on this challenge.\nAs per the report, Safran and DRDO will develop nine engine prototypes over 12 years. The first models will generate 120 kN of thrust, and later versions could be scaled up to 140 kN.\nA key highlight of this collaboration is that it will be carried out under Indian intellectual property rights. Safran will transfer complete technology to DRDO, including advanced “single-crystal blade” technology. These blades, made from special super-alloys, help engines handle extreme heat and pressure, making them more powerful and durable.\nWhy is 120 kN thrust important?\n- Thrust (kN): It measures the power of a jet engine. One kilonewton (kN) equals the force needed to move about 100 kilograms.\n- 120 kN engine: This means the engine can generate enough force to push around 12,000 kilograms forward.\n- For a modern twin-engine fighter like the AMCA, two such engines would provide immense power for high-speed combat, carrying heavy weapons, and long-distance missions.\nWhile DRDO already has some experience in jet engine development, making engines for high-thrust combat aircraft is considered one of the toughest challenges in defence technology. The Safran-DRDO talks have been going on for almost two years, but the government has now asked DRDO to finalise the proposal, which is expected to get clearance soon.\nThe AMCA fighter itself is being developed with strong participation from India’s private sector, with Tata Group, Larsen & Toubro, and Adani Defence expected to be key partners.\nPrime Minister Modi believes that building indigenous jet engines is not only important for India’s security but can also lead to new technologies for civilian use.\nCurrently, only the US, Russia, the UK, and France can design and produce aircraft engines on their own. China still depends on Russian engines or copies of them. India’s earlier attempt, the Kaveri engine project, did not succeed in creating a fully operational fighter engine.\nIndia has also signed agreements with US company General Electric (GE) to supply F-404 and GE-414 engines, but the technology transfer from the US is limited to about 70%.\nIn contrast, the Safran deal is expected to give India complete know-how. Officials told Hindustan Times that India values France as a reliable partner, noting that France stood by India even after the 1998 nuclear tests, continuing to supply Mirage-2000 spares and advanced navigation systems for missiles.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.
