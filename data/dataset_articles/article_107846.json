  "text": "The Norwegian state-owned energy giant Equinor has obtained the drilling permit for a wellbore in the Norwegian Sea.\nCOSL Innovator rig; Source: COSL Thanks to the authorization granted by the Norwegian Offshore Directorate (NOD), Equinor can drill the 6507/8-12 S wildcat in production license 124 B , whose production was extended to December 31, 2045, last year. Per NOD data, the planned entry date for the drill permit is November 2025.\nThe rig to be used for this assignment is COSL Drilling’ s COSL Innovator . The 2012-built semi-submersible rig is of GM4000 design. It is designed to operate in water depths up to 750 meters.\nCOSL Innovator was booked by Equinor in August 2023 for a two-year assignment, starting in the second quarter of 2025. If options for three more years after the firm contract ends in mid-2027 are exercised, the rig could continue working with Equinor until the second half of 2030.\nEquinor is the operator and 25.69% interest holder in production license 124 B, with partners Petoro (36.39%), ConocoPhillips Skandinavia (27.91%), and Vår Energi (10%).\nAlongside securing this permit, Equinor is working on getting regulatory approvals for its business combination with Shell. The duo decided last year to combine their UK offshore oil and gas assets into a new incorporated joint venture, Adura .\nNeil McCulloch was recently appointed Chief Executive Officer of the new entity and Nicoletta Giadrossi Chair of the offshore UK incorporated joint venture. Equinor and Shell claim that the appointments mark “a key step” in establishing Adura as the UK North Sea’s largest independent producer.\nRelated Article Shell and Equinor take ‘key step’ to set up their UK North Sea JV with CEO appointment Human Capital",
