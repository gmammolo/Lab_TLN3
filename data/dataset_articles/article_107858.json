  "text": "2 Min Read\nA delegation from the US Department of Defence and senior executives from Boeing Company are expected to visit India next week to revive negotiations over a stalled $4 billion deal for surveillance aircraft, according to officials in New Delhi. The talks come amid renewed efforts to strengthen bilateral defence and trade ties, Bloomberg reported.\nIndia is expected to discuss the purchase of six additional P-8I naval patrol aircraft, Bloomberg quoted sources requesting anonymity. Although the deal received initial clearance in 2019, progress had since stalled.\nNew Delhi had earlier purchased eight P-8Is from Boeing in a $2.2 billion deal in 2009, followed by four more roughly a decade later. These aircraft, stationed in Tamil Nadu, are a key component of India's maritime surveillance strategy, used extensively to monitor the Indian Ocean Region and key maritime choke points.\nThe expected visit follows comments by US President Donald Trump, who announced the resumption of US-India trade talks and said he would speak with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks. Trump had previously imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports, citing concerns over India's ties with Russia, particularly oil purchases that Washington claims help fund Russia's war in Ukraine.\nDespite recent trade tensions, the upcoming visit signals continued strategic engagement between the two nations — particularly in defence. A successful deal could also help reduce the US trade deficit with India, a long-standing concern of Trump’s administration.\nIndia, historically one of the world's largest arms importers, has been reducing its dependency on Russian defence equipment. According to a March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia's share of Indian arms imports fell to 36% in 2023, down from 76% in 2009.\nSimultaneously, India has deepened its defence cooperation with the United States, signing deals worth nearly $20 billion since 2018, according to the US Congressional Research Service. This includes a $3+ billion agreement in October 2024 to acquire 31 long-range drones from General Atomics, a leading US defence manufacturer.\nIndia is expected to discuss the purchase of six additional P-8I naval patrol aircraft, Bloomberg quoted sources requesting anonymity.
