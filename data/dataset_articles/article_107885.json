In total, Russia has four such vessels.\nThe MPSV07-class ship has a power of about 4 MW. It is equipped with diving systems, remotely operated vehicles, a side-scan sonar, electronic warfare systems, and can be used for seabed surveys.\n“At the moment of the attack by the Defense Intelligence’s special forces, the Russian ship was conducting electronic reconnaissance and patrolling the approaches to Novorossiysk Bay, where the aggressor has stationed the remnants of its Black Sea Fleet. The specialists of the Defense Intelligence struck precisely with a Ukrainian-made combat drone at the ship’s command bridge, where navigation and communication equipment is located,” the agency said.\nAs a result of the strike, the ship was put out of action and requires expensive repairs. Its electronic warfare equipment was also destroyed.\n- On August 28, Ukraine's Defense Intelligence struck a Kalibr missile carrier – a Russian Buyan-M class\nwarship– in the Sea of Azov near temporarily occupied Crimea.\n- News\nMore news",
