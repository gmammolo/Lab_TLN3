  "text": "Ukrainian forces block Russian advance in Kupiansk — Achilles regiment commander\nThe Ukrainian Defense Forces have blocked the Russian advance in Kupiansk and cleared the areas where Russian troops had managed to establish positions\nCommander of Ukraine's 429th \"Achilles\" Separate Regiment of Unmanned Systems Yuriy Fedorenko shared the information on Espreso TV.\n“At the moment, our units are carrying out combat missions in the Kharkiv region. In Kupiansk, the Defense Forces managed to block Russian units and clear them from the areas where they had previously infiltrated. On the northwestern outskirts of the city, we have also brought under fire control the locations where the enemy is attempting the most concentrated crossings from the left to the right bank. Their crossing looks like a rope stretched across the river; it is not a standard pontoon crossing. However, boats and rafts allow the enemy to transport personnel, albeit with difficulty,” Fedorenko said.\nHe also reported that Russian forces conducted active assault operations throughout the night in the area of the settlement of Milove.\n“In the Dvorichna area, there are no changes. Near the settlement of Milove, heavy and intense fighting continued throughout the night. The Russian troops crossed the state border slightly south of Milove. As a result, the Ukrainian Defense Forces met them with combat, preventing them from breaking through the border to any significant extent,” he said.\n- News\nMore news",
