  "text": "Ukraine and Poland have agreed to cooperate at the military level to counter Russian drones, including Shahed kamikaze drones.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky announced this after talks with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.\nAccording to Tusk, fragments of Russian drones, including Iranian-made Shahed drones, were found in many towns and villages across Poland.\nZelenskyy emphasized that since the beginning of the attack, the Ukrainian military has been sharing all available information with partners, and the cooperation continues.\n“We need to work on a joint air defense system and create an effective air shield over Europe,” the President of Ukraine emphasized.\nHe also called for increased funding for the production of interceptor drones, which have already proven their effectiveness.\nSeparately, Zelenskyy offered Poland assistance, training, and an exchange of experience in shooting down Russian drones.\nThe parties agreed on practical military cooperation, with Ukraine coordinating these efforts with all NATO member countries.\nAt least 19 Russian drones, including Shahed and Gerbera drones, entered Polish airspace via Belarus, after which the air forces of Poland and NATO countries intercepted them.\nAround 11 a.m., Polish President Karol Nawrocki announced the completion of the operation in Polish airspace to neutralize Russian drones.\nAdditionally, ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems were activated during the attack.\nDutch F-35 fighter jets neutralized the majority of the drones.\nПідтримати нас можна через:\nПриват: 5169 3351 0164 7408 PayPal - [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) Стати нашим патроном за лінком ⬇\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nor on ours Telegram\nThank you!!\nYou are subscribed to our newsletter",
