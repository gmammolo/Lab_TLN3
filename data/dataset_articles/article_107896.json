  "text": "Ukrainian Partisans ‌Claim Responsibility for Explosions in Russia Targeting unit Linked to⁣ Bucha ⁣Atrocities Khabarovsk ,Russia – Ukrainian partisans⁣ have claimed responsibility for explosions targeting a‌ Russian National Guard unit stationed in Khabarovsk,near the ⁣Chinese border,on⁢ September 8. The operation, dubbed “Revenge for ⁢Bucha,” was carried ‌out against ⁤the 748th Separate Battalion of the Rosgvardia (Troops 6912), according to ‍Janis Slaidiņš of the National Guard headquarters.\nThe attack is⁤ a​ direct response‍ to alleged war crimes committed by the targeted unit against ⁤civilians during the occupation of ⁣Bucha in 2022. This incident underscores a growing trend of‌ Ukrainian ‌resistance extending beyond occupied territories and increasingly operating within Russia itself.⁣ ‌for ⁣over a decade, and especially sence the full-scale ⁢Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian resistance movement has evolved from sporadic acts of⁢ defiance ‌into a multifaceted system⁢ encompassing guerilla warfare,⁣ intelligence gathering, sabotage, ‌and ‌psychological operations.\nSlaidiņš described the evolution of⁤ the resistance, noting its transformation from ⁤”poorly coordinated and insufficient disobedience” in 2014 ‍to a “sustainable resistance ⁣architecture” ‍by 2025. This shift ‌reflects a deliberate strategy to disrupt Russian operations and⁤ hold perpetrators of war crimes accountable,even within RussiaS borders.",
