  "text": "Turkish Ambassador to Qatar Dr. Mustafa Göksu underlined his country’s support for the Gulf country following an unprecedented Israeli attack on Tuesday that targeted Hamas officials.\nSpeaking to Qatari media on Thursday, Göksu condemned the attack targeting Hamas’s negotiations team with Israel, hosted by Qatar. He branded the attack as an attempt targeting Qatar’s security, stability and its role as mediator. He said the attack was a deliberate step to destabilize the region and Türkiye mobilized all resources to support the state of Qatar and its people.\nGöksu pointed out that Israel has rejected a cease-fire with the Palestinians and countered all mediating efforts. “Targeting Qatar, a mediator country hosting a Hamas delegation working on a cease-fire proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump, has exposed once again Israel’s stand on this matter,” he said. The envoy reminded President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s definition of the attack as a blatant violation of international law and Qatar’s sovereignty, adding that Türkiye would stand strongly with its strategic ally Qatar.\n“Israel demonstrated its intention to deepen the destabilizing efforts in the region with this attack. However, those adopting terrorism as state policy will never achieve their goals,” he stated.\nThe ambassador also stressed that Türkiye would adhere to its stance against Israel’s reckless attacks in Gaza, adding that they would continue defending “international law and freedom of our Palestinian brothers and sisters at any cost.”\nQatar on Thursday denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “reckless” remarks demanding the expulsion or prosecution of Hamas officials, a day after Israeli warplanes struck a building in Doha, killing at least six people in a neighborhood home to embassies and schools.\nThe attack, which hit the territory of a key U.S. ally, drew swift condemnation across the Middle East and beyond, as critics warned it risked derailing ongoing mediation efforts to end the war and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza.\nNetanyahu defended the strike and threatened further action against Qatar, saying, “You either expel them or you bring them to justice. Because if you don’t, we will.”\nHis comments came just a day after Trump urged calm in what was described by the Wall Street Journal as a heated phone call with the Israeli leader. Trump reportedly told Netanyahu that targeting Hamas inside Qatar was “not wise,” underscoring the gravity of striking a U.S. ally’s capital.\nQatar said it hosts Hamas officials with the knowledge and support of both Washington and Tel Aviv as part of mediation efforts that have helped secure cease-fires and the release of Israeli hostages in the past. The Gulf nation stressed that Netanyahu’s threats undermine diplomacy and jeopardize the safety of civilians. An Israeli official, speaking anonymously, said about 10 planes dropped around 10 missiles in the mission. Netanyahu later admitted he acted on a narrow window of opportunity.\nDoha’s strong rebuke signals a deepening rift, as many in the region view Israel’s escalation as a blatant violation of international law and an attack on a sovereign U.S.-backed partner that has long played a pivotal role in de-escalation talks.",
