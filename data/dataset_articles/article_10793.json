  "text": "Loyal Carnival cruisers are in for a sea of change.\nThe cruise line announced today, 18th June 2025, that its current VIFP (Very Important Fun Person) program will be phased out in favour of a new loyalty initiative, set to launch on 1st June 2026.\nDubbed Carnival Rewards, the new loyalty structure will be the first of its kind in the cruise industry, introducing a dual-earning model that rewards guests not only for cruising – but also for how much they spend.\nPoints and Stars: A New Way to Cruise and Earn Unlike the VIFP system (and pretty much every other cruise line loyalty program) which is based solely on cruise nights, Carnival Rewards will offer guests two ways to benefit:\nCarnival Rewards Points – Redeemable for everything from spa treatments and specialty dining to onboard experiences and future cruise fares. Status Qualifying Stars – Used to determine your tier level, from Red to Diamond, based on your spend and engagement rather than just cruise nights. Points and stars will be earned on cruise fare, onboard purchases, and via Carnival’s co-branded Mastercard®, which will also be rebranded for the launch.\n“By introducing a points-based system, we’re enabling greater flexibility so guests can personalize their rewards in ways that matter most to them,”\nChristine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line.\nDuffy emphasised that the new program is designed to reward overall engagement, recognising frequent cruisers as well as high-spending guests and loyal Carnival Mastercard holders.\nCredit Card Perks & Everyday Rewards A standout feature of the program is its integration with the Carnival Rewards Mastercard. Cardmembers will be able to earn rewards even on land, giving them a chance to rack up points between cruises.\nFurther credit card perks will be unveiled closer to launch, but Carnival confirmed that existing cardholders’ Fun Points will convert to Carnival Rewards points when the program goes live.\nTiers, Status & Transition Plan The program’s status tiers – Red, Gold, Platinum and Diamond – will remain, but earning them will now be based on spend over a two-year window, rather than lifetime cruise nights alone.\nOnce earned, status will last two years, while existing Diamond members will retain their level until 31st May 2032. All other members will carry over their current tier status into the new program through 31st May 2028, offering a generous adjustment period.\nGuests can still earn VIFP status until the switchover date in June 2026.\nBacklash From Long-Time Carnival Fans Carnival’s announcement was met with swift and vocal backlash from many long-time cruisers, particularly those who have spent years working their way up the VIFP loyalty ladder.\nWhile some applauded the new emphasis on spend and flexibility, a significant number of guests expressed frustration over what they see as a devaluation of traditional loyalty.\nCommon concerns include the two-year expiration of status, the emphasis on high spending over cruise frequency, and the perception that the program disproportionately benefits those with Carnival’s co-branded credit card.\nMany commenters lamented that years of loyalty could effectively be wiped out if they don’t meet new spending thresholds.\n“I just got to Platinum after 26 years… now I’m a free agent,” one guest quipped. Others echoed the sentiment, stating the changes gave them a reason to explore competitors like Royal Caribbean, MSC, and Norwegian Cruise Line – some of which offer loyalty status matches.\nQuestions also swirled about fairness in shared spending. Couples, families, and guests using casino comps or travelling with children expressed confusion and concern over how points and status stars would be distributed.\nSome fans acknowledged the logic behind rewarding engagement and spend, but overall, Carnival’s social media pages quickly became flooded with disappointment. As one guest summarised, “It’s no longer a loyalty program… it’s a spending program.”\nCarnival Rewards will launch 1st June 2026, but Carnival is giving guests plenty of time to prepare. Current VIFP members will begin receiving email updates and loyalty tracking tools in the coming months, and a new website – carnivalrewards.com – has gone live with a preview of what’s coming.\nCarnival says guests will be able to track points and stars, view personalised offers, and redeem perks more easily than ever before.\nNEW DEALS JUST RELEASED!
