  "text": "Memories of ground zero endure for NYC firefighter who will not forget\nNow retired in Las Vegas, he honors those lost on 9/11\nThursday, Sept. 11, 2025 | 2 a.m.\nEditor's note: Este artículo está traducido al español.\nLike countless other New York City firefighters, Frank Pizarro charged without hesitation into the unthinkable devastation at the World Trade Center on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001.\nFor months afterward, he labored at ground zero — not returning home and sleeping amid the rubble where more than 2,700 people had perished in the terror attacks. He inhaled the toxic dust that hung heavy in the air, rarely taking breaks.\nYears later, now retired and settled in Las Vegas, Pizarro reflects on those harrowing months with unwavering conviction: He would do it all over again.\nTwenty-four years after the deadliest terrorist attack in history, he said people have questioned him, you’re still talking about that?\nHe bristles. He will not stop; he will not forget.\n“I’ve never seen a country more united than during the 9/11 period, and then people resorted back to who they were and how they treated each other. But we shouldn’t need a big tragedy to unite people,” Pizarro said.\n“People always have to remember that life is fragile, and at any given time, it could be an Oct. 1, or it could be a 9/11, or an Oct. 7,” he said, referencing the 2017 mass shooting on the Strip and the 2023 terrorist attack committed by Hamas militants in Israel.\nPizarro served in the U.S. Navy, which took him to Iraq during Desert Storm, before he joined the fire service in his native New York. He was off-duty and at home on the morning of Sept. 11 when his mother yelled for him.\n“I saw that a plane had hit the towers, and I said, ‘Well, that’s a terrible accident,’ but while watching it, I saw the second plane hit, and I said, ‘That’s not an accident,’ ” he said. “And I got my stuff on and ran to the firehouse.”\nWith a couple dozen other members of FDNY’s Engine Company 76 in Manhattan, he climbed into a truck normally used to thaw frozen hydrants in the winter and traveled down an eerily empty West Side Highway to the twin towers.\nThe south tower came down as they approached. The firefighters headed into the north tower. They were called out as that building also began to collapse. After retreating for a few minutes, they resumed rescues. Pizarro also went into WTC 7, a 47-story skyscraper adjacent to the twin towers, and was called out as that burning building too began to give way.\n“I spent the next five, six months down there trying to find what was left of anybody that was left,” he said. “It went quickly from a week of search and rescue to recovery.”\nNearly 3,000 people — including 343 firefighters — died Sept. 11, when hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center along with the Pentagon outside of Washington, D.C., and a field in rural Pennsylvania, presumably en route to the White House or U.S. Capitol before passengers and crew staged a revolt that prevented further devastation.\nPizarro retired from the fire service in 2017.\nHe married and moved to Las Vegas, where his wife had a home, for a fresh start. He launched Firefighter Memorial Transport, a nonprofit that brings the caskets of firefighters, police officers and military veterans to their final resting places around the West Coast in modified service vehicles.\nAlso an accomplished professional singer — he was the lead singer of the enduring vocal group The Platters for 10 years — Pizarro uses his musical ability to recognize the tragedy. He frequently sings “The Star-Spangled Banner” at memorial ceremonies and other high-profile events. Although he is traveling out of town this year, he frequently sings at the early-morning tribute Sept. 11 at Las Vegas Fire & Rescue’s Station 5 at 1020 Hinson St., near Charleston and Valley View boulevards.\nA piece of steel from the World Trade Center is on display there, and a pear tree grown from a seedling taken from a tree that survived the tower collapses grows on the grounds.\nPizarro said that for a while after the attacks, people who normally wouldn’t talk to each other were helping and caring for one another. They didn’t do it forever. And some people choose to forget about 9/11 because it’s easier for them, he said.\n“I choose not to because I always want to remember the sacrifices that were made, because you’re honoring the people who died.”",
