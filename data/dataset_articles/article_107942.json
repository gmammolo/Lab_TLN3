  "text": "Ukrainian drones strike over 60,000 Russian targets in August — Ukraine’s top general\nIn August 2025, Ukrainian drones struck over 60,000 targets. The largest share of destroyed Russian equipment and personnel came from kamikaze drones and strike bombers\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi reported this following the monthly meeting on the development of the drone forces.\n“Ukrainian drones have inflicted serious damage on Russia both at the tactical level and deep in the rear. This includes the destruction of and damage to logistics and supply facilities, including oil refineries, ammunition depots, air defense systems, as well as the effective operation of drones directly on the front line,” Oleksandr Syrskyi emphasized.\nIntelligence report\nAccording to intelligence officials, Russian forces continue to adapt and, as usual, copy Ukrainian technologies, particularly in the field of interceptor drones.\n“We are facing a direct technological race in which the advantage will go to those who not only modernize but outpace. Our task is the continuous improvement of existing solutions and the development of new technologies and tactics for using drone systems,” the Commander-in-Chief emphasized.\nHe added that in August, Ukrainian drones struck over 60,000 targets.\n“Drones, both kamikaze and strike bombers, remain in the lead, accounting for the largest share of destroyed Russian equipment and personnel,” Syrskyi clarified.\nDrone Line – a key priority\nThe Commander-in-Chief noted that the Drone Line project is one of the priority directions.\n“We are actively expanding structures, forming new units, and conducting intensive crew training. We continue to strengthen strikes deep into Russian territory, targeting both equipment and personnel of the occupying forces. Successful operations have demonstrated the effectiveness of our tactics,” he said.\nDeep Strike\n“We are consistently reducing the military and economic potential of the Russian Federation. In August, a number of important targets were struck: oil refineries, defense industry facilities, and production capacities that supply the Russian army with fuel, drones, and missiles,” the Commander-in-Chief emphasized.\nElectronic warfare\nAccording to Syrskyi, Russian forces are increasing the depth of their strikes using drones, which requires strengthening Ukrainian electronic warfare units.\n“We are scaling up electronic warfare capabilities, and we are already seeing results – in August, the number of Russian drones suppressed by these systems increased,” the Commander-in-Chief noted.\nHe added that during the meeting, special attention was paid to analyzing the combat use of drones and processing large volumes of information.\n“Analyzing drone operations allows us to quickly adjust tactics, improve effectiveness, and stay ahead of Russia,” Syrskyi concluded.\n- Earlier, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi\nreportedthat in July 2025, Ukrainian drones struck 23,400 Russian targets.\n- News\nMore news",
