  "text": "Russiaâ€™s incursion into Polish airspace is jolting momentum in the Senate to pass a bipartisan sanctions bill against Moscow. It canâ€™t come soon enough for some Republicans.\nâ€œI hear every week, itâ€™s coming, itâ€™s coming. I just think we ought to stop talking about it. Thereâ€™s only one thing stopping us from passing those sanctions: The majority leader hasnâ€™t put it on the floor,â€� said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.\nRepublican leaders said conversations were picking back up after losing steam over the August break.\nâ€œIâ€™m for it. And Iâ€™ve been texting back and forth with other senators,â€� said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC, planned to meet with Trump to again make his case for presidential support, which Trump has withheld while pursuing unilateral measures to punish Russiaâ€™s trading partners.\nâ€œI think there will be a response,â€� said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. â€œI donâ€™t know anyone who is saying [Vladimir] Putin is the good guy in this â€¦ contrary to popular belief online.â€�",
