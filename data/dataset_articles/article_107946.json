  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nUK and Ukraine Join Forces to Manufacture Cost-Effective Air Defense Interceptor Drones\nThe UK will manufacture and jointly develop advanced military equipment with Ukrainian industry under a new technology-sharing agreement, UK government said in a press release on their official website on September 10.\nThe first project, Project OCTOPUS, is an air defense interceptor drone designed by Ukraine with support from UK scientists and technicians. Mass production in the UK aims to deliver thousands per month to Ukraine, providing a cost-effective solution against Russia’s waves of attack drones.\nInterceptor drones are considerably cheaper than traditional air defense missiles and can destroy incoming drones and missiles before they reach their targets, UK government states.\nThe agreement reflects growing industrial collaboration between Kyiv and London. Last week, UK Defence Secretary John Healey visited Kyiv and signed an expansion of the partnership, allowing joint development and exchange of intellectual property.\nThe deal is among the first of its kind with Ukraine, creating opportunities to expand industrial capacity and use defense as an engine for growth.\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the partnership was a landmark moment, combining British and Ukrainian expertise to deliver advanced drone technology against Russian aggression.\nHe added that it helps Ukraine defend itself while creating jobs, driving growth, and securing the UK’s future.\nDefence Secretary John Healey said the deal allows UK industry unprecedented access to cutting-edge equipment designs, supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s illegal invasion and demonstrating how defense can drive economic growth.\nProject OCTOPUS has already been deployed on the battlefield, proving highly effective against the Shahed drones Russia continues to use, while costing less than 10 percent of the drones it intercepts.\nThe UK is spending 4.5 billion pounds on military support for Ukraine this year, the largest amount provided to date. Last month, the Defence Secretary confirmed that the UK’s world-leading training programme for Ukrainian recruits would continue through 2026.\nThe UK has also committed to supplying over 5,000 air defense missiles, and to increasing drone deliveries from 10,000 in 2024 to 100,000 in 2025.\nPreviously, speaking at the start of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in London, John Healey said the UK will finance the production of long-range drones on its territory, which will then be transferred to Ukraine.",
