  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nOne of Only Four: Ukraine Sinks $60M Russian Support Vessel in Black Sea Raid\nUkrainian military intelligence (HUR) announced that its special forces struck and disabled a Russian Black Sea Fleet vessel near Novorossiysk on September 10, dealing a fresh blow to Moscow’s dwindling naval assets, HUR reported on September 11.\nAccording to HUR, the target was a Project MPSV07 multi-purpose support vessel, commissioned in 2015 and valued at roughly $60 million.\nRussia operates only four of the specialized ships, which are equipped with advanced sonar systems, remotely operated underwater vehicles, diving complexes, and electronic reconnaissance gear.\nAt the time of the strike, the Russian vessel was reportedly conducting signals intelligence and patrolling approaches to the Novorossiysk harbor—the fleet’s new stronghold after losing much of its presence in occupied Crimea.\nUkrainian operators used a domestically produced combat drone to hit the ship’s bridge, damaging its navigation and communications systems.\nThe strike destroyed the vessel’s electronic warfare equipment and left it disabled, forcing what HUR described as “costly repairs.”\nMilitary analysts note that, given its onboard equipment, the MPSV07-class ship could be used for both reconnaissance and sabotage missions in the Black Sea.\nEarlier, HUR released footage showing a special operations raid in the Black Sea that destroyed Russian equipment, personnel, and a patrol boat.",
