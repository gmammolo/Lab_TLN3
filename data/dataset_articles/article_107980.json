  "text": "In a move that is being seen as subtle support for India, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly endorsed the principle of cross-border counterterrorism strikes, invoking the US raid on Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad and Israel’s recent strike in Qatar. Describing the October 7 attack as Israel’s 9/11 moment and accusing Qatar of providing a safe haven to Hamas, Netanyahu said: “I say to Qatar and all nations who harbour terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice. Because if you don’t, we will.\" The Israeli PM, while drawing parallels between his country’s strike and US actions, said: “What did America do in the wake of September 11th? It promised to hunt down the terrorists who committed this heinous crime, wherever they may be. And it also passed a resolution in the UN Security Council, two weeks later, stating that governments cannot give harbour to terrorists. Well, yesterday, we acted along those lines.\" He added: “We did exactly what America did; went after Al-Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan and later killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan.\" Top Indian intelligence sources told CNN-News18 that Netanyahu’s remarks are being viewed in New Delhi as a strong endorsement of India’s position that Operation Sindoor, which targeted ISI-backed terror groups in Pakistan’s Bahawalpur and Muridke, was an act of legitimate self-defence and not aggression. Netanyahu reminded global critics that Israel, like the United States in 2011, acted under the UN Charter’s Article 51, which permits nations to take proportionate military action in self-defence. The statement aligns with India’s consistent position that prior international approval is not required when dealing with imminent cross-border terrorist threats. Indian officials argue that Pakistan’s continued support and safe haven for terror groups amounts to a direct threat to Indian sovereignty, justifying retaliatory strikes under international law. Operation Sindoor, launched after the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted key infrastructure linked to Pakistan-based terror networks. Indian sources say the strike was limited, precise, and targeted, designed to degrade the operational capabilities of terrorist groups actively planning further attacks on Indian soil. The Israeli leader’s comments are being seen not only as a strategic signal of solidarity but also as an affirmation of a new global consensus emerging around cross-border counterterrorism. From NATO’s actions post-9/11 to Israel’s regional strikes and India’s recent offensive, the norms of security engagement are shifting, say experts. Netanyahu’s statement is expected to strengthen India’s diplomatic case at multilateral forums, particularly as questions are raised by some countries over the legality of cross-border military operations. By drawing a legal and moral parallel between the operations, the Israeli prime minister has added crucial weight to India’s justification, reinforcing its right to defend itself without waiting for global consensus or approval.",
