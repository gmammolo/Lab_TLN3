  "text": "Dutch F-35s shoot down Russian drones over Poland\nNetherlands Ministry of Defence\nNews item | 10-09-2025 | 15:47\nPolish and Dutch fighter jets shot down Russian drones over Poland last night. The unmanned aircraft had entered NATO airspace.\nOperating as part of NATO's air defences, Polish and Dutch fighter jets scrambled to counter potential threats to Alliance territory. NATO took swift and decisive action against numerous Russian drones that had entered Polish airspace. Polish and Dutch fighter jets intercepted the drones and shot several of them down.\nAccording to Netherlands Minister of Defence Ruben Brekelmans, the Russian threat is not limited to Ukraine. Russian aggression also poses a broader threat to Europe. Because Russia is taking more risks, the threat to NATO territory is increasing. As was demonstrated last night by the sorties of its F-35s, the Netherlands can play a key role in the defence of that territory. Brekelmans went on to express pride in the professional and effective action of the F-35 pilots involved.\nThe Netherlands and Poland were not the only countries to respond. German Patriot missile units in Poland were placed on high alert. Furthermore, an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and an aircraft belonging to the Alliance's Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) fleet were deployed to fuel the fighter jets in the air.\nThe action taken demonstrated NATO's readiness and ability to defend Alliance territory.\nDutch F-35s arrive in Poland\nThe Netherlands has been providing F-35 aircraft to assist in the defence of NATO territory since 1 September. It is not the first time that Dutch F-35s have scrambled in Poland in response to Russian projectiles that were posing a threat to NATO territory. It is the first time, however, that the Netherlands has had to use force to neutralise the threat.\nNEWSLETTER\n|\nJoin the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list |\n|\n|",
