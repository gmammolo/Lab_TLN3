  "text": "Published on: September 11, 2025 2:45 PM\nSecurity forces killed at least 19 Indian-sponsored terrorists in three separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the ISPR confirmed Thursday. These intelligence-based operations (IBOs) targeted terrorist hideouts in Mohmand, North Waziristan, and Bannu districts. According to ISPR, the terrorists, referred to as “khawarij,” were involved in multiple violent activities across the region.\nOn 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.\nOn reported presence of Khwarij, an intelligence based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in general area…\n[pic.twitter.com/fA6eMWXZGj]— DG ISPR (@OfficialDGISPR)\n[September 11, 2025]\nThe first and largest operation took place in Guluno, Mohmand District. Troops engaged the terrorists in a fierce gunfight and killed 14 militants. Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the site. The military believes these terrorists were behind several recent attacks in the area.\nIn another operation, forces moved into the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan. There, they encountered more armed militants during the raid. After a short exchange of fire, four terrorists were neutralized. This successful strike further weakened the presence of militants in the region.\nMeanwhile, in a separate encounter in Bannu District, one terrorist was killed by Pakistani troops. This third engagement followed intelligence reports of militant activity in the area. The operation ended swiftly, with no reported casualties among security personnel.\nISPR stated that follow-up sanitization operations are ongoing to clear the areas of any remaining militants. The military reaffirmed its commitment to eradicating Indian-sponsored terrorism. Officials said they will continue efforts until peace is fully restored in all affected districts.",
