  "text": "The 1st Cavalry Division celebrated its 104th birthday with a week-long event known as “Cav Week.” The division hosted a variety of events and competitions to mark the occasion.\nCav Week, held annually, celebrates the division’s history and traditions, bringing together troopers, families and veterans. This was the first time in four years the entire division was able to celebrate Cav Week.\nPreliminary rounds of competition began Sept. 2, with troopers competing against one another for the Commander’s Cup trophy.\n“Every generation of Cav troopers has lived the legend, but now it’s our turn,” said Maj. Gen. Thomas M. Feltey, commanding general of 1st Cav. Div., prior to the division run. “Let’s get this week started. It’s a great team; it’s our team. We are the First Team.”\nThe First Team conducted its division-wide run Sept. 3, followed by a cake-cutting ceremony. Soldiers ran three miles down Legends Way.\nCarrying over into a battalion command team competition, troopers had the opportunity to cheer on their leaders as they competed in the Army Fitness Test on Cooper Field.\nOther numerous sporting events filled the week, such as basketball, volleyball, softball, biking and boxing, with Soldiers representing their units. There were also additional competitions, such as the five-stand skeet shooting, two-gun challenge, small unmanned aircraft system competitions and tug-of-war.\n“I’m very proud of what our boys in 3CR (3rd Cavalry Regiment) have done,” said Staff Sgt. Jessie Blalack, 3rd Cav. Regt. “I’m also proud of everybody that competed in every competition we had this week. It showed more heart than I have ever seen in any other unit that I have ever been in.”\nFeltey and Command Sgt. Maj. LeVares J. Jackson, command sergeant major of 1st Cav. Div., presented the Commander’s Cup to 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, during the Cav Week awards ceremony held Sept. 4.\nOn the evening of Sept. 4, a Cav Social was hosted at Cooper Field, inviting troopers, families, friends and veterans of 1st Cav. Div. to gather for food, music and games. The event offered an opportunity for members to connect.\nThe closing ceremony of Cav Week 104 was supported by the 1st Cav. Div. Band and Honor Guard, and featured members from every unit in the division in a pass in review. The grand finale was a historic horse cavalry charge, led by 1st Cav. Div. Horse Cavalry Detachment and supported by multiple aircraft from 1st Air Cavalry Brigade.\n“To our troopers, you are carrying the torch forward into the next chapter of the First Team’s history, and I couldn’t be prouder standing here with you today,” Feltey said. “As we close Cav Week 104, take with you the cohesion, the dominance and the pride you’ve built here. Take that back with you into your units, because one day, it won’t just be about winning trophies on Cooper Field, but about winning where it matters most.”",
