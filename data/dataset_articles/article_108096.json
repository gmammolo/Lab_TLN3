  "text": "Vietnam, Turkey strengthen defense cooperation Thursday, September 11, 2025 | 16:51:33 (VOVWORLD) - Vietnam consistently pursues a “four no” defense policy and a stance that all disputes and disagreements should be resolved through peaceful means in accordance with international law, especially the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS 1982), Minister of National Defense of Vietnam General Phan Van Giang told Turkish Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler at a reception Thursday in Hanoi. Talks are held between Vietnamese Defense Minister General Phan Van Giang and Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler (Photo: qdnd.vn) He said Vietnam always upholds its international commitments, including the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC), and supports the early conclusion of a substantive, effective, and legally consistent Code of Conduct in the East Sea (COC). Discussing defense cooperation orientations, the Defense Ministers of the two countries agreed to boost training, defence industry cooperation, and UN peacekeeping, continue mutual support in multilateral mechanisms and forums, and explore cooperation and experience exchanges in other areas such as naval and air forces, cybersecurity, non-traditional security response, military engineering, and mine clearance. Minister Giang expressed appreciation to Minister Guler for sending a delegation of Turkish defense industry enterprises to participate in the Vietnam International Defense Exhibition 2024. He confirmed Vietnam’s readiness to welcome defense enterprises and institutions, particularly those affiliated with the Turkish Ministry of Defense, to display products at future exhibitions. Minister Guler praised the cooperation between the two sides in training, particularly the historic deployment of a Turkish officer to Vietnam’s National Defense Academy, and pledged to continue sending officers for Vietnamese language training at the Military Science Academy. He said Turkey is ready to host Vietnamese officers and trainees for professional training programs in Turkey. Feedback Submit",
