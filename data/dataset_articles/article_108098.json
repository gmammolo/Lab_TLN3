  "text": "Iran, Tunisia to expand cooperation, unite against Israeli aggression\nIranian FM Araghchi and Tunisian President Kais Saied agreed to expand bilateral cooperation and coordinate on regional crises.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi affirmed on Wednesday the importance of strengthening bilateral ties between Iran and Tunisia across various fields, particularly in the economic, trade, and tourism sectors, while also highlighting the need for closer coordination on regional and international issues.\nHigh-level talks in Tunis\nDuring his visit to Tunis as part of a North African tour, Araghchi met with Tunisian President Kais Saied, who stressed the depth of fraternal relations between the two countries, describing them as rooted in mutual respect and shared positions. Saied reiterated Tunisia’s determination to enhance and expand bilateral cooperation, while commending Iran’s steadfast positions in support of Palestine and regional stability.\nAraghchi, in turn, expressed appreciation for Tunisia’s principled stance, particularly its condemnation of US and Israeli aggression against Iran and its rejection of ongoing Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people. He noted that both sides discussed the situation in West Asia, including \"Israel’s\" assault on Gaza, repeated attacks across the region, and the recent strike against Qatar.\nBoth parties emphasized the need to unify regional efforts to confront the policies of war and aggression pursued by the Israeli occupation.\nPress conference: key decisions announced\nSpeaking at a press conference in Tunis, Araghchi revealed that a series of decisions were made to deepen bilateral cooperation, including preparations for a new round of the Iran-Tunisia Joint Economic Committee.\nHe underlined that Tehran and Tunis share the view that “the Israeli threat is the greatest threat to the region,” stressing the urgency of a collective stance against it.\nThe Iranian foreign minister also issued a stark warning: “If the other side decides to repeat its failed experience, it will not achieve different results,” referring to recent US and Israeli attacks.\nOn the attack against Qatar, Araghchi said \"Israel\" had “proven it respects no red lines,” adding that the incident showed “no country in the region is safe from its strikes.”\nRead more: Iran ties new nuclear talks to protection from future attacks: Sources\nNuclear file and Europe’s role\nTurning to Iran’s nuclear program, Araghchi explained that recent Israeli strikes caused significant damage to nuclear facilities, preventing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) from resuming its work. He said this prompted a new agreement, which the IAEA welcomed.\nRegarding Europe, Araghchi dismissed threats from France, Germany, and Britain, warning that taking the issue to the UN Security Council would not resolve the situation. He stressed that the only viable path forward is to give diplomacy sufficient space, cautioning that escalatory European measures could further complicate the crisis.\nRead more: Grossi: IAEA, Iran to resume cooperation in respectful, full manner",
