  "text": "The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine hit a Russian multifunctional MPSV07-class ship with a drone.\nThe Defense Intelligence press service reported on this and published a video of the attack.\nThe strike on the enemy vessel took place on September 10, 2025, using a Ukrainian-made combat drone.\nAt the time of the attack, the enemy ship was conducting electronic reconnaissance and patrolling the approaches to the Novorossiysk bay, where the Russians base the remnants of their Black Sea Fleet.\nThe drone strike hit the bridge area, which houses the ship’s navigation and communication equipment.\nThe Defense Intelligence of Ukraine stated that the mentioned ship was commissioned by the Russians in 2015. Its value is approximately $60 million. The aggressor country has a total of four such vessels.\nThe intelligence officers noted that the MPSV07-class ship is equipped with diving systems, remotely operated vehicles, a side-scan sonar, and electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) equipment. It can be used for seabed surveying.\nAccording to the commissioning date, this refers to the ship Spasatel Demidov, which is registered to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea.\nIt is reported that the strike destroyed the enemy ship’s ELINT equipment, rendering the vessel out of service and requiring expensive repairs.\nПідтримати нас можна через:\nПриват: 5169 3351 0164 7408 PayPal - [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) Стати нашим патроном за лінком ⬇\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nor on ours Telegram\nThank you!!\nYou are subscribed to our newsletter",
