  "text": "TLDR Table of Contents\nToggle\nBNB reached a new all-time high of $904 after Binance partnered with Franklin Templeton The partnership focuses on securities tokenization and blockchain applications CEA Industries added $26 million worth of BNB to its treasury, now holding $368 million CEA aims to own 1% of BNB’s circulating supply by the end of 2025 BNB is currently trading around $883, with resistance at the $900 level BNB has reached a new all-time high of over $904, marking a major milestone for the cryptocurrency. The price surge happened after Binance announced a strategic partnership with Franklin Templeton, a global investment firm with $1.6 trillion in assets under management.\nThe price jumped nearly 3% in a single session, contributing to BNB’s impressive year-to-date returns of over 28%. This makes BNB one of the top performers in 2025.\nAfter hitting the new record high, BNB has slightly retraced to around $883, as traders consolidate their positions.\nThe partnership between Binance and Franklin Templeton aims to create digital asset programs that bridge traditional finance with blockchain applications. This collaboration will combine Franklin Templeton’s expertise in compliant securities tokenization with Binance’s globally trusted trading platform.\nRoger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, emphasized moving tokenization from “concept to practice.” He noted that tokenization enhances settlement, collateral management, and portfolio construction.\n$BNB is breaking through its only one sell wall.\nThe rally is starting again. pic.twitter.com/Pc1ejlsWKl\n— CW (@CW8900) September 10, 2025\nCorporate Treasury Accumulation Another factor driving BNB’s price growth is the accumulation by corporate treasuries. CEA Industries, traded on Nasdaq under the symbol BNC, recently purchased 30,000 BNB tokens worth approximately $26 million.\nThis latest purchase brings CEA Industries’ total holdings to 418,888 tokens, valued at $368 million. The company has declared an ambitious goal to own one percent of BNB’s circulating supply by the end of 2025.\nIf CEA Industries fully executes its plan, including warrants that could add $750 million, its BNB treasury could exceed $1.25 billion. CEO David Namdar described this effort as part of a larger $100-200 billion shift into digital asset treasuries.\nTechnical Analysis BNB is currently trading at $883.69, showing a modest daily gain of 0.42%. The token is consolidating just below the key $900 resistance level, which has capped gains in recent trading sessions.\nBuyers are defending the $870 support zone, which has acted as a reliable floor during recent retracements. This price action suggests traders are positioning for another attempt to break above $900.\nBNB Price on CoinGecko\nTechnical indicators show positive momentum building. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) reads 0.09, indicating mild but steady capital inflows into BNB. This suggests accumulation is taking place, even as broader market conviction remains cautious.\nThe BBPower indicator stands at 30.27, signaling a recovery in bullish energy following the recent consolidation period. If momentum continues to build, BNB could not only retest the $900 level but potentially move toward $950.\nBNB currently has a market capitalization of $122.18 billion, securing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by value. Trading volume remains solid at $1.00 billion over 24 hours, showing persistent interest from both institutional and retail participants.\nThe current circulating supply of BNB is 139.18 million tokens. The steady demand for BNB reflects confidence from long-term holders while offering shorter-term trading opportunities as the price hovers near pivotal levels.\nMarket watchers are anticipating a potential breakout above $900, which would confirm the next phase of BNB’s bullish trend. A decisive daily close above this zone would mark a significant shift in market structure, signaling renewed buyer dominance.\nOn the downside, failure to clear the resistance may bring short-term consolidation. However, the pattern of higher lows indicates that buyers remain determined to maintain upward pressure despite intermittent selling.\nThe most recent catalyst for BNB’s price movement was the Binance-Franklin Templeton alliance announcement. Catherine Chen, a Binance executive, stated that the firm has a history of pioneering crypto solutions and emphasized that the partnership would accelerate the integration of capital markets with BNB and other digital assets.",
