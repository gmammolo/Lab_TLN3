  "text": "As confirmed by publisher Electronic Arts , those with access to Battlefield Labs will be able to try an all-new battle royale mode this week. First and foremost, it will feature an all-new map that's been designed specifically for battle royale. It includes a range of instinct points of interest, plus multiple types of vehicle to help you get around. Tactical destruction will also be an integral part of the mode, giving you the opportunity to destroy parts of buildings in order to get the edge on your opponents. The mode will also feature the ability to revive members of your squad and complete missions to get your hands on more powerful gear. This is all on top of \"the deadliest ring\" in the genre, that will instantly kill any players on contact.",
