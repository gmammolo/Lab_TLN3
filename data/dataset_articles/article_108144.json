  "text": "The kibbutz’s 26-member security squad fought off some 60 invading terrorists, forcing them to retreat.>\nBy World Israel News Staff\nThe Israeli military failed to defend Kibbutz Magen during the October 7 invasion, leaving the Gaza-adjacent community to face waves of terrorists on its own, according to an internal IDF probe.\nThe investigation, which took three months to complete, found that IDF forces did not arrive at the kibbutz until 1:30 p.m. — nearly seven hours after the assault began.\nBy that time, the local security squad had already fought off the terrorists and forced them to retreat.\nThe probe concluded that the only thing preventing the massacre of residents was the kibbutz’s security squad , made up of 26 armed members.\nBetter prepared than other local kibbutz defense teams, the Magen defenders fought off three waves of 20–30 terrorists each, who attacked starting at 6:30 a.m.\n“The fighting of the members of the security squad…together with the residents of the kibbutz who volunteered [to join the battle], repelled the terrorists, led to their retreat to the Gaza Strip, and prevented heavy casualties and damage,” the IDF report stated.\nThe investigation credited security coordinator Baruch Cohen, who was wounded in battle, and his team with minimizing casualties.\nMagen residents Avraham “Avi” Fleisher, 63, and Ofir Mordechai Yaron, 51, were killed defending the kibbutz. Cohen and another member of the squad were wounded by gunfire while fighting the invading terrorists.\nDespite Hamas’s repeated attempts — lasting nearly five hours — the terrorists ultimately retreated after failing to overrun the kibbutz or carry out kidnappings.\nThe report noted that, compared with the mass killings and abductions at other border communities, Kibbutz Magen’s defense prevented large-scale loss of life.\nOnce IDF troops finally arrived at around 1:30 p.m., they searched the kibbutz for about five hours before declaring the area clear of terrorists and weapons.\nResidents were evacuated the following day.",
