  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nUkraine and Poland Boost Military Cooperation to Counter Russian Drone Attacks on Europe\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk have agreed to exchange expertise in countering Russian drones, as they discussed the growing threat to Ukraine and NATO’s eastern flank, Zelenskyy said in a post on his official Telegram page on September 10.\nZelenskyy also talked with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to address the latest Russia’s aerial attacks.\nZelenskyy highlighted a significant increase in Russian drone activity overnight, with drones crossing Ukrainian airspace and entering Poland.\nThis marked a sharp escalation, with drones now originating not only from Ukraine but also Belarus, representing a new level of aggression. Zelenskyy stressed that this requires a unified response from Europe and NATO.\n“There are several reasons for Russia’s defiant behavior, and they are all quite obvious. We need to work on a joint air defense system and create an effective air shield over Europe,” he stated.\nTusk and Zelenskyy shared updates on the attack’s aftermath, with debris from Russian and Iranian Shahed drones found across several towns and villages. Ukrainian military officials have been providing real-time intelligence to both NATO and Poland.\nThe President also reiterated Ukraine’s long-standing proposal for a shared air defense system to protect Europe and stressed the importance of increased funding for interceptor drones.\nHe offered Poland Ukraine’s support in training and expertise for countering Russian drones, specifically the Shahed model, and confirmed the continuation of military cooperation.\nZelenskyy’s discussions with European leaders will also extend to broader coordination within NATO to combat the increasing drone threat.\nPreviously, Poland had confirmed that 19 Russian drones crossed into its airspace overnight, with many entering from Belarus, Prime Minister Donald Tusk told lawmakers in the Polish Parliament.",
