  "text": "Indian PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday interacted with his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni when they agreed on the need for an early and peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\"PM Modi reiterated India’s full support for efforts in this direction,\" the Ministry of External Affairs said, sharing details about the interaction between the two Prime Ministers.\nThe leaders reviewed and positively assessed the developments in bilateral Strategic Partnership across sectors such as investment, defence, security, space, science & technology, education, people-to-people ties and counter-terrorism.\n\"Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment towards further deepening of the Partnership, in line with the Joint Strategic Action Plan 2025-29,\" the statement said.\nPrime Minister Meloni reiterated Italy’s strong support for the conclusion of a mutually beneficial India-EU Free Trade Agreement at the earliest and for the success of the AI Impact Summit to be hosted by India in 2026.\nThe leaders also agreed on taking steps to promote connectivity under India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEEC) initiative.\nThe two leaders discussed the ongoing issue in Ukraine just a day after a Russian airstrike on a Ukrainian village in the frontline region of Donetsk had reportedly killed more than 20 – including many elderly civilians who were lining up to collect pension payments.\nThe attack on Yarova injured nearly 20 others. Many elderly civilians have decided to stay at home in frontline communities, despite the escalating danger from Russia’s continuing offensive, said Assistant Secretary-General Matthias Schmale, the UN’s top humanitarian official in the country.\nSupport Our Journalism\nWe cannot do without you.. your contribution supports unbiased journalism\nIBNS is not driven by any ism- not wokeism, not racism, not skewed secularism, not hyper right-wing or left liberal ideals, nor by any hardline religious beliefs or hyper nationalism.
