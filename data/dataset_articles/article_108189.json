  "text": "Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine has taken and disrupted lives, destroyed infrastructure and left businesses facing extraordinary challenges. Yet even in these difficult times, small firms are managing not just to keep their lights on, but to adapt and even grow.\nSince 2019, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), together with the European Union (EU), has been helping Ukrainian companies gain access to much-needed finance, enabling them to modernise equipment and production processes, boost competitiveness and create jobs.\nNow, the EU4Business-EBRD Credit Line programme is providing additional support to companies led by veterans and to those rebuilding their businesses after losing assets, making sure that no one is left behind.\nPeanut Butter TOM and Vivat Invest are just two examples of how this support is translating into real impact on the ground.\nTreats from Lviv\nUkraine is home to more than 1.2 million war veterans. Taras Fityo, the co-owner of snack manufacturer Peanut Butter TOM, is one of them. His company produces much-loved treats made with peanut butter and chocolate, tapping into modern nutritional trends and winning over a growing customer base.\nFounded in 2012, the Lviv-based company quickly became a leading manufacturer of snacks sold online and in major supermarkets across Ukraine. Its treats combine a great taste with high-quality ingredients, nutritional value and ease of storage – extremely important in wartime conditions.\n“Our secret is simple: only the best ingredients, with no compromises,” says Fityo. “For us, business is more than just work or providing for our families – it is an opportunity to make a real difference. Our mission is to create social impact by developing and diversifying the Ukrainian market, promoting healthy and natural snacks and contributing to the country’s economy.”\nDespite the ongoing war, Peanut Butter TOM decided to build on its success by scaling up production. Thanks to an EBRD loan from Bank Lviv and a 25 per cent EU investment incentive, it was able to upgrade its production equipment under the new reintegration window of the EU4Business-EBRD Credit Line, buying a modern chocolate processing machine that helped increase capacity to 200 kg an hour, ensuring the firm could keep pace with rising demand.\nThe investment also resulted in a 24 per cent energy saving and much lower environmental footprint, making production more sustainable.\n“Our team is a family united by shared values,” adds Fityo. “Investments allow us not only to bring bold ideas to life, but also to preserve natural quality and explore new flavours. With new equipment, we have already optimised our workflow and boosted production efficiency, laying the foundation for future growth and stronger competitiveness.”",
