  "text": "Assistance for Those Affected by the Attack on Odesa\nYesterday, volunteers from the Ukrainian Red Cross emergency response team in the Odesa region arrived promptly at the scene of the attack. They provided immediate assistance to victims and supported emergency workers during the clean-up operation.\nShortly afterwards, humanitarian aid was distributed, including food parcels, plastic sheeting, and tarpaulins to support temporary repairs to damaged homes. During the distribution, volunteers remained on duty to offer first aid and psychological first aid where needed. In total, first aid was provided to three people, and psychological first aid was delivered to five others.\nAccording to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the attack on Odesa on the night of 7 September damaged a multi-storey residential building, where firefighters extinguished a blaze on the top floor. Another nine-storey building, a warehouse, and a car also caught fire. The city’s Sports Palace sustained damage as well. All fires have now been extinguished.",
