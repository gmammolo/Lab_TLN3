  "text": "Britain to manufacture 1,000 air defense interceptor drones for Ukraine\nThe defense ministers of Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed an agreement for Britain to manufacture Ukrainian-designed interceptor drones, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on X.\nThe initial plan involves producing 1,000 drones, all of which will be delivered to Ukraine.\nUkraine aims to further scale up such projects, attract investments, and advance related technologies.\nDuring a meeting with U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey, they reviewed outcomes from the latest Ramstein-format meeting and coordinated issues for the next meeting in October.\nUse of interceptor drones\nAmid escalating Russian attacks and an increasing number of aerial targets launched by Russian forces, Ukrainian troops have begun using interceptor drones.\nOn July 4, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported that during a major Russian assault involving 550 drones and missiles, these drones successfully downed dozens of targets.\nZelenskyy said Russia plans to launch up to 1,000 drones daily against Ukraine, but interceptor drones offer a solution capable of neutralizing “nearly all” such threats.\nIn late July, Zelenskyy announced that industrial production of interceptor drones had started, with 10 companies involved in the effort.\n- Share:",
