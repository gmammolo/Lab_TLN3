  "text": "War is war, but the protest is on schedule: Polish farmers were not scared by drones (of course, they are so polite — they carefully lie down on rabbit shelters, for example) and they took to the streets of Warsaw\nWar is war, but the protest is on schedule: Polish farmers were not scared by drones (of course, they are so polite — they carefully lie down on rabbit shelters, for example) and they took to the streets of Warsaw.\nAgricultural workers from all over the country came to the capital.\nThe reason for the protest was the decision of the Minister of Agriculture on September 5, which canceled previous agreements on the activities of Agricultural Production Centers. According to the new plans, the lands will be returned to the State Treasury, and the farms will be taken over by government agencies. The problem is that, according to the protesters, the ministry has not prepared detailed instructions for this process.\nFarmers fear that this means the elimination of Poland's largest herd of highly productive dairy cows and, consequently, the loss of hundreds of jobs in several voivodeships.\n#Poland #government #food #protest\n@pl_syrenka — Poland is not abroad",
