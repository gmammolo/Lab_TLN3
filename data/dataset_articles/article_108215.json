  "text": "World News\nFresh EU sanctions on Russia underway – Ukraine President Zelenskyy list targets\nThe President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said fresh European Union, EU, sanctions against Russia are underway.\nZelenskyy said the sanction will focus on the Russian banking sector, banks in third countries that continue trading with Russia, and what he described as the “shadow fleet” infrastructure that funds Russia’s war budget.\nHe disclosed that the imminent sanctions are in reaction to the 19 Russian drones that entered the EU territory on Wednesday.\nPosting on X, Zelenskyy wrote: “After yesterday’s deliberate incursion of 19 Russian drones into EU territory, the best response would be a strong 19th EU sanctions package. Work on this package is now underway.\n“Priorities include Russia’s banking sector, banks in third countries that continue trading with Russia, and the “shadow fleet” infrastructure that funds Russia’s war budget: ship captains, insurers, oil terminals, and market operators enabling Russian schemes.\n“We are also preparing a European anti-circumvention tool to block Russia’s access to critical goods and shut down schemes designed to bypass sanctions. Consultations between the EU and the U.S. are ongoing to combine the full weight of sanctions pressure, especially against Russian energy revenues.\n“Ukraine continues to synchronize sanctions. UK sanctions against Russia are already in force in our jurisdiction, alongside Canada’s sanctions and all 18 EU packages. Japan’s sanctions are next, and we will complete that process this month.\n“Together with partners, we are working on further synchronization across jurisdictions. Since the start of this year, Ukraine has adopted 44 sanctions packages against Russian entities, their foreign enablers, and individuals fueling the war.\n“These measures target Russia’s military-industrial complex, supply chains for critical components, budget revenues, and individuals spreading Russian war propaganda and interference.\n“Most importantly, Ukraine’s proposals are increasingly becoming part of international sanctions policy. I thank all partners who help make this possible.”",
