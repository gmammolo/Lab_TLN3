  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nUkraine’s Chief Drone Commander Offers to Train Polish Troops to Shoot Down Russian Shaheds\nCommander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces Robert Brovdi—better known by his call sign Madyar—said he is ready to help train Polish troops in countering Russian drones on September 11.\nBrovdi said Ukrainian specialists, pilots, and drone operators would gladly share their frontline expertise with Poland, particularly in fighting Iranian-designed Shahed drones that Russia has been launching by the hundreds.\n“We are deeper into this issue than anyone else because of our daily involvement. Although we are not perfect yet—there hasn’t been enough time. Just six months ago, many experts in both Europe and Ukraine laughed at the prospect of 500 Shaheds a day,” Brovdi wrote.\nHe also warned that unchecked Russian strikes, combined with hesitation and indecision from the West, only “whet the appetites of war.”\nThe statement follows President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s earlier remarks that Ukraine had offered Poland training and assistance in destroying Russian drones. According to him, such cooperation will be arranged at the military-to-military level.\nBrovdi’s offer comes just a day after Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that 19 Russian drones violated Poland’s airspace overnight on September 10, many of them entering from Belarus. Polish officials said four were shot down, and the interior ministry confirmed that debris from an unidentified missile had also been found.\nOne drone crashed into a residential building in the village of Wyrki-Wola in Lublin Voivodeship, damaging the structure but causing no injuries.\nEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk agreed to exchange expertise in countering Russian drones, as they discussed the growing threat to Ukraine and NATO’s eastern flank.",
