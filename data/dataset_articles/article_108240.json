  "text": "Shmyhal, UK Defense Secretary discuss launch of Ukrainian drone production\nAccording to Ukrinform, Shmyhal reported this on Telegram.\n“During the meeting with John Healey in London, we discussed the practical implementation of the agreement. This is a significant step in realizing the 100-Year Partnership Agreement between Ukraine and the United Kingdom,” he said.\nShmyhal added that the agreement was signed with the UK Defense Secretary following arrangements between the President of Ukraine and the UK Prime Minister on developing industrial cooperation.\n“To start, the first thousand drones are planned to be produced — all of them will be delivered to Ukraine,” the minister noted.\nAccording to him, the interceptor drones have already proven effective against Russia’s Shahed terror attacks.\n“We will continue to scale these projects, attract investments, and improve technologies to protect Ukrainian cities and civilians as effectively as possible from Russian air attacks,” Shmyhal emphasized.\nThe minister added that the Ukrainian and British sides also reviewed outcomes of the UDCG meeting and coordinated issues for the next session, scheduled for October.\nUkrainian interceptor drones neutralize over 150 Russian targets in one night – Zelensky\nAs previously reported by Ukrinform, the UK will produce and jointly develop with Ukrainian industry the most advanced military equipment under a new technology-sharing agreement. Specifically, over the next 12 months, London plans to produce and deliver thousands of kamikaze drones to Ukraine.\nPhoto: Telegram / Denys Shmyhal",
