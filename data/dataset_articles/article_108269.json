The leaders aim to condemn the aggression and express unity with the Qatari government and people.\nPrime Minister Sharif has already arrived in Doha on a one-day visit, where he was received by Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense, Sheikh Saud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. He will meet Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss the attacks, regional peace, and Israel’s unprovoked aggression.\nAccompanying Prime Minister is a high-level Pakistani delegation, including Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi.\nThe arrival of the UAE and Saudi leaders underscores growing regional unity against recent threats, highlighting the close historical and fraternal ties among Pakistan, Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.\n[Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif in Doha after Israeli Strikes hit Qatar’s capital]",
