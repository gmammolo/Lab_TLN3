  "text": "MBDA launch AKERON MBT 120, an innovative solution for Main Battle Tanks launched missiles\n- Concept for a gun-launched non-line-of-sight (NLOS) missile for 120mm smoothbore tank guns\n- Innovation driven by response to learning from current global conflicts coupled with anticipating the future\n- Opportunity for an affordable capability at an accelerated pace and with scope for spiral development\nMBDA is taking the opportunity, at DSEI UK 2025, to launch AKERON MBT 120, an innovative solution to provide main battle tanks (MBTs) with an affordable NLOS complex weapon capability to increase efficiency and survivability.\nThe current global context has seen a return for the need for mass armour in high intensity warfighting with peer adversaries. Therefore, it is critical that platforms such as MBTs are able to fight differently, and for new capabilities to enable their evolution in this context.\nAKERON MBT 120 offers operators a fire-and-forget solution that matches dimensions of existing NATO 120mm rounds. This makes it suitable for the world's most popular tank guns and offers high loadout by utilising existing ammunition stowage with no change to platform signature.\nEric Beranger, CEO of MBDA, said: “It is pleasing to see our internal innovations transition to an offer for the global market. This latest addition to our AKERON family offers our customers a solution for rapid development to an initial capability, spirally developed to enhance the efficiency of their existing platforms in a new way. It demonstrates MBDA's ability to do something different in a rapidly evolving marketplace, and in a way that our customers can feel is cost-effective and will not increase logistic burdens.”\nThe concept is one of MBDA's very latest, driven by the Group's drive to 'Do Different' and accelerated by its own internal Innovation Awards, an initiative organised to celebrate the expertise that MBDA's people bring to every area of its business.\nThe missile leverages ITAR-free, commercial off the shelf components to enable accelerated development. Combined with AI-enabled targeting software, it can deliver a highly effective solution with no need for third party designation. The missile will increase lethality, survivability and reduce the requirement for artillery support, altogether optimising existing MBTs for the new realities of next-generation armoured combat.\nAKERON MBT 120 provides a 1-5km NLOS range using a passive seeker, boost rocket motor with low-smoke propellant, and an armour-defeating warhead. It bridges a space in MBDA's portfolio between solider/infantry-portable battlefield weapons such as ENFORCER and AKERON MP, and anti-tank overwatch capabilities such as Surface Launched BRIMSTONE.",
