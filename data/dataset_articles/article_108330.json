  "text": "WORLD\nPakistani security forces kill 19 pro-Indian militants in northwest ops PHOTO\nPakistani security forces have killed 19 militants from the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as “Khawarij,” during three separate operations in the country’s northwest this week, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).\nAccording to ISPR, acting on intelligence about the militants’ presence, security forces launched an operation in the Guluno area of the Momand district, Caliber.Az reports, citing Pakistani media.\nDuring the operation, forces attacked a militant hideout, neutralising 14 militants. The killed fighters were described as India-backed “Khawarij” actively involved in terrorist activities in the region.\nIn a second operation in Datta Khel (North Waziristan), four militants were killed, and one more was killed in a clash in the Bannu district.\nISPR stated that “clearing operations” continue to eliminate remaining militants in these areas, reaffirming that security forces are determined to eradicate terrorist violence in the country.\nBy Khagan Isayev",
