  "text": "Thu, Sep 11, 2025\nAirborne Tactical Advantage Company, a unit of Textron Systems, announced it has received a five-year contract with the U.S. Marine Corps to support ADAIR, or adversary air flight services for the Corps’ East coast flight training.\nThe ADAIR flight services contract was awarded under the Combat Air Force Combat Air Support II Multiple-Award IDIQ, or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. ATAC will provide critical support for F-35 training on the East coast with flights conducted from the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point in North Carolina and also MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina.\nThis new award will run from 2025 to 2030.\nThe Marine Corps has been a major customer of ATAC through their participation in Fighter Jet Services and Terminal Attack Controller Trainer contracts. However, this new contract is the first that is 100% dedicated to the USMC alone.\nATAC’s fleet of 60-some Dassault F1 Mirage fighters provide Mach 2 aerodynamic performance and has been upgraded to meet the Corps’ F-35 requirements. These include an active electronically scanned array radar and Link 16 solution, integrated through a mission computer with RedWEZ software to provide accurate threat replication.\nThe upgraded F1 aircraft have been in service at Luke Air Force Base and Fort Worth operating locations for several years and are a proven effective, reliable, and affordable solution to mount a challenge against Fifth-Gen aircraft.\nScott Stacy, Senior Vice President & General Manager of ATAC said, “We look forward to providing five years of high-quality, high-capability and cost-effective Adversary Air to the USMC’s MARFORCOM F-35 aircraft at MCAS Cherry Point and MCAS Beaufort.\n“As an industry leader in ADAIR flight services for F-35 training, ATAC is uniquely positioned to support the USMC and F-35 users globally in their training missions. The USMC has been a major user of our services on other contracts, and we are grateful for this opportunity to provide them with dedicated support.”\n©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n© 2007 - 2025 Web Development & Design by Pauli Systems, LC",
