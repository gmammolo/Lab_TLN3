  "text": "Badass US bomber drops 2,000-pound ship-sinking bomb, splitting vessel in two\nBeyond its nuclear-deterrence mission, the B-2’s long range and payload capacity have enabled it to deliver large munitions at a distance.\nA US Air Force’s B-2 bomber launched a 2,000-pound Quicksink bomb (left) to destroy a surface vessel under realistic conditions (right).\nThe US Air Force collaborated with Norwegian allies to test next-generation precision maritime strike capabilities on September 3 in the Norwegian Sea.\nThe joint exercise brought together the Air Force’s 53rd Wing, a US B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, and Royal Norwegian Air Force F-35 fighters and personnel.\nThe scenario focused on employing the Air Force Research Laboratory’s 2,000-pound Quicksink maritime weapon to destroy a surface vessel under realistic conditions, according to a US Air Force press release published on September 10.\nThe B-2’s torpedo\n“This test is a clear example of how we work with trusted allies to bring new capabilities into play faster and smarter,” Col. Scott Gunn, 53rd Wing commander, said in the Air Force press release.\n“We’re not just preparing for tomorrow; we’re shaping it together.”\nThe B-2 played a central role, using its stealth profile and long range to penetrate simulated defenses and release the precision-guided Quicksink munition.\nThe weapon is designed to give aircraft a “torpedo-like” effect from the air, allowing a single strike to break the keel of large ships, neutralize high-value vessels, or deny adversaries the use of sea lanes without relying on submarines.\nAir Force officials said the test confirmed the weapon’s performance and the bomber’s enduring ability to adapt to new maritime missions.\nIn addition to validating the munition’s destructive effect, the event underscored the importance of allied infrastructure and airspace.\nNorwegian support enabled US forces to access critical facilities and operate in a strategically significant, operationally challenging environment that closely mirrors northern maritime approaches to NATO territory.\nThe mission advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures for long-range sensor-to-shooter operations.\nAirmen practiced integrating beyond-line-of-sight communications and multi-domain targeting, essential for striking moving ships in heavily defended waters.\nQuicksink’s modular guidance system allows it to receive real-time targeting updates from aircraft, drones, or maritime sensors, giving commanders more flexibility to engage ships at range.\n“We are building readiness on both sides of the Atlantic and creating options that make maritime strike more distributed, survivable, and integrated,” Lt. Col. Stephen Bressett, commander of the 72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron, said.\n“We anticipate, adapt, and respond to what our senior leaders need at a speed relevant to our strategic environment; that’s what the 53rd Wing does best.”\nThe test also pushed forward the development of both large and small variants of the precision strike system, which is now under evaluation.\nAir Force officials said the smaller version would allow fighter jets such as the F-35 to carry multiple Quicksink rounds, expanding options for commanders to disrupt enemy fleets or logistics vessels from multiple platforms.\nQuicksink bomb that rips ships in half\nQuicksink, derived from the Joint Direct Attack Munition series of guidance kits, was developed to meet what the Air Force called “an urgent need to quickly neutralize maritime threats over massive expanses of ocean around the world.”\nThe weapon’s specialized seeker allows the use of Mark 80-series bombs for attacking ships. This helps solve the problem of having fewer precision-guided weapons in a big conflict against a strong enemy.\nThe Air Force first publicly demonstrated Quicksink in 2022 from an F-15E Strike Eagle, followed by sinking exercises during the Rim of the Pacific 2024 drills on two decommissioned amphibious ships.\nB-2 Spirit bombers conducted additional demonstrations against the former USS Dubuque (LPD-8) and USS Tarawa (LHA-1), showing the weapon’s effectiveness when launched from stealth platforms.\nBeyond its nuclear-deterrence mission, the B-2’s long range and payload capacity have enabled it to deliver large munitions at a distance.\nIn June, Missouri-based B-2 Spirits dropped 14 30,000-pound GBU-57 massive ordnance penetrators on Iranian nuclear sites during Operation Midnight Hammer, underscoring its versatility.\nThe Norwegian Sea test marks the Air Force’s latest effort to integrate anti-ship weaponry onto its aircraft to counter rising adversarial naval challenges.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\nIn January, the service also began eyeing the integration of AGM-158 Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles on its F-15E and EX fighters, according to Naval News.\nThe Air Force said its North Atlantic trials advanced the development of both large and small Quicksink variants.\nPhotos released by the service showed 2,000-pound GBU-31 and 500-pound GBU-38 bombs being prepared for the demonstration.\nQuicksink’s development comes as Beijing expands its naval presence in the Indo-Pacific.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nKapil Kajal Kapil Kajal is an award-winning journalist with a diverse portfolio spanning defense, politics, technology, crime, environment, human rights, and foreign policy.
