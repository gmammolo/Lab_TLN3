  "text": "European Parliament calls for recognition of Palestine\nThe EU Assembly voted in favor of a non-binding resolution, agreed by the center-majority groups.\nThe European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on EU member states to \"consider recognizing the State of Palestine, with a view to achieving a two-state solution.\"\nWhile Parliament has supported \"recognition in principle of Palestinian statehood\" in the past, this new resolution appears to be a more direct call for national governments to act.\nThe resolution was approved with 305 votes in favor, 151 against and 122 abstentions.\nAccording to Italian Socialist MEP Nicola Zingaretti, this was the result of thorough negotiations between political groups on various amendments.\nThe vote was long and tense, and members of Parliament even requested a pause to check the votes on the amendments on Gaza, before continuing with the final vote on the resolution as a whole.\nAnother controversial point in the resolution was the use of the term \"genocide\" to describe Israel's attacks on Gaza.\nThe wording \"genocidal acts\" was ultimately rejected and excluded from the text. /Telegraph/",
