  "text": "HCMC – Vietnam and Turkey will step up defense collaboration, with a focus on training, naval and air force ties, cybersecurity, and defense industry. General Phan Van Giang, Minister of National Defense, held talks with Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler in Hanoi on September 11.\nGeneral Phan Van Giang said bilateral defense cooperation had achieved many positive results in recent years, notably in training, defense industry, military trade, and participation in United Nations peacekeeping.\nHe proposed that the two sides continue to promote exchanges at all levels, strengthen cooperation in training, defense industry, and peacekeeping, and support each other in multilateral mechanisms and forums.\nGiang also expressed his wish for Vietnam and Turkey to explore cooperation and exchange experiences in naval and air force operations, cybersecurity, responses to non-conventional security challenges, engineering, and mine clearance.\nHe thanked Minister Yasar Guler for sending a delegation of 11 defense industry companies to the Vietnam International Defense Expo 2024 and affirmed that Vietnam is ready to welcome Turkish enterprises to future exhibitions.\nSpeaking at the talks, Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler emphasized that Vietnam is an important partner of Turkey in the Asia-Pacific region.\nYasar Guler expressed his desire to promote multi-faceted cooperation between the two countries, including in defense, and said he believed this visit would make an important contribution to the development of bilateral relations.\nMinister Guler added that Turkey would continue to send officers to study Vietnamese at the Military Science Academy, while also welcoming Vietnamese cadets and officers to take part in training programs in Turkey.",
