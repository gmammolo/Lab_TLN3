  "text": "Australians en route to Gaza say they are undeterred from their humanitarian \"mission\" after activists allege two ships were attacked by what they suspect were drones in as many days.\nAll passengers and crew on board the British-flagged Alma , which is part of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), were unharmed after the alleged attack that occurred off the coast of Tunisia, organisers said in a statement early on Wednesday. They said the vessel had sustained to its top deck and an investigation was underway.\nThat came a day after the GSF alleged the Portuguese-flagged \"Family boat\" had also been hit by a drone while also anchored off the port of Sidi Bou Said. No one was hurt, organisers said.\nFollowing the second incident, Tunisia's interior ministry launched said an investigation had been launched after what it described \"premeditated aggression\" attack. Authorities had previously cast doubt following the first alleged attack, with Tunisian national guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli saying \"no drones have been detected\".\nIsla Lamont, a 24-year-old northern NSW resident, was on night watch on the Alma vessel when the second alleged attack occurred.\nHer mother, Julie Lamont, who is also part of the flotilla, told SBS News she was \"terrified\" when she heard the news.\n\"We're remaining steadfast in our resolve to set sail and do what our governments are failing to do. There's a certain level of kind of putting ourselves on the line,\" Juliet Lamont said.\n\"We don't have any weapons on board. All we have is, like baby food and medicine and other aid, and nobody will react violently,\" Juliet Lamont said.\nSeveral vessels, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, off the coast of Tunisia. Source: AAP, EPA / Mohamed Messara SBS News understand there are 10 Australians involved in the GSF, which describes itself as an independent group not linked to any government or political party. High-profile climate activist Greta Thunberg is part of the mission, which aims to break Israel's naval blockade and deliver aid to Gaza, parts of which are suffering from famine, according to the United Nations-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Famine Review Committee. Israel has dismissed the findings as false and biased.\nThe blockade has remained in place through the current war , which began on 7 October 2023 when Hamas — the political and military group that rules Gaza — attacked southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\nIsrael's subsequent military assault against Hamas has killed over 64,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health ministry says, and has plunged the enclave into a deep humanitarian crisis.\nIsrael sealed off Gaza by land in early March, letting in no supplies for three months, leading to the widespread shortage of food. It accused Hamas of stealing aid for its own fighters or to sell to finance its operations, an accusation Hamas denies .\nThe European Commission, as well as an internal US government analysis, has also previously indicated that there is no evidence of systematic theft of humanitarian supplies by Hamas.\nAbout 50 boats are part of the flotilla, and Juliet's other daughter, 26-year-old Luca, is on another of the vessels.\n\"We as a family just thought that we had to do something. And so there are flotillas that are going to continue to try and create a humanitarian corridor and show the world and put pressure on the governments to stop this genocide,\" Juliet Lamont said.\n\"It might be foolhardy, but it feels like the right and moral thing to do.\"\nIsrael has in the past strongly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as self-defence.\nIt is fighting a case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that accuses it of genocide — allegations Israel flatly rejects, insisting it is attempting to obliterate Hamas, which it says is operating among Palestinian civilians.\nJuliet Lamont's daughter Luca (left) with climate activist Greta Thunberg. They are all part of the Global Sumud Flotilla. Credit: Supplied Another Australian activist, Abubakir Rafiq was on board the boat that was hit in the first alleged attack.\nHe said he is \"safe and fine\".\n\"It's been an exhausting past two days ... but nothing is going to stop us, nothing is going to slow us down,\" he said in a video on his Instagram account.\n\"We will continue our mission; we will reach the shore of Gaza.\"\nTony La Piccirella, an Italian citizen also on board \"the Family\", said people on board the flotilla have taken risks.\n\"Anyone who has embarked on this journey has taken the risks and has already accepted them, because they are driven by motivation and solidarity for the Palestinian people, aware of the fact that right now, anyone who is Palestinian and lives in Palestinian territory is risking much more simply by existing,\" he told SBS Italian.\nREAD MORE Emaciation, miscarriages and death: An eyewitness account of starvation in Gaza\nThe flotilla arrived in Tunisia from Spain on Sunday. The flotilla was to resume its voyage on Wednesday, but was delayed yet again due to weather conditions.\nSaif Abukeshek, a spokesperson for the GSF, blamed Israel for the first alleged attack, saying there is \"no other authority that would do such ... a crime\".\nSBS News contacted the Israel Defense Forces for comment.\nAustralia's Department of Foreign Affairs and trade said it was aware of both alleged drone attacks.\n\"We stand ready to offer consular assistance to any Australian citizen, should it be requested,\" a DFAT spokesperson said in a statement.\nIn June, Israeli naval forces boarded and seized a British-flagged yacht carrying Thunberg , among others. Israel dismissed the aid ship as a propaganda stunt in support of Hamas.\nAnd in July, another boat carrying 21 activists, including two Australians — Tan Safi and Robert Martin — was intercepted by Israeli forces. They were detained and deported.",
