  "text": "The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies killed four key terrorists linked to Fitna al-Hindustan during a joint operation in Balochistan’s Pishin district.\nAccording to a CTD spokesperson, the operation was launched on the basis of secret intelligence, leading to a heavy exchange of fire with the militants.\nThe spokesperson added that the slain terrorists were involved in several major crimes in the province, including an attack on a Frontier Corps truck on Chaman Road, the killing of a Levies officer in Pishin, and multiple assaults on police personnel.\nRecovered weapons included 2 kalashnikov rifles, 2 nine-millimeter pistols, 2 hand grenades, a detonator, a primer card, and other explosive materials. All these items were part of the terrorists’ preparations for further attacks.\nThe CTD spokesperson stated that this operation is part of ongoing efforts to restore peace and security in Balochistan. The identities of the killed terrorists are being verified, and their bodies have been transferred to a hospital for post-mortem.\nLaw enforcement agencies have also launched a search operation in the area to apprehend any possible accomplices. Operations against terrorism in Balochistan will continue, and intelligence agencies remain committed to restoring peace.\nThe spokesperson urged the public to immediately report any suspicious activities to authorities to help maintain security in the province.\nSource: Dunya News",
