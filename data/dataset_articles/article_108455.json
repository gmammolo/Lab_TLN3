  "text": "Czechia to buy 44 Leopard 2A8 tanks in CZK 34 billion deal\nCzechia’s Ministry of Defense has signed a contract to purchase 44 German Leopard 2A8 tanks, including command and combat models, for CZK 34.25 billion, including VAT. The deal also covers modifications for Czech army requirements, with an additional CZK 5 billion set aside for inflation and currency adjustments. Deliveries are expected from 2028 through 2031.\nThe purchase joins a German framework agreement with the manufacturer KNDS, which reduces unit costs. The government had announced last June its plan to acquire up to 77 tanks in six versions for CZK 52.1 billion.\nThe first phase includes logistics support, spare parts, training, and protective systems, with CZK 1.49 billion allocated to adapt the tanks for Czech use.",
