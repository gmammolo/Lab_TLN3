  "title": "DSEI 2025: Saab's New Nimbrix C-UAS Missile",
  "text": "At the end of August, Saab unveiled their new counter-unmanned aerial system (C-UAS) missile – it was showcased at London’s DSEI 2025 this week. Designed as a one-shot, one-kill answer to the increasing threats of one-way munitions, reconnaissance UAS and potential drone swarms.\nNimbrix has a range of up to 5km using an active seeker to track its targets. Its warhead can effectively engage and defeat UAS swarms using an air-burst mode. It has a weight of between 2.5 and 3kg and is positioned as a cost-effective answer to low-cost drone threats.\nArtist’s render Nimbrix in action (Saab)\nSaab note that the missile operates as a ground-based system and can be operated independently or as an integrated part of a larger air defense system. Flexible mounting options are available to fit different customers’ requirements, Nimbrix launchers can be mounted on various vehicles or in fixed configurations. The small missile’s cost-effective design seeks to maximise the deployed numbers to ensure sufficient air defense coverage around key infrastructure and manoeuvre units.\nIn their announcement of the new Nimbrix missile, Stefan Öberg, head of Saab’s Missile Systems business unit said: “Nimbrix is our answer to the unmanned aerial threats which have escalated in the last few years. It is cost-effective which is critical given the proliferation of UASs on the battlefield. Nimbrix benefits from our long experience of air defence, together with an agile way of responding to new needs.”\nAs part of an integrated air defense system Nimbrix could be paired with data gathering systems such as radar like Saab’s Giraffe 1X and other sensor inputs feeding into a command and control system which then tasks effectors like Nimbrix.\nSaab Nimbrix at DSEI 2025 (Matt Moss) Nimbrix is planned to be scaleable and is still being refined with various options for motors and seekers considered. Saab note that the small missiles can be mounted on other ground-based C-UAS systems like the Trackfire remote weapon system.",
