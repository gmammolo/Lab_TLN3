  "text": "Sweden has allocated the 20th military aid package to Ukraine for $836 million.\nThis was reported by Swedish Defense Minister Poul Johnson on September 11.\nThe new military aid package includes:\n- 18 new “Archer” self-propelled artillery systems. In total, Ukraine will have 44 such self-propelled artillery systems;\n- 155 mm ammunition;\n- mobile coastal radar systems, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and unmanned maritime systems. The total amount of equipment in the maritime sector will reach $190 million;\n- additional weapons, equipment, and radars for 32 combat boats previously transferred to Ukraine;\n- 500 motorcycles and support equipment for air bases, including trucks and tractors, with a total value of $12.7 million;\n- radar sensors and control systems for “Tridon” Mk 2 anti-aircraft systems, which Ukraine received earlier;\n- programmable 40 mm anti-aircraft ammunition.\nSwedish Defense Minister Poul Johnson noted that, in addition to all of the above, the new military assistance package includes $68 million for contributions to various international coalitions assisting Ukraine.\nAnd the aid package also includes “additional secret systems and projects”. According to him, the Russian army can expect Swedish-Ukrainian surprises in the future.\n- The Archer self-propelled gun with a 155 mm gun is called an icon of artillery systems. It has an automatic loading system and digital target guidance. It takes 3.5 minutes to fire a full ammunition load of 21 shells.\n- TRIDON Mk2 is a Swedish anti-aircraft system\ncapable ofcombating virtually all threats on the battlefield: from drones and cruise missiles to enemy aircraft and armored vehicles, creating security and protection for both military forces and civilian infrastructure.\nFor more news and in-depth stories from Ukraine, please follow us on X.",
