  "text": "More than a century after they helped break down color barriers by fighting valiantly on the battlefields of World War I, the storied Harlem Hellfighters on Wednesday received the highest civilian award given by the U.S. Congress.\nAt a ceremony on Capitol Hill, lawmakers officially awarded the unit the Congressional Gold Medal.\n“They were brave, bold, and beguiling patriots who loved America, even when America didn’t show the same love to them,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said at the afternoon ceremony.\nWhat You Need To Know More than a century after WWI, Congess awarded the Harlem Hellfighters the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony Wednesday\nAs an all-Black unit, the Hellfighters faced discrimination among the American ranks, but they would quickly prove themselves, shattering racist stereotypes and spending 191 days in the front line trenches Though they received a hero’s welcome when they arrived home, they also returned to a country still steeped in segregation\nRep. Tom Suozzi spearheaded the effort to recognize them with the medal When the U.S. joined World War I, the New York National Guard’s 15th Infantry Regiment (later the 369th Infantry Regiment) was among the first to deploy to Europe.\nBut, as an all-Black unit, they faced discrimination among the American ranks, and instead ended up under French command, fighting with French equipment.\nThey would quickly prove themselves, shattering racist stereotypes. They spent more time in continuous combat than any other unit of their size, with 191 days on the front lines, according to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture .\nThey suffered 1,400 casualties — more than any other unit.\n“They fought with such determination that our French allies called them the Men of Bronze. And even their German adversaries gave them the moniker Harlem Hellfighters,” New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said.\nThough they received a hero’s welcome when they arrived home, they also returned to a country still steeped in segregation. Their heroics would eventually fade from memory.\nRep. Tom Suozzi spearheaded the effort to recognize them with the Congressional Gold Medal.\n“Finally, we are here today to say with one voice to the Harlem Hellfighters: ‘Thank you, you will never be forgotten,’” he said.\nThat is a pledge and promise welcomed by the descendants of the courageous unit, who have long fought to see the names of their loved ones etched in history.\n“They sacrificed and they thought they were making a difference, and today proves that they did,” said Debra Willet, granddaughter of Harlem Hellfighter Sergeant Leander Willet.\nSgt. Henry Johnson (Courtesy of the New York National Guard) As lawmakers shared stories of the Harlem Hellfighters’ bravery, one name in particular came up time and time again at Wednesday’s ceremony: Sgt. Henry Johnson.\nIn 1918, Johnson, a slight man from Albany, single-handedly fought off several enemy German attackers, repelling them using a bolo knife and saving a fellow soldier from capture while suffering severe wounds.\nJohnson's battlefield heroics during the Battle of the Argonne Forest led Theodore Roosevelt to call him one of the five bravest American soldiers of the war. He became one of the first Americans to be awarded the French Croix de Guerre avec Palme, France's highest award for valor, before dying in July 1929. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer led a two-year struggle to posthumously honor Johnson with a Medal of Honor, America's highest award for valor — an effort that came to fruition when Johnson was honored in a 2015 White House ceremony.\nEight years later, the U.S. renamed Fort Polk in Louisiana after the soldier from Albany, naming it Fort Johnson.\nBut under President Donald Trump's leadership, the Army announced in June Fort Johnson was being changed to Fort Polk.\n\"I was also proud when it was announced that they would be renaming Fort Polk to Fort Johnson in his honor,\" Schumer said Wednesday. \"And while that decision was reversed earlier this year, I hope today shows what a mistake that was. And why a base deserves to bear the name of one of Harlem Hellfighters' finest.\"",
