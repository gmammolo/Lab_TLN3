  "text": "World’s first 9-ton railgun fires 20-megajoule blast at Mach 7 to smash missiles\nIn earlier tests, the weapon reached a muzzle velocity of about 2,230 meters per second, or Mach 6.5.\nWorld’s first 9-ton hypersonic railgun fires 20-megajoule blast to smash missiles.\nJapan has released new images of its ship-mounted railgun firing from the test ship JS Asuka on September 10, marking a milestone in the country’s push to develop directed-energy weapons for the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nThe Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency (ATLA), an arm of the Defense Ministry that manages research, procurement, and technology support, said it conducted the shipboard railgun test from June to early July with support from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\nIt was the first time Japan had shown images of the railgun in action while mounted on a real vessel.\nWorld’s first 20-megajoule giant railgun\nThe Fleet Research and Development Command operates the ship as a technology demonstrator.\nATLA has overseen the program with industrial support from Japan Steel Works, one of the nation’s premier naval gun manufacturers.\nJapan formally launched its electromagnetic railgun effort in 2016 and began live-fire testing in 2022.\nEarly research focused on two technical hurdles that have stymied similar programs abroad: keeping projectiles stable at hypersonic speeds and reducing barrel wear caused by extreme stresses.\nSeptember 10, 2025\nRailguns accelerate projectiles with electric and magnetic fields, producing immense forces that can rapidly degrade internal components.\nThe US Navy canceled its publicly acknowledged railgun project in 2021 after spending more than $500 million.\nAccording to Defense News, the American prototype suffered severe barrel degradation after fewer than 30 firings, prompting Washington to shift its public emphasis toward solid-state laser systems.\nThose weapons have faced inconsistent field performance and limited operational readiness.\n7x speed of sound\nJapan’s current railgun prototype, mounted on Asuka, reportedly weighs about eight metric tons (nine US tons) and has a six-meter barrel.\nOpen-source analysis cited by Shephard Media indicates the system launches 40-millimeter steel projectiles weighing roughly 320 grams (0.7 pounds).\nIn earlier tests, the weapon reached a muzzle velocity of about 2,230 meters per second, or Mach 6.5, and planners aim to boost its charge energy from 5 megajoules to a projected 20 megajoules.\nUnlike traditional explosive ordnance, the railgun relies on pure kinetic energy for destructive effect, firing inert projectiles at hypersonic speed.\nThis makes it a cost-effective alternative to guided missiles in certain roles. Concept diagrams suggest projectiles could be configured for multiple missions, including anti-air fragmentation.\nRailguns also avoid the line-of-sight limits and atmospheric attenuation that hinder laser weapons, offering all-weather capability and potential over-the-horizon engagements, a significant advantage at sea.\nJapanese defense planners have studied pairing railguns with long-range intercept systems to strengthen layered air defense against threats such as hypersonic glide vehicles and massed drone swarms.\nThe Red Sea confrontations, where expensive interceptors have been used against low-cost drones, have underscored the economic challenges of missile-centric defenses.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\nRailguns have the potential to hold more ammunition and cost less per shot. These factors could change how we approach warfare that relies on a steady supply and attrition.\nJapan is making important strides in energy-based weaponry, an area that has long promised much but has not delivered. However, it is now getting closer to being ready for actual use.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nKapil Kajal Kapil Kajal is an award-winning journalist with a diverse portfolio spanning defense, politics, technology, crime, environment, human rights, and foreign policy.
