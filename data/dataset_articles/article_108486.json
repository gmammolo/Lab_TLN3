  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nNovator Production Hits Milestone as Ukraine Receives Over 1,000 Armored Vehicles\nUkrainian defense company Ukrainian Armor has delivered more than 1,000 Novator armored vehicles to the Armed Forces since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the company’s press service announced on September 10.\nOver the past three years, the Novator line has expanded with several new variants. These include the Novator-2, the Novator-2S medical evacuation vehicle, the Novator command-and-staff vehicle, an EOD operations vehicle, and a reinforced-protection Novator.\nIn early September 2025, Ukrainian Armor also unveiled the Novator-2 Krechet at the MSPO defense exhibition in Poland. The new model is a command-and-staff platform designed to coordinate air defense systems.\nThe upgraded Novator-2 was first introduced last year in a 10-seat version, developed in response to requests from frontline troops for a larger-capacity vehicle.\nKey improvements include a fully armored rear section with 5 cm-thick windows, additional mine-resistant seating, and a rear hatch that can be used both for evacuation and as an extra firing point.\nTo handle the extra mass, engineers reinforced both the front and rear axles, added new suspension components, installed rear leaf springs, fitted dual shock absorbers, and equipped each side with pneumatic cylinders—allowing crews to adjust suspension and ground clearance based on load.\nThe protection level remains consistent with the previous model: resistance to 7.62 mm rounds, a V-shaped hull designed to withstand the simultaneous detonation of two RGD-5 grenades, and armored glass that has, in some cases, stopped .50 caliber (12.7 mm) fire.\nThe Novator-2 can also be fitted with a rotating platform for heavy weapons, including 12.7 mm machine guns or even automatic grenade launchers. To counter FPV drone threats, Ukrainian Armor has announced plans to integrate dome-shaped electronic warfare systems for added protection.\nCompany director Vladyslav Belbas said in March that Ukrainian Armor would increase Novator production by 50% this year compared to 2024, with the long-term goal of doubling annual output.\nEarlier, the Ukrainian-made “Varta-2” armored vehicle was officially approved for deployment by the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nDeveloped by the company Ukrainian Armor, the vehicle offers both enhanced crew protection and, if required, significant firepower support on the battlefield.",
