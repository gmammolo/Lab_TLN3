  "text": "- Category\nLatest news\nUkraine Launches Joint Venture in Poland to Train Operators Against Shahed Drones\nUkrainian Dronarium Academy and Gnizdo Ltd have announced a joint venture, Ptaki Dronarium ([dronariumbirds.pl]), which will open training centres in Poland to prepare operators of various unmanned systems—including drones—with particular focus on countering Russian “Shahed” suicide drones, according to Militarnyi on September 11.\nThe program will provide instruction on:\nFPV drones;\nmultirotor and fixed-wing systems;\ninterceptor drones aimed at neutralizing Shahed-type threats;\nground robotic platforms;\nunderwater drones;\nand other types of unmanned systems.\nThe founder of Dronarium Group, Ruslan Belyaev, explained that the interceptor-drone operator training course will last about one month, depending on the student’s starting skill level.\nHe noted that bureaucratic procedures are nearly complete and the official launch of Ptaki Dronarium is planned in roughly 20 days. Already, about 700 people have signed up or been whitelisted for different programmes, from FPV and multirotor to interceptor and other unmanned systems.\nThe timing of the launch is directly related to recent incidents: on September 10, 2025, Russian drones violated Polish airspace, damaging a civilian home. Organizers said that this made the threat “real rather than hypothetical.”\nDronarium Academy describes itself as a defense-technology training and R&D platform that trains operators of aerial, ground, and underwater unmanned systems for the Ukrainian armed forces and international partners.\nGnizdo Ltd is a Ukrainian association of military and civilian UAV operators, focused on advancing drone piloting skills, sharing experience, and raising professional readiness.\nEarlier, it was reported that Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy offered Poland help building an early-warning and air-defense system after Russian drones crossed into Polish territory, noting evidence the intrusion was not accidental.",
