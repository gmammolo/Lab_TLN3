  "text": "Gold and silver continue to trade higher this week, receiving another boost today from new geopolitical concerns.\nPoland fired shots at 19 Russian drones claimed to have violated Polish airspace...\n...and it invoked Article 4 of NATO, seeking emergency consultation with other NATO members.\nPoland's prime minister today warned the prospect of military conflict in Europe is \"closer than at any time since the Second World War.\"\nAt the same time, Trump is floating 100% tariffs on India and China to pressure Russia over Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, a U.S. District Court temporarily blocked Trump's firing of Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who stands accused of mortgage fraud. And the market is certain the Fed will reduce interest rates next week -- possibly by even 50 basis points.\nIndeed, the case for having personal exposure to physical gold and silver is as strong as ever, but Americans are mostly sitting out the precious metals market so far.\nRetail demand has picked up over the past two weeks, but selling and profit-taking continue. It may take silver breaking above $50 before the American public jumps on board.\nPremiums on coins, bars, and rounds are at 6-year lows -- thanks to the high degree of retail selling and the glut of inventory in the U.S. dealer market. That spells opportunity for those who are actually accumulating gold and silver.",
