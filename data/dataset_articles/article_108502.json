  "text": "The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA), together with representatives of the Polish-American community, have urged NATO and the European Union to take decisive action following the Russian drone incursion into Poland on the night of Sept. 9–10.\n“This marked a dangerous escalation not just against Ukraine, but against NATO’s eastern flank and international law,” the UCCA said.\nThe organization emphasized the need to strengthen sanctions against Russia, increase humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, and bolster defenses along NATO’s eastern borders.\n“We stand united in defense of freedom, sovereignty, and peace,” the UCCA said.\nThe statement follows an incursion of nearly two dozen Russia drones into Polish territory overnight on Sept. 10. Polish jet fighters and other NATO aircraft were scrambled, with four reportedly shot down. At the end of the day, 12 Russian drones were found on Polish territory, presumably from electronic jamming and as far as the northern port of Gdansk.\nThe Russian provocation against Poland, which triggered NATO’s Article 4 consultations among member states, demonstrates that Russia’s aggression poses a threat to global security, the organization said.\n“This can’t go unpunished. Appeasement of dictators has never worked. The time to punish Russia is now,” the UCCA said.\nEarlier, the Ukrainian World Congress unequivocally condemned the latest unprovoked drone incursions. This is nothing short of an act of aggression not only against a sovereign nation, but against the NATO alliance itself.\nThe UWC calls on NATO and the international community to respond swiftly and decisively.\nCover: the Facebook account Nocna Jazda Tomaszów Mazowiecki",
