  "text": "Living History Day is FREE and OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.\nWWI Living History Day gives the public a chance to learn what it was like to be an American Doughboy during World War I. Through interactions with living historians, displays featuring original vehicles and equipment worn by soldiers, presentations, and musical concerts, attendees can get a glimpse into the era.\n“Combining a symposium with prominent authors and historians, along with living history, is a great way to bring together educational resources while also honoring the birthday of General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces. Presented at the National WWI Memorial, the public will also have the opportunity to visit the new memorial, which features the 60-foot sculpture, “Soldier's Journey” – Jari Villanueva, Executive Director, The Doughboy Foundation\nThe educational and informative Inaugural WW1 Symposium along with the one-day Living History display is sponsored and presented by The Doughboy Foundation to benefit its work in support of America’s National World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. The symposium is also presented by the MacArthur Memorial, which is a museum and research center dedicated to preserving and presenting the story of the life of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur.\nCONTACT\nNearby Favorites\nGreat Big Game Show\nPlay a variety of classic TV game show mini-games to rack up points in...\nSPONSORED",
