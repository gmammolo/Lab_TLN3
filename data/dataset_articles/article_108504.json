  "text": "Sweden adopts Polish Piorun MANPADS to give infantry rapid response against drones and helicopters.\nAccording to statements from the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration and a parallel announcement from Polish manufacturer Mesko, Sweden has signed a main order for the Piorun man portable air defence system worth roughly 274 millions euros. The contract follows a letter of intent earlier this year and a smaller bridging order, and officials indicate first units are planned to enter service from early 2026 with deliveries running into 2027. The choice says a lot about what Stockholm wants right now. It is not a bespoke, decade long development. It is a field proven, soldier carried heat seeking missile designed to swat drones, helicopters and low flying aircraft inside the last few kilometres over troops and critical sites.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link\nThe Piorun MANPADS, developed by Poland’s Mesko, is a shoulder-fired missile system capable of engaging drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft at ranges up to 6.5 km (Picture source: Mesko).\nPiorun is a compact package built around a single stage solid fuel missile fired from a disposable launch tube clipped to a reusable gripstock. The round is about 1.6 metres long with a 72 mm diameter body and a fragmentation warhead just under two kilograms. It is guided by a cooled infrared seeker and armed with both impact and proximity fuzes. That last detail matters in practice. A near miss against a small quadcopter or a lightweight fixed wing UAV still throws enough fragments to disable it, and those are the targets that tend to slip through traditional point defence. The engagement envelope is quoted out to around 6.5 kilometres depending on conditions, with shots possible from a few hundred metres up to roughly four thousand metres in altitude, which puts it squarely in the very short range air defence tier.\nThe ergonomic design is built for conscripts, reservists and line infantry. The battery and coolant are carried within each sealed round, so every missile arrives with its own consumables and the launcher stays simple. The standard sighting setup combines a day sight with a clip on thermal viewer, allowing the same drills in daylight and at night. Total system weight sits is about few kilograms, light enough for one operator to carry with a teammate hauling spare rounds. Reaction sequence is familiar to anyone who has trained on shoulder fired heat seekers: acquire, uncage, lock, fire, then move. The passive seeker means the shooter does not broadcast a guidance beam, which reduces warning for the target and keeps the team harder to find in the moments that matter.\nFor the Swedish Army, Piorun will sit alongside, not replace, existing ground based air defence. Sweden has long experience with the RBS 70 family, a laser beam riding system operated from a tripod with excellent precision when the operator has a steady position and clear line of sight. Piorun is deliberately different. It hunts heat rather than riding a laser, it can be fired from a doorway or treeline, and it is quick to set up. In a mixed unit, the two approaches complement each other. RBS 70 NG can service targets at longer ranges when cued and emplaced, while Piorun spreads air denial down to platoons and patrols that do not have the time or terrain for a tripod and full kit. That breadth is important as Sweden reconstitutes and expands ground formations after years of leaner structures.\nPiorun has been used extensively in Ukraine, where low altitude threats are constant and varied. The missile has been credited with engagements against helicopters and aircraft, but perhaps more importantly, it has seen daily use against drones of all sizes. That is the type of target mix European armies face near supply nodes, bridges and staging areas. A shoulder launched weapon that can be taught quickly, kept on vehicles or carried on foot, and fired from awkward positions plugs real holes close to the ground. In training, commanders typically distribute several teams across a frontage and, when available, pair them with vehicle mounted guns or a lightweight radar cue to thicken the bubble. The logic is straightforward. Many small sticks complicate route planning for enemy reconnaissance drones and force manned rotary pilots to climb or detour, which buys time. Minimum range performance and low altitude coverage make the system useful for close protection of depots, temporary command posts and refuelling points where drones approach along odd angles and rooftop heights. The proximity fuze reduces the number of frustrating near misses. The passive seeker keeps the team’s profile low.\nThere is also an industrial and doctrinal thread running through the decision. Sweden is deepening its layers of air defence in the first full year of NATO membership, and that means filling the very short range tier with something available, reasonably priced, and interoperable with partners. A Polish made missile with rising European adoption fits that bill. Common stocks and shared training reduce friction on multinational exercises in the Baltic and the High North. The delivery tempo Sweden has outlined, with initial operational use planned for early 2026 and completion in 2027, signals urgency and a desire to field capability on a schedule measured in quarters rather than decades. That aligns with the broader push to harden bases, ports and maneuver corridors that alliance planners will rely on in a crisis.\nRussian forces have normalised the use of drones and cruise missiles to pressure logistics hubs and civilian infrastructure, while probing air defences with cheap platforms to map where the gaps are. For a frontline NATO state on the Baltic approaches, the answer is not one silver bullet, but layers. Long and medium range systems create standoff. Gun and missile short range systems protect fixed sites. Very short range, shoulder fired weapons like Piorun live where soldiers actually are, in forests, streets and along railheads. They make the last few hundred metres expensive. The fact that Sweden is buying now, and at scale, is a practical message to partners and to Moscow alike. It ties Stockholm more tightly into the northern European air defence web and, quietly, it raises the cost of low altitude intrusion over Swedish ground forces.\nWritten by Evan Lerouvillois, Defense Analyst, Army Recognition Group.\nEvan studied International Relations, and quickly specialized in defense and security.
