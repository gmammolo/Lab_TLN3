  "text": "AeroVironment (AV) has successfully completed the first air-launch of its Switchblade 600 loitering munition system (LMS) from an MQ-9A Reaper uncrewed aircraft system (UAS).\nAV partnered with General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) for the week-long flight test.\nDiscover B2B Marketing That Performs\nCombine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms.\nThe event demonstrated the Switchblade 600’s ability to integrate with the MQ-9A platform.\nThe tests culminated in two successful launches, demonstrating “precise targeting” and the capacity for “real-time data” transmission, which included “updated guidance, navigation, control systems, and payload integrations”.\nThe collaboratively launched Switchblade 600 enhances multi-domain operations by delivering over-the-horizon strike capabilities from extended distances, said the company.\nWhen launched from an altitude of 30,000 MSL with advanced communication protocols, the system has the potential to travel beyond 175km.\nUS Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?\nDon’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.\nBy GlobalDataIn addition, the tests underscored improved satellite communication (SATCOM) features that facilitate launch, control, and engagement of the LMS.\nAeroVironment said its Switchblade systems are already operationally deployed across multiple combat theatres by various customers.\nThe new integration with the MQ-9A augments mission capabilities and promotes interoperability between air and ground forces while enhancing support for ground manoeuvre operations, stated the company.\nAV chairman, president and chief executive officer Wahid Nawabi said: “This successful demonstration is the result of close coordination, technical rigor, and shared commitment across teams. We appreciate the strong collaboration with GA-ASI in achieving this integration milestone.\n“The ability to air launch and control Switchblade 600 from the MQ-9A UAS platform via SATCOM highlights the system’s adaptability and operational maturity—reinforcing our commitment to delivering advanced capabilities in direct support of the warfighter.”\nIn May 2025, the Netherlands Ministry of Defence awarded a contract to AeroVironment to modernise its Puma 3 All Environment UAS fleet for enhanced capabilities.",
