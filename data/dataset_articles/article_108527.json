  "text": "NOVOROSSIYSK, Russia – Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence ( GUR ) announced on September 10 that it had successfully disabled a Russian Black Sea Fleet vessel near Novorossiysk.\nUkrainian Drones Strike Key Russian Naval Asset A costly Russian ship has been rendered inoperable following a Ukrainian drone attack near Novorossiysk. The GUR claims the vessel, likely the “Savior Demidov,” is an expensive, multi-functional emergency rescue ship.\nUkraine’s intelligence service says it attacked a valuable Russian ship on September 10.\nUkraine’s intelligence agency reported a ship from Russia’s Black Sea Fleet was hit on September 10. The targeted vessel is identified as a high-value, multi-functional emergency rescue ship. Its cost is estimated at $60 million, with Russia possessing only four such ships. The attack reportedly disabled the ship’s radio electronic reconnaissance equipment. What was the target of the Ukrainian intelligence attack? The GUR struck a Russian ship of the MPSV07 project, a multi-functional emergency vessel.\nThese specialized ships are crucial for operations like search and rescue, containing oil spills, deploying boats and diving gear, and underwater surveys. The GUR highlighted that such a vessel costs approximately $60 million and that Russia has a limited fleet of only four.\nDuring the GUR special forces operation, the targeted Russian ship was engaged in radio electronic reconnaissance. It was also patrolling the approaches to Novorossiysk Bay at the time of the attack.\nThe GUR’s special forces utilized a drone of Ukrainian manufacture to strike the vessel. The attack focused on the vessel’s management bridge, a critical area housing navigation and communication equipment. The agency stated that the attack successfully destroyed the radio electronic reconnaissance equipment, “disabling the ship for expensive repairs.”",
