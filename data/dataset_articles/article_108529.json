  "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russian authorities said on Thursday thay had reopened the main airport in Krasnodar, one of the largest cities in southern Russia, for the first time since flights were suspended for security reasons in 2022 after the start of the war in Ukraine.\nThe transport ministry said it had resolved outstanding security issues and that the reopening should help local residents and businesses and also provide access to holiday resorts along the Black Sea and Azov Sea coast.\nRosaviatsiya, the aviation watchdog, said Krasnodar airport, which has been overhauled, was expected to receive its first regular flight from Moscow on September 17 when an Aeroflot passenger plane was due to land.\nThe airport has not accepted flights since the end of February 2022, when Russia, after sending its troops into Ukraine, closed at least 10 airports for security reasons.\nRussia resumed operations at Gelendzhik airport, also in the south, in July 2025, and at Elista airport, in the Kalmykia region, in May 2024.\n(Reporting by ReutersEditing by Andrew Osborn)\n© Reuters - 2025",
