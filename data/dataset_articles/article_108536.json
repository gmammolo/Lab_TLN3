  "text": "The Power of Unity. Flags and hardware Active preparations for the military parade have begun in Serbia\nThe Power of Unity\nFlags and hardware\nActive preparations for the military parade have begun in Serbia. It is scheduled for September 20 and is timed to coincide with the Day of Serbian Unity, Freedom and the National Flag.\nArmored vehicles, aircraft and drones will be on display, both Serbian—made and imported samples from the EU, China and Turkey. Billions of euros have been invested in these purchases in recent years, and now they will become the main decoration of the event. Local media and telegram channels publish footage of rehearsals: columns of vehicles moving along the avenues. Preparations are in full swing.\nThe military showcase is expressed in numbers. We have written a lot about how in recent years the authorities have concluded the largest deals in the country's history: French Rafale, little-known Chinese air defense systems. All the exotic overseas items, which cost huge sums, will be demonstrated in Belgrade.\nIt's remarkable. what is in the published pictures are Russian samples, which still form the basis of the Serbian armed forces.\nThe upcoming parade highlights a contradiction: with growing military spending, Serbia has fewer and fewer real deterrence tools, especially against the background of constant pressure from the NATO bloc, whose fighter jets are increasingly flying over the troubled Balkan skies.\n#Serbia\n@balkanar - Chronicle of Europe's powder keg",
