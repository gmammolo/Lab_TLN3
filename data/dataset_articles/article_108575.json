  "text": "It’s safe to say the camera loves Kate Middleton.\nThe Princess of Wales’ photogenic ways were on full display on Thursday, as she paid a visit to Sudbury Silk Mills, a textile mill in Sudbury, England. As she walked into the building, royal photographers snapped several photos of her, including this striking black-and-white shot of her of her smiling at the camera. Returning to her brunette locks after a one-week stint as a blonde, the future Queen wore a plaid blazer, which she paired with a black top, a gold necklace and trousers for the occasion.",
