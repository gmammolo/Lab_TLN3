  "text": "Damascus-SANA\nCustoms and Border Protection officers (CBP) at Joussieh border crossing in Homs countryside seized on Thursday a shipment of narcotic hashish in the possession of a traveler arriving from Lebanon.\nThe General Authority of Land and Sea Ports in Syria stated that the quantity was confiscated, a formal seizure was carried out, and the case was referred to the Anti-Narcotics Department for further investigation and the necessary legal action against the smuggler.\nThe Authority also confirmed that its customs and security personnel are making great efforts around the clock to combat smuggling operations, particularly the smuggling of narcotics targeting Syrian society.\nThe competent authorities are making every effort to ensure the protection of the borders and security preservation of the homeland and its citizens.\nLast January, the administration of Nassib border crossing with Jordan seized a large shipment of more than 7 million narcotic pills hidden inside a shipment intended for export abroad.\nAdnan/Fedaa",
