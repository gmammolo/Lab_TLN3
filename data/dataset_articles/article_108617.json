  "text": "Security forces killed 19 Indian-backed terrorists during a series of intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in Mohmand, Bannu, and North Waziristan districts on the night of September 9 and 10, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday.\nAccording to the military’s media wing, the operations were launched following credible intelligence reports. In Mohmand’s Goluno area, 14 terrorists were killed in a major encounter.\nAnother four militants were eliminated during an operation in the Datta Khel area of North Waziristan, while one terrorist was killed in a separate action in Bannu district.\nWeapons and explosives were also recovered from the slain militants, who, according to ISPR, were involved in multiple acts of terrorism across the region. Security forces are continuing clearance operations to track down and eliminate the remaining networks.\nReaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to root out terrorism, ISPR stated that operations would continue until the menace is completely eradicated. It added that militants working under Indian patronage would be decisively defeated.",
