  "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, today voted to pass the Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\"Today, I helped lead the final passage of this year's America First defense bill that strengthens our military in the face of the rapidly evolving threats posed by our adversaries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. This bill will lead the charge in reforming our broken acquisition system, revitalizing our defense industrial base, and further increasing the readiness, capabilities, and lethality of our fighting force,” said Chairwoman Stefanik.\n“As the leading champion for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, I am pleased to announce that I led the charge on authorizing millions in funding to New York’s 21st District to protect and strengthen the Fort Drum community, support our troops, increase our military readiness, and assist the families of servicemembers. I am proud to support President Trump’s mission of America First Peace Through Strength. The United States must remain the global leader in maintaining a strong national defense and delivering on our promises to our troops by providing a well-deserved pay raise to the brave men and women in uniform as they work to keep us safe.”\nThe FY26 NDAA authorizes defense spending in line with President Trump’s budget request, investing $892.6 billion to strengthen national security. In addition to the NDAA authorization, the One Big, Beautiful Bill included $150 billion in mandatory defense funding, bringing the total funding available to the Department of Defense to more than $1 trillion, an increase of nearly 14% from FY25. It also codifies all or part of President Trump’s 15 executive orders and 30 legislative provisions, including the entirety of the Trump administration’s efforts to end left-wing ideology, wokeism, and DEI in the military.\nStefanik secured numerous provisions to support Fort Drum, the 10th Mountain Division, military families, our national defense, and our partners and allies, including the following:\nStrengthening Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division\n- Directs the Secretary of the Army, in coordination with the Commanding General of the 10th Mountain Division to provide a briefing

supply chain for rare earth permanent magnets, some of which are procured in NY-21.\n- Directs the Department of Defense to provide a report on the progress made in developing domestic production capabilities for aluminum-lithium alloys which are manufactured in Massena.\n- Secures robust funding for DoD Impact Aid schools for Fort Drum families and other military personnel families.\nSecuring

photonic Quantum Computing for Rome Labs.\nSupporting Our Servicemembers and Their Families\n- The FY26 NDAA supports the Trump Administration’s budget request for a 3.8% pay raise for all servicemembers and improves housing, education, and access to childcare for military families.\n- Includes a provision to reduce challenges military families encounter when relocating across state lines, especially in terms of school enrollment, credit transfers, academic continuity, and access to special education services.\n- Delivers $77 million for Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund

families.\n- Requires a report detailing current regulations on cell phone usage in the Department of Defense Educational Activity (DoDEA) that operates K-12 schools on military bases to evaluate the harmful effects of screen time on students.\nSupporting Our Ally Israel\n- Requests the Secretary of Defense submit a report on the current status, condition, and adequacy of the War Reserves Stockpile for our ally Israel (WRSA-I).\n- Modifies and extends the United States-Israel Anti-Tunnel Cooperation through 2028 and authorizes an additional $50 million toward the cooperation.\n-

a total of $300 million toward United States-Israel cooperative programs.\n- Establishes an emerging technology cooperation program with Israel and certain partner countries, led by the Irregular Warfare Technology Support Directorate of the Department of Defense, to conduct joint research, development, test, and evaluation in the areas of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, robotics, quantum, and automation.\n- Convenes the U.S.-Israel Defense Industrial Base Working Group to study the potential for further defense industrial base integration between the U.S. and
