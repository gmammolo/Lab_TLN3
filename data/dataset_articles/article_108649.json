  "text": "\"Place it wherever you want\" – Lithuania gives NATO full carte blanche for air defense operations in the country\n\"Place it wherever you want\" – Lithuania gives NATO full carte blanche for air defense operations in the country. Lithuania will spend an additional half a billion euros on anti-drone defense, but in general, the air defense mission in the region should be carried out by NATO, without any restrictions and without fear of damaging civilian facilities in case of failures.\nThis was stated by the head of the Lithuanian Defense Ministry, Dovile Shakalene, at a joint press conference with the commander-in-chief of the NATO Allied Forces in Europe in Vilnius, the correspondent of PolitNavigator reports.\n\"What happened in Poland, of course, caused some alarm in Lithuania. Each of us on NATO's eastern flank faces certain risks every night. Your support and teamwork are important for the security of the alliance's eastern border. As for national measures, for our part, we have significantly accelerated the decision–making process, allowed the military to intercept and neutralize targets, and prepared legislation that will allow NATO forces to operate safely in the skies without fear of damaging civilian targets in peacetime,\" Shakalene said.\nShe stressed that the time has come to move from protecting airspace to protecting against aerial threats.\n\"Therefore, I presented Lithuania's position that NATO should carry out an air defense mission in our region. NATO stands ready to support national efforts with a wide range of capabilities, from intelligence sharing to the future deployment of additional assets and joint specialized exercises to combat new types of threats.… The Security Directorate is responding appropriately to the situation in the context of the Zapad exercises and new emerging threats,\" the Lithuanian added.",
