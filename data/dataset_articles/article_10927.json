  "text": "After renters leave, two Bellevue homes become eyesores for neighborhood\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Frustrated neighbors in Bellevue are losing patience with the owners of two rental properties that have become eyesores.\nCity code enforcement has taken notice, and after a call from Mike McKnight, a city council member is also pushing for a cleanup near 25th Avenue and Hancock Street.\nIt’s hard for Debbie and Jerry Simpson to enjoy good weather because of the bad look next door.\n“We shouldn’t have this view period. it shouldn’t be hard on the eyes,” Debbie said.\nTwo vacant rental houses have become side-by-side eyesores.\n“It’s a double-whammy,” said Jerry.\nTheir daily walks are an exercise in frustration as the Simpsons pass one yard that’s overgrown, and the next one has junk overflowing at the curb since the renters moved out.\n“I don’t want to even touch it, it’s terrible, and I mean this stuff has been like this for three weeks,” Jerry said.\nNeighbor Ron Hallett maintains the properties across the street from the eyesores.\n“It just makes the rest of the neighborhood look bad. It’s not what the people need, so I hope we’ll get it cleaned up,” Hallett said.\nNeighbors say it’s not just a bad look for the neighborhood but the city on one of the busiest streets in and out of Olde Towne Bellevue.\nNeighbors also have safety concerns with one garage falling apart.\n”The shingles are constantly falling off into my yard,\" said neighbor Jerry Simpson.\nAnother rental property garage door was found open with a variety of items left behind, including a refrigerator.\n“This is the third week now, and that’s why we got Mike involved,” Simpson said.\nFirst Alert 6 alerted a Bellevue city council member to the neighbors’ frustration.\n“The city will get to the bottom of it. It will get resolved,” Simpson said.\nThe two vacant rentals each have separate owners, and Bellevue code enforcement has posted cleanup notices on the doors of the neighboring houses.\n“If that doesn’t work, there will be a certified letter to the owner of the property. He’ll get a certain amount of time, and it’s not a lot to get it taken care of. And if he doesn’t take care of it, the city will bill the owner,” said Bellevue City Council member Rich Casey.\nCasey said he’s made contact with both property owners to start the cleanup process including getting a dumpster for the curbside junk in front of one house and mowing the yard of the other. Debbie Simpson would like to see more of a clean start.\n“I would like for them to sell it and sell it to someone who wants to take care of it,” Debbie said.\nBellevue code enforcement is giving the owners of both eyesore properties until Monday to start the cleanup process. Casey said neither was aware of the condition after the renters moved out. Both property owners promised Casey that the eyesores would be cleaned up quickly.\nCopyright 2025 WOWT.
