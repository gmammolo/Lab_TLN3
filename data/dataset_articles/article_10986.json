  "text": "This article first appeared in Forum, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on June 16, 2025 - June 22, 2025\nThe football calendar is full. Bloated. Bursting, even. Every time you turn on the TV, there is a match. Somebody is playing somebody somewhere. But hey, isn’t it the end of the season for the stars? Yes, most leagues have finished, but there are still cups: the Nations Cup, World Cup qualifiers, Super Cups, and now one that The Guardian called “the most heinous footballing entity yet devised”.\nPlayers are burnt out and have considered going on strike. They have even taken legal action despite the money on offer. Injuries are mounting, careers are shortening and interest is waning. Time, then, for the game’s governing body, Fifa, to take a stand “For the Good of the Game”.\nMaking a mockery of its motto, it is Fifa that devised this abomination. The guardians of the game have gone rogue. Never likely to believe that less might be more, they have concocted a huge, unwanted tournament guaranteed to inflame anger.\nPompously labelled the Club World Cup (CWC), it kicks off on June 16 in the US, barely allowing time for the final whistle to blow on many regular seasons. It will not only rob players of a much-needed recovery period and increase their risk of injury, but also drag them vast distances to play many unknown opponents before an uninterested audience.\nBut unlike Manchester United’s sacrificial lambs, who kicked up a fuss about four days in Asia, the CWC players will be rewarded with a sizeable share of the loot. There is so much of it swilling around that Fifa has found enough to buy them off. Ditto the clubs, but it is still the last thing a creaking sport needed.\nThe arbitrary make-up of the participants is another thing. Liverpool, Barcelona and AC Milan are among the absentees, but Mamelodi Sundowns, Al Ahly and Seattle Sounders will be there. So, too, will Real Madrid and Manchester City and, shamefully, Inter Miami. Qualification is a mishmash that descended to farce when the previously eliminated club of Lionel Messi was reinstated as winners of something called the “Supporters’ Shield”.\nBut even Messi is a fading drawcard as a slashing of ticket prices and freebies for the opening match in Miami have shown. Either that or the American public is tiring of having what they know as “soccer” rammed down their throats.\nThe CWC is the second of three large-scale tournaments in the US in successive years. Last year, it hosted the Copa America, for South American nations plus guests, and next year, along with Canada and Mexico, it will stage the World Cup.\nAlready, the 48-nation 2026 tourney is being dubbed the MAGA Cup, no longer living up to its “United 2026” levels of cooperation after US President Donald Trump’s recent threats towards his neighbours. And ever the dealmaker, Trump has played a key role in facilitating support for this year’s edition.\nThe driving forces behind the CWC are the “forever war” between Fifa and UEFA for control of the game’s finances, and the oversized ego of Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Forever jealous of the riches of\nUEFA’s Champions League and its forerunner, the European Cup, Fifa craves its own club competition.\nThis is going beyond its original remit, which former president Sepp Blatter admitted, after countless wrangles between the two rivals, was his biggest mistake. “Fifa must concern itself with national federations, not clubs,” he said.\nBlatter’s successor sees it differently and senses an opportunity. Since 2005, there has been a low-key global competition involving seven teams — the six continental champions plus one from the host country — every December, over 10 days. Less than a year after his election, Infantino suggested an expanded version “to make the Club World Cup more interesting and attract sponsors and television companies from around the world”.\nBut football did not share his optimism. Backers were conspicuous by their absence, and it looked as if it wouldn’t happen. Then Covid-19 came along. Undaunted, once the pandemic ended, Infantino upped the ante with a new format of 32 clubs, calling it “an unforgettable celebration of our game that will revolutionise club football”.\nHe did add a caveat: “It’s an event that will grow edition by edition”, but the aim is clear: to make it second only to the World Cup and surpass the Champions League as the premier club event in world football. The forever war has become nuclear.\nStill, seven months ago, the CWC had only a single sponsor — Hisense, who sponsors everything — and no broadcaster, but Infantino knew who to go to. It takes one to know one, and he knew he could rely on fellow narcissist Donald Trump to help him out of a tight spot. And the massaging of the presidential ego duly worked.\nThey had met in Davos, in the Oval Office and again in Saudi Arabia, where Trump introduced the Swiss-Italian, 55, to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Infantino’s troubles would soon be over.\nStreaming service DAZN emerged out of nowhere to pay US$1 billion (RM4.22 billion) for the broadcasting rights. Well, not quite nowhere. It is the same DAZN in which Saudi Arabia’s Surj Sports Investment Group had just invested the same amount of money. Surj is part of the US$800 billion Saudi Public Investment Fund which suddenly found it had a bit to spare.\nSo, Saudi Arabia is funding the Club World Cup just months after securing the already controversial 2034 World Cup. Fifa will now pay US$1 billion to its participating clubs. The CWC is saved by Trump and Bin Salman. Neither is an aficionado of football, but they love power. And Infantino is already a big winner — whatever happens, his name is laser-inscribed on the trophy — twice.\nGoing global might not seem an outrageous move in countries outside the two dominant continents. But Europe is where the world’s best players gravitate, even from South America, to make European clubs and tournaments the undisputed best on the planet. Indeed, the quality of Champions League football is widely considered to be superior to the World Cup (between nations), even if it does not have the prestige. So, pitting the champions of smaller fry against the kings of Europe means an inevitable lowering of the overall standard.\nIt will drop anyway by asking elite players to play in it straight after they have played in the other tournament, even if it happens only once in four years. And not only will it wreck the off-season of those who play in both, it will also distort the season that follows. Some players will have had a rest and some will not.\nBarcelona’s Frankie de Jong summed it up by saying: “When I was young, you looked forward to a European or international match for days. Now you only have to turn on the TV and there is a match somewhere. They are commercially milking football.”\nInterest in the CWC from Europe is so low that the current broadcaster, DAZN, has been unable to sell any viewing rights in the UK. The tourney also clashes with the women’s European Championships, telling us what Infantino really thinks of women’s football.\nThe overkill has been compared to when entertainment giant Disney flooded the market with too many films. CEO Bob Iger admitted the content overload “diluted focus and attention” for the brand. Right now, football is finding it hard to resist calling the Club World Cup a Mickey Mouse event.",
