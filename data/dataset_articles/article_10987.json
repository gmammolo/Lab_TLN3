  "text": "A 30-year-old Eastvale woman who illegally obtained nearly $2 million in federal benefits distributed after filing fraudulent applications for loans and other aid during the coronavirus pandemic was sentenced Wednesday to seven years in prison.\nJasmine Unique Mallad McCarter pleaded guilty in February to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\nDuring a hearing at U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles Wednesday, Judge Maame Frimpong imposed the stipulated sentence and ordered McCarter to pay $1.76 million in restitution — equal to the amount she illegally procured.\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, in the early 2020s, the defendant impersonated various unidentified parties whose personal identifying information she acquired, and then proceeded to use those names, Social Security numbers and other details to apply for pandemic-relief small business loans, unemployment benefits and Los Angeles County economic opportunity grants.\n“McCarter charged fees to instruct others how to apply for government benefits for which they were not eligible without getting caught,” according to an agency statement.\n“Also for a fee, McCarter served as a broker for counterfeit documents. In some instances, McCarter and her co-conspirators used the counterfeit documents to trick the government into paying unjustified benefits.”\nThe defendant went so far as to advertise her illicit benefits filching operation via Instagram, identifying herself using the handles JassyMc and EliteRealEstateBusiness.\n“McCarter referred to herself as the `Jass-of-All-Trades’ in social media posts because she could file fraudulent unemployment insurance applications, file grant applications and broker counterfeit documents and identification in return for a fee,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.\n“According to her posts, she charged a fee for introducing customers to a connection at the California Department of Motor Vehicles, who could help bypass requirements for smog checks, insurance and registration.”\nThe case was investigated by multiple agencies, including the FBI and U.S. Departments of Labor and Homeland Security.\nThere was no information regarding any prior criminal history, and prosecutors did not specify whether any of the defendant’s co-conspirators were charged in connection with the investigation.",
