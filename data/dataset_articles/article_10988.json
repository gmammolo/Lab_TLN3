  "text": "By Kimberley Kao\nAsian stock markets fell Thursday, tracking U.S. futures as investors weighed concerns about inflation in the U.S. and potential escalation in Middle East tensions.\nJapan's Nikkei Stock Average declined 0.8% and South Korea's Kospi was 0.5% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.95%, while China's Shanghai Composite Index was 0.3% lower.\nFutures tied to U.S. indexes were in the red. Dow futures were down 0.2%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures fell 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday projected confidence when he insisted the central bank was in a good position to handle whatever the economy does next, but acknowledged that the Fed has little idea what's actually coming.\n\"We haven't been through a situation like this, and I think we have to be humble about our ability to forecast it,\" Powell said.\nWhile the Fed's decision to retain the status quo was widely expected, the key context is that more Fed members now see fewer rate cuts this year, reflecting their expectations for elevated and persistent uncertainty, Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Securities said in a note.\nEconomic projections show officials expect U.S. inflation and unemployment to rise this year by more than they projected in March.\nStill, markets seem less fussed about the Fed decision and more concerned about geopolitics, Varathan said.\n\"For now, the Iran-Israel conflict is likely to drown out Fed nuances as headline-driven instincts for risk re-pricing will dominate,\" he said.\nFront-month WTI crude oil futures were 0.1% lower at $75.09 a barrel on Thursday morning in Asia. Brent crude futures were down 0.4% to $76.40 a barrel.\nHowever, oil prices remain on an upward trajectory.\nCrude prices rose nearly 20% in June, with more than half of the gains occurring just this week, said Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at Phillip Nova, in a note.\n\"Investors, however, are still preparing for volatility,\" Sachdeva said.\nBitcoin, viewed as a proxy for risk, was 0.2% higher.\nMeanwhile, spot gold was last up 0.2% at $3,377.11 a troy ounce.\nGoldman Sachs research analysts said in a note that the investment bank's \"global indices of oil shipping rates reflect an increase over the past week as increased risks have lifted rates for Middle Eastern routes.\"\nThe probability of U.S. military action against Iran appears to be higher than a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, meaning that oil markets will likely see elevated prices over the next few months, the Goldman analysts said.\nWrite to Kimberley Kao at kimberley.kao@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n06-18-25 2343ET\nShare © Dow Jones - 2025",
