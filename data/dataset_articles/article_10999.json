  "text": "DALLAS — Spring is more than just a weather season -- it is the start of \"the season\" in real estate. And this year, the season was looking really good at first, says Broker Joe Atkins of Joe Atkins Realty.\n“We had a lot of momentum that last week in March, which is usually kind of the start of the spring market as school ends,” Atkins said.\nBut then came April. And the Trump tariffs.\nAtkins said that early momentum was quickly lost, and so were some offers, including on a 4-bedroom Lake Highlands home on the market for $750,000. The listing had quickly gotten two offers, but then the tariffs were announced, and “one of the offers was pulled immediately.\"\nAtkins wasn’t the only realtor who went through this. He said one of the largest brokerages in North Texas told him lots of deals have come undone.\n“In April, they had about half of their contracts terminate…largely due to fear of the tariffs,\" Atkins said.\nBut why? It’s not like homes were being imported into the country and were therefore subject to the new Trump taxes.\nAtkins said it was because tariffs made buyers worry about the cost of living increasing, a possible recession, the safety of their jobs, and their investments that were getting battered in the stock market.\nThat might all help to explain this: Redfin says in April, there were almost half a million (490,041) more home sellers than buyers. That causes the inventory of homes for sale to build up.\nAtkins noticed that phenomenon in just one price range in his own neighborhood.\n“In Lakewood, our inventory for houses priced $2-2.5 million, three years ago, there were five homes for sale in that price point. There are 33 right now. There are a lot of other neighborhoods that have the same issue,” Atkins explained.\nAccording to the Texas Real Estate Research Center, major markets across Texas recently had a greater supply of homes sitting -- waiting to be sold -- than we have seen going all the way back to 2012, even 2011.\nDFW had 4.32 months of inventory (the most since September 2012), the Houston area had 4.59 months’ worth (the most since August 2012), the San Antonio metro had 5.34 months (the most since November 2012, and the Austin area had 5.25 months of homes for sale (the most since August 2011).\n'Gridlock market'\nAtkins calls this a \"gridlock market.\" To try to get it moving, he said many sellers have been cutting their asking prices. Atkins points out that, “Nationally, we've seen more price reductions this year than we've seen in all of the last five years”.\nHere is what he is referring to: Data shows that in the first quarter of 2025, prices were reduced on U.S. homes for sale 265,970 times. That's more price reductions in the first quarter than there were in 2024 (201,536 price reductions), 2023 (174,024 price reductions), 2022 (70,039 price reductions), 2021 (86,812 price reductions), 2020 (209,399 price reductions).\nAtkins said buyers should make their best offer, because a seller might be open to that offer or something close to it. Atkins says he has seen specific instances that back that up.\n“Absolutely, I've been blown up on both sides of the transaction -- buy and sell -- by seeing what somebody is willing to take,\" Atkins said.\nSome sellers are also offering enticements now that go well beyond price cuts and beyond paying the commission of the buyer’s agent, including “giving away trips.\"\n\"You know you're trying to do anything you can that might spur activity,\" Atkins said. \"It always doesn't just come down to price. Sometimes it just comes down to getting enough people to see your house.”\nIf you are selling, Atkins advises that you pay close attention to trying to price your property competitively from the beginning. He also says to beware that in some areas where prices have fallen off faster. If you’re relying on recent comparable sales around you to help you determine how much you’re asking, those previous prices of like homes that sold even just a few months ago may be higher than what the market will bear now.\nBut homes are still going for quite a bit more than they have historically, so Atkins advises you to make sure yours is ready to be lived in. The more updated it is, the more likely it is to sell because many cash-strapped buyers don’t have the extra money for a fixer-upper project.\nFinally, more competition, price reductions, and more days on the market can be disheartening to sellers, but Atkins says when mortgage rates start to come down significantly, get ready for the buying frenzy.\n“The second rates do come down, you're going to see a run on the market,\" Atkins said. \"We know when rates come in, there are a lot of people on the sidelines that are going to jump in.\"\nThat’s good news for sellers. The not-so-good news: we don’t know when those mortgage rates will finally fall significantly again.",
