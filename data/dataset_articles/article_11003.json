  "text": "Listen to this article in summarized format\nTired of too many ads? Remove Ads\nChina's trade surplus -- the amount by which its exports exceed its imports -- hit a staggering $1.19 trillion in 2025, according to official numbers released on Wednesday. The figure shows just how much China is an exporting powerhouse. It is also a sign of China's economic weakness -- and of how its practices represents a greater danger to free trade than even President Trump's tariffs.\nThe tariffs undoubtedly took a hammer to free trade. With the United States retreating from its leadership role, China has tried to assume the mantle of being the promoter of globalization and the defender of the multilateral rules-based system that underpins\nglobal trade(which, incidentally, the United States played a major role in setting up).\nChina's economic model has certainly delivered growth, but in an unbalanced way. Investment in buildings, machinery and equipment became its main driver in recent years. That investment is of course good in that it raises productive potential. But with real estate investment declining because of falling housing prices, a lot of this investment has been undertaken by state owned enterprises and is neither efficient nor profitable.\nStill, all of this investment has meant the production of lots of goods. That sounds like a blessing but has instead spawned a problem. Domestic consumption has not kept pace with rising output because Chinese households are reticent to spend freely. Facing uncertain employment prospects and with the value of their real estate wealth plunging, they have been stashing away a lot of their earnings in savings. Moreover, household confidence seems to have taken a hit from concerns about the government's economic management skills, further crimping demand.\nTired of too many ads? Remove Ads\nWhen an economy produces more than it consumes, something has to give. One possibility is that prices fall, which usually tends to encourage consumers to buy more. But when households anticipate continually falling prices, they might postpone consumption rather than increase it. China has indeed been facing such deflationary pressures.\nThe only option left is to send surplus goods abroad. This is exactly what China has been doing, with its exports growing by leaps and bounds. The United States is the exception. Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods have resulted in exports to the United States falling sharply. This has meant that China has been increasing exports to its other trading partners, counting ever more on them to absorb its surplus output and keep its own growth on track.\nSurely recipient countries should be grateful for inexpensive Chinese goods landing on their shores. The reality is that, unlike the U.S. economy, which has been powering along with relatively robust gross domestic product and employment growth, most other rich economies such as Europe, Japan and the United Kingdom are in dire straits. Chinese exports are swamping their manufacturers who are unable to compete. Even low- and middle-income countries have a difficult time countering Chinese exporters, causing some of their firms to be strangled at birth.\nThis situation is unsustainable and the countries on the receiving end are fighting back. President Emmanuel Macron of France recently raised the trade issue with his hosts in Beijing. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that Europe risked becoming a dumping ground for Chinese goods. Mexico has raised tariffs on imports from China and other countries are likely to follow suit.\nBeijing has countered with pleas for keeping trade free and open. But China cannot claim to be a fervent supporter of the global trading system when it is using those rules to its advantage and to the detriment of everyone else. For the second-largest economy in the world to be relying on other countries to prop up its growth will only accelerate the breakdown of the rules-based system. The combination of Trump's tariffs and the onslaught of Chinese exports will wreck what remains.\nThis is not to say that world trade will collapse. The benefits from trade and cross-border supply chains are so large that they will continue to grow. But trade is fragmenting in ways that reduce the benefits, especially if countries begin emphasizing trade with their geopolitical allies and try to shut out rivals. The fragmentation will leave poorer economies, which are only now integrating into global trade, worse off.\nWhat could China do? It could get serious about fixing its growth imbalance and make changes, such as strengthening its social safety net, that would encourage its citizens to spend. The government has acknowledged this is a priority but shows no urgency to act given that growth has stayed around its 5 percent target. Now that is at risk of weakening, the government might yet again resort to its old playbook of credit-financed investment to stimulate the economy, which would worsen the problem.\nChina's central bank could allow the Chinese currency to appreciate, something it has been resisting recently. A stronger currency would make Chinese exports more expensive in other countries, imports less costly for Chinese consumers, and thus would help tamp down the trade surplus. Its currency would gain prominence in global finance, something Beijing has long desired, if its value was seen as determined by the market instead of the central bank.\nDoing what's best for the long run would allow China to help the world economy. If not, China would not only damage global growth, but would also cede any claim to a leadership role in the evolving new world order.",
