  "text": "Thursday, 15 January 2026 , 11:36 AM\nGlobal oil prices witnessed a significant decline on Thursday, January 15, 2026, with both major benchmarks dropping by more than 2% in a single session.\nThis reversal ended a multi-day rally that had been driven by fears of a military conflict in the Middle East.\nHere are the primary factors contributing to the price drop:\nEasing Tensions with Iran\nThe most immediate driver was a shift in rhetoric from US President Donald Trump. Earlier in the week, prices surged as the US administration threatened military action and 25% tariffs on countries doing business with Tehran following the violent crackdown on protesters in Iran.\nHowever, on Wednesday afternoon, President Trump stated he had received assurances that the killing of protesters had stopped and suggested he might hold off on military strikes for now. This eased \"risk premiums\" that traders had baked into the price, leading to a swift sell-off.\nSurge in US Oil Inventories\nData released by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a much larger-than-expected build-up of US crude oil and gasoline stocks.\nResumption of Venezuelan Exports\nFollowing the recent regime change in Caracas and the ouster of Nicolás Maduro, the new transitional government has begun releasing stranded oil.\nBroader 2026 Supply Surplus Forecasts\nLong-term forecasts continue to weigh on the market. Both the EIA and Goldman Sachs have projected that global oil production will exceed demand throughout 2026.\nExperts predict that Brent crude could average as low as $56 per barrel this year due to rising production in the US and the return of sanctioned oil to the global market.\nPrice Summary (as of Jan 15, 2026)\n| Benchmark | Price (per barrel) | Change |\n| Brent Crude | $64.85 | ▼ 2.5% (-$1.67) |\n| WTI Crude | $60.48 | ▼ 2.5% (-$1.54) |",
