  "text": "Germany- /\nConstruction- /\n- XTRA:NCH2\nThere's Reason For Concern Over thyssenkrupp nucera AG & Co. KGaA's (ETR:NCH2) Price\nIt's not a stretch to say that thyssenkrupp nucera AG & Co. KGaA's (ETR:NCH2) price-to-sales (or \"P/S\") ratio of 1.4x seems quite \"middle-of-the-road\" for Construction companies in Germany, seeing as it matches the P/S ratio of the wider industry. While this might not raise any eyebrows, if the P/S ratio is not justified investors could be missing out on a potential opportunity or ignoring looming disappointment.\n View our latest analysis for thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA\nHow thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA Has Been Performing\nthyssenkrupp nucera KGaA hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining revenue compares poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth in their revenues on average. It might be that many expect the dour revenue performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/S from falling. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.\nIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out ourfree report on thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA.\nDo Revenue Forecasts Match The P/S Ratio?\nThe only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/S like thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA's is when the company's growth is tracking the industry closely.\nTaking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 2.0%. Even so, admirably revenue has lifted 121% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing revenue over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.\nTurning to the outlook, the next three years should bring diminished returns, with revenue decreasing 6.2% per annum as estimated by the nine analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the broader industry is forecast to expand by 5.3% each year, which paints a poor picture.\nIn light of this, it's somewhat alarming that thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA's P/S sits in line with the majority of other companies. Apparently many investors in the company reject the analyst cohort's pessimism and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/S falls to levels more in line with the negative growth outlook.\nThe Final Word\nTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\nWhile thyssenkrupp nucera KGaA's P/S isn't anything out of the ordinary for companies in the industry, we didn't expect it given forecasts of revenue decline. When we see a gloomy outlook like this, our immediate thoughts are that the share price is at risk of declining, negatively impacting P/S. If the declining revenues were to materialize in the form of a declining share price, shareholders will be feeling the pinch.\nAnd what about other risks?
