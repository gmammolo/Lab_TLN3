  "text": "A settlement agreement between comedian Park Na-rae and her former managers was revealed.On the 15th, The Munhwa Ilbo Company obtained and reported a draft of the settlement agreement exchanged between Park Na-rae and her former managers, who have been trading allegations and confronting each other day after day.According to the report, the draft settlement showed clear differences in positions between Park Na-rae's side and the former managers. The exchanged draft contained provisions to pay money, but no specific settlement amount was stated. This was because there were stark differences of opinion over the reasons for payment and who was responsible.Park Na-rae's side wrote that \"the departing employees confirm and agree that the company Anpark (Park Na-rae's single-artist agency) and the artist agreed to make additional payments out of goodwill, considering their relationship with the departing employees, not because of any legal obligation,\" and the former managers wrote that \"Party A recognizes without objection any unpaid wages, unpaid performance bonuses, unsettled amounts and amounts calculated according to applicable laws and contracts between the parties for Party B (Person A) and Party C (Person B).\"In addition, Park Na-rae's side added clauses to the agreement stating \"the departing employees acknowledge and admit that they falsely reported to the artist that the registration for popular culture and arts planning business had been completed around Sept. 2025, despite not having processed the registration,\" and \"the departing employees acknowledge and agree that the failure to enroll in the four major social insurances was handled at the departing employees' request, and that Anpark processed their enrollment as soon as the departing employees requested enrollment due to changed circumstances.\"In particular, in the liquidated damages and penalty clause, Park Na-rae's side demanded that \"if any of the departing employees violates an obligation under this agreement, they must pay 1 billion won each as liquidated damages to Anpark and the artist.\" The draft sent by the former managers included a provision stating that \"if a party breaches this clause, the breach alone will be regarded as an admission of culpability, and the breaching party will pay the other party 30 million won per breach as liquidated damages.\"Meanwhile, Park Na-rae's former managers announced last month on the 3rd that they would file a suit seeking about 100 million won in damages, alleging workplace harassment, special injury, proxy prescriptions and unpaid event fees. In response, Park Na-rae has filed complaints against the former managers for attempted extortion and embezzlement in the course of business, deepening the conflict.[OSEN]",
