  "text": "Residents, businesses baulk at near 40pc rate hike proposal in Cessnock\nIn short:\nCessnock City Council will apply to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) to seek a near 40 per cent rate rise, amid financial troubles.\nBusinesses and residents say the increase will price people out of one of the fastest-growing regions in New South Wales.\nWhat's next?\nIPART is expected to hand down a decision by May.\nResidents and small business owners in the regional New South Wales town of Cessnock fear an almost 40 per cent rate hike approved by their local council will price people out of the area.\nAt a meeting on Wednesday night, councillors voted in favour (nine for, four against) of a permanent one-year special rate variation of 39.9 per cent, to improve the council's dire financial situation.\nThe council will now apply to the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) for approval, which, if accepted, would see some ratepayers face an increase of thousands of dollars in one year.\n| Category | Current rate | Average rate with variation applied | Cumulative increase |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Farmland | $3,409 | $4,796 | +$1,360 |\n| Residential | $1,494 | $2,090 | +$596 |\n| Business | $5,188 | $7,258 | +$2,070 |\n| Source: Cessnock City Council |\nCessnock resident Fay Wiltshire said many people would not be able to pay the higher cost.\n\"People are concerned about the cost of living and how are they going to make ends meet,\" she said.\n\"Some people might get by, but there's a lot that won't.\"\nMs Wiltshire said there was a lot of housing development being built in the region, but she feared many people, particularly young families, would not be able to afford to live in the area.\n\"If they put up the rate high like this, it's only going to be what I call the elite people that are going to be able to live here,\" she said.\n\"Because normal every day Joe Blows won't be able to.\"\nBusiness Hunter CEO Bob Hawes said the council had the discretion on how the increase was shared among ratepayers.\n\"Some ratepayers could get a 10 per cent increase, others substantially more,\" he said.\nCouncil 'facing administration'\nA rate increase was recommended following an independent review of the council's financial history and economic position.\nIt noted the council had a budget deficit of more than $8 million and at a time when it was one of the fastest growing local government areas in New South Wales.\nMayor Daniel Watton told ABC Newcastle Breakfast's Paul Culliver that raising rates was not an easy decision.\n\"I was faced with facts, not just with what was happening with the budget, but the cost shifting from the state government,\" he said.\n\"If we didn't do something with this, we probably wouldn't have a council to defend. It was heading towards administration.\n\"As burdensome as what it is, [the rate increase] will give council an extra $20 million, but that could have easily be taken care of with financial assistance grants [from the government].\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Minister for Local Government Ron Hoenig said councils received \"significant funding from the state and federal governments to help deliver the services communities need\".\n\"The NSW Government is progressing reforms to support the financial sustainability of local government in NSW,\" the statement read.\nIan Olsen served as an independent councillor for Cessnock for 24 years, retiring in 2024.\nHe said he raised the issue of council's financial position several times during his tenure.\n\"In my last 12 years as a councillor, I spoke about how we were going backwards and we needed to reel it in or do something,\" he said.\n'Unfathomable' rise for small businesses\nMichael Jenness runs a fresh food providore in Cessnock with 15 staff, and said a 40 per cent rate hike would be an added pressure for his small business.\n\"With the cost of living … we've noticed people are just buying what they need,\" he said.\n\"You're already working hard as a business owner, but to try and absorb another 40 per cent increase on top of all the added pressures of small business already is just unfathomable.\"\nCommunity sentiment\nFewer than 5 per cent of residents responded to a mailed survey seeking feedback on the proposed special rate variation.\nAn independent report prepared for council noted there was no way of knowing the views of the remaining 95 per cent of residents, although it was \"reasonable to subscribe\" that non-participation may indicate strong opinions were not held.\nThat assessment was formed despite an online community petition opposing the rate hike, which attracted more than 5,000 signatures.\nIPART is set to hand down a decision on the proposal in May.\nABC Newcastle — local news in your inbox\nABC Privacy Collection Statement.",
