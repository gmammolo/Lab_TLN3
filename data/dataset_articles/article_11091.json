  "text": "United Kingdom- /\nOil and Gas- /\n- LSE:TLW\nGreat week for Tullow Oil plc (LON:TLW) institutional investors after losing 68% over the previous year\nKey Insights\n- Significantly high institutional ownership implies Tullow Oil's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\n- The top 9 shareholders own 51% of the company\n- Using data from\nanalyst forecastsalongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Tullow Oil plc (LON:TLW), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 65% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\nAfter a year of 68% losses, last week’s 16% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a possible sign that returns might start trending higher.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Tullow Oil.\n View our latest analysis for Tullow Oil\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Tullow Oil?\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nWe can see that Tullow Oil does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Tullow Oil's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Tullow Oil. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is azValor Asset Management SGIIC, S.A.U. with 15% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.1% and 5.9% of the stock.\nWe did some more digging and found that 9 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Tullow Oil\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in Tullow Oil plc. In their own names, insiders own UK£10m worth of stock in the UK£111m company. Some would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board, though we generally prefer to see bigger insider holdings. But it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Tullow Oil. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nPrivate Company Ownership\nOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 14%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.\nNext Steps:\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.
