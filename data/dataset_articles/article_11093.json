  "text": "사진 확대 Chung Ki-seok, chairman of the National Health Insurance Corporation, speaks about the loss of the second trial of a large-scale damage suit filed against major tobacco companies at the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho-gu, Seoul on the 15th. [Yonhap News] It also lost the second trial of a 50 billion won damages lawsuit filed by the National Health Insurance Service against tobacco companies.\nAccording to the legal community on the 15th, the Seoul High Court Civil Division 6-1 (Chief Judges Park Hae-bin, Kwon Soon-min, and Lee Kyung-hoon) ruled against the plaintiff in an appeals trial for damages filed by the National Health Insurance Corporation against KT&G, Philip Morris Korea, and British American Tobacco Korea.\n\"Since the plaintiff fulfilled his obligations under the Insurance Act and executed his funds, it is difficult to say that any infringement of legal interests has occurred to the plaintiff,\" the court said. \"It is difficult to admit that there is an offense in the first trial ruling that did not recognize the plaintiff's direct claim.\"\nHe ruled, \"All appeals of the plaintiff are dismissed, and the cost of the appeal is borne by the plaintiff.\"\nEarlier in April 2014, the NHIC filed a lawsuit for damages worth 53.3 billion won, claiming that tobacco manufacturers manufactured and sold products while concealing the harmful effects of smoking, resulting in increased insurance benefit spending.\nHowever, the first trial court rejected all claims by the National Health Insurance Corporation in November 2020, saying, \"Diseases such as lung cancer can be caused by various factors other than smoking.\" It also judged that even if the National Health Insurance Service spent insurance benefits, it could only exercise its right to indemnify and could not claim direct damages against tobacco companies.",
