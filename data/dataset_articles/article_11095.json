  "text": "Despite the slump in the construction economy, the cost of public housing construction is rising sharply due to inflation in raw material prices and labor costs. Public housing touted a “good price” in the 300 million–400 million won range at the time of advance subscriptions, but with construction costs increasing, total project costs have risen by more than 60% in some cases, and sales prices are expected to climb in tandem.On the 15th, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and Korea Land & Housing Corporation (LH), the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport approved a change to the public housing construction plan to increase the project cost for the Incheon Gyeyang A9 block from 173.4 billion won to 281.3 billion won. That is an increase of 107.9 billion won (62.2%) from the original plan.The Incheon Gyeyang A9 block is a third new town project supplying nine apartment buildings, two underground to 15 above-ground floors, with 475 households on a total floor area of 66,867.25 square meters across Gyeyang-gu, Incheon. It will be supplied as a Newlywed Hope Town. The project period runs through Dec. 2028.Not only at this site, but the costs of most public housing projects also increased last year. At the Jinjeop 2 District A3 block in Namyangju, Gyeonggi, slated for a Newlywed Hope Town, the project cost rose from 104.4 billion won to 175 billion won, up 70.6 billion won (67.7%). The Hwaseong Dongtan 2 A78 block likewise saw its project cost increase from 456.2 billion won to 581.9 billion won, up 125.7 billion won (27.5%).Project costs have risen like this because construction expenses, including labor and material costs, jumped in the five years since the plan was released. Expenses related to strengthened safety regulations also increased. In the second half of last year, LH’s housing construction cost index for for-sale housing was tallied at 122.05. That was up 0.53% from the previous half and 22.05% from the second half of 2020. The index for rental housing construction costs was 122.83, up 0.59% from the previous half and 22.83% from the second half of 2020.The LH housing construction cost index measures period-by-period changes in construction costs invested in multifamily housing construction. The second half of 2020 serves as the base (100).The problem is that higher project costs can be passed on to sales prices. At the Uijeongbu Ujeong A-1 block last year, project costs rose 43.6% from 188.8 billion won to 271.2 billion won due to higher construction costs and project delays, pushing up sales prices. At the time of advance subscriptions, the estimated sales price for an exclusive 59 square meters was 333.61 million won, but the main subscription price rose to 390.75 million won, up about 57 million won.At the Goyang Changneung A4, S5, and S6 blocks as well, main subscription prices were up as much as 100 million won from the estimated prices at the time of advance subscriptions. As prices rose from the advance subscription stage, many advance subscription winners gave up their main subscriptions.At the Incheon Gyeyang A9 block, too, the sales price is expected to rise alongside project costs. When advance subscriptions were held in 2021, the estimated sales price for an exclusive 55 square meters was set at 339.13 million won. However, with project costs rising sharply, a price increase appears unavoidable for the main subscription scheduled for March this year.However, with the greater Seoul real estate market on an upswing and expectations that the Incheon Gyeyang A9 block’s sales price will still be lower than market rates, the rate of advance subscription withdrawals is not expected to be as high as last year.LH says it aims to ensure the burden of rising project costs is not passed on to the public. An LH official said, “Incheon Gyeyang A9 block applied for project approval in 2021, and since then not only construction costs but also compensation unit prices have risen significantly, pushing up project costs,” adding, “However, this block is subject to the price ceiling system, and sales prices are set considering surrounding market prices and appraised values, so it is hard to see the entire increase in project costs being passed on to sales prices.”",
