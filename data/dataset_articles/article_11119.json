  "text": "Private companies among Icade's (EPA:ICAD) largest stockholders and were hit after last week's 5.8% price drop\nKey Insights\n- Icade's significant private companies ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public\n- The top 2 shareholders own 58% of the company\n-\nInstitutional ownership in Icade is 13%\nA look at the shareholders of Icade (EPA:ICAD) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 58% to be precise, is private companies. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nAnd last week, private companies endured the biggest losses as the stock fell by 5.8%.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Icade, beginning with the chart below.\n Check out our latest analysis for Icade\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Icade?\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nIcade already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Icade's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Icade. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations with 39% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 19% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 2.9% by the third-largest shareholder.\nA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 58% stake.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\nInsider Ownership Of Icade\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Icade. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own €52k worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.\nGeneral Public Ownership\nWith a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Icade. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nPrivate Company Ownership\nIt seems that Private Companies own 58%, of the Icade stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\nNext Steps:\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Icade better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Icade , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\nBut ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.
