  "text": "MJ Gleeson (LON:GLE) investors are sitting on a loss of 37% if they invested five years ago Simply Wall St Thu, 15 January 2026 at 7:16 am GMT+2 3 min read\nIn this article: GLE.L\nWhile not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the MJ Gleeson plc ( LON:GLE ) share price has gained 14% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. After all, the share price is down 45% in that time, significantly under-performing the market.\nIt's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, MJ Gleeson actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 26% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\nBecause of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\nIn contrast to the share price, revenue has actually increased by 10% a year in the five year period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nLSE:GLE Earnings and Revenue Growth January 15th 2026 We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts\nWhat About Dividends? It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of MJ Gleeson, it has a TSR of -37% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\nStory Continues A Different Perspective Investors in MJ Gleeson had a tough year, with a total loss of 8.8% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 28%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 7% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with MJ Gleeson .\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.
