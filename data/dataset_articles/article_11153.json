Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of RVRC Holding, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for RVRC Holding OM:RVRC Ownership Breakdown January 15th 2026 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About RVRC Holding? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in RVRC Holding. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at RVRC Holding's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. OM:RVRC Earnings and Revenue Growth January 15th 2026 We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in RVRC Holding. The company's largest shareholder is Nyrensten Global Holding AB, with ownership of 12%. With 9.2% and 5.2% of the shares outstanding respectively, Handelsbanken Asset Management and Swedbank Robur Fonder AB are the second and third largest shareholders. In addition, we found that Paul Fischbein, the CEO has 0.5% of the shares allocated to their name. A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 18 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. Insider Ownership Of RVRC Holding The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our information suggests that RVRC Holding AB (publ) insiders own under 1% of the company. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. It appears that the board holds about kr47m worth of stock. This compares to a market capitalization of kr6.3b. We generally like to see a board more invested. However it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership With a 49% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over RVRC Holding. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. Private Company Ownership We can see that Private Companies own 12%, of the shares on issue. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company. Next Steps: It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company.
