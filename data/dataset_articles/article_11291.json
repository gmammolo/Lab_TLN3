  "text": "EMEA Morning Briefing: Oil Falls After Trump Cools Iran Tensions\nMARKET WRAPS\nWatch For:\nEU foreign trade, industrial production; Germany GDP; U.K. GDP, trade, industrial production; trading updates from OMV, Richemont, Taylor Wimpey, Ashmore Group, Pepco Group\nOpening Call:\nEuropean stock futures traded higher early Thursday. Asian stock benchmarks largely advanced; the dollar was little changed; Treasury yields rose; while oil futures slid and gold fell.\nEquities:\nStock futures point to a higher open in Europe on Thursday. Investors' growing sense of optimism about the U.S. economy, and their more-cautious view of the artificial-intelligence build-out, have spurred a shift away from some of the recent tech highfliers and into stocks poised to benefit from a reacceleration in growth.\nMeanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday said Iran had stopped killing antiregime protesters and wouldn't execute those it accused of trying to topple the government, appearing to narrow the possibility that the U.S. was about to launch military strikes against the country.\nForex:\nThe Norwegian krone is likely to rise against the Swiss franc, supported by the interest-rate differential and higher oil prices, Societe Generale strategists said. Short positions betting on franc falls against the krone is Europe's top G-10 carry trade where investors borrow in a low yielding currency to invest in higher yielding currencies.\nSticky inflation should keep the Norges Bank cautious on cutting interest rates, SocGen said. Renewed geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran could lead to further recovery in oil prices. SocGen recommends a short position in franc-krone with a target of 11.90 krone and stop-loss of 12.85.\nBonds:\nThe default protection costs for European bank bonds are low amid strong appetite from investors. The robust demand likely shows that investors have a positive view on the banking sector in 2026, ABN Amro strategists said.\nEnergy:\nOil slid in Asia after Trump appeared to tilt away from military action in Iran. Trump said the \"killing in Iran is stopping,\" NAB's Ken Crompton said. Trump's remarks seemed to \"walk back threats against Iran, \" supporting a slump in oil, he added.\nMetals:\nGold declined early Thursday amid possible profit-taking after front-month Comex gold futures settled at a record high overnight. However, further price losses may be limited by geopolitical risks.\nFocus could stay on developments around Iran and other areas in the region as well as potential actions from the U.S., DHF Capital's Bas Kooijman said. Also, \"tensions in Eastern Europe remain unresolved, keeping geopolitical risk premia elevated,\" he said.\n-\nHigh prices of copper are likely to be sustained throughout 1Q as long as there's uncertainty surrounding tariffs on U.S. refined copper, Goldman Sachs said. Further near-term price gains are also likely, with speculator long positions as a share of total open interest on CME not as extreme as in previous speculative peaks.\nThat said, GS thinks the bulk of the rally has already occurred and prices are increasingly vulnerable to a correction. GS forecasts the LME copper price to decline to $11,000 by December.\n-\nChina's iron ore imports climbed to 120 million metric tons in December, maintaining strong momentum following earlier holiday restocking, ANZ said.\nThe country's annual iron-ore import volume reached 1.26 billion tons, up 1.8%, which indicates continuing support from steel-mill replenishment. This is despite domestic output remaining subdued, ANZ added.\nTODAY'S TOP HEADLINES\nTrump Puts 25% Tariffs on Chips. It Only Matters to Nvidia and AMD-for Now.\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders to impose tariffs on some semiconductors and prepare for tariffs on critical minerals, if needed.\nThe semiconductor order codifies what Trump said in December when he implied that Nvidia would pay the U.S. 25% of H200 chip sales to China.\n5 Signals From the Fed's Beige Book That Explain the Economy Right Now\nThe Federal Reserve's latest Beige Book delivered a somewhat brighter view of the U.S. economy, with most of the country reporting modest growth after several months of stagnation. But the most revealing insights weren't in the national summary. They were in the local details, which continue to show an economy growing unevenly and under pressure from high prices.\nThe Beige Book, published eight times a year, compiles anecdotal reports from businesses, banks, and community groups across the Fed's 12 districts. This month's report showed activity picking up slightly after three consecutive reports in which most districts reported little change. Fed officials described their outlooks as \"mildly optimistic,\" with expectations for modest growth in the months ahead.\nTrump Says Iran Has Stopped Killing Protesters\nPresident Trump on Wednesday said Iran had stopped killing antiregime protesters and wouldn't execute those it accused of trying to topple the government, appearing to narrow the possibility that the U.S. was about to launch military strikes against the country.\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump told reporters that the U.S. had been notified Iran had \"no plans to carry out any executions of protesters.\"\nTrump Not Persuaded to Abandon Greenland Pursuit After White House Talks\nTop officials from Denmark and Greenland said after a visit to the White House on Wednesday that they hadn't persuaded President Trump to abandon his ambitions to annex Greenland.\nVice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers at the White House in the midst of an extraordinary standoff between the U.S. and its closest allies over the future of the island of 57,000 people. Political leaders in Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom, have repeatedly insisted that their home isn't for sale after Trump's plans sparked blowback.\nJamie Dimon Seemed to Have Trump Figured Out-Until This Week\nJamie Dimon has worked carefully to rebuild his broken relationship with President Trump. The fight over Fed chair Jerome Powell is threatening to blow it up again.\nThe head of JPMorgan Chase, well-known for impassioned stances on policy, had tempered his approach with Trump over the past year, offering overall expressions of support with careful criticism of specific policy details. It appeared to be working-he had met with the president and White House officials several times to discuss economic policy in recent months.\nRio Tinto, BHP Join Forces to Unlock More Australian Iron Ore\nRio Tinto and BHP Group have agreed to work together on some new projects at neighboring iron-ore mines in Australia that could help bolster their future production of the steel ingredient.\nThe companies said that by collaborating on new projects at their neighboring Yandicoogina and Yandi iron-ore operations in Australia's Pilbara region, they could extract up to 200 million metric tons of iron ore, some of which might have otherwise been stranded.\nWrite to singaporeeditors@dowjones.com\nExpected Major Events for Thursday\n00:01/UK: Dec RICS Residential Market Survey\n05:30/NED: Dec Unemployment\n07:00/ROM: Nov Industrial production\n07:00/SWE: Dec CPI\n07:00/GER: Dec WPI\n07:00/NOR: Dec External trade in goods\n07:00/UK: Nov UK trade\n07:00/UK: Nov Index of production\n07:00/UK: Nov Index of services\n07:00/UK: Nov Monthly GDP estimates\n07:00/NOR: 4Q Business tendency survey\n07:45/FRA: Dec CPI\n08:00/CZE: Nov Retail trade\n08:00/SPN: Dec CPI\n08:00/SVK: Dec CPI\n08:00/SVK: Dec Core & net inflation development\n09:00/ITA: Nov Industrial Production\n09:00/GER: Annual GDP - first provisional calculation\n09:00/POL: Dec CPI\n09:00/BUL: Dec CPI\n09:30/UK: 4Q Bank of England Credit Conditions Survey\n09:30/UK: 4Q Bank of England Bank Liabilities Survey\n10:00/EU: Nov Industrial Production\n10:00/EU: Nov Foreign trade\n10:00/CRO: Dec CPI\n11:00/IRL: Nov Goods Exports and Imports\n11:00/ITA: Nov Foreign Trade EU\n11:00/IRL: Dec CPI\n11:00/FRA: Nov OECD Harmonised Unemployment Rates\n11:00/FRA: 3Q OECD Quarterly Labour Market Situation\n12:30/UK: Dec NIESR Monthly GDP Tracker\nAll times in GMT.
