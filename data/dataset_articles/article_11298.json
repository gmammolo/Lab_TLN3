  "text": "The recent intervention by U.S. lawmakers in Korea’s investigation of Coupang has been framed as a defense of fair trade and American enterprise. In reality, it reveals a deeper flaw in political reasoning, one that conflates lawful regulation with discrimination, and corporate nationality with immunity from accountability. What is being sold as principle increasingly looks like pretext.\nAt the center of the controversy are claims by several Republican members of Congress that Korea’s actions amount to “unfair treatment” or even “state-sponsored hostility” toward U.S. interests. Rep. Darrell Issa has characterized the investigation as discriminatory, while others have warned that Korea will “pay a price” for scrutinizing the company. Such rhetoric rests on a fundamental error. Regulatory enforcement in response to alleged misconduct, particularly involving large-scale data breaches and corporate governance failures, is not a trade barrier. It is a core function of a sovereign government.\nTo argue otherwise implies that multinational corporations should be exempt from local law simply because they are U.S.-owned. That proposition would hollow out the very notion of the rule of law and replace it with a hierarchy of privilege based on passport rather than conduct. Democracies cannot function, nor can fair trade endure, if legal accountability is subordinated to corporate nationality.\nThe lawmakers’ arguments also rely on false equivalence. By equating Coupang’s legal troubles with protectionist measures aimed at excluding U.S. firms, they obscure the crucial distinction between neutral enforcement and selective discrimination. There is no evidence that Korean authorities are targeting Coupang because of its U.S. ties. The investigation follows specific allegations: massive personal data leaks, questions surrounding industrial accident cover-ups and concerns over whether the company’s leadership has met its legal responsibilities. Scrutiny grounded in concrete allegations is not discrimination; portraying it as such is deflection.\nEqually troubling is the slippery slope fallacy suggesting that a single investigation will spiral into broader anti-American hostility. This claim is speculative and unsupported. Countries routinely regulate foreign firms without triggering diplomatic crises. Inflating routine governance into geopolitical provocation serves more to intimidate than to inquire.\nThe tone of the criticism has also descended into ad hominem attack. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald’s description of the investigation as a “witch hunt,” echoed by others including Reps. Adrian Smith and Carol Miller, sidesteps the substance of the allegations entirely. Labeling a legal process a witch hunt is a rhetorical shortcut that avoids the harder task of demonstrating procedural unfairness or selective enforcement, likely because such evidence is lacking.\nThe timing of this congressional activism invites further skepticism. With U.S. midterm elections approaching, vocal advocacy for corporate interests plays well with donors and industry groups. Coupang itself has spent more than $10 million in the past five years lobbying Congress and the executive branch. Many lawmakers also transition into lobbying roles after leaving office. None of this proves bad faith, but it does weaken claims of moral urgency and demands that such interventions be viewed through a political lens, not a purely principled one.\nPerhaps most conspicuous is what the lawmakers’ defenses omit. While they insist on protecting corporate rights, they remain silent on Coupang CEO Harold Rogers’ failure to comply with police summons and his subsequent departure from Korea following a National Assembly hearing. If fairness and due process were truly the concern, one would expect equal emphasis on cooperation with lawful investigations. Selective outrage only reinforces the perception that principles are being invoked unevenly.\nNone of this absolves Korean authorities of their own responsibility. To avoid diplomatic backlash while holding Coupang accountable, the government must proceed with meticulous fairness and coordination. Recent missteps, such as police requesting Rogers’ appearance after he had already left the country, undermine credibility and invite criticism. A firm but disciplined investigation is essential, not only to establish responsibility but also to withstand external pressure.\nUltimately, the fallacy underlying the U.S. lawmakers’ position is the assumption that corporate nationality should trump legal accountability. That is neither a sustainable trade doctrine nor a defensible democratic principle. Respect for allies means respecting their institutions, including their right and responsibility to enforce the law.\nIf Washington genuinely seeks to uphold a rules-based international order, it must resist the temptation to weaponize regulatory scrutiny for political or commercial ends. Otherwise, the language of “fairness” risks becoming little more than a shield for power, stripped of logic, consistency and credibility.",
