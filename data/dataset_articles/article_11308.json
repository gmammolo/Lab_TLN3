  "text": "Asian markets exhibited a generally downward trend, reflecting a shift in investor sentiment following a decline on Wall Street. U.S. futures also mirrored this downturn, with significant repercussions felt in the technology sector. The retreat was particularly evident in Big Tech stocks, which weighed heavily on overall market performance.\nIn commodities, oil prices experienced a notable drop of more than $2 a barrel. This decline was in part influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that he had received credible information indicating that plans for executions in Iran had been halted. This news arrived despite Tehran’s indications of imminent trials and executions as part of their crackdown on domestic protests. As a result, U.S. benchmark crude fell 3.3% to $59.88 a barrel, while the international standard, Brent crude, decreased by 3.2% to $64.40.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo dropped 0.9% to 53,863.84, with various technology-related stocks contributing to the loss. Key players in the tech sector saw significant declines: SoftBank Group fell 5.6%, Advantest decreased by 4.1%, and Tokyo Electron dipped 3.3%. Conversely, shares of Toyota Industries surged by 6% following reports that Toyota Motor had increased its buyout offer for the company to 18,800 yen ($118.61) per share.\nMeanwhile, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 0.6% to 26,850.78. This drop was exacerbated by the more than 20% plunge in shares of Trip.com, a Chinese online travel platform, after Beijing announced an antitrust investigation into the group. The Shanghai Composite index also saw a decrease of 0.6%, landing at 4,101.52.\nOn a brighter note, South Korea’s Kospi recorded a 0.5% increase to 4,747.85, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.3% to 8,851.00. However, Taiwan’s Taiex fell 0.6%, with its leading chip maker, TSMC, anticipated to announce strong quarterly profits later on Thursday.\nFutures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down by 0.1%. On the previous day, the S&P 500 closed down 0.5% at 6,926.60, marking its second consecutive loss, while the Dow Jones slipped 0.1% to 49,149.63. The Nasdaq composite witnessed a 1% decrease, ending at 23,471.75. The decline in Big Tech stocks was significant as many investors reassessed their positions amid concerns of overvaluation and diminishing excitement surrounding artificial intelligence advancements.\nIn the banking sector, shares took a hit with Wells Fargo reporting a disappointing quarterly profit, causing its stock to tumble 4.6%. Bank of America and Citigroup followed suit with decreases of 3.8% and 3.3%, respectively. Notably, oil company stocks provided some support to the S&P 500; Exxon Mobil rose by 2.9%, and Chevron saw a 2.1% increase.\nAmid heightened geopolitical uncertainties, investors gravitated toward safe-haven assets. Although gold prices fell by 0.8%, they remained close to previous record levels. In the bond market, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond decreased to 4.14%, down from 4.18%, as investments deemed safer attracted increased interest.\nEarly trading revealed the dollar rising to 158.63 Japanese yen from 158.46 yen, while the euro traded at $1.1636, down from $1.1645. The fluctuating dynamics of both markets and commodities indicate a complex interplay of investor reactions to macroeconomic factors, including geopolitical events and corporate performance.",
