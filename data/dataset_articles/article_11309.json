  "text": "Homebuyers and existing mortgage holders in Australia are grappling with a significant increase in fixed home loan rates, following a substantial hike from the Commonwealth Bank, the nation’s largest financial institution. This increase is likened to a three-time hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia, adding hundreds of dollars to typical mortgage repayments.\nEffective immediately, the Commonwealth Bank has raised its fixed interest rates by as much as 0.70 percentage points. For instance, its three-year fixed rate surged from 5.34% to 6.04%, impacting those who previously secured lower rates. The one-year fixed rate experienced a 0.45-point increase to 5.94%, nearly double the amount of a standard adjustment from the Reserve Bank. Additionally, the bank’s fixed loan options now start at a rate of 5.79% for a two-year term, while its four- and five-year terms increased by 0.30 points to 6.09% and 6.24%, respectively.\nMacquarie Bank has followed suit, announcing its second rate hike in just six weeks, increasing fixed terms by 0.25 percentage points. This trend of rising rates is concerning as a notable 34 lenders have implemented at least one fixed rate hike in the past month, indicating a broader shift across the lending landscape in anticipation of a potential cash rate increase from the Reserve Bank during its upcoming meeting.\nCanstar analysis highlights that merely a 0.25-point rise in interest rates translates to a monthly repayment increase of approximately $90 for a standard $600,000 mortgage. For larger loans, such as $750,000 and $1 million, the increases would be around $112 and $150 per month, respectively.\nSally Tindall, Director of Data Insights at Canstar, emphasized the adverse effects on borrowers who hesitated to lock in their rates earlier. She noted that the Commonwealth Bank’s lowest fixed rates now exceed those of its major competitors across all loan terms. “Last year, CBA’s two-year special rate was 4.99%. Today, their lowest rate stands at an unappealing 5.79%,” Tindall stated.\nWhile most borrowers are currently on variable rates, there remains a sense of urgency among those contemplating fixed rates, as Tindall remarked on the diminishing availability of competitive fixed rates. Despite this, she pointed out that there are still some smaller lenders offering rates below 5%, such as Pacific Mortgage Group and Geelong Bank, with one-year fixed rates starting at 4.99%. Yet, the future of these lower rates is uncertain, particularly in light of the forthcoming RBA meeting.\nAmong the major banks, the National Australia Bank (NAB) now offers the most competitive fixed rates, providing options at 5.39% for both one-year and two-year terms, which is significantly lower than the rates of the Commonwealth Bank.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia’s decision on interest rates is expected to be announced on February 3, with many in the market watching closely for its impact on borrowing costs and overall economic conditions.",
