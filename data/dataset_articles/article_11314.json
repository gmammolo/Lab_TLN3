  "text": "Poole Town Ladies manager Nobby Lovelass has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of the club, pointing to ongoing financial pressures within grassroots women’s football.\nDespite competing at the highest level reached by any women’s side in Dorset, The Dolphins continue to operate with limited resources.\nWhen asked about the challenges facing the club, Lovelass suggested the issues extended beyond Poole Town and reflect wider structural problems within the women’s game.\n“The ladies struggle a lot; I think the women’s game in general struggles.”\nThe team currently play in the South West Women’s Regional League Premier Division, a level that requires regular travel, consistent training provision and investment across the squad.\nLovelass indicated that increased support from within the wider club structure could help ease some of the pressure, particularly as the women’s game continues to attract more attention locally and nationally.\nHe voiced the difficulty grassroots clubs face when attempting to access financial support, despite the existence of national funding streams.\n“There are grants out there, but they don’t seem to come down far enough. They don’t come down to grassroots.”\nAccording to Lovelass, even support from the County FAs can only go so far when clubs lack the infrastructure required to qualify for funding.\nOne of the biggest problems for The Dolphins is the absence of a permanent home ground, which Lovelass believes limits the club’s ability to grow and invest sustainably.\nFounded in the late 1980s, Poole Town Ladies are one of Dorset’s longest-running women’s teams and operate a development pathway from youth to senior football.\nRecent seasons have brought progress on the pitch, including promotion back to the South West Women’s Regional League Premier Division, but Lovelass believes off-field support must now catch up.\n“There are businesses out there that could qualify and give something to the women’s game, the FA definitely.”\nParticipation in women’s football continues to rise across the region, but Lovelass warns that without sustained backing, clubs like Poole Town risk being left behind despite growing interest in the sport.",
