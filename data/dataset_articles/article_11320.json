  "text": "Record rents hit Australia as Greens blame Labor for ‘out of control’ crisis\nRental prices have hit record highs across Australia, with a prominent Greens figure blaming Labor’s housing policies for fuelling the crisis.\nAccording to research by Domain, Australian rental prices have peaked in every capital city but Melbourne, with Sydney now averaging $800 a week as the country’s most expensive city to rent in.\n“Record high rents across the country are further proof of a housing crisis out of control,” said Greens Senator Barbara Pocock.\nMs Pocock said the federal Labor government’s capital gains tax and negative gearing policies were “tax breaks for wealthy investors” that “lock out first home buyers from the market and force rent prices to skyrocket”.\n“Renters are literally paying the price for a landlord’s market,” she said.\n“This government needs to treat housing as a human right instead of giving billions of tax breaks to wealthy property investors.”\n“This is a system stacked against younger generations and people who haven’t won the intergenerational housing lottery.”\nTo target the housing crisis, Labor created its $10bn Housing Australia Future Fund and has built more than 5,000 social and affordable homes with Commonwealth investment since 2022.\nIt also introduced the Help to Buy Scheme that aims to help first home buyers enter the market.\nThose eligible for the scheme can co-purchase a property with the government, which will foot up to 40 per cent of the purchase price for new homes, or 30 per cent for existing homes.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers recently said he backed Labor’s “ambitious yet achievable” housing target of building 1.2 million new, well-located homes by July 2029 as part of their plan to relieve the housing crisis.\nHowever the Greens are advocating for immediate relief, asking the government to introduce rent caps to directly combat the rental crisis.\nOriginally published as Record rents hit Australia as Greens blame Labor for ‘out of control’ crisis\nReal Estate",
