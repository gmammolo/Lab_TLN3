  "text": "More Australians are ‘job hugging’ as confidence in the job market collapses\nFearful Australians are refusing to leave jobs that are no longer suitable, as weakening economy and the rise of AI has started a new career trend known as “job hugging”.\nA LinkedIn survey of 2000 people has found 59 per cent of Australians plan to stay in the same job in 2026, as confidence in the job market fades.\nAccording to those surveyed, economic uncertainty is the top reason Australians are reluctant to change jobs, while nearly seven in 10 say finding a new job has become harder due to increased competition.\nFour in five people say they are “unprepared” to find a new job, while a third say they are wary of the role AI will play in their potential job hunt.\nLinkedIn career expert Brendan Wong says weary Australians are now looking to hold onto their current jobs.\n“We are seeing people are just trying to stay put instead of joining the increased competition and getting a new role,” he told NewsWire.\n“The job market is tougher, there is more competition for fewer jobs and I think AI is shaping that.”\nMr Wong points out that while Australia’s employees have gone from a period of “great resignation” to “job hugging” it might not be a win for employers.\n“For employers, with people choosing to stay even if they don’t like the job, it becomes important that they pay attention,” he said.\n“It is easy to say more people are choosing to stay, but employers need to address what is underlying that.”\n“That could be providing opportunities for upskilling, internal mobility, so give them opportunities if your talent is going to stay”.\nThe research also notes artificial intelligence is having a greater impact on Australians, with employers increasingly looking for skills in the area.\nSuch is the change, leaders are increasingly hiring Australians who may be less experienced but have AI skills.\n“A year or two ago AI was nice to have, but now we are seeing it move from something niche into the mainstream, so people that want to get ahead should be levelling up their abilities in AI,” Mr Wong said.\n“On top of that it is also really focused on the things AI can’t do that makes people human, such as communication skills, problem solving and creativity, those things are coming to the forefront.”\nMr Wong says Australians looking for a new job in 2026, should focus on upskilling particularly in AI.\n“It is very important to learn how to use the different AI tools, as it applies to both doing your work, but also using it in the job search aspect,” he said.\nOne in two Australians say AI tools would make them feel more prepared heading into an interview.\nAI is also helping to ease nerves, with 36 per cent saying AI‑led interviews would make them feel less nervous, rising to 43 per cent among Gen Z.\nDespite the overall fears many Australians have, the employment social media platform points out there are a number of roles that are currently on the rise.\nThese include AI engineers, director of artificial intelligence and chief risk officer top the list. Roles supporting infrastructure and the energy transition remain in demand including mechanical engineers and head of environment roles.\nMore humanised jobs are still available in mental health and organisational change are also prominent, with psychotherapists and organisational development managers ranking among the fastest-growing roles.\nOriginally published as More Australians are ‘job hugging’ as confidence in the job market collapses\nBusiness",
