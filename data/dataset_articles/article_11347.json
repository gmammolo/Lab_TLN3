  "text": "Binance's spot cryptocurrency trading market share has dropped to 25%, the lowest level since early 2021\nJan 15, 2026 13:29:56\nAccording to Bloomberg, CoinDesk data shows that Binance's market share in the cryptocurrency spot trading has dropped to 25%, the lowest level since 2021, far below the nearly 60% peak in 2023.\nIts market share in derivatives trading has also fallen from a peak of nearly 70% to about 35%. Analysts point out that trading activity flowing out of Binance is primarily shifting to non-U.S. exchanges such as Bybit, HTX, and Gate, while trading volume at U.S. exchanges, including Coinbase, has seen relatively limited growth. Meanwhile, on-chain trading platforms like Hyperliquid are attracting more derivatives trading, indicating a profound shift in market structure.\nRelated Projects\nLatest News\nThe Manhattan District Attorney urges New York State lawmakers to classify unlicensed cryptocurrency businesses as a criminal offense\nChainCatcher\n1月 15, 2026 13:13:56\nA blockchain company plans to promote a $200 million tokenized water project in Asia, with the first stop in Jakarta\nChainCatcher\n1月 15, 2026 12:56:53\nGSX will launch a water treatment plant asset tokenization project in Indonesia, aiming to raise 35 million USD\nChainCatcher\n1月 15, 2026 12:55:04\nFact Check: How Much Did the University of Chicago Lose in Cryptocurrency Trading?\nChainCatcher\n1月 15, 2026 12:42:01\nData: BTC breaks through 96,000 USD\nChainCatcher\n1月 15, 2026 12:27:42",
