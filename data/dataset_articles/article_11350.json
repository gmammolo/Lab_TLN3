  "text": "Trinity Audioplayer ready...\nFor Massachusetts businesses, it looks like another bumpy ride.\nAs the calendar flipped to 2026, the state’s employers entered the new year with the same lack of confidence they had expressed for most of 2025.\nOne concrete measure of that pessimistic sentiment, the Associated Industries of Massachusetts’ business confidence index, fell 1.7 points in December — the fourth lowest score of the year — marking the 10th consecutive month that the pulse of the economic climate has recorded a negative reading.\nThe last time the index indicated neutrality or confidence occurred in February 2025 with a rating of 50.4.\nThis scale reflects confidence — or lack of — in the state’s vitality. It’s overseen by a council of economists and business leaders well aware of Massachusetts market conditions.\nBusinesses’ concerns about rising costs, permitting red tape and the outflow of working people from Massachusetts to more affordable states were offset somewhat by positive signs in the economy, according to the survey of more than 140 employers.\n“Consumer spending has remained relatively resilient, supported by steady job growth, rising real wages in some sectors, and strong balance sheets among higher-income households,” Sara Johnson, AIM Board of Economic Advisors chair, said in a statement released Monday accompanying the new index numbers.\n“Corporate investment, particularly in technology and artificial intelligence, continues to provide pockets of momentum. These factors suggest an economy that is slowing but still expanding, avoiding the downturn many feared earlier.”\nThat sanguine view would seem to be at odds with the AIM findings.\nThe December index reading — 46.8 on a 100-point scale — noticeably trailed the 55.4 recorded at the end of 2024.\nThe confidence index hit a recent low of 41.5 last April.\nAIM said its Massachusetts (39.6) and US indices (40.1) are both down more than 15 points from a year ago.\nAIM President and CEO Brooke Thomson identified data security, rising health care and energy costs as ongoing business concerns.\n“Add in the possibility that voters may face as many as 11 statewide ballot questions in the fall, and there are many potential issues that are likely to affect business confidence this year,” Thomson said.\nModest gains in science-based sector aside, the general aura of pessimism found in the AIM index is representative of a two-tiered economy, in which high-tech industries exert a disproportionate influence over how we judge the state’s overall business health.\nMost of the state’s workforce — and the businesses that employ them — don’t benefit from corporate advances in emerging technologies.\nThey’re more Main Street — the businesses the AIM index primarily measures.\nProceed with caution in open burning season\nThe lack of snow cover allows us an opportunity to assess the results of several windy winter days.\nFallen branches, limbs, and twigs that might have remained out of sight instead present an opportunity to dispose of that refuse.\nBut since municipal recycling collections have long ceased, burning that debris might be your only solution.\nIf that’s the case, you’re in luck.\nOpen burning season in Massachusetts begins today.\nThe window for that permitted activity runs from Jan. 15 through May 1.\nBut just because it’s open season, that doesn’t mean anything goes.\nState laws and the Massachusetts Comprehensive Fire Safety Code govern when and under what conditions open burning is allowed.\nSeveral cities and towns, including Lowell, Arlington, Belmont, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Chicopee, Everett, Fall River, Holyoke, Lawrence, Malden, Medford, New Bedford, Newton, Somerville, Springfield, Waltham, Watertown, West Springfield, and Worcester prohibit open burning altogether.\nAnd even in communities that do allow the practice, local fire departments may deny a permit or set additional limitations if circumstances dictate.\nThere’s also a limit on what material qualifies.\nOnly certain items can be burned, including brush, cane, driftwood, residential forestry debris, fruit tree and bush prunings, raspberry stalks, infected bee hives, trees and brush from agricultural land clearing, and fungus-infected elm wood.\nIt’s illegal to burn leaves, grass, hay, stumps, tires, household trash, construction materials, demolition debris, or brush, trees, cane, or driftwood from commercial or industrial land clearing.\nThose seeking permits should contact their local fire departments or the Mass.gov website for a complete list of acceptable materials.\nOpen burning can only occur:\n• With a permit issued in advance by the local fire department;\n• From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;\n• At least 75 feet from all dwellings and without causing a nuisance;\n• As close as possible to the source of material being burned;\n• Without using gasoline, kerosene, or other accelerants to start the fire.\n• When it won’t cause or contribute to air pollution.\nOther safety tips:\n• Extinguish the fire if winds pick up or the weather changes.\n• If the fire gets out of control, call 9-1-1 immediately.\nThose who burn unlawfully or allow a fire to grow out of control could be held liable for firefighting costs, face fines, or even jail time.\nAnd be aware of the overall environment.\nThe recent weeks of cold, blustery weather have contributed to dry conditions.\nAs a result, the Northeast Region, which accounts for most of our communities, has recently been categorized by Energy and Environmental Affairs as being in a Level 2 — significant drought.\nKeep that in mind when thoroughly extinguishing whatever you’ve burned.",
