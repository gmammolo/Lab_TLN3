  "text": "Shareholders who suffered losses in the so-called \"Invossa-K Inj. scandal\" filed a damages lawsuit against Kolon TissueGene and former Kolon Group Chairman Lee Woong-yeol but lost.The Civil Division 30 of the Seoul Central District Court (Presiding Judge Kim Seok-beom) on the 15th ruled against the plaintiffs in a damages suit of about 8.6 billion won filed by more than 500 shareholders against Kolon TissueGene, former Kolon Group Chairman Lee Woong-yeol, NH Investment & Securities and others.The court said it reached this conclusion in light of rulings in similar cases. Last month, the court also ruled against the plaintiffs in a damages suit of about 6.4 billion won filed by some 170 affected shareholders. At the time, the court said, \"Even if the component changed, the efficacy did not change or its particular harmfulness did not change, and it was not a case of falsely stating or omitting matters important to investment decisions.\"Invossa, developed by Kolon TissueGene, the U.S. subsidiary of Kolon Life Science, was initially approved in 2017 by the Ministery of Food and Drug Safety as a gene therapy for osteoarthritis containing human chondrocytes. But in Mar. 2019 it was revealed that one of the main components was not chondrocytes but kidney cells (293-derived cells), leading to the cancellation of approval and a steep drop in the stock price amid the fallout.In response, shareholders filed multiple lawsuits, saying Kolon TissueGene and Kolon Life Science made false disclosures despite recognizing that Invossa’s main component had changed.In connection with this incident, Kolon TissueGene’s management and executives were also acquitted in separate criminal trials.Kolon Honorary Chairman Lee Woong-yeol was indicted in Jul. 2020 on charges including manufacturing and selling Invossa with a component different from the approved one—the \"kidney-derived cell\" component—from Nov. 2017 to Mar. 2019, generating 16 billion won in sales, but was acquitted at the first trial on Nov. 2024. The court said it was difficult to see intent or concealment.Kolon Life Science CEO Lee Woo-seok, Kolon TissueGene Korea branch head Kwon Soon-uk, and Kolon Life Science Executive Director Yang Yoon-cheol, who were tried together, were also all acquitted.",
