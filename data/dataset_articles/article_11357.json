  "text": "By Megan Cheah\nSingapore's private home sales slid in December as project launches cooled over the holiday period, but annual sales hit their highest level since 2021.\nDevelopers sold 197 units, excluding executive condominiums, last month, down from 325 units sold in November, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said Thursday. That compared with 203 units sold in December 2024.\nFor the full year, 10,821 units were sold, excluding executive condominiums, according to estimates by real-estate services provider Huttons, the highest since 2021.\nThere could be up to 27 new private residential launches in 2026, with around 11,171 units, said Mark Yip, chief executive of Huttons Asia.\nWong Shanting, research head at real-estate services company Newmark, said sales momentum will likely resume in January, before the market takes a breather in February due to the Lunar New Year.\nProjects in locations that haven't had recent launches could benefit from pent-up demand, Wong said. \"At the same time, there are concerns that an overly exuberant market could prompt some degree of policy intervention,\" she said.\nNewmark forecasts private new home sales, excluding executive condominiums, to reach between 8,500 and 9,500 units in 2026. Huttons' projected range is 8,000 to 10,000 units.\nWrite to Megan Cheah at megan.cheah@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n01-15-26 0051ET\n© Dow Jones - 2026",
