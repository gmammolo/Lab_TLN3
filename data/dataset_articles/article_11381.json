  "text": "Industry- 1 min read\n74% of S'pore leaders rank geopolitical uncertainty as top business risk\nGeopolitical uncertainty has emerged as the top business risk for Singapore leaders, overtaking economic growth for the first time, according to Russell Reynolds’ H2 2025 Global Leadership Monitor. While leaders feel prepared for technology and regulation, confidence in managing geopolitical risk remains low. The shift is reshaping leadership priorities, talent strategies and executive mobility amid rising regional tensions.\nSingapore business leadersare now more concerned about\ngeopolitical uncertaintythan economic growth, marking a significant shift in leadership priorities, according to the H2 2025 Global Leadership Monitor from\nRussell Reynolds Associates.\nFor the first time, geopolitics has overtaken growth as the primary concern for leaders in Singapore. Nearly three-quarters (74%) now rank\ngeopolitical uncertaintyas the country’s number one threat, up sharply from fourth place in H2 2024. Uncertain economic growth (53%) and trade conflicts (50%) complete the top three risks, with trade tensions seeing one of the steepest rises, moving from eighth place to third. This contrasts with broader Asia-Pacific and global trends, where trade conflicts rank far lower, underlining Singapore’s heightened exposure to regional and global tensions.\nDespite this shift, leadership confidence remains uneven. While 56% of leaders feel prepared to manage technological change and 63% say they are ready for tighter regulation, only 38% feel confident navigating geopolitical uncertainty. As focus intensifies on external risks, traditional workforce concerns such as access to key talent, skills shortages and changing consumer behaviour have fallen down leaders’ priority lists.\nTechnology and AIare reshaping leadership pipelines, but adoption lags. In Singapore, 71% of leaders believe AI and automation in hiring and talent mobility will have the greatest impact on leadership availability over the next year. Three in four view generative AI as a critical future skill, yet only 20% use AI in daily work, with internal capability gaps cited as the main barrier.\nStrategic thinking has emerged as the most critical leadership capability, prioritised by 63% of Singapore leaders, well above innovation, creativity and technical literacy. Meanwhile, executives remain industry-loyal, with 83% open to moves within their sector but cautious about cross-industry transitions, even as 67% signal readiness to leave their current employer amid ongoing uncertainty.",
