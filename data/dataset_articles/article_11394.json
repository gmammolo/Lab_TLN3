  "text": "The shadow economy is economic activity that is not reflected in official statistics and on which taxes are not paid in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\"Latvia has been paying increased attention to the shadow economy since 2010, periodically developing and implementing separate plans to curb the shadow economy,\" said Inga Vilka, a member of the State Audit Office Council.\nFrom 2014 to the end of 2022, the Shadow Economy Combating Council operated under the leadership of the Prime Minister. In 2023, the Saeima established the Shadow Economy Combating Subcommittee of the Budget and Finance (Tax) Committee. The Ministry of Finance (FM) has taken on a leading role in shadow economy issues and coordination of its reduction, establishing a separate department in 2017.\nAssessing the size of the shadow economy is complex and is done using various methods. The latest available estimates of the shadow economy in Latvia vary significantly and indicate that its size can be estimated at between 7% and just over 20% of gross domestic product (GDP).\nIn Latvia, the central instrument for curbing the shadow economy is the Shadow Economy Curbing Plan. In 2024, the fourth plan for 2024–2027 was launched with the aim of reducing the share of the shadow economy from 19.9% to 18.9% of GDP by 2027. The audit concluded that no significant improvement is expected.\nIn addition to horizontal measures, the plan identifies two priority sectors – construction and health. In the audit, when assessing the justification for the selection of these sectors, the auditors concluded that the prevalence of the shadow economy in the health sector is relatively low, while sectors with a significantly higher shadow economy have been left out of the plan. Measures to reduce the shadow economy in the construction sector have been implemented over a long time, and the size of the shadow economy in the sector has fallen, but it is still considered to be high. In the opinion of the auditors, the measures provided for in the plan will not reduce the causes of the shadow economy in construction.\nThe auditors concluded that the plan does not sufficiently utilise research findings, which show that taxes are the most effective driver of the shadow economy. Although the Ministry of Finance has worked on tax policy guidelines, Latvia still lacks a clear long-term vision for the development of tax policy.\nThe State Audit Office believes that a predictable tax policy is a prerequisite for both economic development and reducing the shadow economy.\n\"At a time when the country is making great efforts to identify and, hopefully, implement ways to reduce bureaucracy and administrative burdens, some of the measures in the plan to curb the shadow economy are moving in the opposite direction, namely, strengthening requirements and control mechanisms. This is a battle against the consequences, not the causes. Studies show that as prosperity and trust levels increase, the shadow economy usually decreases,\" said the member of the State Audit Office Council.\nThe VK has made one recommendation to the FM – to review the state's approach to curbing the shadow economy, base decisions and communication on comprehensive and long-term data, reduce bureaucracy, and focus on eliminating the causes of the shadow economy.",
