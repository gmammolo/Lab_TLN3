  "text": "Extra costs and the use of public resources may be incurred under the Hong Kong government’s proposed moves to increase professional scrutiny of building maintenance projects following the deadly Tai Po inferno, a lawmaker has said, calling for further discussion.\\nElection Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam Siu-lo, a town planner by training, said on Thursday that expanding the Urban Renewal Authority’s (URA) role in such projects might require extra time and money, urging the government and legislature to discuss the proposals’ implementation details in greater depth.\\n“We have reached consensus on strengthening supervision and providing more assistance to individual homeowners, but discussions are still lacking regarding the costs of the new measures,” he told a radio programme.\\nAt the first meeting of the new Legislative Council term on Wednesday, government officials outlined a series of measures to reform regulatory mechanisms for building maintenance projects and crack down on bid-rigging.\\nSuch measures were proposed in response to the deadly blaze in Wang Fuk Court of Tai Po in late November, which claimed at least 161 lives and displaced around 5,000 residents.\\nAccording to preliminary investigations, non-fire-retardant scaffolding mesh and polyfoam boards, applied to protect windows during renovation, were blamed for the rapid spread of the fire.\\nAfter the inferno, rumours of bid-rigging surfaced as the project budget ballooned from HK$152 million in September 2023 to HK$336 million last year when the owners’ corporation opted for the most expensive option.\\n\\nAmong the suggestions, the government sought to involve the URA, which mainly handles urban renewal and redevelopment projects, in the tendering and assessment processes for homeowners.\\nProperty owners would also be required to hire consultants independent of contractors to oversee project progress, according to the proposals.\\nFor buildings applying for government maintenance subsidies, property owners would have to accept contractors and consultants appointed by the URA.\\nFor those which do not, the authority would still advise homeowners on which parties should win the bids.\\nLam added that the government and legislature should also consider whether the URA had sufficient manpower and resources to scrutinise all maintenance projects, warning that the longer review process could delay urgent cases.\\n“The URA has already been saying they are running out of resources just conducting their current tasks and that they have to slow down,” he said.\\n“If we are really to involve URA in [tendering and assessment], I am expecting the government to grant it extra funds through the coming budget.”\\nLam said more attention should be given to “three-nil” buildings, those without an owners’ corporation, residents’ organisation, or property management firm.\\n“What we discussed [on Wednesday] mainly focused on buildings with owners’ corporations. But for those without, maintenance projects can only proceed when all owners give unanimous consent, meaning such projects are rarely carried out,” he said.\\n“I think this is the biggest loophole and we should fill in the gap as soon as possible.”\\nSpeaking on the same show, Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang Ka-piu expressed support for the proposed measure, saying it would help ease the burden on management committee members of owners’ corporations, who often lack professional engineering knowledge.\\n“After the Wang Fuk Court inferno, many owners’ corporations are at a loss as they are afraid of doing anything wrong … and many people choose not to participate in such affairs, leaving vacuum spaces for unscrupulous people and making residents distrust the system,” he said.\\nTang conceded that the measures would bring extra costs to homeowners, but said residents should be willing to pay more for higher levels of safety.\\nBut he noted that many residents had recently complained about some owners’ corporations rushing to push through major maintenance projects, apparently to avoid stricter regulations that would soon take effect.\\n“I hope enforcement agencies would identify such organisations that expedite the commencement of maintenance projects in the coming half a year and impose more preventive measures,” he said.\\nSeparately, education sector lawmaker Tang Fei called for more mental health support for students, fearing that memories of the inferno could resurface when details of the investigation were widely reported in the coming months.\\n“We need professional but low-profile support for them,” he said, referring to the fact that such tasks should be largely left to professionals.\\n“But attention from society should be refrained. Do not remind them of [potential mental pressure] every now and then, and turn our attention into another form of pressure.”\\n",
