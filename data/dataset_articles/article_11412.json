  "text": "LOGAN — As Americans look to improve their finances in the new year, a new report shows Utah residents weathered the past year’s nationwide credit score decline better than nearly every other state.\nAccording to a new analysis from WalletHub, average credit scores fell in all 50 states between the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2025. Utah ranked 50th overall, meaning it experienced one of the smallest declines in the nation.\nWalletHub found Utah’s average credit score dipped by just 0.14% during that period. The state’s average score stood at 690 in Q3 2025, remaining within the “good” credit range and well above the national average in many states.\nThe report comes as financial improvement tops many New Year’s resolution lists, even as rising living costs, higher insurance premiums and inflation continue to strain household budgets across the country.\nBy comparison, Missouri recorded the largest average credit score drop nationwide, falling from 664 to 654 — a score that ranks in the fair credit range, WalletHub said.\nIdaho credit scores dropped 0.87% to a score of 681, tied for 20th nationally.\nWalletHub analysts say maintaining on-time payments and managing credit card balances remain the most effective ways to protect and improve credit scores. Keeping credit utilization below 30% of available limits and paying down long-term debt are key factors in avoiding larger score declines.\nExperts also emphasize budgeting as a foundational tool for long-term credit health. Tracking income and expenses and living within one’s means can help households avoid missed payments and high balances, which can erode credit scores over time.\nWalletHub’s full report, including rankings for all 50 states and additional expert commentary, is available online.",
