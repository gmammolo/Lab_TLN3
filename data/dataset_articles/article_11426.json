  "text": "Thailand has intensified its oversight of USDT trading after discovering that foreign users account for approximately 40% of sellers on local platforms. The Bank of Thailand has begun treating stablecoin transactions with the same scrutiny as cash, gold, and digital wallet transfers, aligning with existing financial monitoring rules. This move is part of a broader strategy to mitigate risks associated with untracked fund flows and grey money.
