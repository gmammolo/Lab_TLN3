  "text": "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has urged New York state legislators to criminalize unlicensed cryptocurrency operations to combat money laundering and organized crime. Bragg emphasized the need for mandatory licensing and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements for all crypto businesses, highlighting unlicensed crypto ATMs as potential facilitators of anonymous currency exchanges for illicit funds. He also expressed support for legislative measures to enhance the recovery of stolen crypto assets, advocating for strict enforcement and criminal penalties for non-compliance.",
