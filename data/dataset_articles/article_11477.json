  "text": "The Ministry of Health has purchased \"Forsigi\" six times LESS than what diabetics in Yekaterinburg need\nThe Ministry of Health has purchased \"Forsigi\" six times LESS than what diabetics in Yekaterinburg need. This was told to Ural Mash in the state pharmacy \"Pharmacy\".\nPharmacists say it all depends on quotas: they claimed one quantity, but they prescribed the drug several times more. The supplies are small — the tablets are disassembled almost immediately. It's the same story with other discounted medicines. If anyone doesn't remember, the problem surfaced on a direct line with the president — at the same time, the Ministry of Health reported that everything was fine with free drugs.\nWe toured the state libraries to check the availability of \"Forsiga\". In five points it is not present at all. On March 8, they replied that they had and immediately closed the window. There are only three packs on Kuznetsov Street, and just a few on Volgogradskaya Street. The most stable stock is at Academician Schwartz, Rizhskaya, and at the new hospital on Decembrists.\nThe Ural Mash Ministry of Health said that everything was in order and there were no complaints. If there is a shortage somewhere, we are ready to deal with it. They added that 44,000 packages of Forsiga are currently stored in the warehouses and pharmacies of Pharmacy.",
