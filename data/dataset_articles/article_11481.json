  "text": "In particular, train fares will rise by an average of 6.6%, while bus fares will increase by approximately 7.5%. The cost of travel between zones will increase by 30 cents for both trains and buses, except for trips in zone A. At the same time, on trains outside electrified zones and buses outside zones, the fare for all stops will increase by 20 cents. For example, the ticket price for the train route Riga–Imanta will remain at 1.5 euros, while the price for the Riga–Sigulda route will rise from 2.5 to 2.8 euros. In turn, the ticket price for the bus and train on the Riga–Dubulti route will increase from two to 2.3 euros. The ticket for the train route Riga–Liepaja will rise by 20 cents — from 8.9 to 9.1 euros, the ticket for the Riga–Salaspils train will increase by 30 cents (from two to 2.3 euros), and for the Riga–Aizkraukle route — also by 30 cents (from 3.5 to 3.8 euros). The bus ticket for the Liepaja–Grobiņa route will increase by 20 cents — from one to 1.2 euros, on the Kombuli–Kazanova route — by 20 cents (from 70 to 90 cents), and on the Riga–Rezekne route — by 20 cents (from 11.7 to 11.9 euros). Tickets purchased before Wednesday, January 14, will be valid until the expiration date indicated on them, while starting from January 15, all tickets will be sold at the new rates. At the same time, the ATD emphasized that all travel benefits for socially protected groups of passengers on regional routes remain fully intact (100%), the procedure for using transport does not change, and discounts on subscription tickets remain in effect. Fares are reviewed regularly, at least once a year, taking into account the accumulated level of inflation and changes in average wages compared to the previous period. It was previously reported that in December 2023, the Public Transport Council approved a new ticket and fare system in regional public transport. As part of this, new fares and types of tickets came into effect in regional transport on April 1, 2024. At that time, the minimum fare in Riga was set at 1.5 euros, in other cities — one euro, and outside cities — 70 cents. At the same time, the price of a train trip on the Riga–Liepaja route increased from 7.4 to 8.9 euros, and by bus — from 8.65 to 10.4 euros. The previous fare system for regional public transport in Latvia had been in effect since 2020. The ATD is the executor of the unified state policy in the field of international transport, licensing of commercial road transport, as well as planning public transport.",
