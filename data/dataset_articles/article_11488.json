  "text": "With a price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 39.8x Hexagon AB (publ) (STO:HEXA B) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in Sweden have P/E ratios under 22x and even P/E's lower than 15x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\nWhile the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Hexagon's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n See our latest analysis for Hexagon\nfree report on Hexagon.\nIs There Enough Growth For Hexagon?\nIn order to justify its P/E ratio, Hexagon would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 33%. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 21% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.\nShifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 26% each year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 20% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\nWith this information, we can see why Hexagon is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.\nThe Key Takeaway\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\nWe've established that Hexagon maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\nYou should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted 1 warning sign for Hexagon you should be aware of.\nIf you're unsure about the strength of Hexagon's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.\nValuation is complex, but we're here to simplify it.\nDiscover if Hexagon might be undervalued or overvalued with our detailed analysis, featuring fair value estimates, potential risks, dividends, insider trades, and its financial condition.\nAccess Free Analysis\nHave feedback on this article?
