  "text": "Extreme Cold Warnings were issued for large swaths of the province on Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Environment and Climate Change Canada warnings cover a large area extending across the northern part of the province and another area extending from north of Edmonton and through central and southern Alberta and east into Saskatchewan.\nWind chills as low as -40 C were expected overnight Thursday, says the warning issued at 3:37 p.m.\n\"Wind chills will moderate as temperatures rise during the day on Friday. However, extreme cold conditions may return Friday evening for some areas as temperatures drop and winds pick up,\" says Environment Canada.\nMeteorologists warn that extreme cold puts everyone at risk.\nRisks are greater for young children, older adults, people with chronic illnesses, people working or exercising outdoors, and those without proper shelter.\nPeople should cover up and watch for cold-related symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, muscle pain and weakness, numbness and colour change in fingers and toes.\nFrostbite can develop within minutes on exposed skin, especially with wind chill.\nExtreme cold warnings are issued when very cold temperatures or wind chill creates an elevated risk to health such as frost bite and hypothermia.\nPeople should continue to monitor alerts and forecasts issued by Environment Canada. To report severe weather, send an email to [ABstorm@ec.gc.ca](mailto:ABstorm@ec.gc.ca) or tweet reports using [#ABStorm](https://twitter.com/search?src=typed_query&q=%23ABStorm).",
