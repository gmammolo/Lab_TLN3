  "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (WLFI) -\nTwo winter storm systems are set to impact the area over the next few days, bringing a mix of ice, snow, and freezing temperatures.\nINDOT is already gearing up for the severe weather, with plans to begin road preparations Thursday afternoon.\n\"With the fact we know there are a couple systems coming in we're getting ready for that. We've already started our anti-icing operations out on the roadway,\" said Blake Dollier, Public Relations Director for INDOT West Central.\nMore than a dozen trucks are set to treat roads ahead of the first storm surge, with additional crews ready for the second system expected to hit on Sunday\n\"With all that said we are all hands on deck,\" Dollier said.\nSeveral drivers will be on standby to respond as needed.\n\"Winter operations is on call 24/7, it doesn't matter if it's New Years Day, it doesn't matter if its a weekend or holiday, no matter what our drivers are going to be ready to go out there,\" Dollier said.\nINDOT isn't the only agency on standby during these storm systems—first responders are also getting ready. Winter weather often leads to more hazardous driving conditions, and first responders typically see an increase in calls as the snow and ice move in.\n\"Take your time when you have to travel. Leave earlier, leave some distances in between vehicles and pay attention to your surroundings,\" said Ashley Sneathen, a Lafayette Firefighter.\nThe Lafayette Fire Department has received two sets of bunker gear for each call, allowing firefighters to rotate their gear, including gloves and hoods.\n\"As far as us on the engines and the trucks, we have to be mindful of our surroundings as well especially when we're responding emergent. We have to be very careful when we're driving and approaching busy intersections,\" said Sneathen.\nSneathen advised keeping a safety kit in your car, stocked with essential items. Having these supplies on hand is crucial in case drivers find themselves stranded on the road.\nFor those staying indoors, there are also some important tips to remember as the temperatures drop.\n\"Make sure that you're keeping those space heaters at least three feet away from drapery curtains, anything that's combustible that can easily ignite, keep those areas clear from that and make sure you're not overloading extension cords,\" Sneathen said.\nDollier stressed the need to continue emphasizing safety precautions, especially given how long it's been since the area experienced a storm system with this level of potential. It's been at least two winters since a significant winter storm has passed through.\n\"This has the potential to be a lot bigger system than we've seen before. With that comes the need for extra preparations, maybe some extra meetings to discuss our plans, maybe some extra warning in advance which is what we're trying to do right here,\" Dollier said. \"Of course we don't want to worry anybody but we do want to be prepared and that's why we're putting a heavier importance on this one. Yes it might not be the first snow, but this one is certainly looking to be a bigger winter weather event.\"\nDollier also recommended using the 511 INDOT Trafficwise Map to stay informed and up to date.",
