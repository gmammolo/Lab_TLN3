  "text": "Ice blamed for multiple crashes on Kent bridge Wednesday night Jeff Saunders Ravenna Record-Courier Kent safety forces were kept busy for about 90 minutes because of crashes involving nearly a dozen vehicles on the Fairchild Avenue bridge Wednesday night.\nPolice Lt. Mike Lewis said Thursday that dispatch logs showed as many as 11 vehicles involved in crashes that began at about 6:50 p.m., with police remaining on scene until about 8:20 p.m.\nLewis said there were two requests for ambulances and seven tow trucks were called. Lewis said, however, that he did not have any information about injuries or whether anyone was transported to a hospital.\nDue to a shift change since Wednesday night, information was not available Thursday from the Kent Fire Department.\nLewis said it appears that the bridge \"iced over pretty badly,\" causing vehicles to lose control. He said a city salt truck was called to salt the bridge.\n\"We would just remind people that the bridges ice over more quickly than do the roadways and to exercise caution,\" said Lewis.\nReporter Jeff Saunders can be reached at jsaunders@recordpub.com.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
