  "text": "FOX 26 Houston Weather Forecast: Major cold on the way next week\nSpotty light rain will continue to impact parts of Houston and areas closer to the coast through the nighttime hours. Temperatures tonight will dip to the low 50s in Houston and should rebound to near 70 for Friday and Saturday. Rain chances will drop to 10% the next few days but jump up to 70% ahead of a cold front Sunday. Sunday's cold front will bring a potential round of strong to severe storms as temperatures soar close to 80 by Sunday afternoon. Timing for strong to severe storm Sunday will be from Noon to 7 p.m. with the biggest threat North of Interstate 10 and East of Interstate 45. There will be a low chance for a brief tornado, hail, strong winds and heavy rain. Strong cold front will drop through Houston Sunday night and temperatures will tumble about 25° for Monday. Keep in mind that there is a high chance for temperatures to dip below freezing multiple nights next week for Houston and surrounding areas. Take steps now to protect your pipes and sensitive plants and make sure to wear extra layers to protect your pets & yourself from the cold. Chances for any snow or ice next week are looking lower but not zero at this time. The best shot for any snowflakes would likely be between Wednesday and Friday. Keep checking back for updates on the Sunday severe storm threat and the arctic blast and any chance for wintry precipitation by downloading our FOX 26 weather app and FOX Local app for your phone and smart TV!",
