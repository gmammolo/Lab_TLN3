  "text": "By Rosanna Fraire, San Angelo Standard-Times ,\n11 hours ago Fallout from the polar vortex is expected to hit as soon as Sunday with winter temperatures in tow.\nSan Angelo and Abilene are expected to get a cold front early next week with lower temperatures in the 20s.\n\"A strong cold front will move through west central Texas Sunday bringing much colder air into the area,\" according to a Facebook post on Thursday from the National Weather Service . \"Expect above normal temperatures through Saturday before the front.\"\nAdam Wiley, NWS meteorologist, said Thursday that the cold front is expected to hit Sunday afternoon and last through Wednesday.\nTemperatures will be below normal with temperatures below freezing likely each night.\n\"That'll give us colder weather looking right now with highs in the 40s and lows in the mid-20s,\" Wiley said. \"This will potentially be the coldest temperatures we've seen so far this winter especially at night.\"\nThe NWS forecast only looks ahead for seven days. Snow is currently not in the forecast for San Angelo and Abilene.\n\"Right now in our forecast, we don't have any precipitation,\" Wiley said. \"That can obviously change between now and then, but the main thing right now is the colder temperatures. We could potentially be down into the teens next week.\"\nNWS seven day forecast Friday : Sunny, with a high near 65. Calm wind becoming east around 5 mph in the afternoon.\nFriday night : Partly cloudy with a low around 47. East wind around 5 mph becoming south after midnight.\nSaturday : Partly sunny with a high near 70. South wind 5 to 10 mph increasing to 10 to 15 mph in the afternoon. Winds could gust as high as 30 mph.\nSaturday night : Partly cloudy with a low around 49. South wind around 10 mph with gusts as high as 20 mph.\nSunday : Sunny with a high near 63. West wind 10 to 15 mph becoming north in the afternoon. Winds could gust as high as 25 mph.\nSunday night : Mostly clear with a low around 27.
