  "text": "By Frank Zufall Sawyer County Record ,\n11 hours ago\nHAYWARD — It’s not your imagination — this winter, so far, has been mostly a mirror of the 2023-24 winter: very little snow.\nAnd after weekend rains, much of the area is snowless — much like it was in 2023 at the end of the year.\nOn Jan. 3, 2024, the Sawyer County Record published the article “2023 Nov.-Dec. snow accumulation lowest in 52 years.” That article strictly focused on the months of November and December and reported the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Data for the local climate of the “Hayward area” recorded, with missing data, was just 2 inches (it was actually 2.6 inches).\nThere was snowfall in the Hayward area late October 2023, so the snow accumulation from Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2023, for the Hayward area actually was 6.1 inches.\nThe 2024 NOAA snow accumulation data for October through December for the Hayward area has so much missing data that no snow accumulation is shown.\nHowever, to the west, the Spooner Experimental Agricultural Research Station, where state employees record weather data for NOAA, the October-Dec. 28, 2024 snow accumulation is 3.7 inches (with some missing data). For that same period in 2023, 3.9 inches were recorded — almost the exact amount.\nTo the northwest, the Gordon Ranger Station NOAA snow accumulation data for October-Dec. 28, 2024, is 5.4 inches (with missing data), and for the same period in 2023, the recorded snow accumulation was 5 inches. Again, the snow accumulations for both winters are very close.\nTo the northeast, Clam Lake, which typically receives more snow than the Hayward area, is reporting 13 inches of snow accumulation for the three months in 2024, and for the same October-December period in 2023, it recorded 11.5 inches. Again, the snow accumulations for the two winter seasons are tracking very close to each other.\nBen Popp, executive director of the American Birkebeiner Ski Foundation, believes the northern half of Sawyer County received much more snow than the southern half in 2024 for October-December. He said there was enough snow to groom the Birkie Trail once from Cable to Gravel Pit (about 6 miles south of the OO Trailhead east of Seeley).\n“I think there has been somewhere between 5 to 9 inches of snow,” he said on Friday, Dec. 27, 2024, adding, “But with the rain, I think all the natural snow will be gone by Monday.”\nTaken together, all the data, so far, for the start of the 2024-25 winter seasons appears to be tracking very closely with the snow accumulation that occurred at the start of the 2023-24 winter season, which was followed by low snowfall for subsequent months, negatively impacting winter sports of snowmobiling and cross-country skiing.\nIn February, the 50th American Birkebeiner was held around the Birkie start line on a 10K loop of man-made snow surrounded by bare ground. There was no natural snow available for the race to end in Hayward.\nThe 2023-24 winter economy was severely impacted by the lack of snow, resulting in empty beds at area hotels and resorts and lack of clients for area restaurants and bars.\nTo fully appreciate how low the snowfall was for the 2023-24 season, the comparison of snow accumulation from Nov. 1 to March 31 for the five previous winter seasons, from 2018-23, reveals the 2023-24 accumulation was approximately half or less of any of the five preceding winters.\n2023-24: 23.4 inches2022-23: 85.1 inches2021-22: 61.5 inches2020-21: 39.5 inches2019-20: 57.8 inches2018-19: 58.9 inches\nBut what about those forecasts?\nOver the summer and early fall, there was a lot of talk of the upcoming winter, with above-average precipitation and below-normal temperatures and to skiers and snowmobilers, that sounds like snow … lots of snow.\nThe enthusiasm was bolstered by the prediction of a La Nina event in the Pacific Ocean with a cooling of ocean surface temperatures often resulting in the Midwest experiencing colder winters, with more snow accumulation.\nLast winter season, the area was impacted by warmer El Nino currents in the Pacific that predictably resulted in higher temps and less precipitation.\nOne could easily blame the 2023-24 sad winter on big bad El Nino, but it appears, so far, El Nino’s sister, La Nina, is not coming to turn the winter season around.\nAnd looking at long-range temperature and precipitation outlooks from NOAA isn’t offering much promise either:\n• Three to four weeks’ temperature outlook has our area in 50-60% below normal temperatures.\n• Three to four weeks precipitation outlook for our area is an equal chance for being above or below normal.\nBirkie preps?\nPopp was asked if the Birkie is already thinking alternative preparations for the 2025 event, or is it too early?\n“No, it’s not too early,” said Popp. “I mean, we are not looking necessarily at full-blown alternatives, but certainly after the first of the year, we will be starting to think if we do bring the snow guns out (for snow making) and more. We learned a lot from last year and we have a series of contingencies, everything from finishing on Duffy’s Field to focusing on the northern half between the start and OO.”\nHe added, “There are probably five or six different contingencies based on whatever Mother Nature will allow.”\nHe noted the next big event for the Birkie Tail is the Seeley Hills Classic the second week in February, about six weeks away.\nPopp noted a University of Wisconsin-River Falls economic impact study of the Birkie which shows it brings in $5 million to the area that week. He said everyone at the Birkie realizes just how important it is to have a typical Birkie, including ending the race in downtown Hayward, the classic finish of the race.\nThe Record has heard some concern from downtown Hayward businesses about ensuring the race finish downtown. The concern has arisen over whether Lake Hayward freezes sufficiently and the race ends on Duffy’s Field off Wheeler Road, far from the downtown.\nPopp said he hasn’t heard from any businesses but notes there are options for going around Lake Hayward, but it would involve at least bringing in a mile of snow for a groomed trail and it would be costly.\n“I mean, we could figure a way around Lake Hayward,” he said. “We could go down Wheeler Road to County Highway B or take Highway 77 to Duffy Road, but again, we are talking of upwards of a mile of snow. We are talking serious cash if someone wants to do that, but I think it is pretty unrealistic to think the only issue is Lake Hayward. It’s not just the lake ice. It’s the snow and a variety of issues, but I mean, we are open to all ideas. We want to get people here because when people come they support local businesses.”\nWith more events occurring at the Birkie start line outside Cable and last year’s 50th Birkie held totally up near the former Telemark property, Popp said he has heard some are saying the Birkie’s focus is entirely on the Cable area and not Hayward.\n“I tell people, ‘Are you kidding me?’” he said. “The number-one thing for skiers is to finish on Main Street and that’s our number-one goal, to finish on Main Street, but it all depends on what Mother Nature allows us to do.”\nGroomed and rolled snow\nAs noted, Popp said the Birkie Trail had been groomed once from the start line down to the Gravel Pit area and then from Gravel Pit to Wheeler Road, it had been rolled with a machine but not fully groomed.\n“I’ve actually skied on the Birkie Trail six times this year,” he said. “I skied zero times last year for the same period, so I would argue we are ahead of last year by quit a bit.”\nBut Popp also acknowledges the weekend rains would probably remove all the natural snow, leaving just 5K of man-made snow around the start line.\n1",
