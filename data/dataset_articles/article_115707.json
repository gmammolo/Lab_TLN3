  "text": "By Tiffany Chan ,\n2 hours ago\nPowerful winds send trees onto homes and cars in Massachusetts 02:11\nBILLERICA - Heavy winds brought down trees and debris across Massachusetts Thursday, including in Billerica where a giant tree fell on a home – narrowly missing the homeowner.\nTree misses homeowner by moments \"That's my house,\" John Guarino told WBZ-TV. \"Branches went inside the house, right in my bedroom.\"\nGuarino has quite the mess to clean up after a massive tree crashed into his Billerica home Thursday, missing him by just moments. He was taking a break from work in his home office to make lunch when the whole house shook.\n\"If I was still working, I wouldn't be here,\" he said. \"The house shook just a little bit but I was like halfway down the stairs when it happened.\"\nThe tree was tangled up in live wire.\nCars crushed in Bolton The winds were whipping from Billerica to Bolton, where a downed tree blocked Green Road for hours.\n\"We've had a couple of trees that have fallen on vehicles while they were in transit on the roadways,\" Bolton Police Chief Luke Hamburger said.\nWhile the two cars were crushed, Hamburger said it's a miracle nobody inside was seriously hurt. It's been a busy day for first responders chasing down trees and power lines.\nHamburger advises residents to never go near the damage – just call 911.\n\"Especially if there's any sorts of wires involved – don't bother trying to guess whether they're cable or phone or electric,\" he said. \"Just leave them be. Call 911 and notify the utility companies.\"\nWind advisories are up across the state through 10 p.m. Thursday.",
