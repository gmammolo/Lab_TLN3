  "text": "By Todd Yakoubian ,\n1 days ago A strong storm system will affect Arkansas this weekend. Thursday and Friday, we expect temperatures close to average for this time of year. Clouds increase Saturday as our next weather maker approaches. We expect showers to increase Saturday night with rain and thunderstorms likely Sunday. There’s even a low end threat for strong/severe storms over southeastern Arkansas Very cold and windy conditions will rapidly overspread the state late Sunday into Monday morning. Northern Arkansas could see a few snow flurries, but most of the wintry weather should stay north of the state. Next week, highs will be in the 30s with lows in the teens and 20s. -Todd Yakoubian.
