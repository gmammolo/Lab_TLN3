  "text": "PARK COUNTY, Colo. — US Highway 285 is closed between Grant and Fairplay due to \"blizzard-like conditions,\" the Park County Sheriff's Office said.\nThe sheriff's office said the closure runs from milemarker 183, just north of Fairplay, to milemarker 208 on the north side of Kenosha Pass.\n\"The duration of the highway's closure is indefinite, as we lack direct communication with Mother Nature,\" [the social media post reads](https://www.facebook.com/ParkCountySheriff/posts/pfbid0fyvFjsSzzadP1m7ebDwayMLD58MfMF4TpC7czMgEBDDSNKSWsU1bwFsQDhuqrWVAl?__cft__[0]=AZXQqED-PHzspz9rnDNMIl5UYIAw4VenFAWkqW-_IxWnsq8rD2q-4Dz8foRZy1GsW6WPG6fDc3nsdS9_xlaeUIeUoLOP32w-a2LAJIh9LQlNP5NKItty51aZ4A9W4dPpCiGPKplNokSh3mvVK1z6rw2RuTrz348IgYFRKRcF1JfKZfiV9KR4CXrqQQLATzKJf4I&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R).\nA winter weather advisory was in place for western Park County above 9,000 feet earlier in the day, but the advisory ended at 5 p.m. It warned about winds gusting up to 55 mph and snow accumulations up to 1 inch.\n\"Travel could be difficult due to slick roads, snow, and poor visibility over the higher passes,\" the advisory read.\nThis story will be updated once the road reopens.\nDenver7 is committed to making a difference in our community by standing up for what's right, listening, lending a helping hand and following through on promises.
