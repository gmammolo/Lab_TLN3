  "text": "Blowing Snow Advisory: Wintry Whiteout Weekend Winter’s Fury Descends on Ontario’s Far North A Blowing Snow Advisory is in effect for Fort Severn, Peawanuck and Attawapiskat with challenging conditions expected to develop starting Friday and continuing through Sunday. The advisory warns of dangerously reduced visibility, gusty winds, and accumulating snow that will make travel extremely hazardous.\nWhat to Expect: Snow, Wind, and Near-Whiteout Conditions Light snow will make its debut on Friday, accompanied by increasing northwesterly winds gusting to 60 km/h. As Friday night progresses, the weather will intensify. Wind gusts are forecasted to reach up to 80 km/h, creating areas of blowing snow and near-blizzard conditions.\nVisibility will drop to near zero at times, particularly Friday night into Saturday. Snowfall amounts of 10 to 15 cm are expected by Sunday, adding to the wintry mix. Winds will begin to ease on Sunday, but travel difficulties may persist until conditions stabilize.\nA Look at the Stats Winds : Gusting up to 80 km/h Snowfall : 10-15 cm expected Visibility : Reduced to near zero at times Barometric Pressure : Expected to drop significantly during the storm Humidity : Likely to hover at high levels due to continuous snowfall Historic temperatures for this date remind us that January doesn’t pull punches. Wasaho’s record high for January 2 is a balmy -6.5°C, while the record low chills us to the bone at -36.2°C.",
