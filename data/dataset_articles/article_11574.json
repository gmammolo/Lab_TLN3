  "text": "The unrest in Iran is affecting India, with trade and travel both hit. On Thursday (January 15),\nIran temporarily shut its airspace around Tehran, its capital, amid ongoing tensions with the United States over nationwide protests against\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. Countries like Germany have issued advisories to airlines to steer clear of the Iranian airspace. Indian flights have also been hit.\nAir India issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays as their flights were taking an alternative route. Similarly, IndiGo Airlines also released a notice citing airspace closure. The closure was announced through a Notice to Air Missions (Notam), with the space being closed until further notice.\nIran Protests Live Updates: Tehran reopens airspace; sign of ease in tension with US?\nHere is all you need to know about the situation.\nIran shuts down airspace\nIran temporarily closed its airspace in the early hours of Thursday to most incoming and outgoing flights amid escalating tensions with the US. The notice was posted by the Federal Aviation Administration. It remained in effect for approximately two hours and was lifted around 4:00 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to The Guardian.\nLive data provided by flight tracker FlightRadar showed aircraft skirting around Iranian airspace.\nAccording to Flightradar24, some flights are now making their way toward Tehran with the Notam closing Iranian airspace expired. Notam refers to an official aviation notice issued to alert pilots, airlines, and flight planners about temporary or time-critical information such as airspace closure that could affect the safety or operation of flight.\nFlights were earlier diverted to nearby Saudi Arabia and Egypt, with some diverted to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Several countries, including Germany, warned airlines to steer clear of Iranian airspace, while US carriers have long been barred from flying over the country.\nIndian airlines reroute flights\nAir India, IndiGo, and SpiceJet, among other Indian airlines, have stated that some of their international flights have been impacted after Iran shut down its airspace.\nAir India informed its passengers of potential delays over flying the region and even cancellations where rerouting is not possible. In a post on X, the airline informed, “Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled. We request passengers to check the status of their flights on our website before heading to the airport.”\nFurther expressing regret over the inconvenience caused to passengers due to this unforeseen disruption, it wrote, “Safety of our passengers and crew remains top priority.”\nIndiGo Airlines also took to X to issue a travel advisory and wrote, “Due to the sudden airspace closure by Iran, some of our international flights are impacted. Our teams are working diligently to assess the situation and support affected customers by offering the best possible alternatives.”\nTravel Advisory\n— IndiGo (@IndiGo6E)\nDue to the sudden airspace closure by Iran, some of our international flights are impacted. Our teams are working diligently to assess the situation and support affected customers by offering the best possible alternatives.\nThis development is beyond our…[January 14, 2026]\n“This development is beyond our control, and we regret the disruption it may have caused to your travel plans. If your flight is impacted, we encourage you to visit our website to explore flexible rebooking options or to claim a refund, as per your preference. We remain committed to keeping you informed and supporting you through this evolving situation. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding,\" it added.\nSpiceJet also issued a similar travel update and advised passengers to check their flight status. They also provided helpline numbers for the convenience of the passengers.\n— SpiceJet (@flyspicejet)\n[#TravelUpdate]: Due to airspace closure in Iran, some of our flights may be affected. Passengers are advised to check their flight status at[https://t.co/2wynECZugy]or contact our 24*7 Reservation Helpline numbers at +91 (0)124 4983410 or +91 (0)124 7101600 for assistance.[January 15, 2026]\nAn IndiGo flight from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Delhi was said to be the last foreign aircraft flying before Tehran suddenly closed its skies on Thursday. Live tracking data from Flightradar24 indicates that IndiGo flight 6E1808 departed Tbilisi late Wednesday morning and flew over Iran shortly after 2:30 am, before arriving in Delhi at 7:03 am on Thursday.\nIndians told to evacuate Iran\nOn January 14 (Wednesday), India urged all its nationals to leave Iran and advised against travelling to the country. The advisory was issued by the Indian embassy in Tehran.\n“In continuation of the advisory issued by the Government of India on 5 January 2025, and in view of the evolving situation in Iran, Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport, including commercial flights,” the advisory read.\nAnother advisory issued by the Ministry of External Affairs strongly advised Indians to avoid travel to Iran until further notice in view of ongoing developments. This was a reiteration of an Janaury 5 advisory, which urged Indians in Iran to exercise caution and avoid protests or demonstrations.\nThere are about 10,000 Indians in Iran, mostly students.\nTensions continue in Iran\nThe temporary closure of the airspace and the advisories come with protests entering their 21st day. What began as demonstrations over record inflation and the steep fall in Iran’s currency has now expanded into widespread anti-government unrest.\nUS Donald Trump has been warning of action in Iran over their brutal crackdown on protesters. Earlier,\nErfan Soltani, a protester who was arrested during demonstrations, was reportedly set to be executed by the authorities.\nBut Trump said on Wednesday he had been told the killings of protesters in Iran had been halted, but added that he would “watch it and see” about threatened military action.\nExperts consider the ongoing protests and their fallout to be the biggest challenge to Iran’s clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nWith inputs from agencies\nFollow Firstpost on Google.
