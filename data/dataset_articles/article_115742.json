  "text": "New year, same cold temperatures!\nCalgary managed to reach a high of -15 C on Thursday, which is considerably cooler than the normal high of -3 C for this time of year. But the city is not cold enough to qualify for an Extreme Cold Warning, which is the case for some areas in central and northern Alberta.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada issues these warnings when wind chill values are close to -40 C for several hours.\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips",
