  "text": "By Susan Szuch, Springfield News-Leader ,\n7 hours ago After a relatively mild Christmas and New Year, Springfield is expected to start 2025 off with some frigid temperatures, according to the National Weather Service .\nA weather briefing from the NWS Springfield office says the area will probably see temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below the average temperatures for this time of year.\nThe average high for this time of year is 40 degrees to 45 degrees, according to the NWS, whereas the average low is generally 22 degrees to 25 degrees.\nWeather is expected to be mostly dry through Saturday morning, according to the forecast, with winter storms possible Saturday afternoon through Monday. A Facebook post from the NWS in Springfield indicates that the Springfield, Bolivar, Lebanon and Ava areas could get a mix of rain, freezing rain, sleet and snow, while the far southwest corner of Missouri is more likely to get rain and freezing rain.\nSub-zero wind chills may also be possible heading into next week for Ozarks-area communities. In Springfield on Monday night, the wind chill could make it feel like it's zero degrees to 5 degrees out, and like it's zero degrees on Tuesday night.\nTo stay safe when wind chills are that severe, the NWS says folks should stay indoors if possible, bring pets indoors, and keep flammable items at least 3 feet away from space heaters. If people must go outside, they should cover all exposed skin.\nStaying safe in severe cold Severe cold weather, especially when accompanied by wind chills, can affect the body's blood circulation, cardiovascular system and airways, according to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department.\nHere are some things people should do to stay safe when temperatures drop:\nStay indoors if possible. If your home does not have heat or you do not have access to shelter, consider visiting a building open to the public like a shopping mall, public library, church or community building. Drink more fluids — regardless of your activity level — and avoid drinks with caffeine or alcohol, since they affect how your body reacts to the cold. Dress in layers, which will help keep you warmer than a single heavy layer. Minimize sitting or squatting in the cold for prolonged periods of time, since it can hinder circulation. Stretch and do a few exercises before going outside to work to avoid muscle strain and be mindful of your exertion, as extreme cold puts extra strain on the heart for everyone. Use the buddy system: Monitor the condition of people you’re with and have someone do the same for you. Carry extra clothes with you such as socks, gloves, hats and jacket so you can change them if you get wet.

Jefferson Ave., by 5:30 p.m., according to Community Partnership of the Ozarks. At the Veterans Coming Home Center, they can receive a hot meal and sign up for an open shelter. Buses will transport people to shelters at 6:30 p.m.\nFor more information on crisis cold weather shelters in Springfield, to apply to be an additional shelter or to volunteer, go to cpozarks.org/programs/ccws .\nThis article originally appeared on Springfield News-Leader: Springfield could see winter storm with freezing rain, snow, dangerous cold",
