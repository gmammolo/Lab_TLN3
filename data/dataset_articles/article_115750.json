  "text": "First Alert: We’re monitoring a severe threat & a COLD blast\nMERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) -\nWe’re going to have a couple of cold fronts cross our area over the next few days. The 1st one will cross on Friday, and it’ll be a dry front. This means that it won’t bring us any rain, but it will bring another dose of colder air. So, we’ll go from experiencing highs on Friday near 60 degrees to experiencing lows Saturday morning in the upper 20s...burr! Highs on Saturday will struggle to reach the mid 50s, but Saturday night into Sunday AM won’t be terribly cold thanks to a southerly wind that returns. We’ll start Sunday with low 40s, and highs will land in the mid 60s. Yet, this warm up will take place ahead of the next cold front that’ll impact our area... which will be more potent.\nFIRST ALERT- SEVERE RISK\nThe 2nd cold front will cross our area Sunday night, but showers & storms will erupt ahead of it. We’ll start our Sunday with scattered light showers (non-severe), then there will be a bit of a lull during the early afternoon. During that time, it’ll heat up into the 60s, and the atmosphere will become more supportive for possible threatening weather. The main line of storms will cross our area some time between 6PM - 2AM, and there’s the possibility for some storms to reach severe limits. For now, the risk is low, but it is still a risk. Damaging wind will be the main threat as this system will have a lot of wind energy. Even away from storms, wind gusts over 30 MPH will be possible. Yet, a tornado can’t be ruled out. So, it’s very important that you have multiple ways of getting severe alerts Sunday evening. Stay tuned to our First Alert Weather Team for updates.\nFIRST ALERT- COLD\nBehind Sunday’s storms, the coldest air of the season (thus far) will filter into our area. All of next week, highs will only reach the 40s which is WELL below the average. Morning lows will start in the upper 30s Monday (1/6), but 20s can be expected for mornings the rest of the week. This type of freeze is significant, so make sure to plan ahead and prepare to follow cold weather safety: [https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold](https://www.weather.gov/safety/cold)\nFIRST ALERT-WINTRY WEATHER POTENTIAL\nFor January 9-10, some forecast models are hinting at an area of low pressure moving across the northern Gulf....swinging moisture our way. As mentioned, we’re going to be in an unseasonably cold environment during that time-frame. So, if moisture does find its way towards us... wintry weather would be probable. Yet, the confidence is currently low for this to happen because there is not good forecast model agreement amongst the various forecast models we monitor. This forecast will be tricky, so stay tuned to our First Alert Weather Team as we continuously monitor the trends.\n[Click here](https://www.wtok.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our daily newsletter!\nCopyright 2025 WTOK.
