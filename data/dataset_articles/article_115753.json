(KSNB) - Mother Nature has sent us a reminder the first few days of the new year that is winter with seasonally cold temperatures returning. She’s not done yet as she will send a weekend winter storm that will wreak havoc on a large portion of the area. This will be definitely be one to keep an eye on. Be sure to stay up to date with the latest weather updates by downloading the Local4 weather app.\nThis evening and overnight, more clouds along with areas of fog possible. The fog potential looks looks best for areas west of Highway 183. By tomorrow morning, temperatures will fall back into the 10s and lower 20s, so areas of freezing fog will be possible. Friday will be a rather cloudy day and most locations won’t see any sun. The best chance of seeing some sun will be Southwest Nebraska. Late in the day and into Friday night, some light snow accumulation will be possible near and north of Highway 2 in western and central parts of Nebraska. Low temperatures by Saturday morning will be colder, down into the 10s, but some may drop into the upper single digits up north.\nOver the weekend, we’ll see a winter storm system bring the best chance for widespread snow that we have seen so far this winter season. Most will see some sort of impacts, but the greatest impacts look to be in south central and southeast Nebraska into central and eastern Kansas. Saturday will be an even colder day with a lot of clouds around. It will be breezy making it feel much colder. As the day goes on, we’ll see developing moisture. Initially, there may be a wintry mix including sleet and some light freezing rain over Southern Nebraska and Northern Kansas, while the rest of the area sees developing snow. Later in the day and into Saturday night, most of the areas with freezing rain will see a conversion to snow. The snow will become more widespread and pick up in intensity as we go through Saturday night. Most of the area will deal with travel difficulties due to snow (and/or Ice), but the current path of this system would set up Southeast Nebraska into North Central/Northeast Kansas with the greatest impacts. Not only will ice cause issues early on, but these areas may end up getting the highest snow totals. It’s still a bit early for exact details on how much snow will fall, but there is a possibility that southeastern areas pick up 6 inches or more of snowfall. Forecast models have trended upward this afternoon indicating the potential for a foot of snow in southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas. Most other locations will pick up at least a little snow accumulation, which will still cause issues. Winds will be breezy with this system, but not super windy. So some minor blowing snow is a possibility. Snow will continue into The daytime Sunday, tapering off as we head through the afternoon into early evening. Meanwhile, arctic air continues to spill south. Saturday’s highs will range from the mid 10s north to the mid 20s south. Sunday’s highs will range from the upper 0s north to the lower 20s out west.\nQuieter weather is expected for the first half of next week. It’ll remain quite cold early in the week, but there will be a little bit of a warming trend by the middle of the week. There is some hope that milder temperatures could return later in the week by next weekend.\n[Click here](https://www.ksnblocal4.com/newsletter/) to subscribe to our KSNB Local4 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KSNB.
