  "text": "Next Article\nHDFC Infinia credit card rewards take a hit—here's what's changing\nBusiness\nStarting January 16, 2026, HDFC Bank is cutting reward points on its Infinia credit card.\nThe SmartBuy multiplier drops from 5X to 3X, so you'll now earn 15 points per ₹150 spent on SmartBuy (down from 25).\nThat's about a 40% drop in value, though regular spends still get the usual five points per ₹150.\nWhat else to know?\nThis isn't just an HDFC thing—ICICI recently cut back perks too, and lounge access rules are getting stricter.\nIf you're chasing rewards or freebies, it might be time to rethink your strategy.",
