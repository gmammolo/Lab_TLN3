  "text": "A Status Yellow low temperature and ice warning is in effect for the entire country until 11am.\nIt marks the start of an extended cold snap and a significant change in the weather compared to the relatively mild Christmas period.\nMet Éireann said there will be widespread frost and ice and also warned of potential hazardous travelling conditions and animal welfare issues.\nTemperatures could plummet at the weekend and next week, with Met Éireann warning of the possibility of significant snowfall as an Arctic air mass is set to bring bitterly cold conditions.\nThe forecaster said the cold snap is set to continue to the end of next week.\nTemperatures are forecast to fall significantly below freezing in the early part of next week, with overnight temperatures as low as -10C in places on Tuesday night.\nThe National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) said it is liaising with Met Éireann regarding the possibility of disruptive weather over the weekend.\nIt is monitoring the situation closely.\nMet Éireann forecaster Matthew Martin said that the coldest areas will be across the south midlands.\nSpeaking on RTÉ News at One yesterday, he said that there is a cold polar northerly air flow covering the country that will remain over the weekend and into next week.\nMr Martin added that the chance for hazardous winter weather increases over the weekend and on Saturday, a band of rain is going to push in from the Atlantic Ocean and track northwards over the country.\nAs this rain interacts with the cold air, it will turn to snow in some areas, he said, adding that there was a lot of uncertainty as to where the rain to snow boundary will be positioned.\nA similar warning has been issued by the UK Met Office for counties Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down and Tyrone. The alert is in effect until 10am.\nThe UK Met Office said that icy patches on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths can be expected.\nThe NDFEM, the body which coordinates emergency responses and gives support to the Irish Fire Service, issued a statement in advance of the cold snap.\n\"The National Directorate for Fire & Emergency Management is liaising with Met Éireann regarding the possibility of disruptive weather over the weekend,\" it said.",
