  "text": "NORTH TEXAS – It has been a beautiful start to 2025 with temperatures near average across North Texas. The trend will continue into the weekend. However, an Arctic front will cause temperatures to plummet on Sunday. Some of the coldest air of the season will settle across the region on Monday. Hence, a First Alert has been issued for both days.\nMorning lows starting Monday through the rest of the week will be freezing, quite literally. Now is the time to winterize your home and make a plan to bring plants and pets indoors.\nThe main concern for North Texas is the significant temperature dip. However, there is also a chance of rainfall for Sunday east of the I-35 corridor.\nThe American model, known as the GFS, is showing drizzle and showers on Saturday with another round of rain on Sunday morning. Conditions clear by the evening with winds shifting from the southwest to northwest, gusting up to 35 mph.\nThe European model is also showing the front moving through in the morning on Sunday, providing the region with showers and storms. However, no precipitation is shown for Saturday.\nThe models are not yet in full consensus, but what we do know is that spotty showers and storms will likely occur Sunday morning along and east of I-35, clearing by the evening. As for the next week, be sure to bundle up and stay First Alert!\nMore from CBS News Beautiful, clear end to the week in North Texas before Arctic air arrives New Year's Day chilly, full of sunshine across North Texas Cold temperatures return to usher North Texas into the New Year Beyond the Bar co-founder embraces Dry January, sees health benefits Here's where you can watch fireworks in North Texas on New Year's Eve In: Weather Forecast First Alert Weather North Texas Dallas Fort Worth",
