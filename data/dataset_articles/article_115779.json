The IMD forecasts 18 degrees Celsius temperatures, but fog is causing major traffic disruptions. Over Rs 112 crore in fines collected since 2015.\nNew Delhi: With minimum temperatures plunging to a mere 7 degrees Celsius and a thick layer of fog covering the entire National Capital Region (NCR), Delhi is yet again witnessing an AQI of 348, per the central government’s Sameer App. Notably, other cities in the region including Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, and Faridabad are also not far behind with AQI readings clocked at 253, 291, 285, 252, and 214 respectively.\nHowever, it is also worth mentioning that, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) weekly forecast, the maximum temperature in the capital city will hover around 18 degrees Celsius as the day progresses. With visuals from parts of NCR showing a thick blanket of fog and AQI at ‘very poor’ or ‘poor’ levels, traffic disruptions are anticipated in the region .\nWATCH: Fog engulfs parts of Delhi-NCR\nVisuals from Akshardham:\n[#WATCH]| Delhi: Dense fog engulfs the national capital as cold wave grips the city.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) clarified that environmental compensation (EC) is a policy tool grounded in the “polluter pays” principle, aimed at safeguarding the environment. Under this framework, fines are levied on those who breach environmental laws, and the funds collected are allocated for restoration efforts. The green body had sought details from the DPCC regarding the EC charges and their utilisation.\nAs per a PTI report, the committee said, “DPCC has received Rs 11,208.15 lakh (Rs 112.08 crore) as EC fund from April 2015 till November 20 (2024), and Rs 3,605.66 lakh (Rs 36.05 crore) has been utilised so far.”\nClick for more latest [Delhi news](https://www.news9live.com/city/delhi).
