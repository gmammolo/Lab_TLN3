  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nAlhajj Maulana Noor Muhammad Bin Salih, Ameer and Missionary-in-Charge of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, Ghana, has described corruption as a disease that has drained the nation’s economic vitality and weakened public trust in governance.\nThe growing mistrust between citizens and the State, he noted, had eroded national commitment and the spirit of collective sacrifice needed for development.\nAlhajj Bin Salih was speaking at the 93rd Jalsa Salana Ghana 2026, the Annual National Convention of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Mission, held at Pomadze in the Central Region.\nThe convention, on the theme: “Moral Decadence and Our Responsibilities,” sought to provide participants with spiritual renewal, deepen religious understanding and strengthen bonds of brotherhood within the community.\nHe called on the nation to turn sincerely to the Creator, stressing that national transformation required genuine humility, repentance and moral discipline, rather than mere verbal expressions of faith.\nAlhajj Bin Salih said the restoration of moral life must begin with individuals, extend to families and communities, anchored in trust in Allah, who supports truth, justice and righteousness.\nHe noted that moral decadence was not inevitable, explaining that Islam teaches that societies could be rejuvenated through justice, integrity and sincere return to God.\nAt the level of State leadership, justice, accountability, transparency and compassion must remain the foundation of national stability, while communities and religious institutions should serve as centres of moral guidance and social support, particularly for the youth, he said.\n“Individuals are called to renew their spiritual lives through prayer, engagement with the Holy Qur’an and God-consciousness,” he added, stressing that addressing moral decline was a shared responsibility.\nThe 93rd Jalsa Salana Ghana ended with a total attendance of 35,243 participants, comprising 18,690 females and 16,553 males.",
