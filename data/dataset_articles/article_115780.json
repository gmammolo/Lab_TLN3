  "text": "Over 200 flight services were delayed at Delhi airport and dozens of trains were affected across North India on Friday morning as a thick layer of fog shrouded many states amid an extreme cold wave. According to flight monitoring website Flightradar, at least 72 departing flights have been delayed, and six have been cancelled at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. The arrival of 215 flights has been delayed, while 10 have been cancelled. At Kolkata airport, 17 departing flights were delayed, one was cancelled, and 36 arriving flights were also delayed.The runway visibility was zero at Delhi Airport on Friday morning, and airport authorities warned of potential disruptions to flight operations. IndiGo and Spicejet also cautioned against weather delays.At least 24 trains, including several long-distance services, are running late due to the foggy conditions, the Railways said. Some of these trains are delayed by up to 4.5 hours. The affected services include Karnaraka and Bihar Sampark Kranti Expresses, Bhatinda-Balurghat Farakka Express, Andhra Pradesh Express, Ayodhya Express among others. Due to reduced visibility from fog, a private bus and a truck collided in Punjab's Bathinda, causing injuries to 20 to 25 passengers.In the National Capital Region (NCR), this marked the fifth consecutive day of a cold wave, with the city experiencing a significant drop in maximum temperature. The India Meteorological Department has issued an orange warning for Delhi, anticipating \"dense to very dense fog\" and has also predicted a partly cloudy sky on Friday. In Noida, the district authorities announced that schools will remain closed for classes till 8 until further orders. The weather department has predicted a low of 8 degrees Celsius for Noida on Friday. States including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are also experiencing a severe cold wave accompanied by thick fog.As the mercury plummeted across several parts of Bihar, including the state capital Patna, the minimum temperatures are expected to remain between 6-11 degrees Celsius over the next three to four days. In response, the government has ordered changes in school timings. All schools will operate from 9 am to 4 pm until January 6. In Rajasthan's Fatehpur, located in the Sikar district, the lowest temperature recorded in the past 24 hours was 3.6 degrees Celsius.Published By: Ajmal Published On: Jan 3, 2025Must Watch",
