  "text": "By Joe Fitzwater ,\n6 hours ago\nAlerts Issued for Our Region Winter Storm Warning from 4 AM Friday to Saturday morning for southeastern Fayette, Nicholas, western Greenbrier and northwestern Pocahontas counties. Travel is expected to be very difficult with several inches of snow expected, along with wind gusts up to 45 mph. Winter Weather Advisory from Friday morning to Saturday morning for Wyoming, Raleigh, Summers, Mercer and northwestern Fayette counties. Light snowfall accumulations and gusty winds will make for tricky travel Friday during the morning commute. Tonight features increasing clouds as our next system approaches. We’ve got a cold and blustery night on the way as temperatures drop back into the mid 20s and wind gusts occasionally rise above 30 mph, putting wind chill values down into the single digits at times – that will enable frostbite to occur in less than thirty minutes! Snow showers will approach by dawn.\nFriday provides more snow, as a clipper system rolls through the region. Snow showers will be accompanied by gusty winds that will occasionally reach above 25 mph, once again putting wind chill values back into the teens at times as high temperatures struggle to reach 30 degrees.\nAs with most clipper systems, snow accumulation will be relatively minor, but with this system moving through during the morning hours, slick spots will be expected on the roads. For most lowland spots, around an inch of new snow can be expected and up to a couple of inches on the hilltops, with a few inches expected in the high country. Many school systems that are back in session on Friday will likely be dealing with delays Friday due to the timing of the system. This system will already be gone by dinnertime, but the cold air this system will drag down into the region will be here for the weekend. Upslope snow showers continue during the evening and overnight hours, adding to accumulations over the high-country. When all is said and done from this system, the highest peaks above 4,000 ft. such as at Snowshoe will see 6 to 8 new inches of white powder from Mother Nature.\nSaturday is a very cold but dry day, with plenty of sunshine by the afternoon expected after a morning flurry or two over the mountains with lingering upslope. High temperatures only reach the low 20s with a brutally cold air mass in place. Overnight lows will be deep down into the teens – don’t forget about your pipes with this cold pattern in place, especially if you know of any exposed piping that could make freezing even easier.\nSunday begins quiet, but by the afternoon, a wintry mix will be forthcoming to the area as a southern low pressure system scoots into the region. Temperatures during the afternoon will be in the mid to upper 20s and so we begin as snow. However, a southerly breeze out ahead of our powerful system in accompaniment with down sloping (also known as the “warm wedge”) will nudge temperatures up as we head into the evening and overnight hours, allowing snow to switch to freezing rain and eventually even into a cold rain Monday morning.\nColder air to our north will allow for snow to stick longer in those spots, with less snow and more freezing rain/rain south. The highest snow totals will remain north of our region up toward Morgantown and the US-50 corridor in north central WV/southern PA and north-central OH. However, ice accretions with a few hours of freezing rain on the order of a tenth to two tenths of an inch will cause slick travel and the potential for a few scattered power outages. This will not be a crippling ice storm that your grandparents talk about, but it will create slick roads and again, could cause a few power outages. Travel will likely be impacted Sunday afternoon, Sunday night and into the morning hours on Monday. By dawn Monday, temperatures will be hovering near to just above freezing.\nMonday sees our low pressure system move off to the east, which will allow colder air to nose back into the region and wrap-around snow to take place during the afternoon after a morning that features a cold rain for most. Light snow accumulations will be expected late in the day as temperatures drop during the afternoon. Slick travel will continue to be a concern, though snowfall accumulations by Monday afternoon into the evening hours will be minor outside of the ski resorts/high-country, where a few extra inches of snow are expected. Between Sunday afternoon and Monday evening, much of our region will go from snow initially to freezing rain to a cold rain and then back to snow as colder air works its way back in. This mixed bag of wintry weather will create slick roads in our region – plan accordingly!\nWinter Weather Awareness Week: Watches, Warnings and Advisories Tuesday is a mostly cloudy and brutally cold day on the way with occasional snow showers and high temperatures struggling to reach 20 degrees. With a sharp westerly breeze, wind chill values will be in the single digits at times even into the afternoon.\nWednesday sees the sunshine return with high pressure nosing into the region but the exceptionally cold pattern continues, with high temperatures once again struggling to reach the 20s and overnight lows being stuck in the single digits and low teens. A few lingering flurries still can’t be ruled out over the high-country.\nThursday provides plenty of sunshine but it’s a brutally cold day on the way, with highs only in the teens.\nLooking ahead in your extended forecast, a Canadian high pressure system allows for some very cold air to spill into the eastern US. Does this mean more snow? Not necessarily, but the first ingredient you need for snow is cold air, and we will have plenty of it during the mid-month of January. High temperatures will likely be held down into the 20s for several days! This overall cold pattern will continue through the first three weeks of January. We do look much warmer for February.\nTONIGHT\nIncreasing clouds. Cold and blustery with lows in the mid 20s.\nFRIDAY\nSnow showers likely. Blustery. Slick travel early. Highs near freezing.\nSATURDAY\nEarly flurries. Partly cloudy. Very cold! Highs in the low 20s.\nSUNDAY\nAfternoon snow to a wintry mix overnight as temperatures slowly climb. Highs near freezing.\nMONDAY\nCold rain to snow showers likely. Highs near freezing.\nTUESDAY\nLingering snow showers. Cold! Highs in the low 20s.\nWEDNESDAY\nMostly sunny. Highs around 20.\nTHURSDAY\nMostly sunny. Highs in the low 20s.\nFRIDAY\nIsolated snow showers. Highs in the mid 20s.\nSATURDAY\nIsolated snow showers. Highs in the mid 20s.\nSUNDAY\nPartly sunny. Highs in the mid 20s.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
