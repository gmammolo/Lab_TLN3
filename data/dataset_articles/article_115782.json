  "text": "by Riley Fannon\nFri, January 3rd 2025 at 6:45 PM 7 VIEW ALL PHOTOS All of Mid-Missouri is under a Winter Storm Watch from 6pm Saturday to 3am Monday. (KRCG 13) TOPICS:\nWinter Storm Mid-Missouri Freezing Rain Snow Accumulation Ice Accumulations Travel Hazards Interstate 70 Weather Alerts Winter weather alerts stretch from Kansas to Pennsylvania ahead of a major winter storm this weekend and Mid-Missouri could face significant impacts. Freezing rain, sleet and snow all look possible with this storm, and they could make travel hazardous beginning Saturday night through Sunday. As of Thursday evening, the energy associated with this storm was still over the Pacific Ocean so changes to the path of the storm and ice and snow accumulations can still occur.\nThat said, all signs continue to point to this as a highly impactful storm.\nCold air ahead of the storm will mean accumulation will not be hindered for Mid-Missouri.\nThe preliminary forecasts for the region indicate areas along and north of Interstate 70 seeing lower ice totals with higher snow totals. Areas south of Interstate 70 to the Lake of the Ozarks could see more significant ice accumulations with lower snowfall totals.\nFrom the border with Iowa to the Interstate 70 corridor, up to a foot of snow looks possible with some isolated amounts over a foot not out of the question, especially as you get closer to the border with Iowa. As you get closer to the Interstate uncertainty increases as the likelihood of seeing freezing rain and then snow will be more common. South of the Interstate to the lake there is a much greater concern for an extended period of freezing rain and sleet before a change to snow. This could lead to areas south of the Interstate receiving a quarter of an inch to half of an inch or more of ice before the snow starts to fall. The timing of the storm looks to begin late Saturday afternoon/early Saturday evening from west to east. Travel late Saturday night throughout Sunday will be impacted and you'll be encouraged to avoid travel unless necessary. By Sunday evening, all areas of Mid-Missouri look to have made the transition to all snow but strong wind gusts could create blowing snow and ground blizzard conditions. Areas affected the hardest by the ice accumulation could see elevated power outage concerns as the strong winds move in. Your KRCG 13 Weather Authority team will be tracking this storm and will continue to update you on air and online throughout this event so stay tuned in for the latest information.\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2025 Sinclair, Inc.
