  "text": "aespa's Giselle and [RIIZE's Wonbin](https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/318212/20240314/dating-rumors-riize-wonbin-aespa-ningning.htm) were first caught in a dating rumor in July 2024 after former trainee Han Seo Hee, notorious for exposing the industry's secrets, released a photo of the two idols together.\nIn the picture, the back of a man and a woman, said to be in their early 20s, were spotted strolling the streets late at night. Although it was hard to confirm their identity, Han made a controversial claim about it.\n\"Wonbin started dating aespa Giselle when they were a trainee, for her money. I have the photo captured by an anti,\" she wrote, as per a report from a [media outlet](https://www.koreaboo.com/news/riize-wonbin-aespa-giselle-han-seo-hee-dating-rumor-reaction/).\nREAD ALSO: [aespa Giselle & RIIZE Wonbin's Dating Rumors Fueled By Controversial Ex-Trainee Han Seo Hee's Photo + MYs, BRIIZEs Refute Claims](https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/320762/20240723/aespa-giselle-riize-wonbin.htm)\nAt the time, MYs (aespa's fans) and BRIIZEs (RIIZE's fans) dismissed the rumor and called it groundless given Han Seo Hee's infamy.\nHowever, six months later, Giselle and Wonbin were once again speculated to be in a relationship due to their individual messages. In particular, in their recent texts, both idols replaced the word 알게찌 (allgetji) with 알겠찌 (allgejji), which is the cute version of the slang phrase, \"(You) got it?\"\nThese are not formal wordings in South Korea and are barely used as it is considered incorrect.\nIn addition to this, Wonbin and Giselle also put the \"ung\" sound at most of the end of their sentences to make it cuter, but fans raised their suspicions as this is also uncommon to use in South Korea as it has no certain meaning.\nThis time, K-Netizens are now considering that the dating rumor could be true. They expressed their sentiments through the online forum, [Nate Pann](https://m.pann.nate.com/talk/373740881).\n\"It's my first time seeing that kind of speech,\" one commenter said.\n\"When I'm next to someone I like, I start to resemble them in the way they talk. It's similar to that,\" agreed the user.\n\"I don't really believe in things like this, but this one seems really interesting,\" another fan wrote.\n\"Honestly, who would speak like that? I would understand if they are dating, but don't show it to your fans, these idols,\" criticized a netizen.\nRELATED ARTICLE: [aespa Giselle and TREASURE Jihoon Embroiled in Dating Rumors — Find Out Why](https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/317172/20240120/aespa-giselle-treasure-jihoon-embroiled-dating-rumors-find-out-why.htm)",
