  "text": "ST. LOUIS — \"We don't know specifically what's going to hit and when it's going to hit, we just know it is going to hit,\" said a frowning David Wrone with the St. Louis County Department of Transportation and Public Works. \"Worst case scenario, freezing rain, snow, combination of both, for an extended period of time.\"\nThe best case scenario for plow and salt operators is straight snow, but that's not looking like it will be the case Sunday.\nLike Wrone, IDOT's Operation Engineer Joe Monroe is sweating the forecast: \"We're just praying it's not freezing rain across the entire district. That's an awful lot of freezing rain that would cause a lot of ancillary issues, besides just roadway problems.\"\nThere's no final decision when it comes to where to position crews for winter weather. Monroe said IDOT is going to wait till late tomorrow to pick staging positions. During the storm, both IDOT and St. Louis County Crews will move to where the need is greatest.\n\"Let's hope for the best here,\" chimed in Ben Lynch, Ameren Missouri's Director of Distribution Operating. \"Depending on how severe it is we are looking to add additional resources.\"\nHeavy snow and ice can weaken power lines, sometimes downing them or causing significant drooping. Lynch said to call Ameren and never to approach or touch lines.\nJust like IDOT, St. Louis County and Ameren Missouri, Missouri American Water is planning where to stage crews in anticipation of winter weather issues.\n\"It's really just all about having our crews on standby,\" Christie Barnhart with Missouri American Water said, \"having all of our all of our equipment ready to go at a moment's notice, having all of our materials that we would need for main break repairs.\"\nWhen it comes to your pipes at home, anything from the water meter to your home is your responsibility. To avoid burst pipes, Barnhart recommended, \"If you have walls that are facing the north, keep those cabinet doors open so the warm air can hit the pipes.\"\nShe said it's important to know where the shutoff valve is so you can turn off the water in the event of a broken pipe, \"and this applies to people that rent not not just homeowners, but anyone that's in a residence where they have water service, things they can do where they're not looking at a situation where they have an accelerated water bill due to pipes, busting, or expensive home repairs.\"\nIt's also important to not check the physical meter, Barnhart said.\n\"The first thing they'll do they'll do is go out and check their meter, and that's really dangerous when it's cold, because the water meters in the ground and insulated,\" Barnhart said. \"If they pop that lid, which they shouldn't mess with the meter because that's company property, but then you're exposing that meter to that cold air which can cause the meter to bust, and that just compounds the problem.\"",
