  "text": "ATM usage fell by almost 4pc last year, says Bank of Ireland\nBank of Ireland says withdrawals from its ATMs fell by 3.7pc last year, and cash now accounts for just 13pc of monthly spending.\nThis represents a steep drop from pre-pandemic levels, when cash regularly made up around 30pc of monthly spending, and marks the fifth consecutive year of decline in cash usage.\nWhile Irish households shift increasingly towards digital payments, Bank of Ireland insists that investment in ATM infrastructure remains necessary to ensure nationwide access to cash. This is particularly important for customers who continue to depend on physical banking services and those who cannot check their bank balance online.\n“While there is a decline in the use of cash, there is still clearly a strong requirement for quality ATM services across the country and our investment allows us to provide the most modern and efficient machines,” the bank said.\nBank of Ireland said the upgrade of its ATM network is focused on improving service quality, and that newer machines are more reliable, more accessible and more energy efficient than those they are replacing.\nTotal card spending rose by 5.3pc over 2025, according to Bank of Ireland’s figures, with spending in December alone increasing by 5.7pc year-on-year, reflecting strong consumer confidence.\nSpending on electrical goods rose by 6.3pc compared with December 2024, while spending on services increased by 5.7pc.\nThe amount of money spent in restaurants and pubs rose by 2.5pc, and retail spending was up 1pc year-on-year last month. Entertainment spending increased by 2.8pc, while some of the strongest annual increases were seen in essential services, such as education, which was up 10.5pc, and health, up 9.5pc over the course of the year.\n“Consumers came out spending over Christmas across most major categories,” said Bank of Ireland chief economist Conall MacCoille.\n“These spending figures are strong and in line with expectations, with Q3 2025 national accounts showing that annual consumer spending grew robustly in the first nine months of the year, up 2.9pc on average. This is consistent with other indicators such as the 5.1pc rise in Vat receipts in 2025 and a rise of about 5pc in earnings to Q3.\n“While inflation ticked up towards late 2025, it’s likely to average around 2.2pc for the year, and this card spending data reflects that real consumer spending rose by close to 3pc in 2025 – in line with our forecasts.”\nDespite the global uncertainty over trade policy last year, due to US president Donald Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs, several indices have shown that Irish consumer sentiment remained robust throughout the year.",
