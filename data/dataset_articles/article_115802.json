  "text": "The national capital saw dense fog on Friday morning, with the minimum temperature in the city recorded at 7 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. The IMD on Wednesday also forecast an active western disturbance starting today, which is expected to raise temperatures in eastern, central, and northern India over the next 3-5 days. However, the western Himalayan region is likely to experience heavy rain and snowfall due to the disturbance. We are forecasting a western disturbance that may become active from tomorrow. Along with this, there is a possibility of another western disturbance. Temperatures may rise in east, central, and north India in the next 3-5 days, IMD scientist Soma Sen Roy said.On Wednesday, the national capital experienced a significant dip in temperatures, as the mercury in many regions has plummeted significantly as the cold weather prevails at the start of the new year.According to the India Meteorological Department, the minimum temperature at Delhi's Palam has dipped further to 6.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday from 7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.Flight operations impacted:Additionally, a thick layer of fog has enveloped the national capital as well as swept through several major cities across the nation.Airlines inlcuding IndiGo and Air India released advisories for the passengers in light of dense fog. Due to significantly low visibility in Srinagar and Chandigarh, there have been changes to flight schedules. We recommend customers to recheck their flight status before travelling to the airport http://bit.ly/3ZWAQXd. Wishing for clearer skies! said IndiGo in its advisory. Poor visibility in Delhi and parts of Northern India may affect some of our flights, said Air India.",
