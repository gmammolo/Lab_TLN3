  "text": "Below average temperatures continue\nHighs in the teens this weekend and next week\nROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) – Cold and quiet conditions will dominate the upper Midwest over the first half of January. Highs will stay in the middle teens with little to no snow chances.\nTemperatures Friday morning will be in the middle single digits with wind chills falling below zero. Wind chills could range from -3° to -10°.\nDaytime wind chills over the next 5 days will be in the low single digits if not below zero degrees at times. Highs through next Tuesday will stay in the low teens.\nThe below-average temperatures will stay in the upper Midwest through late next week. Highs might finally warm back into the low 20s by January 11th and 12th. You’ll notice dry conditions over the next 10 days are in the forecast. There could be a minor snow chance by the second weekend of January, but right now I’ve left that out of the forecast. This all means our snow deficit will continue to increase during the first half of January.\nThe seasonal snowfall deficit is at -11.2″. If we stay dry over the next 10 days, the snowfall deficit will grow to around -15″.\nNick\nFind stories like this and more, [in our apps](https://www.kttc.com/page/kttc-apps-for-ios-and-android-devices/).\nCopyright 2025 KTTC.
