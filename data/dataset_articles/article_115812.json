  "text": "MICHIGAN, USA — Old Man Winter is here to stay to kick off January, with consistent cold temperatures and periodic opportunities of snow.\nFriday’s forecast revolves around a flare-up of lake-effect snow, which will bring some impact around West Michigan. As a result, a [13 Weather Impact Alert](http://www.wzzm.com/weather) has been issued for the expectation of localized snow accumulation and resultant varying travel impacts.\nFRIDAY\nLake-effect snow will pick up throughout the early hours of Friday, with tricky travel expected for the morning commute in spots. Lake-effect will be commonplace throughout the entirety of Friday, before gradually waning in coverage and intensity Friday night into Saturday morning.\nSnowfall of 1-4\" is expected near and westward of US-131 by the end of Friday, but the strongest bands of lake-effect may produce locally higher amounts. The greatest potential for localized higher amounts will be the snowbelts off a northwest wind, which includes portions of Ottawa, Allegan, western Barry, and northern Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties. Another sweet spot for localized higher amounts is near US-10, primarily Mason, Lake, and northern Oceana and Newaygo counties.\nThose outside the steadiest lake-effect bands will likely remain on the lower end of the snowfall range. This includes a fair chunk of Kent Co., which isn't a favorable spot for consistent lake-effect snow bands off a northwest wind. Further east of US-131, across Montcalm and Ionia counties, less than 1\" of snow is expected.\nImpacts will be mostly confined to varying travel conditions, with quick reductions of visibility expected in the heaviest snow bands. Temperatures remaining in the 20s Friday will cause untreated roads to become slick and snow-covered. As always, this time of year, extra time and distance is the best course of action on the roads.\nA Winter Weather Advisory will be in effect from 4 a.m. until 7 p.m. Friday from the National Weather Service for much of West Michigan.\nWEEKEND & NEXT WEEK\nLake-effect snow will linger into the start of the weekend, but impacts will be limited to none as the coverage and intensity of the snow diminishes throughout Saturday. The weekend will end on a cold, but quiet note.\nTemperatures will remain colder than average through the weekend and into next week, with daytime highs in the 20s and nighttime lows in the 10s. It isn’t record cold by any means, but it’ll be consistent through the second week of January, potentially beyond.\nHave a 30-second video or photo to share? We'd love to share it with everyone!
