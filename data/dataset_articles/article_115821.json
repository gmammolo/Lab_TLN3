  "text": "By Meredith Howard ,\n1 hours ago\nWhile the metro-east didn’t see a white Christmas this year, early January’s forecast calls for cold weather and the potential for frozen rain, sleet and snow.\nA winter storm watch is in effect in St. Clair, St. Louis and surrounding counties from Saturday evening through late Sunday night, according to the National Weather Service. Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the expected ice, the watch says, and travel could be “nearly impossible.”\nSnow and sleet accumulations could reach from 1 inch to 1 foot, the watch says, while ice accumulations could reach from 0.1 to 0.5 inches.\nThe National Weather Service St. Louis office forecasts Belleville will see sunny skies and temperatures from 22 to 34 degrees Fahrenheit Friday, Jan. 3 before a 60% chance of precipitation Saturday .\nWith a temperature range forecast from 24 to 31 degrees Saturday, Jan. 4 and 16 to 27 degrees Sunday, Jan. 5, Belleville could see frozen rain, sleet, snow or some mix of the three from Saturday night to the morning of Monday, Jan. 6, Chris Kimble, meteorologist with the NWS St. Louis office, said in a Thursday interview with the BND.\nHowever the precipitation turns out, forecasters expect road conditions will be negatively affected.\n“At this point we’re very confident that we’re going to see wintry travel impacts in our area on Sunday,” Kimble said.\nThe metro-east isn’t the only area expecting a winter storm soon. An arctic blast is expected to bring cold temperatures across the Eastern U.S., NBC News reported Wednesday.\nAcross the greater St. Louis region, residents farther north have a greater chance of snow, Kimble said, while those in the south are more likely to see freezing rain.\n“For those areas that stay freezing rain for a long time, that’s where we could see some significant icing, so not only icy travel conditions but also the potential for power outages,” Kimble said.\nAreas that see more snow could get several inches, Kimble said, and it may stick around for a while as colder temperatures move into the region.\n“Once this storm moves away, we’re actually going to get deep into that cold air, we’re expecting temperatures to stay below freezing just about all week next week,” Kimble said.\nMetro-east and St. Louis region residents can expect to see highs in the teens and 20s and lows as cold as zero degrees in the coming week, Kimble said.\nWhat to know about the forecast in Belleville, from the NWS:\nFriday: Sunny during the day and partly cloudy at night, with temperatures ranging from 22 to 34 degrees.\nSaturday: Partly sunny during the day, with temperatures from 24 to 31 degrees. There’s a 60% chance of precipitation, with ice accumulation up to 0.1 inch possible, as well as the potential for 1 to 3 inches of snow.\nSunday: Temperatures from 16 to 27 degrees with a 90% chance of precipitation and possible snow, freezing rain and sleet.\nMonday: Temperatures from 8 to 24 degrees, with a 20% chance of snow before noon.\nKimble said residents can expect cold temperatures next week, but there’s a chance the weekend of Saturday, Jan. 11 could bring temperatures back up closer to 32.\nHow to prepare for wintry conditions Since power outages are possible , Kimble recommends people make sure they have flashlights with batteries at home.\n“Definitely alter your travel plans if you can, avoid traveling in wintry conditions if you can. If not, make sure you have good tires on your car, have a shovel around so that you can dig yourself out if you get into a situation,” Kimble said.\nIf you can’t avoid being on the road Sunday or any other day with wintry weather conditions, here are some safety tips from the NWS:\nUse your headlights. Bright snow does not guarantee visibility.\nMake sure you have plenty of gas.\nLeave plenty of distance between yourself and other vehicles. It takes much longer for your car to come to a complete stop on slick roads.\nDrive slowly.\nAvoid unnecessary trips.\nCheck road conditions before you leave.\nYou can check live road conditions from the Illinois Department of Transportation and Missouri Department of Transportation .\nDo you have a question about the weather in Illinois for our service journalism team?
