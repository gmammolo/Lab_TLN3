  "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - The forecast is turning frigid as progressively colder air sweeps through the region, and with that comes with snow starting late Thursday night -- plus a major winter storm looming.\nThat snow should start just around midnight through 7 a.m. on Friday, potentially leaving a dusting of up to an inch. A Winter Weather Advisory has been issued for part of the Tri-State through 10 a.m. There's a chance for 1-2 inches for Fayette, Union Warren, Clinton and Highland counties.\nThe weekend promises even colder temperatures, with Saturday's highs not expected to reach the 30s. A major winter storm is on the horizon for late Sunday into Monday, with the potential for significant snowfall.\nThat develops around 8 a.m. and then heavier accumulation should begin close to 8 p.m. Expect significant travel impacts. Snow, sleet and freezing rain (ice) are all possible for the region.\nThe storm is still developing, so it is too early to predict snowfall amounts. This story will be updated with that information as it becomes available.\nThere will be bitter cold air next week, with highs in the teens and lows in the single digits, maybe colder.",
