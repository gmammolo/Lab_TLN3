  "text": "The dense fog has disrupted PIA's flight operations across several cities, including Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, and Sialkot, the national flag carrier's spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe spokesperson advised the passengers to provide correct and active contact numbers at the time of booking to facilitate timely communication regarding flight schedules and updates.\nThe statement noted that PIA prioritises the safety of its flight operations and urged the travellers to cooperate fully with airline staff and ground crew in the event of delays caused by fog. The airline emphasised that any non-cooperation from passengers could further delay flight departures.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our [Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",
