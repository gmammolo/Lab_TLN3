Sorry, we can't keep it in any longer!\nI’ve heard no eye contact or talking after a widespread front like this lessens the chance of bitterly cold air…— DuchessOfSalt👑💎 (@SaltyMom10)\n[https://t.co/WlsacODkjv] [January 2, 2025] [January 2, 2025]\nWe're told laughing at that one is Hypothermophobic.\nOh, look!
