  "text": "LALAMUSA: The district of Gujrat woke up to a thick shroud of fog on Thursday, causing a significant disruption across the region.Reduced visibility left commuters struggling, as bikers, bus drivers and car owners navigated the roads with extreme caution. The fog, which had begun to settle over the city the previous evening, intensified overnight, blanketing streets and highways in a dense fog-like cover by dawn.\nThe residents described the early morning as eerily quiet, with vehicles moving at a sluggish pace and headlights barely piercing through the haze. “The visibility was barely 10 to 15 meters,” said a local bus driver. “It felt dangerous to be on the road, but people had to get to work. We moved slowly and prayed there wouldn’t be any accidents.” Bikers, often the most vulnerable in such conditions, found the journey particularly challenging. Many were seen wearing masks and scarves to protect themselves from the thick, polluted air.\nHowever, by noon, the heavy blanket of smog began to dissipate as the sun pierced through the gloom. Temperatures rose slightly, and traffic began flowing more smoothly across the district. “It was like the city woke up again,” remarked a shop owner near Sargodha Road. “As soon as the sun appeared, everything felt normal. The smog was gone, and people were out and about.” Health experts continue to advise residents to wear masks and limit outdoor activities during periods of heavy smog. The district administration has also urged factories and brick kilns to reduce emissions, while traffic police have increased patrols to ensure road safety during low visibility hours.",
