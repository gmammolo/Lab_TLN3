  "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (WFXG) - An arctic cold blast, is what meteorologists are calling it. With another round of below freezing temperatures expected for next week. Many mornings will be below freezing may bring some potential dangers.\nHypothermia and frostbite are what doctors are most concerned about when the forecast dips below 32 degrees.\nWhich is a concern as students head to area bus stops to head back to the classroom.\n“That’s where our core body temperature reaches dangerously low levels. But we can also maintain core body temperatures, but get digits and have faces exposed and then we get a frostbite injury, which can be equally painful and devastating in its own right,” said Dr. Shawn Fagan, the Chief Medical Officer with the Burn and Reconstructive Centers of America at Doctors Hospital.\nSigns range from intense shivering to confusion.\n“If you see a child with cherry red, that's an indication that you're getting substantial exposure,” stated Dr. Fagan.\nEven slurred speech is an indicator.\nThe best tip is to get the person’s temperature back up to normal, is by gentle rewarming. But the best thing you can do with cold weather is preparation.\n\"Prevention is the key. It's just bundling up the children correctly. Bundling up so that they won't sweat. That they are in material that wicks sweat away,” said Dr. Fagan.\nSweat speeds up the cooling process, so Dr. Fagan recommends wearing moisture wicking layers for those who may be outside for an extended period of time.\nSome forecast models are even showing the possibility for wintry precipitation, such as snow. However, it is still up in the air in terms of the forecast. The FOX54 weather team will keep you up to date with your latest forecast.",
