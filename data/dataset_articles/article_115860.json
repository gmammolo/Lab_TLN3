  "text": "Chandigarh colder than Manali, Shimla despite sunny afternoon\nAt 13.2°C, the maximum temperature of the city was lower than Manali where the maximum temperature was 14.8°C\nThough the maximum temperature rose slightly due to the sunny conditions in the afternoon, Chandigarh was colder than hill stations such as Manali and Shimla on Thursday, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe temperatures are likely to drop further during the weekend with rain being predicted for Sunday and Monday.\nAt 13.2°C, the maximum temperature of the city was lower than Manali where the maximum temperature was 14.8°C. Even Shimla was much warmer at 17.2°C and Dharamshala at 22.9°C.\nThis comes even as maximum temperature of the city rose from 11.3°C on Wednesday. As Thursday’s day temperature was five degrees below normal, it was categorised as a cold day. A cold day is declared when the maximum temperature goes over 4.5 degrees below normal and minimum temperature drops below 10°C.\nThe minimum temperature fell from 8.7°C on Wednesday to 8.6°C on Thursday, still 1.4 degrees above normal. While many hill stations were colder at night, the city was still colder than Shimla where the minimum temperature on Thursday was 9.6°C.\nSpeaking about this, IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said, “This has to do with fog which blocks sunlight in the plains. However, we see brighter sunlight in the hills which is why sometimes the maximum temperature of Chandigarh sometimes drops lower than hill stations like Shimla and Dharamshala.”\nFlights delayed\nDense fog was recorded in the city on Thursday morning, with visibility going down to 150 metres around 5:30 am on Thursday. As per IMD, visibility between 50 metres and 200 metres is considered dense fog. Chances of dense fog will continue on Friday especially in the morning.\nA total of 10 flights, including four arrivals, were delayed at Chandigarh International Airport on Thursday due to fog.
