  "text": "Dense Fog Blinds North India As Cold Wave Tightens Grip, Flights Affected and Trains Delayed\nA thick layer of fog has blanketed the entire north India leading to reduced visibility and delays in train operations across cities.\nNorth India covered in dense fog.\nPhoto : PTI\nNew Delhi: A layer of dense fog has swept across north India with visibility reaching zero metres at many places. The mercury has fallen to record levels in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and the national capital Delhi among others. Visuals shared by news agency ANI show heavy fog covering the towns which has led to the delay in train operations as well.\nAirports have issued advisory for the travellers to check the status of their flights directly with their respective airlines as visibility has reduced significantly. Delhi airport said that visibility has gone down to zero metres and only CAT-III compliant aircraft would be able to conduct a smooth landing.\nA thick blanket of fog in Agra, Mathura and other towns of Uttar Pradesh has led to slow traffic movements. The iconic monument Taj Mahal was barely captured in the visuals as dense haze covered it.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the minimum temperature can touch the 10 degrees Celsius mark in the region while the maximum temperature is expected to be around 19 degrees Celsius in Agra on Friday. Visuals from Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior showed fog descending on roads blocking the sunlight in the region.\nIn Rajasthan's Jaipur, roads were seen heavily engulfed by a layer of fog and a similar scene was there in Amritsar where haze has drastically reduced the visibility and cold conditions have increased.\nThe grip of the cold wave has impacted the train operations with many running behind time. Passengers at New Delhi Railway Station were seen waiting for their trains which have been delayed due to the fog.\nGet\n[Latest News](https://www.timesnownews.com/latest-news)Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from[India](https://www.timesnownews.com/india)and around the world.Ajay Kumar author\nAjay works on the Times Now news desk and covers national news, crime, city centric among others.
