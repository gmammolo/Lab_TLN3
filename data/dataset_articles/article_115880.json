  "text": "Dense fog, resembling rain, has blanketed Dhaka, intensifying a cold wave that has disrupted public life. For two consecutive days, the sun has remained obscured, as icy winds and persistent mist amplify the city’s chill.\nSince early Friday morning, Dhaka has been shrouded in a thick fog that has drenched the streets and forced vehicles to drive with their headlights on, even well past sunrise. By 8:30 AM, the sun was still nowhere in sight, casting an eerie, muted light over the city.\nBeing a holiday, the streets were less crowded, but those venturing out struggled against the biting cold and rain-like mist. Despite wearing multiple layers, many found it hard to stay warm.\nThe hardest hit are the working class and homeless, who rely on sunlight and scarce warm clothing to fend off the winter’s chill. The city recorded its lowest temperature of the season at 13.8°C, further compounding the hardship for those most vulnerable.\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, the dense fog and cold wave are expected to persist for another two to three days. A statement by meteorologist Md Omar Faruq indicated that day and night temperatures might see a slight rise until Sunday evening, but the dense fog and icy winds will continue to create severe cold conditions in some areas.\nModerate to dense fog is predicted to blanket the country from midnight to noon, potentially disrupting air traffic, river transport, and road communication. While the weather is expected to remain mostly dry with partly cloudy skies over the coming days, the extended five-day forecast suggests light rain or drizzle may occur in the northern regions, likely causing temperatures to drop further by the end of the period.\nThe combination of fog, mist, and icy winds has brought public life in Dhaka to a standstill. Roads are slick with moisture, visibility is low, and the cold is unrelenting. For the city's most vulnerable—laborers and the homeless—this has been an especially harsh ordeal, as they face the challenge of staying warm in the absence of sufficient resources or sunlight.\nAs Dhaka braces for continued cold and foggy conditions, residents are urged to exercise caution, particularly when traveling, and to prepare for potential disruptions in transport and communication.\nBd-pratidin English/ Jisan",
