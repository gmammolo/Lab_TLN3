  "text": "Some areas in southern Ontario are under major snow squall warnings as up to 60 centimetres of snow is expected.\nOn Thursday, Environment Canada issued snow squall warnings for multiple cities and towns surrounding Lake Superior, Huron and Georgian Bay, including Barrie, Bracebridge, Orillia, Midland, and Newmarket, among other cottage country regions.\n“The areas that will be the most highly impacted would be for today into Friday morning, that would be areas to the south of Georgian Bay, as well as areas like the Bruce Peninsula and Blue Mountain, you know, northern Grey County,” Environment Canada Meteorologist Trudy Kidd told Now Toronto on Thursday.\nAn updated look 👀 at the alerts in effect for Ontario this morning ⬇️\n🌨️ Snow Squall Warnings and Winter Weather Travel Advisories continue today due to lake effect snow off Lake Superior, Huron and Georgian Bay. 🚘\nAlert details ⚠️ https://t.co/dFO3ZdOszf #ONStorm #ONWx pic.twitter.com/Sx4Wf5as5d\n— ECCC Weather Ontario (@ECCCWeatherON) January 2, 2025 “Some areas could see 60 centimeters of snow by Friday morning. And then other areas to the east of Lake Huron, like Southern Bruce County and northern Huron County into northern Wellington County, some areas could see 40 centimeters,” she continued.\nKidd says the snow storms are a result of lake effect snow which is why areas southeast and south of Lake Simcoe are expected to receive the most snowfall accumulation.\nEnvironment Canada says snow squalls can cause weather conditions to “vary considerably” from clear skies to heavy snow within a few kilometres radius.\nIt’s also warning drivers that visibility can be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow causing hazardous travel conditions.\n“Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow. Road closures are possible. If visibility is reduced while driving, slow down, watch for tail lights ahead and be prepared to stop,” Environment Canada said.\nCloser to the Greater Toronto Area, areas such as Caledon, Kitchener, Guelph and Lindsay can expect to see up to 10 centimetres of snow.\nMeanwhile in Toronto, there is no weather warning but light snow and cold temperatures are still forecasted. Mainly cloudy conditions are expected Thursday with a 70 per cent chance of flurries and wind gusts of up to 50 km/h this morning. Today’s high is 1 C with a low of -3 C in the evening, feeling like -9 with the wind chill.\nOn Friday, the cloudy conditions are expected to continue coupled with a 60 per cent chance of flurries, a high of 1 C and a low of -9 C.\nSaturday is predicted to see a 60 per cent chance of flurries with a high of -4 C and a low of -9 C. Similar conditions are expected on Sunday with a mix of sun and cloud and a 40 per cent chance of flurries. A high of -4 C is expected on Sunday and a low of -9 C.",
