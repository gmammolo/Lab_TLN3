  "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 01:24 AM UTC\nAustralia: High temperatures likely to persist over northwestern and southeastern regions through at least Jan. 8 /update 1\nHeatwave to persist over northwestern and southeastern Australia through at least Jan. 8. Increased risk of bushfires in affected areas.\nHigh temperatures are forecast to persist across parts of northwestern and southeastern Australia through at least Jan. 8. Temperatures in excess of 44 C (111 F) are likely across parts of the affected area over the coming days. As of Jan. 3, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has issued severe heatwave warnings across South Coast and Snowy Mountains districts in New South Wales, East Gippsland and West and South Gippsland districts in Queensland, and Furneaux Islands, North East, and East Coast districts in Tasmania. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming days. Severe and low-intensity heatwave conditions are forecast over much of the rest of the affected area over the coming days.\nThe extended period of oppressive heat and dry conditions may produce ideal circumstances for bushfire growth throughout the affected regions. Heatwaves also threaten vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, children, pregnant women, and those with respiratory illnesses - due to the increased possibility of heat stroke or heat exhaustion during prolonged exposure to high temperatures. These health risks could also extend to relatively healthy individuals during significant heatwave events. In addition to significantly impacting athletes and those who work outdoors, high temperatures can cause problems for people using mass transit. The lack of air conditioning and cramped vehicles during rush hour may lead to some passengers' hospitalization.\nVery high temperatures may damage road surfaces, and overheated vehicles may worsen traffic problems in urban areas where congestion is already a problem. Commercial trucking disruptions might occur, as very high temperatures put more stress on vehicles, making tire blowouts more common. Major flight disruptions are unlikely at regional airports, but general aviation disruptions are possible, and some airfreight carriers could reduce cargo loads. High temperatures could lead to an increased demand for electricity, which might trigger localized brownouts or blackouts, exacerbating hazardous conditions when air conditioning is no longer possible.\nMonitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. During heatwaves, remain indoors in air conditioning when possible. If outdoor activities are necessary, frequently rest in shaded areas; avoid activity during the hottest times of the day. Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Avoid alcoholic beverages, which are dehydrating; drink bottled or boiled water. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing. Cotton fabrics are more cooling than synthetics. Promptly seek medical attention if signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke develop. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",
