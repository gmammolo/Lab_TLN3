  "text": "Dhurandhar Box Office Collection Day 41: Starring Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Sara Arjun, Arjun Rampal, and Akshaye Khanna, Dhurandhar was a box office smash. But as time goes on, Dhurandhar’s collections are sliding downward.\nDhurandhar box office collection\nOn the 41st day of its release, Dhurandhar ‘s collections have once again seen a decline, which must have increased the tension for the makers. So, let’s find out how much the movie did on Wednesday.\nDhurandhar’s earnings decline\nEven good films start to see da ecline after more than 40 days in theaters. A similar trend is being seen with Dhurandhar, directed by Aditya Dhar. Since last Sunday, Dhurandhar has failed to deliver its usual success on working days, and the movie’s collections have been declining, as can be gauged by its earnings on the 41st day of release.\nAccording to a report by Sacnilk, the spy thriller Dhurandhar grossed around ₹2 crore on its 41st day, marking the lowest gross for the film to date. Dhurandhar’s total box office collection has now surpassed ₹865 crore. If Dhurandhar’s collections continue at this pace, surpassing the ₹900 crore mark will be a major challenge.\nHowever, Dhurandhar has already earned profits many times its budget. Therefore, the film’s earnings, whether high or low, won’t have any significant impact. It’s worth noting that media reports indicate the total cost of this Ranveer Singh-starrer is estimated to be around 250 crore rupees, making Dhurandhar a significant profit.\nDhurandhar worldwide collection\nDhurandhar is performing well not only at the Indian box office but also in the international market. Thanks to its impressive commercial performance, Dhurandhar has grossed over ₹13 billion worldwide. It’s worth noting that no other Hindi film, other than Dangal, has surpassed this global gross.",
