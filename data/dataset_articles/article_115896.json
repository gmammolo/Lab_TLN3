  "text": "- By\n[Aditya Jha](/authors/aditya-jha) - Published: Fri, 03 Jan 2025 09:37 AM (IST)\n- Source:JND\nAmid dense fog and light rain in Northern States, including Delhi, several of the flights and trains have been delayed. The dense fog has led to a significant dip in temperature and has also reduced the visibility in these areas. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday stated that Delhiites might experience light rainfall in upcoming days, and the temperature over the city recorded a maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 7.6 degrees Celsius in the last 24 hours.\nDelhi Airport, in a passenger advisory, informed the passengers about the disruptions and instructed them to contact the concerned airline for updates in flight information before the journey. \"While landings and take-offs continue at Delhi Airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" the advisory stated.\nALSO READ: [Delhi Weather Update: Dense Fog Affects Visibility, IMD Issues Orange Alert](https://english.jagran.com/india/delhi-ncr-weather-update-dense-fog-affects-visibility-imd-predicts-further-temperature-dip-orange-alert-video-10210299)\nEarlier on Thursday, FlightRadar24 informed that the flights of SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Air India were affected as the average delay of flights in the capital city was five minutes for arrival flights and 11 minutes for departure flights.
