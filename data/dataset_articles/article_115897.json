  "text": "A Heavy Rain Warning is now in force for the whole of Fiji Group while a Flash Flood Alert remains in force for all low lying, flash flood prone areas and small streams of Fiji. The Nadi Weather Office says an active trough of low pressure, with associated cloud and rain, continues to affect the entire Fiji Group. They say heavy rainfall may result in flash flooding in low-lying, flood-prone areas and small streams. The National Disaster Risk Management Office is urging the public to remain vigilant for possible flash flooding in low-lying areas, informal settlements, small streams, and Irish crossings, which could disrupt traffic flow. They advise drivers to exercise extra caution when driving, as roads have deteriorated due to the continuous rainfall experienced over the past few days.",
