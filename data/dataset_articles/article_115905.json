  "text": "Local Hailstorm Causes Multiple Road Slips Between Feanwâlden and De Westereen\nA localized winter hailstorm resulted in several road slip incidents on the Central Axis and the Boppewei between Feanwâlden and De Westereen. The hail primarily fell around the Tuincentrum Tuin area.\nThe first incident occurred around 20:10 on the Central Axis (heading towards Drachten ). Police , an ambulance, and a tow truck arrived at the scene to provide initial assistance. It’s unknown if anyone was injured. The tow truck removed the vehicle from the scene.\nGlasy Central Axis\nAnother driver reportedly lost control due to the hail making the road extremely slippery on the Central Axis. Police continued to warn motorists about the icy conditions even after the initial incident was cleared. Coincidentally, another accident occurred on the Boppewei heading towards De Westereen.\nCar Ends Up in Ditch\nOn the Boppewei, a driver lost control and ended up in a ditch. A woman and a boy were in the car but escaped unharmed. Alongside police, firefighters also attended the scene but were not required to intervene. A tow truck later pulled the car out of the ditch.\nThe hailstorm was localized, with no hail or snow found on the roads surrounding the incident locations.",
