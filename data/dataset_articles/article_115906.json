  "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Arkansans should enjoy the tranquil weather up until Saturday ... because by Sunday the weather pattern will take a drastic turn.\nA cold front will swing through the state on Sunday afternoon as warm and humid air will surge ahead in advance of the cold front which will be setting the stage for the chance of a few storms that could be strong or severe.\nOn Sunday, temperatures could climb well into the 60s and the greatest chance of severe weather, which is low at this time, is for areas south and east of Little Rock. Any storm that can reach its maximum potential if enough storm fuel is in place could produce damaging winds, hail and [or] a tornado.\nCurrently, the threat of a tornado is low as there is a lack of storm fuel expected. The latest Storm Prediction Center outlook that was issued Thursday morning shows the severe weather potential extending from Arkansas into Louisiana and Mississippi.\nOnce the cold front passes through, the temperatures will drop quickly from the 60s around 1 p.m. on Sunday to the low 30s by Sunday evening.\nYou can expect gusty winds from the north and northwest at 15-30 mph that will usher in the frigid air mass through Sunday night into Monday. Temps by sunrise on Monday are expected to be in the low to mid 20s.\nYou combine those chilly readings with the biting winds and it will feel like temperatures are in the teens and single digits to begin the day.\nFreezing temperatures in Arkansas 1/5 KTHV11 Weather 2/5 THV11 Weather 3/5 KTHV11 Weather 4/5 KTHV11 Weather 5/5 THV11 Weather 1 / 5 × KTHV11 Weather More The cold blast will linger over Arkansas for most of next week. Temperatures Monday to Wednesday may not even climb above freezing for the Ozark and higher elevations. Some unprotected pipes could freeze, so make sure your outside faucets are covered and protected.\nAs for the chance of any winter weather for the next 7 days, the chance is low.\nSunday evening into Sunday night, any leftover moisture behind the front could change over to a few flakes of snow. Currently no impacts are expected.\nAs a heads up, if you are traveling north in Missouri Sunday and Monday, it's likely that winter weather impacts will be significant from ice and snow.\nWe will be watching for another chance of winter weather from Wednesday to Friday, but the confidence is slim on this scenario at this time. There is little model agreement on what will play out, but with arctic air in place the pattern does favor a chance.\nStay tuned to the THV11 Weather Impact Team. We will give you the information you need to know responsibly and leave out the hype.\nRelated Articles Cole Jester sworn in as 35th Arkansas Secretary of State How Arkansans can prep their vehicles as state prepares for below-freezing temps Here's how to apply for LIHEAP assistance in 2025 Close Ad",
