  "text": "IMPACT WEATHER AHEAD\nAdvertisement We designate days as “Impact Days” when weather significantly affects your daily routine.\nSunday, Monday, and Tuesday will be \"Impact Days\" in North and Central Alabama as a strong Arctic front blasts into the region.\nSUNDAY: Sunday morning will start out cloudy, calm, and chilly, but the day will end with a risk of a few severe storms, mainly over the far western part of Alabama and westward into Mississippi.\nWVTM 13 WVTM 13\nTIMING: Rain and thunderstorms will move through Alabama between 6 p.m. Sunday and 3 a.m. Monday.\nIMPACTS: Alabama’s risk of severe thunderstorms will be very low due to a lack of instability; however, strong wind gusts over 40 to 50 miles per hour are possible ahead of the main wave of rain and storms. Within the line, wind gusts could reach 60 miles per hour in isolated areas.\nBOTTOM LINE: Prepare for sporadic power outages on Sunday, Sunday night, and Monday as this windy storm system blows through the region. Expect around half an inch to one inch of rainfall by Monday morning. MONDAY AND TUESDAY: WVTM 13 The Arctic front will surge through Alabama early Monday morning, and a stiff northwest wind at 15 to 25 miles per hour will drive bitterly cold air into the state.\nMonday’s highest temperature will occur around sunrise (in the 50s), and it will get progressively colder throughout the day. The wind chill will plunge into the 20s and 10s by Monday afternoon, as air temperatures hover in the 30s.\nTuesday will be similar with a stiff northwest wind and a feels like temperature in the 10s and 20s.\nTIMING: Very cold air will impact us all day Monday through Tuesday. IMPACTS: The wind chill will fall into the 10s and 20s from late Monday morning through the afternoon and evening. It could feel as cold as 10 to 15 degrees on Tuesday morning. BOTTOM LINE: Prepare for much colder weather early next week.",
