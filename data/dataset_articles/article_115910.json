  "text": "By Courtney Travis ,\n3 hours ago Over a dozen states could see travel-snarling ice and snow, while other areas brace for a new round of severe weather as a major storm tracks across the United States.\nA massive storm is expected to bring both wintry and severe weather to millions of Americans as early as this weekend, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.\n\"Over a dozen states are forecast to be impacted by one or more aspects of this storm,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.\nThe storm emerging from the Rockies late on Saturday is forecast to deliver a far-reaching swath of ice and snow across the middle of the country while rain and thunderstorms spread across the southern tier of the United States.\nSnow, ice to sweep Central states this weekend The intrusion of bitterly cold, Arctic air into the middle of the country will set the stage for wintry weather in the Plains, starting on Saturday. Snowflakes could fly as far south as northern Oklahoma. Meanwhile, enough snow to shovel and plow will extend for about 1,000 miles from central Nebraska to Ohio through early Monday.\n\"The accumulating snow, which could approach or exceed a half of a foot is expected to bring travel to a stand still in places like Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Cincinnati,\" said Buckingham.\nAn AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 30 inches is most likely to occur somewhere from northern Missouri to west-central Illinois.\nJust to the south, parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana are forecast to experience ice mixing with snow during the storm, which can limit the amount of total snow accumulation. A difficult battle between warm and cold air will determine exactly how much snow, versus ice, falls in some areas like Kansas City and St. Louis in Missouri. A change of just 20-30 miles farther south with the track of the storm could result in much more snow and less ice.\n\"A major freezing rain event is expected to unfold, making for dangerous ice accretions across the northern Ozarks, middle Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley this weekend,\" Buckingham said.\nCommunities from Springfield, Missouri, to Lexington, Kentucky, could be in for a substantial amount of ice that brings dangerous travel conditions. Additionally, this much ice can weigh down tree limbs, increasing the chance for tree damage and resulting power outages.\n\"Power outages, extensive tree damage and lengthy travel days will be a concern in the worst-hit areas,\" said Buckingham.\nThe power could be out for several days in some communities when dangerously cold air invades in the wake of the storm. There may be a great need for shelters to be set up to account for the affected population.\nEven a trace of icing can lead to a coating on cars and cause slippery spots, especially on bridges and overpasses. Untreated roads or sidewalks could be slick for much of the weekend.\nFar-reaching cold following behind the storm could pave the way for more wintry weather in the same zones as January continues.\nSevere thunderstorms to spark again in southern US Some of the same states still reeling from last weekend's severe weather will once again need to watch for severe thunderstorms with the coming storm.\nThe potent storm will bring a clash of cold air in the Plains, and warm moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will help to fuel the severe weather chances on Sunday.\n\"A line of thunderstorms is expected to develop across eastern Texas Sunday afternoon, strengthening as they move into Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama through Sunday night,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Gwen Fieweger.\nFieweger also warns that many storms in the Interstate 10 and 20 corridors could bring damaging wind gusts, hail and flooding downpours, but a few thunderstorms may also be capable of producing a few tornadoes.\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+ Disruptive snow, ice in Northeast and mid-Atlantic to start week After dumping snow and ice across the center of the country, portions of the East Coast will be next to endure the winter weather.\n\"Residents and visitors across the mid-Atlantic states are also in line to deal with the first winter storm in quite some time, posing a major risk to travel between Sunday night and Monday evening,\" Buckingham warned.\nAccumulating snow is expected to reach as far north as central Pennsylvania and extend southward through northern Virginia. Major metro areas such as Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., can expect several inches of accumulation.\n\"The western suburbs of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., could have snowfall totals nearing half a foot by the end of the storm,\" said Buckingham. The higher terrain in West Virginia and western Maryland are the most likely to see totals near the AccuWeather Local StormMax™ of 15 inches.\nSlippery conditions can be expected as the storm moves into the area, disrupting travel. The heaviest snow late Sunday night and into Monday morning could lead to longer commute times in bustling hubs like Philadelphia.\nLocations across central Virginia and the Carolinas are unlikely to see much snow accumulation, but cold air will create sleet and freezing rain instead.\nSleet and freezing rain are likely to be most extensive near the Appalachians, but the ice could reach the beaches of Virginia late on Sunday night, continuing into Monday before the storm moves offshore.\nLingering cold air in the wake of this storm will likely keep any snow or ice around for several days after the end of the storm. The lack of warm air will also leave open the door for more wintry storms to sweep through the region into mid-January.\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?
