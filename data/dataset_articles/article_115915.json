  "text": "Title: Snowy Commute: Bus Struggles Disrupt Travel in Bergen\nThis evening, Bergen experienced significant traffic disruptions due to heavy snowfall and adverse road conditions , with numerous buses encountering difficulties, particularly near the Puddefjordsbroen. Bergen Avisen received reports of a bus breakdown in the vicinity, causing delays and closures, especially in the Sydnestunnelen.\nA local resident, Joakim Hjertholm, discovered the stranded bus while out walking his dog. Upon returning home, he shared that while car traffic could bypass the issue, buses were unable to maneuver around the obstruction and were left waiting.\n\"From what I could see, the bus had collided with a barrier,\" Hjertholm reported. \"It seemed to have hit it with the black part of the vehicle, so there weren’t significant damages.\"\nTrafikkoperatør Marianne Hove confirmed receiving multiple reports of buses facing challenges due to the snow. By 10:20 PM, theбайс, the bus had managed to free itself, but residual delays persisted. Several buses were queued up, heading westward over the Puddefjordsbroen.\nSkyss ‘ press contact, Øyvind Strømmen, verified that one of their line 6 buses faced issues, likely due to poor road conditions. This led to a backup in the aftermath.\nIn a later update, Skyss reported that a total of 71 lines were affected by the snowy conditions. However, by 10:45 PM, the number of affected lines had significantly decreased:\nAffected Lines: 3, 4, 5, 6, 19, 27, 29, 40, 50E, 67, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76, 83, 441, 445, 460, 484, 499, 910.\nAnother bus stood stationary for an extended period on E39 near the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). Meanwhile, Bybanen also struggled with delays on both of its lines due to the snowy weather.\nAs the city braces for more winter weather, commuters are advised to check their routes and allow for additional travel time.",
