This prompted Delhi airport authorities on Friday issued an advisory and stated that flights which were not CAT III compliant would get affected. In Delhi, the minimum temperature at 5:30 am was 9.6 degrees Celsius, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The fog situation is likely to remain in Delhi till January 8, the IMD predicted. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an \"Orange Alert\" for fog in Delhi-NCR, warning of extremely low visibility. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city was recorded as 348 at the 'very poor' category. The Central Pollution Control Board also pegged the AQI index at Lodhi Road station is 309. Many residents were seen huddling around bonfires or seeking warmth in night shelters. The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) set up 235 pagoda tents to provide shelter to homeless people. Night shelters have been set up in several areas of the national capital, including AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin flyover.
