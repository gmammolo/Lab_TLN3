  "text": "We are kicking off the first weekend of the new year with our first significant winter storm of the season.\nThe forecast is quiet for Saturday, however. Expect an increase in clouds throughout the day with some sunshine. It will be a very chilly afternoon as high temperatures struggle to reach the low 30s.\nThings take a turn Sunday morning as a mix of wintry precipitation moves in. This winter storm will likely start as snow. However, as a pocket of warmer air above our heads moves into the region, snow will change over to a wintry mix.\nWhat remains unclear of this writing is exactly what type of precipitation will take over — sleet, freezing rain, etc. — and how much will accumulate.\nSignificant travel issues are likely Sunday afternoon into Sunday night and much of Monday. Power outages are possible depending on how much icing occurs.\nStay with the WAVE Storm Tracking Team throughout the weekend on television, online, and on the WAVE Weather App as we get closer to this winter storm.\nBehind the weekend storm, a long stretch of cold weather takes control. Temperatures may struggle to get above the freezing mark for at least a week. Overnight lows in the single digits are expected by the middle of next week as well. Stay warm and stay safe!\nWEEKEND FORECAST\nSATURDAY\nPartly Cloudy | Cold\nHIGH: 33°\nSUNDAY\nALERT DAY | Wintry Mix (80%)\nHIGH: 32°",
