  "text": "ST. LOUIS — Road crews across the bi-state are preparing for a mixed bag of winter weather conditions this weekend.\nThe National Weather Service said the last few winters haven't brought a lot of snow to the bi-state but the storm system moving in this weekend could have a widespread impact that reaches the east coast.\n“Some of the amounts that we're seeing that are in some of the model data, could top the Groundhog Day 2022 storm. That was February 2nd and 3rd of 2022. St. Louis received almost seven inches of snow, that time Columbia was almost 10 inches,” NWS St. Louis Meteorologist Jared Maples said.\nMaples said with the freezing rain, sleet and snow combination, they're particularly concerned about ice on the power lines and the roads.\n“There's kind of this false perception that if I have four-wheel drive, I can drive on ice. That’s completely false. There is no traction in the freezing rain,” Maples added.\nThe Illinois Department of Transportation said they're still dealing with staffing challenges and are trying their best to put their resources in the right place.\n“If the forecast holds, I don't think folks from the south will be able to help us much because they'll be dealing with freezing rain. So now if the setup is that north of us gets heavier snow, we're preparing as if we're going to be on an island and have to handle this ourselves,” IDOT District 8 Engineer Joe Monroe said.\nMaples said the last significant ice storm was in 2009 when some areas received an inch of ice.\n“But when you get that type of weight, that water weight, that is sticking to the tree branches and you start to add wind, especially in those cases, you're talking about tree limbs down, power lines down, that could be power outages that could last days in some cases,” Maples said.\nHe said single-digit temperatures right after this storm will make whatever precipitation we do get stick around for a while and even refreeze, which can cause issues for road crews and drivers...\n“The challenge will be real and the mobility will be compromised at points during that event,” Monroe said.\nThe National Weather Service said if you need to get out and go get some food or run other errands, the last chance to do that safely is during the day on Saturday.\nThe 5 On Your Side team will keep you updated so you know exactly what's going on throughout this storm.",
