  "text": "Icy road woes for dirt roads\n“The snow is melting and once it gets nighttime or later in the day, temperatures start dropping even more and now we’re going to start having ice on the roads”\nLANSING, Mich. (WILX) - The weather has made it a challenge to keep dirt roads in tip-top shape.\n“The snow is melting and once it gets nighttime or later in the day, temperatures start dropping even more and now we’re going to start having ice on the roads,” said Lieutenant Rene Gonzalez with Michigan State Police.\nOn Tuesday, the Clinton County Road Commission took to Facebook to express how tough it is to maintain the gravel roads during cold temperatures and warn people to expect potential delays.\n“The main thing we tell drivers is don’t panic if you start losing control of your vehicle, but a lot of people have an instinct of just hitting the brake once you apply that brake you lose control of your vehicle completely,” said Lieutenant Gonzalez.\nOn dirt roads, it can be even scarier. Gravel roads are extremely slippery due to a lack of traction, but adding a layer of ice exacerbates the problem.\n“If you lose control of your vehicle, take your foot off the gas, do not apply the brake, steer your vehicle in the location that you want to go to, and look at that location then you’re going to start feeling your vehicle starts to gain control, you’re going to feel those tires grab, and then slowly accelerate out of the spin,” said Lieutenant Gonzalez.\nSubscribe to our\n[News 10 newsletter](https://www.wilx.com/newsletter/) and [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@wilxtv) to receive the latest local news and weather.
