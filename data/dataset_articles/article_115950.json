  "text": "Tonight: Rain and wind continues as we switch over to the night. Wind will crank up even more, especially for areas along the coast, in our higher elevations, and in the Shasta valley. Rain will also pick up and snow levels will remain higher. Areas west and along the Cascades, heaviest rates near coastal areas. It will remain mild overnight with highs in the upper 40s for the coast and the mid 40s for the westside valleys. East of the Cascades it will be chilly but not as cold with lows in the mid to upper 30s.\nExtended: Wet weather will continue through Friday, but we will see lower snow levels. More rounds of precipitation will carry through Friday and Saturday. With the lower snow levels, expect some slippery travel into the weekend for higher passes.\nOn Sunday, we should see a little break in the action for most of the region. It's possible we could get one last round of rain and mountain snow Monday night into Tuesday before we begin a drier weather pattern through the rest of next week.\nKDRV.com",
