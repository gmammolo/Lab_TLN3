  "text": "Odisha on Friday woke up to chilling cold as the state once again witnessed a return of chillier weather on the third day of New Year 2025. Cooler air from the north-northeast caused a significant drop in temperatures, with a drop of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius in several areas.\nMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the current spell will persist over the next four to five days. The forecast signals more cold across the state in the next four to five days and further decrease in temperature.\nSome regions may face temperatures dropping below 10 degree Celsius. Additionally, several regions might experience light to moderate fog, potentially affecting visibility.\nAlso Read: Odisha shivers under cold wave, 8 cities record temperature below 10 degree Celsius\nOn Thursday, at least eight regions in Odisha experienced temperatures below 10 degree Celsius. As per regional weather office, Rourkela emerged as the coldest city with below 7 degree Celsius followed by Jharsuguda with 8 degree Celsius.\nKeonjhar, Phulbani and Daringbadi recorded 9.5 degree Celsius while Sundargarh shivered at 9.7 degree Celsius. On the other hand, Angul and Sonepur shivered at 10 degree Celsius. The twin city of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar witnessed temperatures of 13 and 13.2 degrees Celsius respectively.\nThe dip is expected to continue and severe cold conditions are predicted to last for at least the next four to five days, the weather department warned.\nMeanwhile, residents have been advised to exercise caution, especially during early mornings and late evenings. The IMD has urged everyone to take measures to stay warm as the cold wave extends its reach.
