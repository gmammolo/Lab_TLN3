Temperatures are predicted to drop by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius ( °C ), with Bangkok experiencing lows of 20 °C and frost expected in mountainous areas.\nThe TMD forecasts that the high-pressure system or moderate cool air mass from China has already spread across northern Vietnam and is anticipated to reach northern Thailand today. This will lead to a further drop in temperatures by 1 or 2 °C in the northern and northeastern regions, bringing cool to cold conditions in the mornings. The central region, including Bangkok and its surrounding areas, along with the eastern and upper southern regions, will also experience cooler mornings.\nAdvertisements In the mountainous areas, the weather will be cold to very cold, with some places potentially seeing frost. The mountain tops will be particularly chilly. Residents in the upper parts of Thailand and the upper southern regions are advised to take care of their health due to the cold weather and to be cautious of potential fire hazards due to the dry air. Additionally, caution is advised when travelling in areas where fog is present.\nThe northeast monsoon continues to cover the Gulf of Thailand, the southern region , and the Andaman Sea , leading to light rain in some parts of the lower southern region. The wind and wave conditions in the Gulf of Thailand are moderate, with waves reaching 1 to 2 metres in height, and waves over 2 metres in areas experiencing thunderstorms. Mariners in these areas are advised to navigate carefully and avoid areas with thunderstorms.\nRelated news Lucky day: Man celebrates 6 million baht lottery win in Nong Khai Published: 16:27, 03 January 2025 Phuket boosts marine safety with smart pier inspection Published: 16:04, 03 January 2025 Dust accumulation remains a concern in the upper parts of Thailand, where levels are moderate to high. This is attributed to poor to moderate ventilation rates and weak winds covering the region.\nWeather forecast\nThe weather forecast for Thailand from 6am today to 6am tomorrow indicates that the northern region will experience cool to cold mornings with temperatures dropping by 1 or 2 °C . The lowest temperatures will range from 13 to 16 °C , while the highest will be between 28 and 33 °C .

Northeast winds will blow at speeds of 15 to 35km/h, with sea waves reaching 1 to 2 metres and waves exceeding 2 metres in thunderstorm areas.\nOn the west coast of the southern region, cool mornings with light rain in some parts of the lower region are expected. Minimum temperatures will range from 22 to 25 °C , with maximum temperatures between 32 and 34 °C . Northeast winds will blow at speeds of 15 to 30km/h, with sea waves under 1 metre and waves about 1 metre high offshore.\nIn Bangkok and its vicinity, cool mornings are predicted, with temperatures dropping by 1 to 2 °C . The minimum temperature will be between 20 and 22 °C , with a maximum of 32 to 34 °C .
