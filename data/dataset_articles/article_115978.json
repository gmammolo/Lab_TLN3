  "text": "Weather latest: Snow warnings as NHS board says to avoid going outside in morning or night amid icy conditions\nCold snap set to grip country with snow possible across large areas over weekend\nMore [snow](/topic/snow) and ice is forecast across swathes of the [UK](/topic/uk) on Thursday, as an NHS board warned people to avoid going outside in the early morning and late at night when conditions are more hazardous.\nTwo new Met Office [weather](/weather) warnings – in northeast Scotland, and in parts of Scotland, England and in Northern Ireland – came into force on Thursday afternoon, with Britons told to expect icy conditions and delays to their journeys until at least Friday morning.\nA [three-day yellow snow warning](/news/uk/home-news/snow-weather-uk-met-office-forecast-mapped-b2672680.html) will soon follow, as most of England, southern Scotland and all of Wales are told to brace for snow from noon on Saturday until Monday morning.\nTravel delays and power cuts are likely in the most affected areas of the Midlands, Wales and northern England, which could see anything between 5cm and 30cm of snow.\nWarning of the potential for slips and falls, the NHS Black Country integrated care board said: “Avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark.”\nIt comes as devastating scenes of flooding were seen in Manchester on New Year’s Day, with Greater Manchester Police declaring a major incident.\nFull list of weather warnings as Britons told to brace for freezing weather\nThe Met Office has issued four weather warnings in the coming days as the UK welcomes in 2025 with a cold snap.\nThe forecasters have told Britons to prepare for freezing temperatures, ice and up to 30cm of snow over the weekend.\n• Thursday 4pm to Friday 10am: Yellow snow and ice warning for northeast Scotland.\n• Thursday 5pm to Friday 10am: Yellow ice warning for northwest Scotland, northwest England and parts of Northern Ireland.\n• Saturday 12pm to Monday 9am: Yellow snow warning for most of England, southern Scotland and all of Wales.\n• Sunday 12am to Monday 12pm: Yellow snow warning for most of Scotland.\nCold snap ‘could put elderly at risk of death’ as fuel payments cap criticised\nAn imminent cold snap could put the elderly at risk of death, the UK Health Security Agency has warned, as a charity criticised the Government’s decision to limit winter fuel payments.\nThe UKHSA has issued cold weather health amber alerts from 12pm on Thursday until January 8 meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely.\nAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said the Government’s decision to limit the winter fuel allowance to only the poorest pensioners will be put “into sharp relief” by the cold snap.\nMs Abrahams said the charity had already been contacted by older people “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.\nFrom this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments while more than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance.\n“We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm, even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford,” the charity director said. “The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling and there may be support available from your local council too.”\nFlood water in York after the River Ouse
