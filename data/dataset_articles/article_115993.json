But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nThe NHS Black Country integrated care board has warned the public to “avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark”, adding people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.\nIn Herefordshire, the Wye Valley NHS Trust told people to “have sufficient food and medicine and take measures to reduce draughts in your home”.\nAge UK director Caroline Abrahams said the Government’s decision to limit the winter fuel allowance to only the poorest pensioners will be put “into sharp relief” by the cold snap.\nMs Abrahams said the charity had already been contacted by older people “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.\nFrom this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments while more than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance.\nSlips, trips and falls become more likely during icy weather conditions, so it’s important to be mindful of the weather before setting off.\nKeep your hands free Wear shoes with good grip Avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark. pic.twitter.com/fb1NtZVRHO\n— NHS Black Country Integrated Care Board (ICB) (@NHSinBlkCountry) January 2, 2025\nThe charity director said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm, even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford.\n“The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling and there may be support available from your local council too.”Meanwhile, fresh weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office for ice ahead of a blast of snow over the weekend.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland.\nIt will remain in place from 5pm on Thursday until 10am on Friday morning, and could make for difficult travelling conditions, the forecaster warned.\nA snow and ice warning is also in place covering parts of northern Scotland between 4pm on Thursday and 10am on Friday.\nA yellow warning is in place from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday and covers all regions of England, other than the South West, the majority of Wales and parts of southern Scotland.\nElderly people have been urged to stay warm (PA)\nAbout 5cm of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England, with as much as 20-30cm over high ground in Wales and the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nStrong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.\nMet Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”\nThe Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling with longer journey times likely.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.\nPoor weather is currently affecting National Rail’s Northern and ScotRail services.\nA cold northerly airflow dominated the weather on Thursday with clear skies for many, but wintry showers in the north and east\nHere are the extremes for Thursday the 2nd January 2025 pic.twitter.com/TlBdTlClFy\n— Met Office (@metoffice) January 3, 2025\nIn Wales, buses are replacing trains between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland, so motorists and pedestrians alike are warned to be wary of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, or cycle paths.\nOn Thursday, London councils activated an emergency accommodation protocol for people sleeping rough in freezing conditions.\nThe emergency measures, which see extra beds made available, have been active for three nights so far this winter.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down, with emergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts.\nThere have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.\nTemperatures expected to fall as low as minus 8C as week-long cold snap hits UK Canadian News Today.\ntemperatures expected to fall as low as minus 8c as week long cold snap hits uk\nPlease note that the original topic has been published and is available on canadian news today the editing team at PressBee have verified it and it may have been partially modified or quoted from it.
