  "text": "ECONOMY\nBlockades take their toll on industrial sector, too\nConcerns in the domestic industrial sector are growing, as farmers’ blockades on highways and at customs offices are leaving their mark on the supply chain.\nThe constant opening and closing of customs offices in Promachonas, on the Greek-Bulgarian border, as well as in Evzoni and Niki, on the border with North Macedonia, have caused turmoil.\nLarge business groups are now forced to seek alternative solutions for the timely supply of raw materials, turning to domestic suppliers or other foreign markets.\nFor a truck to go from Athens to Thessaloniki it now takes an extra 2.5 hours, meaning a sum of nine hours.",
