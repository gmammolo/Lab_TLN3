  "text": "Heatwave conditions were creeping back up from the south on Friday afternoon, as the mercury was set to rise well above the 30-degree marker over the weekend.\nTops of a scorching 39 degrees were expected on Sunday as a strong high-pressure system displaces the status quo in the Tasman.\nThe blistering heat had firefighters on alert across the country on Friday, as the hot, dry weather made it difficult to contain existing blazes.\nThe fire danger warning was expected to increase from Moderate on Friday to High over the weekend as the heat intensified. The state's Rural Fire Service says at a High danger rating, residents need to be ready to act in case of an emergency.\nThe chance of a shower over Newcastle, Maitland and Gosford on Friday afternoon lingered even as the cloud cover broke up and temperatures mingled in the high 20s and low 30s.\nA chance of fog and a possible thunderstorm in some parts in the early morning on Saturday looked set to burn off to a balmy 30-degree day.\nAn early grey start in Newcastle yielded to a warm and blustery afternoon that left conditions lumpy and poor in the surf as holiday beachgoers headed to the sand to cool off.\nThe surf conditions looked more optimistic into next week as models show a rapidly developing low from below Tasmania to the south-east that should result in a decent south swell up the Tasman to add to the local short-period swell.\n\"Bigger surf than recently is likely, although winds could be tricky with lots of onshore flow indicated,\" forecasters for Surfline say.\nWith AAP",
