  "text": "A major winter storm is expected to hit the Northern Kentucky region this weekend.\nSunday into Monday morning, according to the National Weathe r Service, a “potent storm system” will roll through with “significant precipitation,” which is said to have the potential for widespread hazardous weather.\nThe NWS Willmington outpost (which covers the NKY region) said that everyone in the Ohio Valley should be prepared for the storm’s impact regardless of location. However, models are currently predicting that the Cincinnati and NKY regions will have a “very high” chance of significant impact from the storm.\nAs of Thursday, the NWS said the track of the system is uncertain, and it is currently too early to pinpoint how strong the storm will be.\nA smaller amount of snow is also expected Thursday evening into Friday morning with the possibility of around a half inch of accumulation.\nThe NWS also shared some tips on how to best handle strong winter weather:\nWith a potentially significant winter storm on the horizon Sunday into Monday, it is a good time to review winter storm preparedness actions and terminology. #INwx pic.twitter.com/YetWE1PEIl\n— NWS Indianapolis (@NWSIndianapolis) January 1, 2025",
