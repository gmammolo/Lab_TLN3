  "text": "Representational image\nDelhi: More than 100 flights were delayed at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Friday morning as the national capital was engulfed in dense fog, resulting in low visibility, an airport official confirmed.\nThe thick fog that blanketed Delhi caused visibility to drop to near zero in several parts of the city, severely affecting air travel. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a minimum temperature of 7°C in the capital, while forecasting cloudy skies for the day.\nAt 8 am, the Palam weather station recorded zero visibility, while Safdarjung weather station reported visibility as low as just 50 metres. The dense fog led to significant delays in flight operations at Delhi's IGI Airport.\nImpact on flights\nThe airport, which handles around 1,300 flight movements daily, was operating all its runways under the Category-III Instrument Landing System (ILS), which allows planes to land even in low-visibility conditions. However, flights that are not CAT III compliant were particularly affected.\nAn official from Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) stated: \"While landing and takeoffs continue at Delhi Airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected. Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted.\"\nDespite the delays, no flights have been diverted as of yet.\nAir quality and health risks\nAlongside the fog, Delhi's air quality was classified as very poor, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 351 at 9 am. This level of pollution poses health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing health conditions. According to the AQI scale, a reading between 301 and 400 is considered \"very poor.\"\nThe humidity level at 8:30 am was recorded at 100 percent, adding to the already challenging conditions.\nForecast for the day\nThe IMD has predicted that the dense fog will persist throughout the day, with a maximum temperature of around 17°C. Commuters are advised to remain cautious and adhere to safety guidelines while travelling in these hazardous weather conditions.\nPassengers flying from Delhi Airport are encouraged to check with their airlines for the latest updates on their flight status due to the ongoing weather disruptions.\n(Agency inputs)",
