  "text": "Some drivers in Park City struggled in the recent snow, resulting in a series of slide-off accidents and other issues on the roads.\nThe Park City Police Department received the reports over several days in late December. The Park City area had suffered through a relatively dry spate of weather during the early winter before the snow late in the month.\nThe cases were reported in a variety of locations. Public police logs did not provide details in many of the cases, but the accidents did not appear to be serious. The troubles were especially apparent on the day after Christmas.\nSome of the reports:\nOn Thursday, Dec. 26, at 3:23 p.m., a vehicle reportedly slid in the area of Norfolk Avenue and 8th Street. The vehicle “pulled to the side, and is causing a hazard for other vehicles,” according to public police logs. On Dec. 26 at 4:48 p.m., a slide-off accident was reported in lower Deer Valley. The vehicle was “stuck,” the police were told. On Dec. 26 at 4:57 p.m., a slide-off accident was reported in the area of the intersection of Marsac Avenue and Hillside Avenue. A vehicle was apparently “all over the road,” according to the logs. On Dec. 26 at 5 p.m., a sedan reportedly left the road along Kearns Boulevard “and got stuck in the snow,” the police were told. The accident occurred in the westbound direction close to Park City High School. On Dec. 26 at 5:58 p.m., a slide-off accident was reported in the area of Norfolk Avenue and King Road. The police were told the vehicle “slid off an embankment and has already been hit by another car.” The person who contacted the police was “standing outside of the car right now and not feeling terribly safe,” according to department logs. On Dec. 26 at 6:46 p.m., a vehicle became “stuck on the side of the road” on Crescent Road. The vehicle was blocking the road “with a line of cars trying to come down from the resort,” the logs said. There were also several traffic accidents that did not result in injuries. It was not clear from the logs whether the accidents were blamed on the road conditions.",
