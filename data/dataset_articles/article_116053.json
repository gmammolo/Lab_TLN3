  "text": "Shafaqna India: Chandigarh is experiencing heavy fog, while the bitter cold continues to grip Haryana and Punjab, making the weather conditions challenging across the region. The dense fog has reduced visibility in several areas of Chandigarh, causing disruptions to daily activities. Meanwhile, the cold wave in Haryana and Punjab has led to a drop in temperatures, further intensifying the discomfort for residents.\nThe cold conditions have persisted for several days, with temperatures in some parts of the region plummeting to below normal levels. The ongoing chilly weather has also affected transportation, with delays reported in both road and rail services due to the low visibility caused by the fog.\nAs the cold wave continues, local authorities are advising residents to take precautions against the cold, including wearing warm clothing and limiting outdoor exposure. The forecast suggests that these cold conditions may persist for a few more days, keeping the region in the grip of winter’s harshest phase.",
