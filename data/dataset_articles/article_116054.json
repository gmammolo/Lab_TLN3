Forecasts suggest it may feel like 20 degrees outside by early Friday morning.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Code Blue is in effect until 8 a.m. Friday. Shelters and drop-in centers will be available city-wide for the homeless and those seeking shelter. No one will be denied shelter during a Code Blue.\nThe NYCDHS will deploy outreach teams to assist homeless individuals. If you encounter a homeless person in the cold, please call 311, and an outreach team will be sent to that location.\nMore information on homeless assistance can be found online or on the 311 app.\nBen Mitchell is a digital content producer from Vermont who has covered both local and international news since 2021.
