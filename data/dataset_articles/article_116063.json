  "text": "Due to the extreme cold wave, all schools in Noida for students from classes to 8 will remain closed starting from today until further notice. The District Magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar, Manish Kucmar Verma, has made this decision because of the severe cold weather conditions and fog in the area.\nThis closure includes all schools, whether they follow the state board, CBSE, or ICSE curriculum. Rahul Panwar, the district’s basic Education Officer, sent a letter to all school principals in Noida to inform them of the closure. According to the official notice, the closure is necessary due to the worsening situation of weather conditions and the problems students would face traveling through fog. On Thursday, the temperature in the region was between 8-27 degree celsius, according to the Indian Metrological Department.\nDecember 29, temperature dropped suddenly, and similar measures were taken in other districts like Meerut and Bagpat. Schools in Ghaziabad were also closed on December 30 due to heavy rainfall.\nWinter Vacation in UP and Other State\nMany schools in Uttar Pradesh have started their winter vacation and will remain closed until January 15. The Haryana Government has also announced a winter break for all schools from January 1 to January 15, 2025. Similarly, Delhi’s Directorate of Education has declared a winter break for all government schools starting January 1.\nJammu and Kashmir, schools in the winter zone of Jammu division are on winter holidays until February 28, with holidays starting from December 10, as announced by the Minister for School Education, Sakina Masood Itoo.",
