Several areas in Balochistan have also seen rainfall, with temperatures plummeting to minus 9 degrees Celsius in Skardu and minus 8 degrees Celsius in Layyah.\nDense fog in Punjab and Sindh has led to the closure of multiple motorways, creating travel difficulties for many.\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department forecasted dry weather to persist across Punjab, including Lahore, although a rain-bearing system is expected to enter Pakistan tomorrow.\nMost districts in Punjab, including Lahore, may see rain, with additional rainfall anticipated on January 5, likely intensifying the cold conditions.\nSevere fog is expected to continue during the mornings and evenings in Punjab, further hampering travel.
