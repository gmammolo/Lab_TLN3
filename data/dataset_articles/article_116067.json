  "text": "Unsettled weather returns to Western Washington as we close out the first weekend of the new year. Another disturbance will arrive overnight Thursday into Friday with more lowland rain and mountain snow on the way. Rainfall will again be generally light, but more widespread than on Thursday. Another disturbance will push rain in from the south overnight and into Friday. Drivers should be prepared for winter driving conditions through the passes and into Central and Eastern Washington. Snow levels will hover around 3500&apos; with chances for snow through the weekend. Area ski slopes and passes could pick up an additional foot by the end of the weekend. A winter weather advisory is in effect starting Friday morning through Saturday morning for the Washington Cascades. (FOX 13 Seattle) In addition to the rain and mountain snow, easterly Cascade gap winds will increase overnight into Friday. No advisory is posted, but winds may gust to near 45 mph at times in our foothill communities. Winds will be strongest in the western Cascade foothills Friday morning. (FOX 13 Seattle) While the first weekend of 2025 will start off a bit damp, drier weather is on the way. Sunbreaks and highs nearing 50 are forecast by early next week as many may be heading back to work and school after the extended holiday break. The next round of widespread rain will hit Western Washington Friday morning.
