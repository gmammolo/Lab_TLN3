( KREX ) — Colorado is known for its abundance of mountains, like the Grand Mesa in our backyard. However, with towering views and thick forests comes a more sinister possibility.\nColorado Avalanche Information Center Director Ethan Greene tells WesternSlopeNow there have been 456 avalanches throughout the state just within this past week.\nGreene states the Grand Mesa is sitting at an avalanche risk of about a level two out of a five-point scale. Places like the flat tops outside of Meeker are sitting at a level three.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Seventeen people were caught in 15 avalanches this season already, all of which have gotten lucky and made it out alive.\nHe says not to worry about the safety of your winter sports since the snowpack inside ski areas versus outside is quite different.\nIf you do plan to explore the backcountry, Greene suggests checking colorado.gov/avalanche to see current conditions.\nWhat should you carry through avalanche country? There are three main essentials – an avalanche rescue transceiver, a probe pole and a shovel.\nSalesperson at Gearhead Outfitters Mikayla Herrara showed WesternSlopeNow what an avalanche transceiver looks like. It’s a smaller device you wear on the outside of your body, like on a backpack strap. She says beacons can cost anywhere from $200 to $400.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Greene tells WesternSlopeNow avalanches form by weak layers of snow made by calm periods of weather. Once more snow falls on top, it creates a thick, heavy slab that can slide off of the weak layer.\nIf you plan to go out to explore the wonderful backyard Colorado has to offer, stay vigilant and bring these essentials. Avalanche season is far from over.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
