I then spent five months in a B&B.\"\nFlooding hit Loughborough a year ago after Storm Henk swept through [PA] Simel Kara said his mother, Shobhna Kara, 74, has been sofa surfing for the last 12 months after one metre of water entered her home in Rushey Mead during the storm.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"It was a typical evening, and the entire family was visiting when we received a flood warning,\" he said.\n\"The water was rising more and more, it was an apocalyptic scenario. We had to grab everybody and move them upstairs.\"\nMrs Kara, whose house backs on to Melton Brook, then lost her husband two weeks after the storm.\nHomes, roads and businesses were flooded after Storm Henk hit Leicestershire in January 2024 [BBC] \"It's been very upsetting and traumatic and we've not been able to grieve our father's loss,\" Mr Kara added.\n\"You relieve the experience over and over again. It's like a nightmare.\n\"Help has been very minimal. There is a grant available, that I have applied for. But the individual has to pay for the surveyor, and that costs around £800.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in World Passengers fearful of crash left in a panic after ‘terrifying’ Boeing 737-800 flight fails to take off — twice NY Post Flagship Ukrainian brigade trained in France goes AWOL The Telegraph Suspected Chinese underwater spy drone found by fishermen CBS News China’s 6th-gen stealth jet smashes radar evasion military standard, claims study Interesting Engineering \"Any further works are borne from the property owner, prior to the grant being issued. I feel like we have been forgotten.\"\nDr Nora Albaldawi was forced to move into a new premises on Welford Road [BBC] Dentist Dr Nora Albaldawi, who runs Skintique Beautiful Smiles, said she was treating a patient when the flood water came into the reception area of her premises in Victoria Park Road.\nShe said her team feared electrocution as they tiptoed out of the building and the flood water caused more than £50,000 worth of damage.\nDr Albaldawi has since decided to make a fresh start at another premises on Welford Road in Leicester.\nShe said: \"After the flood, I could not guarantee that this was not going to happen again. I looked for other places that I could move into,\" said the dentist, who has been practicing since 2001.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"I was treating a patient when my staff told me that I need to leave. I was tip-toeing out of the building and I was worried that I was going to be electrocuted.\n\"We were on the ground floor, so everything was destroyed. I put all my heart and soul into the original business.\n\"For me, to give up that, it was really heartbreaking I had to do it.\"\nThe storm left a trail of devastation in its wake [BBC] Advertisement Advertisement A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said protecting the public was their top priority.\n\"The Environment Agency is currently delivering the government's long-term funding programme of flood defences, investing over £1 billion this year to scale up national resilience through building new and improving existing flood defences,\" said a statement.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said their thoughts are with \"everyone affected by Storm Henk\".\n\"Protecting communities from flooding is an absolute priority for this Government,\" a statement said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement \"It's why we have committed £2.4 billion over the next two years to maintain, repair and build flood defences to protect communities across the country.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .
