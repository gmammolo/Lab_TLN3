(WMBD) — A strong winter storm is expected track across the country this weekend bringing accumulating snow from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast. A swath of moderate to heavy snow is expected to track through Central Illinois, potentially impacting some in our area, while freezing rain impacts far southern Illinois.\nKey Takeaways\nSnow begins early Sunday morning and continues through sunrise Monday\nHeaviest snow expected Sunday afternoon and evening\nHazardous travel expected south of I-80 Sunday afternoon and night\nDelays and impacts could persist through Monday morning, particularly along I-72\nWidespread accumulations over 4 inches likely, few pockets over 8 inches possible\nStorm Timeline There is still some uncertainty as to exactly when the snow will begin but we expect snow to start sometime Sunday morning between 3 am and 9 am. Snow will then expand northeastward impacting all areas south of I-80 by sunset. Periods of moderate to heavy snow will impact areas along and south of I-74 from mid-afternoon through midnight with snow gradually ending by sunrise Monday.\nSnowfall Forecast – First Call While confidence in the overall storm track has increased, subtle wobbles of 50-100 miles could have a significant impact on overall snow accumulations so these totals will likely need to be revised over the next few days.\nWidespread snow accumulations greater than 4 inches are expected south of a Macomb to Pontiac line while the best chances for exceeding 6 inches of snow are south of a Havana to Bloomington line. The Peoria area is expected to receive 3-7 inches of snow, though some northern neighborhoods could see less. There will be a sharp gradient in accumulations on the north side of the system where an influx of dry air should keep higher totals in check. That said 1 to 3 inches are possible along I-80 with 2-4 inches expected near Galesburg.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement A more detailed snowfall forecast, including an accumulation timeline will be available over the next few days.\nProbability of Snow Accumulations on Sunday\nAt Least 2″\nAt Least 4″\nAt Least 6″\nAt Least 8″\nPeoria\n77%\n55%\n31%\n20%\nBloomington\n85%\n72%\n54%\n37%\nGalesburg\n48%\n28%\n15%\n6%\nCanton\n79%\n58%\n29%\n20%\nPontiac\n65%\n42%\n28%\n18%\nWinter Storm Impacts Moderate to heavy snow will lead to hazardous travel conditions over Central Illinois while a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet, and snow bring icy conditions to the southern half of the state.\nThe Probabilistic Winter Storm Severity Index shows a 40-80% chance of moderate impacts along and south of I-74 with the greatest confidence in heavy snow along I-72. Moderate impacts are defined as the following:\nExpect disruptions to daily life.\nHazardous driving conditions.\nClosures and disruptions to infrastructure may occur.\nThe same index shows a 20-40% chance of Major impacts centered along I-72. Major impacts are defined as the following:\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Expect considerable disruptions to daily life.\nDangerous or impossible driving conditions.\nWidespread closures and disruptions to infrastructure may occur.\nThe National Weather Service has issued Winter Storm Watches for areas along and south of I-72 where there’s higher confidence in more impacts. Winter Storm Watches for far southern Illinois are for the combination of snow, sleet and freezing rain. Additional watches could be issued for areas along I-74 in the future, especially if we end up with a slight shift north in storm track.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Passengers kicked off flight with nowhere to go in travel nightmare: ‘People out on the streets like animals’ The Independent Historic ski resort announces immediate closure after battling decade of insurmountable conditions: 'Mother nature has not been kind to us' The Cool Down Pro-Ukraine special forces soldier shot himself before Cybertruck explosion The Telegraph New Orleans attacker discussed plans to kill his family and join ISIS in chilling recordings.

If you must travel make sure you have a winter prep kit that includes blankets, snacks, water, shovel, and a cell phone charger in your vehicle. It’s unclear how many closures and delays there will be by Monday but conditions should improve through Monday morning.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
