  "text": "WJW ODOT, state patrol warning drivers ahead of lake effect snow Jack Shea Fri, January 3, 2025 at 3:15 AM UTC 1 min read\nCUYAHOGA COUNTY, Ohio (WJW) — Areas of the snowbelt could soon see significant amounts of lake effect snow.\nAnd Ohio Department of Transportation crews are already gearing up for the storm, which is already prompting a warning from the state of Ohio.\nCurrent weather alerts\nThe highway patrol said that last winter, there were more than 8,000 accidents on snow-, ice- or slush-covered roads in the state. Of those, 15 were fatal accidents.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Investigators said many of those crashes could have been avoided if drivers had slowed down and left more distance between them and the cars and trucks ahead of them.\nWith lake effect snow warnings in effect and the possibility of heavy snow squalls into the weekend, ODOT is again asking drivers to be patient.\n“We just want to remind all motorists: slow down, drive per the conditions that you’re experiencing,” said Brent Kovacs, ODOT spokesperson. “If you get snow-covered roads, please slow down. Don’t expect to go the speed limit. You know, we do our best to keep the roads safe and passable, which means we expect you to go below the posted speed limit to do so.”\nSmall dog dies from heart attack induced by fireworks’ bang on New Year’s Eve\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement As the lake effect snow starts to move in, ODOT says there are 35 plow trucks assigned to the snow belt areas of Geauga and Ashtabula counties, and a total of 250 trucks will be working on ice and snow removal on highways across the entire region.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
