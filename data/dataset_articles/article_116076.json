  "text": "WEST MICHIGAN — Ahead of expected lake effect snow, the National Weather Service issued a Winter Weather Advisory for Friday, Jan. 3, 2025.\nThe advisory was scheduled from 4 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday for the following counties in West Michigan: Kalamazoo, Van Buren, Allegan, Barry, Ottawa, Kent, Muskegon, Newaygo and Oceana County.\nLake effect snow was expected to pick back up overnight through the start of Friday, continuing off and on through early Saturday morning.\nGenerally 1 to 4 inches of snow was forecast in the advisory area, but the strongest bands of lake effect may produce locally higher amounts in a few locations.\nThe greatest potential for some localized higher totals was across portions of Ottawa, Allegan, Van Buren and northwest Kalamazoo counties.\nWhile true white out conditions are not anticipated, at least some reduced visibility can be expected due to wind gusts 25 to 30 mph Friday afternoon and evening.\nHigh temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-20s Friday afternoon before falling into the upper teens through Saturday morning.\nColder than average temperatures settle in this weekend and are likely to dominate the forecast through at least mid-January.\nFollow meteorologist Will Haenni on Facebook, X & Instagram.
