  "text": "The Pakistan Meteorological Department has announced that a rain-bearing system will enter the country tomorrow, affecting several regions, including Lahore and much of Punjab.\nThe system is expected to bring showers, with an increased chance of rain in Lahore and surrounding areas on January 4, Express News reported.\nThe department also forecasted rain for most districts in Punjab, with Lahore likely to experience rainfall by January 5.\nThe arrival of this system is expected to increase the intensity of the cold weather, with temperatures dropping further.\nLahore's minimum temperature was recorded at 6°C, while the maximum is expected to reach around 15°C.\nThe weather pattern will also lead to severe fog in the region, particularly in the mornings and evenings.\nThis has resulted in challenges for travellers, with several motorways being closed due to poor visibility. The fog will likely continue for the next few days, making travel conditions hazardous.\nWith this weather change, residents of Lahore and other cities in Punjab are advised to prepare for colder temperatures and potential disruptions to daily activities due to the rain and fog.\nMoreover, the first snowfall of the new year in Gilgit-Baltistan and the upper Neelum Valley has [turned](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2519744/chilly-weather-in-gilgit-baltistan-after-snowfall) the weather more chilly in the region.\nHowever, the sky is clear in Murree and Galiyat despite an alert and forecast by PMD and the meteorological department respectively. The first snow fall of the winter season has exacerbated the travel woes of public.\nThe met office has forecast more snowfall and issued a travel advisory, asking local people and tourists to avoid travelling to the upper areas of G-B.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our [Comments FAQ](/comments-policy)",
