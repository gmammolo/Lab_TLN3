  "text": "Over 100 flights were delayed at Delhi airport on Friday morning due to adverse weather, with many others facing further scheduling disruptions. The dense fog in the national capital caused visibility to drop to zero. “Landing and takeoffs are ongoing at Delhi Airport; however, flights not equipped with CAT III capabilities might experience delays. Passengers are advised to check with their respective airlines for updated flight details. We regret any inconvenience caused,” Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) shared in a post on X at 6:35 am.\nThe CAT III system allows aircraft to operate in low-visibility conditions. The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), managed by DIAL, handles about 1,300 aircraft movements daily.\nIndiGo, SpiceJet issue advisory IndiGo and SpiceJet, both prominent low-cost carriers, also issued advisories on social media, warning passengers about potential weather-related delays. According to aviation tracking website FlightRadar24, as of 10:14 a.m., delays averaged around eight minutes for 20 flights.\nWinter weather can be fickle, and we assure you that our teams are working diligently to minimise the impact on your travel plans. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\n— IndiGo (@IndiGo6E) January 3, 2025\n#WeatherUpdate : Due to bad weather in Delhi (DEL), all departures/arrivals and their consequential flights might get affected. Passengers are requested to keep a check on their flight status via https://t.co/2wynECZugy .\n— SpiceJet (@flyspicejet) January 3, 2025\nA dense smog blanketed Delhi, triggering warnings from airport and airline officials about potential flight disruptions as deteriorating air quality reduced visibility to zero in some regions.\nDelhi, grappling with persistent smog and declining air quality since the onset of winter, was ranked the third most polluted capital globally in live rankings released by Swiss air quality monitoring group IQAir on Friday.\nWhat IMD said on Delhi weather The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted that the cold wave in Delhi will persist for the next few days. According to IMD, “dense to very dense fog” is expected to continue today and tomorrow, affecting visibility and weather conditions.\nThe minimum temperature in the capital is predicted to be around 8.5 degrees Celsius, with a maximum temperature of approximately 20 degrees Celsius. Additionally, light to moderate rainfall is anticipated in Delhi on January 6, providing some respite from the prevailing dry and foggy conditions.",
