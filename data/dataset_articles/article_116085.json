  "text": "By Minnesota Public Radio ,\n4 hours ago By Paul Huttner and Matt Alvarez, Minnesota Public Radio News\nHomeowner and auto insurance rates are rising fast in Minnesota.\nOne policy comparison site, Insurify, shows Minnesota’s auto insurance rates had the highest year-over-year increase in the nation.\nClimbing insurance rates have plagued Minnesotans in recent years, and one of the leading factors to the rise in premiums is extreme weather events.\n“More water vapor that’s in our air, that then turns into things that land on our house — whether it’s hail or rain — make bigger claims,” said Grace Arnold, who leads the Minnesota Department of Commerce.\n“The best thing is to be prepared. That means: Have conversations with your insurance agents. Really shop around. And make sure that you’re thinking about your preparation for when we do have these big storms that are as a result of climate change.”\nThe post Extreme weather events push up insurance rates for Minnesotans appeared first on Albert Lea Tribune .",
