More info\nJoin us on WhatsApp Brits are bracing for a 400-mile wide band of heavy snow to sweep across the UK on Saturday, with temperatures expected to plummet to -8C . The country is currently experiencing wintry conditions , with yellow weather warnings in place until Monday, and forecasts suggest the icy snap will continue into next week.\nWXCharts&apos; weekend maps indicate a low pressure system moving up and across the UK on Friday , initially bringing several centimetres of snow to southwest England and Wales before spreading across the Midlands and northern England. By 9pm, the snow band is predicted to stretch 402 miles, from Derry in Northern Ireland to Ipswich on the east coast of England.\nMore than five centimetres of snow could fall per hour, and although the band will break up, snowfall is expected to continue throughout the night and into Sunday for northern England. Temperatures could drop as low as -8C in Scotland on Saturday night, with only the far south of England expected to avoid freezing conditions.\nBBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes warned that the weekend \"may prove to be very disruptive for some\". He added: \"It&apos;s through Saturday night, into Sunday and into Monday that some areas could see some really severe weather due to heavy snow as this low pressure works into the cold air. In the cold air, we&apos;ll get snow right down to sea level.\"\nA Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice will be in effect from noon on Saturday until 9am on Monday, encompassing all English regions except the South West, most of Wales, and parts of southern Scotland. The Midlands, Wales, and northern England can expect around 5cm of snow, while up to 20-30cm may accumulate over higher terrain in Wales and the Pennines, according to the national agency, reports the Mirror .\nStrong winds are also expected, which could cause drifting snow in some places, and the risk of ice is increased by the possibility of freezing rain as temperatures rise slightly. Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan commented: \"At the moment we&apos;ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn&apos;t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it&apos;s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.\"\nIn addition, the UK Health Security Agency has set cold weather health alerts for all of England in anticipation of a chilly week ahead. Amber alerts, effective from 12pm on Thursday until January 8, indicate an increased likelihood of deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and above or with existing health conditions, the UKHSA warned.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
