  "text": "3 hours ago Heavy Snow, Ice, and Wind May Spread Into Indiana & Kentucky 01/02/25 4:07pm EST\n12Z EURO 01/02/25 for 0/05/2542pm EST Photo by Tropical Tidbits Good afternoon everyone. We continue to watch the pieces of the puzzle moving into place in order to give ourselves our first true powerful winter storm system of the season.\nThis looks to be a big one, and not for the \"typical\" spots such as the Northeast & New England. Our first major storm for the season, looks ot impact the Midwest, Central, Gulf, and Mid-Atlantic states between this weekend and Monday from west to east.\nOur first concern will be across parts of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, and Illinois as low pressure gets going and is energized by energy from the Gulf of Mexico. Very cold air rushing in behind it, plus cold low pressure keeping everything from progressing to the northeast, will help create a very long shield of frozen precipitation.\nWhere the air is cold enough, we'll see all snow and alot of it. By the time all is said and done, and we see where the heaviest snow band sets up, we could be dealing with 1-2ft of snow; plus winds in excess of 45-50mph in spots. This in turn, could also set the parameters for blizzard warnings in the final phase of dealing out watches and warnings across the region.\nAnother major hazard will be the freezing rain and sleet involved where overunning of warm air takes place, but stubborn cold air remains locked at the surface. Heavy freezing rain and sleet may occur as onset precipitation across parts of Kansas and Missouri before changing over to all snow, but we could also see a more prolonged period of icing across parts of east/central Missouri, lower Illinois, and lower Indiana.\nThis will also change to all snow, then eventually spread into Kenutcky, then Virginia and into Maryland and Delaware. We could also see some light to moderate snow in southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey; as well as some light snow and flurries possible across New York City and Long Island on Monday.\nThe final phase of this is the warm quadrant of our system, where severe weather is likely across parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Look for a defined, fast-moving line to form Sunday afternoon, then race across the south and eventually into Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.\nBack in Texas, Arkansas, and the Gulf States, look for powerful thunderstorms capable of damaging winds in excess of 60mph, large hail, frequent lightning, torrential rain, and an elevated risk of tornadoes. Be prepared to take action in order to save property and/or life.\nNational Weather Service - Winter Storm Warning Till Sunday Evening - Topeka, KS\nSevere Weather Risk Blizzard Freezing Rain Winter Travel Hazards Weather Forecast Accuracy 57",
