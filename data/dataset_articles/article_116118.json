  "text": "The first weekend of 2025 is here and it will get off to a cold start.\nA strong cold front will push through on Friday morning bringing some very gusty winds behind it. Winds will gust at 25-35MPH out of the northwest through the day. Highs will only reach the mid/upper-40s with feel like temps in the 30s through most of the day.\nSaturday will remain breezy with winds gusting around 10-20MPH early dropping off gradually through the day. The heart of this cold snap will be overhead with highs in the mountains remaining in the 30s and low/mid-40s for the lower elevations.\nThings will get interesting very briefly on Sunday with some light sleet or freezing rain possible just as the precipitation moves in ahead of our next rain maker, but it will change over quickly to just cold rain. Rain will remain likely through the day Sunday and especially overnight. Total rainfall Sunday into Monday of 1-2″ is likely. Fortunately, no severe weather or flooding concerns exist right now but stay tuned in case that changes.\nHave a great weekend!",
