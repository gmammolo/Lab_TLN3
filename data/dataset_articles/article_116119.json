  "text": "An Arctic airmass bringing snow, ice and bitterly cold conditions is on the way to Ireland next week, potentially leading to school closures, as concerns are being raised about the elderly and the homeless. Temperatures are set to plunge to as low as -10C next week, prompting warnings for road users and farmers, while a leading homeless campaigner has said it could be a ‘life-or-death situation’ for those sleeping rough.\nRELATED: Six tips for a healthy pregnancy this winter\nIn its forecast for next week, Met Éireann warned of ‘treacherous conditions with some significant accumulations of lying snow, along with widespread severe frost and ice’.\nIt issued a yellow cold weather warning for last night, with -3C due in places after darkness fell. While snow is expected over the weekend, the coldest of the weather will come early next week, with temperatures set to plummet as low as -10C on Tuesday night, along with dense freezing fog.\nA meeting will take place between Met Éireann and Local Authority Severe Weather Assessment Teams on Friday to discuss the impact of the Arctic blast.\nCEO of older persons charity Alone, Seán Moynihan, told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘The cold weather snap is a public health issue for older people so they need to make smart choices… Even if you’re short on money, our message would be to prioritise heating, medication and food.\n‘If you’re worried about the potential of increased costs that’s an issue for another day.’\nAubrey McCarthy, co-founder of homeless and addiction charity Tiglin, warned: ‘People who can’t get accommodation, or are sleeping rough because they have other difficulties, will face dire conditions.\n‘They are extremely vulnerable and are at risk. We know we are giving out hot stews, socks, hats and scarves, but as temperatures plummet the people coming to us are not just fighting the cold, they are fighting for survival. This is a life-or-death situation.’\nGary Gannon, education spokesman for the Social Democrats, said that the country is consistently ‘unprepared for cold weather, despite temperatures plummeting every year’. He urged the Government to ‘act now’ to ensure ‘vital’ services such as schools can remain open in a safe manner.\n‘The Government needs to ensure that local authorities are adequately prepared and resourced for freezing temperatures,’ he said.\nSinn Féin’s education spokeswoman Sorca Clarke TD, said that special attention must be paid to access roads to schools in small towns, ‘as many will be untreated, and potentially dangerous’ in the days ahead.\nMs Clarke also called on the Department to make additional funding available for schools that do not have functioning heating systems.\nA Department of Education spokesperson said ‘there is a possibility that some schools will choose to close’, but those decisions were down to the management of individual schools, and would be based on child safety.\n‘Areas for consideration include maintenance of premises and utilities, salting and gritting and transport to and from school and having regard to local conditions,’ he said.\nMet Éireann said this weekend will be very cold, with ‘very disruptive and impactful’ weather likely in the days ahead, with the possibility of heavy rain, sleet and snow.\nThe snow is set to begin on Saturday night, away from the south and southwest. Sunday will bring further falls of rain, sleet and some further significant snowfall accumulations for a time.\nIt will gradually become drier from the west later in the day as the area of low pressure moves away eastwards.\nMembers of the public who are concerned about anyone sleeping rough can contact the Dublin Region Homeless Executive via its website, call 01 872 0185 or use its free app Dublin City Rough Sleeper Alerts.\nAlone can be contacted via its national support line on 0818222024.\nShare your thoughts on this story or any other over on our discussion boards .",
