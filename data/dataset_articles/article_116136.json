  "text": "Millions of Australians will be affected by a scorching heatwave sweeping across the country’s southeast as firefighters battle to contain major fires.\nA blast of warm air caused by northerly winds that will become a trough of low pressure will force temperatures to soar across Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory over the weekend.\nParts of southern Australia will reach a sweltering 40C and the extreme heat is forecast to last until Monday, according to Weatherzone.\nTemperatures will reach 43C in Coober Pedy, while residents in Roxby Downs and Port Augusta will also swelter in temperatures of 41C and 42C on Saturday.\nThe mercury will reach 36C in Adelaide on Saturday, while temperatures of 33C are forecast for Sunday.\nNorthern and southern parts of Victoria are also likely to see temperatures close to 40C due to the hot air mass that will hit the state over the weekend.\nMildura, in the state’s far northwest, will soar to 41C on Saturday, while Bendigo residents will experience temperatures of 38C.\nMelbourne will also be hit by temperatures of 38C on Saturday before the temperature drops slightly to a high of 37C on Sunday before a cold turn next week.\nA blast of hot air caused by northerly winds that will become a trough of low pressure will force temperatures to soar in southeastern parts of the country (weather map pictured)\nThe heatwave will also affect areas near the Grampian region in the west of the state.\nExasperated firefighters continue to battle the massive fire that has devastated around 76,000 hectares of land in the Grampians National Park.\nThe fire, which has been burning for several weeks, has affected 40 percent of the national park or about the size of Singapore.\n“This is the fifth fire in 20 years, and the third major fire in that park, so the ongoing impact on some of the species is starting to be felt now,” Victoria State Control spokeswoman Reegan Key said.\n“So we’ve sent planes and crews burning towards the fire… we’ve also had some deliveries (of food) for the rock kangaroos.”\nLocals were urged to monitor conditions and authorities urged visitors to stay away from the Grampians National Park, which will remain closed until further notice.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe heatwave warning for several areas including the North East, East Gippsland and the Northern and Central Districts until Monday.\nExasperated firefighters continue to battle the massive fire that has devastated around 76,000 hectares of land in the Grampians National Park (pictured).\nThere are also more than 10 fires in Western Australia, but by Friday afternoon all had been downgraded to recommended levels.\nThe heatwave will also affect New South Wales and the Northern Territory.\nTemperatures in Tibbooburra, in far north-west New South Wales, and the inland town of Broken Hill, in western New South Wales, will reach 40C on Saturday.\nSydney will reach high temperatures of 29C on Saturday before the mercury rises to 31C on Sunday.\nTemperatures will remain in the low to mid-30s in Darwin next week with highs of 33C predicted for the weekend.\nBureau of Meteorology meteorologist Johnathan How said weather conditions were not expected to improve until Monday.\nSydney will reach high temperatures of 29C on Saturday before the mercury rises to 31C on Sunday.\n“Low intensity heatwaves are common at this time of year, but once we get into the severe category, especially with hot days and warm nights, some people can find it quite challenging,” Mr How said.\nbrisbane\nSaturday: Possible shower.
