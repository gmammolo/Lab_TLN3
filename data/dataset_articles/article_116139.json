  "text": "Sport PressBee .. The Sun Watch the post from Week-long freeze hits Britain TODAY with -8C plunge, up to 16 INCHES of snow & health alerts issued for WHOLE of England, Now to the details\nA WEEK-LONG freeze will hit Britain today – bringing an -8C cold plunge and up to 16 inches of snow.\nPublic health bosses have issued amber alerts for the whole of England from now until January 8.\nThe UK Health Security Agency warned a rise in deaths is likely, particularly among the elderly and people with health problems.\nLast night the mercury sank as low as minus 8C in rural Scotland and northern England.\nA yellow warning for snow will be in force from noon tomorrow until 9am on Monday.\nThe warning covers all regions of England, other than the south west, most of Wales and parts of southern Scotland.\nAround 2 inches of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England.\nA whopping 16 inches could fall over high ground in Wales and the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nStrong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.\nMet Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday.\n“But it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.”\nThe Met Office has warned people to be prepared and aware when travelling with longer journey times likely.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across the UK are impacted.\nPoor weather is currently affecting National Rail’s Northern and ScotRail services.\nIn Wales, buses are replacing trains between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThere could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north west of England and Northern Ireland.\nMotorists and pedestrians alike are warned to be wary of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, or cycle paths.\nYesterday London councils activated an emergency accommodation protocol for people sleeping rough in freezing conditions.\nThe emergency measures, which see extra beds made available, have been active for three nights so far this winter.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down.\nEmergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts and there have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.\nICE ICE MAYBE\nConditions should become a little warmer over the weekend before cold snap sets in again early next week.\nMet Office expert Dan Stroud said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles.\n“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week – but there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”\nNHS bosses in the West Midlands have warned locals not to go out early in the morning or late at night, when frost will be thick.\nThey said people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.\nHerefordshire residents have been urged to stock up on food and medicine and to seal up draughts in their homes.\nOAP STRUGGLE\nAge UK chief Caroline Abrahams said pensioners will struggle in the cold snap after the government slashed the winter fuel allowance.\nMs Abrahams said OAPs had already contacted the charity “worrying about what to do when this moment arrived”.\nShe said said: “We urge older people to do everything they can to stay warm.\n“Even if that means risking spending more on their heating than they feel they can afford.\n“The energy companies are under an obligation to help if you are struggling.”\nAbrahams added: “There may be support available from your local council too.”\nFrom this winter, only people on pension credit or certain other benefits will receive the winter fuel payments.\nMore than nine million others are set to be stripped of the allowance under the new rules.\nThis weekend's Met Office forecast in full\nToday\nIt will remain cold but mostly dry and sunny for many. Snow showers will continue to affect coasts exposed to the northerly wind.\nBut these will be more of a wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow in the west.\nTonight\nShowers in the north and west, these wintry over the hills will move eastwards.\nElsewhere with clear spells, temperatures will drop below freezing with a widespread frost developing for many.\nSaturday\nA cold and frosty for many, however thicker cloud will spread in from the southwest during the afternoon.\nA mixture of rain, sleet and snow pushing northwards overnight.\nSunday to Tuesday\nRain, sleet and snow continuing to spread northeast on Sunday, turning briefly milder in the south.\nColder but drier again on Monday with wintry showers, similar on Tuesday.\nweek long freeze hits britain today with 8c plunge up to 16 inches of snow\nPlease note that the original topic has been published and is available on The Sun the editing team at PressBee have verified it and it may have been partially modified or quoted from it.
