  "text": "Meteorological Department has forecasted a further drop in temperatures in Karachi, with the mercury potentially dipping into single digits once again.\nAccording to Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfraz, Karachi is currently experiencing cold and dry weather, with reduced intensity due to a change in wind direction.\nThe minimum temperature is expected to hover around 13°C, while the maximum may reach 27°C.\nFrom tomorrow, the cold intensity is predicted to rise again, with icy winds from Quetta sweeping through the city.\nResidents are advised to prepare for a significant drop in temperature and take necessary precautions as the chill intensifies.",
