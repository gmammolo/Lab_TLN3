  "text": "North West bracing for SNOW - just days after severe floods\nThe Met Office says temperatures could fall as low as -8C\nLiverpool and the north west is bracing for freezing temperatures and possible snow after torrential rain led to severe floods.\nThe clean-up is continuing in the worst hit areas, including Warrington, Ormskirk and parts of Cheshire.\nTemperatures are expected to fall as low as minus 8C overnight as a week-long spell of wintry conditions hits the UK.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued cold weather health alerts for all of England ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts have been issued from 12pm on Thursday until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely, the UKHSA said.\nDan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"There'll be widespread frost across the country (overnight), from Land's End to John O'Groats.\n\"It will be comfortably below where we should be for this time of year and I would expect temperatures to hit minus 8C in parts of Scotland.\"\nMr Stroud confirmed conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nHe said: \"The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles.\n\"But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n\"They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there's a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.\"\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down, with emergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts.\nThere have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.\nFirst for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Rayo app.",
