  "text": "Yesterday's thunderstorms created the perfect conditions for bushfire activity in what was already a hot, dry and windy day.\nA west coast trough formed on January 1, which developed into a dry thunderstorm over the Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions yesterday.\nHot temperatures in the low 40 degrees Celsius caused much of the rainfall to evaporate before it reached the gauges and many towns recorded 10 milimetres or less.\nBeverley recorded 24mm of rainfall yesterday, while Narrogin Aero received 22mm, and Wagin Aero picked up 15mm.\nThe trough is currently sitting over the Goldfields and Esperance regions, and will continue to move east, easing fire conditions.\nAnother west coast trough is expected to form early next week, bringing an increased chance of a thunderstorm by Monday or Tuesday afternoon.\nShire of Wongan-Ballidu chief bushfire control officer, Ross Lane, said brigades responded to three bushfires on Wednesday evening at east Kondut, north east of Wongan Hills and at Manmanning.\nThe fires were burning through paddocks of stubble and, Mr Lane said they were relatively easy to manage with fire breaks.\n\"The biggest one was about 160-170 hectares, we've had a fair bit bigger than that (in the past),\" Mr Lane said.\n\"It cleaned up pretty well and there wasn't much bush involved.\"\nHumidity and cloud cover made the job a lot easier to take care of, and eventually the wind dropped off.\n\"It's like chalk and cheese, if you've got 12 per cent humidity or 25pc,\" he said.\n\"I don't complain when there's humidity.\"\nOn the same day, volunteers from Beverley responded to two incidents on private properties, one involving a vehicle.\nAbout 40 hectares were burnt at each property, with little property damage.\n\"We managed to save one house that was very close,\" Shire of Beverley chief bushfire control officer, Bill Cleland said\nOne of the fires was near a pine plantation, which took longer to control.\n\"The first fire got 15-18mm of rainfall on it, but the second fire was probably seven kilometres west of that and got none,\" Mr Cleland said.\n\"The rain probably helped with making the first one safe and preventing other lightning strike fires.\"\nMr Cleland said the level of community support was phenomenal, with more than 40 volunteers showing up to assist in controlling the fire and the clean up.\n\"It was a full day yesterday (of clean up), it's a big community effort when we have these sorts of events.\"\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\nWe care about the protection of your data.
