  "text": "Weather Service: Severe Storm Threat Likely For Louisiana Sunday\nA quick check of the National Weather Service radar out of Lake Charles, Louisiana, this morning revealed a widely scattered but fairly steady stream of mainly light showers. The rain is falling in the general area south of US 190, between Eunice and Crowley, and between Opelousas and Lafayette. Heavier showers are also indicated in southern Vermilion Parish and just offshore.\nForecasters believe the light shower activity should move out of the area later this morning and by Friday afternoon almost all of Louisiana should experience a mix of clouds and sun and temperatures in the upper 60s. That will begin to change during the day on Saturday as another storm system approaches. However, the biggest impact from that storm system won't likely be felt until Sunday afternoon from Lake Charles to Lafayette and then points eastward.\nThe Storm Prediction Center has placed a large portion of Louisiana at risk for severe storms on Sunday. The area of concern is the entire state with the exception of a small sliver of southern and southeastern Louisiana. Lake Charles is included in the \"risk\" zone but Lafayette is just on the outside.\nThat certainly doesn't mean Lafayette, Baton Rouge, or New Orleans won't see strong or even severe weather on Sunday. The forecast graphic merely suggests the greatest potential for more and more frequent strong storms will be generally north of I-10.\nThe National Weather Service Forecast Office in Lake Charles has noted that Sunday afternoon will be the most likely time for strong and severe storms. The threats that could be produced by those storms included large hail, damaging winds, and the possibility of tornadoes. It is possible severe weather watches and warnings could be posted for the area during the day on Sunday.\nOnce the storm system moves through the area Sunday night we can expect much colder temperatures across the region. Forecast lows early Monday morning are expected to be just above the freezing mark. Overnight low temperatures on Tuesday are expected to drop below freezing along and south of I-10. So now might be the time to start thinking of protecting your plants from frost on both Monday and Tuesday.\nTemperatures should stay below normal for much of the next work week.",
