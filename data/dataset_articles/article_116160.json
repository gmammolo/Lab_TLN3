  "text": "North India is staring at a challenging winter, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting below-normal rainfall for the January to March 2025 period. For a region where winter precipitation is vital for agriculture and water resource management, this outlook raises significant concerns.\nEncompassing key states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh, the region typically receives 18% of its annual rainfall during this time, with Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh relying on it for nearly a third of their annual precipitation.\nThe IMD predicts that North India’s rainfall during January to March will fall below 86% of the Long Period Average (LPA), which stands at 184.3 mm based on data from 1971-2020. While January may see above-normal rainfall in some areas, the overall seasonal deficit could significantly impact the region's agriculture and water supply.\nImpact on agriculture\nWinter rainfall, largely influenced by western disturbances, is crucial for the Rabi crop season. Key crops like wheat, gram, peas and barley rely on timely and adequate precipitation for healthy growth. A deficit in rainfall can lead to reduced soil moisture, affecting germination and yield. Farmers in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh may face challenges in maintaining crop productivity, potentially leading to economic stress in these predominantly agrarian regions.\nWith water tables already under pressure due to overextraction, the reduced rainfall could exacerbate irrigation challenges. Farmers may need to resort to alternative water sources, increasing dependence on groundwater and raising concerns about sustainability.\nAdditionally, IMD’s forecast of above-normal minimum temperatures during January may affect cold wave patterns, which are critical for certain crop growth stages. Conversely, above-normal cold wave days in western and northern parts of central India could disrupt farming and livestock activities.\nWater resource management at risk\nBeyond agriculture, the projected rainfall deficit poses risks to water resource management. Winter precipitation replenishes reservoirs and supports the hydrological cycle in North India. A shortfall could affect drinking water availability, hydroelectric power generation, and industrial water needs. For regions like Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir, where winter snowfall contributes to glacial reserves, reduced precipitation may have long-term implications for summer water flows in major rivers.\nAs North India braces for a potentially drier winter, balancing immediate needs with long-term sustainability remains a pressing challenge.\n**\nFor weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).
