  "text": "Three flood warnings are still in place for York today, although river levels have started to fall.\nIt comes as a yellow weather warning for snow covering much of England including North Yorkshire comes into force from midday tomorrow till 11.59pm on Sunday.\nIn York, Rowntree Park is closed, although the café remains open.\nSt George’s Field and Esplanade car parks are also shut.\nThese are the flood warnings in place this morning:\nThe river level in York peaked at 3.91m at 6.30pm yesterday (Thursday). It is now forecast to drop sharply throughout today.\nThere are also six flood alerts for North Yorkshire:\nTemperatures in York dropped to -4°C last night, and went as low as -7°C in rural North Yorkshire.\nAccording to AccuWeather’s forecast for York tomorrow: “Snow between late on Saturday night and Sunday morning will accumulate 3-6 cm before changing to rain.”\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, is likely, the UKHSA said.\nDan Stroud, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said conditions should become warmer by the end of this weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nHe said: “The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles (for temperature figures).\n“But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n“They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.”",
