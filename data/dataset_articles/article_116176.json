  "text": "Cold and breezy weather takes us into the weekend\nAfter a mild and rainy end to 2024, we are kicking off ’25 with a cold pattern.\nA *Wind Advisory* remains in effect through early tonight for blustery conditions, with a few wind gusts 40-50 mph.\n*Gale Warnings* are in effect for our local waterways as well, through Friday morning.\nFriday and the weekend will be mostly sunny, but with cold and breezy conditions persisting.\nOn Monday, a winter storm will pass south of our area. Outside of some flurries or light snow, this looks like it will just miss us. The Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley could pick up 6-12″!\nOutside of that storm, I do not see much active weather over the next week plus. But the cold likely remains through mid-January, so I think there will still be opportunities for snow beyond that.",
