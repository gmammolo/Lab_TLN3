  "text": "Michigan Bracing for Severe Winter Weather\nMichigan enjoyed a very mild Christmas, so if you’re someone who doesn’t like the brutally cold temperatures, then you probably loved the warm weather over the holidays. But, Michigan is gearing up for severe winter weather. Just a few days ago, it almost felt like spring in some areas of lower Michigan, with light rain and dew taking the place of snow and ice. One good thing about the mild weather is that the roads were good for most of the holiday, so if you had to travel, you didn’t have to fend with ice and snow. But, now, there’s a change for the next two weeks, and here’s what you can expect.\nWinter Storm Brewing Across the U.S.\nThirteen states are in the path of what looks to be a dangerous winter storm arriving this week. The winter storm is expected to bring snow and ice from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic later this week. We’re talking “heavy snow and significant icing.”\nThe National Weather Service Prediction Center sent out a post on X on Thursday, January 2, showing a map of the impacted areas of the country. The storm is a bit more south than many winter storms, but even the areas that don’t get snow or ice are expected to get very cold temperatures.\nAccording to the NWS, the most likely impacted areas include parts of Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, Maryland and Kansas. Other areas of the country with a good chance of impacts include parts of New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, Iowa, West Virginia and Kentucky.\nAs for Michigan’s winter weather, the mild weather will leave us, at least for a few weeks. Temperatures are expected to be brutally cold for the next 10 days, with both highs and lows in the 20s for the rest of this week and going into the weekend. Next week, by Wednesday, January 8, many parts of Michigan will get down to the teens, according to the Weather Channel. Those teens are on the forecast through at least the middle of January, so get your earmuffs on. I’m not a fan of the cold weather or now, so bring on spring, please. Both Thanksgiving and Christmas didn’t have the worst weather for Michigan, so hopefully we’ll get lucky.\nWhile Michigan is expected to be north of the major U.S. storm, some areas are still projected to get some lake effect snow this week, according to the National Weather Service, including Cadillac, Big Rapids, Muskegon, Kalamazoo and some areas of the U.P.
