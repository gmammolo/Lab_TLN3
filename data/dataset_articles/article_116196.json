Getty\nHeat star Michael Neser, who was slated to return from injury for his first game of the campaign, described the rain delay as \"frustrating\" during an interview with Fox Cricket.\n\"Just when you think it's clearing … it starts to build up,\" the all-rounder said.\nLast year's grand finalists have already faced off once prior in BBL|14 and it was the Sixers who earned a modicum of revenge, securing a cruisy eight-wicket victory.\nAfter the washout, the Heat sit in fifth spot on the ladder, while the Sixers are atop the Big Bash standings with four wins from six games.\nThe other game on Friday night is scheduled for Perth's Optus Stadium between the Scorchers and Sydney Thunder, with both sides desperate to move to first place.\nCricket Big Bash Sydney Sixers Brisbane Heat Most viewed in Cricket\n'Pull the plug': Indian great weighs in after bizarre axing",
