Highs of 2 to 5 degrees in mostly light to moderate westerly or variable breezes, the winds fresher for a time in coastal parts of the north and northeast.\nStaying cold tonight with a mix of clear spells and scattered showers, the odd wintry one. Lowest temperatures of -2 to +1 degrees, locally colder where fog patches and freezing fog develop.
