THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck VANCOUVER — Vancouver lived up to its soggy reputation last year, with Environment Canada data showing 2024 was the city's wettest year so far this century.\nMeteorologist Chris Doyle says more than 1,367 millimetres of precipitation was recorded at Vancouver International Airport last year.\nThe drenching was boosted by a series of atmospheric river events and other storms, and represents the highest annual precipitation for Vancouver since 1999, when 1,394 millimetres fell.\nDoyle says a key reason for the heavy rainfall last year was an \"enhanced East Asian jet stream\" across the Pacific Ocean that persisted for weeks.\nVancouver averages 1,189 millimetres of precipitation each year, including both rain and snowfall converted to liquid water amounts.\nDoyle says the wettest year in recent records for Vancouver was 1997, when 1,521 millimetres fell at the airport station.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 3, 2025.\nChuck Chiang, The Canadian Press\nThis has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message",
