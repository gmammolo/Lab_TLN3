  "text": "A heavy fog has settled over North India, cutting visibility sharply and causing major disruptions to air and train services. At Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, over 200 flights are on hold due to the thick fog that has brought visibility down to nearly nothing. Kumar Utkarsh Updated: Jan 03, 2025 2:12 PM IST\nA thick layer of fog has settled over parts of North India, causing major visibility issues and disrupting air and train travel. Reports indicate that more than 200 flights have faced delays at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport as visibility dropped to almost nothing. This poor weather not only affects travel plans but also raises alarm over the region's air quality.\n1. Impact on Flight Operations The heavy fog is causing considerable delays in flight operations, with airlines like SpiceJet, Indigo, and Air India feeling the brunt of the disruptions. According to FlightRadar24, arriving flights are averaging a six-minute delay, while departures are lagging behind by about 47 minutes. Travelers are urged to verify their flight schedules before heading to the airport, as more cancellations could occur if visibility does not improve.\n2. Train Services Affected Train travel is also suffering due to the fog. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has reported that visibility has plummeted, heavily impacting train services across the region. Passengers should stay informed about their train schedules and any possible delays caused by these ongoing weather conditions.\n3. Weather Forecast and Temperature Trends Data from the IMD shows that Delhi reached a maximum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius, which is three degrees below the average, with a recorded minimum temperature of 7.6 degrees Celsius. The forecast suggests that the dense fog will linger until January 8, with light rain anticipated on January 6. On Friday morning, the temperature was around 9.6 degrees Celsius, marking the fifth straight day of cold weather in the National Capital.\n4. Visibility Reports from Airports Visibility reports from Delhi's airports illustrate the gravity of the situation. By 8 am, Palam Airport showed zero visibility, while Safdarjung Airport was only able to report 50 meters. It's worth noting that neither of these airports primarily handles commercial flights, further complicating matters.\n5. Air Quality Concerns The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has indicated that the Air Quality Index (AQI) at the Lodhi Road station stands at 309, putting it in the 'Very Poor' category. Such high levels of air pollution can pose health risks to both residents and travelers, underscoring the need for individuals to take precautions when going outside.\n6. Recommendations for Travelers With the ongoing disruptions, airlines have put out travel advisories, especially for affected routes like Delhi, Amritsar, Lucknow, Bengaluru, and Guwahati. Travelers are advised to keep an eye on updates for their flights and train services. Airlines are also recommending that passengers plan their trips with care, considering the likelihood of cancellations and delays.\nConclusion The dense fog over North India is creating a tough situation for air and train travelers, resulting in significant delays and disruptions. As weather conditions are expected to continue in this manner, both travelers and officials need to stay informed and ready for the ongoing challenges brought by the fog. Keeping an eye on weather updates and air quality reports will be crucial for ensuring safe travel in the coming days.\nDelhi coldwave delhi fog Delhi weather flight delay in delhi train services Trending Videos Shimla Ice Skating Rink is Open For You!
