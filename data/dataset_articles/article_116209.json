  "text": "By Eliza Noe, The Virginian-Pilot ,\n7 hours ago Snow accumulates along the top of a fence the morning of Jan. 29, 2022 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Hampton Roads is expected to get 2 to 4 inches of snow from a winter storm moving up the coast. L. Todd Spencer/The Virginian-Pilot/TNS Bitter cold temperatures are making their way to Hampton Roads, bringing the potential for wintery precipitation.\nJeff Orrock, meteorologist-in-charge at the National Weather Service in Wakefield, said a cold front is moving into the area in the coming days, and people should be aware of the potential effects on travel.\n“One of the things we’re going to be a little more concerned about is the fact that Friday night and Saturday morning does get pretty cold, and temperatures do get down into the mid 20s,” Orrock said. “So any surfaces that are wet, especially Saturday morning, are probably going to try to flash freeze on us a little bit. It could be kind of icy Saturday morning, if they don’t dry out fast enough, so that’s probably one of the things we’re going to have to watch out for.”\nAs the weekend progresses, Orrock said the chances for snow or freezing rain increase. Sunday night and the early hours of Monday will have the highest chances for winter weather. Current estimates show that there is between 5% and 20% chance that Hampton Roads will have “minor impacts” on driving conditions caused by winter weather. Areas toward Richmond and Northern Virginia will have stronger impacts and higher chances for snow accumulation.\n“Behind this weather system, it does get bitterly cold, and it’s going to stay cold for a while, probably even into next weekend,” Orrock said. “That’s something to keep in mind as we get through this. If we do see some areas that pick up, let’s say anywhere from 4-6 inches of snow, especially north of Richmond, it may be around for a while. Every night it’s going to be refreezing, and it might be tough to get rid of this stuff.”\nIt is still too early to make accurate snow total estimates, Orrock said, but over the next couple of days, it will be more clear as to what cities will get measurable snow.\nEliza Noe, eliza.noe@virginiamedia.com\nFor more stories, Subscribe to Virginian-Pilot.\n©2025 The Virginian-Pilot.
