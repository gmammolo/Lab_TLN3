Thirteen districts in the country are currently experiencing a cold wave, but the Bangladesh Meteorological Department says that the chill will ease a bit over the next few days as the temperature rises.\nMeteorologist Shahnaz Sultana said, “It is not possible to say whether the cold wave will ease, but the temperature will increase slightly. As a result, the cold will decrease for a few days,” as per a bdnews24.com report.\nThe Met office’s regular bulletin on Friday said that a mild cold wave is blowing over the Rajshahi, Pabna, Bogura, Naogaon, and Kushtia districts and the Rangpur Division.\nThe BMD forecast says that the temperature will increase over the 24 hours from 9:00 am on Friday.\nThe lowest temperature in the country on that day was recorded at 8.3 Degrees Celsius, recorded in Panchagarh’s Tentulia.\nThe Met Office’s long-term forecast for January says that the country may see one to three mild to moderate cold waves and one to two severe cold waves in the month.\nNight temperatures across the country may increase slightly and the day temperatures in the western part of the country may increase by 1.0 to 3.0 Degrees Celsius. Apart from this, the temperatures in other parts of the country are likely to remain unchanged.\nDue to dense fog, it may feel chillier in some places across the country during the day.\nThe weather forecast says that moderate to dense fog may fall across the country from midnight to the morning and may persist in some places until noon.\nDue to dense fog, air traffic, inland river transport and road communication may be temporarily disrupted.\nShare this news\nMore News\nJob Opportunities",
