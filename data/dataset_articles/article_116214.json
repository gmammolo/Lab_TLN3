  "text": "On Friday at 4:14 a.m. EST the National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in effect until Saturday at 4 a.m. EST for Antrim County.\nThe weather service adds to anticipate, \"Additional snow accumulations between 5 and 9 inches. Locally higher amounts possible. Lesser amounts of 2 to 6 inches across the western half of the county.\"\n\"High snowfall rates and gusty winds will lead to rapid drops in visibility, quick accumulation of snow on roads, and hazardous travel. The hazardous conditions could impact the Friday morning and evening commutes. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph,\" describes the weather service. \"If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency.\"\nStaying safe on winter roads: Winter driving tips from the weather service\nWinter's icy grip often turns roads treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and more than 480,000 injuries each year. When you find yourself on snowy or freezing rain-slicked roads, your top priority should be safety. Slow down and exercise caution. In temperatures near freezing, it's prudent to assume icy patches on the road and adjust your driving accordingly. Be on alert for ice accumulating on power lines and tree branches, as they may break and fall. If possible, avoid driving in these conditions altogether. But if you must venture out, choose routes with fewer trees and power lines, and never touch a downed power line. If you encounter one, dial 911 immediately. Here are additional winter driving tips from the weather service:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies, including a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, remain composed. Inform someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Indicate that you need assistance by attaching a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror, and make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers\nBe mindful of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and allow them ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, verify the current road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nStay safe on wintry roads with these valuable winter driving tips from the weather service, and reduce the risk of accidents during challenging weather conditions.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",
