  "text": "Winter storm forces school delay Thursday Local News Jan 3, 2025\nMonica Keller mkeller@timesobserver.com Christmas vacation extended an extra two hours for Warren County school students on Thursday as the first winter storm of the year moved into the county.\nPersistent, mostly light lake effect snow will remain in the area through Sunday. Additional accumulations through Sunday could be between 5 and 12 inches, with winds gusting up to 35 miles an hour.\nThe Warren County School District was also under a 2-hour delay this morning due to the storm. Some of the parents decided to keep their kids home today due to the conditions worsening later in the day.\n“We had crews out at 3:30 a.m. this morning with three trucks out, and at 7 a.m. there were a total of five trucks out. The city is in good shape and has plenty of material on hand including anti-slip material for the roads. We are prepared for this storm. We will continue to monitor the storm,” said Mike Holtz from the City of Warren Public Works Department.\nNewsletter Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Email (Required) I'm interested in (please check all that apply) (Required) Daily Newsletter Breaking News Obituaries Are you a paying subscriber to the newspaper?
