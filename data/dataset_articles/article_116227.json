  "text": "The year 2024 was the warmest on record in India since 1901, with the average minimum temperature settling 0.90 degrees Celsius above the long-period average, the IMD said on Wednesday.\nThe annual mean temperature in 2024 was 25.75 degrees Celsius, 0.65 degrees above the long-period average.\nThe average maximum temperature stood at 31.25 degrees Celsius, 0.20 degrees above normal. The average minimum temperature was 20.24 degrees Celsius, 0.90 degrees above normal, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.\nThe year 2024 surpassed 2016, which had recorded a mean land surface air temperature 0.54 degrees Celsius above normal, making it the warmest year since 1901.\nThe average minimum temperature was the highest on record for July, August, September and October, and the second highest for February, the IMD chief said.\nAccording to the European climate agency Copernicus, 2024 likely ended as the warmest year globally and the first with average temperatures 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels.\nAccording to a yearly review by two independent groups of climate scientists — World Weather Attribution and Climate Central — the world experienced 41 additional days of dangerous heat in 2024.\nMohapatra said the rise in minimum temperatures in 2024 was “quite high”.\n“Long-term data shows most parts of the country are witnessing a rising trend in minimum temperatures, particularly in post-monsoon and winter seasons,” he said.",
