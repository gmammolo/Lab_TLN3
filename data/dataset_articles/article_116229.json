Picture: Dan Linehan\nFri, 03 Jan, 2025 - 09:07 Mairead Sheehy  \n    With sleet and snow expected across the weekend, Met Éireann has said that there is a \"possibility that schools may not open\" on Monday.\nIt comes as a low temperature and ice warning was issued on Thursday and it will be in place until 11am today, with temperatures to drop as low as -10C early next week. A weather advisory for sleet and snow is in place until Monday.\nSub-zero temperatures were recorded in parts of the country overnight, with Oak Park in Carlow and Athenry in Galway among the coldest weather stations.\nPeople can expect another \"frosty night\" later with \"temperatures expected to get down as low as –3C or –4C,\" according to Met Éireann forecaster Gerry Murphy.\nMr Murphy said conditions had taken a “cold and sharp” turn and people should expect a “multi-hazard weather event” over the weekend and into next week.\nHe said there would be sleet and snow in many areas on Saturday evening and into Sunday.\n\"It will most likely fall as rain down along the south coast, but it must be said that the amounts of rain expected in the south and southwest are quite high, so it's likely that we'll see rainfall warnings at least in the southwest of the country,” he told RTÉ's Morning Ireland.\nWhile snow and sleet can be expected in much of the country, he said it looks like it will fall “predominantly” over the southern half of the country and then over much of the midlands and the west on Saturday night.\n“Counties in the northeast mightn't fare too badly because there's an easterly wind,” he said.\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint but really as we go through tomorrow night into Sunday all areas can expect sleet or snow at some stage.”\nThe forecaster said the question of schools opening back from Christmas break on Monday cannot be answered until the weekend, depending on the accumulations of snow.\nA surfer on Marble Hill Strand beach near Dunfanaghy, Co Donegal.\n“There is likely to be accumulations of snow in places on Monday morning, coupled with a very severe frost as well. So there's the possibility that schools may not open, but that will become more apparent as we go through the weekend,” he said.\n“As we get more details on the exact accumulations of that snow, it will give us more information on the exact types of warnings that we will be issuing today and tomorrow,” he said.\nThe cold air is expected to remain until next week, with a northerly breeze passing over the country and keeping temperatures low.\nMr Murphy said the low temperatures will mean the snow would be “slow to melt” in places, which, coupled with frost at night, will result in sub-zero temperatures.\nThis weekend is then expected to bring “very cold” conditions, with disruptive and impactful weather likely that could cause travel and service disruption.\nA Met Éireann advisory issued for the weekend said that we can expect sleet and snow in parts through to Monday.\nConditions will become drier towards the start of next week, with a bitterly cold Arctic airmass across the country and bringing temperatures as low as -10C by Tuesday night.\n“There’ll be treacherous conditions with some significant accumulations of lying snow along with widespread severe frost and ice,” Met Éireann said.\nRead More How a bridge put the brakes on plans for 1,300 Cork City apartments\nWEATHER CENTRE Check out the Irish Examiner's WEATHER CENTRE for regularly updated short and long range forecasts wherever you are.\nIrish Examiner’s WhatsApp channel\nFollow and share the latest news and stories\nmore weather articles\nTemperatures to plummet towards -10C as weather warning kicks in Cold snap depletes EU's gas supplies Warmest year ever caps ‘a decade of deadly heat’ More in this section\nMan, 30s, due to appear in court in connection with New Ross murder Mother and baby home campaigner who threatened to set the dogs on nuns passes away Introduction of free HRT delayed as Dept of Health rows back on Budget pledge #Weather  Man, 60s, dies after jeep collides with electricity pole in Dublin READ NOW Subscribe Now",
