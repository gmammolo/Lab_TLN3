  "text": "FIRST ALERT: Cool weekend ahead, Arctic air settles in next week\nMYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - We continue to look ahead to next week with the Arctic stretch of weather arriving. Until then, expect a cooler forecast into the weekend.\nTODAY\nExpect a few more clouds around this morning with a cold start as you step out the door. Fair weather clouds will give way to sunny skies and an unseasonably cool afternoon.\nTemperatures should climb into the middle 50s today. Looking at the forecast as a whole, today is our second warmest day over the next ten days. Just to show the magnitude of the cold air expected next week.\nA breeze will develop with an approaching cold front this afternoon and continue into the evening hours.\nTHIS WEEKEND\nAnother shot of cold air drops behind the cold front, keeping Saturday nice and cold. Morning temperatures in the upper 20s will only climb into the low-mid 40s by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures will fall into the middle and upper 20s Saturday night.\nWe’ll warm back up into the lower 50s by Sunday afternoon with increasing clouds through the afternoon on Sunday.\nTHE NEXT WEATHER MAKER\nOur next cold front will deliver a round of quick-moving showers to start next week. Highs on Monday will be warm ahead of the cold front with temperatures in the lower 60s. We expect a breezy round of showers before the long stretch of colder weather settles in behind the system for next week.\nARCTIC AIR\nWe’ve been giving you the First Alert to the Arctic air next week for a while now.\nOur confidence in the cold temperatures is high. Temperatures will struggle, only reaching the upper 30s to lower 40s through next week. Overnight lows will fall into the low-mid 20s by the end of the week. Our normal temperatures for this time of year should be in the upper 50s for perspective.\nCopyright 2025 WMBF. All rights reserved.",
