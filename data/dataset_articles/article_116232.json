  "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER: MoDOT urges preparedness ahead of ice and snow\nSPRINGFIELD, Mo. (KY3) - Even if you’re driving cautiously, icy roads can quickly turn into an accident, which could leave you stranded in the bitter cold for a while.\nTemperatures next week could be below zero, but you still have a few days to stock your vehicle with the essentials.\nDistrict Maintenance Engineer Jimmy Shannon with the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) said, “It’s good to make sure that you’ve got warm clothing, something to keep you warm, and an emergency roadside kit so that you can protect yourself.”\nA proper winter emergency checklist should also include nonperishable food, water, a flashlight, a full tank of gas, and kitty litter or sand to help regain traction if your vehicle becomes stuck.\nMoDOT’s fleet of 293 trucks will begin treating roads as early as Saturday. Drivers are advised to stay alert and give road crews plenty of space to operate.\n“They’re making the roadways clear, so it’s much safer to travel,” Shannon said, “just make sure you give them plenty of room. Don’t get too close or crowd them.”\nIt’s recommended to stay 200 feet behind snow plows if possible. Shannon’s number one advice? Avoid driving altogether if possible.\nEmma Sneed, who was unaware of the pending winter storm, shared her preparation plans.\n“Honestly, I just got my food, water, and snacks,” Sneed said, “I’m getting gas now, so I’ll be ready to stay safe.\nSneed’s vigilance comes after a personal experience with icy roads last year that left her truck totaled.\n“I just got into a wreck not too long ago because of the ice,” she said, discouraged, “totaled my truck. Definitely from experience, stay safe out there.”\nThis time, Sneed is planning to avoid the roads entirely, choosing a staycation with her pet cat, Two, instead.\n“Definitely staying off the roads, especially with this little one in the car,” she said, turning to Two, “I’m going to keep you safe.”\nMoDOT encourages everyone to plan ahead, stay informed about weather conditions, and prioritize safety this weekend.\nThe biggest challenge is the timing of the rain. If it washes away the pre-treatment, it will leave a clean slate for snow and ice accumulation.\nFor real-time updates on road conditions, visit\n[MoDOT’s Traveler Information Map.](https://traveler.modot.org/map/index.html)\nTo report a correction or typo, please email\n[digitalnews@ky3.com](mailto:digitalnews@ky3.com).
