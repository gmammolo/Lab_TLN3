  "text": "NY weather: Winter weather advisory issued for Orleans and Monroe counties until Sunday evening Published: Jan. 03, 2025, 3:39 a.m. By Advance Local Weather Alerts On Friday at 3:33 a.m. the National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory valid from 2 p.m. until Sunday 6 p.m. for Orleans and Monroe counties.\nThe weather service comments, \"Total snow accumulations 6 to 12 inches in the most persistent lake snows, spread out in several batches over the next few days. Winds gusting as high as 30 mph today through tonight, and 40 mph Saturday through Saturday night, will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow.\"\n\"Travel will be difficult at times with snow covered roads. Areas of blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions will impact the Friday evening commute,\" describes the weather service. \"Lake effect snow will fall in relatively narrow bands. If traveling, be prepared for rapidly changing road conditions and visibilities. During lake effect snow, the weather can vary from bands of locally heavy snow with greatly reduced visibilities to dry conditions just a few miles away. Be prepared for rapid changes in weather, visibility, and road conditions.\"\nWinter driving guide: Tips from the weather service for safe and sound travels Winter weather can make driving treacherous, leading to over 6,000 weather-related vehicle fatalities and over 480,000 injuries each year. When traveling during snow or freezing rain, prioritize safety by slowing down. In near-freezing temperatures, it's safest to assume that icy conditions exist on roadways and adjust your driving accordingly. Be cautious of ice accumulating on power lines or tree branches, which can lead to snapping and falling hazards. If possible, avoid driving in such conditions. If you must venture out, opt for routes with fewer trees and power lines. Never touch a downed power line, and immediately dial 911 if you come across one. Here are additional winter driving tips from the weather service:\nShare your travel plans:\nWhen traveling out of town in hazardous winter weather, inform your family or friends of your destination, planned route, and estimated time of arrival.\nPrepare your vehicle:\nEnsure your gas tank is full and equip your vehicle with essential winter supplies such as a windshield scraper, jumper cables, a small shovel, flashlight, cell phone, blanket, extra warm clothing, drinking water, and high-calorie non-perishable food.\nStay calm when stranded:\nIf you become stranded, remain composed. Inform someone about your situation and location. Avoid attempting to walk to safety. Indicate that you need assistance by attaching a cloth to your car's antenna or mirror, and make your vehicle more visible by using the dome light and flashers\nBe aware of snow plows:\nKeep an eye out for snow plows and provide them with ample room to pass. Only overtake a plow when you have a clear view of the road ahead.\nCheck road conditions:\nBefore embarking on your journey, check the latest road conditions to make informed travel decisions.\nThese winter driving tips from the weather service are your key to a safer journey on snow-covered roads. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of accidents and ensure your well-being during challenging winter weather.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
