Bay, Calhoun, and Liberty counties were forecast for 25.\nMoving southward, temperatures improve, though only marginally, with counties like Gilchrist, Alachua, and Bradford just breaking into the low 30s.\nPivotal Weather said the map was valid until January 7, although forecasts are often updated.\nThe Arctic polar vortex is a strong band of west-to-east winds that form in the stratosphere during winter, approximately 10 to 30 miles above the North Pole.\nIn the Northern Hemisphere’s winter, the polar vortex often expands, driving cold air southward alongside the jet stream, according to the agency.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) previously forecast a high likelihood of the Sunshine State seeing below-average temperatures this January.\nWhat People Are Saying Meteorologist John Brown wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday: “Artic air could bring Florida the coldest weather of the year, lows may reach freezing levels.”\nAccuWeather senior meteorologist John Feerick told Newsweek: “Cold temperatures are likely to have the greatest impact in northern parts of the state and across the interior. Actual temperatures can drop below freezing at night in the north and it’s possible the interior of central Florida also dips below the freezing mark.”\nWhat Happens Next Forecast models have predicted that cold air will spread across the U.S. from early to mid-January.\nThe NWS urges the public to monitor their local forecast at weather.gov to ensure they are dressed appropriately for the weather. While the agency stressed that there was no reason for alarm about the polar vortex, it advised staying prepared for colder conditions.\nDo you have a story we should be covering?
