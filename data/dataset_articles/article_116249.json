The amber cold health alert is in place until 12pm next Wednesday (January 8).\nDuring the cold health alert, the UKHSA has warned that health services could be overwhelmed with demand. There may also be transport disruption due to freezing temperatures.\nThe disruption may include:\na rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions. We may also see impacts on younger age groups a likely increase in demand for health services temperatures inside places like hospitals, care homes, and clinics dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks challenges keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18°C leading to more risk to vulnerable people staffing issues due to external factors (such as travel delays) other sectors starting to observe impacts (such as transport and energy)\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
