  "text": "12 minutes ago Check NWS updates here\nEffective: 2025-01-03 04:40:00 EST Expires: 2025-01-03 12:45:00 EST Urgency: Expected Severity: Severe Certainty: Likely Instruction: Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on their vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area or conduct mitigation. Mariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the vessel for hazardous conditions. Target Area: Lake Superior West of Line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI Beyond 5NM from shore; Lake Superior East of a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a line from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM from shore; Lake Superior from Grand Marais MI to Whitefish Point MI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian border * WHAT...For the Gale Warning, northwest winds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 40 kt and waves 10 to 15 ft expected. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate on vessels.\n* WHERE...Lake Superior West of Line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI Beyond 5NM from shore, Lake Superior East of a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a line from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM from shore and Lake Superior from Grand Marais MI to Whitefish Point MI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian border.\n* WHEN...From noon today to 7 AM EST Sunday.\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is hazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and superstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
