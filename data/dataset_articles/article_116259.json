He has the latest TIMING and impacts of a possible winter storm this weekend LIVE on News Center 7 Daybreak starting at 4:25 a.m.\nTRENDING STORIES:\nUPDATE: Coroner responds to shooting in Englewood\nVP-Elect JD Vance in region for ‘personal reasons’ after motorcade spotted Thursday\nDrivers encouraged to prepared with accumulating snow expected\nTIMING:\nThe snow falling right now will taper off during Daybreak but will likely leave frozen and slippery spots for the morning commute.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement There will also be some accumulations, according to Marando.\nOur Storm Center 7 team of meteorologists continues to track a possible winter storm this weekend.\nPhoto from: Ryan Marando/Staff Marando says the likely timeline is late Sunday through Monday.\n“Snow should be the main precipitation type locally but we are watching for the potential of sleet and freezing rain to mix south of I-70,” he said.\nPhoto from: Ryan Marando/Staff Areas expected to see all snow could get at least six inches of snow. Ice could creep into the Miami Valley thanks to a layer of warmer air. That would cut down on snowfall totals.\nThe models are still trying to iron out the exact details.\nIMPACTS:\nDifficult travel is likely. Road crews may not catch up until after the snow ends late Monday.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement The worst travel conditions will occur late Sunday night through early Monday morning due to heavy snow and reduced visibility.\nThere is still some uncertainty in the specific storm track. Shifts north or south will change where the axis of heaviest snow sets up.\nIt appears unlikely however that we miss out on snow at this point.\nPhoto from: Ryan Marando/Staff Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement [SIGN UP: WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter ]\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 25,399 people played the daily Crossword recently.
