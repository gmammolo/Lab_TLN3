  "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called for more proactive support for workers displaced by artificial intelligence (AI). On the 14th, local time, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva stated in the IMF’s official blog, “Policymakers should consider redesigning education systems to ensure young people can leverage AI rather than compete with it when entering the labor market.”The IMF has consistently warned that AI will impact future jobs and employment. Georgieva noted, “Recent large-scale layoffs have shown that even companies at the forefront of innovation are not immune to these changes,” adding, “New professions are emerging, offering alternative pathways to prosperity.”According to recent IMF research, 1 in 10 job postings in advanced economies and 1 in 20 in emerging economies now require at least one new skill.Georgieva emphasized, “With approximately 40% of global jobs expected to be affected by AI-driven changes, concerns about job losses and reduced opportunities for certain groups are growing,” stressing, “Proactive and inclusive policies are needed to ensure the benefits of AI are equitably distributed.”The IMF chief argued that workers acquiring new skills in the evolving era should receive higher wages than before, as this could stimulate local economies. In the UK and US job markets, postings requiring new skills offer wages approximately 3% higher than average. For roles demanding four or more new skills, wages are up to 15% higher in the UK and 8.5% higher in the US.Georgieva urged countries to help workers adapt to new environments and continuously engage in the labor market by acquiring skills. She stated, “Affordable housing and flexible work environments should enhance worker mobility,” and “Social safety nets must be improved to better support those undergoing difficult career transitions and facilitate their reintegration into the workforce.”She also highlighted the need to redesign education systems. As many IT tasks are likely to be automated by AI, education should focus on cultivating cognitive, creative, and technical skills to utilize AI rather than compete with it. Georgieva noted, “Finland, Ireland, and Denmark are positioned to lead in cultivating a workforce equipped with the skills and flexibility needed for the future,” attributing this to “robust investments in higher education and lifelong learning programs that help workers adapt to technological advancements.”",
