  "text": "Nearly 400,000 homes and businesses in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont grappled with power outages early Friday after a severe winter storm dumped several inches of snow in the northeast region and caused major travel disruptions.\nHeavy snow covers Beaver Meadow Golf Course in Concord, N.H., on Thursday.\nKey Facts According to Power Outage.us, more than 285,000 homes were without power in Maine early on Friday.\nIn a statement on Facebook, the state’s largest power supplier, Central Maine Power Company, said its crews were working to restore power in all affected areas but added that the “damage is severe and repairs are expected to take multiple days.”\nIn neighboring New Hampshire, more than 109,000 homes and businesses remained without power early on Friday, along with 14,500 in Vermont.\nNew Hampshire’s biggest electricity provider, Eversource, said its crews were also working overnight to restore power in affected areas but warned: “This will be a multi-day restoration effort.”\nThe state’s other major power provider, New Hampshire Electric Co-Op, also sought patience from customers and said they are facing a “lengthy restoration process.”\nWhat To Watch For In an update Friday morning, the National Weather Service said the low-pressure system that caused the northeast winter storm would “linger around Downeast Maine” for the next few days and spread “snow showers” across the state and nearby areas that may be as high as 4 to 8 inches. But the “heaviest snowfall” is expected to end at night.\nCrucial Quote “As crews continue to clear the roads, I urge Maine people to drive safely during the Friday morning commute…Be sure to move over for plow trucks, utility crews, and first responders working to keep us safe—it’s the law,” Maine Governor Janet Mills said, adding that all state offices will open after 11 a.m. local time on Friday.",
