  "text": "Will Massive Snowstorm Impact New York This Weekend?\nA massive 1500-mile snowstorm is setting up in the middle part of the country and is expected to bring plenty of snow, but will it impact New York State?\nAs of this morning, this storm system will not impact New York State. Current weather models are calling for it to stay south of New York State, with places like Ohio and Pennsylvania getting most of the snow from this system.\nJust because this season won't impact New York, doesn't mean parts of the state won't get snow this weekend. If fact there are still several weather alerts for parts of the state with a lake effect snow warning in place for parts of New York.\nMost of the snow will come late on Friday and on Saturday. Temperatures are also expected to remain very cold with highs in the 20s and 30 through next week.\nREAD MORE: THIS NEW YORK TOWN COULD BE EPICENTER OF MASSIVE SNOWSTORM IN 2025\n10 Items That Are Illegal To Put In A Recycling Bin in New York State\nGallery Credit: Canva",
