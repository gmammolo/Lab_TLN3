  "text": "Franklin County and nearly two dozen other counties in Ohio are bracing for winter weather as a snow advisory has been issued from midnight Thursday to 10 a.m. Friday. According to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Wilmington, residents can expect one to two inches of snow overnight and into the morning hours.\nRoads, particularly bridges and overpasses, are expected to become “slick and hazardous,” prompting caution for morning commuters. This advisory comes as Ohio prepares to enter the new year with a series of snow events, signaling the arrival of a true winter season after a snowless Christmas in 2024.\nSnowfall to Usher in the New Year Columbus and surrounding areas are set to experience multiple rounds of snow in the coming days. After Friday morning’s snowfall, residents can look forward to a brief respite on Saturday. However, the winter weather returns on Sunday, with a 50% chance of snow beginning after 1 p.m. The likelihood increases to 80% by Sunday night, with more accumulation expected.\nThe snowy conditions don’t end there, as there is another 50% chance of snow on Monday, prolonging the wintry weather into the week.\nDetailed Forecast for the Week As Franklin County and neighboring regions brace for the snowy conditions, here’s the forecast to help plan your winter activities:\n•Thursday Night to Friday Morning: Snowfall of 1–2 inches with slick and icy road conditions.\n•Saturday: Clear skies with a temporary break from snowfall.\n•Sunday Afternoon: A 50% chance of snow starting after 1 p.m., increasing to 80% by night.\n•Monday: Another round of snow with a 50% chance of precipitation.\nAs Ohioans prepare for the frosty conditions, it’s a good time to ensure vehicles are winter-ready, stay updated on road conditions, and plan for safe travels during this snowy period.",
