  "text": "First Alert: Winter Storm to impact the Tri-States this weekend A winter storm watch has been issued for parts of the Tri-States (maxuser | Gray Stations with MAX) By Nico Sanchez Published: Jan. 2, 2025 at 3:58 PM CST | Updated: 4 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nQUINCY (WGEM) - We are under First Alert, as a winter storm watch has been issued for Knox, Lewis, Marion, Ralls, Shelby, and Monroe counties in Missouri and Adams, Schuyler, Brown, Pike, and Scott counties in Illinois. This winter storm watch is for Saturday evening at 6:00pm and lasts through Monday morning at 6:00am. This watch is calling for snowfall totals between 8-11 inches, which would pose a significant travel impact across the entirety of the Tri-States.\nThe remainder of Thursday, a chance for a few light snow showers is in the forecast for the northern tier of the Tri-States, with scattered rain showers in the central and southern tiers of the Tri-States. Then, the chance will turn into light snow showers for the entirety of the Tri-States, dwindling into the night time hours. Temperatures will fall into the mid-20′s overnight, before only rising back into the upper-20′s to end the work week. Partly cloudy skies will remain in the forecast, with lows down into the teens.\nHeading into the weekend, we will definitely be reminded that we are in January. Temperatures will rise into the mid-20′s Saturday, with increasing clouds in the forecast. Then, by Saturday night, we can expect snow to begin falling in the Tri-States. Snow is forecast to begin around midnight Sunday morning, and will last through the entire day Sunday. Snowfall total accumulations will likely be above 6″, before beginning to taper off into early Monday morning. Temperatures will remain on the cold side through the weekend, before we plummet heading into the next week.\nAs we move into the new week, highs will dip down into the teens, with lows in the single digits. This arctic airmass will settle for quite some time, as very cold conditions remain in the forecast into next weekend. Wind chill values will be very cold, dropping below zero during this time, therefore it is precautioned to cover up extensively when heading outside to prevent frostbite.\nCopyright 2025 WGEM.
