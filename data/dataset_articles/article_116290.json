Winds will pick up as the systems approach, and small craft advisories could be issued for local waters.\nLows in the upper 20s — or lower 30s closer to the coast — are expected the night of Jan. 3, and temperatures are forecast to drop a few more degrees the following night. The daytime highs will follow a similar pattern, with Jan. 3 highs just below 60 and high temperatures Jan. 4 about 10 degrees cooler.\nThe first cold snap will be fairly short lived, and temperatures will moderate a bit Jan. 5.\n\"The swings with the temperatures are pretty normal for this time of year,\" said Anna Dennis, a Charleston-based National Weather Service meteorologist.\nBeaufort County News Beaufort County passes on Passiment as chair amid 'secret meeting' concerns By Jessica Wade jwade@postandcourier.com Rain will follow Jan. 6, with only modest accumulations of up to a quarter inch expected. The rain will help offset the dry conditions that exist in portions of the Lowcountry. Latest data from the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties are experiencing either abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions. Portions of Beaufort and Colleton counties also are abnormally dry.\nAnyone hoping that the combination of chilly temperatures and precipitation will mean a coating of snow likely will be disappointed. Temperatures are expected to remain above freezing while the rain moves through. The current National Weather Service forecast does not call for any frozen precipitation in the region.\nThe process begins to repeat itself on Jan. 6 as another front moves in. There will be one difference, however.\n\"We'll see considerably colder weather behind this second front,\" said NWS meteorologist Douglas Berry.\nMilitary Digest North and South clashed 160 years ago. Now cadaver dogs are sniffing out clues on a SC battlefield. By Tony Kukulich tkukulich@postandcourier.com By the night of Jan. 6, temperatures will be in the mid-20s. The following two nights are expected to be even colder. Cold weather advisories are issued when temperatures drop to 20 degrees or lower.\n\"Wednesday night looks to be the coldest of the week,\" Berry said.\nCold temperatures could be problematic for gardens and outdoor plants, particularly those that can't be brought indoors.\n\"If you know that you're going to have a frost, you're going to want to cover your plants up,\" said Glen Payne, an urban horticulture agent with Clemson University's Beaufort County Extension Office.",
