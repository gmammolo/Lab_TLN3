  "text": "Central Illinois is bracing for a series of freezing nights and potential snowfall as winter weather patterns take hold in the region. With temperatures expected to drop significantly, residents should prepare for cold conditions and the likelihood of snow accumulation.\nWhy It Matters Icing, snow, and other wintry weather effects pose a risk to travel conditions and can disrupt other aspects of daily life, such as prompting school closures.\nCertain groups, such as young infants and senior citizens, are also at higher risk from plunging temperatures.\nWhat To Know The service said there was “growing confidence” that a storm will produce “significant wintry weather” beginning later this week.\nRegions in the Central Plains and Mississippi Valley, particularly along and north of Interstate 70, are likely to experience heavy snowfall, with a 60-80 percent chance of accumulating at least six inches, the NWS said.\nThe NWS map shows that central Illinois, northern Missouri, and parts of western and central Indiana are most likely to experience the storm’s effects. It is also likely in parts of Maryland, Kansas, and Ohio.\nThere is also at least a 40 percent chance of impacts in Delaware, northeast Virginia, southern Iowa, northeastern West Virginia, some northern regions of Kentucky, and the southeastern tip of Nebraska, as well as small pockets of New Jersey.\nThe NWS said there is potential for significant sleet and freezing rain to impact eastern Kansas and the Ozarks, possibly extending eastward into the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys this weekend.\nAdditionally, some icing may affect portions of the southern Appalachians on Sunday.\nStates with the greatest potential for “significant” icing included parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas.\nWhat People Are Saying Meteorologist Jim Cantore wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “This is a great depiction of what that storm will produce Saturday night through Tuesday morning and the challenges… that lie ahead.”\nMeteorologist Jacob Dickey wrote on X: “Major travel impacts likely across Central and Southern Illinois by Midday Sunday with the approaching winter storm. Keeping a very close eye on things, the storm arrives Sunday morning. Amounts sare till TBD, but areas with over 6” appear likely.\n“Travel impacts across the Southern part of Illinois south of I-70 are expected to be major from potential ice and freezing rain. The central part of the state is expected to see more snow.”",
