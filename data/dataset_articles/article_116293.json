  "text": "There is a risk of sleet or snow in all parts of Ireland this weekend which could see schools stay closed on Monday, forecasters have said.\nSub-zero temperatures are expected for the coming days, with people urged to take care on the roads during the cold snap.\nA status yellow ice warning is in place on Friday morning for all counties on the island of Ireland, bar Co Fermanagh, with more weather alerts expected.\nMet Éireann forecaster Gerry Murphy said conditions had taken a “cold and sharp” turn and people should expect a “multi-hazard weather event” over the weekend and into next week.\nHe said there would be sleet and snow in many areas on Saturday evening and into Sunday.\n“It will most likely fall as rain down the south coast but it must be said that the amounts of rain expected in the south and south-west are quite high, so it’s likely that we will see rainfall warnings, at least, in the south-west of the country,” Mr Murphy told RTÉ’s Radio One.\n“Then, as that rain pushes up through the afternoon/evening, it turns more to sleet, as you go in the hours of darkness then turning more to snow – currently, it looks like – predominantly over the southern half of the country.\n“Then over much of the Midlands, the west, perhaps tomorrow night early on.\n“Counties in the north-east mightn’t fare too badly because there is an easterly wind.\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint but really as we go through tomorrow night into Sunday all areas can expect sleet or snow at some stage.”\nMr Murphy said it would not be clear until the weekend whether schools would open on Monday when they can see how much snow has accumulated.\n[\nIreland\nMan (60s) dies after jeep collides with electricit...\nRead More\n](https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/man-60s-dies-after-jeep-collides-with-electricity-pole-in-dublin-1713767.html)\n“There are likely to be accumulations of snow in places on Monday morning coupled with a very severe frost as well.\n“So there is the possibility that schools may not open but that will become more apparent as we go through the weekend.”\nHe said into next week, low temperatures will continue which will make it difficult for snow to melt.",
