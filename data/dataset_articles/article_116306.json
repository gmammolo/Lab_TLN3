  "text": "Snowstorm expected to start in Hagerstown region late Sunday: What we know\nThe Monday morning and afternoon commutes could get messy as the National Weather Service is forecasting a few inches of snow late Sunday through Monday afternoon in the Hagerstown region, including southern Franklin County, Pa.\nMeteorologists in the Baltimore/Washington and State College, Pa., forecast offices said Thursday morning it was too soon to put a number on how many inches of snow the area could get. However meteorologist Cody Ledbetter with the Baltimore/Washington office said it's likely the Hagerstown area will get at least a few inches of snow.\nLedbetter said the snow is expected to start late Sunday afternoon or evening and could linger into late Monday afternoon or evening.\nStorm tracks can change that far out, but as of Thursday morning the Washington County area was expected to get all snow, with more of a wintry mix farther south.\nHagerstown Public Works Director Eric Deike said Thursday morning he was seeing reports of 1 to 3 inches of snow expected locally.\nAs the storm starts, crews will disperse salt on bridges and roads, Deike said. If the city gets 3 inches of snow, crews will plow the snow and distribute salt on driving surfaces, he said.\nLedbetter and meteorologist Joe Bauco with the State College forecast office said temperatures are expected to remain below freezing during the snowstorm. Ledbetter said it's expected to be \"very cold\" the next two weeks.\nThe snow is expected to stick and there's potential for black ice, Bauco said.\nDeike said even with temperatures below freezing, if the sun comes out Tuesday that should help melt snow off the asphalt.\nEditor's Note: Please send notices about weather-related cancellations and postponements to webupdate@herald-mail.com.",
