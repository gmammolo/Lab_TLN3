  "text": "A major winter storm is set to sweep through the Mid-Atlantic starting Sunday night, bringing snow, freezing rain, and icy conditions that are likely to disrupt travel and daily activities. Areas from central Pennsylvania to northern Virginia are expected to feel the brunt of the storm, with forecasters urging residents to prepare for hazardous conditions.\nCredit: US National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington What to Expect\nWestern suburbs of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., could see up to six inches of snow, while parts of West Virginia and western Maryland may be buried under as much as 15 inches. In contrast, areas farther south, including parts of Virginia and the Carolinas, are more likely to see sleet and freezing rain.\n“This storm will make roads slick and dangerous, especially late Sunday into Monday morning,” said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist with AccuWeather. “Freezing rain could turn even short trips into hazardous journeys.”\nTravel Concerns\nThe storm is expected to peak overnight Sunday and into Monday morning, making it difficult for commuters heading into work or school. Snow and ice will likely create treacherous conditions on roads, particularly on bridges and overpasses.\nLocal officials are advising residents to avoid unnecessary travel during the storm. Even small amounts of ice can cause significant hazards, and road crews may struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing conditions.\nLingering Cold Air\nAfter the storm passes, cold temperatures will linger for several days, keeping snow and ice from melting quickly. This extended chill could also set the stage for more winter weather later in January.\nPower outages are another concern, especially in areas where ice builds up on trees and power lines. Residents are encouraged to stock up on essentials, including food, water, and batteries, in case of extended outages.\nHow to Prepare\nAvoid travel unless absolutely necessary, especially late Sunday and early Monday. Stock up on essentials such as groceries, water, and medications. Prepare for possible power outages with flashlights, blankets, and emergency supplies. Monitor local weather alerts for the latest updates.",
