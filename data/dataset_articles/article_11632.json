  "text": "AInvest Newsletter\nDaily stocks & crypto headlines, free to your inbox\nThe U.S. posted a $145 billion deficit in December 2025, a 67% increase year-over-year due to calendar-driven benefit payment shifts and rising government spending. Tariff revenue plateaued at $27.9 billion in December, a decline from recent months but still sharply higher than $6.8 billion in December 2024. Adjusting for calendar shifts, the adjusted deficit would have been $112 billion, an 11% decline compared to the previous year.\nThe U.S. December 2025 budget deficit hit a headline-making $145 billion, surpassing expectations and capturing attention from investors and policymakers alike. While calendar quirks inflated the numbers—such as $32 billion in January 2026 benefit payments moved into December—this figure still highlights the underlying fiscal pressures in the current administration's spending priorities.\nFor retail investors, the key takeaway is not just the headline number, but the broader trend of rising outlays and the plateauing of tariff revenue. The Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy has helped boost customs receipts, but recent data suggests that this revenue stream may be hitting a ceiling, even as the president continues to frame tariffs as a financial lifeline for his fiscal ambitions.\nThe Treasury Department attributed the December deficit largely to two factors: a surge in outlays and calendar-driven shifts in benefit payments. Specifically, $32 billion in January 2026 benefit payments were moved into December because the new year started on a weekend, while $80 billion in December 2024 payments were moved to November\n. These adjustments, if accounted for, would have brought the deficit down to $112 billion—still a 67% increase from December 2024, but a 14 billion or 11% decrease in adjusted terms.The broader context is a fiscal year that saw the U.S. government spend $629 billion in December alone, up from $541 billion in December 2024. The rise in outlays—coupled with flat or even declining tax receipts—means that while the adjusted deficit shows some improvement, the overall fiscal trajectory\n.Tariffs collected in December 2025 totaled $27.9 billion, a drop from the recent $30 billion range but a sharp increase from $6.8 billion in December 2024\n. This surge in customs revenue has been one of the few bright spots in the fiscal landscape. However, the trend appears to be plateauing, and analysts are watching closely to see if the revenue stream can be sustained as global trade dynamics continue to shift.In fact, the U.S. Treasury\nin tariff revenue from November to December 2025, suggesting that the administration's tariff-heavy strategy may not provide the long-term fiscal cushion that Trump and his allies have claimed. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has also by $1 trillion, casting doubt on the viability of tariffs as a long-term funding mechanism for the government's ambitious spending plans.For investors, the December deficit report serves as a reminder that while the headline figures may fluctuate due to calendar anomalies, the underlying fiscal pressures remain. The government's spending as a share of GDP remains high—around 23%—and efforts to reduce the deficit are being constrained by both elevated spending and flat tax revenue\n.The recent decline in the trade deficit—which fell to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest since 2009—also signals a shift in trade patterns, but this too is being driven by Trump's tariffs, which have led to a restructuring of global trade routes\n. While this may benefit certain domestic industries, it also raises the risk of retaliatory measures from trading partners and could disrupt supply chains.Looking ahead, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade\n. Analysts argue that without significant spending cuts or revenue increases, the fiscal situation could deteriorate further. For now, the adjusted deficit offers a glimmer of hope, but investors should remain cautious about the long-term sustainability of current fiscal policies.The first three months of fiscal 2026 have seen a 15% drop in the deficit year-over-year, with net customs receipts alone rising to $90 billion from $20.8 billion in the same period in 2024\n. While this improvement is welcome, it masks the fact that corporate tax receipts in December 2025 dropped 28% year-over-year to $65 billion.Investors should also keep an eye on Trump's continued push for a $500 billion increase in the military budget, which he has framed as being funded by tariffs. Given the plateauing of tariff revenue and the CBO's revised forecasts, this claim is increasingly hard to justify. If the administration continues to push fiscal policies that outpace revenue sources, the deficit—and with it, long-term economic risks—could widen once again.\nAs the fiscal year progresses, the next key data point will be the full-year deficit report for 2025. If it confirms the current trends—of a smaller but still significant deficit—investors may see continued pressure on interest rates and market confidence. For now, the December report serves as a reminder: even with adjustments, the U.S. fiscal landscape remains complex and uncertain.\nDaily stocks & crypto headlines, free to your inbox",
