WXCharts shows a large band of snow covering England from the south to north coast on Tuesday, January 7.\nA 351-mile wall of snow is predicted to blanket parts of the country at 6pm on Tuesday, as per weather maps from WXCharts. Parts of West and South Yorkshire could see up to 10.75cm (4.2in) of snowfall per hour by 6pm that day, according to WXCharts.com.\nHowever, parts of Shropshire could witness up to 16.07cm (6in) of snow an hour at 3pm on Tuesday. The snow band will continue its eastward sweep across England, with the weather expected to clear by 12pm on Wednesday, January 8.\nYet, temperatures are set to plummet at 6am on Thursday morning, January 9, with households waking up to freezing conditions. Parts of south west England could experience temperatures of -6C, while in the north of England, it could fall to as low as -7C.\nThis comes as the UK is currently experiencing a January cold snap. Yellow warnings for snow and ice have been issued for northern parts of the country today, reports Birmingham Live .\nMeanwhile, a 45-hour snow warning is in place across large parts of England and Wales over the weekend. The yellow weather alert has been issued for between 12pm on Saturday, January 4, and 9am Monday, January 6.\nThe Met Office has issued a warning about potential travel disruptions due to the incoming wintry weather, which could affect roads and railways and even lead to power cuts. They stated: \"Outbreaks of rain spreading north-eastwards later on Saturday and overnight into Sunday will likely be preceded by a spell of snow on its northern flank.\n\"Whilst there is a fair bit of uncertainty as to how far north this may spread, and how long any snow will last, significant accumulations of snow are possible, especially (but not exclusively) on hills.\n\"Currently, parts of the Midlands, Wales and northern England are most at risk of disruption, where 5cm or more could accumulate fairly widely, with perhaps as much as 20-30cm over high ground of Wales and/or the Pennines. This, accompanied by strengthening winds, may lead to drifting of lying snow.\"\nA large band of snow could sweep parts of the UK on Tuesday (Image: WX Charts)\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
