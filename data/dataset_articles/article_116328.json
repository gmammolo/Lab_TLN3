  "text": "A yellow warning for ice is in place for four counties in Northern Ireland.\nThe Met Office issued the alert, which took effect at 16:00 GMT on Friday and lasts until 10:00 GMT on Saturday.\nThe warning applies to counties Antrim, Down, Londonderry and Tyrone.\nThere was widespread frost and a warning for ice and slippery surfaces on Friday morning, with Katesbridge in County Down recording the coldest temperature on the island of Ireland at -6C (21.2F).\nWeather Watcher Ian Ballymena in County Antrim has also experienced icy conditions The Met Office said icy surfaces could lead to difficult travel conditions and slips and falls could lead to injuries.\nThere is also a significant risk of snow falling in parts of Northern Ireland overnight Saturday into Sunday morning.\nThe exact track of the low-pressure area as it slides east across Ireland and pushes north will determine where any disruptive snow falls and due to that uncertainty a weather warning for snow has not yet been issued.\nWeather models are still at odds with how far north into Northern Ireland this weather system will get.\nNI Water Naimh McElroy, from NI Water, said water can look \"frozen\" but it's important to take \"care\" The Met Office says \"a more targeted weather warning\" may yet be issued, possibly on Saturday morning.\n\"There is still a lot to play for and if we do end up with a snow Sunday there should still be time to get the main road network treated for Monday morning,\" it said.\nAt this stage, the latest data suggest 3-6cm of snow falling mainly across southeastern areas.\n'Risk of someone drowning' Naimh McElroy, from NI Water, said people should take \"extra care\" around waterways during the cold snap.\nReservoirs and loughs can \"look frozen but if they freeze over it's impossible to tell how thick the ice is,\" she said.\nShe warned that \"ice can be thin in places\" and \"there is a very real risk of someone drowning.\"\n\"Dog owners also need to remember to keep four legged friends on a lead if they are being walked near reservoirs and other bodies of open water,\" she added.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, an orange warning for snow and ice has been issued for six counties, with significant snowfall expected.\nThe warning will be in place from 17:00 local time on Saturday until 17:00 on Sunday for counties Carlow, Clare, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary and Wicklow.\nIrish weather service Met Éireann said there would be severe frost and hazardous travelling conditions in some areas.\nSports fixtures could also be affected by the weather, with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) saying it would be monitoring the condition of playing surfaces over the weekend .\nHow to drive safely on ice Getty Images The Met Office has said it is safer not to drive in icy conditions, but recommends a number of precautions that drivers should take it if is necessary:\nLooking well ahead for potential hazards and keep your speed down Accelerating, braking, steering and changing gear as smoothly as possible to reduce the risk of a skid Using a higher gear may be more appropriate to help grip on packed ice Using a higher gear helps manage engine power making it easier to find traction The service also urged cyclists to stick to main roads, which are more likely to have been treated, and for all road users to leave more time to complete their journey.\nAs the cold weather continues, NI Water , external has reminded the public to be aware of the risk of frozen pipes, as they pose a risk to properties and possessions.\nAdvice includes wrapping your pipes and water tanks up, fixing dripping taps, knowing how to turn off your property's stop tap, checking your central heating boiler has been serviced and leaving the heating on low if you are going away.\nTemperatures fall to -7.9C with snow warnings for weekend How to drive in snow and icy weather",
