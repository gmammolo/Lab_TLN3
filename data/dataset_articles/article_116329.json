  "text": "Staying colder today with scattered snow showers\nSAGINAW, Mich. (WNEM) - More snow showers will move through mid-Michigan today, some of which has already come through early this morning. These early-morning snow showers have been steady enough to bring light accumulations on roadways, so remember to drive to the current conditions! There haven’t been any major delays but bridges and overpasses in particular could stay slick.\nThe longer outlook continues to support below-freezing temperatures. This will be good for our area ice fishers! While we’re lacking ice again right now, we’ll be building ice back up through the coming week. Snowmobilers and skiers, now we have the cold air in place... we just need the snow! [Click here](https://www.wnem.com/weather/forecast/7-day/) for a look ahead at the cold 7-Day First Alert Forecast!\nToday\nThis morning there’s already a light coating of fresh snow on many roadways from the Bay Region and south. Though we haven’t had any major issues regarding delays, you still might want to factor a few extra minutes into your routine this morning!\nScattered snow showers will continue today due to the wind direction being more favorable again: northwesterly. Additionally, a weak disturbance passing through has been just enough to bring some favorable large-scale dynamics too, essentially conditions which are able to make snow more efficiently. The scattered nature of these snow showers today will last most of the daytime in an on-and-off fashion. By this evening though, most activity will start coming to an end.\nRoscommon County is highlighted specifically by a [Winter Weather Advisory](https://www.wnem.com/weather/alerts/). There, the lake-effect will be a little bit more frequent than the rest of our area, leading to locally higher snow totals. While Ogemaw County is not included, some of these bands could reach into there at times too. Overall, most of mid-Michigan only sees a dusting or light coating out of today’s snow showers, while Roscommon specifically could see totals as high as 2″ to 5″. The northern Thumb could also have a slightly higher total given some enhancement from the Saginaw Bay, but those totals have a ceiling at just 2″.\nHighs today will reach 26 degrees with the northwest wind sustained at 10 to 15 mph, gusting to 25 mph. This wind is the same speed as the last few days now. Wind chills will be in the middle teens at best. The normal high for January 3rd is 31 degrees.\nTonight\nOther than a stray flurry, a dry night is ahead with mostly cloudy skies. Lows will fall to 16 degrees though with the same northwest wind holding on. Be prepared for single digit wind chills on Saturday morning if you’re heading out for any early errands or activities!\nWeekend Forecast\nThis weekend is generally on the quieter-side of the coin by winter standards! Temperatures will remain cold, but snow chances are minimal. We’ll start with mostly cloudy skies Saturday before turning partly cloudy late in the day. Clouds will then build back in on Sunday. During this time, only a stray flurry or two are possible. The better chance of snowfall will be in the northern Lower Peninsula.\nHighs will only reach 23 degrees Saturday, if not, even colder for some. Lows will fall to 15 degrees on Saturday night. Highs reach 25 degrees on Sunday. The same northwest wind gusting to 25 mph from Friday will hold on all weekend long too. Again, while cold, it’ll be quiet! We hope you have a great weekend and kick off 2025 on a great note!\nCopyright 2025 WNEM. All rights reserved.",
