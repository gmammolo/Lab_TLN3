  "text": "Sinn Féin criticises Government as just one-third of eligible renters claim tax credit\nEoin Ó Broin urges Coalition to launch social media campaign\nThe Government has been urged to do more to promote the rent tax credit after new figures showed that large numbers of eligible people have failed to claim it.\nJust over 100,000 taxpayer units claimed the tax credit last year, according to figures the Department of Finance supplied to Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin.\nThis is around a third of the total estimated to be eligible.\nHowever, Finance Minister Simon Harris told Mr Ó Broin that more people who are eligible for the tax credit are likely to claim it for last year in the coming months.\nThe relief was introduced in 2022 to help tenants with the increased cost of rent. It can be claimed by filling an income tax return.\nFor 2024 to 2028, the maximum value of the rent tax credit is €2,000 a year for jointly assessed married couples or civil partners. The maximum value is €1,000 in all other cases.\nFigures supplied to Mr Ó Broin by Mr Harris show that 102,060 claims for the tax credit were filed with Revenue last year.\nThe figures are for tax units. A taxpayer unit is either an individual who is singly assessed or a couple in a marriage or civil partnership who have elected for joint assessment.\nThe number of units that have claimed the credit for last year represents a third of the 315,030 that claimed it in 2023.\nAround 400,000 people are eligible, according to previous Department of Finance figures.\nMr Harris told Mr Ó Broin some of those claiming the credit may not benefit from it, as they earn so little that their income tax credits and other deductions mean they have no tax liability.\nPeople who claim the credit can get a refund or have their tax liability reduced if they are successful in claiming it.\nTo claim it, renters have to file a tax return with Revenue in the MyAccount section of its website.\nRenters need to supply the landlord’s registration details.\nA reluctance by tenants to ask landlords for registration details and an unwillingness to file a tax return may be some of the reasons for the low number of claims.\nMr Harris said most claims for credits by PAYE taxpayers take place after the year-end, and it is expected that the bulk of claims for last year will not be made until later this year.\nIt is also disappointing that the Government failed to honour its Programme for Government commitment\nHowever, Mr Ó Broin accused the Government of not doing enough to promote awareness of the tax credit.\nThe Department of Housing and the Department of Finance should be promoting it on social media platforms and the Residential Tenancies Board should include information on how to claim the credit on its annual correspondence to all tenants when their tenancy is renewed, Mr Ó Broin said.\n“It is also disappointing that the Government failed to honour its Programme for Government commitment to increase the credit, given the very significant year-on-year increases in private rents,” he said.\nMr Ó Broin said the credit should be increased and combined with an emergency ban on rent increases to ensure the tenant gets the full value of the tax relief.",
