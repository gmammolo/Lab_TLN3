  "text": "Extreme Cold at -10°C, with Winds\nLower Feels-Like Temperature, Stay Healthy\nCold Wave Continues in Northern Gyeonggi\n[Cheonji Ilbo Gyeonggi=Kim Seojung] A cold wave warning has been issued for Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Gapyeong, and Paju in Gyeonggi Province, as extremely cold weather is expected to continue in northern Gyeonggi tomorrow (4th). The morning low temperatures in inland areas of northern Gyeonggi are forecasted to drop below -10°C, with strong winds further lowering the perceived temperatures.\nThe morning low temperatures in northern Gyeonggi are expected to range between -10°C and -5°C, while the daytime highs are forecasted to be between 3°C and 5°C. The skies will generally remain clear, although some clouds are expected to increase in the afternoon. The weather in the West Sea’s Five Islands (Seohae 5-do) will also remain partly cloudy.\nStarting early morning on the 5th, rain or snow is likely to fall in northern Gyeonggi. Significant snowfall of up to 3–8 cm is anticipated in the northwest and eastern regions of Gyeonggi, with some areas experiencing heavy, wet snow falling at a rate of 1–2 cm per hour. This will likely lead to icy roads, especially on bridges, elevated roads, and at tunnel entrances and exits, increasing the risk of accidents.\nTo ensure safety, residents are advised to prepare winter equipment for vehicles, check road conditions in advance, and use public transportation whenever possible.\nAccording to the Korea Meteorological Administration, northern Gyeonggi is expected to experience rain or snow due to an approaching trough of low pressure on the 5th. Subsequently, a cold continental high-pressure system is expected to expand, causing temperatures to plummet again significantly.\nResidents in northern Gyeonggi are strongly advised to stay informed about the latest weather updates, prepare for sudden temperature changes, and take precautions to ensure their health and safety.\n[제보하기](/jebo/)\n[costaricago@naver.com](mailto:costaricago@naver.com)\n[다른 기사 보기](/news/articleList.html?sc_area=I&sc_word=costaricago&view_type=sm)",
