  "text": "Winter Storm Watch issued for entire Cincinnati area: Heavy snow, sleet, ice all possible\nFriday’s brush with some overnight snow showers is just the first brush with winter weather as we head into the weekend.\nA Winter Storm Watch has been issued for the entire Greater Cincinnati area that will go into effect Sunday morning through Monday evening.\nFor Friday, plan on snow through 8 a.m. Around an inch of snow looks likely for most. This will likely impact the morning commute on Friday, especially on untreated roads.\nA Winter Weather Advisory is in place through Friday morning for areas that could see closer to 2 inches of snow in Fayette and Union counties in Indiana and Warren, Clinton and Highland counties in Ohio. After the snow ends around 8 a.m., it gets cold. Temperatures will be in the 20s in the afternoon but feel like the teens.\nCold and dry weather lasts Saturday. Highs feel more like the teens.\nA winter storm takes aim at Greater Cincinnati Sunday into Monday. Nailing down the track is still up in the air, but early outlooks still bring a heavy snow in Sunday around midday. At some point, a wintry mix looks possible. That brings the chance for sleet and or freezing rain, which would cut back snow totals where that happens. It's likely that we switch back to snow at some point Monday as the system moves out. Significant impacts to travel look likely, but much is to be determined (totals and timing) beyond that.\nA cold stretch settles in through the first full week of January. By Wednesday, dangerously cold wind chills struggle to make it out of the single digits.",
