  "text": "Cold mornings continue, dry weekend ahead\nSAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - It’s a cold start to our Friday morning with lows in the upper 20s to lower 30s for inland communities.\nFrost has developed as well, which might add a couple minutes to your morning commute! Sunshine returns today with temperatures warming to the mid 50s by lunchtime. This afternoon will be breezy and sunny, with gusts of 25 to 30 miles per hour possible as a front moves through. High top out near 60 degrees followed by a cool and calmer evening.\nWe’ll remain dry this weekend with lows near freezing on Saturday and Sunday morning. Highs will be in the low to mid 50s on Saturday and mid to upper 50s on Sunday. We’ll see a few more clouds on Sunday, but rain is not in the forecast.\nThe start of next week will be briefly warmer with lows in the 40s and highs in the mid to upper 60s. This comes with our next best rain chance, primarily during the daytime. Severe weather is not expected at this time, but with gusts near 30 miles per hour will be likely. Colder air filters in behind Monday’s front with widespread freezing temperatures likely midweek.\nTuesday morning will be near freezing once again with highs only near 50 degrees. Upper 20s will be widespread Wednesday, Thursday and Friday morning.\nGulf moisture and a front move closer to our region next Friday. Right now, it looks like we will remain above freezing with just rain in the forecast. There is a better chance of wintry precipitation in the northern half of Georgia.\nStay tuned for updates!\nCopyright 2025 WTOC. All rights reserved.",
