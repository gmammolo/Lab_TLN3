  "text": "Cincinnati: Winter Storm Sunday and Monday\nCincinnati: Winter Storm Sunday and Monday\nCAN MAYBE GET SOME HELP. HELPERS, YOU KNOW YOU HAVE KIDS RIGHT THERE NEAR THE DOOR. YOU KNOW, THEY’LL THINK IT’S FUN FOR SURE. TURN IT INTO A GAME. THAT’S THE KEY. EXACTLY. FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS, KEEP THEM, YOU KNOW, ENTERTAINED. THERE’S A LOT TO PROCESS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. RANDI. AND THEN AFTER ALL OF THAT REALLY COLD WEATHER. SO IT’S SOMETHING TO BE PREPARED FOR EVEN DAYS AHEAD. AND IT’S I COULD TAKE UP THE FULL HALF HOUR TALKING ABOUT HOW THINGS, HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO PROGRESS FOR US OVER THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, THREE, FOUR DAYS INTO NEXT WEEK. BUT TODAY IS A WEATHER IMPACT DAY. SUNDAY, MONDAY, OUR WEATHER ALERT DAY, AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR. RIGHT NOW, THIS IS THE CLIPPER COMING THROUGH. YOU CAN SEE FOR A LITTLE WHILE THIS MORNING THERE WAS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN MIXING IN NEAR LUNKEN AIRPORT INTO CLERMONT COUNTY. RIGHT NOW, WATCHING THE BACK EDGE OF ANY SORT OF STEADY SNOW SHOWERS MOVE ITS WAY THROUGH DOWNTOWN AND DRIFT TO THE EAST. SO OVER ON THE WEST SIDE, YOU’RE SEEING, YOU KNOW, A COUPLE OF FLURRIES STILL, BUT THE STEADIER SNOW SHOWERS RANGE FROM LOVELAND IN THROUGH TAYLOR MILL DOWN TOWARD CRITTENDON, AREAS A LITTLE BIT FURTHER TO THE NORTH, RIGHT UP 71. YOU’RE STILL FOLLOWING THOSE SNOW SHOWERS FROM LEBANON, UP INTO WILMINGTON AND SABINA. THERE WE GO. EAST. STEADY SNOW CONTINUES RIGHT ALONG ROUTE 68 AND IN THROUGH HIGHLAND COUNTY, BROWN, ADAMS COUNTIES. THESE ARE THE AREAS, ESPECIALLY TO THE EAST, WHERE YOU’RE MORE LIKELY TO SEE IT’S STARTING TO ACCUMULATE ON THE CAR, ON THE BACK DECK, THAT KIND OF THING. AS WE GO THROUGH THE MORNING, IT’S ALMOST 530. BY THE TIME WE GET TO ABOUT 7 A.M. OR SO, THOSE SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE FADING FOR EVERYBODY, AND THEN WE SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE NEXT STORM, THE WINTER STORM THAT IT FINALLY IS MAKING ITS WAY ON TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. SO YOU’VE HEARD THE CHATTER FOR DAYS WHEN IT WAS WELL OUT OVER THE OCEAN. NOW THAT WE’RE ACTUALLY ON LAND, WE CAN GET A BETTER HANDLE ON IT WITH OUR WEATHER BALLOONS, WITH OUR WEATHER MODELS, AND WE’LL BE ABLE TO GET MORE SPECIFICS ON THE TRACK OF THIS THING, BECAUSE YOU GUYS KNOW HERE IN CINCINNATI, THE TRACK IMPACTS THE TOTALS. AND IN OUR AREA, THROWING A LITTLE BIT OF WARM AIR ALOFT AND YOU GO FROM LOOKING AT SOMETHING GOING, OH, LOOK AT ALL THIS SNOW TO HEY, THERE’S SOME SNOW. BUT NOW IT’S SLEETING. SO FOR OUR AREA, WINTER STORM WATCHES ALREADY IN EFFECT. THEY GO INTO EFFECT SUNDAY MORNING AND LAST THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. HERE’S THE IMPACT TODAY. WEATHER IMPACT DAY SNOW THROUGH AROUND 7 A.M. MOST PLACES. PICKING UP A DUSTING TO MAYBE AN INCH. WE’RE WATCHING FOR SLICK SPOTS, TEMPERATURES DIVE THIS AFTERNOON. WE’RE IN THE 20S AS THIS NEXT SYSTEM MOVES IN SUNDAY AND MONDAY. OUR WEATHER ALERT DAYS. A WINTER STORM IS MOVING IN SIGNIFICANT SNOW AND SOME POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET, WHICH I’M JUST GOING TO LUMP IN UNDER THE TERM ICE. THEN AFTER IT THE REST OF NEXT WEEK. DANGEROUS COLD ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS, IT’S GOING TO FEEL LIKE ZERO OR EVEN BELOW ZERO FOR SEVERAL DAYS. TODAY, EARLY MORNING SNOW SHOWERS MOVING OUT. YOU CAN SEE BY 7:38 A.M. THE SNOW IS OUT OF HERE. MAYBE A COUPLE OF FLURRIES UP THROUGH ABOUT NOON OR SO. ONCE WE GET INTO THE AFTERNOON. MIGHT EVEN TRY TO SEE A LITTLE SUNSHINE PEEK OUT BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN. TOMORROW IS OUR BREATHER. IT’S A COLD DAY, BUT WE’LL SEE SOME SUNSHINE AND WILL BE IN THE 20S. AND AS WE GET ON INTO SUNDAY MORNING EARLY ON, THINGS ARE DRY. YOU’VE PROBABLY GOT UP UNTIL ABOUT NOON, UNTIL THE SNOW SHOWERS MOVE IN ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THIS THING. IT DOES LOOK LIKE ALL SNOW. SEVERAL HOURS OF STEADY SNOW FROM ABOUT NOON TO 8 P.M. WE’VE GOT STEADY SNOW SHOWERS. IT’S PILING UP AT TIMES, MAYBE ALMOST AN INCH AN HOUR. WE GET INTO SUNDAY EVENING CLOSER TO 8 OR 9 P.M., LOOK TO THE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE 20S, BUT ALOFT WILL HAVE SOME WARM AIR. THAT MEANS FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET STARTS TO MIX IN, AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO NAIL DOWN OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO IS HOW FAR NORTH THAT MIXING LINE GETS. DOES IT JUST GET TO THE RIVER, OR DOES IT GET ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH? THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY IMPACT YOUR EVENTUAL SNOWFALL TOTALS, BECAUSE YOU’LL HAVE SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW, BUT THEN SLEET AND ICE ON TOP OF IT THAT COMPACTS THINGS. AND ON THE BACK SIDE OF THINGS. ON MONDAY MORNING, BY 8 A.M., WE’RE BACK TO ALL SNOW. SO IT’S SNOW POTENTIAL FOR ICE FOR SOME MORE SNOW. SO WINTER STORM TIMELINE SUNDAY, NOON THROUGH 8 P.M. ALL SNOW. YOU’RE GOING TO BUST OUT THE SHOVELS OVERNIGHT SUNDAY. ICE OR SLEET MIXED IN FROM SOUTH TO NORTH, AND IT ENDS WITH A COUPLE MORE INCHES OF SNOW UP THROUGH ABOUT NOON ON MONDAY. SO THAT’S WHY YOU’RE SEEING THE RED PANELS AND THE FLASHING ICONS. SUNDAY AND MONDAY ARE WEATHER ALERT DAYS, AND OF COURSE WE WILL FINE TUNE THE SPECIFIC TIMELINE AND GIVE IT ANOTHER 12 HOURS OR SO. WE WILL TALK A LITTLE MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE TOTALS OF SNOWFALL. THAT’S WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW. BUT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE REAL FOR YOU. FOR TRAVEL SUNDAY AND MONDAY. ALL RIGHT. RANDI A LOT TO PROCESS THERE. WE APPRECIATE IT.
