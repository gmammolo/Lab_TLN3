  "text": "Environment Canada has warned residents of several regions of Quebec to avoid hitting the roads on Friday as episodes of snow will be scattered across the province.\nUntil Friday morning, the Granby, Brome and Mont-Orford sectors should expect to receive up to 10 additional centimeters of heavy snow and blowing snow, according to a warning from the federal agency.\nAt the same time, Saguenay, the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve and certain locations on Lake Saint-Jean could see an accumulation of between 10 and 15 cm of snow on the ground during the same period.\n“Strong westerly winds combined with snow could reduce visibility to almost zero in places […] Evaluate the possibility of bringing forward or delaying any non-essential travel,” Environment Canada said on its website Friday.\nIn the James Bay and La Grande River area, “dangerous winter conditions” are even forecast, with a winter storm carrying 20 to 30 cm of snow expected to begin Friday night and continue Saturday.\nThis will be accompanied by gusts from the northwest, blowing blowing snow up to a speed of 90 km/h, according to the weather site.\nFor its part, western Quebec, including Montreal, Saint-Jérôme, Lanaudière and the Laurentians, will not be left out with a 40% probability of snow from Friday afternoon under cloudy skies, with temperatures of -5 degrees accompanied by a wind chill of -15.\nSame story in central Quebec, while the National Capital can expect intermittent light snow ending in the morning, with a few episodes of blowing snow in places.\nFor its part, Estrie could see the accumulation of snow on the ground continue during the day Friday, causing the white carpet to rise by 2 to 4 cm.",
