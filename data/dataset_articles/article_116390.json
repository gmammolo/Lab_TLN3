  "text": "The harsh winter chill has tightened its grip on north India, including Delhi, with dense fog blanketing the region and temperatures plunging further.\nIn Delhi, Friday morning began with a minimum temperature of 9.6°C—marking the fifth consecutive cold day. Visibility dropped to near zero in parts of the capital, disrupting travel and daily routines.\nAt Delhi’s Palam Airport, visibility fell to zero, while Safdarjung Airport reported just 50 metres. Although commercial flights continued operating, airlines like SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Air India faced delays. Passengers reported average hold-ups of 5–11 minutes, and some flights to Amritsar and Guwahati were significantly disrupted.\nAmid the prevailing dense fog conditions, Delhi airport authorities on Friday issued an advisory and stated that flights that were not CAT III compliant would be affected.\nTaking to social media X, the authority wrote in a post “While landing and take-offs continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected.”\nFurther, the airport authorities requested passengers to contact the concerned airlines for their updated flight information.\n“Passengers are requested to contact the airline concerned for updated flight information,” the post reads further.\nInconveniences caused to passengers were regretted.\n“Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted,” the post further read.\nTrains were no exception. Over two dozen trains departing from Delhi were delayed due to poor visibility, including the Ayodhya Express, which was four hours late, and the Gorakhdham Express, running two hours behind schedule.\nThe cold wave extended its grip across northern states. Lucknow woke up to a chilly 8°C, while Jaipur recorded 10.2°C. In Srinagar, the temperature dipped to -1.3°C, with snowfall disrupting air travel.\nThe fog wasn’t the only issue—Delhi’s air quality deteriorated further, with an AQI of 348, categorised as ‘very poor.’ The choking smog added another layer of discomfort for residents already battling the biting cold.\nThe IMD has predicted dense fog until January 8 in Delhi, with a chance of light rain on January 6, which may bring slight relief. In the meantime, authorities continue to urge travellers to check updates on flights and trains while preparing for potential delays.",
