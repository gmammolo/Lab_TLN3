One important such topic is children’s use of smartphones in schools.\nThe research is clear: Smartphones undermine attention, learning, relationships and belonging. Even if every school prohibits children’s access to social media while at school, that will not significantly reduce the adverse impact to their brains; their social, emotional and cognitive development; and their learning ability. For more details, see Jon Haidt’s essay here: www.afterbabel.com/p/phone-free-schools .\nAnother issue of concern for today’s children is “climate change anxiety” or “eco-anxiety,” which the American Psychological Association recognizes as a significant mental health concern in children. As they become aware of the effects of climate change, many kids feel fear, hopelessness and distress about the future of the planet. This may drive them to seek escape via social media — which creates other issues, as noted above. To help relieve these feelings in young children, I recommend the book “Small Steps, Big Change” by Annemarie Cool, illustrated by James Jones. It is an uplifting picture book filled with simple tips for building a better world for the future. Every family should have a copy!\nAnother concern for pets and young people alike: The rates of obesity and weight-related diseases are rising in both pets and children in the U.S. This has many factors, including genetics, sedentarism, ultra-processed foods and, possibly, microplastics and various other food contaminants disrupting the gut microbiome. Healthful, whole-food diets and physical activity are the best preventives for everyone, human or not!\nA GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR BATS — AND A WARNING FOR US ALL\nResearchers are studying the fungi and bacteria on the wings of bats in Lillooet, British Columbia, because bats in that region have shown no signs of infection from the devastating white-nose syndrome that has nearly wiped out other North American bat populations. The research may lead to a probiotic cocktail that helps bats resist the devastating disease. A previously developed probiotic mix has shown promise at test sites in Washington state and British Columbia. (Full story: Phys.org , Oct. 23)\nBats help us in many ways — from consuming insects that can carry diseases and decimate crops, to fertilizing the forests. (They also fertilize the agave plants that give us tequila — no bats, no tequila!) But bats are declining everywhere from loss of habitat, malnutrition (from insecticides eliminating their food sources) and immune system impairment from pesticides. The latter makes them susceptible to diseases, especially white-nose syndrome.\nInternational conventions on protecting biodiversity will amount to nothing without prohibiting the use of agrichemical poisons. Every government should support farmers transitioning to ecologically sound, regenerative and sustainable organic farming practices. This would improve public health and reduce the high incidence of cancer and birth defects in the populace and protect aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.\nDEAR DR. FOX: There is a lot of research being conducted now on the sentience of insects. I’ve done some reading and attended a few talks on the subject. While there is a wide spectrum of opinion on this, in my naive view, there is a difference between using black soldier fly larvae as a protein source and using crickets. I believe crickets are quite possibly sentient. — P.S., San Francisco\nDEAR P.S.: I appreciate your concern over whether insect farming, which is expanding worldwide, is humane. Humans have been eating wild insects as a sustainable source of various nutrients since we first evolved. As for our companion animals, many cats (and some dogs) will chase and eat bugs found in the home. I advise stopping them from going after spiders, since some are venomous; these should be caught and released outdoors.\nBlack soldier fly larvae provide nutritious fatty acids and proteins, and can be humanely killed, in my opinion, by lowering the temperature. They are a good nutrient supplement for humans and companion animals.\nAdult crickets are obviously sentient — try to catch one! — and their primary nutrient value is chitin. An alternative source is chitin-rich dried, powdered mushrooms, which I have mentioned in a recent column.\nFor consumers who choose to consume farmed insects, whatever the insect larvae and adults are fed should be organically certified and tested for heavy metals and other contaminants.\n(Send all mail to animaldocfox@gmail.com or to Dr. Michael Fox in care of Andrews McMeel Syndication, 1130 Walnut St., Kansas City, MO 64106.
