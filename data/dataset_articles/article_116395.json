  "text": "By Jonah Chester jchester@postandcourier.com Jonah Chester\nJonah Chester covers flooding, sea level rise and climate change for the Post and Courier's Rising Waters Lab.\nAuthor email Jan 3, 2025 7 mins ago Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Buy Now Kids run across Hagood Avenue during a king tide Sept. 20, 2024, in Charleston as high tide reaches its peak. Tide levels at the Charleston Harbor Tide Gauge reached 7.74 feet, signifying a \"moderate\" flood stage. Charleston experienced about 11 such floods in 2024.\nFile/Andrew Whitaker/Staff Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Charleston Harbor hit a flood stage 54 times in 2024. By the numbers, it was the calmest year for flooding in the Holy City since 2021. But it was one of the most active years since record-keeping began 100 years ago.\nSpecifically, 2024 took home seventh place on the National Weather Service's Coastal Flood Events Database .\nAs ocean levels near Charleston have risen about a foot over the past century, the number of tidal floods (also called \"sunny day floods\") has increased. Charleston experienced more tidal floods last year than it did in the entire period from late 1921 to 1958.\nDonate to our Investigative Fund to support journalism like this Our public service and investigative reporting is among the most important work we do. It's also the most expensive reporting we do. We can't do it without your support.\nDonate Now Water levels are likely to rise another foot-plus over the next 25 years, and city leaders point to the steady uptick in flooding as one of Charleston's greatest existential threats. As ocean levels rise, the frequency and severity of those tidal floods will increase. By 2050, Charleston could experience as many as 170 flood events per year, or about one every other day, according to Charleston's recently released Water Plan.\nThe harbor is considered in \"flood stage\" whenever it hits 7 feet or higher. Those stages are broken into three categories.\n\"Minor\" begins at 7 feet, and it's the most frequent. These are typically nuisance floods that create large puddles, make the commute to and from work a bit tricky and may result in some light hydroplaning. \"Moderate\" begins at 7.5 feet, and at that point roads start closing down, lower-lying areas are inundated and residents can count on migraine-inducing traffic jams. \"Major\" floods occur at 8 feet or higher. Those are the washouts that swamp downtown, and essentially shut down the peninsula.\n\"Over 71 percent of all major tidal floods have occurred in the last nine years,\" Jared Bramblett, a senior water resources engineer at Moffatt & Nichol and one of the Water Plan's creators, said at a City Council meeting on the Water Plan in August.\nBuy Now A truck moves through floodwaters in the intersection of Fishburne Street and Hagood Avenue during a king tide Sept. 20, 2024, in Charleston. The area is one of the lowest-lying in the city, and floods regularly.\nFile/Andrew Whitaker/Staff Charleston experienced three of those major floods last year. According to Charleston's Water Plan, the city could see nearly 30 such washouts annually by 2050 — or one roughly every two weeks.",
