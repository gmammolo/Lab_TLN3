  "text": "As winter tightens its grip on Bangladesh, biting cold and dense fog are taking a toll, particularly on children, the elderly, and outdoor workers. The chill is particularly severe in the northern regions, with Tetulia in Panchagarh district recording the lowest temperature of 8.3°C at 9am today (3 January), according to Md Rokanuzzaman, an observer at the Tetulia Weather Observatory Centre. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) issued a forecast of a mild cold wave sweeping across the northern region, including Rangpur, Rajshahi, Pabna, Bogura, Naogaon, and Kushtia. In Dhaka, with temperatures dipping and no sun in sight throughout the day, residents endured cold winds and damp roads. Despite it being a weekly holiday, few people ventured outside. Vehicles were seen driving with headlights on, and the damp roads remained wet with dew throughout the day. The meteorological office in a notice today said the ongoing weather conditions will continue for the next few days but the day and night temperatures will rise slightly till tomorrow evening. During this time, dense fog will remain across the country from midnight till the morning, which may hamper air, riverine and road transport, the notice said. The minimum temperature recorded in the capital was 13.6°C and maximum was 17.5°C in 24 hours till 6pm today. Hospitals under pressure Due to the cold, the crowd of people suffering from cold-related diseases has increased in hospitals across the country. Doctors say the surge in cold-related illness this year to the sudden drop in temperature, which has caused an increase in the number of such cases twice or thrice, reports BSS.\nMild cold wave sweeping over country's northern part Unfortunately, many parents bring their children to the hospital after initially self-medicating from local pharmacies, which only worsen their health complications, said the doctors. Dr Rabeya Sultana, a physician of Maternal and Child Health Training Institute, explained that the combination of winter and air pollution have posed significant health hazards for children. The number of cold-related illnesses among patients is especially high, with many children currently hospitalised due to pneumonia. As the cold intensifies, the number of such patients is expected to rise, she observed. Director of Bangladesh Shishu Hospital and Institute Dr Mahbubul Alam said winter increases the risk of diarrhea among children, as they tend to drink less water compared to the summer months. He advised ensuring that children stay hydrated during winter along with recommending adults with fever, cold, or cough to wear masks at home to prevent infecting children. Agriculture impacted The Department of Agricultural Extension has issued a special alert to protect potato fields and Boro paddy seedbeds, reports UNB. Masudur Rahman Sarkar, deputy director of the district's DAE, said the paddy seedbed should be irrigated in the afternoon and drained out the next morning. Moreover, remove the dew from the seedlings in the morning, if possible, cover it at night, he said.\nFoggy weather prevails in Dhaka as cold wave continues Farmers have been advised to spray fungicides in potato fields so that they do not get fungus in advance. Officials of the Agriculture Department are performing their duties carefully at the field level to oversee the overall affairs. Railway caution Bangladesh Railway has issued a heightened alert to prevent accidents on the tracks. Railway crossing staff have been urged to fulfill their duties with extra care, and pedestrians at unprotected crossings are advised to stay vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement near the tracks. Officials have warned that the reduced visibility caused by the fog may disrupt train operations and increase the risk of accidents.",
