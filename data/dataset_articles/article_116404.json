  "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 11:13 AM UTC\nTurkiye: Adverse weather forecast across western regions through at least Jan. 5\nSevere weather forecast across western Turkiye through at least Jan. 5. Flooding and associated disruptions possible.\nSevere weather is forecast across parts of western Turkiye through at least Jan. 5. Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms are expected across Aydin, Izmir, and Mugla provinces over the coming days; strong wind gusts, lightning, localized hail, and possible tornadoes may accompany storms. Rainfall totals of over 10 cm (4 inches) are possible in parts of Mugla Province through early Jan. 5. Heavy downpours may trigger flooding in low-lying areas and strong winds could cause property damage and power outages.\nThe Turkish State Meteorological Service has issued orange thunderstorm warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale) for Mugla Province Jan. 3-4 and yellow thunderstorm warnings for Izmir Province Jan. 3-4 and Aydin Province Jan. 4. Authorities will likely issue new alerts or update/rescind existing advisories as weather conditions change over the coming hours and days.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. Landslides are possible in hilly or mountainous areas, especially where heavy rain has saturated the soil.\nAuthorities could issue mandatory evacuation orders for flood-prone communities over the coming days. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant flooding or landslides impact utility networks.\nFloodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas with heavy rainfall and potential track inundation.\nLocalized business disruptions may occur in low-lying areas; some businesses might not operate at full capacity because of flood damage to facilities, possible evacuations, and some employees' inability to reach work sites.\nMonitor local media for updated emergency and weather information. Seek updated information on weather and road conditions before driving or routing shipments through areas where severe weather is forecast. Plan accordingly for potential delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Do not attempt to drive through flooded areas. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",
