  "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 10:35 AM UTC\nAfghanistan: Adverse weather forecast across central and eastern regions through at least Jan. 6\nSevere weather forecast across central and eastern Afghanistan through at least Jan. 6. Road closures ongoing due to heavy snowfall.\nAdverse weather is forecast across central and eastern Afghanistan through at least Jan. 6. The Meteorology Department of the Ministry of Transport and Aviation has issued a warning for heavy snowfall, heavy rainfall, and strong winds across Kandahar, Zabul, Uruzgan, Ghor, Sar-e-Pol, Bamyan, Daykundi, Paktika, Ghazni, Paktia, Khost, Logar, Wardak, Samangan, Balkh, Kunduz, Baghlan, Parwan, Kabul, Panjshir, Nuristan, Takhar, Badakhshan, Kapisa, Nangarhar, Laghman, and Kunar provinces Jan. 3-4. Rainfall totals of 1.5-4 cm (0.6-1.6 inches) and snowfall accumulations of 10-40 cm (4-16 inches) are expected across the affected area. Strong winds gusting up to 100 kph (62 mph) are also forecast in central and northeastern provinces. Further precipitation is expected across the region Jan. 5-6. Several roads in the region are closed following heavy snowfall in recent days, including the Salang Pass linking northern Afghanistan to Parwan and Kabul provinces and sections of the Kabul-Bamyan Highway.\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flooding in low-lying communities near rivers, streams, and creeks. Urban flooding is also possible in developed areas with easily overwhelmed or a lack of stormwater drainage systems. Sites located downstream from large reservoirs or rivers may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall.\nPrecipitation could fall as snow in the higher elevations over the coming days. Wind gusts could cause blowing and drifting snow; decreased visibility is likely in mountainous areas. Rain-induced landslides cannot be discounted in areas of elevated terrain; there is also the possibility of avalanches in mountainous areas where the snowpack has become unstable due to heavy snowfall. Disruptions to electricity and telecommunications services are possible where significant winds, flooding, or landslides impact utility networks.\nFloodwaters and debris flows may render some bridges, railways, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around affected areas. Ponding on road surfaces could cause hazardous driving conditions on regional highways. Authorities could temporarily close some low-lying routes that become inundated by floodwaters. Heavy snow will likely make driving hazardous in some areas; authorities could implement further temporary road closures or detours in such locations. Mountain passes and tunnels could be closed as a precautionary measure during periods of intense snowfall. Severe weather could also trigger flight delays and cancellations at regional airports.\nMonitor local media for weather updates and related advisories. Confirm all transport reservations and business appointments before travel. Make allowances for localized travel delays and potential supply chain disruptions where flooding has been forecast. Do not drive on flooded roads. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",
