The decision by Tehran affects flights throughout Asia and Europe, as airlines warned customers traveling through the region to expect delays and schedule changes.\nDue to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. Some Air India flights where…\n— Air India (@airindia)\n[January 15, 2026]\nIndian carriers Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet alerted passengers who would be affected by the flight changes to avoid Iran’s airspace to prepare for long delays or cancellations. Air India confirmed that flights unable to reroute would be cancelled. Customers were advised to monitor live updates to their flights and offered waivers on flight change fees should they need to cancel or reroute flights.\nTravel Advisory\nDue to the sudden airspace closure by Iran, some of our international flights are impacted. Our teams are working diligently to assess the situation and support affected customers by offering the best possible alternatives.\nThis development is beyond our…\n— IndiGo (@IndiGo6E)\n[January 14, 2026]\nFlight trackers saw commercial traffic suspended from Iran airspace early Thursday. Only a few flights with special permission were allowed through by Iran officials. The country reopened its airspace to flights several hours later and traffic resumed, though it left numerous flights between Asia and Europe suspended.\nIranian authorities briefly banned flights from its airspace amid heightened tensions with the U.S. and ongoing anti-government protests at home. India’s Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet airlines all alerted customers about flight cancellations and delays due to the flight ban.\nOnly a few flights with special permission from Iranian authorities were allowed through while the ban was in place. Iran eventually reopened its airspace to regular traffic several hours later. Officials did not say how long the ban would last or give a reason for the shutdown.\nThe order forced airlines to cancel flights and or arrange for costly flight reroutes. Airlines advise customers traveling through Iran to brace for delays\nAir India, Indigo, and SpiceJet Airlines are advising customers that flights transiting through Iranian airspace could be significantly delayed or cancelled. Passengers are encouraged to check their flight’s real-time status and book an alternate flight if their flight is cancelled. Both airlines are waiving flight change fees for affected customers.\nFlights heading to or from Iran have been cancelled and redirected as Iranian airspace has been closed. Several airlines have notified customers who will be affected by this decision to expect delays.\nIraq’s airspace also avoids Iran amid tensions with the United States. Several airlines have already rerouted flights to avoid Iraqi airspace. Iraq stopped flying to Iran earlier this week as a safety precaution to airline crews and passengers after the U.S. issued a notice to airmen.\nThe U.S. issued a notice to airlines last Friday warning about flight restrictions through Iraqi airspace and Iran. Both Germany and the U.S. warned airlines and crews to not travel through certain airspaces in Iraq and Iran.\nProtests erupted throughout Iran earlier this month after a government crackdown on citizens. The ongoing protests have caused tension between Iran and the United States.\nIran briefly banned flights through its airspace amid heightened tensions with the U.S. over protests that have gripped the country for weeks. Tensions have also increased between Iranian officials and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIranian airspace is often used to route flights between Asia and Europe so its closure caused delays for passengers throughout those two continents. Some carriers have elected to stop flying to Iran indefinitely while tensions continue to boil between the country and the U.S.\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.
