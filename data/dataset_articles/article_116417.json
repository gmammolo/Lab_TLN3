  "text": "2025 has got off to a chilly start, with temperatures plunging during the first week of January.\nIn response to the freezing temperatures, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber cold-health alert (CHA) for all areas of England, indicating that the health service is expected to be under increased pressure due to adverse weather conditions. In addition to the cold-health alerts, weather warnings for snow and ice are in place for large areas of the UK.\nCommenting on the alert, Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nDan Holley, Deputy Chief Forecaster for the Met Office said: “We’ve currently issued a Yellow warning for snow and ice covering a large part of England and all of Wales to cater for possible disruption over the weekend. A separate yellow warning for snow has been issued for most of Scotland.”\nThe amber cold-health alert is currently in place up until midday on Wednesday 8th of January 2025.",
