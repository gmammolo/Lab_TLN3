  "text": "Winter Weather: Cold & Gusty\nChilly weekend ahead\n- Below-freezing temperatures through next week\n- Dangerous travel if your heading south\n- No snow on the horizon\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Flurries and light snow showers will persist through mid-morning across southern Wisconsin, tapering off by late morning. Accumulation is minimal, with a dusting at most expected, and gusty northwest winds, reaching up to 25 mph, will likely blow away any light snow. Temperatures will hover in the upper teens to low 20s, but brisk winds will make it feel much colder, with wind chills remaining in the single digits. Skies will stay mostly cloudy through the afternoon, with gradual clearing expected later in the day and into the evening.\nDespite the light snow, roads across the region should remain in good condition, with little to no significant accumulation expected. However, high winds could create brief visibility issues, especially in open areas. For those driving or spending time outdoors, the biting wind will make it feel considerably colder, so warm layers and proper winter gear are essential.\nWhat comes next...\nSaturday brings a mix of sunshine and clouds as Arctic high pressure moves into the area. While the day will feel brighter, temperatures will struggle to climb above the upper teens, and northwest winds will keep the wind chill in the single digits. Outdoor enthusiasts should prepare for frigid conditions, especially during early morning hours when lows could dip into the single digits or even below zero in some spots. Sunday starts off dry but cloudier as a storm system passes south of the region. Although Wisconsin is unlikely to see snow from this system, the increase in cloud cover will make it feel gloomier. Temperatures will remain cold, with highs in the upper teens to low 20s.\nLooking ahead...\nEarly Monday morning, southeastern Wisconsin may see a quick burst of lake-effect snow as northeasterly winds develop on the backside of the departing storm system. Any snow will likely be localized and light but could create slippery conditions for the morning commute. The rest of the week looks dry but bitterly cold, with highs struggling to rise above the teens and lows frequently dipping into the single digits or lower. Brisk northwest winds will persist, keeping wind chills near or below zero, and occasional flurries may drift through the area under cloudy skies.\n[Click here](https://www.nbc15.com/page/find-nbc15-news-wherever-you-are/) to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2022 WMTV.
