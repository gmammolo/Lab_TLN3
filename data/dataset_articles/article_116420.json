  "text": "In anticipation of a significant winter storm predicted to hit the region Sunday through Monday, Transylvania University is prioritizing student safety by offering an early return option for residential students.\n“A [hazardous weather outlook](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=38.052274&lon=-84.4955722) has been issued for our region, and we expect this storm system to have a major impact,” said Michael Covert, vice president for student life and dean of students. “We understand that travel during winter weather can be unpredictable and challenging. This early return option provides our students with the flexibility to make the best decisions for their individual circumstances and prioritize their safety.”\nTransylvania will open residence halls for students to return to campus as early as Friday at noon and continuing Saturday.\nThe university advises caution for those arriving Sunday, as facilities crews will be working diligently to clear parking lots and sidewalks. Although some areas may not be fully cleared until after the storm passes, the university will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates as needed. Any changes to campus operations or schedules will be communicated according to the closing and schedule delay policy.\n“We encourage everyone to monitor weather reports closely and prioritize safety in all travel plans,” Covert added. Keep up to date with the [National Weather Service](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=38.052274&lon=-84.4955722) and local media outlets.\nThe university will make every effort to post closing or delay announcements by 6 a.m. Monday on [transy.edu](http://www.transy.edu/), [inside.transy.edu](https://inside.transy.edu/) and the university’s main social media channels. Announcements will also be sent out through the university’s T-Alert system and to local media outlets.",
