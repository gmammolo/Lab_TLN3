  "text": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - As of 3:30 a.m., snow showers are rolling in but the 'core' of the snow that will have an impact on roads is still located from Parkersburg, West Virginia up through Columbus.\nWEATHER LINKS:\nCurrent Conditions | School Closings & Delays | Submit Your Weather Photos\nThe biggest impact of snow on the morning commute will be felt south of Pittsburgh for people living along I-70. These communities may see up to 2\" falling before noon.\nPittsburgh totals will likely be around 1.5\" through noon. Once school is letting out the best chance for snow will shift with snow squalls being heaviest north of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. While snow totals will be all over the place depending on who sees the brunt of snow squalls, an additional 2\"-3\" of snow will be possible overnight for places like New Castle and Oil City bringing their 24-hour snow totals close to 4\"-5\" of snow.\nThe highest totals will be recorded in westward-facing slopes of the Ridges and Laurel Highlands where 24-hour snow totals should hit 6\"-8\". It should be an outstanding weekend for skiers at the ski resorts.\nEnjoy!\nMorning snow showers will have the biggest impact on roads from Pittsburgh to the south especially for places along and just south of I-70. From afternoon to evening, impacts will switch to places in the north.\nDue to the weather, we have issued a First Alert Weather Day for the area through tomorrow morning.\nWe have a 3rd First Alert Weather Day (the first two occurring today and Saturday) in place for Monday.\nMonday is going to be a mess no matter what, but the biggest question I have right now is how far north warm ahead of the front pushes. The GFS model has the push of this warm air far enough that we see several hours of mixed precipitation.\nIt still shows snow totals being in the winter storm warning range, meaning more than 6\" of snow falling. The EURO model keeps the event as all snow and obviously means some really big totals are being shown there. We will keep you up to date with the latest on what data is showing and what you should expect over the weekend.\nGetting back to this weekend, impactful snow comes to an end Saturday morning. Most will see the impactful stuff done before sunrise, but some lake effect snow showers and a squall or two will still be possible up to nearly noon on Saturday morning. Saturday will be windy and cold with high temperatures in the mid-20s.\nSunday won't be as cold with highs in the upper 20s.\nStay up to date with the KDKA Mobile App – which you can download here!\nMore from CBS News Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas to see accumulating snow on Friday morning The Pittsburgh area will see snow showers today with heavy accumulations in the Laurel Highlands and ridges Heavy snow accumulation is starting to blanket parts of the Pittsburgh area It's going to be a rainy New Year's Eve in the Pittsburgh area Who could the Steelers play in the first round of the NFL Playoffs?
