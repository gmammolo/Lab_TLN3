  "text": "• Updated 35 mins ago NBC Universal, Inc. The wind isn't nearly as fierce Friday as it was Thursday, but we still have occasional gusts to 40 mph through the afternoon. Unfortunately, there is more wind Saturday with gusts to 35mph… And on Sunday, too.\nWATCH ANYTIME FOR FREE\n>Stream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\nIf we're pointing fingers, blame can be squarely placed on a stalled storm over the Maritimes. Air circulating around the storm will keep us in the gusts through the weekend, with a drop off expected by Monday.\nGet updates on what's happening in Boston to your inbox. Sign up for our >News Headlines newsletter. Unfortunately, this may be only for a day, as another storm (that will grab a lot of headlines) moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast and reinvigorates the wind over us.\nWind chills remain in the 20s Friday, but dive into the teens Saturday as the temperatures step down to the low 30s. The upcoming pattern promises we will stay in the low 30s (cold, but not bitterly so) throughout next week.\nWe'll get sideline tickets to the big storm sliding through the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic states on Monday. Some spots could get nearly 8\" in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. We'll merely see the clouds increase in response to the storm.\nLocal In-depth news coverage of the Greater Boston Area.\nPatriots 4 mins ago Patriots ‘100% focused' on beating Bills Sunday, coach Jerod Mayo says Nashua 7 hours ago NH man accused of trying to take gun from Nashua police officer Any ice forming this weekend (other than backyard rinks) will NOT be safe.
