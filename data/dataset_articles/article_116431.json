  "text": "NORTHWEST CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN - A period of very cold wind chills is expected with overnight lows near -32, says Environment Canada.\nCombined with light southeasterly winds will result in extreme windchill values below minus 40 Celsius early Friday morning. Temperatures will gradually improve later Friday morning, but extreme cold values may return in some areas Friday night.\nExtreme cold puts everyone at risk. Dress warmly. Dress in layers that you can remove if you get too warm. The outer layer should be wind resistant. Cover up. Frostbite can develop within minutes on exposed skin, especially with wind chill.\nIf it’s too cold for you to stay outside, it’s too cold for your pet to stay outside.\nOutdoor workers should take regularly scheduled breaks to warm up.",
