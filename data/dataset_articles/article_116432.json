  "text": "FIRST ALERT: Snowy hazards in parts of the Western and Eastern UP; chilly northwest winds\nOccasionally heavy lake effect snow to affect areas in the western and eastern counties -- slippery hazards, poor visibilities.\nNWS alerts in effect [HERE](https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/weather/alerts/).\nThe new year begins on a cold, snowy trend in Upper Michigan, as strengthening high pressure from the Prairie Provinces of Canada brings frigid polar air to the region. Moderate to heavy snowfall, poor driving visibility from blowing snow are all possible hazards for the northwest wind belts this week, mainly along and north of M-28 in the Western and Eastern U.P. until the lake effect snow machine gradually dwindles this weekend.\nLake effect snow recharges early next week as another cold polar high system emerges from the Canadian Prairies -- impacting the north wind belts and elevating chances of accumulating snow for areas with shrinking snow depth such as Marquette.\nTonight: Mostly cloudy with lake effect snow in the northwest wind belts; heavy bursts of snow possible northwest and east; blustery\n>Lows: Lower 20s to Lower 30s (colder inland)\nFriday: Partly to mostly cloudy with light to moderate lake effect snow in the northwest wind belts; patchy blowing snow; windy and colder\n>Highs: 10s/20\nSaturday and Sunday: Partly to mostly cloudy with light lake effect snow in the northwest wind belts, mainly east; windy and cold\n>Highs: 10s\nMonday: Mostly cloudy with lake effect snow in the north wind belts; windy and cold\n>Highs: 20\nTuesday and Wednesday: Mostly cloudy with scattered snow; windy and cold; morning wind chills of -25 possible\n>Highs: 10s/20\nThursday: Scattered clouds with snow tapering east; blustery\n>Highs: 20\nCopyright 2025 WLUC.
