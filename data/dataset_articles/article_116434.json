The polar vortex is a large area of low-pressure and cold air that typically swirls around the Earth's poles, particularly the North Pole. unbranded - Newsworthy It might finally be time to drip faucets and bundle up as an arctic cold front makes its way to Oklahoma.\nThe first cold snap of 2025 will arrive Saturday night or Sunday, according to the National Weather Service in Norman . Forecasters aren't yet sure whether central Oklahoma will get wintry precipitation, but there is a better chance for snow in Kansas and far northern Oklahoma.\nOklahoma's cold season has been dampened so far by the La Niña weather pattern that creates a warmer and drier winter in this part of the country.\nBelow-normal temperatures arrive Sunday While nighttime temps have recently dipped below freezing, this cold front will be different.\nStarting Sunday evening, the air temperature will reach into the teens for the foreseeable future. The daily high temp in Oklahoma City will hover around the freezing mark. Both are below the seasonal average.\nMuch colder air is expected to pour into the region on Sunday resulting in steady/falling temperatures through the day. By Monday morning, wind chills will be in the single digits and teens. Time to dust off that winter clothing. #okwx #texomawx pic.twitter.com/nlDsZ8bGDE\n— NWS Norman (@NWSNorman) January 2, 2025 There is a chance for rain on Sunday before the cold front arrives. The forecast released Thursday morning indicates that snow will be possible in northern Oklahoma, with the potential for a light accumulations of snow. Other parts of the state could see rain showers.\nHow long will the cold snap last? The latest forecast issued Thursday morning says there is a wide variation in the computer models used to predict long-term weather.\nLow temperatures are still expected to be in the teens and low 20s through Tuesday, with highs reaching in the 40s. However, a few other shots of cold air could slow Oklahoma's chances of warming up, the forecast noted.\nThis cold snap will be the coldest so far this winter season and the coldest overnight temperatures the Oklahoma City area has seen in nearly a year. The last time the temp dropped below 20 was in mid-January 2024, according to the Oklahoma Mesonet .\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
