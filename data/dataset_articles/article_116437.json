  "text": "The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for snow covering much of the North East and North Yorkshire for this weekend.It is in force from 9pm on Saturday night, until 11.59pm on Sunday night, and affects mainly inland areas of the region, including much of Northumberland, County Durham and North Yorkshire.Amber warnings mean there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to life and property.Meanwhile, a less severe yellow weather warning for snow and ice covers Newcastle, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, and more coastal areas. Forecasters say snow will begin in the south on Saturday, then spread north across the rest of the area through Sunday morning. It will be persistent and heavy at times, and will likely drift in brisk easterly winds, especially over higher ground. Much of the warning area can expect 3-7cm of snow. Areas above 150m will likely see 15-30cm, with 40cm for ground above 300m, before snow begins to ease and clear by the end of Sunday. The Met Office says travel during Saturday night and Sunday is likely to be difficult, with their advice being to avoid driving in snowy and icy conditions if possible.They advise those who do need to drive to accelerate gently, use low revs and change to higher gears as quickly as possible, keep a distance from other vehicles, and avoid slamming on brakes.The cold weather also brings with it the possibility of power cuts, with experts suggesting people could prepare by gathering torches and batteries, mobile phone power packs and other essential items.
