  "text": "After a warm stretch for the Bay State that saw temperatures climb into the 50s, a new weather system is set to pull temperatures below normal beginning Friday night.\nAlready, temperatures are expected to fall about five to 10 degrees on Friday, with highs of 39, 35 and 37 projected in Boston, Worcester and Springfield, respectively. Those relatively normal temperatures are set to give way to a stretch of much colder weather, with projected highs in the low 30s and high 20s.\n“This could end up being the coldest January since 2011 for the U.S. as a whole,” AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok said.\nAnd while temperatures are set to fall, forecasters say there is little chance of snow and ice in southern New England.\nA winter storm is set to pass south of the region Monday, with a small chance for some flakes in southern parts of Massachusetts. But forecasters say the chance of more than an inch of snow is less than 20%, with the chances decreasing in northern areas.\nAfter Monday, there is a chance for some ocean effect snow showers on Cape Cod and the Islands Tuesday but little chance of precipitation for the rest of the Bay State, which will see continued cold and dry conditions.\nMore News Mass.
