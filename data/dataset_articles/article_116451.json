  "text": "An amber weather warning for snow and ice for most of Wales has been issued for this weekend by the Met Office.\nIt is the second highest level of warning and is in effect from 18:00 GMT on Saturday until midday on Sunday, with warnings of travel disruption.\nThe counties affected are Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Merthyr Tydfil, Monmouthshire Neath Port Talbot, Newport, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Swansea, Torfaen, Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham.\nThere is also a yellow snow and ice warning for the whole of Wales from midday on Saturday until the end of Sunday.\nThe Met Office warns that:\nPower cuts may occur, which could affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage Travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers Some road closures and longer journey times possible Some delays and cancellations to bus, rail and air travel are likely Rural communities could become cut off Untreated pavements and cycle paths likely to be impassable Northern Lights dazzle in first display of 2025 Cardiff council urged drivers to be careful because of the \"big freeze\" and said it would be using up to 60 tonnes of grit each night to keep the city moving.\nThe roads that are being prioritised are all A roads and priority bus routes, the majority of B roads, some C roads and other non-classified roads\nIt said there were also 400 salt bins across the city for residents to use.\nWhat might happen after snow in Wales? Met Office The Met Office said 3-7 cm of snow was likely for much of the warning area, with 15-30 cm on higher ground Welsh Water said it was distributing free winter lagging kits - insulation and a tap jacket - to prevent pipes freezing and bursting.\nThe company also suggested residents find their stop tap in case pipes burst so the water can be turned off to minimise damage.\nIt also said clearing gutters can prevent excess water entering homes, and fixing dripping taps can decrease the risk of frozen pipes.\nEmpty buildings are at particular risk, it said, and suggested stopping the tap and draining the system so there is no water to freeze.\nPublic Health Wales has issued cold weather advice and guidance ahead of the weekend weather warnings on its social media channels.\nGritting lorries will be out across Wales making the roads safe",
