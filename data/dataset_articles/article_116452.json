  "text": "03 Jan 2025 | 11:40 AM UTC\nKosovo, Serbia: Adverse winter weather forecast across both countries through at least Jan. 5\nAdverse winter weather forecast across Kosovo and Serbia through at least Jan. 5. Hazardous driving conditions likely.\nAdverse winter weather conditions are forecast across Kosovo and Serbia through at least Jan. 5. Heavy snowfall and cold temperatures are expected across the region over the coming days. Hazardous driving conditions are likely due to slippery roads and reduced visibility caused by blowing snow.\nThe Republic Hydrometeorological Service (RHMS) of Serbia has issued the following weather warnings Jan. 3:\nOrange snow and ice warnings (the middle level on a three-tier scale): Southwestern Serbia and Western Serbia regions in Serbia.\nYellow snow and ice warnings: Across Kosovo and Belgrade, Eastern Serbia, Pomoravlje, Southeastern Serbia, Srem, and Sumadija regions in Serbia.\nYellow cold temperature warnings are in place across Kosovo and parts of western and west-central Serbia on Jan. 4, and yellow snow and ice and cold temperature warnings across Kosovo and much of Serbia on Jan. 5. Officials could update and extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days.\nIn addition to the wintry precipitation, strong wind gusts could lead to periods of blowing and drifting snow. Sporadic power outages are possible throughout the affected area.\nThe winter weather will likely cause ground transport disruptions in the region over the coming days. Traffic and commercial trucking delays are probable along regional highways. Authorities will probably close stretches of highways if driving conditions become too dangerous. Gusty winds may threaten to topple high-profile vehicles throughout the affected area. Flight delays and cancellations are likely due to ground stops and deicing operations at regional airports.\nMonitor local media for updated weather information. Verify road conditions before driving in areas where heavy snowfall is forecast. Allow extra time to reach destinations in these areas and carry an emergency kit and warm clothes if driving is necessary, especially on secondary or rural routes that could become impassable. Plan accordingly for delivery delays if routing shipments by truck through the affected area. Confirm flights. Charge battery-powered devices in the case of prolonged electricity outages.",
