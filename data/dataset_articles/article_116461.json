  "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Change is on the way for the weekend as we get set for a risk of storms followed by an Arctic blast next week.\nAfter some early morning clouds today, sunshine will dominate this afternoon. It’s expected to be another pleasant January day with highs in the 60s.\nThis weekend we’ll revert back to the clouds and rain chances move in. Saturday brings with it a 30% chance for spotty showers before we see that rain chance increase to 60% on Sunday. Most of Sunday’s storm threat will be in the evening/nighttime hours.\nNext week will be a cold one as highs each day fall to the 40s with lows in the 20s and 30s. We’ll also be watching for a Gulf low throwing moisture back into the cold air by the end of next week.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.
