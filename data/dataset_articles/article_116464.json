  "text": "Read full article Evening Standard Snow and cold weather warnings for London as rare 'amber' alerts issued for UK as temperatures plummet Michael Howie,Matt Watts and Daniel Keane January 3, 2025 at 2:07 p.m. · 5 min read Link Copied\nHealth officials have issued a warning for London amid plunging temperatures and a forecast for snow at the weekend.\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber cold-health alert (CHA) for all regions of England until midday next Wednesday.\nThe agency said that low temperatures were likely to result in increased use of health care services by vulnerable people and an increase in risk to health for individuals aged 65 and above, as well as those with pre-existing health conditions.\nTemperatures in London plunged below zero overnight, with a ”feels like” temperature of -4C at 7am on Friday and the daytime high expected to be just 4C.\nADVERTISEMENT It came as two new amber weather warnings for snow and ice were issued for parts of England and Wales over the weekend.\nA warning for snow and freezing rain covering most of Wales and central England is in place from 6pm on Saturday to midday on Sunday, the Met Office said on Friday.\nThe second warning for snow, covering most of northern England, has been issued from 9pm on Saturday to midnight on Sunday.\nUp to 30cm of snowfall is expected locally in both warning areas, with 3 to 7cm likely in other areas.\nStranded vehicles on the roads, delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and power cuts are all likely as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nThere is also a \"good chance\" that rural communities could be cut off due to the conditions, with up to 30cm of snowfall expected locally.\nADVERTISEMENT It comes after a series of yellow weather warnings were already issued across the UK by the forecaster between Friday and Monday.\nIssuing the health warning from the cold weather, Dr Agostinho Sousa, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nAn amber alert means that cold weather impacts are likely to be felt across the “whole health service” for an extended period of time.\nThe alert also means there is potential for the “whole population to be at risk” and that “a coordinated response” may be required.\nADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the Met Office on Thursday issued a revised yellow warning for snow from noon on Saturday until midnight on Sunday evening that covers all regions of England other than the South West. The previous warning had run until 9am on Monday.\nAbout 5cm of snow is expected widely across the Midlands, Wales and northern England, with as much as 20-30cm over high ground in Wales and/or the Pennines, the forecaster added.\nThe latest warning maps suggest London could see snow over two periods, the first on Saturday between 5pm and 10pm, and then the second from 10pm on Sunday to 2am on Monday morning.\nIt comes as Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan activated London's Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP) on Thursday to provide emergency accommodation for rough sleepers.\nSchools could potentially be closed and there is a chance of power cuts and road closures as well as delays and cancellations to flights and trains, the Met Office said of snow nationally.\nADVERTISEMENT Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said: “At the moment we’ve issued a very large snow warning for Saturday until Monday but it doesn’t mean that everywhere within that warning could see snow, it’s just a heads-up there could be some impacts.\n“It’s definitely going to start off as snow in many places but it’s a question of how quickly that snow melts and turns back to rain, it’s more likely that the snow won’t last that long in southern England.\n⚠️ Yellow weather warning issued ⚠️\nA risk of snow across parts of Scotland, England and Wales\nSaturday 1200 – Monday 0900\nLatest info 👉 https://t.co/QwDLMfRBfs\nStay #WeatherAware ⚠️ pic.twitter.com/38go97OR7a\n— Met Office (@metoffice) January 1, 2025\n“It’s quite likely the warning will be updated quite frequently between now and the weekend.\n“Certainly if you’ve got travel plans on Sunday and perhaps Monday stay tuned into the forecast.”\nFreezing temperatures are expected to continue in the capital with forecasters predicting lows of 4C during the day and -2C at night over the weekend.\nMeanwhile, fresh weather warnings have been issued by the Met Office across the UK for ice ahead of a blast of snow over the weekend.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland.\nTemperatures had been expected to fall as low as minus 8C in rural Scotland and northern England on Thursday night.\nIt will remain in place until 10am on Friday morning, and could make for difficult travelling conditions, the forecaster warned.\nA snow and ice warning is also in place covering parts of northern Scotland between 4pm on Thursday and 10am on Friday.\nStrong winds could lead to snow drifts in some areas, and freezing rain as temperatures creep up could add to the risk of ice.\nRailways are likely to experience delays or cancellations, with National Rail confirming that various routes across England, Scotland and Wales are impacted.\nPoor weather is currently affecting National Rail's Northern and ScotRail services.\nIn Wales, buses are replacing trains between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\nThe yellow warning indicates there could be icy surfaces in northern and western Scotland, the north-west of England and Northern Ireland, so motorists and pedestrians alike are warned to be wary of icy patches on untreated roads, pavements, or cycle paths.\nA major incident declared in Greater Manchester on Wednesday because of flooding has been stood down, with emergency services and partners now focusing on recovery efforts.\nThere have been no casualties or reports of serious injuries.",
