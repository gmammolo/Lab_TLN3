STV News Beth Franklin Friday, January 3rd, 2025 Share this story\nFacebook\nX / Twitter\nCopy Link\nPosted in Weather Heavy snow is expected to cause travel disruption across Scotland as wintry conditions continue into next week.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning that comes into place at midnight on Sunday and expires at 12pm on Monday.\nThe warning covers central Scotland, Aberdeenshire, the Highlands, the Scottish Borders, and Strathclyde.\nForecasters warned that outbreaks of snow will likely develop on Sunday, with some affected areas seeing “significant” snowfall.\nThe Met Office said the greatest risk is in southern and eastern Scotland, where up to 5cm of snow may accumulate in quite a few places and as much as 10-20cm over higher ground.\nRain or sleet is more likely near some northern and eastern coasts.\nThe Met Office also warned there is a chance of travel disruption and that some rural communities could become cut off.\nAn amber warning for snow has also been issued for parts of England and Wales.\nThe new warning comes after multiple warnings for snow and ice have been in place throughout the week.\nFriday has a warning for ice after temperatures plummeted overnight with some parts of Scotland reaching -6.4C.\nInsight Philip Petrie STV Weather presenter\nLast night, temperatures dropped to lows of -6.4c in Eskdalemuir, -4.7c in Salsburgh, -4.6c at Tyndrum and -4.1c at Tulloch Bridge. We saw a fairly widespread frost and further wintry showers moving into the north, bringing further snowfall accumulations.\nAs of 6am this morning, locations such as Dyce in Aberdeenshire and Loch Glascarnoch in the north-west Highlands were reporting 8cm of snow and 4cm of snow at Altnaharra in Caithness & Sutherland.\nMet Office weather warnings are in force until 10am this morning, but even after that, we will see some impacts throughout the day. We have a snow and ice warning covering the Northern Isles and parts of the northwest Highlands, Angus, Moray, Aberdeenshire and Argyll & Bute. This is because we have further wintry showers moving in, but generally, these will fizzle out throughout the morning and into the afternoon.\nFurther west, an Ice warning covers the Western Isles, stretching down much of the western side of the country. With temperatures dropping below freezing quite widely and struggling to recover throughout the morning, there will definitely be icy roads and pavements.\nCome Saturday, it’s not looking too bad overall. There are plenty of sunny spells around, with some showers—again, these will be most prominent around the north and west of the country. But on the whole, it’s a largely dry day, but it’s still bitterly cold out and about.\nSunday is the day we need to watch. An area of low pressure starts to move in from the southwest, bringing with it a band of rain. As that rain bumps into the colder air, it will bring heavy snow across central and southern Scotland, with the snow continuing to develop overnight into Monday.\nThis is why we already have a yellow weather warning for snow covering the vast majority of central Scotland. It comes into effect at midnight Sunday and runs until midday Monday.\nThe snow could end up being quite disruptive if the current models follow through, but if the low pressure moves a bit further south, then there is a chance the heaviest snowfall will impact more southern parts of the UK. As always, we will be keeping an eye on this over the next 24 hours.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country\nFollow STV News\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country\nPosted in Weather",
