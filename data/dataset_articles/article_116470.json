  "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Northern Europe is facing freezing temperatures and snow, boosting heating demand and putting more pressure on the region’s depleting gas inventories.\nThere are yellow weather alerts over Scotland on Friday, with the risk of blizzard conditions in parts, according to the Met Office, which has amber warnings in place across parts of England and Wales during the weekend. The UK Health Security Agency has issued cold health warnings until Wednesday.\nNortheast France and northwest Germany are also on alert for snow and ice. The snow is likely to get heavier in the north through Friday, while isolated wintry showers are forecast further south, according to the German weather service DWD.\nThere are avalanche alerts in place for the French Alps on Friday, with a considerable danger level in Switzerland above 2,200 meters (7,216 feet), according to the Davos-based WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research.\nIcy conditions could disrupt road transport in France on Saturday, according to La Chaine Meteo.\nThere are snow warnings for parts of Norway, where temperatures in Oslo could fall as low as -15C (5F) over the weekend.\nOn Sunday and Monday, there will be a brief period of much milder weather for northern Europe, before colder conditions return later in the week.\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.",
