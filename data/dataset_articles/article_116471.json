  "text": "The National Weather Service issued a weather alert at 6:56 a.m. EST on Friday for snow showers until 10 a.m. EST for Saginaw, Tuscola, Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, St. Clair, Livingston, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw and Wayne counties.\n\"Snow showers this morning will be capable of a quick coating of snow on untreated roadways that may impact the morning commute. Accumulations of up to a half inch will be possible through the morning hours with visibility reductions to one mile or less under the heavier snow showers. Drivers are urged to use caution and account for variable driving conditions,\" says the weather service.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
