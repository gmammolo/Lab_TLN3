Photo: PA\nRalph Riegel Today at 12:30\nIreland is set for a white Nollaig na mBan as polar weather is set to cause major disruption over the coming days with heavy snowfalls, dense freezing fog, sleet and black ice.\nMet Éireann issued a Status Orange snow and ice warning for Carlow, Kilkenny, Wicklow, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary from 5pm tomorrow to 5pm on Sunday amid concerns that significant volumes of snow will fall in some areas.\nWeather conditions are expected to prove challenging and threaten to significantly impact rail, air and road services.\nRead more Homeowners warned about burst pipes during Arctic blast A second Status Yellow low temperature and ice alert has been issued for tomorrow and Sunday but the national forecaster stressed that further warnings will be issued over the coming days as the precise track of snowfalls becomes clearer.\nTemperatures could sink to as low as minus 10C on Tuesday night.\nThe Status Yellow warning for rain and snow extends from 1pm tomorrow until 5pm on Sunday for Cork and Kerry.\nA Status Yellow alert for snow and ice extends from 5pm tomorrow until 5pm on Sunday for Leinster, Connacht, Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford.\nThe National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM) held a detailed briefing yesterday following consultations with Met Éireann about the Arctic weather front.\nAll local authority Severe Weather Assessment Teams (SWAT) were briefed by the NDFEM on the potential scale of the weather-related challenges facing Ireland next week.\nRead more Mary Kenny: I never cared for walking.

Make big changes at the right time… and it’s not now GAA chiefs on high alert as forecast cold snap threatens to cause fixture disruption Ireland was left under a blanket of white this morning as the cold spell struck with many areas experiencing a severe frost.\nThe polar spell will see snowfalls over the weekend but the coldest weather is likely to strike between next Monday and Wednesday.\nDisruption is expected at some sporting events over the weekend given the impact of the snow and freezing temperatures on ground conditions.\nTemperatures will struggle to rise above freezing in many areas between Monday and Wednesday.\nMet Éireann's Joanna Donnelly warned that there was the potential for significant accumulations of snow in some areas, most likely in the midlands and on higher ground.\n\"This is expected to be a multi-hazard weather event,\" she said. \"Disruption will be due either to the accumulations of snow or, in areas where snow doesn't fall, the sleet and rain that falls.\n\"In those very cold conditions, the rain is going to freeze and that is going to create icy stretches and potentially treacherous conditions for travel,\" she added.\nIrish councils confirmed that stocks of road salt and grit have been replenished for the treatment of all Priority One and Priority Two roads nationwide.\nUisce Éireann and councils are also preparing for any possible disruption caused by the freezing weather to water pipes.\nAll national and major secondary roads have been treated for icy conditions since last Wednesday and council crews will treat the roads daily during the Arctic spell of weather.\nA surfer on Marble Hill Strand beach near Dunfanaghy, Co Donegal yesterday. Photo: PA\nNews in 90 Seconds - January 03 2025\nHowever, there are fears that if the worst of the Siberian weather hits Ireland, it will result in widespread travel disruption early next week.\nBoth gardaí and the Road Safety Authority (RSA) urged people to travel with extreme care.\nTemperatures will sink to minus 5C this weekend but could plummet to minus 10C between Monday and Tuesday making it a potentially chaotic return to work and the classroom for thousands of people after the Christmas holidays.\nAll Irish primary and secondary schools are scheduled to reopen on Monday for 960,000 students.\nA decision on whether to remain closed or to delay reopening times will be a matter for individual school management boards around the country in light of local weather conditions.\nOne government source said that key to any advice offered to schools will be a safety assessment for the operation of the school bus transport fleet between Monday and Wednesday.\nMet Éireann forecaster Gerry Murphy said there would be sleet and snow in many areas on Saturday evening and into Sunday.\n“It will most likely fall as rain down the south coast but it must be said that the amounts of rain expected in the south and south-west are quite high, so it’s likely that we will see rainfall warnings, at least, in the south-west of the country,” Mr Murphy told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.\n“Then, as that rain pushes up through the afternoon/evening, it turns more to sleet, as you go in the hours of darkness then turning more to snow – currently, it looks like – predominantly over the southern half of the country.\n“It’s very difficult to pinpoint but really as we go through tomorrow night into Sunday all areas can expect sleet or snow at some stage.”\nNext Tuesday will see the peak of the Arctic conditions as overnight temperatures potentially sink to a frigid minus 10C.\nNorthern Ireland is also expected to receive snowfalls over the weekend.\nElderly support groups including Age Action have urged people to check on the old, ill and vulnerable in their communities in advance of the Siberian conditions.\nPeople have been asked to check that the vulnerable have access to heating, warm food and drinks as well as proper clothing.\nHomeless support charities have also put in place plans to offer emergency shelter to rough sleepers.\nAgencies dealing with international protection applicants and refugees are also monitoring the Arctic weather forecast to ensure everyone is protected from the worst of the conditions.\nFarming and animal welfare groups have urged all livestock owners to check that animals have sufficient access to fodder and water given the likely impact of snow and ice.\nTwins Ava (left) and Mia Clarke (8) slide down a hill in a park at Portglenone Marina, near Ballymena.
