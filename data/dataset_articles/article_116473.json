  "text": "Another bitterly cold morning in Northeast Wisconsin.\nTemperatures will be below average today with neighborhood highs barely reaching 20 degrees. Northwesterly winds gusting to 25 mpg will bring your wind chill temperatures to 10 degrees today.\nHigh pressure keeps our skies mostly sunny through the weekend.\nThis cold air sticks around into the weekend. Daytime highs are in the upper teens and overnight lows will be in the single digits.\nJanuary is the coldest & snowiest month of the year. Get ready for true winter weather!",
