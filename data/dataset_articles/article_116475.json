The NEMA had urged citizens, especially nomadic herders and drivers, to exercise caution and take preventive measures against potential disasters.\n\\nThe combination of frigid temperatures and unpredictable weather patterns often leads to devastating consequences for both human and animal populations, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\\nIn a tragic example of such risks, over 10 people, mainly nomadic herders, lost their lives in November 2023 due to heavy snow and blizzards in the central province of Tuv and the eastern province of Sukhbaatar.\n\\nLast winter, nearly all 21 provinces of the country endured extreme wintry conditions, accompanied by record snowfall, the largest since 1975. Around 90 per cent of the country's territory was covered in snow up to 100 centimetres thick, leading to the death of approximately 8 million livestock.\n\\nSource: IANS\n\\n\", \"title\": \"40 per cent of Mongolia\\u2019s territory faces high risk of experiencing harsh winter\", \"published\": \"Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:20:46 +0000\", \"author\": \"Gopi\"}",
