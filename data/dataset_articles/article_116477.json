(WRBL) — Good Friday Morning! A few passing clouds to the north this morning as temperatures continue to fall towards freezing and into the upper 20s across the area. Widespread frost will be likely on the ground and especially on elevated surfaces.\nFor today as we close out the first Friday of the new year we will see plenty of sunny skies with winds picking up this afternoon as the frontal system pushes through. Afternoon highs will reach the upper 50s today.\nSaturday starts off cold again with readings likely sub-freezing for everyone and cooler afternoon temperatures in the low 50s and a few areas to the north likely staying in the upper 40s.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Tracking our next system, it arrives Sunday with a few light showers possible throughout the late afternoon and early evening while the bulk of the showers come in overnight and into Monday morning. This system passes through with gradual clearing Monday and ushering in more cold air.\nNext week will be very cold with lows in the 20s and highs in the 40s, which leads to (I know you’ve seen it on social media) the potential for wintry precipitation. As of right now, too early to be specific and everything has to come together in order for it to happen.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
