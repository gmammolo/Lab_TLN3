  "text": "Storm battered Trondheim and Trøndelag : Challenging road conditions and poor mobility\nA storm with strong winds overnight into Thursday left challenging driving conditions and impeded mobility in Trondheim and Trøndelag. In response to the difficult conditions, most bus services in Trøndelag south of Steinkjer have been suspended until further notice, according to the regional public transport provider AtB.\nThe operating status is uncertain, and it remains unknown when services will resume.\nOrange alert issued for heavy snowfall\nMeteorologisk Institutt has issued an orange alert for heavy snowfall in Møre og Romsdal and parts of Trøndelag and Sogn og Fjordane. Some areas may receive between 30 and 50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) of snow.\n\"Both drivers and buses are struggling to get to work and out on the road,\" said AtB director Grethe Opsal in a press release, according to Adresseavisen. Consequently, all bus services have been temporarily suspended.\nSnow clearance at Bakke Bru in Trondheim after an orange alert was issued for heavy snowfall in Møre og Romsdal, parts of Sogn og Fjordane, and southern Trøndelag.
