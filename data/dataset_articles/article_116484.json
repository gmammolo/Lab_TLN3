  "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Downtown Flagstaff is busy with visitors from all over the country visiting and enjoying the sights for the holidays.\nBut there was something missing. Just ask the Rushton family, who traveled from Florida to see the Grand Canyon. They were hoping the city would look a little different when they arrived.\n“This is still really fun but I would really want snow,” said the youngest Rushton family member.\nThere was no snow in sight—not in the streets, the trees, or even on Humphreys Peak, which sits just north of Flagstaff. While the Rushton's still enjoyed their visit, they were slightly disappointed.\n“We would have loved that even if it was just a flurry something magical for us Floridians that would be very nice,” Rushton said.\nIt's not just the visitors who are disappointed. Those living in Flagstaff, like Luciano Svetlitze, were also hoping for a white Christmas and New Year.\n“I wish there was snow,” Svetlitze said.\nHe moved to Flagstaff about six months ago from Gilbert wanting to escape the hot summers. While he admits the snow can create some hassles, Svetlitze doesn't mind having to deal with the slick roads or shoveling the snow from his driveway.\n\"If I'm going to be cold and there's no snow, I'd rather be in Gilbert,\" he said.\nThere is at least one spot where people can enjoy the snow, that's because it's been mostly man-made. Arizona Snow Bowl was packed with skiers and snowboarders on Thursday. Angie Grubb, the marketing manager, said the last snowfall they experienced was on Christmas day.\nSince opening in November, she said crews have been working around the clock to create more snow and open up additional trails.\n“Definitely experiencing some La Nina conditions,\" Grubb said. \"Typically throughout December we usually see a drier year then a lot of our snowfall tends to come in January, February and even March,” Grubb said.\nSnowboarders visiting from out of state including Christian Rogers from Las Vegas, Nevada said he noticed a difference compared to freshly fallen snow, he didn't mind it.\n“I mean it’s not the best it could be but it works,” Rogers said. \"We had a great day, can’t complain for the time of the year.”\n>> Download the 12News app for the latest local breaking news straight to your phone.\nClose Ad",
