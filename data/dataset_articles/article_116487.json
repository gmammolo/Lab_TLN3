  "text": "Commuters bear the brunt as dense fog engulfs city, rural areas\nA thick blanket of fog on Thursday engulfed the city and rural areas, disrupting normal life. The minimum temperature dropped to 6 degrees Celsius as the fog lingered throughout the day, especially in rural areas.\nApart from causing trouble in commuting on roads, foggy weather conditions caused a delay in arrival of at least six trains. Railway officials stated that the train schedule would be further disturbed if foggy conditions prevail for long.\nThe fog was so dense that it made commuting difficult, with vehicles moving at a snail’s pace due to low visibility. Residents, hawkers, vegetable sellers, food deliverymen and milkmen all struggled to carry out their daily activities.\nOn the other hand, the cold weather brought cheer to farmers in the district. They said cold conditions are ideal for the growth of wheat plants. Tajinder Singh, Chief Agriculture Officer (CAO), stated that the district has only reported frost on a few days, and the weather is generally favourable for most crops.\nHowever, farmers may need to take extra care of vegetables and fruit trees in case of frost. The CAO assured that the wheat crop is not a concern, even with frost conditions.\nThe traffic police have advised residents to take precautions to avoid road accidents due to fog. They urged people to ensure that their vehicles’ fog lights, tail lights, indicators, and headlights are in working order. When driving in foggy conditions, it is recommended to use fog and headlights on a low beam for better visibility.\nWeather experts predict that the chilly winds and fog will continue for some more days. Residents are advised to stay safe and take necessary precautions during adverse weather conditions.",
