  "text": "Coinbase’s abrupt decision to withdraw support for the CLARITY Act sent a shock through Washington and crypto markets as well. It triggered the cancellation of a scheduled Senate Banking Committee markup and reignited fears that US crypto market structure reform could once again stall.\nHowever, if the immediate reaction appeared to be political chaos, the response that followed tells a more nuanced story.\nSponsoredCLARITY Act Enters Critical Negotiation Phase After Coinbase Pull-Out\nRather than collapsing, the bill appears to have entered a tense but deliberate pause, one that lawmakers, industry leaders, and even the White House insist is part of the final stretch, not the end of the road.\nSenate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott moved quickly to reframe the delay as constructive.\n“I’ve spoken with leaders across the crypto industry, the financial sector, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, and everyone remains at the table working in good faith,” Scott\n[said].\nAccording to Tim Scott, the goal remains delivering “clear rules of the road that protect consumers, strengthen national security, and ensure the future of finance is built in the US.”\nSenator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key architects, reiterated the message, acknowledging frustration but rejecting the idea that Coinbase’s move had derailed the effort.\nInside the industry, Coinbase’s stance has exposed a clear split, but not a loss of momentum. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse highlighted the Senate’s effort as a significant step forward in providing workable frameworks for the crypto industry.\nAcknowledging that “clarity beats chaos,” the Ripple executive remains optimistic that issues can be resolved during the markup process.\nMeanwhile, a16z’s Chris Dixon struck a similar tone, arguing that while the bill is imperfect, now is the time to move the CLARITY Act forward. This comes as the US seeks to strengthen its position in the global cryptocurrency market.\nKraken executive Arjun Sethi went further, framing the moment as a test of political resolve rather than legislative failure.\nSponsored“It is easy to declare failure. It is easy to walk away when a process gets difficult,” Sethi\n[said], warning that abandoning the bill would “lock in uncertainty and leave American companies operating under ambiguity. At the same time, the rest of the world moves forward.”\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz reinforced that view. Meanwhile, the White House also weighed in, highlighting the stakes.\nWhite House Urgency Meets Senate Frustration as CLARITY Act Debate Shifts\nCrypto and AI czar David Sacks said passage of market structure legislation is “as close as it’s ever been.” With this, he urges the industry to use the pause to resolve differences, establish clear rules of the road, and secure the industry’s future.\nBehind the scenes, however, frustration is a real concern. A Senate source cited by Decrypt’s Sander Lutz reportedly said Banking Committee members were “pretty pissed” about Coinbase’s last-minute announcement.\nSponsored Sponsored“The prevailing sense is it didn’t have to go down this way,” Lutz\n[stated], citing the unnamed source.\nThat frustration likely contributed to leadership’s decision to pull the markup, as confirmed by journalist Eleanor Terrett. BeInCrypto will report once a new date is set.\nYet the broader debate is already shifting. Commentators like Echo X argue the fault line is no longer crypto versus banks. Rather, it is a clash of business models between exchange-dominated platforms and infrastructure-first systems that could outgrow any single company.\nAs Europe, the UK, and Asia continue to roll out unified crypto frameworks, pressure is mounting on US lawmakers to complete what they started.\nFor now, the CLARITY Act is paused, not buried. The coming weeks will determine whether this fragile consensus hardens into law—or fractures under competing incentives. What’s clear is that walking away now would carry its own cost: prolonged uncertainty at home, while regulatory clarity accelerates elsewhere.",
