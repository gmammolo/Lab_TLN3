The challenge invites explorers to discover unique fossil features on the 390-million-year-old Devonian fossil beds, which are among the largest exposed beds in the world.\nAll state park challenges encourage exploration, and most have a physical fitness component, but the fossil challenge also features a mental matching and discovery component. As guests walk around the fossil beds (river level permitting) for fitness, they will try to match these ancient treasures in the limestone with the challenge brochure photos.\nFor hiking enthusiasts, there are many hiking trail challenges to conquer. The longest mileage for hikers is at Charlestown State Park, with the challenge to hike all 16.3 miles of trails at the park. The shortest mileage is the 1.5-mile hike at Indiana Dunes State Park, which contains a 552-foot vertical climb, and where hikers will traverse three of the tallest sand dunes.\nSmall boaters can enjoy paddling challenges at Chain O’Lakes State Park, with its winding nine-lake challenge, and at Summit Lake State Park, with its two-kayak-trails challenge. Both offer healthy challenges on the water with many wildlife viewing opportunities.\nSend items for the Good Morning feature to newsroom@heraldbulletin .com.\nTags Hiking Outdoor Recreation Adventure Travel Walking Fossil Paleontology Trending Video Featured Local Savings The Goshen News Intranet Support local journalism\nLocal news, sports and entertainment when you want it.\nPlease consider subscribing so we can continue to bring you the best local news, sports and entertainment coverage.\nNEWSPAPER ADS Trending Recipes Obituaries Funeral: Jan. 3 PRING, Elmer Feb 8, 1931 - Jan 1, 2025 ADAMS, Martha Feb 25, 1931 - Dec 31, 2024 INGHAM, Patricia Aug 16, 1931 - Dec 30, 2024 BYRNE II, Rodger Jun 5, 1954 - Dec 9, 2024 Barger, Christy Funeral: Dec. 31 More Obituaries PHOTO REPRINTS Graduations, games or events, order prints of your favorites photos from The Herald Bulletin.\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER PHOTOS SCHOOL DELAYS CLICK HERE FOR SCHOOL DELAYS/CLOSINGS Get Breaking News Sign up now to get our FREE breaking news coverage delivered right to your inbox.\nSign-up",
