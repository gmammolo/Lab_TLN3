Burgess will use the funds to purchase books pertaining to multiple cultures to encourage students to read.\nKen de la Bastide | The Herald Bulletin\nANDERSON — The annual Mayor’s Ball in Anderson will provide grants of up to $2,000 to 35 area educators.\nSince 2016, the annual Mayor’s Ball has provided $376,000 in grants to local educators.\n“I really wanted to focus on putting the money to benefit the community,” Anderson Mayor Thomas Broderick Jr. said.\nPrior to Broderick taking office, proceeds from the annual Mayor’s Ball went toward the purchase of decorations for the downtown area.\n“Education seemed like the right place to use those funds,” Broderick said. “We’ve thought about changing how the funds are used, but education makes the most sense.”\nBeginning next week, Broderick will distribute the funds to local educators.\n“It has exceeded our expectations,” he said of the program. “We wanted to spread out the awards to as many schools and educators as possible.”\nRandy Harrison, president of the local teacher’s union, said the funds go to help fulfill teachers’ wish lists.\nHe said in the first year, some of the funds were used for a dentistry program at the vocational school. More recently, the funds have helped to start a photography club.\n“This benefits the educators,” Harrison said. “It’s unbelievable. We didn’t know what to expect.”\nHe said the funds help enhance the educational projects beyond what is budgeted.\n“This would not be possible without the support of the school board,” Harrison said. “Everyone has seen the benefits.”\nFollow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide, or call 765-640-4863.",
