  "text": "Oklahoma skies spawned more tornadoes in 2024 than any previous year, according to preliminary data from the National Weather Service.\nRecords show at least 152 tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma, which surpassed 2012, which had 149. It was an active fall that brought the total so much higher than normal, said State Climatologist Gary McManus with the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.\nThat these are “preliminary” numbers for tornadoes, the 149 are confirmed, McManus said. There are possibly a couple more that officials noted by radar, but eyewitnesses are required for final confirmation, McManus said.\nThe record-breaking 56 tornadoes in April combined with the record-breaking 33 in November, which when combined with the rest came to the 149 total, McManus said.\n“Had a very active April, a record number of tornadoes, so it was a very active spring,” McManus said. “But what kicked us over the previous record was November, where we had over thirty tornadoes. The previous record was 12, set in 1958. We blew that out of the water.”\nTornadoes that hit Nov. 2-3 in Oklahoma tore through homes in Oklahoma City, leveled a neighborhood in Choctaw, and knocked down an elementary school in Newcastle, as well as caused other damage including knocking out the power for 100,000.\nIn all, eight people died in tornadoes in Oklahoma in 2024, according to the weather service.\nHigher than normal temperatures in November combined with a record rainfall as well, McManus said, which created the right conditions for tornadoes that month.\n“We had the wettest November on record across the state of Oklahoma and one of the top-ten warmest,” McManus said. “Being very warm, that sort of thing goes hand-in-hand. We have a really warm November with a lot of severe weather and rainfall, so, a number of tornadoes.”\nEven as the records broke, most of the tornadoes were of the weaker variety, the Enhanced Fujita 0-1 variety, accounting for 34 and 71 events, respectively, according to the weather service. There were no EF-5 tornadoes. However, there were eight EF2, seven EF3, and two EF4 tornadoes.\nWhile the high number of tornadoes might concern many, there is good news, McManus said. The wettest November on record will help stave off drought through what might be a drier than normal January.\n“Well, it certainly helped that we got all that rainfall in November,” he said. “We're in the cool season so it doesn't evaporate as much, the sun's not as high in the sky. It's not as hot of course, and the plants are dormant by October and November, and then into the winter. That keeps us out of drought by and large.”\nAll this information comes as Oklahoma also tied with 2012 as the warmest year on record, with an average temperature of 63.2 degrees, also tying 2012 as the warmest calendar year on record—2.8 degrees above normal, according to the weather service.\nDecember ranked as the fifth-warmest on record with a statewide average of 44.7 degrees, 4.6 degrees above normal, the weather service reported. The Oklahoma Mesonet’s 120 sites recorded December temperatures of at least 70 degrees on 126 occasions, with the highest reading of 76 degrees observed at several locations across multiple days, according to the release.\nOklahoma’s weather records date back to 1895.",
