The Met Office has warned that snow and freezing rain are likely to lead to disruption across the region and possibly up to 7cm of snow in some areas.\nThere is a chance that some rural communities could become cut off due to delays and cancellations to public transport, road closures and some untreated pavements becoming impassable. This weather warning is in place from 6pm on Saturday, January 4 until 12pm on Sunday, January 5.\nThe Met Office states: \"Snow will become persistent and locally heavy as it pushes south to north across the warning area. As well as snow, a period of freezing rain is also likely bringing some hazardous travel conditions, before milder air follows across all areas by Sunday morning.\n\"Whilst there is some uncertainty in details, 3-7 cm of snow is likely for much of the warning area, with locally 15-30 cm for the higher ground of Wales and the southern Pennines. Freezing rain could lead to ice accretion in places, especially parts of Wales, before the milder air leads to a rapid thaw of snow and ice in the south of the warning area through Sunday.\"\nThe amber warning covers a portion of the county to the east, including Lincoln, Sleaford, Gainsborough and Scunthorpe. Meanwhile there is a yellow warning for snow and ice in place across all of Lincolnshire except some parts of the coast between Grimsby and Skegness.\nThis yellow warning is in place from 12pm on Saturday, January 4 until 11.59pm on Sunday, January 5. It warns that \"heavy snow, and some freezing rain in places, may cause some disruption over the weekend.\"\nAccording to the forecast, Lincoln will not go above 3C on Saturday and at times it will feel as cold as -2C. The cold temperatures are expected to continue into next week. Snow is currently forecast between midnight on Sunday and 6am.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
