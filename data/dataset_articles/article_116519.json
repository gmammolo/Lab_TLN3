  "text": "TODAY: It's going to be a cold start to the day with temperatures in the 20s and 30s following the small clipper system that pushed through overnight. We are going to be in store for cold and blustery conditions today. Temperatures will likely only hit the low to mid 30s this afternoon under mostly sunny skies. Winds will stay breezy out of the northwest between 10-20 mph making it feel more like the low 20s.\nTONIGHT: It's going to be a quiet and cold evening. Overnight temperatures will fall into the mid to upper teens.\nTHIS WEEKEND: Saturday will be a replica of today with cold and blustery conditions. Winter weather conditions begin pushing in early Sunday morning. A wintry mix of snow, sleet, ice and even plain rain will be possible across the Tri-State. Current data suggests the greatest concern: significant ice.",
