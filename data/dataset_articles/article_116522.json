  "text": "Amber weather warnings put in place by Met Office for Oakham and Rutland through the weekend\nThe Met Office has updated its weather warnings for snow and ice from Yellow to Amber as likely impacts increase in Rutland.\nBetween 6pm on Saturday 4th January and 12pm on Sunday 5th January, the Met Office has issued an Amber weather warning for snow and ice.\nThis warning means that there is a good chance power cuts may occur, as well as potential impacts on phone signal. There will also be likely impacts on travel as roads become more dangerous to drive on, possibly leaving some drivers and vehicles stranded. It is also likely other transport such as bus, train and air travel will be delayed or cancelled.\nThey also warn that it is likely that some rural communities could become cut off, with areas in Rutland likely to be affected.
