  "text": "Cold Friday, weekend winter storm coming\nCold Friday, weekend winter storm coming\nTHROUGH THE DAY ON SUNDAY. SO HERE’S THE LATEST WINTER STORM WATCH, IN EFFECT FROM NOON SATURDAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT SUNDAY. JUST SOUTH OF THE OMAHA METRO. INCLUDES CASS COUNTY, LANCASTER COUNTY, ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO KANSAS AND MISSOURI. SO THE BIGGEST IMPACTS LIKELY JUST SOUTH OF THE METRO AREA. THAT’S ALSO WHERE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL LIKELY WILL BE. HERE’S THE LATEST SNOW FORECAST 6 TO 12IN POSSIBLE REALLY FROM NEBRASKA CITY SOUTH AND MORE LIKELY CLOSER TO THAT 12 INCH RANGE. MARYVILLE, FALLS CITY AUBURN PAWNEE CITY OUT TOWARD BEATRICE AND THEN DOWN INTO KANSAS AND NORTHWEST MISSOURI TOWARDS SAINT JOE AND THE KANSAS CITY AREA. SO REALLY, THIS STRETCH OF I-29, ONCE YOU GET INTO FAR SOUTHWEST IOWA, INTO MISSOURI, VERY TREACHEROUS TRAVEL, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. BY THE TIME WE GET TO SUNDAY MORNING, LIKELY GOING TO BE A TIGHT GRADIENT TO THE NORTH. SO A DROP OFF QUICKLY AND SNOW TOTALS. WE COULD HAVE 4 TO 6IN PLATTSMOUTH IN MOST OF THE METRO AREA, 2 TO 4IN WHAT I’M THINKING RIGHT NOW WITH MOST OF THAT FALLING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. SO HERE’S THE SETUP STORM PREDICTOR. THIS IS SATURDAY, 5:00 LOW DEVELOPING. SEEING THOSE SNOW BANDS DEVELOP OVERNIGHT WITH THE BIGGER SNOW BANDS SOUTH OF THE METRO. SO WE’RE SEEING MORE OF THAT SIGNIFICANT SNOW LATER SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE MORNING ON SUNDAY. AND WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS IS THE IMPACT OF DRY AIR, BECAUSE THIS COMES INTO THE METRO AREA THAT COULD CUT OFF OUR SNOW FAIRLY QUICKLY SUNDAY MORNING, BUT MORE LIKELY CONTINUING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. AND THAT WINTER STORM WATCH ZONE BEFORE IT MOVES OUT. SO AGAIN, INCREASING IMPACTS LIKELY SATURDAY NIGHT AND THROUGH THE DAY ON SUNDAY. WITH THOSE BIGGEST IMPACTS OFF TO THE SOUTH, THE MAIN SYSTEM THAT’S GOING TO BRING THAT WINTER STORM JUST OFF THE WEST COAST, MOVING ON SHORE TODAY. AND WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING IS IF THE STORM TRACK MOVES AT ALL OR IF IT STAYS CONSISTENT, BECAUSE IF IT MOVES NORTH OR SOUTH HERE OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS, THAT COULD SHIFT THAT FOCUS OF HEAVIER SNOWFALL. SO THAT’S WHAT WE’LL BE WATCHING CLOSELY HERE IN THE COMING DAYS. THIS MORNING WE’VE GOT CLOUD COVER AROUND REALLY ON THE NEBRASKA SIDE OF THE RIVER. MORE CLEARING OFF TO THE EAST. AND THAT’S WHERE WE’RE SEEING MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES. NINE IN DENISON, FIVE IN CARROLL COMPARED TO THE 20S FOR MOST OF EASTERN NEBRASKA, 21 RIGHT NOW IN OMAHA, A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE FEELS LIKE 11 AT EPPLEY SEVEN TEKAMAH LOOK AT THIS. FIVE BELOW ZERO HARLAN EIGHT BELOW ZERO IN CARROLL. SO QUITE COLD EARLY ON, MAYBE A PEAK OF SUNSHINE EARLY TODAY, BUT THE CLOUDS THINNING OUT FOR THE MOST PART. WE’LL SEE. HIGHS LOW TO MID 20S AND CAN’T RULE OUT A FEW FLURRIES AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. MOST HIGHS AROUND THE MID 20S IN OMAHA. COLDER UP TO THE NORTH AND COULD BE AROUND 30 TOWARD LINCOLN, NEBRASKA CITY IN FALL CITY. THAT’S THE CLOUD COVER RIGHT NO. LOOKING OUT FROM 72ND AND CROWN POINT STEPPING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW 21 WITH THE NORTH BREEZE NEAR TEN MILES PER HOUR FEELS LIKE 11 DEGREES. SO HERE’S A CLOSER LOOK AT STORM PREDICTOR THROUGH TODAY. MAINLY CLOUDY AGAIN. CAN’T RULE OUT A STRAY FLURRY, MAYBE BRIEF LIGHT SNOW OUT CLOSER TO CENTRAL NEBRASKA. COLUMBUS AND YORK KEEPING THE CLOUDS AROUND OVERNIGHT SATURDAY STARTING DRY MORE LIKELY SEE A LITTLE LIGHT SNOW OFF TO THE WEST IN THE AFTERNOON, AND MAYBE A FEW FLURRIES, POSSIBLY SOME SPOTTY FREEZING DRIZZLE TO BEGIN BEFORE THE SNOW BANDS REALLY START TO DEVELOP. AS WE HEAD INTO SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN CONTINUING INTO SUNDAY. SO SUNDAY WE’VE GOT THE SEVERE WINTER WEATHER ICON IN WITH THE BIGGEST IMPACTS THERE AND ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE METRO. AND THEN BEHIND IT, A BLAST OF ARCTIC AIR. WE’VE GOT THE IMPACTS NEXT WEEK. THAT’S BECAUSE WE’RE GOING T\nAdvertisement\nCold Friday, weekend winter storm coming\nGetting colder to finish the week Friday before a winter storm impacts the area this weekend.
