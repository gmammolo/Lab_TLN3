Snow showers from Friday afternoon wrap up at night, cold and dry conditions expected over the weekend. The storm begins late Sunday night into Monday, bringing several inches of snow, possibly mixed with sleet and freezing rain. WASHINGTON - The Washington, D.C. region is bracing for winter weather with a significant snow threat from Sunday night into Monday. Will there be a refreeze Friday night? While there may be some slick surfaces from afternoon snow and rain showers, most of the area quickly dries out, aided by gusty winds. There should not be too much of a refreeze issue overnight. READ MORE: DC winter snow storm: Timing, how much to expect by Monday When did the snow start on Friday? The first system brought snow to the area on Friday afternoon and evening. Intermittent rain and snow showers began just after 1 p.m. The snow threat continued until 7 p.m. Most of the day was cloudy with high temperatures near 43 degrees. The snow showers and squalls impacted the Friday afternoon and evening commute. Parts of Maryland to the north and west of D.C. saw a coating of snow on the ground by the time the system moved away. By the early morning, some school districts in the area had announced early dismissal plans.
