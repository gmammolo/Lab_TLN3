  "text": "1 person dead, 1 missing after going through ice in Northern Ontario\nSearch efforts continued Thursday for one of two people seen going through the ice in the Northern Ontario community of Temiskaming Shores over the weekend, police said.\nOntario Provincial Police said someone reported seeing two people go through the ice at Pete’s Dam Park on Sunday afternoon, setting off a search that involved emergency response as well as underwater search and recovery units.\nOne person was found dead on New Year’s Day, police said. OPP said they do not publicly identify victims of accidental deaths but said the person who was found was the younger of the pair.\nAn online fundraiser on behalf of relatives said the two are a father and daughter.\nOPP spokesman Const. Martin Thibault said high currents and large amounts of rain have made the search particularly challenging.\nThe Office of the Chief Coroner and the Ontario Forensic Pathology Service have been called in.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 2, 2025.",
