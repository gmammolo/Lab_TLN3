  "text": "Severe Weather Emergency Provision triggered in Wiltshire\nThe cold snap continues in our part of the world\nWiltshire Council has activated its Severe Weather Emergency Provision for rough sleepers.\nThis comes after the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued an amber Cold-Health Alert for all regions of England from midday on Thursday, January 2.\nFreezing temperatures have been forecast over the next few days and emergency accommodation will be provided for rough sleepers across the county.\nThe Severe Weather Emergency Provision is backed by the government and Wiltshire Council works with the UKHSA and Met Office when considering whether the temperature threshold has been met.\nAccording to the council, the minimum threshold for the protocol has historically been a forecast of zero degrees or below for three consecutive nights, but a “common-sense approach” is applied with all factors taken into consideration.\nWiltshire Council has also requested that rough sleepers be referred to them via Streetlink or by calling 0300 456 0106.\nOutside of office hours, the Emergency Duty Service Team can be contacted on 0300 456 0100.\nThe Rough Sleeper Team and Housing Solutions will be able to make offers of Severe Weather Emergency Provision accommodation, informing individuals of the locations and how best to get there.\nRead more: [UKHSA issue Cold-Health Alert as South West freezes](https://hellorayo.co.uk/greatest-hits/swindon/news/ukhsa-issue-cold-health-alert-as-south-west-freezes/)\nRead more: [Call to help Wiltshire's homeless as cold snap approaches](https://hellorayo.co.uk/greatest-hits/swindon/news/urge-help-wiltshire-homeless-cold-snap/)\n[Hear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.](http://%7B%7BlistenLive%7D%7D)",
