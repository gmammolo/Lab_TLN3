  "text": "By Stefano DiPietro ,\n2 hours ago NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - FIRST ALERT WEATHER DAY - SUNDAY & MONDAY. We continue to track a large and complex storm system headed for the Midstate this weekend and are now beginning to get a clearer picture of what to expect across our area Sunday and into Monday. Precipitation is likely to start to move into the area on Sunday morning and looks like it will start with some sleet and even some light freezing rain across the Midstate. The best areas for this wintry and icy mix will be along and north of I-40 as well as higher elevations in the Cumberland Plateau. The timeline for this mix will be between 4am and noon, but could last longer in some areas in Southern Kentucky. Read full article\nRead in NewsBreak 1",
