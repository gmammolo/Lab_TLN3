It comes as an amber cold health alert has also been launched for the county.\nIt was a cold start in Kent today (January 3) with &apos;feels like&apos; temperatures as low as -7C in Tunbridge Wells. And the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has put the amber cold health alert in place until midnight on January 8.\nThe alert warns the health and social care sector, responders, the voluntary and community sector and government departments when adverse temperatures are expected to impact people&apos;s health and wellbeing. Meanwhile, the yellow weather warning for snow and ice in Kent covers Tunbridge Wells, and other areas such as Maidstone, Ashford and swathes of Canterbury.\nForecasters said \"heavy snow and some freezing rain\" may cause disruption over the coming weekend. Tunbridge Wells is forecast for -2C at around 7am Saturday, the lowest temperature in all of Kent, with the only other area expected to drop that far being Ashford and Tenterden.\nHeavy snow is forecast for Saturday evening by the Met Office but is expected to turn to rain quickly (Image: Met Office) Heavy snow is forecast for Tunbridge Wells tomorrow evening, but it is expected to turn to rain quickly. Tunbridge Wells Borough Council&apos;s severe weather emergency protocol is largely about getting anyone sleeping rough inside.\nThe council uses the StreetLink platform, and has encouraged anyone who is worried about someone sleeping rough in the borough - or need help themselves from local services - to make an alert. StreetLink is used in England and Wales and it issues the alerts to the council and outreach teams.\nThe borough council said: \"This includes anyone who is sleeping outside, preparing to bed down, or sleeping somewhere not designed for habitation, such as a car. Individuals sleeping rough can also submit an alert to get help for themselves.\"\nHow can I make an alert using StreetLink? All you have to do is visit the platform. There are two buttons; one because you have seen someone sleeping rough and want to connect them to support services, and the other is for if you are sleeping rough and want to know what support services locally are there for you.\nClick on this link for more.\nKent forecast for Saturday, January 4 to Tuesday, January 7 For the South East, the weather forecast says tomorrow (January 4) will be a frosty start, with mist and fog patches clearing slowly. The Met Office said: \"Cold day follows, with hazy sunshine. Cloud thickening further ahead of snow spreading north after dusk Maximum temperature 5C.\"\nAnd for Sunday to Tuesday, the snow on Saturday will turn to rain in the early hours of Sunday, with rain, occasionally heavy, during the day but milder temperatures. More rain on Monday, but it will clear early, get colder but you should see some sun. It will remain cold on Tuesday\nChief medical officer at NHS Kent and Medway Kate Langford said: “Prolonged cold weather can be a risk for anyone, but those who are vulnerable, including elderly people, those with breathing difficulties, and children under five, are particularly at risk.\n\"If you have a family member, friend or neighbour who might be vulnerable please do keep an eye out for them. Should you do need NHS help, NHS 111, online or via phone, is there for you and we list all pharmacies and urgent treatment centres at Stop, Think, Choose .\"\nGet Kent&apos;s latest breaking news and top stories on WhatsApp\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
