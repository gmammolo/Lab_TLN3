  "text": "By Jace O'Barto ,\n1 hours ago\nLEXINGTON, Ky. ( FOX 56 ) —With much of the area expected to see extreme ice and low temperatures in the coming days, locals are making sure they aren’t left in the cold.\n“People definitely want to be prepared and winter-ready for sure,” said Chevy Chase Hardware employee Monique Ramangkoune.\nChevy Chase Hardware in Lexington has seen a constant flow of customers getting a jump-start and stocking up on the essentials to stay safe and warm as snow, ice, and arctic air threaten the region.\n“Luckily I’m able to get this done tonight because I know by tomorrow it’s going to get turned into a madhouse, probably,” said Lexington resident Shannon Brewer.\nLatest central Kentucky weather forecast Things like shovels, salt, pet-friendly ice melt, and faucet covers top the list as shoppers get ready to weather the storm.\nBut it’s not so much the snow that they’re worried about.\n“Snow’s okay. Ice? Not so much. Not as easy to deal with,” said one shopper, Craig Irwin.\n“I’ve just got a lot of people that want it to have everything, you know, just for the what-ifs,” Ramangkoune added.\nWhen harsh winter weather threatens, most people believe the best thing to do is stay home if you can.\n“People just need to stay home and be safe. The more you’re out, the more chances there are for accidents. Just kind of be prepared ahead of time,” said Chevy Chase Hardware shopper, Dabney Parker.\nRead more of the latest Lexington & central Kentucky news But businesses are ensuring they’re winter-ready for those who can’t stay home.\nParker is also the interim director of the International Book Project.\n“Being a public entity, I was buying supplies so that we can clear a path to our door for those that are trying to come in,” Parker said.\nTaking safety precautions doesn’t stop at driving, salting the sidewalks, or even ensuring you have what you need to stay warm if you lose power.\nLATEST KENTUCKY NEWS: Kentuckians stock up before they hunker down for severe winter weather Police ask for help identifying man seen in Paducah FOX 56 News celebrates 30th anniversary “Make sure you have your medicines where they’re available to you, especially if there’s anything that needs to be refrigerated. Go ahead and think about that; have your cooler ready,” Irwin said.\nA winter storm watch is in effect Sunday into Monday, so there’s still time to stock up before you hunker down.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
