  "text": "Heavy, blowing snow continues to hit parts of southern Ontario.\nAfter heavy snowfall dumped over 20 cm in the Barrie area on Thursday, snowsqualls continue to hit the area and communities just north of the GTA, according to Environment Canada.\nThe lake effect snow off Lake Huron and Georgian Bay is continuing Friday morning,.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada issued snowsquall warnings for Barrie, Orillia, Bruce Peninsula, Tobermory, Lindsay, Kawathra Lakes, Midland, Owen Sound, Peterborough, Uxbridge and Beaverton.\nAreas in the southwest such as Kitchener, Waterloo, Woodstock and Oxford Country have snowsquall advisories.\nThe heavy snowfall could bring an additional five to 10 cm of accumulation.\nThere will be poor visibility at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nLake effect snow is expected to move south of the area later Friday morning.\nThe lake effect snow will return this weekend over some areas. Visibility will be suddenly reduced to near zero at times in heavy snow and blowing snow.\nRapidly accumulating snow will make travel difficult. Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become difficult to navigate due to accumulating snow.\nEnvironment Canada suggests drivers consider postponing non-essential travel until conditions improve.\nAreas in red have snowsquall warnings, yellow areas are watches and the grey is a weather statement for possible heavy snow.\nLead photo: Dylan Freedom",
