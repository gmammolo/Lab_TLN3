  "text": "St. Louis Public Radio | By Chad Davis Published January 3, 2025 at 5:00 AM CST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email\nBrian Munoz / St. Louis Public Radio A line of cars attempts to stay steady on snow-packed South Grand Avenue in February 2022. MoDOT says it's best for people to stay off the road this weekend to avoid dangerous conditions. Meteorologists say St. Louis-area residents should take precautions this weekend as the National Weather Service and state officials prepare for a winter storm that could cause difficult driving conditions.\nThe National Weather Service predicts winter precipitation between late Saturday and early Monday across the St. Louis area. The region could see a mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow.\nThe area remains in the transition zone, meaning it could see a combination of winter conditions, though the exact details are still unknown, National Weather Service meteorologist Chris Kimble said.\n“This all depends on your location,” Kimble said. “The further north you are, the more likely you are to see snow. The further south you are, the more likely you are to see some freezing rain.”\nKimble said the forecast could change but the storm has the potential to match the February 2022 winter storm in which the region saw between 6 and 10 inches of snow over the course of several days. He said people should stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary.\nState organizations have already started preparing for the potential storm. Missouri Department of Transportation officials have met with NWS, Highway Patrol and State Emergency Management Agency leaders. If people have to leave their homes, they should stick to main roads, MoDOT State Maintenance Director Darin Hamelink said.\n“There may be some instances where some roads have to be closed, we'll just kind of have to see how that plays out,” Hamelink said. “We hope not, but we're kind of, you know, planning for the worst and preparing accordingly.”\nIce storms could lead to power outages, something Hamelink is concerned about. He said people should have a backup plan in case of an outage. If people have to drive, they should take precautions by having emergency kits in their car and make sure they’re at least several hundred feet behind a snow plow.\nThe storm system is expected to end Monday with temperatures below freezing for most of next week.",
