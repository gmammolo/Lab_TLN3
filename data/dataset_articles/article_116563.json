  "text": "Snow covered M9 motorway during Storm Bert – Photo Robert Perry/PA Wire Large parts of the country will face disruption from heavy snow and freezing rain over the weekend after forecasters issued two amber weather warnings.\nStranded vehicles on the roads, delayed or cancelled rail and air travel and power cuts are all likely as the UK grapples with a week-long spell of wintry conditions, the Met Office said.\nThere is also a “good chance” that rural communities could be cut off due to the conditions, with up to 30cm of snowfall expected locally.\nIt comes after initial data indicated Rostherne in Cheshire and Yeovilton in Somerset saw temperatures drop to minus 5C overnight into Friday, just shy of previous estimates which suggested the mercury could dip as low as minus 8C.\nTemperatures of minus 10C could be seen in parts of rural Scotland on Friday night, according to new Met Office forecasts.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January last year was minus 14C, in Dalwhinnie in the Highlands.\nAmber warning\nAn amber warning for snow and freezing rain covering most of Wales and central England, including the Midlands and the north-west cities of Liverpool and Manchester, is in place from 6pm on Saturday to midday on Sunday, the Met Office said.\nThe second warning for snow, covering most of northern England including Leeds, Sheffield and the Lake District, has been issued from 9pm on Saturday to midnight on Sunday.\nBoth of the warning areas can expect to see 3cm to 7cm of snowfall widely, while snow may mix with rain at times in lower-lying areas, the forecaster said.\nThree separate yellow weather warnings for snow and ice are already in place for most areas of the UK, covering different periods of time from Friday to Monday afternoon.\nMet Office chief forecaster Jason Kelly said some “significant accumulations” of snow are possible in parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England, and the additional factor of strengthening winds could lead to drifting of lying snow.\nHe continued: “There is a risk of freezing rain across parts of the Midlands and northern England, but especially Wales, adding to the risk of ice and leading to some treacherous conditions in places.\n“As the super-cooled rain droplets hit the surface they instantly freeze, covering everything in a layer of ice, making it extremely dangerous.”\nAdvice\nNational Highways advised those planning to travel over the weekend to check their vehicles, keep their distance on the roads and pack a “snow kit” of blankets, food, water and a shovel.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nAmber alerts were issued on Thursday and will run until January 8, meaning a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: “The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n“These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.”\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said on Friday it is “a weekend to layer up and put the heating on” due to the cold conditions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: “We are heading into a cold snap this weekend and I know there are lots of concerns, not just amongst charity leaders, but also among NHS and social care leaders as well, about the particular risks and vulnerabilities this weekend as temperatures drop, both in terms of risk of accident and injury, but also risk from the cold itself.\n“This is a weekend to wrap up and keep warm, to take sensible precautions about going out and about.”\nCouncils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: “Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n“St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.”",
