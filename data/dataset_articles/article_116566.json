  "text": "Threat of snow prompts inspection for Sunday meeting at Naas\nSunday's Grade One card at Naas will have to pass an inspection at 7.30am on raceday if it is to go ahead.\nThe fixture is highlighted by the Lawlor's of Naas Novice Hurdle, a top-level contest won by the likes of Envoi Allen and Bob Olinger in recent years, with able support from the Grade Two Racing Post Novice Chase.\nClerk of the course Brendan Sheridan reported the course to be raceable on Friday despite an overnight frost, but with snow a possibility on Saturday night, he felt it prudent to assess conditions on Sunday.\nHe said: \"The ground at Naas is currently soft and fit for racing. There is a grass frost at present but that will clear quite quickly today.\n\"Having spoken with Met Eireann this morning, the forecast for Saturday night into Sunday morning is for rain, sleet or snow. There is an uncertainty at present what will fall so in light of that forecast we will have a 7.30am inspection here at Naas on Sunday morning.\"\nTuesday's meeting at Leicester is already under threat with an inspection also called for Sunday morning.\nOfficials will assess conditions at 7.45am as the track is reported to be waterlogged with rain or snow forecast on Saturday night.\nFriday's card at Musselburgh was called off in controversial circumstances after the track failed to pass a third inspection.\nFollowing checks at 8am and 10.15am, officials took a final look at noon before a long deliberation saw the meeting eventually called off just under 10 minutes ahead of the first race, which was scheduled for 12.27pm.\nSaturday's card at Newcastle is also off with the track frozen and no prospect of sufficient improvement.",
