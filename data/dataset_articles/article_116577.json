  "text": "This weekend, parts of Britain are bracing for over a foot of snow as the Met Office issues two amber warnings while temperatures plummeted to -8C (17F) this morning.\nThe forthcoming days could witness rural areas getting isolated, vehicles stranded on roads, and disruptions in rail and air travel due to blizzards and icy conditions.\nTo prepare for the anticipated snowfall and freezing rain, the Met Office has introduced two new amber weather alerts scheduled to commence tomorrow evening. The warnings caution that snow and ice may accumulate up to 1ft 4in (40cm).\nThe amber alerts cover the Midlands, northern England and Wales – but snow is still forecast for southern England and London which remain under a yellow warning.\nThe first amber warning for snow and ice covering Wales and the Midlands is in place from 6pm tomorrow until midday on Sunday. The second, an amber snow warning for the North of England, was issued from 9pm tomorrow until 11.59pm on Sunday.\nThe amber warnings come on top of the existing yellow snow warning for most of England and the whole of Wales from 12pm tomorrow until 11.59pm on Sunday.\nSeparately, an ice warning has been activated for Scotland, Northern Ireland, North East England and North Wales from 4pm today until 10am tomorrow. And a yellow snow warning is in place for Scotland from 0am on Sunday until 12pm on Monday.\nIt comes after the UK woke up to frosty weather this morning with temperatures falling to -7.5C (18.5F) in Oxfordshire and -6C (21F) in Hampshire and Dorset.\nUK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) amber cold weather health alerts for all of England remain in place until January 8 ahead of a week of low temperatures.\nThe NHS Black Country integrated care board has warned the public to ‘avoid going out early when the frost is thick or late at night when it’s dark’, adding people should keep hands free and wear shoes with a good grip.\nIn Herefordshire, the Wye Valley NHS Trust told people to ‘have sufficient food and medicine and take measures to reduce draughts in your home’.\nHeavy snow falls across Aberdeenshire today as vehicles are driven through Alford\nA swimmer takes a dip at a frosty Beckenham Place Park Lake in South East London today\nA hard frost turns Stonehenge white at dawn in Wiltshire this morning amid sub-zero weather\nPeople brave the cold as they walk through St James’s Park in London this morning\nThe first amber snow and ice warning for Wales and the Midlands states that ‘snow and freezing rain will likely lead to disruption to transport and some other services’.\nMet Office weather warnings in place Yellow – Ice – Today 4pm until Tomorrow 10am – Scotland, Northern Ireland, North East England and North Wales Yellow – Snow – Tomorrow 12pm until Sunday 11.59pm – England and Wales Amber – Snow and ice – Tomorrow 6pm until Sunday 12pm – Wales and the Midlands Amber – Snow – Tomorrow 9pm until Sunday 11.59pm – Northern England Yellow – Snow – Sunday 0am until Monday 12pm – Scotland It adds that there is a ‘good chance that power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage’.\nThe warning also says that ‘travel delays on roads are likely, stranding some vehicles and passengers’ and ‘some road closures and longer journey times possible’.\nIn addition, the Met Office warns ‘some delays and cancellations to bus, rail and air travel are likely’; ‘there is a good chance that some rural communities could become cut off’; and ‘untreated pavements and cycle paths likely to be impassable’.\nForecasters expect the snow to become persistent and heavy as it pushes south to north across the warning area, with freezing rain also expected to bring ‘hazardous travel conditions’, before milder air follows by Sunday morning.\nBetween 3cm (1.2in) and 7cm (2.8in) of snow is likely for much of the warning area, with 15cm (6in) to 30cm (1ft) for the higher ground of Wales and the southern Pennines.\nFreezing rain is also expected to lead to ice in parts of Wales, before the milder air leads to a rapid thaw in the south of the warning area on Sunday.\nSimilar details are contained in the second amber warning for northern England.\nThis alert also states: ‘Snow will be persistent and heavy at times, and will likely drift in brisk easterly winds, especially over higher ground.’\nTODAY: An ice warning is in place for northern areas from 4pm today until 10am tomorrow\nTOMORROW: The first amber warning for snow and ice covering Wales and the Midlands is in place from 6pm tomorrow until midday on Sunday. The second, an amber snow warning for the North of England, was issued from 9pm tomorrow until 11.59pm on Sunday. The amber alerts come on top of the existing yellow snow warning from 12pm tomorrow until 11.59pm on Sunday\nSUNDAY: The warnings are then joined on Sunday by a yellow snow alert for most of Scotland\nMONDAY: The final alert, a yellow snow warning for Scotland, runs until 12pm on Monday\nMuch of this warning area can also expect 3cm (1.2in) to 7cm (2.8in) of snow, while areas above about 150m (500ft) will likely see 15cm (6in) to 30cm (1ft), with 40cm (1ft 4in) for ground above 300m (1,000ft).\nThe alert adds: ‘For some lower-lying areas, such as the Vale of York, snow may mix with rain at times making estimations of snow depths here more difficult. Regardless, travel will likely be difficult, with power line icing an additional impact.’\nNational Rail Enquiries said the line between Inverness and Dingwall in northern Scotland would be closed until at least 11am on Saturday because of ‘multiple landslips and areas flooded’, meaning no ScotRail services between Inverness and Wick/Thurso and between Inverness and Kyle of Lochalsh.\nMet Office Chief Forecaster Jason Kelly said: ‘This weekend will bring a range of weather hazards to the UK, notable snow accumulations, freezing rain, ice and heavy rain as well as some gusty conditions.\nA frosty scene at South Yeo Farm East in Devon today as the UK wakes up to very cold weather\nA person braves the cold walking through Green Park on a very chilly day in London today\nDonkeys at a frosty paddock in Dunsden, Oxfordshire, this morning after a bitterly cold night\nSt Thomas Becket church is surrounded by frosty fields on Romney Marsh in Kent today\n‘We have issued a number of severe weather warnings, including Amber warnings for snow and ice in parts of England and Wales.\n‘Some significant accumulations of snow are possible across parts of Wales, the Midlands and northern England in particular, where 5cm or more could accumulate fairly widely, with as much as 20 to 30cm over high ground of mid and north Wales and potentially 30 to 40cm over parts of the Pennines. This, accompanied by strengthening winds, may lead to drifting of lying snow.’\nHe added that as the milder air moves northwards, snow may turn to a spell of freezing rain for a time.\nMr Kelly said: ‘There is a risk of freezing rain across parts of the Midlands and northern England, but especially Wales, adding to the risk of ice and leading to some treacherous conditions in places.\n‘As the supercooled rain droplets hit the surface they instantly freeze, covering everything in a layer of ice, making it extremely dangerous.’\nThe amber alerts from the UKHSA mean a rise in deaths is likely, the agency said.\nPeople brave the cold as they walk through St James’s Park in London this morning\nFields during a frosty morning at Southam in Warwickshire this morning\nFrost covers houses and the ground at Martham in Norfolk today amid the sub-zero weather\nA freezing start to today as a cyclist makes their way through Blackheath in South East London\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: ‘The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, including those aged 65 and over and those with pre-existing health conditions, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable.\n‘These people could be more at risk of heart attacks, stroke and chest infections as a result of cold temperatures.’\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting said today that it was ‘a weekend to layer up and put the heating on’ due to the cold conditions.\nHe told BBC Breakfast: ‘We are heading into a cold snap this weekend and I know there are lots of concerns, not just amongst charity leaders, but also among NHS and social care leaders as well, about the particular risks and vulnerabilities this weekend as temperatures drop, both in terms of risk of accident and injury, but also risk from the cold itself.\n‘This is a weekend to wrap up and keep warm, to take sensible precautions about going out and about.’\nCouncils across London and southern England have activated emergency measures including additional accommodation to help rough sleepers stay safe during the cold snap.\nJames Lally, services director of homelessness charity St Mungo’s, said: ‘Access to a safe and warm place to live is vital for those experiencing homelessness all year round – and during freezing cold weather, emergency accommodation saves lives.\n‘St Mungo’s frontline teams are prepared to respond to this critical situation, and continue to work tirelessly around the clock to make sure that as many people as possible can be brought out of the cold and into safety.’\nDan Stroud, meteorologist at the Met Office, said conditions should become warmer by the end of the weekend before cold weather strikes again early next week.\nHe said: ‘The second half of the weekend should be in the high singles or low doubles (for temperature figures).\n‘But temperatures will dive again next week, particularly on Monday and Tuesday.\n‘They should start to improve towards the latter end of the week. But there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge until then.’\nBookmaker Ladbrokes has cut odds that this month will be the coldest January on record, down from 3/1 to 4/5.\nThe coldest temperature recorded in January 2024 was -14C (7F) at Dalwhinnie in the Scottish Highlands.\nAfter a brief respite of milder air for some areas on Sunday, colder conditions are set to develop widely across the UK into next week.\nMet Office deputy chief forecaster Dan Holley said: ‘The system bringing this weekend’s snow will move away to the east by Monday, allowing a cold a northerly flow to become established again for much of next week.\n‘This will bring further snow showers to northern Scotland in particular, but possibly to some other areas, especially near western coasts, with a fair amount of dry and bright weather elsewhere.\n‘Temperatures will remain below average, with widespread frost and the risk of ice at times.\n‘Some areas, especially in the north, may struggle to get above freezing for several days. It is possible further weather warnings will be issued for the start of next week, so it’s advisable to stay up to date with the forecast.’\nNational Highways Severe Weather Resilience Manager, Darren Clark, said: ‘If you are travelling this weekend, keep your distance and reduce your speed.\n‘Gritters will be out treating our roads around the clock when ice or snow is forecast, but it is still important to drive to the conditions.\n‘Even in conditions that seem normal and where the snow is not settling you could always experience slippery conditions.\n‘Drivers should plan their journeys, check their vehicles, monitor weather reports and pack a snow kit of blankets, food, water and a shovel.’",
