  "text": "The system will move through the Midwest over the weekend before arriving in much of the Northeast on Monday, Jan. 6, according to the National Weather Service.\nAreas in the lightest shades of blue in the first image above should see between 1 to 6 inches of snowfall, while regions in the darkest blue shade may receive half a foot to a foot of snow.\n“Over a dozen states are forecast to be impacted by one or more aspects of this storm,” said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.\nMajor hubs in the storm’s path for potential snow and ice include New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. (Click on the second image above.)\nBut there's still uncertainty surrounding the ultimate track of the storm.\nCold air that arrived on Thursday, Jan. 2, will linger into next week.\nMost of the Northeast will see a mix of clouds and sun on Friday, Jan. 3, but a quick-moving system will bring rain showers or snow squalls to parts of Washington, D.C., as well as Virginia and Maryland in the afternoon into the night, potentially impacting the evening commute.\nCheck back with Daily Voice for updates.\n[Click here]\nto follow Daily Voice\nBriarcliff\nand receive free news updates.",
