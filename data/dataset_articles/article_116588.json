  "text": "Photo: Getty Images\nCentral New York is bracing for another round of heavy lake effect snowfall today (January 3). The National Weather Service has issued a Lake Effect Snow Warning for several counties, including Madison, Onondaga, Oswego, and Oneida. Forecasters predict these areas could receive between one and three feet of snow through the weekend.\nThe snow is expected to be accompanied by strong wind gusts, reaching up to 45 mph, which could lead to power outages and hazardous travel conditions. The heaviest snowfall is anticipated in Oswego and northern Cayuga counties, with the Tug Hill Plateau likely to see the highest accumulation. Residents are advised to prepare for rapidly changing road conditions and reduced visibility, especially on secondary roads.\nThe Lake Effect Snow Warning will remain in effect until Sunday (January 5) evening. For those needing updates, emergency alerts are available at alert.ny.gov . Travelers are urged to exercise caution and stay informed about the latest weather developments.",
