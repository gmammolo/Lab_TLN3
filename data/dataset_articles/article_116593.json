  "text": "A multiday lake-effect snowstorm is expected to bring significant snowfall across New York. Areas downwind of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in Upstate New York and northwestern Pennsylvania could receive several feet of snow due to the event, lasting through Sunday, January 5.\nSyracuse and Utica, along with northern and eastern portions of New York, has already experienced snowfall starting Thursday, January 2.\nArctic air moving in from Canada could bring 7.5 to 90 cm (3 inches to 3 feet) of snow to parts of central and western New York through the weekend. Communities on the Tug Hill Plateau, east of Lake Ontario, are expected to see 60 – 90 cm (2 – 3 feet) of snow by Sunday.\nIce and snow – TAKE IT SLOW! Snow is impacting travel conditions this afternoon, including here in the Utica and Verona areas. If you plan to travel this afternoon, SLOW DOWN and expect plows to be out clearing and treating the road. #DontCrowdThePlow pic.twitter.com/wkYSrfphaM\n— New York State Thruway Authority (@NYSThruway) January 2, 2025 Blizzard conditions continue due to heavy lake snowfall in Utica NY #nywx\nTraffic is very slow pic.twitter.com/Dl5NL9b2eB\n— James🌦️🌧️⛈️ (@James7576884387) January 2, 2025 The intense lake effect snow band north of the NYS Thruway will be remaining focused across Oneida County tonight.

Intensity will vary off Lake Erie before increasing again on Friday,” said the National Weather Service (NWS) Buffalo office.\nRounds of lake effect snow should continue through the weekend.

Warnings have also been issued for Oneida, Madison, and Onondaga counties through Sunday.\nSignificant snowfall totals are expected from Thursday through Friday, with areas such as Syracuse, Oswego, and Boonville likely receiving 30 – 48 cm (12 – 19 inches) of snow. Localized totals may exceed 90 cm (36 inches) in areas such as Florence.\nBands of snow could lead to reduced visibility and slippery conditions, creating dangerous travel conditions in many areas.\nA band of lake effect snow lifting north across the Capital District is resulting in briefly heavy snow, reduced visibilities, and possibly slippery travel conditions on untreated roads.
