  "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Central Floridians, brace yourselves as a big winter blast is coming and staying through for quite a stretch!\nA one, two punch is expected to move into the area over the next 10 days, ushering in some of the coldest weather we have seen in years.\nJetstream Outlook This wave of cold air is driven by the jet stream, which is like a “fast river of air” in the upper levels of the atmosphere atmosphere, influencing the path and intensity of these fronts. Each dip seen in the upper atmosphere allows another influx of cold air to settle over the region.\nFRIDAY-WEEKEND:\nThe first punch of cold air is forecast to track through with little fanfare late Friday. Ahead of the front, highs will remain below average in the mid 60s with lows in the 40s. But by Saturday, another cool and sunny day sets up in the low 60s with the coldest point of the weekend on Sunday morning.\nWake up temperatures are expected to dip back into the upper 30s to low 40s with patchy frost possible. Temperatures will moderate a bit back to near 70 by Sunday afternoon.\nMorning Low Trend NEXT WEEK\nThe most significant cold front we’ve seen in years for Central Florida arrives Monday. Before the front clears it will be a warm day with highs running above average in the mid to upper 70s. As the front moves overhead, a few scattered showers can’t be ruled out with coverage minimal at only 20-30%.\nIn its wake, temperatures are expected to plunge about 20 degrees starting Tuesday. Forecast shows highs remaining in the 50s from Tuesday through next weekend with lows dropping into the 30s almost areawide, with some locations entering into the 20s.\nHigh Temp Trend The last time we’ve seen a stretch of daytime temperatures staying in the 50s was a 6-day stretch in January 2018.\nFor the latest weather updates and alerts, visit ClickOrlando.com .
