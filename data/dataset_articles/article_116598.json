  "text": "Firefighters on alert as blaze burns at Joanna, SA ahead of hot weather\nIn short:\nA fire at Joanna, near Naracoorte in South Australia, started on Wednesday afternoon.\nIt is burning through dense scrub and has been difficult for firefighters to access.\nWhat's next?\nThe Country Fire Service says hot weather this weekend could cause the fire to grow and spread through a dry area.\nSouth Australia's Country Fire Service says a blaze burning through dense scrub in the state's south-east could turn serious, ahead of forecast hot weather this weekend.\nThe fire at Joanna, around 15 kilometres south of Naracoorte, has so far burned through 44 hectares of scrub since it started on Wednesday afternoon.\nA watch and act message urging residents to leave was activated on Wednesday afternoon but was later downgraded to an advice message which is still active.\nThe fire continued to burn throughout Thursday, with the dense scrub limiting access for CFS volunteers and trucks.\nIt is also burning close to forestry pine plantations.\nTemperatures at Naracoorte are expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius today, before climbing to 37C on Saturday and 35C on Sunday, with winds ranging from 15 to 35 kph across the weekend.\nA cool change is set to arrive ahead of Monday, when temperatures are expected to fall to 24C with the chance of rain.\nCFS regional duty commander Scott Murray said nearby residents, particularly to the south and east of the fire, needed to be prepared.\n\"If we do get ignitions or something breaks away over the weekend, we may find that it's difficult for our crews to stop,\" he said.\n\"People need to make sure that they're prepared to use their bushfire survival plan, stay informed and leave early.\"\nMuch of South Australia received well below its average rainfall in 2024, including Naracoorte where, 349 millimetres of rain fell last year, compared to an annual average of 577mm.\n\"The heavy vegetation, the pine trees, the native vegetation blocks, the grassland, there's no moisture in them,\" Mr Murray said.\n\"If we do have a fire start, the potential for a fire to move quite quickly is quite high.\"\nKennels, livestock threatened\nThe fire is burning close to agriculture research facility Struan House.\nPrimary Industries and Regions SA's Peter Appleford said the fire had burned a \"couple kilometres\" of fencing and onto the property.\nHe said some livestock had to be moved out of harm's way.\n\"It's probably going to burn for a little while yet,\" Mr Appleford said.\n\"We'll keep a close eye on it and if it looks like it's going to threaten any of the facilities, we'll be in regular contact with the CFS and local emergency services.\"\nAndy Grant owns a boarding kennel at Struan and said he noticed the fire starting in a nearby property on Wednesday afternoon.\n\"It was gaining momentum,\" he said.\n\"I raced off and got the firefighting water tank and pump, and as I arrived the CFS arrived at the same time.\"\nMr Grant said his wife Jo went to the kennels, but the wind was blowing the fire away from their property.\n\"We've got sprinklers on the roofs and a caravan set up to take all the dogs away if we needed,\" he said.",
