  "text": "[WORLD](https://caliber.az/en/category/world)\nMassive traffic pileup in Kazakhstan involving around 40 vehicles due to snowstorm VIDEO\nA major traffic accident involving approximately 40 vehicles occurred on a highway in Kazakhstan’s Akmola region, caused by a snowstorm and poor visibility.\nThe incident took place on January 3 on a section of the road between the villages of Kogam and Karatal in the Birzhan Sal district, [Caliber.Az](https://caliber.az/en) reports [via](https://tass.ru/) Russian media.\nAccording to the regional police department’s press service, the collision resulted from rapidly worsening weather conditions, including heavy snow and limited visibility. Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene to manage the situation and ensure the safety of those involved.\nNo reports of casualties or injuries have been confirmed so far. The local authorities have launched an operation to evacuate the damaged vehicles and restore normal traffic flow. Measures are also being implemented to ensure road safety in the area.\nAuthorities had previously issued warnings to the public about the potential for deteriorating weather in the region. Drivers were advised to avoid travel, particularly on rural roads, due to the hazardous conditions caused by the snowstorm.\nBy Vugar Khalilov",
