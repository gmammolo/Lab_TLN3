  "text": "Shafaqna India: Heavy fog disrupted air and rail travel in New Delhi on Friday morning, with more than 100 flights delayed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport due to poor visibility. While landings and takeoffs continued, flights not equipped with CAT III technology faced delays.\nDelhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) advised passengers to stay updated on flight schedules, warning of potential cancellations if visibility worsens. DIAL handles around 1,300 flight movements daily, many of which rely on CAT III systems to operate in low-visibility conditions.\nRail travel also suffered, with at least 24 trains departing from Delhi running behind schedule. Notable delays included the Ayodhya Express (4 hours), Gorakhdham Express (over 2 hours), and both the Bihar Kranti and Shram Shakti Express (over 3 hours).\nTravelers were urged to verify schedules and expect disruptions as dense fog blanketed the region.",
