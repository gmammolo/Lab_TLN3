But this storm will break that mold and bring treacherous conditions to millions from the Plains to the East Coast, including in areas less prone to winter weather.\nAnd where it’s too warm for snow and ice, the storm could conjure up severe thunderstorms, including in some of the same areas still recovering from December’s deadly storms .\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Major impacts, including “considerable disruptions to daily life … dangerous or impossible driving conditions and widespread closures,” are expected from this storm through Sunday in parts of the Central US, according to the Winter Storm Severity Index.\nIt all starts on Saturday afternoon when the storm develops in the Plains, fueled by a deep surge of moist air moving north out of the Gulf of Mexico. It will start to spread snow, rain and an icy mix over the Plains late in the day as it strengthens and expands.\nFrom there it will track east and spread a wintry mess into the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Midwest by Sunday morning. The storm will expand into the Ohio Valley and Southeast Sunday and to the East Coast Sunday night and Monday.\nThe regions at greatest risk are clear, but exactly who gets snow, ice or mainly rain — and how much — is still incredibly difficult to determine. Small shifts in the storm’s track could change the outcomes entirely. Some areas could start as snow but change over to an icy mix as warmer air enters the area, while other spots start as rain or an icy mix and gradually change over to snow.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement This storm will be capable of unleashing more than a foot of snow and enough ice to knock out power just as the coldest temperatures of the season arrive in its wake.\nSnow will bury some areas The storm will lay down several inches of snow from late Saturday through Monday in a stripe that stretches from parts of Kansas and Nebraska to the East Coast.\nThe highest snow totals will rack up in the coldest areas, likely in parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia. Totals will be lower in areas where warmer air generates sleet and ice instead of snow.\nSt. Louis has only seen four days where more than a foot of snow fell in a day — a feat that could happen Sunday. Snow totals could range from an inch to more than a foot in parts of Missouri, depending on the storm’s exact track. This could also be the case for the other states with the greatest chances of snow.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Ice-T calls cop a ‘f–king a–hole’ during tense exchange caught on bodycam video: ‘This muthaf–ka’ NY Post Major winter storm to bring blizzard conditions this weekend; See forecast, snowfall maps USA TODAY 'There's nothing else we can do': Stranded Lake Michigan boat could be stuck for months Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Soldier Left Note Explaining Why He Turned a Cybertruck Into a Suicide Bomb The Daily Beast Unlike during other storms this winter, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Upstate New York could receive little-to-no snow because of the storm’s more southerly track. Some lake-effect snow is possible in Michigan and New York as the wind direction shifts both before and after the storm.\nTreacherous ice to come The greatest risk of dangerous ice will set up just south of the snowiest areas. Significant icing is possible from Kansas and Missouri through the central Appalachians and potentially parts of Maryland and Delaware.\nTravel could be “nearly impossible” in the areas of heaviest icing, multiple National Weather Service offices warned.\nIce amounts of 0.25 inches or more are possible, especially in parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and almost all of Kentucky.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Any amount of ice is dangerous; just a thin layer – a light glaze to just over 0.10 inches – can turn paved surfaces into skating rinks, causing people to slip and vehicles to slide out of control.\nA car slides around a corner amid snow in Des Moines, Iowa, on Thursday. Scenes like this will be playing out across the eastern two-thirds of the US once a major winter storm hits over the weekend. - Cody Scanlan/The Register/USA Today Network/Imagn Images The thicker the ice, the worse its impact. Heavy ice – 0.25 inches or more – weighs down trees and power lines and can snap branches or pull down electrical wires. Large amounts of ice could also completely immobilize travel by making roads impassable.\nAn ice storm that slammed the Central US in January of last year knocked out power to thousands and sent first responders spinning out of control as they tried to reach people in distress.\nPower outages could be widespread and long-lasting if significant icing occurs and power restoration crews can’t navigate treacherous roads. That situation could be dangerous or potentially deadly for those without access to heat in the extreme cold to come.\nDamaging thunderstorms and soaking rain The southern, warmer side of the storm will spread rain and some embedded thunderstorms over much of the South. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, especially on Sunday afternoon.\nAdvertisement Advertisement A level 3 of 5 threat of severe thunderstorms is in place Sunday for parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\nDamaging wind gusts and hail are the most likely threats from any severe thunderstorm but tornadoes are also possible. A tornado outbreak , including multiple rated EF3s, rocked parts of the South in late December.\nDamage in the aftermath of severe thunderstorms in Porter Heights, Texas, on December 28, 2024. - The Woodlands Fire Department Rain and storms could also cause flooding, especially where the heaviest rain falls in the Southeast.\nThe massive storm will finally exit the East Coast late Monday and fully diminish in impact overnight.\nBut Tuesday presents a new problem: Arctic cold. Temperatures will plunge as much as 30 degrees below normal for the eastern two-thirds of the US and the frigid air will last for some into at least the middle of January, locking in whatever snow and ice fall from the storm.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 26,064 people played the daily Crossword recently.
