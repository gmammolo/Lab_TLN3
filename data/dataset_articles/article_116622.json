Updated: 11:07 AM EST Jan 3, 2025 Winter storm watch: Ice, snow, sleet all possible Sunday-Monday Share Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 11:07 AM EST Jan 3, 2025 HEADED TOWARDS FREEZING BY 6:00. SO THIS LITTLE SYSTEM THAT’S WORKING ITS WAY ON THROUGH NOW PAVES THE WAY FOR THE COLD AIR TO BE IN PLACE. AS WE TURN OUR EYES TO THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE. STILL A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES OFFSHORE THE WEST COAST OF THE U.S. BUT AS IT MOVES ONSHORE, COUPLE OF THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. WE’RE GOING TO START GETTING BETTER WEATHER DATA FOR THE COMPUTER MODELS THAT WILL SHOW THE TRACK OF THIS STORM. SO THE SOLUTION OF WHAT TO EXPECT BECOMES A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC OVER THE NEXT ABOUT 24 HOURS. BUT ONE THING I DO THINK IS FOR SURE, SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY, WE CAN ANTICIPATE WINTER STORM CONDITIONS ACROSS A GOOD CHUNK OF THE WLKY REGION WITH ANYTHING FROM SNOW, SLEET, ICE AND ESPECIALLY IN OUR FAR SOUTHERN COMMUNITIES. AT TIMES, ALL RAIN OF EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE ACCUMULATING SNOW AND ICE. TOUGH TRAVEL AND EVEN POWER OUTAGES. YES, POWER OUTAGES WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR THE ICING ACROSS THE REGION NOW, THE HIGHER SNOW AND SLEET ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE TO THE NORTH. BUT IN TERMS OF THIS ICING, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT ICING AND THE GREATEST CONCERN OF THIS WHOLE STORM IS GOING TO BE RIGHT ALONG THE OHIO RIVER AND THE I-64 CORRIDOR. AND WHILE THAT STORM IS STILL WELL OFF TO THE WEST AND COULD CHANGE A LITTLE BIT, ANY JOG TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH SHOULD HAVE EVERYONE PREPARING FOR THIS WINTER STORM. AS WE GET INTO SUNDAY AND MONDAY, I WANT TO LOOK FIRST AT THE ICE AND AGAIN WHERE YOU SEE THESE DEEPER SHADES OF PINK AND RED, WHICH IS RIGHT ALONG THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY, AND ALSO A GOOD CHUNK OF THE WLKY REGION. THESE ARE LOCATIONS WHERE WE COULD SEE PERHAPS A HALF AN INCH OF ICE OR MORE, COATING TREES AND POWER LINES, AND PERHAPS BRINGING SOME OF THOSE DOWN, LEADING TO POWER OUTAGES. IN TERMS OF THE SNOW, THE HEAVIEST BAND LIKELY NORTH OF OUR REGION AND CLOSER TO THE I-70 CORRIDOR TOWARDS CINCY, INDY, MAYBE COLUMBUS, OHIO, AND BACK THROUGH CENTRAL ILLINOIS, WHERE SOME COULD PICK UP A FOOT OF SNOW WILL BE ON THE LIGHTER SIDE, BUT STILL A COUPLE INCHES OF SNOW ACCUMULATION. STILL EXPECTED, AND THAT WILL LIKELY BE AT THE LEADING AND BACK EDGE OF THIS SYSTEM. SO WE’RE KIND OF GOING TO SNEAK IN BETWEEN SOME SNOW ICE, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW ON TOP. IT’S GOING TO BE A MESS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY ACROSS OUR AREA, SO YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IT. THAT’S WHY WE HAVE THE SEVERE ALERT DAY. I THINK THE WORST OF IT. SUNDAY WE GET ON THE BACK EDGE OF IT. MONDAY MAY STILL HAVE SOME SNOW ACCUMULATIONS HERE AND THEN THE COLDER AIR BUILDS IN TUESDAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. ANY SNOW AND ICE ISN’T GOING ANYWHERE. WITH THOSE HIGHS AND LOWS WELL BELOW FREEZING, IN FACT, WILL BE IN THE SINGLE NUMBERS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY MORNING. WE WATCH IT ALL CLOSELY FOR YOU AND GIVE YOU T Advertisement Winter storm watch: Ice, snow, sleet all possible Sunday-Monday Share Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 11:07 AM EST Jan 3, 2025 ALERT: A winter storm watch in effect from early Sunday to Monday morning. A winter storm is imminent this weekend for the WLKY region, with a wide range of potentially serious impacts.CLOSURES | INTERACTIVE RADAR| ACTIVE WEATHER ALERTS Sunday morning through Monday, we can anticipate winter storm conditions across a good chunk of the Louisville area and surrounding counties.We'll see a mix of ice, sleet and snow -- with ice currently being the main concern around the Metro.The higher snow and sleet accumulation are expected to be to the north, like in southern Indiana.But in terms of icing, the most significant part and the greatest concern of this whole storm is going to be right along the Ohio River in the I-64 corridor. Some areas could see half an inch of ice or more. The ice has the potential to cause significant power outages and road issues. Check power outages: Duke | LG&ERoad conditions: Kentucky & IndianaAgain, there could also be some significant snow accumulations. It's too early to talk totals just yet.As far as timing, conditions will start deteriorating around Louisville mid-late morning, after 7 a.m., and even likely after 8 a.m.We'll get more information once the storm hits the U.S. The bottom line: Sunday into Monday will be a mess and everyone should be prepared.And what falls will stick around, as temperatures will stay well below freezing in the days following. The storm is still well off to the west and could change a little bit, so keep your eyes on the WLKY forecast for the latest details.
