  "text": "By Amanda Holly ,\n5 hours ago\nTAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — It is a cold start this morning with temperatures in the 30s and 40s across the Tampa Bay area. It stays cool all day with high temperatures in the upper 60s under mostly sunny skies.\nTemperatures will drop quickly again this evening under clear skies and light winds. Lows will be back in the 30s and 40s Saturday morning.\nSaturday will be the coldest day of the weekend with highs only in the low to mid-60s despite full sunshine and it will be chilly again Saturday night.\nHowever, a brief warming trend gets underway Sunday afternoon with highs back in the low 70s. It stays dry through Sunday with the next chance for rain coming in on Monday as another cold front moves in.\nIt’s mild Monday afternoon ahead of the cold front but much colder behind it. Temperatures starting next Tuesday will only top out in the 50s during the afternoon.\nHighs will stay in the 50s most of if not all of, next week and into the weekend. Low temperatures will be in the 30s, even in Tampa, for a few nights next week as well.\nClose Thanks for signing up!\nWatch for us in your inbox.\nSubscribe Now\nDaily Weather Forecast Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
