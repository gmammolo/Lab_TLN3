  "text": "SALINA, Kan. (KWCH) - Winter will roar into Kansas this weekend, bringing freezing rain and snow that will make driving treacherous across much of the state. The Salina area could see the worst of it.\nThe forecast for the storm, which is expected to arrive Saturday and continue through Sunday night, shows a band in central Kansas stretching from a little west of Hutchinson, north to about Interstate 70, and east to the Kansas-Missouri line getting ice accumulation of a quarter of an inch up to about half of an inch.\nLooking at the snowfall forecast, a band of north-central to northeast Kansas has the highest projected totals of nine to 12 inches of accumulation. Salina braces for impact as the city is in the targeted areas to get the thickest ice and the heaviest snow.\nAhead of the storm, Storm Team 12 Meteorologist Adrian Campa offered the following insight into what Kansans can expect:\n“Rain, wintry mix, & widespread snowfall are likely. Major impacts to travel, especially Sunday due to blowing snow, possible major icing, and low visibility are all likely. Power outages are also possible as winds will be gusting over 35mph at times. Now is the time to prepare! We also will have dangerously cold air moving in Sunday night! Please make sure you’re staying up to date on the forecast!”\nThe City of Salina is making preparations for the storm. This includes salting all of the city’s bridge decks and elevated surfaces.\n“Salt trucks are equipped and staff will be on standby ready to deploy when the need arises,” the City of Salina said.\nThe city advises drivers “to allow ample space when approaching salt trucks from behind, as the equipment will be distributing salt on the roadway.\n‘Driving too closely to the equipment could present additional challenges and safety concerns for operators and other motorists,” the City of Salina warned.\nFor more information on the storm or snow removal operations, Salina advises the public to visit the city’s website at http://www.salina-ks.gov/ , the city’s Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/salina.ks.gov/ or to call its General Services office at 785-309-5750.\nLooking at the expected impact on state highways, including Interstate 70, Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner shared tips on staying safe in the winter weather.\n“Being weather aware. I’m doing that, our troopers are doing that, getting your vehicles well prepared for travels, leaving well in advance before the storm arrives,” Gardner said. “If you are needing to travel, really evaluate that, should you be making the trip or could you stay home and just delay?”\nIn Salina on Thursday, 12 News spoke with a traveler who said he’s prepared and is starting his trip earlier than initially planned to beat the storm as he drives on I-70.\n“I’ve got everything. I’ve got blankets and I have a dog, so I got dog food and stuff for cold and food, (a) cooler, the whole bit,” traveler David Keenan said. “I’ve probably got 10 to 12 hours left and I’ll just keep going to make sure that I get there.”\nGardner offered further insight into what the Salina area should look out for with up to a foot of snow on top of a bed of ice.\n“It’s going to create some difficulties because we’re going to be working a lot of slide-offs leading up to the snow hitting on top of it, and then when the snow arrives, we’re going to have motorists not realizing there are some slick spots underneath that snow,” he said.\nAside from slick spots, there’s another thing to keep in mind: highway closures.\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if we see I-70 shut down,” Gardner said. “When hotels get closed down or filled up and road conditions worsen, they’ll start further eastward, shutting down more and more of the roadway all the way up I-70 and the [Interstate] 135 junction.”\nThe KHP advises calling STAR 47 if your vehicle breaks down or if you see another vehicle broken down. The highway patrol also stresses the importance of wearing your seatbelt at all times when you’re on the road.\nCopyright 2025 KWCH. All rights reserved.
