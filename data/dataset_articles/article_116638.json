  "text": "FIRST ALERT: Slippery travel as lake effect snow continues\nMARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) -\nPlan on hazardous travel conditions as roads will be slippery with occasional limited visibility from blowing snow across portions of the U.P. This for the western and eastern counties as lake effect snow showers persist along the northwest wind belts. Intensities will generally be light to moderate, but could briefly be heavy. This slowly tapers off tomorrow. Most of the U.P. will remain dry throughout the weekend with cold conditions. Additional snow over the next three days will range 3-6″ in the higher elevations of the Western counties. The Eastern counties of Alger, Luce, and Northern Schoolcraft could have ranges of 6-10″. Portions of the North Central, areas like Baraga and Marquette counties will have minimal snow, but amounts will range 1-3″ with less than inch in the city of Marquette. The pattern remains colder than normal, which will keep on and off lake effect snow in the forecast into next week.\nToday: Light to moderate lake effect snow showers Western & Eastern counties\n>Highs: Upper teens west, low 20s east\nSaturday: Light snow showers north\n>Highs: Single number west, mid to upper teens east\nSunday: Mostly cloudy with spotty snow east\n>Highs: Upper teens to low 20s\nMonday: Mostly cloudy with spotty snow\n>Highs: Upper teens west, low 20s east\nTuesday: Light snow showers north\n>Highs: Upper teens to low 20s\nWednesday: Light to moderate lake effect snow showers along northwest wind belts\n>Highs: Mid to upper teens\nThursday: Mostly cloudy and cold\n>Highs: Mid to upper teens\nCopyright 2025 WLUC.
