  "text": "Saskatchewan’s two largest cities are under an extreme cold warning Friday morning as wind chill values near -40 C along with temperatures in the -30 C range are expected to hang around through the weekend.\nAlong with Regina and Saskatoon, Moose Jaw and Prince Albert, as well as the Battlefords and Kindersley are also under the warning from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC).\nAccording to ECCC, the bitterly cold weather is expected to moderate on Sunday.\n“Frostbit can develop within minutes on exposed skin, especially with wind chill,” ECCC said on its website.\nPeople are also reminded to dress in layers that can be removed if they get too warm, with an outer layer that is water resistant.\nIn Regina on Friday the daytime high is expected to be just -27 C, Saskatoon is similar with a high of just -26 C.\nNormal daytime highs for both cities this time of year is about -10 C.\nAn extreme cold warning is also in effect for far northern parts of Saskatchewan.\nTemperatures are expected to be milder next week.",
