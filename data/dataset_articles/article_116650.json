  "text": "Blustery weather hit the coast in the late afternoon on Christmas Day, resulting in damage from downed trees and branches that left a number of area residents without power for an extended period of time. A high gust sometime between 3 and 4 a.m. on Thursday, Dec. 26, knocked down this tree on Northwest Lee Avenue in Lincoln City, which severely damaged a car and also took out power lines across the street. Power crews along the coast were called out late on Christmas Day, and many worked through the night to restore power, although some homes were still left in the dark for much of the following day.
