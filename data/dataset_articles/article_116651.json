  "text": "Read full article BBC Snow expected to cause disruption in parts of West Ian Fergusson - Senior weather presenter, BBC West January 3, 2025 at 3:44 p.m. · 2 min read Link Copied Parts of the West - especially across Gloucestershire - are likely to see snow developing later on Saturday, with disruption possible [Ian Fergusson]\nSnow and ice look set to cause disruption in parts of the West this weekend.\nA Met Office yellow warning, covering all but the far south of the region, comes into force at midday on Saturday.\nOn Friday the Met Office issued an amber warning for snow and ice, covering all of Gloucestershire and northwards into the Midlands, which starts from 6pm on Saturday.\nSnow will turn to rain as the evening unfolds but the rate at which this happens will vary from south to north.\nSnow will persist for longer in northern parts of the region, especially across the Cotswolds.\nWhere snow will fall is uncertain The forecast is a classically awkward one for this region, with milder air following from the south west causing initial snow to change to sleet, then rain.\nADVERTISEMENT Key uncertainties in this region are multi-fold - the main one is just where snow will first start to appear.\nSome forecast computer models indicate this happening across central parts of Somerset during the mid-afternoon and onwards, with the snow risk then quickly spreading northwards up to Gloucestershire into the evening and at least initially into the night.\nConversely however, other models are much less bullish.\nWith the exception of highest ground - for example the Quantocks, or Mendip plateau - these other simulations foresee mostly rain falling anywhere south of about Bristol, with snow only starting to appear from around the M4 northwards.\nSo for certain, this will be a tricky forecast in terms of local detail and emphasis.\nNonetheless, for all our areas broadly north of Bristol the risk of snow is considerably higher and the Met Office amber warning reflects that likelihood.\nSmall margins of distance, elevation and timing will be crucial as to whether rain or snow falls by late Saturday for anywhere broadly south of the M4 [BBC] Freezing rain an added risk\nThe Met Office amber warning makes specific reference to a risk of \"freezing rain\".\nADVERTISEMENT This is a very specific meteorological phenomenon but rare here - and thankfully so.\nWhere it occurs, freezing rain is especially treacherous .\nRaindrops literally freeze instantly on contact with any surfaces - be that pavements, roads, car windscreens, power lines, parked aircraft, or whatever else.\nConsequently, ice risks become especially profound and very dangerous.\nBy Sunday morning, milder air will have spread north across the entire region and the snow risk will have completely gone.\nFor Somerset, north Somerset, Wiltshire, Bristol and Bath the snow - where it has fallen - will likely have changed quite quickly to rain through the latter stages of Saturday.\nBut for those in Gloucestershire, especially the Cotswolds and Forest of Dean, the transition away from snow and associated ice risks will take longer.\nADVERTISEMENT Please keep across the weather warnings, as further revisions between now and Sunday remain possible.\nUseful links UK Met Office\nEnvironment Agency flood warnings\nBBC Weather\nMore on this story Amber warnings for snow with 'hazardous' travel conditions\nUnsettled New Year weather looms for West Country",
