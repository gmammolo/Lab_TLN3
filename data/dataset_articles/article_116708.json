In the Ionian they will blow northwest with intensities up to 4 Beaufort.\nIn the prefecture of Attica and the city of Athens sunshine is expected. The winds will blow north with intensities of 4-5 Beaufort and in the eastern parts 6 Beaufort.

From midday in the northern Ionian and gradually in Epirus clouds will develop and rains and scattered thunderstorms will occur.\nThe winds will blow in the west west-southwest 3 to 5 Beaufort and in the east from northern and from midday from southern directions with the same intensity.\nThe temperature will not show significant change.\nThe weather on Sunday 31 August\nIn the western and northern country clouds locally increased with local rains and scattered thunderstorms. Gradual improvement will present the weather from the morning in the west and from the afternoon in the north. In the rest of the country generally clear weather with a few local clouds in Thessaly.\nThe winds will blow from western directions 3 to 5 and from midday in the western and southern seas locally up to 6 Beaufort.\nThe temperature will show a drop in the west and north.\nAsk me anything\nExplore related questions",
