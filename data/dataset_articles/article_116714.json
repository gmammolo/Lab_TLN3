  "text": "Tamil Nadu News\nTamil Nadu Weather Alert: Heavy rain forecast for Nilgiris, Coimbatore for next 2 days\nThe hilly regions of Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts have been placed under special watch with forecasts indicating heavy rainfall at isolated places on August 28 and 29. In Chennai, residents can expect partly cloudy skies with possibilities of moderate rainfall accompanied by thunder and lightning in some areas.\nChennai: The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a weather alert predicting widespread rainfall across Tamil Nadu for the coming days, with particular emphasis on the Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts which are expected to receive heavy precipitation. This weather development comes as a deep low-pressure system has formed over the northwest Bay of Bengal off the Odisha coast, which intensified from a low-pressure area recorded on August 28 to its current status by August 29.\nThe system is projected to move west-northwest towards Odisha within the next 24 hours, influencing weather patterns across eastern and southern India. The meteorological conditions are expected to bring moderate rainfall to most parts of Tamil Nadu from August 28 through September 2, accompanied by strong surface winds reaching 40-50 kmph in some areas.\nChennai weather alert\nThe hilly regions of Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts have been placed under special watch with forecasts indicating heavy rainfall at isolated places on August 28 and 29. In Chennai, residents can expect partly cloudy skies with possibilities of moderate rainfall accompanied by thunder and lightning in some areas. The city is likely to experience maximum temperatures around 35°C and minimum temperatures between 27-28°C. Notably, the Puducherry and Karaikal regions are expected to see temperatures 2-3 degrees above normal.\nThe weather department’s warning follows consistent rainfall across Tamil Nadu over the past week, particularly in southern districts and Western Ghats border regions. While Chennai has been experiencing intermittent light showers with sunny intervals, authorities are advising citizens to stay updated with official weather bulletins and exercise necessary precautions during this period of intensified monsoon activity.\nClick for more latest Tamil Nadu news.
