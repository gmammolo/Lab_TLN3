  "text": "Spokane, Wash. – Lightning, heavy rain, and the threat of mudslides are sweeping across southeastern Washington and central Idaho Wednesday afternoon, with the potential for dangerous travel and flash flooding in burn scar zones.\nAccording to the National Weather Service Spokane office, scattered thunderstorms are embedded in a wider band of rain moving northeast across the region as of 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. Heavier showers and lightning strikes have been spotted from Wenatchee to Lewiston, with radar indicating the most active cells around Moses Lake, Pasco, and Pullman.\nThe primary concern remains steep terrain and recent wildfire burn areas, where intense rainfall could trigger rock and mudslides. Areas around Clarkia, ID and parts of the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests are particularly vulnerable.\nTravelers along U.S. Route 195, I-90, and Highway 12 should remain alert for rapidly changing road conditions. Outdoor recreation is discouraged in areas prone to slides. Residents in burn scar areas should prepare for potential flash flooding and avoid low-lying zones.\nThe NWS says rain and embedded storms will continue into the evening, with additional updates expected by early Thursday.",
