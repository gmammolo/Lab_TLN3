  "text": "Cleveland, Ohio – Another cool night is ahead for northern Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania, though not as cold as Tuesday, thanks to increasing cloud cover. Overnight lows will dip into the low to mid-50s across most communities, while interior valleys could fall into the upper 40s.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Cleveland, the coldest spots will be interior northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania, and sheltered valleys near the U.S. 30 corridor. Erie, Meadville, and Youngstown could all bottom out near 50 degrees, while Akron, Canton, and Cleveland remain closer to the mid-50s.\nThe cool stretch may have residents reaching for light jackets by early morning, especially in rural valleys where frost-like chill may be felt on windshields. Drivers should be prepared for slightly damp and slick conditions on shaded roadways at daybreak.\nLooking ahead, the region will remain seasonably cool through the weekend, with clouds increasing and only gradual warming expected. No frost concerns are expected at this time, but nighttime temperatures will stay below normal.",
