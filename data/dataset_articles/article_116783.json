  "text": "Heavy rains have caused flooding in the Nay Pyi Taw Council area, according to sources.\nFrom the night of August 26 to the afternoon of August 27, continuous rains in Nay Pyi Taw, Union Territory, have caused flooding and overflowing of the old Yangon-Mandalay Road in Zeyathiri Township and in Gyottan Village, Inn Thar Village, and Thayar Su Village in Pyinmana Township.\nIn order to prevent people from having difficulty in traveling due to the heavy rains, military personnel, Myanmar Police Force members, Red Cross members, and fire fighters are working together to ensure that people are not in danger and travel smoothly, and are helping to evacuate people from areas where water is entering.\nThe tropical depression that formed over the border areas of Laos and Thailand has weakened into a low-pressure cell and is crossing northern Thailand.\nDue to the intensity of the low-pressure cell, rain and thunderstorms will be fairly widespread to widespread in Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Magway, Sagaing, Ayeyawady, Tanintharyi regions, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Chin, Mon, Rakhine and Shan states, with isolated and scattered heavy rains in some areas, the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) has announced.",
