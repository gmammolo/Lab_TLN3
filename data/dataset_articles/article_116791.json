  "text": "Yamuna river flows above danger mark in Delhi\nThe Yamuna river in Delhi flowed above the danger mark, reaching 205.35 metres at the Old Railway Bridge by 8 pm on Wednesday.\nThe water level remained above the warning mark of 204.50 metres for the second consecutive day, prompting heightened vigilance from authorities. The Central Water Commission (CWC) had issued a flood warning on Tuesday evening, predicting the river would cross the danger mark by Wednesday evening.\nThe surge is primarily attributed to substantial water releases from the Wazirabad and Hathnikund barrages, with 41,206 cusecs and 55,830 cusecs water discharged hourly, respectively.\nWater from these barrages takes approximately 48 to 50 hours to reach Delhi, contributing to the rising levels. An official from the central flood room noted that even reduced upstream discharges are elevating the river’s levels, with forecasts suggesting further increases.\nThe CWC has directed officials to monitor the situation closely, warn people living close to river embankments, and prepare for potential evacuations, which are triggered when the water level reaches 206 metres.\nThe Old Railway Bridge remains a critical monitoring point for assessing flood risks. Authorities are on high alert, ready to evacuate communities if necessary, as Delhi braces for potential flooding.\nUnlock Exclusive Insights with The Tribune Premium\nTake your experience further with Premium access.\nThought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nAlready a Member?
