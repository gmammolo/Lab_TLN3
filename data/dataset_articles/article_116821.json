  "text": "Nizamabad: Incessant rains continued to lash Kamareddy and other parts of the erstwhile Nizamabad district on Thursday, throwing normal life out of gear.\nSeveral colonies in Kamareddy remained marooned, while vast stretches of agricultural fields were inundated. In view of the situation, the District Collectors declared a holiday for schools and colleges in both Kamareddy and Nizamabad.\nHeavy rains caused severe damage to National Highway 44 at Kyasampally in Kamareddy, disrupting the key north-south corridor. With traffic suspended, transport vehicles were stranded on either side, and officials began temporary repair works to restore movement.\nMeanwhile, inflows into the Pocharam project in Nagireddy mandal caused concern on Wednesday after the reservoir received 1.50 lakh cusecs of water. Though inflows have since receded slightly, officials remain on alert. A large pit formed near the project due to soil erosion, and the situation is being monitored closely.",
