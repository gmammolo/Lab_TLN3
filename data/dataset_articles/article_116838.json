  "text": "In Telangana, extremely heavy rain battered Kamareddy, Medak, and Nirmal districts. Several other areas across the state received heavy rainfall. Many villages have been inundated while towns and cities witnessed flooding as streams and lakes overflowed. Medak, Kamareddy and Nirmal have been the worst hit with Argonda in Kamareddy district recording the highest rainfall of 43.1 cms till 5 this morning. The National and State Disaster Relief Teams have rescued over 1000 persons in Kamareddy districts.\nThe state Government has appointed special officers to the worst-hit districts to take necessary relief activities at the ground level. The District Collectors and SPs have been directed to remain alert and take all necessary measures to ensure no loss of life and property. Chief Minister A Revanth Reddy will conduct an aerial survey of the rain-hit areas today. Met officials warned of heavy and very heavy rains likely at some places today and tomorrow under the influence of the low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal.\nMeanwhile, in the Medak district, incessant rains flooded several areas, and people are facing severe hardships. The Indian Army deployed its teams of Flood Relief Columns to take up comprehensive Flood Relief operations in close coordination with the NDRF and SDRF. The Southern Command of the Indian Army posted on social media that its Engineering Task Forces (ETF) are clearing obstacles & restoring connectivity, while Medical Teams are providing urgent care to the affected. The Army is evacuating stranded people with specialised boats, essential equipment and skilled troops. It is relocating stranded people to safer locations and distributing relief material.",
