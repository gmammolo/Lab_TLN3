  "text": "Jammu and Kashmir is facing one of its worst rain disasters. A red alert has been issued after torrential rains, cloudbursts, and flash floods wreaked havoc across the region. A major bridge on the Tawi River collapsed, highways have been blocked by landslides, and vehicles stranded for hours. In Udhampur, a car was crushed under an uprooted tree, while in Doda more than 10 houses were damaged by a cloudburst. Pilgrimages like Vaishno Devi and Shiv Khori have been suspended, schools and offices closed, and rescue teams including the Army, NDRF and police are racing against time. With rivers swelling above danger marks, authorities warn the next 24 hours could worsen the crisis.",
