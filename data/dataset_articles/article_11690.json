  "text": "Nithin Kamath, Zerodha’s Chief Executive Officer Takes a Swing at Stock Market Holiday Today\nZerodha’s Chief Executive Officer, Nithin Kamath, was very direct, referring to today’s market closure for the municipal elections in Mumbai as “poor planning.” He believes that India’s stock markets are closely connected to global money flows and that stopping trading for a local election sends the wrong message to foreign investors. To support his point, Kamath even quoted famed investor Charlie Munger: “Show me the incentive, and I’ll show you the outcome.” But is he right? While the global investment community may be disappointed, others argue that civic responsibilities and good governance also matter. Either way, Kamath’s remarks have sparked debate, markets may be quiet, but the conversation is anything but.\nIndian stock exchanges are closed today for Mumbai’s municipal elections.\nThe fact that our exchanges, which have international linkages, are shut down for a local municipal election shows poor planning and a serious lack of appreciation for second-order effects.\nAs Munger…\n— Nithin Kamath (@Nithin0dha)\n[January 15, 2026]\nAishwarya is a journalism graduate with over three years of experience thriving in the buzzing corporate media world.
