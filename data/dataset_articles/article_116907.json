  "text": "Odisha is set to experience another spell of intense rainfall, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing multiple warnings as a deepening low-pressure system over the northwest Bay of Bengal continues to impact weather across the state.\nAs per the latest bulletin, the IMD has cautioned that showers accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning are likely to persist for the next two days, with several districts placed under special alerts.\nStatewide Yellow Warning, Five Districts on Alert\nOn Thursday, the IMD issued a yellow warning for the entire state for lightning and gusty winds. The districts of Bargarh, Bolangir, Nuapada, Kalahandi, and Nabarangpur have been placed under heightened alert for the possibility of heavy rainfall, with winds expected to reach speeds of 30 to 40 kmph.\nSouthern Odisha is forecast to bear the brunt of the system. While most districts remain under yellow warnings, Malkangiri has been issued an orange alert, signalling the likelihood of heavy to very heavy showers. Other vulnerable districts include Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Ganjam, Kandhamal, Nayagarh, Khordha, and Puri.\nALSO READ: Coal-laden trailer truck swept away in floodwater in Sundargarh, driver missing\nLow-Pressure Over Bay of Bengal Intensifies\nAccording to the IMD, a cyclonic circulation over the west-central Bay of Bengal has intensified into a low-pressure area, strengthening the monsoon current. The IMD said that widespread rain is likely to continue until at least August 29, before gradually reducing in intensity to light or moderate levels between August 30 and September 1.\nThe weather department also warned that the system could further intensify, sustaining wet conditions well into the first week of September. Both coastal and interior districts are expected to see prolonged rainfall activity under its influence.\nFlood Woes Deepen in Several Regions\nThe renewed rainfall comes at a time when Odisha is already grappling with flood-related challenges. Earlier this week, a breach in the Kani River embankment in Jajpur district inundated villages, damaging farmlands and homes.\nIn Balasore, the Subarnarekha River unleashed its fifth flood of the season, leaving hundreds of villages across Baliapal, Jaleswar, and Bhograi blocks marooned. Road connectivity has been cut off in several areas, and thousands of hectares of standing crops remain submerged.",
