  "text": "Severe weather is approaching Italy, with rain and a risk of hail, a top weatherman said Wednesday.\n The weather will worsen starting in the Northwest in the next few hours, with increasing clouds and the first showers. The rain will then move south, and Sunday will be sunny, said Lorenzo Tedici, media meteorologist for iLMeteo.it..\n According to Tedici, the cause of this deterioration is \"former Hurricane Erin, which over its 13,000 km (8,000 mi) journey has undergone a transformation: it has transformed from a tropical cyclone with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) to a colder and less intense North Atlantic cyclone; it will push 'spirals of bad weather' toward our country, directly from the British Isles.\" According to the expert, the day to be marked in red in Italy will be Thursday, August 28th.\n ;;\"During a 24-hour period of severe weather, rainfall is forecast with at least 100-150 liters per square meter in the north (with hail as well), more likely in Piedmont, Lombardy, and Liguria, but widespread across much of the country.\" \"The worsening conditions will immediately affect northern Tuscany,\" he adds, \"and then from Friday will hit the entire central-northern region with thunderstorms from west to east.\" \"All of this will also be accompanied by stronger winds: initially from the Sirocco, some of which are strong between Wednesday and Thursday, then from the Libeccio until Saturday.\n \"According to the latest information,\" Tedici emphasizes, \"on Saturday it will also rain in the south, but Sunday will be fine.\n \"In the next few hours, we will also have a rapid rise of warm air from North Africa towards Sardinia and the central-southern region, with widespread peaks of 33-34°C and peaks of 38°C in Sardinia.\" In detail: - Wednesday 27th. In the north: worsening with thunderstorms, some of which are strong, less so in the northeast. Central Italy: Mostly sunny, with occasional showers in Tuscany; warm. South: Sunny and very hot.\n - Thursday 28th. North: Severe weather with heavy rainfall, especially in the northwest. Central Italy: Worsening in Tuscany with heavy showers, clouds, and heat elsewhere. Warm. South: Sunny and very hot.\n - Friday 29th. North: Severe weather. Central Italy: Severe weather in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Warm. South: Worsening throughout the day. Outlook: Rain towards the south, gradually improving elsewhere; sunny on Sunday.",
