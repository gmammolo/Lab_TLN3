  "text": "BJP questions CM Sukhu’s Bihar visit as Himachal battles rain fury, seeks Assembly deferment\nAccusing the government of being non-serious on the issue of relief and restoration in view of the havoc wreaked by rains, the opposition BJP on Thursday demanded deferment of the assembly session due to the rain disaster.\nOpposition legislators from Chamba—Hans Raj, Janak Raj, and DS Thakur—expressed concern over the absence of Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu from the state at such a critical juncture.\n“When the situation in the state is so critical, the CM should have been here rather than attending a political function in Bihar,” said Leader of Opposition (LoP) Jai Ram Thakur.\nResponding to the concerns of the opposition, Deputy Chief Minister Mukesh Agnohotri said an impression was being created that the government was not doing anything.\n“Like you all, we too are equally concerned about the situation, but do not try to give it a political tinge. The LoP is trying to give the issue a political colour, though the entire government is working overtime to ensure that relief and restoration work is in full swing,” he said.\nAgnihotri said the entire state has been affected, with Chamba being the worst hit. The Chief Secretary is in constant contact with the DCs and monitoring the situation round the clock, he said. The Pathankot-Chamba road was opened at 1 a.m., and 3,000 people have been rescued from the Manimahesh route, he added.\nEnraged at accusations made by the Deputy CM of politicising the issue, the entire opposition was on its feet, raising slogans. Finally, the Speaker adjourned the house amidst pandemonium.\nLeader of Opposition (LoP) Jai Ram Thakur said initially Mandi was the worst affected, but as the monsoons progressed, the damage has spread to other parts.\n“Chamba has been hit very badly, especially during the Manimahesh Yatra. The most serious aspect is that there is no contact, as all communication has been cut off in Chamba,” he said. He said the road beyond Pandoh in Mandi has been damaged, and people, including tourists, are stranded at various locations.\nThakur said that by now, helicopter services should have been requisitioned to evacuate people and get rations dropped to them. “At such a time, the CM should have been here when disaster struck Himachal. It is ironic that he is busy attending a political programme in Bihar when the state is passing through a critical phase,” Thakur said. He urged the Speaker to intervene and ensure proper arrangements.\nHans Raj said the rain disaster damage in Manimahesh is huge. The situation in Kullu-Manali, Chamba, Pangi, and Lahaul-Spiti is very serious. “The Chief Minister should have stayed here and monitored the situation personally,” he said. There is 1.5 feet of snow at Saach Pass, and vehicles carrying rations have also gotten stranded en route, with no contact, he added.\nBharmour MLA Janak Raj said that for the last 72 hours, there has been no connectivity in Bharmour, and the Khara Mukh-Chamba road is in very bad shape, with thousands of people stranded on the route. “When three districts of the state have witnessed unprecedented devastation, the state government should have been more serious,” said Bharmour MLA Janak Raj.\nVidhan Sabha Speaker Kuldeep Pathania said if there is a consensus on deferring the assembly session with the consent of the Parliamentary Affairs Minister and the LoP, then he was in agreement.\nThe Speaker said that in the last 72 hours, due to incessant rains, almost all districts have suffered damage, with Chamba being the worst hit. “What is worse is that there is no mobile connectivity with Chamba. The situation is very critical in Bharmour, Tissa, Holi, and Salooni,” he said. “I admit that the situation is critical, and it is for all of you to decide whether the assembly session should be deferred,” he said.\nUnlock Exclusive Insights with The Tribune Premium\nTake your experience further with Premium access.\nThought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nAlready a Member?
