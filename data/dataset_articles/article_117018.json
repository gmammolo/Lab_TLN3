  "text": "Next Article\nHimachal: Thousands of vehicles, including trucks, stuck on highway\nSince June 20, heavy monsoon rains have caused major landslides on the Chandigarh-Kullu highway (NH-21), blocking several key spots.\nThousands of vehicles—including trucks loaded with fruits and veggies—are stuck, with drivers forced to wait for days.\nMain route to transport perishable goods\nThe blocked highway is a lifeline for Himachal Pradesh, especially for moving over ₹50 crore worth of perishable goods.\nWith both main and alternate routes often closed due to swollen rivers and damaged roads, power and water services have also taken a hit.\nTragically, since June 20 at least 158 people have lost their lives to the heavy rains and landslides, with dozens still missing as repair work continues through tough weather.",
