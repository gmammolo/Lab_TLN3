This is the second time this season that the danger level was breached. Central Water Commission's data showed that the river surpassed the warning level of 204.5 metres on Tuesday. Due to high discharges from Hathnikund Barrage and heavy rain in the upper reaches of Yamuna, the water level showed a rising trend from Wednesday. Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator, South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), said, \"Yamuna River in Delhi is receiving over 60,000 cusecs hourly discharges from the Hathnikund barrage for the past two days. The high discharges have kept the water level above the warning level.\" The water level in Delhi also crossed the danger level on Aug 18 and 19, but it later dipped. According to the irrigation and flood control department, evacuation from low-lying areas will begin once water levels reach 206 metres. The highest water level recorded was 208.6 metres in 2023 when Delhi experienced the Yamuna floods. That year, the highest discharge from Hathnikund Barrage was more than 350,000 cusecs, with many hourly discharges of over 100,000 cusecs. The water level of 207.5 metres was seen in the floods of 1978. It stood at 207.1 metres in 2010 and 207.3 metres in 2013. The river has not witnessed any flood spell in 2024. Meanwhile, several parts of Delhi received light to moderate rain on Wednesday with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting light to very light showers over the next five days. According to the IMD, Ayanagar in southwest Delhi logged 29.3mm of rainfall from 8.30am to 5.30pm. Safdarjung, which is the city's base weather station, received 13.4mm of rainfall, Pusa 18.5mm, Lodhi Road 9.8mm, Palam 6.2mm, Mayur Vihar 4.2mm and Ridge in north Delhi 1.8mm. \"Active monsoon conditions are likely to prevail over Delhi during the next four to five days. A spell of very light to light rain or thundershowers is likely at a few places during midnight to early hours on Wednesday. There is a possibility of very light to light rain during the subsequent five days,\" said an IMD official. The maximum temperature was recorded at 30.6 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal. It was 31.6 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The relative humidity oscillated between 87% and 97%. The minimum temperature stood at 24.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. Delhi's air quality, meanwhile, continued to stay in the 'satisfactory' category with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 71. It was 55 the previous day. The air quality is expected to stay in the satisfactory category for the next few days. According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain in the 'satisfactory' range till Aug 30. \"The outlook for the subsequent six days from Aug 30 is that the AQI is likely to be in the moderate to satisfactory category,\" it said.\nSelect The Times of India as your preferred source on Google Search .\nStay updated with the latest local news from your city on Times of India (TOI).
