  "text": "By Matthew Euzarraga Spencer Gustafson ,\n9 hours ago\nNEW YORK (PIX11) – Verizon customers in New York City might be able to see account “credits,” according to a statement posted Wednesday evening on an official Verizon social media page.\n“Today, we let many of our customers down, and for that, we are truly sorry. They expect more from us.\nWe are working non-stop and making progress. Our teams will continue to work through the night until service is restored for all impacted customers.\nWe will make this right – for any customer affected, we will provide account credits and share updates soon.”\nMore Local News Verizon customers across major cities were affected by outages on Wednesday, according to Downdetector .\nBoston, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Phoenix were other major cities where Verizon customers reported outages, according to Downdetector’s outage map .\nOutages began around 12:30 p.m., with more than 100,000 customers reporting them. This prompted the cellular company to issue a statement saying, “Engineers are engaged and working to identify and resolve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.”\nThough service was eventually restored for some customers, more than 20,000 customers were still reporting outages late Wednesday evening, according to Downdetector .\nAround 11:00 p.m., New York City time, Verizon issued a statement to PIX11 News stating the outage had been resolved. They encourage customers to restart their devices to reconnect to the network.\nMatthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.
