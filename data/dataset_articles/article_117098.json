  "text": "Weather News\nThunderstorms with marble-sized hail in Greater Pickens Thursday, says the NWS\nThe creation of this content included the use of AI based on templates created, reviewed and edited by journalists in the newsroom. Read more on our AI policy here.\nA report from the NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC was issued on Thursday at 4:55 p.m. for strong thunderstorms until 5:30 p.m. for Greater Pickens.\nBrace for marble-sized hail (0.5 inches) and wind gusts of up to 50 mph.\n\"At 4:55 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm 6 miles north of Clemson, or near Six Mile. This storm was nearly stationary,\" comments the NWS. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to outdoor objects is possible.\"\nThe NWS adds, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. If on or near Lake Keowee, get out of the water and move indoors or inside a vehicle. Remember, lightning can strike out to 10 miles from the parent thunderstorm. If you can hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning. Move to safe shelter now! Do not be caught on the water in a thunderstorm.\"\nThis alert is in effect until 5:30 p.m.\nActions to take when lightning threat is imminent\nLightning hits the United States approximately 25 million times annually. The majority of these strikes happen during the summer, causing around 20 fatalities each year, according to the NWS. The likelihood of lightning increases as a thunderstorm gets closer and reaches its highest point when the storm is directly overhead. This risk decreases as the storm moves away.\nHere are suggestions for staying safe during a thunderstorm:\n- To minimize risk of being struck by lightning, when going outside, have a plan to get to a safer place.\n- If the sky becomes menacing and thunder becomes audible, seek out a safe place to seek shelter.\n- Once indoors, avoid touching corded phones, electrical equipment, plumbing, and windows and doors.\n- Wait for 30 minutes after the most recent lightning or thunder before venturing outside.\nIf finding indoor shelter is not an option:\n- Stay away from open fields, hill summits, or ridge tops.\n- Avoid tall, isolated trees or other elevated objects. If you are in a forest, stick to areas with shorter tree cover.\n- If you are with a group, fan out to stop the current from transmitting between members.\n- If you are camping in an open area, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low area. Remember, a tent offers no protection from lighting.\n- Stay away from water, wet items, and metal objects. Water and metal do not attract lightning but they are excellent conductors of electricity.\nWhat steps to follow when driving in the rain?\n- Switch on headlights - Even during daylight hours, using headlights can enhance visibility and signal your presence to other drivers.\n- On the road - Drive in the middle lanes and stay on high ground. Rainwater tends to stockpile on the edges of roads.\n- Steer clear of puddles - Driving into puddles or low areas of rainwater can cause vehicles to hydroplane or skid out of control.\n- Give ample space to large vehicles - Trucks or buses can create a water spray that diminishes visibility.\n- Steer clear of flooded areas - When coming to a flooded road, turn around and head back. Flash flooding currents are strong and can sweep drivers off roadways. Driving through deep water can also affect a vehicle's mechanical and electrical systems.\nWhat is hydroplaning?\nHydroplaning occurs when a vehicle begins to slide uncontrollably on wet roads.\nThis happens when water in front of the tire builds up faster than the vehicle's weight can push water out of the way. The water pressure then causes the vehicle to rise and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road, making the driver lose control. The top three contributors to hydroplaning are:\n- Vehicle speed - When a vehicle's speed increases, the tire-traction grip and ability to control the vehicle decreases. Drive at a reduced speed during wet weather.\n- Water depth - The deeper the water, the sooner a vehicle loses traction on the road. It doesn't matter how deep the water is, even a thin layer can lead to hydroplaning.\n- Tire tread depth - Checking your tire tread before hitting the road is important, as low or no tread can lead to sliding.\nIn the event of your vehicle hydroplaning, here's what to know:\n- Ease off the accelerator - Step off the gas to slow down the vehicle until the tires find traction.\n- Turn into the skid - Turning into the skid can help the vehicle's tires realign to regain control.\n- Make sure the tires reconnect with the road - During the skid, wait until the tires reconnect with the road and then gently straighten the wheels to regain control.\n- Brake gently as needed - Brake normally if the vehicle has anti-lock brakes and pump brakes gently if in an older vehicle.\nSource: The National Weather Service\nThis story was originally published August 21, 2025 at 5:00 PM.",
