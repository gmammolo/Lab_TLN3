  "text": "Monsoon threat persists, next 15 days critical: Div Com Kashmir\nGK Web Desk\nSrinagar, Aug 28: Divisional Commissioner Kashmir, Anshul Garg, on Thursday praised the people of Kashmir for their courage and cooperation in dealing with the recent flood situation. He said the next 10–15 days are crucial and urged residents to strictly follow weather advisories.\nGarg said the water level in the Jhelum has receded but stressed that teams remain on “high alert.”\n“I would like to congratulate the people for managing the situation with calm and resilience. All teams were monitoring closely, but it is the citizens’ awareness and courage that made the difference,” he said while addressing a press conference at his office chamber, according to news agency Kashmir News Observer (KNO).\nHe emphasized that the coming days are critical, urging residents to stay vigilant, particularly near the Jhelum and its tributaries. “The next 40 days are important as the monsoon continues. With public support, our teams can handle any challenge,” he added.\nGarg appreciated the coordinated efforts of the Army, Police, SDRF, NDRF, and the Irrigation & Flood Control Department, noting that over 150 vulnerable spots were being monitored, with no breaches reported in the last 48 hours.\nHe said water levels at Ram Munshi Bagh and Sangam have receded, reflecting effective departmental work as well as community cooperation. He also urged citizens to share suggestions for long-term flood preparedness.\nThe Divisional Commissioner reassured residents that the situation is under control and expressed confidence that continued cooperation will help keep Kashmir safe during the monsoon season. —(KNO)",
