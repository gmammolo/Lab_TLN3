  "text": "A low-pressure system that formed near the Odisha coast over the southwest Bay of Bengal has intensified, meaning Kerala is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall for the next five days, starting on Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has announced the possibility of isolated heavy rainfall in the state until Friday, August 29. Heavy rainfall is expected in various districts, particularly in the northern regions of Kerala. The IMD has issued a Yellow Alert for the Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod districts. Fishermen are advised to be cautious as the sea is likely to remain rough. Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Malappuram districts are likely to experience moderate rainfall in isolated places and strong winds reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h on Thursday. Malayalam media reports stated that the IMD has said all other districts may experience moderate rainfall in isolated places along with strong winds reaching speeds of up to 40 km/h. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines \"heavy rain\" as rainfall ranging from 64.5 mm to 115.5 mm within a 24-hour period. Along the Kerala-Karnataka coasts, strong winds with speeds ranging from 40 to 50 km/h, gusting up to 60 km/h at times, along with rough weather, are expected on Thursday. Similarly, strong winds (40 to 50 km/h, gusting up to 60 km/h at times) and rough weather are also forecast for the Lakshadweep coast until Friday. Incessant rain due to the low-pressure system has led to flooding in many parts of Odisha. The southern districts of Koraput, Malkangiri, and Nabarangpur were the most affected. Authorities reported that over a hundred villages in the northern region have been cut off due to rising river water levels.",
