  "text": "Wichita, Kan. – Drivers across central and southern Kansas face a heightened flood risk Thursday morning as heavy rainfall continues to push rivers and low-water crossings toward dangerous levels.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Wichita, a Flood Watch remains in effect until 1 p.m. for more than 20 counties, including Sedgwick, Reno, Saline, Butler, Cowley, Montgomery, and Labette. Officials warn that excessive runoff may quickly overwhelm streams, creeks, and flood-prone neighborhoods.\nWichita, Derby, and Newton could see street flooding during the morning commute, especially in poorly drained areas. In Salina, Marion, and McPherson, low-lying rural roads are expected to remain difficult to travel. Farther southeast, communities such as Coffeyville, Independence, and Parsons may experience flooding near the Neosho and Verdigris Rivers.\nEmergency officials urge residents not to drive through standing water. Just two feet of fast-moving water can sweep vehicles off the roadway. Barricades should not be bypassed, and overnight travelers are advised to exercise extra caution.\nThe Flood Watch is expected to expire early this afternoon, though additional alerts may be issued if rainfall continues.",
