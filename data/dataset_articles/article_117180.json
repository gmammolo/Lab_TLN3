  "text": "St. Paul, Minn. – Drivers across much of Minnesota could face dangerous travel Thursday morning as dense fog settles over the state, cutting visibility to a quarter mile or less.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Chanhassen, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 9 a.m. Thursday for central, southern, and western counties, including Kandiyohi, Brown, Dakota, Nicollet, and Rice. Visibility may drop suddenly overnight and during the early commute hours.\nThe advisory covers major roadways such as Highway 169 near Mankato, U.S. 212 in Carver County, and I-35 through Steele and Rice counties. Drivers in the Twin Cities metro, as well as in towns like Willmar, Hutchinson, New Ulm, and Red Wing, should expect significant delays and difficult travel conditions.\nTransportation officials urge motorists to slow down, use headlights, and maintain extra distance between vehicles. School buses and early morning commuters are advised to take additional precautions, with limited visibility expected through sunrise.\nThe fog is expected to gradually lift by mid-morning Thursday, but another advisory could be issued if low clouds persist.",
