  "text": "Springfield, Mo. – Roads across southwest Missouri and southeast Kansas may be water-covered this morning as heavy rain continues to trigger a flood watch through 1 p.m. Thursday. Drivers in low-lying areas, particularly near creeks and streams, face the highest risk of flash flooding.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Springfield, repeated rounds of thunderstorms have dropped several inches of rain overnight, with localized totals reaching 4 to 7 inches possible before the system exits later today. Counties under the watch include Barton, Jasper, Newton, Lawrence, McDonald, Barry, and Stone in Missouri, along with Bourbon, Crawford, and Cherokee in Kansas.\nEmergency managers warn that runoff could push rivers and streams out of their banks, especially in flood-prone locations such as Joplin, Carthage, Pittsburg, and Cassville. Motorists are urged to avoid driving through flooded roadways, as water levels can rise quickly and wash out pavement.\nThe heaviest rain is expected to taper by early afternoon, but saturated ground may keep creeks running high through the evening. Additional advisories could be issued if storms redevelop.",
