  "text": "Wenatchee, Washington – Thunderstorms are set to fire across the Cascades Thursday, bringing rain rates up to an inch per hour and a real threat of flash flooding and debris flows in steep terrain and near recent burn scars from Chelan to Okanogan counties. Drivers, hikers, and residents in canyons should plan for rapidly changing conditions and avoid low crossings.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Spokane, a Flood Watch is in effect Thursday morning through Thursday evening for Chelan and Okanogan counties, including the Pioneer and 25 Mile burn scars in Chelan County and the Cedar Creek, Cub Creek, Muckamuck, Walker Creek, and Eagle Bluff burn scars in Okanogan County.\nLocalized flooding and debris flows are possible near Winthrop, Mazama, Twisp, Chelan, Leavenworth, Omak, and Oroville. Expect slick travel on US-2 near Leavenworth, US-97/97A from Wenatchee to Okanogan, and SR-20 through the Methow Valley. If you live below a burn scar, keep phones charged, move vehicles off unpaved shoulders, and be ready to head to higher ground. Never drive across a flooded road.\nThe threat lasts through Thursday evening; additional advisories or Flash Flood Warnings may follow if storms repeatedly impact the same terrain.",
