  "text": "Duluth, Minn. – Drivers across northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin will face hazardous conditions Thursday morning as dense fog reduces visibility to a quarter mile or less in several counties.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Duluth, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 9 a.m. for Koochiching, Itasca, and St. Louis counties in Minnesota, along with Price, Ashland, Sawyer, and Iron counties in Wisconsin. Communities including Ely, International Falls, Hibbing, Grand Rapids, Ashland, Hayward, Hurley, and Phillips are all impacted.\nTravel is expected to be especially difficult on rural highways and near lakes and rivers where fog is thickest. The advisory also covers Tribal Lands including the Bois Forte Band, Bad River Reservation, Lac Courte Oreilles, and Lac du Flambeau, as well as Voyageurs National Park, Madeline Island, and portions of the Boundary Waters.\nOfficials urge drivers to slow down, use low-beam headlights, and leave extra space between vehicles. Morning commuters should allow extra travel time until conditions improve after sunrise.\nFog is expected to lift by midmorning, but forecasters warn additional advisories are possible later this week if similar overnight conditions develop.",
