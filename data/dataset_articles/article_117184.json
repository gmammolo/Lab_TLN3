  "text": "Seattle, Wash. – Mariners along Washington’s outer coast will contend with dangerous visibility conditions through Thursday morning as dense fog lingers offshore.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Seattle, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 11 a.m. Thursday for coastal waters stretching from Cape Flattery south to Cape Shoalwater, including Grays Harbor Bar. Visibility may drop to a quarter nautical mile or less in some locations, making navigation especially hazardous.\nThe advisory covers both nearshore waters within 10 nautical miles and offshore waters extending 60 nautical miles into the Pacific. Areas most affected include routes off James Island, Point Grenville, and the entrance to Grays Harbor, where fishing vessels and cargo traffic are common.\nMariners are urged to use radar, compass navigation, and proper fog signals while underway. The Coast Guard stresses the importance of running lights and reduced speeds in low-visibility conditions to avoid collisions. Those who can postpone trips until later Thursday are advised to do so.\nThe fog is expected to lift gradually by late morning, but forecasters caution that additional advisories could be issued if conditions persist.",
