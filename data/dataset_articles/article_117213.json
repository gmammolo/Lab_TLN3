  "text": "KATHMANDU: Continuous rainfall has completely blocked traffic on nine major roads across Nepal, according to the Department of Roads. In addition, 151 road sections are operating with one-way traffic restrictions.\nOut of the country’s 371 road sections, 211 remain fully open. Department spokesperson Amitkumar Sharma said roads have been damaged by floods, landslides, and inundation, causing disruption in vehicle movement, damage to bridges, and the need for repair work.\nSeveral locations are still under repair due to landslides and flooding. The Trishuli–Mailung–Syabubesi–Rasuwa Gadhi section remains fully blocked following floods from the Himtal area on July 8. In Humla, rising water levels in the Paima River have completely cut off the Karnali Corridor south section.\nThe North–South Koshi Highway is also fully blocked due to rising water and ongoing bridge construction. The Tamor Corridor road from Chatura–Mulghat–Majhitar–Amarapur Danda–Ganeshchok was disrupted after floods destroyed the Bailey bridge on June 20.\nOther fully blocked roads include Tatopani–Timure–Thori–Rasuwa Gadhi, Chhinchu–Marim in West Rukum’s Bheri Corridor, the Rolpa Shahid Highway, Surkhet–Tallo Dugeshwar–Jumla road in Dailekh, and a section of the Araniko Highway in Sindhupalchok.\nSharma added that clearance work is ongoing at landslide-affected sites, and some roads may temporarily close at night due to falling debris, reopening during the day once cleared.",
