  "text": "Tulsa, Okla. – Heavy rain and thunderstorms could bring dangerous flooding across much of northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas through Thursday afternoon, putting communities from Tulsa to Fayetteville on alert.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Tulsa, widespread showers and storms are expected late Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches common. Isolated locations could see 4 to 6 inches, raising the risk of flash flooding in low-lying areas, along rivers, and near creeks.\nCounties under the Flood Watch include Tulsa, Rogers, Mayes, Delaware, Cherokee, Adair, Pawnee, and Wagoner in Oklahoma, as well as Benton, Washington, Madison, and Carroll in Arkansas. The watch also extends west into central Oklahoma, where Stillwater, Perry, and Ponca City could see flooding through Thursday morning.\nEmergency officials urge residents to avoid driving on water-covered roads, keep devices charged in case of power outages, and prepare to move to higher ground if needed.\nThe Flood Watch remains in effect until Thursday afternoon, and additional warnings could be issued as the storms move through.",
