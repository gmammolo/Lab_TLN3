  "text": "Harrison, Ark. – Communities across north central Arkansas could see rising waters through Thursday as a Flood Watch remains in effect for Marion, Boone, Newton, and Searcy counties. Heavy rain and thunderstorms overnight may push creeks and low-lying areas past capacity.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Little Rock, 2 to 4 inches of rain are likely across the Ozark foothills, with locally higher totals possible. The watch extends through Thursday evening, with the greatest risk for flash flooding in steep terrain and along smaller streams.\nEmergency managers warn drivers in Boone and Searcy counties not to attempt travel across flooded roads, where swift water could quickly rise. Low-lying spots in towns such as Jasper, Marshall, and Flippin are especially vulnerable to runoff. Officials urge residents to keep phones charged and prepare to move to higher ground if needed.\nThunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the day Thursday before tapering off by evening. Additional flood advisories may be issued if rainfall totals climb higher than forecast.",
