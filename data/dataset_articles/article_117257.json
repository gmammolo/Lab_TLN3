  "text": "Caribou, Maine – Northern Maine residents will see a shift from sunshine to unsettled weather as showers move in Friday and linger into Saturday. Highs today will climb into the mid-70s under mostly sunny skies, offering one last stretch of warmth before conditions change.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Caribou, a low-pressure system sliding south from western Quebec will bring rain into Aroostook County by Friday morning. The system will track eastward through the day, reaching Bangor and Down East communities by evening. A second low developing along the coast Friday night is expected to spark another round of steady showers that may last into early Saturday.\nRainfall totals could approach an inch across central and northern Maine, though forecasters note uncertainty remains regarding where the heaviest bands will set up. Drivers along I-95 from Houlton south toward Bangor may encounter wet roads and reduced visibility during the Friday evening commute.\nSaturday will stay cool, with highs in the upper 60s and scattered showers, before drier weather returns Sunday. Sunshine and mid-70s are expected to close the weekend, with Labor Day Monday shaping up mostly sunny as well.",
