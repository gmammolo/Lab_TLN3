  "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Heavy rain and potential flash flooding will threaten much of Arkansas late Thursday into Friday morning, with the highest risks in the northwest. Forecasters warn that a band of storms could stall, dropping 3 to 5 inches of rain, and in some spots more than 5 inches in just a six-hour window.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Little Rock, the most likely rainfall totals range from 1 to 3 inches statewide, but northwest Arkansas could see much higher amounts if the heavier axis sets up. The worst-case scenario would bring over 7 inches of rain in localized areas, a level that would almost certainly cause flash flooding.\nRain chances surge across the state Thursday, topping 100% in Fayetteville, Harrison, and Fort Smith, with 90% chances across Little Rock, Hot Springs, and Pine Bluff. Even Jonesboro and West Memphis, on the eastern edge of the storm system, will see a 60% chance of rain through Thursday evening.\nDrivers should avoid flood-prone roads, especially in low-lying areas. Residents are urged to charge phones, clear storm drains, and prepare for the possibility of road closures or power interruptions.\nWidespread showers and storms are expected to continue through Friday morning, with additional advisories likely as rainfall totals climb.",
