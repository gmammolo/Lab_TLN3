  "text": "JACKSON, Miss. – Central Mississippi will see a surge of rain late this week, with several inches expected to fall between Thursday night and Saturday. The National Weather Service in Jackson warns that some communities could receive up to 4 inches, raising the risk of localized flooding and difficult travel.\nAccording to forecasters, most locations across the state can expect 1 to 3 inches of rain, but heavier downpours are likely in central counties including Hinds, Yazoo, and Attala. Jackson and Kosciusko may see some of the highest totals, reaching around 3 inches. Rainfall is also expected across Vicksburg, Brookhaven, Meridian, and Hattiesburg, where amounts of 1.5 to 2 inches are forecast.\nThe timing of the heaviest rain is expected from Thursday evening through Saturday morning. Drivers are urged to use caution on highways such as I-20, I-55, and US-49, where ponding and reduced visibility are likely. Residents in low-lying areas should prepare for potential street flooding and have alternate routes ready.\nRain chances will taper by late Saturday, but forecasters note additional advisories could be issued if rainfall rates increase.",
