  "text": "Dodge City, Kan. – Thunderstorms rolled across central and southwest Kansas early Thursday, bringing small hail, gusty winds, and the potential for localized flooding before gradually shifting east.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Dodge City, storms weakened overnight but remained capable of producing hail and wind gusts near 50 mph. The agency cautioned that saturated ground from recent heavy rainfall could lead to flooding in low-lying areas, especially near creeks and rural roadways.\nBy mid-morning, showers will taper off from west to east, leaving much of Kansas with drier skies. Afternoon highs will climb into the 70s across most of the state, with a few southern counties nearing 80 degrees. Light northeast winds are expected, providing a cooler, less humid feel compared to earlier this week.\nTravelers on I-70 near Hays and I-35 through central Kansas may encounter wet pavement early, but conditions are forecast to improve steadily through the day. Residents are urged to remain alert for any lingering water-covered roads.\nThunderstorms are not expected to redevelop later today, but additional rain chances could return this weekend.",
