  "text": "Hyderabad: Heavy rains continue to batter several parts of Telangana, leading to loss of lives, flooding and large-scale damage to infrastructure. Two persons were swept away along with their car in Neelakatta Vagu at Domakonda, while another died in a wall collapse in Kamareddy district.\nIn a separate incident, Bestha Satyam and Yada Goud from Rajapet village were swept away while crossing Rajapet bridge at Gandari Vagu. Though SDRF teams reached the spot with great difficulty, both remained missing till late evening.\nAt Narmala village in Rajanna-Sircilla district, five people are stranded on a small island. With water overflowing on both sides, evacuation efforts are on. A helicopter deployed from Hakimpet had to return due to rain, and NDRF teams, along with district officials, are attempting to rescue them.\nHeavy inflow into Upper Manair Vagu damaged one side of the bridge at Bandalingampally in Yellareddypet mandal, forcing closure of traffic.\nRainfall has been unprecedented. Argonda station in Rajampet mandal of Kamareddy recorded 44 cm, while 23 other locations registered over 20 cm, including 10 in Kamareddy, four in Nirmal, six in Medak and others in Nizamabad and Siddipet. Officials said this was the heaviest downpour in such a short span in 50 years. Large tracts of farmland are inundated and crop loss is being assessed.\nAbout 15 SDRF and five NDRF teams are on the ground in the rain-hit districts. In addition, 100 Army personnel from the TASA unit in Hyderabad have been deployed for rescue and relief in Medak.\nWidespread damages have been reported from Kamareddy and Medak districts. At Rameshwarpally in Bhiknoor mandal, a railway track caved in, halting train services.\nSeveral colonies, including Housing Board Colony, GR Colony, Teachers Colony and Sarampally ST Residential School in Kamareddy, were submerged. Food and essential supplies are being distributed to residents.\nNational Highway 44 caved in at three locations, disrupting traffic. Heavy vehicles from Hyderabad towards Adilabad are being diverted via Medchal–Siddipet–Karimnagar–Jagtial–Metpally to rejoin NH-44 at Nirmal. Light vehicles from Toopran to Siddipet are also being rerouted. Traffic from Adilabad to Hyderabad is being diverted from Nirmal Kondapally bridge through Khanapur–Jagtial–Karimnagar–Rajiv Rahadari to Hyderabad.\nWater is overflowing on 47 roads, 23 culverts and 15 bridges. Traffic has been blocked at these points with barricades, while joint teams of Police, Revenue and Panchayat Raj departments are monitoring the situation. Tanks have breached at 16 places and alerts have been issued to all affected villages.\nDamages to roads, culverts and bridges have been reported at 85 major locations. At Shamnapur on the Akkanpet–Ramayampet line, a railway track was damaged and services cancelled.\nIn Nizamabad, breach of Hanmajipet Cheruvu led to flooding of Nadimi Thanda, Kunta Thanda and Birappa Thanda in Dharpally mandal. About 200 families were evacuated safely with SDRF assistance.\nChief Minister A Revanth Reddy, along with Deputy Chief Minister Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and Cabinet colleagues, reviewed the ongoing rescue and relief measures and directed officials in affected districts to remain on high alert.",
