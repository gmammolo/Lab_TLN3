  "text": "By Graeme Murray ,\n25 minutes ago Wet and stormy conditions with thunder and lightning are poised to continue in Florida into the next week, impacting Labor Day weekend plans.\nStorms are set to be a feature of the Florida weather over the next few days, with regular downpours during electrical storms.\nBut forecasters say the wet weather is likely to continue past the holiday season and into next week. The scattered storms which are predicted will come with \"comfortable\" temperatures for most.\nStorms to hammer Florida this week Areas such as Jacksonville will experience temperatures in the 70s. But in other areas of Florida the heat gauge is hitting the 80s in places such as Miami and West Palm Beach.\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump makes 'creepy' flirty comment toward Pam Bondi during Cabinet meeting\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump's chilling three-word promise to Putin before Alaska talks exposed by lip reader\nA heat advisory warning will be in place with areas feeling hotter than forecast, But the threat of storms returns next week after a short break.\nAnd thunder and lightning are expected to return in Tuesday next week.\nMeteorologist Steve MacLaughlin of NBC First Alert said the unsettled weather would continue into the holiday period.\n\"As we approach the holiday weekend it looks like some unsettled weather on the way. We are not forecasting any washouts right now, but when it rains it can be quite widespread, starting on Saturday.\n\"Thursday and Friday's rain chances are 50% and they are mainly afternoon focused. As we get to Saturday and beyond rain chances are up to 70% and by the way, we hold that until next Wednesday.\n\"Saturday's rain is likely, but it is mainly afternoon focused so we might have plenty of dry time on Saturday.\n\"The one day where we could have rain at any point is Monday and those afternoon storms tend to be quite widespread.\"\nThunder and lightning to impact Labor Day plans The long-range forecast seems to indicate storms will continue until Thursday next week, bringing a prolonged period of unsettled weather.\nThe conditions have been disruptive in some places with thunderstorms and strong winds affecting large parts of the state.\nThe National Weather Service issued a warning for strong thunderstorms yesterday 50 mph winds forecast for Metro Palm Beach County and Coastal Palm Beach County in Florida.\nLocations affected by the alert included West Palm Beach, Boynton Beach, Lake Worth, Palm Beach, Greenacres, Palm Springs, Lantana, Atlantis, Lake Clarke Shores, Hypoluxo, South Palm Beach, Manalapan, Lake Worth Corridor and Seminole Manor.\nStorm warnings issued The weather agency then said \"These winds can down small tree limbs and branches, and blow around unsecured small objects.\"\nIt also warned people to \"Seek shelter in a safe building until the storm passes.\"",
