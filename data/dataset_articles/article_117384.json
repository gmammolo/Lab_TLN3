  "text": "By Harriette Boucher ,\n15 minutes ago The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain in Wales amid reports of bad weather in the aftermath of Hurricane Erin moving across the Atlantic.\nIt said people should expect some flooding in households, businesses, and on the roads as well as interruption to power supplies and other services.\nThe heavy showers are expected to continue through Thursday morning and early afternoon, feeding in from the Bristol Channel. Met Office has said the conditions will ease up late in the day as the wind direction changes from southwesterly to westerly.\nA yellow weather warning has been issued in Wales as heavy showers are expected until mid-to-late afternoon ((Met Office))\nThe regions affected are Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Swansea.\nThe national meteorological service has reminded people to check if their homes are at risk of flooding, and prepare a food plan and an emergency kit if so.\nIt said: “People cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. It’s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\n“Be prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.”\nIt also remind people to check driving conditions to avoid potential road and traffic delays.\nPeak temperatures over the Bank Holiday Monday (Met Office) The hurricane marks the end of a dry spell for much of the UK after record-breaking temperatures have put the nation on track for the hottest summer on record.\nMonday’s Bank Holiday saw temperatures reach 29.1C in the village of Hawarden in Flintshire and 24.5C in Magilligan, Londonderry, the Met Office said.\nThe previous record for Wales was 26.5C dating back to 1991, and 23.8C for Northern Ireland.\nOn August 16, Hurricane Erin strengthened into a category 5 storm, the most major and catastrophic category, with sustained winds of 160 miles per hour.\nIts intensification was one of the fastest record.\nHurricane Erin on Wednesday 20 Aug (NOAA) As the UK now faces its aftermath, the Met Office has warned that up to 10-20mm of heavy rain and gusts in excess of 50mph are expected in some areas this weekend, particularly along the coasts, and high ground.\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Steve Willington said: “A westerly regime is now in charge of the UK’s weather and will help fuel periods of wet and windy weather over the next few days, with showers and some longer spells of rain likely for much of the UK on Thursday and Friday.\n“While many areas may welcome some rain after fairly prolonged dry weather, there’s a potential that over the next few days some parts of Wales, northwest England and western Scotland could see some impacts at times, which we’ll be keeping an eye on.”\nThis is a breaking story, more to follow...",
