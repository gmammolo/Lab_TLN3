The administration has urged parents to avoid sending children outdoors unnecessarily and to take all necessary precautions to ensure safety during the ongoing rain and waterlogging.\nCopies of the Collector's order have been circulated to the Divisional Commissioner, CEO of the District Council, Deputy Director of the Women and Child Development Department, Chief District Education Officer, subdivision officers, tehsildars, and Civil Defence officials. They have been instructed to comply with the order and remain on alert strictly.\nRajasthan has witnessed an exceptionally heavy monsoon this year, recording 528.60 mm of rainfall so far, which is 53.33 per cent more than the normal average.\nIn view of the situation, Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma has directed large-scale relief and rescue operations in areas affected by flooding.\nSo far, 792 people have been rescued safely across the state, said officials on Thursday.\nOn Thursday, light to moderate rain is likely in several districts, while parts of southern Rajasthan may experience moderate to heavy downpours.\nThe weather department has predicted that rain activity will intensify from August 29 to 30, particularly in Kota and Udaipur divisions, where heavy rain is expected at isolated places. Also, parts of the Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions may witness moderate to heavy rainfall.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
