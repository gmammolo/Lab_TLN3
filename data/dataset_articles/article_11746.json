  "text": "Blackburn MP warns poor transport 'mustn't force people out' after £45bn railway snub Jack Stott Thu 15 January 2026 at 5:00 am UTC 3 min read\nA train at Blackburn station (Image: Northern) The MP for Blackburn has said that his “constituents must never be left with the decision to move out” because of poor transport links, after East Lancashire was snubbed in the Northern Powerhouse Rail project.\nOn Wednesday, December 14, Rachel Reeves announced that the government would be investing £45billion to improve rail services from Liverpool to Newcastle.\nHowever, no projects in East Lancashire were earmarked for improvements, with the announcement focussed on the Liverpool– Manchester –Bradford/Leeds/Sheffield/York corridor.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Adnan Hussain said: “Blackburn and East Lancashire cannot be an afterthought in Northern Powerhouse Rail. The announcement focuses on the Liverpool–Manchester–Bradford/Leeds/Sheffield/York corridor, but communities like ours, where rail services are often slow, overcrowded and unreliable, need a clear share of the investment too.\n“A specific rail investment plan for East Lancashire is needed, with better frequency and reliability, such that it properly connects Blackburn to jobs, skills and opportunity across the North.\n“My constituents must never be left with a decision to move out, because of the lack of job opportunities resulting from poor transport networks.\n“And local business must never have to think of relocation because of transport and logistical issues. I’ll be pressing ministers for a specific East Lancashire package.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The first phase of the programme would involve improved connections on existing lines on these routes: between Sheffield and Leeds; between Leeds and York; and between Leeds and Bradford.\nA second phase of NPR would involve a new route between Liverpool and Manchester via Manchester Airport and Warrington, using a combination of new and existing lines.\nThe third and final phase involves better connections eastwards from Manchester to Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield and York.\nREAD MORE: WATCH: Stunning drone footage shows rare Avanti West Coast service in East Lancs\nREAD MORE: New train service to Stirling with Lancashire stop among most exciting for 2026\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Also within the package, there was no mention of the reintroduction of the Colne-Skipton line, something Pendle and Clitheroe MP Jonathan Hinder has been campaigning for.\nHe said: “I welcome that upgrades to railway services in the North are firmly on the agenda in Westminster.\n“Reducing bottlenecks around Manchester will ultimately mean that more services can run across the North West, including in Lancashire.\n“However, I am still focused on campaigning hard for the Pendle to Leeds line to reopen, and better services from Colne and Clitheroe. I will keep banging the drum for our area to get decent rail services as long as I am an MP.”\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A funding cap of £45billion would be set for NPR, although this could be topped up by local contributions, such as through increased revenue from business rates.\nAn initial £1.1billion for development and design work would be available to enable the creation of a “detailed delivery plan which will include timings”, the Treasury said.\nOn a visit to a rail depot in Leeds, Ms Reeves said: “By the early 2030s I want people to feel the benefits of these investments.\n“I don’t want to have to wait until the whole line is built for anyone to get any benefit.”\n“For me, this isn’t just political, this is personal.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement “Because for a long time, the north of England and my constituents have been let down and been fed false promises.\n“I’m determined that we are now finally going to deliver, and that this Labour Government is going to deliver what previous governments have promised but failed to get over the line, and that is Northern Powerhouse Rail.”\nThe Treasury said it wants a new Birmingham to Manchester rail line, but that it would not be “a reinstatement of HS2”.\nNo timescale was provided on when it would open, but it will not be until after the completion of NPR.\nNPR is the focus of the Government’s wider Northern Growth Strategy, which will be published in the spring and aims to provide better jobs, more homes and increased investment in the region.\nAdvertisement About our ads",
