A Yellow Alert for heavy rainfall is in place on August 28 in Chamba, Lahaul-Spiti, Kangra, Kullu, and Mandi, and on August 29 in Shimla and Mandi. Additionally, an Orange Alert has been issued for August 30-31 in Mandi, Shimla, and Solan.\nI request everyone to avoid unnecessary travel and stay safe... Some areas were evacuated yesterday, and some areas are being evacuated as we speak. All our officers are on the field...\" she said. She added that the situation had worsened after two days of incessant rain. \"NH 3 is damaged at Bindu Dhank.\nThere is waterlogging in the bus stand. In Bahang, near the BRO portion, some restaurants and shops are affected due to water... Mining link roads are also disrupted... Orange alert has been issued...\" she said. Meanwhile, amid heavy rains, the Chandigarh-Manali National Highway has been closed for traffic from Pandoh to Aut in Mandi district for the last three days.\nDue to this, hundreds of cargo vehicles are stranded on the highway, and vegetables and goods are spoiling. The drivers have demanded from the administration that the National Highway be opened as soon as possible. Driver Gurvinder Singh said, \"I have come from Amritsar and am going to Kullu Manali. It has been four days since I arrived.\nThe condition of the road is very bad. The people are taking Rs 260 as toll tax... No one is giving any answer from the administration. The roads are damaged and under construction... It will take 2-3 days.\" Singh added that their vegetables and other goods are spoiling and incurring a loss due to this.\nAnother driver, Bablu Thakur, said, \"We are stuck here for the last few days. It is very difficult to reach home. We are also facing damage at home, and the rivers are in full spate, and the roads are in very bad condition.\" Thakur added that the administration had made no arrangements for food and accommodation. \"Some dhaba people are feeding us sometimes.
