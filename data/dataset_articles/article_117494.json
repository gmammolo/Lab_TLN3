  "text": "Marshall, Minn. – Drivers in southwest Minnesota are navigating dangerous conditions early Thursday as dense fog reduces visibility to less than a quarter mile across the Minnesota River Valley. The National Weather Service reports the fog is moving into the Marshall area and spreading south from Buffalo Ridge.\nAccording to the NWS in Sioux Falls, the low visibility is making travel hazardous along key routes including Highway 75 near Canby and Highway 68 east of Milroy. Conditions are expected to persist through the morning commute, making rural roads and intersections particularly dangerous.\nMotorists are urged to slow down, use low-beam headlights, and allow extra travel time. The fog is expected to gradually lift by late morning, though patchy areas may linger into midday.\nOfficials caution that additional advisories could be issued if the fog persists or redevelops overnight.",
