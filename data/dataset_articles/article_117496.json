  "text": "Miami, Fla. – Thunderstorms will sweep across South Florida Thursday with heavy downpours, gusty winds, and dangerous lightning likely to disrupt the evening commute. The National Weather Service warns some storms could approach severe levels, bringing localized flooding to urban streets and highways.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Miami, storm coverage will increase through the late afternoon and evening. Interior sections from the Everglades eastward into Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties face the highest chance of widespread activity. Areas like Immokalee, Clewiston, and the western suburbs of Miami could see stronger cells capable of producing near-severe wind gusts.\nHazards include flooding on low-lying roads, reduced visibility from intense rainfall, and frequent lightning strikes. Power outages are possible if winds down tree limbs or power lines. Emergency officials advise residents to stay indoors during storms, avoid driving through flooded roadways, and secure outdoor objects that could become projectiles in sudden wind gusts.\nThe threat of scattered storms will linger into tonight, with rain chances remaining high across South Florida before activity tapers toward Friday morning. Additional advisories could be issued if severe development increases.",
