  "text": "Tropical system could threaten Florida Panhandle's Labor Day weekend, says AccuWeather\nBrandon Girod\n- Florida will see a wet and stormy Labor Day weekend.\n- AccuWeather forecasters say there is a low chance of a tropical system developing near the southeastern U.S.\n- Panhandle temperatures will dip into the mid-80s and low-70s over the three-day weekend.\nFlorida’s Labor Day weekend weather forecast looks wet, stormy and a bit cool –especially in the Panhandle.\nWhile things quiet down in the Atlantic basin, AccuWeather forecasters warn of the potential for “homegrown” tropical development near the southeastern United States over the three-day weekend.\n“We expect an unusually strong dip in the jet stream to push into the Southeast states over the holiday weekend, which could help spin up homegrown tropical development,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\nThe National Hurricane Center isn’t currently tracking any tropical disturbances with the potential for development.\nAccuWeather forecasters say the chance of a tropical depression forming is low, but Floridians should expect the weather pattern to bring showers, thunderstorms and downpours heavy enough to trigger flash flooding in some urban areas regardless of development.\n\"It is somewhat rare to see the risk of homegrown tropical development in late August,\" DaSilva said. \"We typically see homegrown tropical development near the U.S. coast during early weeks and the final weeks of the hurricane season.”\nHere’s a look at the Labor Day weekend weather forecast in the Florida Panhandle\nLow chance of a tropical system springing up over Labor Day weekend\nAccuWeather forecasters are monitoring an area in the Gulf that has a low chance of spawning a tropical system over Labor Day weekend thanks to an “unusually strong” dip in the jet stream expected to push into the southeast.\nThe chances of a tropical system developing from the weather pattern are low, but showers and thunderstorms are a given. “The pattern will bring showers, thunderstorms and torrential downpours that can set off flash urban flooding,” AccuWeather wrote.\nFlorida, southern Alabama and Georgia are expected to have the most direct impact.\nThe Pensacola area will start to see thunderstorms on Friday. Storm activity is expected to peak during the day on Saturday before tapering off a bit on Sunday and Labor Day, according to the latest National Weather Service forecast.\nThe rest of the Panhandle, from Fort Walton Beach and Destin to Panama City, is expected to see similar chances of storms over the weekend.\nTemperatures will dip into the mid-80s and low-70s over the weekend\nOvernight temperatures reminiscent of fall have already struck the Florida Panhandle, but highs are expected to dip further over the weekend.\nThe Pensacola area will see temperatures dip to around 85 degrees between Saturday and Labor Day, with lows hovering in the low 70s.\nThose temperatures will spread out over the rest of the Florida Panhandle, with Destin and Panama City experiencing similar drops.\nPensacola area Labor Day weekend forecast\n- Friday, Aug. 29: The weekend will start partly sunny with a high near 87 degrees. The chance for showers and thunderstorms is 40%, mainly after 1 p.m..\n- Saturday, Aug. 30: Rain chances increase to 80% on Saturday, with showers and thunderstorms likely throughout the day. The high temperature is expected to be around 85 degrees.\n- Sunday, Aug. 31: A 50% chance of showers and thunderstorms continues into Sunday, with a high near 86 degrees.\n- Monday, Sept. 1 (Labor Day): The holiday itself will see a 40% chance of showers and thunderstorms with a high near 85 degrees.",
