  "text": "Summer of 2025 is the fourth-hottest in the Netherlands on record\nThe summer of 2025 ranked as the fourth-warmest measured since record-keeping began in 1901 in the Netherlands, with two official heat waves, a rare very hot day above 35 degrees, and severe drought, according to weeronline.\nThe average temperature in De Bilt reached 18.5 degrees, compared with the normal 17.6. Only the summers of 2018 (18.9), 2003 (18.7), and 2022 (18.6) were hotter.\nThe season brought 79 warm days above 20 degrees, 29 summer days above 25 degrees, and eight tropical days above 30 degrees.\nOn July 1, Eindhoven reached 37.6 degrees, while Maastricht rose to 39.0 degrees on July 2 — the fifth-highest temperature ever recorded in the country.\nTwo official heat waves were registered, from June 28 to July 2 and from August 11 to 15. Eindhoven recorded the longest, lasting nine days. Since 1901, only five summers have produced two official heat waves.\nRainfall averaged 174 millimeters nationwide, far below the normal 235, leaving a precipitation deficit of 270 millimeters by late August. The dry spell was most pronounced in August, with only 38 millimeters of rain.\nThe sun shone 750 hours this summer, against the seasonal average of 657, placing 2025 among the ten sunniest summers on record.\nDespite the heat, August also brought an anomaly: ground frost on August 24 and 25 in Volkel and Eindhoven. It was the earliest frost recorded after midsummer since 1973",
