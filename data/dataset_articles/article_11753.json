  "text": "I n a move that surprised many boxing fans, Ryan Garcia recently revealed why he turned down a massive payout from Jake Paul , reportedly between $20 million and $25 million, to pursue a far more meaningful goal: a shot at a world title.\nRather than taking the easy money, Garcia has committed himself to a February 21 fight against Mario Barrios for the WBC welterweight championship, a bout his promoter Oscar De La Hoya confirmed will take place in Las Vegas.\n$25 million couldn't tempt Ryan Garcia: Why he picked a title fight over Jake Paul Jake Paul humiliates Floyd Mayweather with a visual knockout by comparing private jets in the hangar This fight marks a critical comeback after a series of setbacks in Garcia 's career.\nGarcia 's decision comes after a challenging period in his professional life. Following hand surgery and a loss to Rolando Romero , the 27-year-old boxer had to take time away from the ring, leaving his fans uncertain about his next steps.\nAmid this uncertainty, the opportunity to fight Barrios for a recognized world title emerged, forcing Garcia to weigh financial gain against his long-term career goals. The lure of the championship belt proved stronger than the short-term security of a high-profile crossover fight with Paul .\nMany in the boxing community were aware that negotiations had taken place for a Garcia-Paul matchup after Paul 's initially planned exhibition with Gervonta Davis was canceled due to legal issues surrounding Davis .\nAccording to Garcia, Paul's offer was significant, potentially life-changing, but ultimately, it would not advance his ultimate goal: cementing his legacy as a world champion.\nIn a recent livestream with influencers Sara Saffari and Bradley Martyn, Garcia addressed the subject directly, admitting he had been tempted but ultimately decided to prioritize the title shot over the payday.\nGarcia's decision explained Garcia described the potential Paul fight as \"easy money,\" yet he admitted that his heart was set on competing for a recognized title rather than stepping into a bout that, while lucrative, could have derailed his long-term ambitions.\nThis decision reflects a shift from purely commercial considerations toward prioritizing his legacy, showing that Garcia values the challenges of elite competition more than immediate financial reward.\nDespite controversy and setbacks, from injuries to a suspension after a positive drug test, Garcia remains one of boxing's most marketable figures.\nHis popularity likely fueled Paul 's interest, as the YouTuber-turned-fighter has sought high-profile opponents to elevate his boxing profile.\nGarcia 's choice highlights a dedication to the sport itself rather than simply chasing viral moments or easy paydays.\nAs Garcia prepares for his clash with Barrios , questions remain about his readiness and the risks of this title fight. A victory would crown him a first-time world champion and reshape the narrative around his career trajectory.\nOne thing is clear: for Garcia , money alone was never enough to outweigh the chance to achieve greatness in the ring.",
