  "text": "Residents of Arizona are experiencing a humungous dust storm rolling through the state, engulfing areas like Phoenix in a massive cloud that brings with it heavy rain alongside thunder and lightning.\nWeather can often be one of the most dangerous things to encounter in its extreme forms, with scientists predicting that hazardous forms will hit around 70% of the human population across the next 20 years as a consequence of climate change.\nMany people are already used to the extreme temperature swings that have came as a result of this, including the perils of deathly hot summers that come with their own health risks, yet one major storm has taken over the state of Arizona this week in an unexpected way.\nAs reported by ABC15 Arizona, weather stations started to take notice of concerning weather patterns in southern Arizona on Tuesday (August 26) morning, with experts indicating that heavy rainfall and flash floods were possible, but little did they know what was on the horizon.\nAdvert\nAt around 4 pm it became clear that dust storms weren't just a possibility but something that many residents across the state would imminently have to deal with, and warnings were sent out for people to stay clear and safe, particularly when driving on roads.\nAdvert\nThe state's Department of Transportation issued an immediate warning on X, writing: \"There's currently reduced visibility on I-10 near Picacho Peak due to a dust storm. Do NOT drive into it.\n\"You should NEVER drive into a dust storm, but if you encounter one and don't have time to exit, remember to Pull Aside, Stay Alive!\"\nAs per the BBC, dust storms of this size are typically a phenomenon known as a 'haboob', which comes from Arabic, meaning 'strong wind' or 'gale'. These aren't uncommon across the southern states, although this particular tidal wave of dust is frightening in its sheer size.\nAdvert\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also issued a ground stop for flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, with the storm eventually damaging parts of the airport's fourth terminal roof, causing an evacuation.\nResidents across the state have also reported power outages, and there has been damage to houses and business around the Valley which has caused significant concern.\n\"I was with my wife and daughter at the railroad park in Scottsdale and it hit us while we were on the train ride,\" writes one resident on the r/Arizona subreddit. \"They wouldn't stop the ride so we just had to sit in it for like 5 minutes, got absolutely caked in dirt. Think I've still got some dust in my ears, lol.\"\nAnother remarked that they were \"stuck in the middle of that and the amount of people blowing past me (while I was parked) on the highway was disturbing.\"",
