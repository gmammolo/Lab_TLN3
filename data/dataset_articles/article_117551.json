  "text": "Port Huron, Mich. – Dangerous waves and rip currents are building across southern Lake Huron this afternoon, creating hazardous conditions for both swimmers and boaters. The National Weather Service issued a Small Craft Advisory and Beach Hazards Statement in effect until 10 a.m. Friday.\nAccording to the NWS Detroit/Pontiac office, strong north winds behind a passing cold front are producing waves of 5 to 7 feet, with occasional peaks near 9 feet. Gusts up to 30 knots will make conditions especially dangerous for smaller vessels.\nThe Beach Hazards Statement covers Huron, Sanilac, and St. Clair counties, where rip currents and strong surf may quickly pull swimmers into deeper water. Officials advise staying out of the lake and away from piers and jetties during the advisory period.\nFor boaters, conditions from Outer Saginaw Bay to Port Huron will remain hazardous until early Friday. Authorities recommend delaying trips until winds and waves subside.\nHazards are expected to ease Friday as winds diminish, but another round of updates may follow if conditions linger.\nFive Day Forecast for Port Huron, Mich.:\n- Thursday: Windy, waves 5–9 feet on Lake Huron, highs near 72°F.\n- Friday: Breezy, cooler with highs in the upper 60s, waves subsiding by midday.\n- Saturday: Mostly sunny, highs near 75°F.\n- Sunday: Partly cloudy, highs around 78°F.\n- Monday: Scattered showers possible, highs in the mid-70s.",
