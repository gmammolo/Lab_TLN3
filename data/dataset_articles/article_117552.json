  "text": "Detroit, Mich. – Rain will slow the morning commute across metro Detroit today, with thunderstorms possible into the evening before a stretch of clear, sunny weather takes over for the holiday weekend.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Detroit/Pontiac, scattered showers will persist until around 11 a.m., followed by an increasing chance of thunderstorms after 5 p.m. Highs will reach the low 70s, but gusty southwest winds could make travel tricky in open areas. The strongest storms may produce brief downpours and reduced visibility.\nTonight, isolated storms could linger until 2 a.m. before skies gradually clear. Temperatures will drop to near 50 degrees, with winds turning north and easing overnight. Friday begins a stable pattern, bringing mostly sunny skies and highs near 69, followed by a warmup through the weekend.\nDrivers are urged to slow down on wet roads today, especially along I-94 and I-75, where ponding could develop during heavier rainfall. Outdoor plans for Labor Day weekend, however, look favorable with highs climbing into the upper 70s by Sunday.\nSunny conditions are expected to hold through early next week, with only a slight chance of showers returning by midweek.\nFive Day Forecast for Detroit, MI\n- Friday: Mostly sunny, high near 69, low 50\n- Saturday: Sunny, high near 73, low 53\n- Sunday: Sunny, high near 76, low 55\n- Labor Day (Monday): Sunny, high near 78, low 50\n- Tuesday: Partly cloudy, high near 79, low 61",
