  "text": "Tulsa, Oklahoma – Residents across eastern Oklahoma are bracing for a messy Thursday as widespread thunderstorms and heavy rain bring a high risk of flash flooding and minor severe weather threats across the region.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Tulsa, a Flood Watch remains in effect through 1 p.m. for northeastern Oklahoma and parts of northwest Arkansas. Forecasters expect 1 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated totals up to 6 inches, particularly in far northeast counties like Ottawa and Delaware. Training thunderstorms are expected to repeatedly pass over the same areas, increasing the potential for rapid flooding.\nTulsa, Bartlesville, and Fayetteville sit squarely within the high-risk flood zone, with 60–70% chances of storms through most of the day. Areas farther south—including Muskogee and McAlester—could see a stronger round of storms by this afternoon, with wind gusts up to 60 mph and quarter-sized hail possible. The tornado threat remains low, but not zero, especially in southeastern Oklahoma.\nDrivers should avoid flooded roads and prepare for rapidly changing conditions, especially along low-lying creeks, streams, and rivers. Officials urge residents to have multiple ways to receive alerts and seek higher ground immediately if a warning is issued.\nAdditional warnings remain possible through tonight as storms persist into the evening hours.",
