  "text": "Newport, N.C. – Storm chances are set to increase across coastal North Carolina as Labor Day weekend approaches, with scattered thunderstorms possible from Saturday afternoon through Tuesday. While dry weather dominates today and Friday, unsettled skies could disrupt holiday plans beginning this weekend.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Newport can expect highs in the low to mid-80s with humid conditions persisting. A slight chance of storms arrives Saturday after 2 p.m., growing to a 30% chance by Sunday afternoon. Thunderstorms are expected to remain possible each day through Tuesday, particularly during the late afternoon and evening hours.\nLocally heavy rain and brief gusty winds could impact outdoor events, especially along U.S. Highway 70 and nearby beach towns.
