  "text": "Heavy rains have damaged NH-44 in Kamareddy, stranding hundreds of vehicles. Police have announced diversion routes for heavy and light traffic.\nHyderabad: Following unprecedented heavy rain in Kamareddy and adjoining districts, and the resulting damage to National Highway 44 (Nagpur Highway), authorities have announced diversions for traffic moving from Hyderabad towards Adilabad.\nCyberabad Police said diversions have been implemented to ensure public safety and maintain smooth vehicular flow.\nHeavy vehicles travelling from Hyderabad to Adilabad via NH-44 will be diverted at Medchal Checkpost towards Siddipet via the Karimnagar Highway. The route will pass through Siddipet, Karimnagar, Jagityal, Korutla, Metpally, Armoor and then onwards to Adilabad.\nLight vehicles will be diverted from Toopran towards Siddipet via the Karimnagar Highway. These vehicles will pass through Medchal, Toopran, Siddipet, Karimnagar, Jagityal, Korutla, Metpally, Armoor and Adilabad.\nPolice have appealed to commuters to plan their journeys accordingly and cooperate with officers at diversion points. Heavy vehicles and long-distance travellers have been urged to strictly follow the designated diversion routes to prevent congestion.\nCyberabad Joint Commissioner of Police Gajarao Bhupal said Traffic Police and Highway Patrol teams are stationed along the routes to assist motorists.\nHundreds of vehicles were stranded on NH-44 from Wednesday as heavy rain and flooding damaged the highway stretch between Kamareddy, Dichpally and Armoor.\nMeanwhile, Nirmal Police have also announced diversions for vehicles travelling from Adilabad towards Hyderabad. Traffic will be diverted near Kondapur bridge at Nirmal and rerouted through Mamada, Khanapur, Metpally, Jagtial and Karimnagar before reaching Hyderabad.\nNirmal District Superintendent of Police G Janaki Sharmila requested commuters to cooperate with the revised arrangements.\nPanchayat Raj Minister Danasari Seethakka chaired a teleconference on the flood situation in Kamareddy district. She directed officials to carry out on-site inspections in affected areas and immediately shift residents of inundated houses to relief centres.\nThe minister also instructed officials to drain water from submerged homes, assess damages across departments, and submit reports promptly. She further called for fast-tracking sanitation measures to prevent the spread of disease and urged officials to ensure no loss of life.\nMinister Seethakka said she would personally review the situation once weather conditions improve.\nIANS\nRelated Topics\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.
