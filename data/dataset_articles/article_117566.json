  "text": "TAMPA, Fla. – Thunderstorms are expected to ramp up across interior and southwest Florida Thursday afternoon, bringing the potential for heavy downpours, lightning, and dangerous heat across the region.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Tampa Bay, scattered showers will develop by midday, becoming more numerous inland through the evening. Coastal areas will see highs around 90 degrees, while inland cities climb into the middle 90s. With oppressive humidity, heat index values could reach between 100 and 105 degrees, creating a dual threat of heat stress and sudden storms.\nLight winds shifting from the west-southwest at 5 to 10 mph may allow sea breezes to trigger additional thunderstorms, especially along the I-75 corridor. Commuters in Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Lakeland should prepare for reduced visibility, slick roads, and possible delays during the evening rush.\nResidents are urged to limit outdoor activity during peak heat hours, stay hydrated, and avoid flooded streets when storms develop. More rounds of storms remain possible through the weekend, keeping rain chances elevated.",
