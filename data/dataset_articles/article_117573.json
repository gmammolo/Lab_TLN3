  "text": "Ziraat Times News Desk Srinagar: The United Kingdom government has revised its travel advisory for Jammu & Kashmir, adding flash floods and landslides to the list of risks for UK nationals to the Himalayan region. The update, issued by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) in New Delhi on Thursday, comes amid heightened extreme weather events in recent weeks. The FCDO said it continues to advise against all travel to the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, including Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Srinagar city, and the Jammu–Srinagar highway. The only exceptions permitted under the advisory are: Travel by air to and from Jammu city and travel within Jammu city limits. FCDO has also cautioned UK nationals that their travel insurance could be invalidated if they travel against the advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).",
