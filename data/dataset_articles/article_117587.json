  "text": "CHICO, Calif. - The Langdon Engineering Center at Chico State University has been closed indefinitely due to water damage, just three days into the fall semester.\nCrews arrived at 5 a.m. Wednesday to address what Chico State described as \"significant water intrusion\" inside the building.\n\"This is a really unfortunate disruption to what was otherwise a really exciting time for us. It's the third day of the fall semester. We've got students everywhere and we're just working to make sure this doesn't impact the great experience we know that they're going to have,\" said Ashley Gebb.\nThe water damage occurred during roof repairs, as an unexpected rainstorm hit the area, causing significant damage to much of the building.\n\"It is not standard for Chico to get a rainstorm of that caliber this time of year. I think it took all of us by surprise and because it came as late as it did last night we weren't prepared,\" Gebb said.\nThe Langdon Engineering Center hosts several programs, crucial for students like Elian Ramirez, a computer science major.\n\"Most of my classes are in Langdon, machine learning as well as software engineering. So it kind of impedes my progress because it's barely the first week of school really, so really does put a big drag on what I'm trying to learn,\" said Ramirez.\nOnce the clean-up is complete, the damage will be assessed to determine which parts of the building can be used soon.\n\"We hope this is going to be a very brief disruption. We have crews in her right now and crews working to assess the damage and remediate the damage so that we can open as many classrooms as we can as soon as we can, maybe even as early as tomorrow,\" Gebb said.\nFaculty has the option to hold classes on Zoom, and students are encouraged to check their email for updates on class status.",
