  "text": "MANASQUAN — Hurricane Erin soaked parts of the Jersey Shore and submerged roads in Manasquan as aggressive and chaotic waves peaked during a late high tide around 7:30 p.m. last Thursday evening.\nThe storm presented an opportunity for officials to assess the flooding sustained and calculate how a recently presented plan might help mitigate moderate coastal flooding in Manasquan in the future.\nHurricane Erin, the first registered storm of hurricane season, moderately flooded areas in town that have been vulnerable to flooding for generations. The effects of the storm inundated popular beach access roads like East Main Street and Brielle Road, while submerging residential neighborhood roads near the Glimmer Glass and the beachfront.\nMayor Michael Mangan told The Coast Star, “Everything went more or less as expected, which is a good thing when you’re talking about storms. We saw moderate coastal flooding that we expected. We saw the streets covered and we did not see any damage to properties that I’m aware of right now, so that’s good.”\nThe effects of Hurricane Erin were felt just weeks after the council introduced a plan that aims to stem frequent and moderate coastal flooding in town, offering the borough’s Office of Emergency Management team the ability to understand how planned road elevation and flood mitigation projects could better combat flooding in Manasquan.\n“The flooding event Thursday night is right on the edge of what our plans would be able to address… If we had an event like we had, there would still be water covering roads, but they would still be passable” Mangan said.\nThe mayor said he traveled throughout the streets of the borough last Thursday, alongside the Manasquan Office of Emergency Management team, and assessed how the recently introduced plan to address low level flooding would have deterred the effects of Hurricane Erin.\nThe “Community Mapping Plan” uses several statistics-driven maps to identify areas of Manasquan in need of improvements focused on increasing drainage, raising road elevations and installing tide valves, in addition to other measures.\nResidents and weekenders looking to ring in the summer season on Aug. 21 were quickly met with moderate coastal flooding on streets throughout Manasquan.\nOn the beachfront, aggressive ocean conditions covered the majority of Manasquan’s beaches that typically invite beachgoers to lounge and enjoy the summer. High winds and strong tides brought water as far up the beach as the oceanfront beach walk during the peak high tide.\nRiverside Drive flooded after tidal waters from the Manasquan Inlet elevated over the guard rail and floodwall.\nThe East Main Street area saw roads entirely submerged and gated off by the Manasquan Police Department, with some residents deploying kayaks to traverse flooded areas.\n“This storm can give people a good vision about what we want to do with our road elevation and flood valve program that would be designed to handle just shy of what we saw in town with Hurricane Erin. That’s the idea of our flood mitigation program if we can get funding for it,” Mayor Mangan said.\nThe mapping plan, which was presented and organized by borough engineer Joe Raftery alongside Office of Emergency Management Coordinator Chris Tucker, presents a detailed plan for how Manasquan can tackle frequent coastal flooding in an effort to secure county, state and federal grants to fund the mitigation projects.\nThe projects highlighted in the plan focus on proactive methods the borough can take to protect against future flooding events. The office of emergency management evaluated the entire borough, searching for realistic projects Manasquan can undertake to combat frequent flooding.\nAccording to Mayor Mangan, the Community Mapping plan is not in place to combat catastrophic weather events like Superstorm Sandy, but rather the moon-tide, minimal rainfall flooding and moderate flooding from storms like Hurricane Erin that have plagued the coastal water areas of Manasquan for years.\nHurricane Erin’s high-tide rush that turned some low-level streets in Manasquan into swimming pools is the extent of the flooding that the community mapping plan will combat, Mayor Mangan said. While Hurricane Erin did not make landfall in New Jersey and passed the Jersey Shore on Aug. 21 as a category 2 storm, the fallout that soaked Manasquan is as much as the borough’s mitigation plan is prepared to handle.\nAccording to Mayor Mangan, Manasquan has procedures and plans for every level of flood and category of storm that the borough might see, focused on ensuring the safety of residents in town.\nDepending on the severity of the storm, different forecasts call for different procedures, Mayor Mangan said. In the case of a severe event, evacuations may be required as an extreme response, such as during Superstorm Sandy, when an extreme storm surge destroyed houses and infrastructure throughout Manasquan and across the Jersey Shore.\n“As far as planning for storms bigger than what we experienced from Erin, we will need help from the state or federal government. Whether it’s a floodgate at the inlet or another public works, Army Corps of Engineers solution. Manasquan doesn’t have the capability to mitigate or protect against storms much larger than the one we just experienced,” Mangan said.\nPart of the Community Mapping flood mitigation plan was identifying larger projects like the floodgate mentioned by Mayor Mangan, an estimated $150,000,000 federal project. That colossal project is one of several highlighted in the mitigation plan that focused on identifying large-scale solutions to one of Manasquan’s most realistic threats.\n“We were lucky with this one. What we said was we dodged a bullet and I’m glad it wasn’t worse. Had this storm come a couple hundred miles closer, we would have had a serious situation on our hands,” Mangan said.\nThis is an excerpt of the print article.
