  "text": "R Madhavan took to Instagram on Wednesday to share that he has been stuck in Leh as flights were cancelled due to heavy rain. In the video which he shared, the actor also recalled of a similar incident that happened during the shoot of 3 Idiots (2009).\nIn the video, Madhavan showed the view outside his hotel room with snow covered mountain peaks and cloudy skies. He said, “End of August, and we already got snow in the mountaintops at Ladakh. I'm stuck in Leh because the airports have been shut down because of incessant rain in the last four days. Somehow, every time I come to shoot in Ladakh, that's what happens.”\nHe added, “I came here last in 2008 for the 3 Idiots shoot at Pangong Lake, and we had to wait because it snowed all of a sudden in August, and now this. But still breathtakingly beautiful. I hope the sky clears up today and the planes are able to land and I can get back home.”\nThe climax of Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots was shot at Ladakh's scenic Pangong Lake.\nSharing the video, Madhavan wrote, “Stuck in Leh again. No flights. Rain after 17 years.” The airport at Leh was closed due to adverse weather conditions on Wednesday with the authorities issuing advisory for passengers.\nOn the work front, Madhavan was last seen in the romantic-drama, Aap Jaisa Koi, which was released on Netflix and also starred Fatima Sana Shaikh in the lead. He also played a pivotal role in Akshay Kumar's historical-drama, Kesari Chapter 2, which was released in theatres earlier this year.\nHe will be seen next in the spy-thriller, Dhurandhar which also stars Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, and Arjun Rampal in the lead. Directed by Aditya Dhar, the film is set to be released in theatres on December 5.",
