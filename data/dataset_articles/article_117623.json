  "text": "Houston, Texas – Residents across Houston will see scattered thunderstorms return late this week as high humidity and heat indices push conditions into dangerous territory. Afternoon highs in the low- to mid-90s combined with dew points in the 70s will send heat indices soaring past 100 through Sunday, with storm chances peaking over the weekend.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Houston, Friday brings a 30% chance of showers and storms after midday, with the likelihood of heavier rain increasing to 50–60% Saturday afternoon into Sunday evening. South and southwest winds will hold around 5 to 10 mph, keeping Gulf moisture streaming inland.\nTravelers and outdoor workers should prepare for sudden downpours and lightning delays on major roadways such as I-45, US-59, and Beltway 8. Heat stress remains a major concern, especially for those without shade or access to air conditioning. The NWS urges residents to limit outdoor activity in the afternoon, stay hydrated, and check on vulnerable neighbors.\nStorms taper somewhat by Labor Day, but rain chances linger into early next week before conditions begin to dry out by midweek.\nFive Day Forecast for Houston, Texas\n- Friday: High near 95, storms possible after noon.\n- Saturday: High near 93, storms likely after 1 p.m.\n- Sunday: High near 87, widespread storms in afternoon.\n- Labor Day: High near 89, storms possible.\n- Tuesday: High near 93, sunny and drier.",
