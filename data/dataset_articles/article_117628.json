  "text": "CHICAGO, Ill. – Swimmers and boaters along Lake Michigan are being warned of life-threatening conditions through Friday as strong currents and waves up to 7 feet pound the shoreline. The National Weather Service said thunderstorms and dangerous rip currents could make Chicago beaches especially hazardous late Thursday into Friday.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Chicago, a Beach Hazards Statement remains in effect for Cook County and nearby areas until late Friday afternoon. Large waves, rip currents, and shifting winds will create treacherous swimming conditions, especially for inexperienced swimmers. Officials warn residents to stay out of the water and off piers, jetties, and breakwalls.\nChicago’s Office of Emergency Management noted that swim bans may be in place at multiple beaches. Local officials urged residents to check [cpdbeaches.com] before heading out. Drivers near the lakefront could also encounter slick conditions during passing thunderstorms Thursday.\nThe greatest risks stretch from northern Illinois into northwest Indiana, with the most dangerous wave action expected Thursday afternoon through Friday. Spotter activation is not expected for storms, but the agency cautions conditions could shift quickly.\nHazards remain in place until at least Friday afternoon, with calmer weather and sunnier skies expected for the holiday weekend.\nFive Day Forecast for Chicago, IL\n- Thursday: Showers and thunderstorms likely, high near 72. Risk of rip currents and waves 4–7 ft.\n- Friday: Mostly sunny, high 67. Lake conditions remain hazardous until evening.\n- Saturday: Mostly sunny, high near 72. Calmer on Lake Michigan.\n- Sunday: Sunny, high 74, lows in the 60s.\n- Monday (Labor Day): Warm, mostly clear skies with highs near 82.",
