  "text": "\" Switzerland is facing heavy rains from Wednesday evening\n\" Switzerland is facing heavy rains from Wednesday evening\nHumid air from the Mediterranean will hit the Alps. An area of low pressure is forming over Spain, which will bring a large amount of moisture to the northeast. \"When this air rises over the Alps, the moisture condenses and intense rains begin,\" explains Vic.\nThunderstorms are added to this, which further increase precipitation. Combined with the cyclone's trajectory, this leads to particularly large amounts of rain expected in northern Ticino, southern Grisons and surrounding areas.\nThe highest level of danger has been declared (5)\nThe most affected will be the Maggia Valley and its branches (Val di Peccia, Val Lavizzara), the Blenio valley, the northern part of Leventina, as well as Bedrettal.\nIn southern Grisons, the main precipitation will fall in Mizoks and possibly in Kalankatar. Heavy rains are also expected in Bergell and Upper Engadine.\nPrecipitation will be slightly weaker, but still stormy, in the Gotthard area, in the western part of the southern Grisons, as well as in some parts of the central and northern Grisons.",
