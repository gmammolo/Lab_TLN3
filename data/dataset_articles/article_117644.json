  "text": "By Harriette Boucher ,\n13 minutes ago The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for rain across Wales, anticipating heavy showers in the aftermath of Hurricane Erin. Expected impacts include flooding in households, businesses, and on roads, as well as potential interruptions to power supplies and other services. The warning affects regions such as Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Powys, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Swansea, with conditions expected to ease late on Thursday. The Met Office advises residents to prepare for power cuts, check for flood risks, and stay updated on weather forecasts and driving conditions. This period of wet weather follows Hurricane Erin strengthening to a Category 5 storm and marks the end of a prolonged dry spell for much of the UK.
