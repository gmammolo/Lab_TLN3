  "text": "Economist Peter Schiff questioned the sustainability of Bitcoin’s ongoing rally on Wednesday, arguing that investors are mistakenly rotating profits from commodities into cryptocurrency-linked assets.\nSchiff Downplays Bitcoin Rally Schiff suggested in an X post that traders are taking profits in gold and silver mining stocks and buying Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and Strategy .\n“That's a big mistake,” the Bitcoin skeptic stated, urging them instead to cash out of Bitcoin and MSTR and use the proceeds to buy precious metal-linked stocks.\nSchiff made a similar call earlier this month, arguing that Bitcoin’s uptick isn’t a bullish sign but just a “pumper” narrative .",
