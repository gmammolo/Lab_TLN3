  "text": "Wednesday’s depression over west-central and adjoining north-west Bay of Bengal (off Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coasts) beat forecasts to intensify as a deep depression over the same region this (Thursday) morning at 190 km south-southeast of Gopalpur; 90 km east-southeast of Kalingapatnam; and 250 km east of Visakhapatnam (all Andhra Pradesh); and 230 km south of Puri; and 310 km south-southwest of Paradip (both Odisha). Crossing\nMay cross coast tonight\nIndia Meteorological Department (IMD) said it is likely to continue to move north-northwestwards and cross Odisha and adjoining Andhra Pradesh coasts between Gopalpur and Paradip by tonight (Thursday). The deep depression, numbered as Tropical Storm One by the US Joint Typhoon Warning Centre, appeared to have taken advantage of warm seas to intensify rapidly through Wednesday last night.\nJTWC assigns number\nNumbering of a storm is the penultimate step of assigning a name to a system - a tropical storm or deep depression - to classify it as a cyclone. The monsoon transition period from south-west (June-September) to north-east (October-December) is fraught with possibility of cyclone genesis provided upper air environment also becomes favourable. The IMD dos not foresee any change in status ahead of landfall of the system.\nDevours on moisture\nThrough Wednesday night, the depression devoured on warmth of the Bay waters (29-30℃) and available moisture to intensify ahead of forecasts and hasten landfall by tonight itself. To the other side of the peninsula, a twin but increasingly inconsequential depression over north-east Arabian Sea moved south-southwestwards into the high seas and away from the Gujarat coast, located in the morning at 200 km south-west of Dwarka; 270 km south-southwest of Naliya; 200 km west-southwest of Porbandar; and 440 km south of Karachi.\nThe IMD has issued rain warnings for the landscape mainly towards of the east of the country as follows:\n- Andhra Pradesh: Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very rainfall at isolated places over coastal Andhra Pradesh today (Thursday).\n- Odisha: Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy (≥ 20 cm) rainfall on Thursday and isolated heavy to very heavy on Friday.\n- West Bengal: Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very rainfall at isolated places on both Thursday and Friday. Thereafter, rainfall would reduce to being heavy at isolated places on Saturday.\n- Hills of West Bengal: Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is likely on Friday and Saturday, with heavy rainfall at isolated places on Thursday.\n- Jharkhand: Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy rainfall at isolated places on Thursday. Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday; heavy rainfall at isolated places on Saturday.\n- Chhattisgarh: Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places is likely on Friday and heavy rainfall at isolated places on Saturday.\n- Bihar: Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy rainfall at isolated places on Thursday and heavy to very heavy at isolated places for three days from Friday.\n- East Uttar Pradesh: Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday and heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on Saturday and Sunday.\n- East Madhya Pradesh: Light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy rainfall at isolated places Friday and Saturday.\nPublished on October 2, 2025",
