  "text": "SALISBURY — Hood Theological Seminary recently announced the 2025 Ruben L. Speaks Endowed Memorial Lecture Series, which will take place Oct. 3-4, on the Seminary’s campus in Salisbury.\nAccording to a release from the seminary, this annual lecture series, established in honor of the late bishop, “continues to celebrate his legacy of theological insight, social witness and faithful leadership within the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and beyond.”\nThis year’s distinguished lecturer is Corey D. B. Walker, Ph.D., who according to the release, is a “renowned scholar, theologian and public intellectual whose work engages the intersections of religion, democracy and African American thought.”\nWalker currently serves as dean of Wake Forest University School of Divinity, Wake Forest Professor of the Humanities, and inaugural director of the Program in African American Studies where he brings visionary leadership and a deep commitment to the transformative power of education, ethical engagement and critical scholarship.\n“We are delighted to welcome Dr. Walker as this year’s Ruben L. Speaks Lecturer,” said Dr. Vergel L. Lattimore III, president of Hood Theological Seminary. “His voice continues the tradition of Bishop Speaks, who embodied a deep commitment to faith, justice and the pursuit of knowledge. This lecture series reminds us of the seminary’s role in fostering rigorous theological reflection and faithful leadership for the church and the world.”\nThe release described the Ruben L. Speaks Lecture Series as a “signature academic event at Hood Theological Seminary,” adding that “Each year, the seminary hosts leading scholars and theologians whose work inspires students, clergy, and the wider community. In honoring Bishop Speaks, who was both a visionary church leader and a respected seminary instructor, the series uplifts the importance of linking faith and intellect in the ongoing work of ministry.”",
