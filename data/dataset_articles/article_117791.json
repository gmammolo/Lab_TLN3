  "text": "MANILA, Philippines – Signal No. 2 due to Tropical Storm Paolo (Matmo) was raised for the first time at 11 am on Thursday, October 2, as the tropical cyclone slightly strengthened again over the Philippine Sea.\nIn a press conference past 11 am on Thursday, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said Paolo now has maximum sustained winds of 75 kilometers per hour from the previous 65 km/h. Its gustiness is now up to 90 km/h from 80 km/h.\nPaolo is now projected to intensify into a severe tropical storm on Friday evening. Under PAGASA’s classification, a severe tropical storm has maximum sustained winds of 89 to 117 km/h.\nAs of 10 am, Paolo was located 575 kilometers east of Infanta, Quezon. It is still moving west northwest at 20 km/h, heading for the southern portion of Isabela or the northern portion of Aurora, where it could make landfall on Friday morning, October 3.\nThere is still a possibility of Paolo becoming a typhoon before landfall, although this is more likely to occur once it is already over the West Philippine Sea.\nPAGASA reiterated that a southward or downward shift in Paolo’s track remains possible as well, “depending on the strength of the high pressure area” above it.\nHere are the areas under tropical cyclone wind signals as of 11 am on Thursday:\nSignal No. 2 Gale-force winds (62 to 88 km/h), minor to moderate threat to life and property\nsoutheastern part of Isabela (San Mariano, Dinapigue, San Guillermo, Echague, Jones, San Agustin, Benito Soliven, Angadanan, Cauayan City, Naguilian) northern part of Quirino (Maddela) northern part of Aurora (Dilasag, Casiguran, Dinalungan) Signal No. 1 Strong winds (39 to 61 km/h), minimal to minor threat to life and property\nCagayan rest of Isabela rest of Quirino Nueva Vizcaya Apayao Abra Kalinga Mountain Province Ifugao Benguet Ilocos Norte Ilocos Sur La Union Pangasinan northern part of Zambales (Palauig, Masinloc, Candelaria, Santa Cruz) Tarlac Nueva Ecija rest of Aurora northern part of Bulacan (Doña Remedios Trinidad, San Miguel, San Ildefonso, Norzagaray, San Rafael) northern part of Pampanga (Magalang, Arayat, Candaba, Mabalacat City) northern part of Quezon (General Nakar, Infanta) including Polillo Islands northern part of Camarines Norte (Capalonga, Jose Panganiban, Paracale, Vinzons, Talisay, Daet, Mercedes, Basud) northern part of Camarines Sur (Siruma, Tinambac, Lagonoy, Garchitorena, Caramoan) northern part of Catanduanes (Pandan, Bagamanoc, Panganiban, Viga, Caramoran) Signal No. 4 would be the highest possible tropical cyclone wind signal if Paolo becomes a typhoon before landfall.\nMeanwhile, PAGASA updated its rainfall outlook for Paolo, also at 11 am on Thursday. Much of the rainfall is expected on Friday.\nThursday noon, October 2, to Friday noon, October 3\nIntense to torrential rain (above 200 millimeters): Aurora Heavy to intense rain (100-200 mm): Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija Moderate to heavy rain (50-100 mm): Apayao, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Benguet, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Rizal, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon Friday noon, October 3, to Saturday noon, October 4\nIntense to torrential rain (above 200 mm): La Union, Benguet Heavy to intense rain (100-200 mm): Aurora, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Abra, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Pangasinan, Ilocos Sur, Zambales Moderate to heavy rain (50-100 mm): Cagayan, Apayao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Bataan, Pampanga, Bulacan There is also a moderate risk of “life-threatening” storm surges with peak heights reaching 1 to 2 meters in Ilocos Norte, Cagayan, Isabela, Aurora, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Catanduanes within 36 hours.
