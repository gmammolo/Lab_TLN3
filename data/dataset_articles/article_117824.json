Please consider supporting SCMP’s journalism by subscribing.\\nThe Hong Kong Observatory will consider issuing the No 1 typhoon warning on Friday night as a tropical storm moves across the Philippines and enters the South China Sea.\\nThe forecaster said on Thursday that Tropical Storm Matmo was centred about 610km (380 miles) east of Manila at noon and was moving west-northwest at about 22km/h (13.7mph) towards the vicinity of Luzon, while continuing to intensify.\\n“[Matmo] will move across Luzon and enter the central and northern parts of the South China Sea,” it said.\\n“It will then move in the general direction of the vicinity of the coast of western Guangdong to the eastern part of Hainan Island. However, its intensity remains uncertain.\\n“Under its influence, it will be windy with squally showers over the coast of southern China during the weekend.”\\nThe Observatory also said that an anticyclone aloft would bring generally fine and very hot weather to southern China on Friday.\\nIt added that the weather would improve along the Guangdong coast during the Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Monday next week, and the following day, but showers linked to an upper-level disturbance were expected to continue affecting the area.\\nAccording to the latest nine-day weather forecast, showers are expected from Saturday onwards, with temperatures likely to reach as high as 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 Fahrenheit) on Friday.\\nMatmo – which means “heavy rain” in the Chamorro language of Guam – will be the fourth storm to approach Hong Kong in five weeks.\\n",
