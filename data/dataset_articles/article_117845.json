  "text": "Published : 02 Oct 2025, 11:23 AM\nThe depression that formed in the Bay of Bengal has intensified into a deep depression, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) says.\nIn a special weather bulletin issued on Thursday morning, the Met Office said the depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal and adjacent areas has moved northwest and intensified into a deep depression over the west-central and adjacent northwest Bay.\nAt 6am, it was located 875km southwest of the Chattogram port, 830km southwest of the Cox's Bazar port, 735km southwest of the Mongla port and 740km southwest of the Payra port.\nThe BMD says it may move further north-northwest. Under its influence, a steep pressure gradient is persisting over the north Bay.\nThe weather system is likely to lead to gusty or squally weather at the maritime ports, the north Bay, and the adjoining coastal areas of Bangladesh.\nThe maximum sustained wind speed within 48km of the depression is 50kph, increasing to 60 kph in gusts and squalls. The sea will stay rough near the deep depression’s centre.\nThe maritime ports at Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Mongla and Payra have been instructed to keep local cautionary signal No. 3 hoisted. Fishing boats and trawlers in the north Bay are advised to remain close to the coast and stay cautious so that they can reach safe shelter at short notice.\nA low-pressure system formed in the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday. Later that night, the low developed into a depression. On Thursday, it developed into a deep depression.\nThe weather system has led to heavy rain in parts of Bangladesh, including Dhaka. The capital’s skies have been cloudy since the morning, with intermittent rain.\nThe BMD’s regular bulletin on Wednesday night said that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty winds are likely to occur in most parts of the Rangpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Dhaka, Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram and Sylhet divisions in the 24 hours from 6pm. Along with this, heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur in some places across the country.\nAs a result, daytime temperatures across the country may drop by two to three degrees, while the night temperatures may drop slightly.",
