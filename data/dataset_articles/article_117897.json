  "text": "A 50-year-old woman was swept away by floods in Dumka, Jharkhand as the state experiences heavy rainfall, prompting orange and yellow alerts. More showers are expected in the coming days as the IMD forecasts light to moderate rainfall and isolated thunderstorms with gusty winds, amidst the Dusshera festival celebrations. Heavy rains have caused chaos in Jharkhand, where a 50-year-old woman was tragically swept away by floodwaters in Dumka district. The state grapples with extreme weather conditions, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue several weather alerts. An orange alert has been declared for Garhwa, Palamu, and Chatra districts, while a yellow alert remains in place for Latehar, Hazaribag, Bokaro, Koderma, Giridih, and Dhanbad until October 4. Savitri Devi, the victim, was caught in knee-deep water, unable to see the danger lying ahead. Forecasts predict continued rainfall with isolated thunderstorms throughout Jharkhand till October 6. The IMD warns of temperature drops by 3-5 degrees Celsius, coinciding with the ongoing Dusshera festival, impacting daily life across several districts.",
