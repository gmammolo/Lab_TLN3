  "text": "Next Article\nUmbrella weather in Odisha as deep depression heads toward coast\nIndia\nOdisha is in for some serious rain as a deep depression from the Bay of Bengal heads toward its coast.\nThe system picked up strength on Wednesday night, soaking coastal and southern areas.\nOn Thursday, the IMD put all 30 districts on heavy rain alert, so it's definitely umbrella weather across the state.\nRed alert for Puri, Jagatsinghpur\nThe IMD has flagged \"red\" alerts for Puri and Jagatsinghpur (expecting over 20cm rain), \"orange\" for 14 districts, and \"yellow\" elsewhere.\nThe government isn't taking chances—teams and gear are ready in flood-prone spots, fishermen have been told to stay off the sea till October 3, and ports are on high alert for strong winds.\nThe system is set to cross between Gopalpur and Paradip by the night of October 2.",
