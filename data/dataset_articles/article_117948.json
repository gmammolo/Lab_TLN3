  "text": "The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for wind across parts of Wales this weekend as Storm Amy moves in, with disruption expected from Friday evening through to late on Saturday.\nThe warning is in place from 6pm on Friday, 3 October, until 11.59pm on Saturday, 4 October.\nGusts of 50 to 60mph are likely across many areas, with exposed coasts and hills seeing stronger winds that could exceed 70mph. Forecasters say the strongest gusts are expected further north, but conditions in parts of north Wales, including Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, and Anglesey, could still prove disruptive.\nHeavy rain is also expected in some areas, adding to difficult travel conditions.\nWhat to expect\n-\nDamage to buildings is possible, with tiles blown from roofs\n-\nPower cuts may occur, affecting other services such as mobile coverage\n-\nFlying debris could cause injuries or danger to life\n-\nLarge waves may hit coastal areas, with the risk of beach material being thrown onto roads and properties\n-\nRoad, rail, air and ferry services may be disrupted, with delays and cancellations possible\nStaying safe\nThe Met Office is urging residents to secure outdoor items such as bins, garden furniture and trampolines, and to take care when travelling. Motorists are advised to check road conditions and public transport updates before setting off.\nPeople living in coastal areas are reminded to take extra care, avoid walking close to breaking waves, and keep dogs on leads.\nThe storm is expected to ease across Wales on Saturday afternoon, although strong winds will persist further north into the evening before conditions improve overnight.",
