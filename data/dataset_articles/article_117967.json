  "text": "It’s technically fall, with October getting underway today, but you wouldn’t know it by stepping outside.\nMany U.S. states are dealing with a heat wave, with temperatures in the 80s for much of the country. The high temperatures are not expected to stop, either. Several U.S. states will be dealing with seriously high, abnormal October temperatures in the second week of the month.\n“Summer Version 5.0 is loading…” Max Velocity, a popular meteorologist, shared on X this evening.\nSeveral U.S. states will be dealing with 90 percent above normal temperatures from October 6 through October 10.\nAs a reminder, here’s what to do during a heat wave:\n- Never leave people or pets in a closed car on a warm day.\n- If air conditioning is not available in your home find a cooling option.\n- Take cool showers or baths.\n- Wear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing.\n- Use your oven less to help reduce the temperature in your home.\n- If you’re outside, find shade. Wear a hat wide enough to protect your face.\n- Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\n- Avoid high-energy activities or work outdoors, during midday heat, if possible.\n- Check on family members, older adults and neighbors.\n- Watch for heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n- Consider pet safety. If they are outside, make sure they have plenty of cool water and access to comfortable shade. Asphalt and dark pavement can be very hot to your pet’s feet.\n- Heat waves may cause you to lose power. Visit\nPower Outagesto learn how to stay safe.\nStay cool, everyone.",
