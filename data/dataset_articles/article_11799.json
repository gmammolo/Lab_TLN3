The reliefs sought included quashing of the refund rejection order and the appellate order confirming it, a declaration that the rejection was without authority and jurisdiction, and a direction to grant refund of ITC along with interest.\nThe petitioner is engaged in providing Research and Development services and other business support services to its parent company located in Sweden. For the period from April 2022 to September 2022, it provided services treated as export of services and issued export invoices endorsed as “Export of Services without payment of IGST” under a Letter of Undertaking (LUT). On this basis, the petitioner claimed refund of accumulated and unutilized ITC available in its electronic credit ledger.\nThe refund application was rejected by the jurisdictional authority on the ground that the petitioner had wrongly treated local supply of services as export of services. The appellate authority dismissed the petitioner’s appeal and confirmed the rejection. Aggrieved by both orders, the petitioner approached the High Court.\nThe respondents opposed the petition, contending that upon verification of facts, the petitioner was found to have incorrectly classified local supply of services as export of services, and therefore the refund claim was rightly rejected.\nUpon examination of the material on record, the Court found that the petitioner was not an “intermediary.” The Court noted that in similar factual situations, it had already held that such service providers were entitled to refund of accumulated ITC in cases of export of services without payment of IGST. The Court relied upon its earlier decisions in M/s. Amazon Development Centre India Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Tax GST (Appeals), Bengaluru, M/s. Columbia Sportswear India Sourcing Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, M/s. Athene Technologies India LLP v. State of Karnataka, and Nokia Solutions & Networks India Pvt. Ltd. v. Principal Commissioner of Central Tax.\nIn light of these precedents and the facts of the case, the Court concluded that the impugned orders rejecting the refund claim were unsustainable. Accordingly, the writ petition was allowed. The Court set aside both the refund rejection order and the appellate order and directed the respondents to sanction and grant refund of the accumulated and unutilized ITC along with applicable interest within three months from the date of receipt of the order.\nFULL TEXT OF THE JUDGMENT/ORDER OF KARNATAKA HIGH COURT\nIn this petition, petitioner seeks for the following reliefs:-\n“ a) Issue a writ of certiorari, or a writ or order or direction in the nature of writ of certiorari and set aside the Impugned Order passed under Section 107(11) of the CGST Act vide Order No.ZD2904240547833 dated: 22.04.2024, issued by the 4th Respondent enclosed as Annexure-B as bad in law.\nb) Issue a writ of certiorari, or a writ or order or direction in the nature of writ of certiorari and to hold that the Refund Rejection Order in Form GST RFD-06 vide No.ACCT-LGSTO-38/RFD-06/2023-24 dated: 24.05.2023, enclosed as Annexure-G issued by 3rd Respondent was passed without the authority of law and without jurisdiction.\nC) Issue a writ of mandamus, or a writ or order or direction in the nature of writ of mandamus by ordering the Respondent No.3 to refund the accumulated/unutilized ITC available in the electronic credit ledger along with interest.\nd) Issue any other direction or grant any other relief, as deemed fit in the facts and circumstances of this case, in the interest of justice.\ne) Issue a direction to provide for the cost of this petition.”\n2. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and learned CGC as well as learned HCGP for the respondents and perused the material on record.\n3. The material on record will indicate that the petitioner is engaged in the business of providing Research and Development services and other business support services to its Parent company namely Bluefish Pharmaceuticals AB, Sweden. During the period April, 2022 to September, 2022, the petitioner having provided export of services, Export Invoices were issued with an endorsement “Export of Services without payment of IGST” under the Letter of Undertaking (LUT). It is the grievance of the petitioner that though the petitioner is not an ‘intermediary’, was entitled to refund of accumulated / unutilized input tax credit (ITC) available in their Electronic credit ledger on account of the export of services without payment of IGST, the refund application filed by the petitioner was rejected by the respondents by passing the impugned order, against which, the petitioner filed appeal, which is also dismissed by the respondents. Aggrieved by the impugned orders passed by the respondents rejecting refund application / claim of the petitioner and confirmed by the appellate authority, petitioner is before this Court by way of the present petition.\n4. The respondents have filed their statement of objections contesting / opposing the petition and seeking dismissal of the same. It is contended that the 3rd respondent has verified the facts and circumstances of the case and noticed that the petitioner has wrongly claimed local supply of services as export of services and hence, the claim of the petitioner was rejected.\n5. A perusal of the material on record will indicate that the petitioner is not an ‘intermediary’ and that the petitioner would be entitled to refund as sought for by him in the light of the following judgments:-\n(i) M/s. Amazon Development Centre India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Commissioner of Central Tax GST (Appeals), Bengaluru – 2025 (5) TMI 150 – Karnataka;\n(ii) M/s. Columbia Sportswear India Sourcing Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Union of India – 2025 (5) TMI 2139 – Karnataka;\n(iii) M/s. Athene Technologies India LLP Vs. The State of Karnataka – 2025 (6) TMI 88 – Karnataka and\n(iv) Nokia Solutions & Networks India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. The Principal Commissioner of Central Tax – 2025-VIL-515-KAR.\n6. In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances and the judgments of this Court in the aforesaid cases as stated supra, I am of the considered opinion that the impugned orders deserve to be quashed and the respondents be directed to grant refund in favour of the petitioner together with applicable interest within a stipulated time frame.\n7. In the result, I pass the following:-\nORDER\n(i) Petition is hereby allowed.\n(ii) The impugned order at Annexure-B dated 22.04.2024 passed by the 4th respondent and the impugned rejection order at Annexure-G dated 24.05.2023 passed by the 3rd respondent are hereby set aside.\n(iii) The concerned respondents are hereby directed to grant / sanction refund of the accumulated / unutilized ITC available in the electronic credit ledger together with applicable interest in favour of the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.\nPrivacy Policy&\nComplete Terms of Use and Disclaimer.\nJoin Taxguru’s Network for Latest updates on Income Tax, GST, Company Law, Corporate Laws and other related subjects.\nCancel reply",
