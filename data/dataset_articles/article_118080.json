  "text": "The storm that ripped through Indiana June 29 proved to be one of the most devastating to ever hit Duke Energy’s Indiana system. It was followed by multiple waves of storms for several days that added to the destruction. Approximately 330,000 power outages occurred as more than 150 miles of power lines and more than 200 utility poles succumbed to the storms’ violent winds. Only Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused more damage in our Indiana service area.\nWe’re grateful to our customers who waited patiently for their power to be restored. Storms are rarely convenient, disrupting evenings, holidays and weekends. However, they also have a way of bringing out the best in our communities. We brought in more than 1,000 additional workers to supplement our statewide workforce, and when they needed lodging or staging areas, Indiana University, Indiana State University, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and DePauw University opened their campuses.",
