  "text": "Risks To Shareholder Returns Are Elevated At These Prices For AutoStore Holdings Ltd. (OB:AUTO)\nWhen close to half the companies in Norway have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 14x, you may consider AutoStore Holdings Ltd. (OB:AUTO) as a stock to avoid entirely with its 53.5x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\nFor example, consider that AutoStore Holdings' financial performance has been poor lately as its earnings have been in decline. It might be that many expect the company to still outplay most other companies over the coming period, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n See our latest analysis for AutoStore Holdings\nfree data-rich visualisationto see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nIs There Enough Growth For AutoStore Holdings?\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as AutoStore Holdings' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.\nIf we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 51%. Regardless, EPS has managed to lift by a handy 7.6% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.\nThis is in contrast to the rest of the market, which is expected to grow by 28% over the next year, materially higher than the company's recent medium-term annualised growth rates.\nWith this information, we find it concerning that AutoStore Holdings is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance existing shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with recent growth rates.\nWhat We Can Learn From AutoStore Holdings' P/E?\nIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.\nWe've established that AutoStore Holdings currently trades on a much higher than expected P/E since its recent three-year growth is lower than the wider market forecast. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as this earnings performance isn't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve markedly, it's very challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\nThere are also other vital risk factors to consider before investing and we've discovered 1 warning sign for AutoStore Holdings that you should be aware of.\nIf P/E ratios interest you, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place\nWe've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free.\n• Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n• Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n• Track the Fair Value of your stocks\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\nHave feedback on this article?
