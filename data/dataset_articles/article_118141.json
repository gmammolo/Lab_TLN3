  "text": "The upcoming winter in Russia will be colder than the previous one:\nThe upcoming winter in Russia will be colder than the previous one:\n\"The winter period from 2025 to 2026 will be significantly colder than the previous one. Almost all Russians should prepare for lower temperatures. Thus, a colder November should be expected in the north of the Central and Volga Federal Districts, in the Northwestern Federal District, in the north of the Ural Federal District, in the northern and central regions of the Siberian Federal District.\nColder January is observed in most of the European territory of Russia, in the central and southern regions of the Ural and Siberian Federal Districts. February will be colder in the northern half of the Krasnoyarsk Territory and in the west of Yakutia.\nHowever, in March, the average monthly temperature will be higher than normal in most of Russia.\"",
