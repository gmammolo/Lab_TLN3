  "text": "Deep depression over Bay: Signal 3 at ports, heavy rainfall expected countrywide\nLandslides may occur in the hilly regions of Chattogram, while temporary waterlogging is possible in areas of Dhaka and Chattogram cities\nA deep depression has formed over the Bay of Bengal, effects of which are being felt across the country.\nThe Bangladesh Meteorological Department forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall under the influence of the system and an active monsoon. Rainfall between 44 and 88 millimetres in 24 hours, and in some places more than 88 millimetres, is likely in Rangpur, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Dhaka, Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram and Sylhet divisions over the next 72 hours beginning Wednesday morning (1 October).\nThe Met Office has asked all four maritime ports to keep local cautionary signal No. 3 hoisted as a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal intensifies.\nIn a special bulletin issued today (2 October), the Met Office said the system over the west-central Bay and adjoining areas had strengthened into a deep depression, centred at 6am about 875 kilometres southwest of Chattogram port, 830 km from Cox's Bazar, 735 km from Mongla and 740 km from Payra. It is expected to move further north-northwest.\nWinds near the centre were clocked at 50 kilometres per hour, rising to 60 kph in gusts and squalls. Seas will remain rough and a steep pressure gradient continues over the North Bay, the bulletin said.\nAs a result, gusty and squally weather may hit the coastal districts, maritime ports, and adjoining sea areas. Fishing boats and trawlers have been advised to remain close to the coast and proceed with caution until further notice. Mariners were also urged to be prepared to take shelter on short notice.\nThe bulletin also cautioned that landslides may occur in the hilly regions of Chattogram, while temporary waterlogging is possible in low-lying areas of Dhaka and Chattogram city.\nMeanwhile, loading-unloading of cargo at the outer anchorage has been disrupted since Thursday morning due to heavy rainfall.\nConfirming the matter Chattogram Port Authority (CPA) secretary Omar Faruk told The Business Standard, \"When it rains the hedges of bulk carriers remain closed suspending unloading cargo at the outer anchorage. The rough sea also disrupts laoding-unloading activities.\"",
