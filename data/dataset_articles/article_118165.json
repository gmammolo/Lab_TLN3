  "text": "By Martha Sanchez ,\n10 hours ago\nStrong winds could wash water from the Mississippi Sound across streets in Waveland this week, the National Weather Service said.\nForecasters are predicting coastal flooding could swamp normally-dry ground with up to 2 feet of water. The risk is highest in Waveland because its shoreline faces east and winds will blow water towards it.\nThe flooding could begin Friday and last through Sunday, forecasters said. Winds of 25 to 30 mph through the weekend are also expected to create 3 to 5 foot waves in the Mississippi Sound.\nThe minor coastal flooding in Waveland and its surrounding areas will probably come at high tide, said Hannah Lisney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Slidell. She said the whole Mississippi Coast was at risk for some minor coastal flooding as well.\n“It’s just like a higher than normal tide,” Lisney said.",
