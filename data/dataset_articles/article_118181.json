  "text": "Red-level magnetic storm hits the planet: scientists warn of new strikes\nGeomagnetic disturbances that began on September 29 continue to have an impact on October 2. According to forecasts, increased solar activity will last for at least two more days.\nThis was reported by the British Geological Survey and Meteoagent.\nIt is noted that the current fluctuations are caused by a combination of several factors: the lingering effects of the coronal mass ejection that occurred on September 24, the residual effects of the coronal hole, and the early arrival of the high-speed solar wind stream.\nDuring October 2, periods of increased activity are expected – in some places, magnetic storms of the G1 level are possible, and in some places even G2. The greatest risk of disturbances also remains on October 3 and 4, although the intensity of the storms will gradually decrease.\nG2 storms are classified as moderate: they occur a few dozen times a year and are accompanied by a planetary Kp index of 6. Such phenomena can affect radio communications, satellite systems, and also contribute to the appearance of auroras at latitudes where they are not usually visible.\nFor most people, geomagnetic storms are not dangerous, but those who are weather-sensitive may experience headaches, fatigue, irritability, or changes in blood pressure. Doctors advise avoiding unnecessary stress, heavy physical exertion, and getting more rest during these days.\nAlso follow “Pryamim” on Facebook , Twitter , Telegram , and Instagram.",
