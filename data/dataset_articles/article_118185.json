  "text": "California storm to bring snowfall as temperatures plunge in early winter weather blast\nA cold Pacific storm is poised to sweep over California's Sierra Nevada, bringing snowfall and a drop in temperature.\nAlthough California has a reputation for having a lot of sun, those living near the mountain ranges will know all about the snowfall during Winter.\nThis week, a storm will impact Central California, bringing snowfall and a drop in temperature and marking the beginning of Winter for the state.\nThe National Weather Service says that a cold Pacific Storm will enter the region on Thursday and move over the Central and Southern Sierra Nevada by Thursday night. This storm will allow snowfall near Tioga Pass.\nWhile the snowfall will be limited, enough will fall to cover the ground near the east entrance to Yosemite National Park (Tioga Pass).\n\"The probability of 1 inch or more and 4 inches or more is displayed, with the best chances favoring the Tioga Pass Area. The snow will be expected later this week (near Friday) with accumulation closer to 1 inch,\" says the NWS.\nThe cold Pacific storm will cause temperatures in the area to drop, and precipitation will fall as snow. This is expected over the higher terrain of the Sierra Nevada, where Tioga Pass has a 60 percent chance of seeing less than 3 inches of snow.\nThe snowfall advisory is valid until 5 am on Saturday.\nThe new 'Water Year'\nAt this time of year, rainfall starts to become mountain snow in certain parts of California, so this cold Pacific Storm is not unusual.\nWater experts consider October the start of a new \"water\" year, especially in the Western United States. This is when the majority of precipitation shifts from rain to mountain snow and snowpack begins collecting. This period runs from October 1 to September 30.\nWhile the state has been experiencing unusually late wildfires this year, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) is preparing for potential extreme weather swings this Winter.\nThe state experienced its first snow of the year with a light snowfall on Tuesday's summit of Mammoth Mountain, California, in the Eastern Sierra.\nThe mountain plans to open its ski slopes for the 2024-25 winter season on November 14.",
