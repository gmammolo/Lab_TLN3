  "text": "MANILA, Philippines – Tropical Storm Paolo (Matmo) maintained its strength and speed over the Philippine Sea, with its center hundreds of kilometers away from the province of Quezon, early Thursday afternoon, October 2.\nIt continues to have maximum sustained winds of 75 kilometers per hour and gustiness of up to 90 km/h, based on the 2 pm bulletin of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).\nBut Paolo remains likely to intensify into a severe tropical storm on Thursday evening. Under PAGASA’s classification, a severe tropical storm has maximum sustained winds of 89 to 117 km/h.\nPaolo was last spotted 530 kilometers east of Infanta, Quezon, at 1 pm on Thursday. It is moving west at 20 km/h, still heading for the southern portion of Isabela or the northern portion of Aurora, where it could make landfall on Friday morning, October 3.\nThere is still a possibility of Paolo becoming a typhoon before landfall, although this is more likely to occur once it is already over the West Philippine Sea.\nPAGASA reiterated that a southward or downward shift in Paolo’s track remains possible as well, “depending on the strength of the high pressure area” above it.\nSeveral areas were upgraded to Signal No. 2, while a few were added under Signal No. 1, as of 2 pm on Thursday. Below are all the areas under tropical cyclone wind signals .\nSignal No. 2 Gale-force winds (62 to 88 km/h), minor to moderate threat to life and property\ncentral and southern parts of Isabela (San Mariano, Dinapigue, San Guillermo, Echague, Jones, San Agustin, Benito Soliven, Angadanan, Naguilian, Palanan, Ilagan City, Quirino, Mallig, Quezon, Delfin Albano, Tumauini, Cordon, Santiago City, San Isidro, Ramon, Alicia, San Mateo, Cabatuan, Cauayan City, Reina Mercedes, Luna, Gamu, Burgos, San Manuel, Aurora, Roxas) northern part of Quirino (Maddela, Aglipay, Cabarroguis, Saguday, Diffun) northern part of Nueva Vizcaya (Diadi, Bagabag, Quezon, Solano, Villaverde, Ambaguio, Bayombong, Kasibu) eastern part of Mountain Province (Paracelis, Natonin, Barlig) Ifugao northern part of Aurora (Dilasag, Casiguran, Dinalungan) Signal No. 1 Strong winds (39 to 61 km/h), minimal to minor threat to life and property\nCagayan rest of Isabela rest of Quirino rest of Nueva Vizcaya Apayao Abra Kalinga rest of Mountain Province Benguet Ilocos Norte Ilocos Sur La Union Pangasinan northern part of Zambales (Palauig, Masinloc, Candelaria, Santa Cruz) Tarlac Nueva Ecija rest of Aurora northern part of Bulacan (Doña Remedios Trinidad, San Miguel, San Ildefonso, Norzagaray, San Rafael) northern part of Pampanga (Magalang, Arayat, Candaba, Mabalacat City) northern part of Quezon (General Nakar, Infanta) including Polillo Islands Camarines Norte northern part of Camarines Sur (Siruma, Tinambac, Lagonoy, Garchitorena, Caramoan, Goa, San Jose, Presentacion) Catanduanes Signal No. 4 would be the highest possible tropical cyclone wind signal if Paolo becomes a typhoon before landfall.\nFor rainfall, PAGASA maintained the outlook it issued earlier at 11 am, covering the next 48 hours.\nThursday noon, October 2, to Friday noon, October 3\nIntense to torrential rain (above 200 millimeters): Aurora Heavy to intense rain (100-200 mm): Cagayan, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Nueva Ecija Moderate to heavy rain (50-100 mm): Apayao, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Benguet, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Rizal, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon Friday noon, October 3, to Saturday noon, October 4\nIntense to torrential rain (above 200 mm): La Union, Benguet Heavy to intense rain (100-200 mm): Aurora, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Abra, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Pangasinan, Ilocos Sur, Zambales Moderate to heavy rain (50-100 mm): Cagayan, Apayao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Bataan, Pampanga, Bulacan In addition, there is now a moderate to high risk of “life-threatening” storm surges with peak heights reaching 1 to 3 meters in Ilocos Norte, Cagayan, Isabela, Aurora, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Catanduanes within 36 hours.
