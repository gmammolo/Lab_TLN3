  "text": "Authorities issued fresh weather alerts on Wednesday as a developing storm in the northeast Arabian Sea is likely to bring rainfall and gusty winds to Sindh, while a separate westerly system could trigger heavy showers across Punjab early next week.\nAccording to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), a strong low-pressure zone that earlier formed near India’s Saurashtra coast has now advanced into the Arabian Sea. Positioned about 310 kilometers southeast of Karachi, the system is expected to strengthen into a tropical depression within the next 12 hours.\nUnder its influence, Karachi and 11 districts of southern Sindh — including Tharparkar, Umerkot, Badin, and Mirpurkhas — are likely to see light to moderate rainfall accompanied by winds of up to 55 km/h on Tuesday.\nThe PMD has cautioned fishermen against going into the open sea until at least October 3, warning of rough to very rough sea conditions through Thursday. Authorities also fear that strong winds and lightning could damage fragile infrastructure such as mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles, and solar panels.\nThis warning comes amid one of the most devastating monsoon seasons Pakistan has seen in years. Since late June, more than 1,000 people have lost their lives nationwide, while over 4.7 million people in Punjab alone have been affected by floods. Around 4,700 villages remain submerged, with more than 2.5 million people displaced and extensive crop damage reported in cotton, rice, and sugarcane fields.\nPunjab now faces additional flood threats, with the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) predicting that a strong westerly wave will hit northern and northeastern areas — including the upper catchments of major rivers — between October 5 and 7. This system is forecast to bring heavy to very heavy rainfall along with thunderstorms.\nAlthough current water levels at the Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri barrages remain normal, authorities remain wary of sudden surges that could overwhelm embankments and lead to flash flooding.\nIn Karachi, the weather is expected to stay humid and partly cloudy, with daytime temperatures ranging between 33 and–36°C. Occasional drizzle or light rain may occur through Friday, while hot and dry conditions are likely in other parts of Sindh, unaffected by the storm.\nProvincial disaster management authorities in Sindh and Punjab have placed local administrations on high alert, instructing deputy commissioners and disaster committees to maintain 24/7 monitoring and submit daily situation reports as the new weather systems draw closer.",
