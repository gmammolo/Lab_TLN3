  "text": "By Reanna Smith ,\n1 hours ago Florida's coastline is facing threats, including dangerous rip currents, high surf, flooding , and erosion, as it feels the impacts of Hurricane Imelda .\nImelda strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane by late Wednesday and was nearly on top of Bermuda as forecasters warned the storm was expected to bring potentially destructive weather . “Imelda’s core now moving over Bermuda where hurricane-force winds, damaging waves, and flash flooding expected into the morning,” the National Weather Service in Miami said in an 11 pm update.\nImelda was about 20 miles (30 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) while moving east-northeast at 29 mph (46 kph), the center said. While Imelda won't directly impact the US, the storm's remnants have been generating dangerous surf and deadly rip currents across much of the US East Coast.\nREAD MORE: Gavin Newsom shares picture of JD Vance in drag amid Super Bowl backlash\nREAD MORE: CNN anchor sides with South Park as he unleashes furious rant at 'smelly' Donald Trump\nHeavy rainfall threat returns to Florida Dry and bright conditions didn't last long as the rainy season makes a swift return this week.\nIn south Florida , showers and storms could lead to localized urban flooding from Thursday through to Sunday, the National Weather Service (NWS) in Miami warns.\n\"Locations impacted by heavy rain multiple times tonight through Sunday could experience urban flooding,\" the agency said on Wednesday night. \"Turn around. Don't drown,\" the weather experts warned.\nRounds of heavy rain will be possible during the day and overnight. Widespread totals of 1-2 inches are expected, with reasonable high end amounts of around 4-6+ inches. Locally higher amounts are also possible.\nExcessive rainfall is also a risk around the central Florida coast. \"Rounds of showers will move onshore over the next few days. On the coast, the rain may become heavy at times leading to a localized flooding risk,\" the NWS in Melbourne warns.\nCoastal counties are expected to experience 1 to 3 inches of rain, sometimes up to 5 inches. Flooding could occur in urban and poor drainage areas.\nRip current statement issued A rip current statement is in effect across several coastal regions. A high rip current risk is in effect through to Sunday morning while a high surf advisory is in effect until 4am EDT Sunday.\nThe statement has been issued for Coastal Palm Beach County, Coastal Broward County, Coastal Volusia, Coastal Indian River, Coastal Saint Lucie, Coastal Martin, Mainland Northern Brevard, Northern Brevard Barrier Islands, Mainland Southern Brevard and Southern Brevard Barrier Islands Counties.\nBeachgoers are warned to be aware of dangerous rip currents while high surf will see large breaking waves of 6 to 10 feet in the surf zone.\n\"Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water,\" the NWS warns.\n\"Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions,\" the agency advises. \"Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don`t swim against the current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.\"\nHazardous marine conditions Tampa will also experience high surf as well as other hazardous marine conditions and flood risks.\n\"Winds are expected to increase across coastal waters tonight and remain elevated through the remainder of the week,\" the local NWS office said on Wednesday.\nWinds are expected to reach 20 to 25 knots across the Nature Coast, around 20 knots for Tampa Bay and adjacent waters, and 15 to 20 knots across SWFL.\nBay and inland waters will be choppy. Nearshore, seas will be 2 to 4ft, occasionally up to 5ft. While offshore, seas of 3 to 5ft, sometimes up to 6ft, are expected.\nA coastal flood watch has been issued in the region that will remain in effect from Thursday evening through to Sunday evening.\n\"Significant\" coastal flooding is possible in Coastal Flagler, Northeast Coastal St. Johns and Southeast Coastal St. Johns Counties, the NWS warns.\nA high surf advisory is in effect until 5am EFT Sunday as large breaking waves of 7 to 11 feet are expected while there will be a high rip current risk through to late Saturday night.\n\"Numerous roads may be closed. Low lying property including homes, businesses, and some critical infrastructure may be inundated,\" the NWS warns. \"Some shoreline erosion may occur.\"\nThe agency adds: \"Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away from shore into deeper water. If travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be closed.\n\"Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions.\"\n2",
