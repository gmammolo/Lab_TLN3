The warning came into force at 6am today and will remain in place until 8pm.\nA Status Yellow thunderstorm warning has also been extended to all counties in Connacht, where lightning damage is possible until 2pm.\nStorm Amy will bring very difficult travel conditions and is expected to cause flooding in Kerry, with the potential for further localised flooding in other counties.\nWinds could reach over 80kmh overland on Friday - potentially stronger in some exposed coastal areas - with officials concerned that power lines could be damaged.\nThere are also concerns that the wind and rain from the storm could cause travel disruption with fallen trees and storm debris.\nGardaí and local authorities have urged people to heed all necessary alerts and be aware that travelling conditions could be challenging in some areas on Friday.\nESB Networks have repair crews on standby to tackle any storm damage to power grids but warned their crews will only be able to deploy when it is safe to do so.\nStorm Amy, powered by former Hurricane Humberto and the Jet Stream, is the first named storm of the autumn-winter season.\nStatus Yellow rain warnings are also now in place for Cavan, Donegal and Longford, as well as all of Munster and Connacht, and will run until 8pm today.\nSeparately, a wind warning in place for counties Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo has been upgraded to a Status Orange tomorrow from 2pm until 10pm due to “near gale force to gale force”.\nFallen trees, damage to power lines and possible power outages, very difficult travelling conditions and possible wave overtopping are among the potential impacts.\nThe rest of the country will be under a Status Yellow wind warning from 12pm tomorrow until 12am on Saturday.\nMet Éireann forecaster Andrew Doran Sherlock said heavy rainfall and spot flooding can be expected in parts of the country today, before winds begin to pick up from midday tomorrow.\n\"Winds will pick up starting in the south-west, extending across the country and as it gets into the west and northwest it will really start picking up,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.\n\"It is coming with heavy rain for a time as well which is going to fall on an already saturated ground, so there is a chance of some further flooding tomorrow as well.”\nHe said the conditions also bring a chance of fallen tries, damage to power lines, and power outages.\n\"Tomorrow, we’ve got all of this (rain) on top of what has already fallen so yes, there certainly will be dangers on the road.”\nThe latest track shows the centre of the front missing Ireland as it heads towards Scandinavia, but there are concerns that it will pass close enough to Ireland’s north-west coast to bring damaging gale-force winds.\nFriday will be a wet and very windy day\nMotorists have been warned they could face challenging driving conditions including fallen trees, storm debris and localised flooding.\nA small craft marine warning is already in place for Thursday and Friday.\nMet Éireann has also issued a Status Yellow gale warning for Fair Head to Carlingford Lough, Carnsore Point and the Irish Sea from 5pm on Thursday until midnight on Friday as winds are expected to reach gale force eight.\nA Status Yellow gale warning - for winds up to strong gale force nine - will be in force for all Irish coasts and the Irish Sea from 9am on Friday until 3pm on Saturday.\nCommuters - particularly those in western and northwestern areas - have been warned to expect very unsettled and potentially challenging driving conditions on Friday.\nMet Éireann said the weather will be very unsettled over the coming days.\n“Today will be wet and blustery with widespread heavy rain, possibly leading to localised flooding,” a spokesperson said.\n“Southerly winds will increase, fresh and gusty through the day, strong at times near coasts – with highest temperatures of 13C to 17C.\n“Thursday night will see rain clear to the east followed by well-scattered showers and a few clear spells.\n“Cloud will thicken in the west and south later, with patchy rain developing near south-west coasts by morning, with lowest temperatures of 9C to 12C.\n“Friday will be a wet and very windy day, with heavy rain quickly spreading north-eastwards across the country through the morning.\nThere will be strong to near gale-force winds, and gusty south-westerly winds will develop as the rain spreads, with gales or strong gales possible on western and north-western coasts.\n“Rain will clear eastwards to showers in the evening with highest temperatures of 15C to 19C.”\n“It will remain windy on Friday night, with heavy showers or longer spells of rain and strong to near gale-force winds, with gales on western coasts, though winds will veer westerly and decrease fresh to strong by morning.\n“Saturday will be windy or blustery with strong and gusty westerly winds. It will be a brighter day though, with sunny spells and showers if somewhat cool with highest temperatures of 12C to 15C.”\n“It will be generally cloudy on Sunday, with scattered light showers and highest temperatures of 12C to 16C.”\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
