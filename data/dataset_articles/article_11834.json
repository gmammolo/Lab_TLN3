  "text": "LOS ANGELES , Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- The DJS Law Group reminds investors of a class action lawsuit against Fermi Inc. (\"Fermi \" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: FRMI ) for violations of the federal securities laws.\nShareholders who purchased shares of FRMI during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointments. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery.\nCLASS PERIOD: pursuant and/or traceable to Fermi's initial public offering (\"IPO\") conducted in October 2025, and/or between October 1, 2025, and December 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\nDEADLINE: March 6, 2026\nCASE DETAILS: According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market.
