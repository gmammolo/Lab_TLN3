  "text": "Manila, Philippines — The Philippines weather forecaster warned Thursday of dangerous flooding in coastal areas as Tropical Storm Matmo is set to hit the disaster-weary nation.\nThe cyclone, bringing winds of 75 kilometers an hour, is expected to strengthen into a severe tropical storm hours before it reaches the main island of Luzon on Friday morning.\n“There is a moderate to high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak heights reaching 1.0 to 3.0 meters within 36 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities” of northern and eastern Luzon, the national weather service said.\nStorm surges occur when strong winds push large volumes of seawater towards the coast, and have the potential to cause flooding, property damage and death.\nThere were no immediate government orders of evacuations, but the weather service said heavy rains are forecast and the seas will be rough and “risky for all types or tonnage of vessels.”\nMatmo is set to hit land just three days after a powerful magnitude-6.9 quake killed 72 people and destroyed nearly 600 homes in the central Philippines, leaving thousands sleeping out in the streets in fear of aftershocks.\nThe Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons each year, routinely striking disaster-prone areas where millions of people live in poverty.\nScientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the planet warms due to human-driven climate change.\nTyphoon Bualoi killed 37 people and forced 400,000 people to flee their homes in the northern Philippines last week.\nAnd Typhoon Ragasa killed 14 people in the country in late September.",
