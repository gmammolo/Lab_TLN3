  "text": "Binghamton, NY – The National Weather Service in Binghamton has issued a Freeze Warning through 8 AM Thursday morning for parts of upstate New York, including Delaware, Otsego, and Northern Oneida Counties.\nAccording to the NWS, temperatures are expected to drop into the upper 20s to lower 30s, creating widespread freezing conditions, especially in sheltered valleys.\nThese cold temperatures pose a risk to crops, gardens, and other sensitive vegetation. Unprotected outdoor plumbing could also be damaged if not properly insulated. Residents are urged to take precautions to protect plants, cover outdoor gardens, and check on exposed water systems.\nThe affected area includes communities such as Oneonta, Walton, Boonville, and Delhi.\nWhile temperatures are expected to rebound later in the day, forecasters say this morning’s freeze may bring the end of the growing season for parts of Central and Northern New York.",
