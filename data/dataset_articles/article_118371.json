  "text": "Peachtree City, GA – The National Weather Service has issued a Special Weather Statement warning of high fire danger conditions this afternoon and evening across parts of west central Georgia.\nAccording to the NWS, relative humidity values are expected to drop to 25 percent or lower for at least four hours, while winds from the east-northeast could reach 10 to 13 mph with gusts up to 20 mph. These dry and breezy conditions, combined with existing dry fuels, will increase the risk of outdoor fires spreading rapidly.\nCounties affected include Heard, Coweta, Fayette, Clayton, Spalding, Henry, Butts, Troup, Meriwether, Pike, Upson, Lamar, Monroe, Harris, Talbot, Taylor, Crawford, Bibb, Muscogee, Chattahoochee, Marion, Schley, Macon, Peach, Houston, Stewart, Webster, Sumter, Dooly, and Crisp.\nThe NWS urged residents to check with local burn permitting authorities before starting any outdoor fires. If burning is allowed, officials advise using extreme caution and keeping water and tools nearby to prevent flames from spreading.\nThese conditions are expected to last until midnight Thursday evening, after which humidity levels may rise and winds weaken.\nResidents are encouraged to avoid unnecessary outdoor burning today and to report any signs of smoke or fire to local authorities immediately.",
