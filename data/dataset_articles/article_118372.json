  "text": "Flagstaff, AZ – A Wind Advisory has been issued for much of northern Arizona on Friday, with the National Weather Service (NWS) Flagstaff warning of hazardous gusts and possible travel disruptions.\nAccording to the advisory, strong south winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts reaching up to 45 mph are expected from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. MST (noon to 8 p.m. MDT) on Friday, October 3. The advisory covers the Kaibab Plateau, Grand Canyon Country, Coconino Plateau, Kaibito Plateau, Little Colorado River Valley, Painted Desert, Black Mesa, and surrounding areas.\nThe NWS cautions that unsecured outdoor items may be blown around and tree limbs could snap, potentially causing isolated power outages. Travel will be especially difficult for high-profile vehicles such as RVs, campers, and tractor-trailers.\nCommunities likely to be affected include Winslow, Holbrook, Tuba City, Grand Canyon Village, Snowflake, Navajo National Monument, Jacob Lake, and Keams Canyon.\nResidents are advised to secure outdoor furniture, trash bins, and other objects that could become airborne in high winds. Motorists are urged to use extra caution, particularly when driving along open stretches of highway.\nThe Wind Advisory remains in effect until early Friday evening, after which winds are expected to gradually diminish.",
