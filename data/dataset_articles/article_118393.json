  "text": "KATHMANDU, Oct 2: The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) has urged the public to adopt special precautions from October 4–6, citing the possibility of heavy rainfall and sudden flooding.\nThe department warned that small rivers in Bagmati Province—including Kathmandu Valley, Kavre, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Makwanpur, and Chitwan—Koshi Province’s Sankhuwasabha, Taplejung, Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, and Madhesh Province’s Bara, Parsa, Sarlahi, Rautahat and surrounding districts may witness sudden surges in water flow.\nRelated story\nHeavy rainfall forecast in Bagmati, several provinces\nAccording to the department, a low-pressure system developed in the Bay of Bengal has entered inland Odisha, India, and is gradually moving toward central India. As a result, monsoon winds are expected to intensify in Nepal from October 3 to 6, particularly affecting Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.\nThe analysis suggests that during this period, water levels in major rivers such as Narayani, Bagmati, Kamala, Koshi, and their tributaries could rise significantly, potentially reaching danger levels. Flash floods are also likely in small rivers and streams flowing through the Mahabharat and Chure ranges of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces.\nSince the monsoon has not yet withdrawn from Nepal, the DHM said it is continuously monitoring possible extreme weather and flood conditions. “Therefore, the department requests everyone to remain alert by regularly following updates and forecasts disseminated through our website, social media, toll-free service (1155), and other official channels,” it said.\nThe department has also called on all disaster risk reduction and management authorities, as well as the general public, to remain prepared to minimize possible damage from floods, inundation, landslides, erosion, and disruptions to road and air transport.\nRSS",
