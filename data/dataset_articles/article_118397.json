  "text": "HASTINGS, Neb. – South-central Nebraska faces a blustery start to the weekend, with winds expected to roar up to 50 mph Saturday afternoon. Drivers on U.S. 281 and I-80 should prepare for difficult travel conditions, especially for high-profile vehicles.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Hastings, gusty south winds will pick up Saturday, October 4, and continue into the evening. Thunderstorm chances return Saturday night and linger through Tuesday, bringing potential lightning and heavy downpours to parts of Nebraska and north-central Kansas.\nCommunities from Kearney to Hastings and down into Franklin and Webster Counties could see impacts from these shifting patterns. While severe weather is not currently expected, even non-severe storms may briefly reduce visibility and create slick roads. Officials urge residents to secure outdoor Halloween decorations early, as Saturday’s gusts could scatter items across yards and streets.\nFriday will be sunny and warm, with highs near 87, offering one last calm day before the weather turns unsettled. Sunday’s highs dip into the upper 70s, followed by cooler and wetter conditions early next week. Monday and Tuesday both carry a 30 to 40 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms.\nFall conditions remain changeable, and forecasters say additional advisories are possible if storm risks increase. Residents are encouraged to monitor updated alerts and plan outdoor activities before Saturday afternoon’s winds peak.\nFive Day Forecast for Hastings, Nebraska\n- Thursday: Sunny, high near 87.\n- Friday: Sunny, high near 87. Winds up to 25 mph.\n- Saturday: Breezy, high near 87. Gusts up to 50 mph.\n- Sunday: Sunny, high near 78. Thunderstorm chances overnight.\n- Monday: 30–40% chance of storms, high near 62.",
