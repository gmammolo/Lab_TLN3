  "text": "Morehead City residents face a wet and windy Thursday before a stretch of calmer fall weather arrives by the weekend.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Newport, a Coastal Flood Advisory remains in effect until 8 p.m. Thursday for Carteret County. Up to two feet of saltwater inundation is possible along Bogue Banks, Bogue Sound, and the Newport and White Oak Rivers. The advisory also includes tidal creeks, where water may flood parking lots, parks, and sections of U.S. 70.\nThe NWS also warns of a moderate rip current risk along local beaches. Swimmers should avoid entering the water today, as dangerous currents could pull even experienced swimmers offshore. Drivers should expect slowdowns on low-lying coastal roads and allow extra time for commutes. Officials caution against driving through barricades or water of unknown depth.\nBy Friday, skies will begin to clear, though a 20 percent chance of showers lingers. Winds from the northeast will remain breezy. Saturday and Sunday turn mostly sunny with highs near 80, giving eastern North Carolina a welcome window for outdoor plans, fall festivals, and even Halloween decorating.\nConditions stay warm and mostly dry into early next week, though another chance of showers returns Tuesday night.\nResidents are urged to monitor coastal water levels through tonight. The next advisory update will come if conditions worsen.\nFive Day Forecast for Morehead City, NC\n- Thursday: Partly sunny, high near 74. Coastal Flood Advisory until 8 p.m.\n- Friday: Slight chance of showers, high 75. Breezy northeast winds.\n- Saturday: Mostly sunny, high 79. Comfortable fall day.\n- Sunday: Partly sunny, high 80. Ideal for outdoor events.\n- Monday: Mostly sunny, high 81. Showers possible Tuesday night.",
