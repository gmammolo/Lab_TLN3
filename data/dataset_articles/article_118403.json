  "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – Fall weather in Florida brings a shift this weekend as sunshine gives way to storm chances on Saturday, October 4. Residents planning road trips, outdoor events, or home projects should prepare for afternoon thunderstorms and scattered showers that could slow traffic and dampen early October activities.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, skies stay clear through Friday with highs in the mid-80s. By Saturday afternoon, a 40% chance of showers and thunderstorms builds across Leon County, particularly along major routes such as U.S. Highway 90 and I-10. Drivers could face reduced visibility and slick conditions during peak afternoon travel hours.\nSaturday night holds a chance of lingering showers before storms expand on Sunday. Rain becomes more likely through Sunday afternoon and evening, with a 60% chance of thunderstorms that could disrupt weekend plans. Local emergency officials urge residents to secure Halloween decorations and yard items ahead of the storm window.\nWhile the weekend turns unsettled, Monday brings a return of sunshine with highs near 86 degrees. East winds remain steady through the stretch, keeping humidity levels seasonally manageable. Those preparing for Halloween displays or outdoor gatherings will find better conditions after the weekend system clears.\nMore showers are possible Tuesday, but long stretches of sunshine return midweek, reinforcing fall’s arrival across North Florida. Stay weather-aware and plan for potential disruptions this weekend before clear skies return.\nFive-Day Forecast for Tallahassee, FL\n- Thursday: Sunny, high near 85. East winds 10–15 mph.\n- Friday: Mostly sunny, high near 84. Evening clouds.\n- Saturday: 40% chance of showers and storms after 2 p.m. High near 85.\n- Sunday: Showers likely, 60% chance of storms by afternoon.
