  "text": "Charleston, S.C. – Large breaking waves and dangerous rip currents continue to threaten South Carolina beaches as the first week of October unfolds. A High Surf Advisory remains in effect until 8 a.m. Saturday, creating hazardous conditions for swimmers, surfers, and anyone venturing near the Atlantic.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Charleston, waves of five to six feet are expected along Charleston and Colleton County shores. A High Rip Current Risk stays in place through Thursday evening, with officials warning beachgoers that rip currents can sweep even experienced swimmers into deeper waters. Drivers heading across Highway 17 near Folly Beach should anticipate heavy surf spray and localized erosion in low-lying areas.\nLifeguards and emergency officials urge residents to avoid entering the surf. Instead, enjoy fall sunshine from the safety of the sand. The surf hazard will ease by Saturday morning, but conditions could shift again if winds strengthen over the weekend.\nAway from the beaches, inland Charleston will see breezy but pleasant weather. Temperatures climb into the upper 70s by Friday with partly sunny skies. Showers and thunderstorms increase Saturday evening, potentially bringing brief downpours across the metro and I-26 corridor.\nFor families beginning Halloween decorating, conditions improve Sunday into early next week with fewer storms and highs near 80.\nFive-Day Forecast for Charleston, SC:\n- Thursday: Sunny, high 77. Gusts up to 29 mph.\n- Friday: Mostly sunny, high 78. Chance of showers late.\n- Saturday: Showers and storms possible, high 79.\n- Sunday: Scattered storms, high near 80.\n- Monday: Partly cloudy, high 82.",
