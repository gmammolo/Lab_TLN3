  "text": "Houston’s run of steamy, late summer weather is far from over. We’re seeing a continued stretch of late summer heat in the low 90s.\nThe city is feeling the heat, and humidity is on the rise as we move toward the weekend.\nRain chances bump up just a bit—20 percent—for both Friday and Saturday, thanks to moisture sliding in from the east. That means a possible sprinkle or two late in the day, mainly around 5 or 6 p.m.\nTrack Today’s Forecast Here:\nNo description found Late Summer Heat Lingers: Thursday will be another sunny day with afternoon high temperatures in the mid-90s. In fact, we’ll be flirting with near record heat for the next few days!\nThursday's Forecast From the looks of it, we will see more days with temperatures in the mid to low 90s, stretching all the way through the work week and into the weekend.\nRELATED: When will the first “real” cold front arrive in Houston?\nIn other words, it’s not going to feel very October-like, because this is when we’ll usually have our first cool front for the month, but it is nowhere in sight.\nNext Three Days (Copyright 2025 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) Air Quality Concerns: Harris, Galveston and Brazoria counties are under an air quality alert. This is also called an ozone action day. Think of it as a poor air quality day. This means if you suffer from respiratory problems (such as asthma) you may want to consider exercising indoors, or limiting your time outside.\nTracking an air quality alert (Copyright 2025 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) Pollen Problems: We’re also watching an increase in fall allergies, so if you suffer from ragweed pollen, for example, the next few days could still be challenging, despite the beautiful weather outside.\nHouston's Pollen Forecast If you suffer from allergies or respiratory issues, poor air quality coupled with either condition could make symptoms worse.\nPoor AQ can make allergies worse (Copyright 2025 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) Fire Risk: As we move toward October, there might be a slight uptick in dew point temperatures as some coastal moisture builds in, leading to the chance of a few hit-and-miss showers late next week. For now, though, most days should remain dry with highs sitting in the upper 80s and low 90s, putting us at a higher fire risk.\nYour weather team is tracking fire danger thanks to the warmer weather and low humidity. (Copyright 2025 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.) Weekend Changes: As we round into the weekend forecast, we’ll start to see a little more humidity and a small chance for rain moves back in. Nothing too serious, however, a weak Gulf disturbance does look to bring in some more widespread rain chances on Sunday and Monday.\nMuggy meter on the rise and that could mean more coastal rain chances this weekend Tropical outlook: Watching a stalled boundary to potentially form a low pressure system over the coming days. It will continue to track NW into the Gulf where it will help increase rain chances. However, the best moisture maybe focused east of SE Texas.\nAn area of low pressure may form and push NW into the Gulf into the coming week Make sure your family is prepared for whatever comes our way this hurricane season. You can check out our 2025 Hurricane and Flood Survival Guide here.\nYour extended forecast: Mornings fall to the upper 60s through Monday morning. It will feel great with lower humidity, enjoy it because humidity starts to climb next weekend.\nSlim rain chances this weekend and early next week If you notice interesting weather in your neighborhood, share your photos and videos with KPRC 2 at Click2Pins !\nAnthony's Weather Lab Houston’s weather and other cool things explained by KPRC 2’s Chief Meteorologist Anthony Yanez",
