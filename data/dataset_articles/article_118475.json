  "text": "Get ready for some near record to record heat over the weekend, as temperatures soar to late July, early August levels.\nToday will be a transition day.\nWe'll see a nice mix of sun and clouds with afternoon temperatures in the mid to upper 70s, a bit cooler by the water.\nClouds will thin out overnight, with morning lows in the upper 40s to low 50s.\nExpect temperatures to surge Friday, with highs reaching the mid 80s.\nWe could be in record territory Saturday with mid to upper 80s.\nThe current record high in Flint is 88 degrees, set in 1951.\nSaginaw's record temperature is 87, set back in 1967.\nDry and sunny conditions continue into Sunday with afternoon highs in the mid 80s.\nBy Tuesday, a cold front will bring some rain and cooler upper 60s.",
