  "text": "The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has raised tropical cyclone wind signal no. 2 over parts of Isabela, Quirino, and Aurora on Thursday as tropical storm ‘Paolo’ intensified while over the Philippine Sea.\nIn an updated weather bulletin, PAGASA kept moving northwestward at 20 kilometers per hour (kph) and was last estimated at 575 km east of Infanta, Quezon. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 kph with gustiness of up to 90 kph.\nThe state weather bureau warned of “heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surge” over the affected localities outside its projected landfall points—which are either southern Isabela or northern Aurora by Friday morning—and the forecast confidence cone.\n“’Paolo’ will continue to intensify while over the Philippine Sea and may reach severe tropical storm category tonight. Further intensification into a typhoon prior to landfall is not ruled out,” PAGASA said.\nAt present, the following wind signals are observed in the affected Luzon provinces:\nSIGNAL NO. 2\n· The southeastern portion of Isabela (San Mariano, Dinapigue, San Guillermo, Echague, Jones, San Agustin, Benito Soliven, Angadanan, City of Cauayan, Naguilian), the northern portion of Quirino (Maddela), the northern portion of Aurora (Dilasag, Casiguran, Dinalungan)\nSIGNAL NO. 1\n· Cagayan, the rest of Isabela, the rest of Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Apayao, Abra, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Ifugao, Benguet, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, the northern portion of Zambales (Palauig, Masinloc, Candelaria, Santa Cruz), Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, the rest of Aurora, the northern portion of Bulacan (Doña Remedios Trinidad, San Miguel, San Ildefonso, Norzagaray, San Rafael), the northern portion of Pampanga (Magalang, Arayat, Candaba, Mabalacat City), the northern portion of Quezon (General Nakar, Infanta) including Polillo Islands, the northern portion of Camarines Norte (Capalonga, Jose Panganiban, Paracale, Vinzons, Talisay, Daet, Mercedes, Basud), the northern portion of Camarines Sur (Siruma, Tinambac, Lagonoy, Garchitorena, Caramoan), and the northern portion of Catanduanes (Pandan, Bagamanoc, Panganiban, Viga, Caramoran)\nThe storm is expected to leave the Philippine area of responsibility over the weekend.",
