  "text": "Jimmy Donaldson, popularly known as MrBeast in the Internet space and the entertainment world, has admitted that he has “negative money\" in his bank account. Yes, the same YouTuber who has 460 million subscribers on his main channel alone. Also, the same YouTuber who has given away an island worth Rs 5 crore, bought all cars in a dealership for strangers, sponsored 1,000 cataract surgeries, dug up 100 wells in Africa, tipped waiters thousands of dollars in cash, helped 2000 amputees walk again, ran dog adoption events, planted 20 million trees, donated handsome sum to streamers, and even opened a free money bank for strangers, among countless other grand gestures. The 27-year-old’s admission that he has less than zero in his bank account has been met with immense online ridicule and backlash from users on X. Around the summer of 2025, it was reported that the extravagant YouTuber had earned a rare title of becoming the 8th youngest billionaire in the world with a net worth of $1 billion. Also Read: ‘Kai Cenat Is Reading Slowly’: Why Fans Are Trolling (And Embracing) Livestreamer’s Journey Responding to the news of him turning a billionaire, the YouTuber, on X, wrote: “I personally have very little money because I reinvest everything (I think this year we’ll spend around a quarter of a billion on content). Ironically i’m actually borrowing $ from my mom to pay for my upcoming wedding lol. But sure, on paper the businesses I own are worth a lot.\" This was only months after he appeared on Diary of a CEO, a podcast hosted by Steven Bartlett. He had stated something similar. “Yeah. But in my actual bank account, I have less than one million. [I pay myself] a little bit, but I also have some assistants and things like that, so I try to pay myself what I spend personally, a month, just to stay even,\" the YouTuber had said. In a sit-down interview with YouTubers Colin and Samir a few years ago, Jimmy revealed his “simple\" yet sustainable model that helped him recover the losses he incurred in his high-production videos. He funnelled back the revenue he earned through his various “secondary\" YouTube channels into the business. In addition to this, he also runs several businesses, including Feastables, Lunchly, MrBeast Burger, and Beast Philanthropy, among several others. He has, time and again, spoken on numerous platforms about his first-ever brand deal sponsorship of $10,000 (approximately Rs 9 lakh) where he handed the entire amount to a homeless person on the streets and recorded the interaction for YouTube. In 2019, MrBeast shared that his life’s “main goal\" was to make as much money as possible and give it all away. “I know most people prob won’t believe this, but my main goal in life is to just make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible before I die. I just don’t want to live a meaningless life, I want to make an impact and be content when I’m older!\" he wrote on X (then known as Twitter). “Negative Money\" In January 2026, Jimmy aka MrBeast, once again touched on the topic that he barely has any bank balance. “No one ever believes anything I say because they’re like, ‘you’re a billionaire.’ I’m like, that’s net worth. Actually, I have negative money right now,\" he told Wall Street Journal . His most recent upload on YouTube titled “30 Celebrities Fight For $1,000,000!\" was a star-studded affair of contestants and hosts, which included the likes of Kevin Hart, Paris Hilton, Diplo, Steve-O, Giada De Laurentiis, among others. He, speaking to the news daily, claimed that he was “borrowing money\" to keep the lights on his multi-million dollar empire. “I’m borrowing money, that’s how little money I have. Technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me in their bank account if you subtract the equity value of my company, which doesn’t buy me McDonald’s in the morning or whatever.\" Unlike the previous instances where the billionaire had revealed that he pumps back his earnings into his business, users on X have found it difficult to digest the fact that the billionaire and YouTube mogul would have a “negative\" bank account. That it was a tone-deaf statement was the general sentiment among users. “Lmao this is literally how rich ppl stay rich, avoid a salary claim no money pay no taxes it’s all assets (sic),\" responded one to Dexerto’s report. “He just wants family and friends to stop asking him for money. We know this playbook,\" jibed another. Piercing reactions kept flooding X. Financial Audit show host Caleb Hammer, popular for his blunt financial advice to everyday folks struggling to stay afloat, joined the bandwagon. “Borrowing money against your net worth is the #1 trick all billionaires do to avoid taxes,\" remarked one.",
