Ratings are based on six categories: affordability, weather, safety, economy, education and health, and quality of life. The cities ranged in population from 10,000 to 150,000, but they had to have at least one local beach listed on TripAdvisor. Read the\nfull methodology here. From those rankings, we selected the top 50. Readers who live in California and Florida will be unsurprised to learn that many of towns featured here are in one of those two states.\nGallery Credit: Keri Wiginton\nNew Jersey's best tourist town for all 4 seasons\nGallery Credit: Dennis Malloy",
