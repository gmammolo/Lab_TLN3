  "text": "Australian coal and copper producers have continued to face weather-related challenges in Queensland, including transport closures in the mineral-rich state.\nRoad and rail disruptions have limited global producer Glencore's ability to supply copper concentrate to its smelter for multiple days. These disruptions are ongoing, a spokesperson told Argus today.\nParts of the Mount Isa rail line — which supports Glencore and other metal and fertilizer producers — remain closed because of weeks of rainfall, Australian rail operator Queensland Rail said on 14 January. The operator is meeting regularly with freight operators to support load management, it added.\nQueensland Rail is unable to confirm a timeline for the resumption of operations at the Mount Isa line, Queensland Rail's head of regional Scott Cornish said.\nGlencore is also facing disruptions at its Hails Creek and Collinsville mixed thermal and coking coal mines, and its Clermont thermal coal mine.\nAustralian producer Pembroke Resources is also facing weather-related disruptions. The firm declared force majeure on some coal shipments on 15 January because recent weather events have stopped it from mining, according to market sources.\nAustralian coal producers M Resources and Stanmore and Swiss-based AMCI also declared force majeure on Queensland shipments earlier this week because of supply chain disruptions.\nSome Queensland coal operators have been less impacted by the wet weather. The BHP Mitsubishi Alliance's mines in the state are operating and it has wet weather plans in place, a BHP spokesperson told Argus on 15 January.\nThe Central Queensland Coal Network — which links coal mines in the state to export ports — is also open and operational with some minor isolated restrictions in place, Australian rail operator Aurizon told Argus.\nArgus' metallurgical coal premium hard low-volatile fob Australia price has increased over the past week because of the weather events in Queensland. It was last assessed at $232.95/t on 14 January, up from $218.75/t on 7 January.",
