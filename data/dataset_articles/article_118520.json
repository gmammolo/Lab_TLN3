  "text": "A low-pressure system, which intensified into a deep depression over the west-central Bay of Bengal, is moving steadily towards the Odisha-Andhra coast, raising the likelihood of heavy to very heavy rainfall across large parts of coastal Odisha over the next three days.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the system, currently centred about 300 km south-southeast of Gopalpur and an equal distance south of Puri, is advancing northwestwards at a speed of around 10 kmph.\nThe weather office has forecast that the deep depression is likely to cross the coast between Paradip and Gopalpur, close to the Odisha-Andhra border, between midnight today and tomorrow morning.\nHeavy Rainfall Warning For Coastal Districts\nUnder its influence, widespread rainfall activity is expected over coastal Odisha, including Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, during the festive period of Dussehra. The IMD has cautioned that the downpour may disrupt traditional celebrations, including Ravan Dahan events.\nThe weather department also issued a red warning for extremely heavy rainfall for Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts. In addition, 14 districts have been placed under orange and yellow alerts, signalling the risk of heavy to very heavy showers.\nALSO READ: Odisha on alert as IMD forecasts heavy rainfall till October 5\nWeather Disruptions To Continue\nFor tomorrow, three districts remain under orange alert while nine are under yellow warning, with the weather office advising residents to prepare for intense rain and possible waterlogging.\nThe IMD has also cautioned fishermen against venturing into the sea until October 3, warning of rough conditions in the Bay of Bengal. Coastal areas are likely to witness squally winds and turbulent seas during the period.\nALSO READ: Durga Puja 2025: OTV’s ‘Ama Sahi Medha’, an initiative to preserve cultural grandeur & innovation\nMeanwhile, the IMD’s Regional Meteorological Centre in Bhubaneswar has warned of gusty surface winds between 30-50 kmph for almost all the districts of the state.",
