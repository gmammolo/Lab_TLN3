  "text": "- logo-icon\n- close-icon\nStorm Amy is barrelling towards the entire island of Ireland, triggering severe weather warnings across multiple counties. Several counties face orange-level warnings, while yellow-level alerts will affect all counties at various points during Thursday and Friday.\nMet Eireann meteorologist Ailis Hankinson said Storm Amy will bring wet and very windy conditions on Friday, preceded by a band of heavy rain on Thursday. She said: \"It is the first storm of the season so it's essential to be prepared for potential impacts caused by the strong winds and the rain.\"\nThe meteorologist warned of significant risks from the autumn timing. \"There could be difficult travelling conditions, loose objects or flying debris. Trees are still in leaf at this time of the year, so there could be higher impacts from fallen trees and leaves blocking drains, causing localised flooding,\" she said.\nA Status Yellow rain warning covers all of Connacht and Munster, plus Donegal, Cavan and Longford between 6am and 8pm on Thursday. Kerry faces the most severe conditions under a Status Orange rain warning during the same timeframe, with flooding and very difficult travelling conditions expected.\nSignificant flooding risks extend across the southwest, particularly in mountainous areas of west Cork and west Limerick due to heavy Thursday rainfall. Additional rainfall forecast for Friday will further increase river levels, compounding the threat.\nA Status Yellow thunderstorm warning remains active for Connacht until 2pm, carrying risks of possible lightning damage. Hankinson added: \"Small, upland river catchments are the most at risk of flooding, so precautions for potential localised flooding in these areas are also important.\"\nA Status Yellow wind warning will affect the entire Republic of Ireland between midday and midnight on Friday. Met Eireann warns of potential impacts including fallen trees, flying debris and difficult travelling conditions.\nFive counties face more severe Status Orange wind warnings, with Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo warned of possible wave overtopping and power outages. Gale force winds are expected in the northwest regions.\nThe most extreme Status Red Storm warning covers the coast from Loop Head to Rossan Point to Fair Head between 2pm and 8pm on Friday.\nNorthern Ireland faces a Yellow wind warning across the entire region from 4pm Friday to 6am Saturday. The UK Met Office expects Storm Amy to bring strong westerly winds, peaking during Friday evening with gusts of 50 to 60 mph across many areas.\nExposed coasts and hills could experience gusts exceeding 70mph. The Met Office warns of potential building damage, transport delays, and power cuts affecting mobile phone coverage.\nThere remains a small chance of injuries and danger to life from large waves and flying debris along coastal areas.\nSources used: \"Met Eireann\", \"UK Met Office\" Note: This article has been edited with the help of Artificial Intelligence.",
