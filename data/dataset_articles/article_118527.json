  "text": "Major UK storm to hit northern France this weekend\nGales of 110km/h along French coast are likely\nA major Atlantic storm set to hit the British Isles is expected to also impact the north of France.\nDubbed Storm Amy by the UK Met Office (previously known as ex-hurricance Humberto), it is set to bring gales of up to 170 km/h to the UK and Ireland before heading into the North Sea, where waves up to 12 metres high are expected.\nIt will also bring heavy rain, particularly across Scotland.\nIt will hit overnight between Friday and Saturday (October 3 and 4) continuing to impact the Isles, especially in Scotland, over the weekend.\n— Met Office (@metoffice)\n[#StormAmy]has been named and is forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rain to the UK later on Friday and into Saturday[#WeatherAware][pic.twitter.com/x5RCePczbV][October 1, 2025]\nLower impact in France\nThe initial forecast for the storm saw it crossing through Ireland and southern Scotland, bringing the brunt of its impact to these areas as well as the north of England.\nHowever, updated models predict the storm moving more northwards, directly through Scotland and the North Sea.\nIn turn, this reduces the likely impact of the storm in France.\nWinds pushing through England and the English Channel will still reach northern France however, stretching from Brittany to Calais.\nCoastal areas may see winds of up to 110 km/h in Brittany, and around 100 km/h along the Hauts-de-France coastline, with gales out at sea reaching 130 km/h.\nInland, winds of 80 km/h are possible, with the storm potentially reaching the German border.\nCurrently, state forecaster Météo France has not given any weather alerts for France based on Storm Amy, saying there is “a low risk of dangerous weather conditions,” for the continent.\nHowever, Météo France only provides alerts one day in advance, meaning it is necessary to wait until Friday morning to see if any warnings are in place for Saturday.",
