  "text": "By Justin Ballard ,\n1 hours ago This image shows the odds of 90-degree heat across Texas on Thursday. Houston, San Antonio, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex are all expected to see highs at or above 90 degrees as the warm start to October continues. (WeatherBELL) With no rain and lingering summer heat , ragweed pollen is thriving, and so are allergy symptoms across Houston.\nThe only relief Mother Nature may offer over the next seven to 10 days will be spotty showers. None of us should get our hopes too high for much-needed allergy relief in the form of cleansing rains. Here’s what areas of Southeast Texas stand the best chance at a few late-week showers.\nShowers possible, mainly south First, let’s talk about the slim rain chances that slip into the Houston metro area late this week because that’s the most intriguing part of the forecast.\nAIR QUALITY: This week’s hot and dry weather could result in unhealthy levels of ozone pollution. Track Houston’s air quality.\nA plume of tropical moisture is expected to roll into Southeast Texas from the northern Gulf of Mexico by Friday. As moisture levels increase, the dry heat of late will be replaced with more of a muggy, August-like heat. That increased moisture will lead to a few hit-or-miss showers by Thursday evening along the coast. While a rogue shower may try to sneak into Houston, most of us more than ten miles inland are going to stay high and dry Thursday.\nThe High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model’s depiction of future weather radar at 8 p.m. Thursday shows an isolated shower or storm is possible, mainly south and east of Houston. (Pivotal Weather) Sea and bay breeze storms may redevelop by Friday afternoon, with rain chances peaking near 20% and stretching farther inland. Whether you’re reading this forecast in Houston, Friendswood, or Conroe, you’ve got a small chance at seeing a brief passing downpour .\nAnother moisture-rich air mass is expected to move into the region early next week and could provide us with perhaps a few more spotty downpours.\nCould isolated storms provide allergy relief? Frankly, even if your area lucked out and saw downpours Thursday and Friday, it likely wouldn’t rain long enough or hard enough to completely remove ragweed pollen from the air.\nCalendar of allergens (ARC Allergy & Asthma) That said, the few passing storms that do develop may help provide some relief if you are contending with itchy or watery eyes and sore throats. If this describes you, don’t quit whatever you may be doing to manage your allergy symptoms.\nWhat Houston needs is the kind of soaking rains that you’d hope would enter the picture this time of year. Pollen levels typically only drop after widespread, soaking rains that wash allergens from the air.\nHURRICANE SEASON LATEST: Here’s why October in Texas likely closes the window for hurricane season for Houston.\nUnfortunately, no evidence in long-range forecast guidance suggests that kind of rainy day is in our future anytime soon.\nHouston can’t shake the 90s Is there any chance at highs not consistently in the 90s? Not yet.\nEach day this week , this weekend, and early next week looks to bring high temperatures at least to 90 degrees. While the warmest weather is likely to subside beyond Thursday’s forecast high of 95 degrees, lower 90s are still above normal for early October.\n{ \"__type\": \"devHubFreeformEmbed\", \"__id\": \"Datawrapper\", \"__fallbackImage\": \"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NBhM5/mobile.png\", \"__data\": { \"datawrapper_id\": \"NBhM5\" } } Morning temperatures also increase thanks to the return of Houston’s characteristically muggy air mass. By early next week, Houston’s lows may not drop much below 75 degrees.\nIt does look like temperatures may finally stop reaching 90 degrees by the middle of October, but this has more to do with the continued loss of daylight and the fall sun angle than any appreciable cooler air mass.\nUntil then, Houstonians may be stuck with heat, humidity, and ragweed — a stubborn mix that makes October feel more like August.\nSign up for Houston Chronicle newsletters here\nRead the original article on houstonchronicle.com",
