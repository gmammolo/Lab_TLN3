  "text": "Heavy rain continued to batter Odisha on Thursday as a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal advanced towards the coast, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue multiple alerts across the state.\nThe system, moving north-northwest at 13 kmph, is expected to cross the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh coast between Gopalpur and Paradip by Thursday night, informed the IMD.\nManorama Mohanty, Director of the Regional Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar, said the IMD has issued a red alert for Puri, Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Kalahandi, and Kandhamal, where rainfall is expected to exceed 20 cm till Friday morning.\n“The depression lies centred about 160 km south-southeast of Gopalpur, 200 km south of Puri, and 280 km south-southwest of Paradip. Under its influence, all Odisha districts are forecast to receive heavy to moderate rainfall along with wind gusts reaching 50 to 60 kmph,” said Mohanty.\nSeven Districts Under Red Alert\nThe IMD has issued a red alert for Puri, Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput, Kalahandi, and Kandhamal, where rainfall exceeding 20 cm is likely at isolated places till Friday morning.\nIn addition, 16 districts, including Khurda, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Kendrapara, Angul, Dhenkanal, Nayagarh, and Bolangir, have been placed under orange warning for heavy to very heavy showers in the range of 7 to 20 cm.\nAnother seven districts in western Odisha are under a yellow alert, with forecast rainfall of 7 to 11 cm.\nALSO READ: 7 out of 193 puja committees get Ravan Dahan permission in Bhubaneswar; rain fails to dampen festivities\nSqually Winds and Port Warnings\nThe depression is also expected to generate squally winds reaching 55–65 kmph, gusting to 75 kmph over central and adjoining north Bay of Bengal.\nAs a precaution, the IMD has advised fishermen not to venture into the sea along and off the Odisha coast till October 3.
