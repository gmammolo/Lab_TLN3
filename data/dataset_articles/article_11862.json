  "text": "Joe Keshi, Nigeria’s former permanent secretary and minister of foreign affairs, has cautioned that the United States (US) is specifically targeting the flow of global remittances, with its latest crackdown banning 75 countries including Nigeria from obtaining immigrant visas.\nSpeaking in an interview with Channels TV, he warned that Nigeria must develop a systematic strategy to engage Washington, calling on Nigeria’s federal government to urgently “reflect and understand” the motivations behind the crackdown.\nThe veteran diplomat highlighted the potential for a domestic economic crisis if these financial pipelines are constricted.\n“If we annually receive over $24 billion from Nigerians abroad and remittances are targeted, that is a staggering sum Nigeria stands to lose,” Keshi remarked.\nHe further warned that many Nigerian families reliant on these funds could “fall below the poverty line” should the flow of capital be disrupted by the new policies by the United States (US).\nAccording to him, there’s a need for proper coordination to find out what Trump has against Nigeria. “A couple of days ago, he said that 30 percent of Nigerians are living off the state which is untrue. Many Nigerians in the US are hardworking and have two to three jobs”, he said.\nThe move is expected to affect travel, migration and international relations.\nA crackdown on ‘public charges’\nThe ambassador’s warnings come as the US Department of State announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals from 75 countries including Nigeria.\nThe move represents a significant escalation in President Donald Trump’s efforts to restrict legal pathways into the US since his return to office.\nThe State Department justified the measures on Wednesday, framing the policy as a necessary step to “end the abuse” of the American system.\nOfficials argued that the restrictions are designed to prevent foreign nationals from “extracting wealth” through the use of welfare and public benefits.\nScope of the new restrictions\nWhile the full list of the 75 affected nations remains classified, the order is scheduled to take effect on January 21. Key details of the policy include:\nPublic charge rule: Potential immigrants deemed likely to become a “public charge” will be ruled ineligible.\nRead also: Nigeria accounts for over 60% of FIDs in Africa – Lokpobiri\nProcedural reassessment: Marco Rubio, US secretary of state has ordered a pause to reassess vetting procedures to prevent “exploitation” of the US social safety net.\nSelective suspension: The freeze applies specifically to immigrant visas. Non-immigrant categories, including temporary tourist and business visas currently remain unaffected.\nExisting bans: This new measure builds upon previous restrictions already placed on citizens from Brazil, Iran, Russia, Somalia, and Afghanistan.\nNational security and economic fallout\nThe administration’s shift toward more aggressive vetting follows a security incident in November involving an Afghan national in Washington, DC. In the aftermath, the White House banned or restricted entry for nationals from 19 countries, a list that has since expanded to include 24 nations and holders of Palestinian Authority documents.\nThe implications for these nations are severe; not only are new visas on hold, but asylum cases, citizenship processing, and green card applications have also been frozen for the countries initially targeted.\nFor Nigeria, the concern remains primarily economic. As the Trump administration moves to “protect the generosity of the American people,” the resulting friction may significantly diminish the billions of dollars in private capital sent back each year.\nJoin BusinessDay whatsapp Channel, to stay up to date\nOpen In Whatsapp",
