Strong spells of wind are also expected.\nThe warning covers much of the west coast of Scotland, impacting Perth and Kinross, Stirling, the Highlands, Western Isles, Argyll and Bute, Inverclyde, North Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire.\nThere is a risk of landslides across the country during the warning.\nSEPA has issued red flood warnings for Kilbirnie and Glengarnock, Dalry and Kilwinning. Amber flood alerts in Skye and Lochaber, Argyll and Bute, Ayrshire and Arran and Wester Ross, are also in place.\nThe public has been warned to expect delays to public transport, spray and flooding on roads, as well as potential power cuts and flooding in homes and businesses.\nSome communities may be cut off by flooded roads, and there is a chance that fast-flowing or deep floodwater could result in a danger to life, the Met Office added.\nInsight Sean Batty STV News Meterologist\nIt’s looked likely since the start of the week that this system would become a named storm, but forecasters needed greater agreement between computer models before confirming a deep low would form. While there’s still some uncertainty over the exact track, the latest guidance suggests Storm Amy is set to track across the far north of the country — putting much of Scotland at risk of damaging winds from Friday night into Saturday.\nIf the current forecast holds, we could see gusts of 60–70 mph even in more populated areas of the mainland, with exposed parts of the northwest potentially experiencing gusts nearing 90 mph.\nAmy will also bring more rainfall to areas already expecting heavy rain in the coming days, particularly in the west. This raises the risk of further flooding, with cumulative totals from Wednesday to Saturday possibly exceeding 100mm in parts of the western Highlands — equivalent to two to three weeks’ worth of rain in just a few days.\nIn addition, Amy is likely to trigger the first significant leaf fall of the season. This could lead to blocked drains and exacerbate surface water flooding in some locations.\nFollow STV News on WhatsApp\nScan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",
