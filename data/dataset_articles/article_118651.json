  "text": "LATEST | Storm Amy: Heavy rain forecast for Cork – Road users urged to exercise caution\nMotorists have been urged to drive with care over the coming days as heavy rain and strong winds are forecast.\nMet Éireann has named the first storm of the season and issued a Status Yellow wind warning along with a Status Yellow rain warning for 14 counties including Cork.\nThe wind warning, covering the whole country, will come into effect at 12pm on Friday, October 3 and be valid until midnight on Saturday.\nStorm Amy will bring strong to near gale force and gusty south-westerly winds.\nThe storm will sweep past Ireland's north west coast over Friday bringing potentially powerful winds and torrential rainfall.\nMeteorologists are carefully tracking the path of the former hurricane which is now expected to track much closer to Ireland than initially expected.\nCork County Council is asking road users to exercise caution over the coming days as driving conditions may be hazardous, with surface water flooding possible.\nMotorists are advised to avoid driving through flowing or standing water and to exercise caution during heavy rain.\nMotorists are also asked to be conscious of cyclists and pedestrians.\nStrong to near gale force winds and gusty south-westerly winds are forecast until midnight on Friday, October 3.\nThe potential impacts include difficult travelling conditions, debris, loose objects displaced and some fallen trees possible.\nStrong winds can make driving conditions hazardous, especially for the more vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists and high sided vehicles.\nRoad users are urged to pay particular attention to the risk posed by fallen trees and flying debris.\nForecasted conditions may give rise to localised power outages.\nA spokesperson for Cork County Council said that in the event of disruption to power supply, people are advised to contact ESB Networks at 1800 372 999.\nIn the event of disruption to water supply, people are urged to contact Uisce Éireann at 1800 278 278.\nIssues such as flooding and road damage can be reported to Cork County Council’s emergency number 021 4800048 which will remain open until 9am on Friday morning, October 3.\nOn Friday, October 3 issues can be reported to your local Council Office during working hours (9am to 5pm), details of which can be found by visiting www.corkcoco.ie.\nPeople are advised to call 999 or 112 and request the fire service, ambulance service, gardaí or Irish Coastguard as appropriate.\nWeather updates are available at www.met.ie\nCork County Council will continue to monitor the situation and updates will be available on www.corkcoco.ie and across the Council’s social media channels.",
