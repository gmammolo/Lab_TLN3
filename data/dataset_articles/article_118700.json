  "text": "On Thursday at 1:29 a.m. the National Weather Service issued a dense fog advisory in effect until 9 a.m. for Southern Centre and Bedford County.\n\"Visibility one quarter mile or less in dense fog,\" can be expected according to the weather service. \"A light glaze of ice, especially on bridges and overpasses could also contribute to the hazardous driving conditions.\"\n\"Low visibility could make driving conditions hazardous,\" describes the weather service. \"If driving, slow down, use your low-beam headlights, and leave plenty of distance ahead of you.\"\nFog safety: Tips from the weather service for safe travels If a dense fog advisory is issued for your area, it means that widespread dense fog has developed and visibility often drops to just a quarter-mile or less. These conditions can make driving challenging, so exercise extreme caution on the road, and if possible, consider delaying your trip.\nIf driving in fog becomes unavoidable, remember these safety tips:\nReduce speed:\nSlow down and allocate extra time for your trip to reach your destination safely.\nVisibility matters:\nEnsure your vehicle is visible to others by using low-beam headlights, which also activate your taillights. If you have fog lights, use them.\nAvoid high-beams:\nRefrain from using high-beam headlights, as they create glare that impairs your visibility on the road.\nKeep a safe distance:\nLeave a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front of you to account for sudden stops or changes in the traffic pattern.\nStay in your lane:\nUse the road's lane markings as a guide to remaining in the correct lane.\nVisibility near zero:\nIn situations of near-zero visibility due to dense fog, activate your hazard lights and seek a secure location, such as a nearby business's parking lot, to pull over and come to a stop.\nLimited parking options:\nIf no designated parking area is available, pull your vehicle as far off the road as possible. Once stationary, deactivate all lights except the hazard flashers, engage the emergency brake, and release the brake pedal to ensure your tail lights are not illuminated, reducing the risk of other drivers colliding with your stationary vehicle.\nBy adhering to these recommendations from the weather service, you can navigate foggy conditions with greater safety, mitigating the risk of accidents and prioritizing your well-being.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
