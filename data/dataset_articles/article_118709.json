  "text": "Areas across the UK, stretching from London to the Shetland Islands, experienced snowfall on Wednesday, prompting numerous school closures in north-east Scotland and the Highlands. The inclement weather also led to significant road disruptions, with closures reported on the Woodhead Pass between Hollingworth and Flouch in Derbyshire, as well as the B4391 route connecting Rhyd y Sarn and Pen y Bryn in north-west Wales.\nAs temperatures are expected to plummet overnight, forecasts indicate lows of -5C (23F) in parts of Scotland and northern England, while other regions of England and east Wales may experience temperatures dipping to -3C (26.6F). With frost on the horizon, there are concerns about potential ice formation on damp surfaces left by recent rain and sleet, creating hazards on roads and pavements. Authorities are advising caution, as the adverse weather may result in delays or cancellations for bus and train services.\nHowever, meteorologists have reassured the public that the current conditions are unlikely to mirror the severe winter experienced last year, which saw significant school closures and snow accumulation of 12cm in Nottingham. Over the past several decades, the Met Office has noted a marked decrease in the frequency, duration, and intensity of cold spells, correlating closely with the impacts of climate change. The latest State of the Climate Report reveals that instances of air and ground frosts have diminished by approximately 25% since the 1980s, signifying a notable shift in weather patterns across the nation.",
