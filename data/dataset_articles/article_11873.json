  "title": "Cyber Fraudsters Defraud Woman Entrepreneur of ₹1.80 Crore, Funds Routed Through 1,800 Accounts",
  "text": "Kanpur: Cyber criminals defrauded a woman entrepreneur from Indira Nagar, Kalyanpur, of ₹1.80 crore, which was dispersed across 1,800 separate bank accounts. Tracking the stolen funds has become a complex task for the cybercrime division, as the money was routed through 10 to 12 layers to obscure its trail.\nHow the Fraud Unfolded\nFour months ago, the entrepreneur received a message on her social media account promoting a share trading investment opportunity, promising substantial returns. Initially, she engaged in a dialogue through the messaging platform, but the fraudsters subsequently sent a mobile link and added her to a group. Within the group, other participants’ messages reinforced the illusion of profitable trading and visible dividend gains.\nFalling for the ruse, the woman invested a total of ₹1.80 crore over three to four months. In December 2025, when she attempted to withdraw the profits from her account, the transaction could not be completed. The fraudsters then demanded an additional 40 percent of the amount to release the funds. It was at this stage that she realised she had been defrauded and reported the case to the cybercrime division.\nCertified Cyber Crime Investigator Course Launched by Centre for Police Technology\nFunds Spread Across 1,800 Accounts\nInvestigations revealed that the stolen money was dispersed across nearly 1,800 bank accounts nationwide. The money was transferred through multiple layers to make tracing difficult.\nExperts explain that the first layer comprises the accounts that initially received the money. From there, the amount in each account is split into 10 or more accounts, constituting the second layer. In the third layer, the funds from each of these accounts are again distributed into 10 separate accounts each. With every successive layer, the number of accounts multiplies rapidly, making tracking and identifying the funds increasingly challenging.\nRole of the Cybercrime Information System\nThe investigation also highlighted the function of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (IC4), where information regarding cyber fraud is processed. Accounts that receive defrauded funds are identified, and banks are notified to freeze these accounts. In this case, all 1,800 accounts involved in the transactions were frozen to prevent further misuse.\nSource and Link\nInvestigators determined that the call to the entrepreneur originated from a VPN based in Cambodia. The fraudsters created a complex network, distributing the funds across multiple layers, which significantly complicated efforts to trace the ultimate destination of the money.\nChallenges for the Cyber Cell\nTracking funds distributed across such an extensive and layered network is highly challenging. Each account must be audited, transfers mapped across layers, and recovery operations coordinated on a large scale. The complexity of the scheme highlights the evolving sophistication of cyber fraud in India.\nPublic Advisory\nAuthorities have urged the public to exercise caution and avoid being lured by investment or share trading schemes promising high returns. Investments should only be made through legitimate platforms and verified services. Messages and links received via mobile or social media should not be trusted without due verification.\nExperts also warn that future cyber frauds are likely to become even more complex, emphasising the need for ongoing awareness, monitoring of fraudulent patterns, and understanding of layered fund transfers.",
