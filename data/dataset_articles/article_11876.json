  "text": "Indian airlines, including Air India, SpiceJet and IndiGo, are experiencing international flight disruptions due to Iran's airspace closure amid heightened tensions with the United States.Indian airlines are facing disruptions in international flight operations due to airspace closure in Iran. Air India, IndiGo and SpiceJet have issued travel advisories, warning passengers of flight delays and cancellations. The Iranian government announced an airspace shutdown early on Thursday which is expected to last for four hours as Tehran's tensions with the United States remain high. Air India said that its flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays. The airline has also cancelled several flights where rerouting was not possible.\\\"Due to the emerging situation in Iran, the subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of the safety of our passengers, Air India flights overflying the region are now using an alternative routing, which may lead to delays,\\\" Some Air India flights where currently rerouting is not possible are being cancelled,\\\" it said.IndiGo said that some of its international flights are impacted due to the sudden airspace closure by Iran. The airline is assessing the situation and supporting affected customers by offering the best possible alternatives. \\\"This development is beyond our control, and we regret the disruption it may have caused to your travel plans,\\\" it said.SpiceJet advised its passengers to check flight status as some flights may be impacted due to airspace closure in Iran.Iran airspace closureThe closure is expected to run for over four hours, according to pilot guidance issued by Iran, which lies on a key East-West flight route. Several International carriers diverted north and south around Iran. The closure immediately rippled through the global aviation industry because Iran is located on a key East-West route for airlines.“Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” Reuters reported, citing the website SafeAirspace, which provides information on conflict areas and air travel. “The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defense, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”Iran's airspace closure came as the United States advised some personnel at a key U.S. military base in Qatar to evacuate. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait also ordered its personnel to “temporary halt” going to the multiple military bases in the small Gulf Arab country.International airlines impactedLufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week. The measure is undertaken as the airlines wants to avoid crew's overnight stay. Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement.Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, also said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week.MEA urges Indians in Iran to evacuateThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued an advisory for Indians in Iran, urging them to leave the country by available means, including commercial flights, amid an evolving security situation. The advisory, issued on Wednesday, followed an earlier travel caution issued on January 5, 2026 and comes as protests and unrest continue in parts of Iran.India reiterated that all its citizens and Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs) should exercise due caution, avoid areas of protests or demonstrations, and stay in contact with the Indian Embassy in Tehran. The ministry has also advised them to monitor local media and ensure that their travel and immigration documents, including passports and IDs, are readily available.",
