  "text": "1 hours ago On November 18, 2025, a rescue took place in Cordes Lakes, Arizona, after a vehicle was swept away by flash floodwaters on Big Bug Creek. At about 3:00 PM, local residents saw a sedan carried by the current near E. Fremont Drive and Thunderbird Trail. Two men were seen holding onto the trunk.\nYavapai County Sheriff’s Office (YCSO) deputies arrived soon after. One deputy entered the water and pulled one man to safety. The rescued man said he had tried to help the elderly driver, who was last seen as the car moved further downstream.\nThe search for the missing 70-year-old driver continued. YCSO used K9 units, backcountry teams, 4x4 vehicles, and drones. Air support was available but could not be used due to bad weather.\nThe vehicle was found against a tree about two miles from where it entered the creek, but it was empty. Family members said the missing man left home around 3:00 PM and did not reach his destination. Search and Rescue teams, along with fire and rescue personnel, have checked both banks of Big Bug Creek and the Agua Fria River. Their efforts are ongoing.\nAuthorities are asking the public to avoid the area because of dangerous water conditions. They also advise caution throughout Yavapai County during this week’s weather. The search for the missing driver continues as of November 19, 2025.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
