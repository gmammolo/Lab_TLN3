Heavy across north-east England in particular.\nA Met Office map -Credit:PA Graphics/Press Association Images \"The highest snowfall totals from Wednesday night through Thursday will likely be across the Sperrins, North Yorkshire Moors, Northwest Highlands, Grampians and upland Pembrokeshire.\"\nThe national weather service warned that rural communities could become cut off in the amber warning area as gusty winds hit, creating \"occasional blizzard conditions\", with the possibility of lightning adding to the hazards.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Motorists faced challenging conditions across the North East on Wednesday night, with North Yorkshire Police advising drivers to avoid the A171 near Whitby where several vehicles became stuck due to the snow.\nOfficers also closed the A169 between Whitby and Pickering amid heavy snowfall.\nShaun Jones, AA Expert Patrol, said: \"When snow and ice hit, the roads can quickly become treacherous. Stopping distances can increase tenfold on icy surfaces, so slowing down and leaving plenty of space is absolutely vital.\n\"Drivers should plan ahead, stick to main routes and allow extra time for their journey.\"\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Wintry downpours are set to strike East Anglia, western Wales and Cornwall through the night, whilst continuing snowfall across the North East may lead to \"substantial disruption\", the Met Office warned.\nAround five yellow alerts for snow and ice remain active nationwide on Thursday, with warnings covering the north-east England coastline, Cornwall, Devon and western Wales lasting until 11.59pm.\nNational Rail has advised passengers to verify their travel plans before setting off during the icy and snowy conditions.\nThe operator explained that speed limits may be imposed on trains for safety reasons, potentially leading to service cancellations, changes and delays.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Frigid Arctic conditions continue to grip the nation, with overnight temperatures plummeting to -6C at Spadeadam in Cumbria.\nHowever, even chillier conditions may lie ahead, the Met Office cautioned, with possible lows of -12C in snow-covered regions of Scotland on Friday.\nThe mercury will start climbing back towards seasonal norms over the weekend as damper and breezier conditions move in, though it won't match the \"exceptionally mild\" weather experienced earlier this November, forecasters noted.\nAdvertisement About our ads",
