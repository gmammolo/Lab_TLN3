  "text": "At 1:53 a.m. on Thursday, the National Weather Service released a dense fog advisory in effect until 9 a.m. for Northern Clinton, Northern Lycoming, Southern Clinton and Southern Lycoming as well as Huntingdon, Mifflin, Juniata, Fulton, Union, Snyder, Montour, Northumberland and Perry counties.\n\"Visibility one quarter mile or less in dense fog,\" can be anticipated according to the weather service. \"A light glaze of ice, especially on bridges and overpasses could contribute to the hazardous driving conditions.\"\n\"Low visibility could make driving conditions hazardous,\" describes the weather service. \"If driving, slow down, use your low-beam headlights, and leave plenty of distance ahead of you.\"\nGuidance from the weather service for navigating foggy conditions\nIf a dense fog advisory is issued for your area, it means that widespread dense fog has developed and visibility often drops to just a quarter-mile or less. These conditions can make driving challenging, so exercise extreme caution on the road, and if possible, consider delaying your trip.\nIf you must drive in foggy conditions, keep the following safety tips in mind:\nReduce speed:\nSlow down and allocate extra travel time to reach your destination safely.\nVisibility matters:\nEnsure your vehicle is visible to others by using low-beam headlights, which also activate your taillights. If available, employ your fog lights.\nAvoid high-beams:\nRefrain from using high-beam lights, as they create glare, making it more difficult for you to see what’s ahead of you on the road.\nKeep your distance:\nMaintain a significant following distance to account for abrupt stops or shifts in traffic patterns.\nStay in your lane:\nTo ensure you are staying in the correct lane, use the road's lane markings as a guide.\nZero visibility strategy:\nIn situations of near-zero visibility due to dense fog, activate your hazard lights and seek a secure location, such as a nearby business's parking lot, to pull over and come to a stop.\nLimited parking options:\nIf there is no parking lot or driveway to pull into, pull your vehicle off to the side of the road as far as possible. Once you come to a stop, turn off all lights except your hazard flashing lights, set the emergency brake, and take your foot off of the brake pedal to be sure the tail lights are not illuminated so that other drivers don't mistakenly run into you.\nBy adhering to these recommendations from the weather service, you can navigate foggy conditions more safely, reducing the risk of accidents and ensuring your well-being.",
