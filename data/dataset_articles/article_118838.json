  "text": "States » WestPosted at: Nov 20 2025 1:24AM Cold wave likely in Maharashtra as temperatures dip further: IMDPune, Nov 19 (UNI) Cold winds blowing from North India are expected to bring a further drop in temperatures across Maharashtra, with some regions likely to experience cold wave–like conditions, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned today. This year, Maharashtra witnessed prolonged and intense rainfall. Now, winter chill has increased across most parts of the state. Even Mumbai is experiencing noticeably cooler nights and early mornings. According to IMD, temperatures may dip even further in the coming days, especially in North Maharashtra and Vidarbha, where cold wave conditions are likely to develop. At present, several districts such as Nashik and Jalgaon in North Maharashtra and Gondia in Vidarbha are already experiencing severe cold and dense fog. In many cities across the state, temperatures have dropped below 10°C. A stark contrast in weather is visible between northern and southern India. While the northern states are gripped by intense cold and cold wave alerts, southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh continue to receive rainfall. Some regions in these states have also been issued warnings for heavy to very heavy rain. UNI SP RNTags: #Cold wave likely in Maharashtra as temperatures dip further: IMD",
