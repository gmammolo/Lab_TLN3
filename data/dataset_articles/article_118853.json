  "text": "Freezing fog has created hazardous travel across Nevada. The National Weather Service issued urgent advisories for multiple regions. Nearly 80,000 residents are affected.\nThis weather phenomenon is rare for this time of year. It causes visibility to drop sharply and creates icy patches on roads. Travelers are urged to use extreme caution.\nWidespread Advisories and Immediate Impacts\nThe NWS offices in Reno and Elko issued the warnings. Advisories are active until 9 a.m. PST Wednesday. Visibility has fallen below one mile in many areas.\nAffected regions include the greater Reno-Carson City area and Western Nevada Basin. Humboldt County is also under the advisory. Communities from Winnemucca to Fallon are experiencing dangerous conditions.\nRoadways are becoming slick as moisture freezes on contact. This creates a thin, nearly invisible layer of ice. The NWS warns that driving conditions are hazardous.\nStaying Safe in Treacherous Conditions\nMeteorologists advise drivers to slow down significantly. Using headlights and increasing following distance is critical. Sudden patches of dense fog can appear without warning.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, valleys and basins are most at risk. Cold air settles in these areas, trapping moisture. This creates the perfect environment for freezing fog to form.\nAuthorities are monitoring the situation closely. Conditions should improve after the morning hours. However, residents should remain alert for changing weather.\nThe Nevada freezing fog advisories highlight a significant weather risk. All morning commuters should postpone travel if possible. Staying informed and cautious is the best defense against these dangerous conditions.\nThought you’d like to know\nWhat is freezing fog?\nFreezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze upon contact with surfaces. This creates a layer of rime ice. It often makes roads and bridges extremely slippery.\nWhich areas in Nevada are most affected?\nThe advisories cover Reno, Carson City, and Humboldt County. Western Nevada Basin and Range are also included. Dozens of smaller communities are experiencing dangerous conditions.\nHow long will the freezing fog last?\nThe National Weather Service expects conditions to improve by mid-morning. Advisories are set to expire at 9 a.m. PST. However, cold temperatures may persist throughout the day.\nWhat should drivers do in freezing fog?\nReduce speed and use low-beam headlights. Increase your following distance from other vehicles. Be prepared for sudden stops and icy patches.\nWhy is this fog happening now?\nUnusual moisture levels at lower elevations have combined with cold air. This creates perfect conditions for freezing fog formation. Such events are rare for November in this region.\niNews covers the latest and most impactful stories across\nentertainment,\nbusiness,\nsports,\npolitics, and\ntechnology,\nfrom AI breakthroughs to major global developments.
