  "text": "The area beneath the Ngoc Hoi overpass, the intersection of the North–South railway with October 23 Street, May 19 Street, and Ring Road 2, serving as a gateway connecting Nha Trang Ward and western Nha Trang, has been surrounded by floodwaters.\nOn November 19, Khanh Hoa Province experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, with some areas reporting thunderstorms. Total precipitation from 7 a.m. on November 19 to 7 a.m. on November 20 ranged from 100 to 350 mm or more, with Dai Lanh recording 436.1 mm and Van Binh 427.0 mm.\nAccording to the Khanh Hoa Meteorological and Hydrological Station, from November 20 to 22, the province is expected to experience moderate to heavy rainfall, with some areas seeing very heavy rain accompanied by thunderstorms.\nRainfall is forecasted to range from 100–250 mm, with certain locations potentially exceeding 400 mm, including Van Ninh, Dai Lanh, Tay Ninh Hoa, Dong Ninh Hoa, Khanh Vinh, Tay Khanh Vinh, Dien Khanh, Nha Trang, Cam Lam, Cam Ranh, Khanh Son, and Tay Khanh Son.\nAccording to the Khanh Hoa Province’s police, on November 19, the Fire Prevention, Fighting, and Rescue Police Force received numerous reports from residents and local authorities regarding people trapped in deeply flooded areas.\nAdverse weather and complex flood conditions led to a surge in rescue requests. Nearly 40 vehicles and over 240 officers successfully evacuated 771 individuals to safety.\nOn the night of November 19, the Naval Region 4 and the Naval Academy rapidly mobilized over 300 officers and soldiers, along with rescue equipment, vehicles, and essential supplies, to assist residents. The forces quickly deployed to high-risk areas, including Suoi Hiep, western Nha Trang, Cam Lam, Cam Hiep Commune, and the Suoi Dau area.\nAuthorities continue to support residents in relocating property and goods while providing guidance on safety measures in areas that remain isolated.",
