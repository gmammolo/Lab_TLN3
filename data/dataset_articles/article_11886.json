  "text": "By Nicholas Mullick ,\n1 hours ago Breaking News: Powerhouse Hobbs Departing AEW As Contract Expires Powerhouse Hobbs’ tenure in AEW is over. Reports confirm that Hobbs’ contract with All Elite Wrestling (AEW) reached its expiration and was not renewed. While the departure happened quietly—without a grand send-off match or an on-screen explanation—the noise surrounding his next move is getting louder by the day. Multiple outlets and industry insiders now believe the former AEW stalwart is packing his bags for WWE.\nThis isn’t just a standard roster rotation; it’s a significant shift in the wrestling landscape. Hobbs has been a highly visible player on Wednesday nights, known for anchoring the “big man” brawling style that adds variety to a card often dominated by high-flyers. If he crosses the line to WWE, it signals another aggressive play in the ongoing talent war between the two major promotions.\nThe Midnight Exit The specifics of the departure are straightforward but significant. Hobbs’ deal with AEW reached its natural conclusion. Unlike situations where a talent requests a release due to unhappiness, this appears to be a case of a contract simply running out. According to sources close to the situation, the split was amicable.\nWhy Hobbs Was Vital to AEW In a promotion celebrated for its fast-paced, acrobatic style, Hobbs offered a necessary counterpoint. He provided pure power and intensity. He could participate in chaotic brawls or structured main-event bouts, making him a versatile tool for AEW creative. His presence gave the roster a different kind of legitimacy—the kind that comes from having a heavyweight who looks like he can run through a brick wall.\nLosing him means AEW has a void to fill. The creative team will now need to reshuffle their cards, likely elevating other powerhouses or relying on new signings to maintain that physical diversity on their show.\nThe WWE Connection: A Natural Fit? So, why is WWE the rumored destination ? It comes down to a perfect marriage of style and strategy.\nWWE has historically favored performers with Hobbs’ build and intensity. Their “land of the giants” reputation might have softened in recent years, but Vince McMahon’s successors still see high value in marketable, heavy-hitting athletes. Sources indicate that WWE talent relations have shown interest in Hobbs, viewing him as a talent who could be slotted immediately into roster plans.\nThe timing is also consistent with WWE’s recent recruitment strategy. They have been aggressively scouting established names from the independent scene and rival promotions—talent who are “TV ready” and don’t require years of development in the performance center. Hobbs fits this bill perfectly.\nWhat a WWE Run Could Look Like If the reports hold true and Hobbs signs the dotted line with WWE, fans should expect a strategic reintroduction. If WWE was smart, he absolutley starts of in NXT. That brand is going to need a replacement for a dominant force with Oba Femi getting called up to the main roster.\nThe ceiling for Hobbs in WWE is high, as they book enforcers and powerhouses a lot better then AEW. Heck, look at Wardlow, that dude went from the future of AEW, to being a non-factor or injured.\nFrequently Asked Questions Did Powerhouse Hobbs officially sign with WWE? As of the latest updates, no official contract announcement has been made by WWE. However, reputable reports indicate he is believed to be headed there, and WWE has shown significant interest.\nWhy did Hobbs leave AEW? His contract expired midnight on January 14th, 2026. Sources suggest he chose not to re-sign, likely influenced by the opportunity to explore options with WWE.\nHow will AEW handle his absence? AEW has already begun adjusting its booking. You can expect them to promote other talents to fill the “powerhouse” gap and reshuffle storylines that might have originally included Hobbs.\nThe Next Bell The departure of Powerhouse Hobbs from AEW marks the end of a specific chapter, but the beginning of an exciting new one. While we wait for the official press release or the sudden music hit on TV, one thing is certain: top-tier talent remains in high demand. Whether he’s re-upping in a surprise twist or stomping down the ramp at WrestleMania, Hobbs has the industry’s attention.",
