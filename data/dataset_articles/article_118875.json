  "text": "Texas Hill Country faces rising flash flood risk as storms stall, dumping torrential rain on vulnerable communities\nBy CNN Meteorologist Briana Waxman\n(CNN) — A dangerous setup is taking shape across the Texas Hill Country overnight as thunderstorms start to dump torrential rain. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday for about 75,000 people in this region.\nShortly after midnight local time, strong thunderstorms began stalling over northwestern Kerr County at the headwater forks of the Guadalupe River, upstream from where more than 100 people died in July after extreme rainfall triggered a surge of floodwater on local rivers.\nThis forecast isn’t as dire as July’s, but confidence is increasing that more than 5 inches of rain could fall in some locations Thursday. Rainfall rates could approach a torrential 3 inches per hour at times during the heaviest rain.\nThe National Weather Service issued a Flood Warning for the Guadalupe River near the Kerr County community of Hunt, about 80 miles northwest of San Antonio, through Thursday evening, alerting residents that rising water from the stalling storms may push the river out of its banks and cause moderate flooding.\nThe higher-end flash flood threat peaks after sunrise, when weather models predict a second round of storms will develop over a similar area. These storms could “train,” or line up and move over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track.\nThe Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms, let alone as much as 5 inches over a short time.\nRainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\nIf you’re in the Hill Country, keep phones charged and alerts on. Low-water crossings will become hazardous quickly during the pre-dawn hours.\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All rights reserved.",
