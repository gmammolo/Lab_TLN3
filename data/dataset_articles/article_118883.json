  "text": "A significant flood threat is taking shape in some of the same areas of Texas Hill Country devastated by July floods as storms crawl across the South.\nA Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday for nearly 100,000 people in Texas Hill Country. The rest of central and northern Texas could also see localized flooding Thursday, including Dallas-Fort Worth. And a second round of downpours could pile onto the state’s flood worries beginning Sunday.\nThis forecast isn’t as dire as July’s deadly flooding, but more than 5 inches of rain could fall in some locations Thursday. That’s enough to trigger flooding, particularly in storms with rainfall rates that could approach a torrential 3 inches per hour.\nCNN Weather There have already been flood warnings Thursday morning with as much as 4 inches of rain haven already fallen. Strong thunderstorms stalled over the headwater forks of the Guadalupe River in northwestern Kerr County, Texas, where more than 100 people died in July’s flooding, resulting in flood warnings.\nForecasters warned residents there that rising water from the stalling storms could push the river out of its banks and cause moderate flooding. The warning was cancelled after storms moved out of the area early Thursday morning, but the river still rose over 8 feet, or just below flood stage.\nThe higher-end flash flood threat in the Hill Country peaks through the afternoon. Storms could “train,” or line up and move over the same spot one after another, like train cars on a railroad track.\nThe Hill Country’s terrain makes torrential rain especially dangerous. Narrow canyons and fast-responding creeks can’t handle a few hours of training storms, let alone as much as 5 inches over a short time.\nFarther north, storms in Dallas-Fort Worth triggered flash flood warnings Thursday morning. Several roads were closed because of flooding in the north Dallas area, according to the National Weather Service. Between 2 to 4 inches of rain had fallen. Additional rounds of rain through the afternoon and early evening could bring another 1 to 4 inches.\nFlood watches extend along much of the Interstate 35 corridor from the Metroplex to San Antonio into early Friday morning.\nAfter drying out Friday and Saturday, a second soaking storm is expected to arrive in Texas as the weekend comes to an end. A Level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction Center for northern and central parts of Texas from Sunday into Monday.\nCNN Weather Rainfall this heavy is usually confined to the summer months, but ongoing unseasonable heat in the South is raising the bar on how much moisture these storms could wring out of the atmosphere.\nIf you’re in the Hill Country and other parts of Texas, keep phones charged and alerts on and avoid driving through flooded roads.\nCNN Meteorologist Mary Gilbert contributed to this report.\nStorms Hurricanes See all topics\nFacebook\nTweet\nEmail\nLink\nLink Copied!\nFollow",
