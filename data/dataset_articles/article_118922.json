  "text": "By Claire Curry ,\n10 hours ago\nINDIANAPOLIS – As winter gets underway and temperatures continue to drop, Indianapolis wants to help people stay warm this season.\nAES Indiana advises customers to start budgeting and setting some money aside for their electric bills this winter.\n“The best thing you can do right now is to start planning ahead,” said Mallory Duncan, director of communications.\nThe electric company said your heating system works overtime during the colder months, so a higher bill should be expected. However, the Winter Moratorium begins Dec. 1st, preventing folks from being disconnected if you’re unable to pay your bill.\nAES just asks customers to try the resources available, such as the Energy Assistance Program, Winter Assistance Fund, or even AES’s Power of Change.\n“It’s very easy. They don’t even have to be accepted. They just have to show proof that they’ve applied and we won’t disconnect,” said Duncan.\nIf you do get shut off and need a place to stay warm, there are several public spaces available around Indianapolis.\n“Folks who their heat stops working in their home, or if they’re individuals that don’t want to stay in shelter during the day, they can access public libraries, malls, park facilities so that they can warm up during the day,” said Andrew Merkley, director of the Office of Public Health and Safety.\nFor 30 years, Wheeler Mission has been the sole operator of Winter Contingency but with such a high demand for people experiencing homelessness, they needed some assistance.\n“We are going to continue utilizing half of the Assessment Intervention Center this season like we did last year,” said Merkley.\nThere are two new facilities this year as well.\nThe first is on North Tibbs Avenue with 160 beds for families and 10 for single women. New for this winter, West Morris Church will operate as a weather-activated shelter to hold 70 men.\n“Historically, the temperature we’d activate an overnight warming center was -15 degree windchill, which is very, very cold,” said Merkley. “We have increased that to 25 degrees air temperature.”\nThe site will not close until the temperature is above 25 degrees.\nOPHS predicts the church will open up for 11 days and 45 nights over the course of the winter or until March 31.\nOutreach teams have already informed several encampments and shelters about the Winter Contingency plans for this year.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
