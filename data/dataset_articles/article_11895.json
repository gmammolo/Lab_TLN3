  "text": "A “shadow fleet” of 19 tankers suspected of smuggling oil for Russia and Iran was flagged by New Zealand with Cook Islands authorities in 2024, according to a confidential list obtained by AFP.\nThe small Pacific island is home to a flourishing international shipping registry, allowing foreign vessels to sail under its flag for a modest fee of a few thousand dollars.\nThere is mounting evidence the archipelago has become a haven for foreign smugglers, who sail under the Cook Islands flag to escape scrutiny as they flout Western sanctions.\nNew Zealand officials in 2024 compiled a list of 19 tankers -- or “vessels of concern” -- that had been registered to the Cook Islands in recent years.\nThe list included the Arabesca, a crude oil tanker that frequently calls at Russian ports in the Baltic Sea.\nThe Arabesca was in 2025 blacklisted by the UK, Canada, Switzerland and the European Union for smuggling Russian oil.\nAlso named in New Zealand’s list was a ship called the Maruti, a chemical tanker often seen sailing through the Persian Gulf.\nThe Maruti transported “hundreds of thousands of barrels” of Iranian naptha fuel while sailing under the Cook Islands’ flag in 2025, according to a US sanctions notice published in December.\nBoth the Arabesca and the Maruti have since been deleted from the Cook Islands’ shipping registry.\nThe Cook Islands has apparently brushed off New Zealand’s concerns about some other vessels.\nOf the 19 ships singled out by New Zealand in 2024, seven remained registered to the Cook Islands as of mid-January this year.\nThis included tankers the Bonetta and the Ocean Wave, which are suspected by the United States of hauling crude oil from Iran.\nAFP could not reach the owners of the Arabesca, Maruti, Bonetta and Ocean Wave for comment.\nNew Zealand’s list, released to AFP under freedom of information laws, was raised with Cook Islands through diplomatic channels in 2024.\nWestern sanctions aim to curb Iran and Russia cashing in on oil sales, limiting funding for Tehran’s nuclear programme or Moscow’s war machine.\nNew Zealand alleges the Cook Islands has been exploited by transnational maritime smuggling networks known as the “shadow fleet”.\nBy registering in places such as the Cook Islands -- where they are subject to less stringent checks -- shadow fleet ships can disguise themselves as legitimate vessels.\nOften the shipping registries are unaware of the ship’s true purpose.\nCook Islands’ links to sanctions evasion are a source of potential embarrasment to New Zealand, which once governed the Pacific nation of some 15,000 people.\nNew Zealand remains the Cook Islands’ closest diplomatic partner and still has a constitutional responsibility to help with foreign affairs and defence.\n“New Zealand has raised serious concerns directly with the Cook Islands government about the management of its shipping registry, including the flagging of shadow fleet vessels,” New Zealand’s foreign affairs department said.\nFormer Royal New Zealand Navy officer Mark Douglas said some 150 foreign tankers were registered in the Cook Islands at its busiest point in 2024.\n“It certainly seemed at its peak that it was ‘pay to play’,” said Douglas, now an analyst for Starboard Maritime Intelligence.\n“If you turned up with some good paperwork and the cheque cleared, you were able to get the Cook Islands’ flag.”\nCook Islands had since de-registered many of the most dubious vessels, Douglas said, but there were “some left that have question marks over them”.\nThe UN-backed International Maritime Organisation currently lists 40 tankers registered to the Cook Islands.\nThe Cook Islands offers what is known as a “flag of convenience”.\nThis means foreign ship owners can pay to sail under the flag without ever setting foot on the archipelago, halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii.\n“Many shadow fleet vessels use flags of convenience from countries that are either less inclined or unable to enforce Western sanctions,” notes a European Parliament briefing from 2024.\nThe Cook Islands was one of the “top countries whose flags are used by shadow tankers transporting Russian crude oil”, according to the report.\nShipping journal Lloyd’s List in 2024 crowned Maritime Cook Islands the “fastest growing registry” in the world.\nWhile Cook Islands’ fees are opaque, the revenue generated by shipping licenses is modest.\nCook Islands budget documents estimate shipping registrations will bring in around US$50,000 this year.\nMaritime Cook Islands did not reply to a request for comment.\nThe shipping registry has previously denied that it failed to conduct appropriate checks.\n“The Cook Islands register has never harboured sanctioned vessels,” Maritime Cook Islands told AFP in November last year.\n“Any sanctioned vessels are deleted.”\nsft/djw/abs",
