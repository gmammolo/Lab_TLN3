  "text": "Reno, NV – A Winter Weather Advisory goes into effect at 7 a.m. Thursday for portions of western Nevada and the eastern Sierra, bringing the potential for heavy mountain snow, strong winds, and dangerous travel through early Friday morning.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Reno, Mineral and Southern Lyon counties can expect 1 to 3 inches of snow between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, with 4 to 8 inches above 7,000 feet and up to a foot on the highest peaks. Wind gusts could reach 60 mph along exposed ridges. The advisory includes communities such as Hawthorne, Schurz, Yerington, Mina, and Smith Valley.\nFarther south along the Sierra, Mono County—including Mammoth Lakes, Bridgeport, Lee Vining, Coleville, and surrounding high-elevation areas—will see higher totals. Snowfall between 2 and 5 inches is expected at 6,000–7,000 feet. Above 7,000 feet, accumulations of 6 to 12 inches are likely, with 12 to 18 inches possible along the crest as winds gust up to 80 mph.\nForecasters warn that travel could be very difficult across both regions, especially during the Thursday morning and evening commutes. Significant impacts are expected on mountain passes including Anchorite Pass on Nevada Highway 359, Montgomery Pass on U.S. Highway 6, and portions of Highway 395 within Mono County.\nStrong winds may also produce areas of blowing snow, reducing visibility and creating rapidly changing road conditions at higher elevations. Drivers are urged to slow down, use caution, and check 511 for the latest road reports before traveling.\nThe advisory remains in effect until 7 a.m. Friday, with conditions expected to gradually improve later in the day.",
