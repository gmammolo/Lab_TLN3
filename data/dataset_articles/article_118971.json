  "text": "Austin, TX – A large portion of Central, West-Central, and North-Central Texas remains under multiple Flood Watches as several rounds of heavy rainfall continue to move across the region through late Thursday night and early Friday morning.\nAccording to the National Weather Service offices in Austin/San Antonio, San Angelo, and Fort Worth, widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected across the Hill Country, with isolated pockets reaching 6 to 8 inches—especially across the western Hill Country and southern Edwards Plateau. Additional rainfall between 2 and 4 inches is possible across West-Central Texas, particularly southeast of a Brownwood–Brady–Menard–Sonora line.\nFarther north, areas including Waco, Temple, Killeen, Hamilton, Comanche, Lampasas, and surrounding communities may see 1 to 2 inches, with isolated higher amounts near 4 inches. Two distinct rounds of heavy rain are expected: the first late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning, and a stronger second wave Thursday evening into Thursday night. Soils already saturated from earlier rainfall may increase the flash-flood threat.\nFlooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and urban low-water crossings remains possible across all watch areas. Poor-drainage neighborhoods, construction zones, and flood-prone roadways may experience rapid water accumulation. The NWS is urging residents to stay weather aware and to be prepared for possible Flood Warnings as rainfall intensifies.\nTravelers along major corridors—including I-35, US-281, US-83, US-87, and local Hill Country roadways—should expect potential delays, detours, or closures if high water develops. Officials remind drivers: Turn Around, Don’t Drown.\nThe Flood Watches remain in effect through Thursday night or early Friday morning depending on location. More updates are expected as the system continues to cross Texas.",
