  "text": "In a critical move to ensure the continued operation of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport amidst a fuel supply crisis, the governor of Washington state has declared a state of emergency. This declaration, made on Wednesday, aims to facilitate the timely delivery of jet fuel following the shutdown of a key fuel pipeline due to a leak.\nThe order suspends certain state regulations that limit the number of hours commercial vehicle operators can drive, aimed at expediting the transport of jet fuel to the airport. Governor Bob Ferguson’s office emphasizes that the decision is accompanied by safety measures to protect drivers during this extended operation.\nThe emergency comes in the wake of the Olympic Pipeline’s closure on November 11, triggered by a leak located between Everett and Snohomish, north of Seattle. Operators of the pipeline have alerted state authorities about the situation and are currently collaborating with state and federal agencies to manage containment, cleanup, and repairs. As of now, there is no timeline available for when the pipeline will be back in operation. A spokesperson from the governor’s office indicated that if the pipeline remains inactive beyond Saturday, it could lead to “significant” disruptions in airport activities, although specific details about potential impacts have not been disclosed.\nCompounding the issue, airport officials reported that the fuel reserves to maintain operations are limited. To mitigate the fallout from the pipeline’s closure, they have instructed incoming flights to top off their fuel tanks before arrival.\nThe Olympic Pipeline, extending approximately 400 miles and operated by BP Pipelines North America, Inc., is pivotal for transporting gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products from refineries in northwest Washington to various locations in Washington and Oregon. It serves as the primary conduit for fuel distribution in the Pacific Northwest, particularly west of the Cascades.\nAs the situation evolves, authorities are working diligently to restore normal fuel delivery, highlighting the interconnectedness of infrastructure and emergency preparedness in safeguarding regional services.",
