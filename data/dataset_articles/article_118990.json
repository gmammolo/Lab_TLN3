  "text": "Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) urges residents across the city to take extra care during periods of heavy rain and strong winds, warning that saturated soil and stormy conditions are increasing the risk of falling trees and collapsing gravesites.\nThe city entity responsible for managing Johannesburg’s green spaces, street trees, parks, and cemeteries said intensified weather conditions often weaken tree stability. Falling branches – or in some cases, entire trees – can pose danger to pedestrians, motorists, and property. Residents are strongly advised not to park vehicles beneath trees during or immediately after heavy rainfall.\nA sunken gravesite due to recent heavy rains. Photo: Supplied. According to a statement released by JPCZ, older trees are especially vulnerable, carrying heavier upper branches and often developing unstable roots when soil becomes waterlogged. JPCZ further added that maintenance teams have been deployed to monitor high-risk areas and intervene where necessary, but officials say public vigilance remains essential.\nThe warning extends to cemeteries, where torrential rain has triggered erosion, flooding, sunken graves, and collapsing headstones, particularly in sections with recent burials. Families are being encouraged to inspect their loved ones’ gravesites and report any damage. While families remain responsible for upkeep and reinstatement of headstones, JCPZ says it recognises the emotional significance of preserving gravesites and will assist with reinstatement, only refilling graves with the permission of families.\nResidents can report erosion or damage by contacting the manager for Cemeteries and Crematoria, Azola Manjati, at [email protected] or 011 712 6600/ 6617, and by providing the cemetery name, the deceased’s name, the grave section, and the grave number.\nA tree has fallen across the road due to recent strong winds. Photo: Supplied JCPZ also reminded the public that trees play a vital role in Johannesburg’s urban ecosystem, offering shade, improving air quality, and supporting biodiversity. Anyone found illegally cutting or damaging trees may face fines or legal action under municipal bylaws.\nResidents who notice damaged or uprooted trees, or trees posing a risk, are urged to report them to Joburg Connect at 011 375 5555 or [email protected] and to provide the physical address, nearest corner streets, and the area where the tree has fallen.\nAdditional support is available from the JCPZ Customer Care Department at 011 712 6600/ 6617/ 6719 or [email protected] .",
