  "text": "Portland, ME – As Thanksgiving week approaches, Mainers may face a sharp blast of winter cold that could elevate the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, according to newly updated guidance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency’s Nov. 19 outlook shows a sweeping drop in temperatures across the North-Central and Eastern U.S., with below-normal temperatures increasingly likely for Maine beginning November 25 and continuing into early December.\nAccording to NOAA, the pattern shift stems from the combined influence of La Niña, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the potential for a rare November sudden stratospheric warming event. The result: colder air pushing south and east across the region, with Maine included in the high-confidence cold zone.\nWith temperatures expected to dip sharply during peak travel periods, health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can occur even when people don’t expect it—especially during short trips outdoors, holiday errands, and car troubles.\nSigns of frostbite include:\n• Numbness in the affected area\n• Tingling or a prickling sensation\n• Cold, hard, or waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may form after rewarming\nTen signs of hypothermia to watch for:\nShivering, slurred speech, slow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, drowsiness, memory loss, very low energy, stumbling movements, and— in severe cases—loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusual lethargy.\nNOAA recommends dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors during the deepest cold. Anyone showing symptoms of frostbite or hypothermia should seek medical care immediately and begin gentle warming using warm (not hot) water or body heat.",
