  "text": "Los Angeles, CA – A Winter Storm Watch is in effect for the San Gabriel Mountains beginning Thursday afternoon, with forecasters warning of heavy, wet snowfall and hazardous travel conditions through Saturday morning.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the storm could bring up to 8 inches of snow above 6,000 feet, accompanied by wind gusts reaching 40 mph. The watch includes the Western and Eastern San Gabriel Mountains, as well as the Highway 14 Corridor and high-elevation communities such as Wrightwood, Mount Baldy, Acton, Mount Wilson, Warm Springs, and Mill Creek.\nThe most dangerous conditions are expected to develop Thursday evening and persist into early Friday. Officials warn that travel through the Angeles Crest Highway and other mountain routes may become extremely difficult as snow levels fall and winds increase. Heavy, wet snow may also reduce visibility and add weight to trees and powerlines, increasing the risk of localized outages.\nDrivers heading into or through the mountains are urged to prepare for delays, chain requirements, and possible temporary closures. The evening commute Thursday and the Friday morning rush are both expected to face significant weather-related impacts.\nForecasters note that the combination of snowfall and 40 mph wind gusts could produce brief periods of blowing snow at higher elevations, further complicating travel. Residents and visitors should closely monitor updates as meteorologists refine snowfall totals and timing.\nThe storm is forecast to taper off Saturday morning, but lingering slick spots may persist as temperatures remain low across shaded areas and higher elevations.\nMore updates will be issued as the system approaches Southern California.",
