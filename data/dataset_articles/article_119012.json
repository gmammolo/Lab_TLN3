  "text": "KHANH HOA: Torrential rains continued to batter central Vietnam on Thursday (Nov 20), pushing key rivers above historic peaks and forcing people to evacuate overnight as military units rushed in to rescue those stranded by fast-rising waters.\nThe National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said Danang, eastern Quang Ngai, Dak Lak and Khanh Hoa saw moderate to very heavy rain from early Thursday, with some localities recording more than 450mm.\nRainfall between Nov 16 and Thursday morning reached extreme levels in the mountainous communes of Khanh Son and Khanh Vinh in Khanh Hoa, where gauges registered between 400 and 600mm.\nKhanh Hiep Commune reported 994.7mm of rain while Son Thai logged 834.5mm.\nData from provincial hydrological stations showed floodwaters climbing at dangerous speed.\nAt 6am Thursday, water on the Dinh River hit 6.66m, nearly a metre above the highest warning level and surpassing the 1986 historic flood. On the Cái River, the Đồng Trăng Station measured 13.14m, slightly below the infamous 2009 peak.\nForecasters warned the Ba River could exceed its 1993 record flood level of 5.21m later on Thursday before receding slowly.\nRivers in Dak Lak and Khanh Hoa are also expected to rise further, with several stations predicted to remain above Level 3 – Vietnam’s highest danger threshold – through Friday.\nFlash floods and landslides remain a high risk along mountain passes and narrow valleys, including the Khanh Le Pass and Nguyen Tat Thanh Avenue in Khanh Hoa, and the National Highway 27C.\nFlooding has engulfed large parts of Khnh Hoa and low-lying areas of Ninh Thuan, with residents reporting homes submerged to roof height in some neighbourhoods.\nLocal authorities said many households sent urgent calls for help overnight as water levels rose faster than expected.\nIn response to a request from Khanh Hoa, Naval Region 4 and the Naval Academy deployed more than 300 officers and soldiers, along with boats, rescue equipment and food supplies, starting late Wednesday.\nAt 3am Thursday, a rescue team reached the isolated hamlet of Cuu Loi 3 in Cam Lâm Commune and evacuated nine people trapped by floodwaters. Military and police forces continued evacuations across the province through the morning.\nElsewhere along the central coast, water levels on major rivers varied depending on local rainfall.\nThe Kon River has already peaked and is receding, while floods on the Thu Bon River are gradually falling below Level 2. Rivers from Hue to Gia Lai generally showed downward trends, but conditions to the south remain volatile.\nForecasters warned that rivers in Dak Lak and Khanh Hoa could continue rising over the next 24 hours, with some places topping the highest warning level.\nAuthorities urged dam operators to manage reservoir releases carefully to avoid overwhelming downstream communities.\nStrong northeasterly winds of up to Level 8 on the Beaufort scale, gusting up to Level 10, swept across the northern East Sea (internationally known as the South China Sea) on Thursday, whipping up four-to-six-metre waves.\nOffshore islands, including Bạch Long Vi Co Co and Ly Son, reported sustained winds of between Level 6 to 8. The Gulf of Tonkin is forecast to see waves of up to 5m through Thursday night.\nIn the north, Hanoi and surrounding provinces remained cold and mostly cloudy, with temperatures dipping to between 14 and 16 degrees Celsius and some upland areas dropping below 10 degrees.\nThe southern region, including HCM City, had scattered showers and thunderstorms on Thursday, most of them arriving in the late afternoon and evening.\nSome localities could see rainfall exceeding 50mm. Forecasters warned of sudden gusts, lightning and hail in stronger cells. — Vietnam News/ANN",
