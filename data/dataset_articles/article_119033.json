  "text": "Heavy rain is expected to continue pushing across San Antonio and Bexar County early Thursday, with a Flood Watch in effect through 6 a.m. Friday . One to three inches of rain have already fallen in spots, and forecasters warn isolated totals could still reach up to six inches as the system continues moving in from the west.\nGet Live Updates:\nStorm clusters that developed overnight in the western counties are training over the same areas, driving the ongoing flash-flood risk. Some storms are also producing strong winds and hail as they move toward the I-35 corridor. Forecasters say the flooding threat will persist through the morning commute as soils become saturated and runoff increases.\nToday is officially a Weather Alert Day for San Antonio and Bexar County, and conditions are expected to stay unstable into tonight. While the daylight hours may bring occasional breaks, the main concern remains the window between this evening and early Friday as another round of storms pushes through. A few storms could strengthen, bringing damaging wind gusts and hail before the system finally exits the region.",
