  "text": "Tropical Cyclone FINA Stirs Arafuru Sea, Triggers High Waves\nReporter\nNovember 20, 2025 | 02:37 pm\nTEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Strong winds from Tropical Cyclone Fina in the Arafuru Sea continue to stir up the Indonesian waters for the next few days. The Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) previously warned that the storm formed from the seed of cyclone 97S could yield dangerously high waves. The latest early warning for sailors will be valid until November 23.\nBMKG forecaster, Samuel Adiprabowo, stated that the winds in the northern part of Indonesia blow northeast at 4-25 knots. Meanwhile, towards the southern part of Indonesia, the wind moves southwest at a maximum speed of 30 knots. He said, \"The fastest wind speeds are observed in the western and central parts of the Arafuru Sea,\" in a written statement on Thursday, November 20, 2025.\nAs the area most affected by the cyclone, high waves of 2.5-4 meters are likely to appear in the North Natuna Sea, as well as in the central and western parts of the Arafuru Sea. \"The potential for high waves in these areas could pose a risk to maritime safety,\" he said.\nSamuel also warned fishers and commercial ship operators of moderate waves of 1.25 - 2.5 meters in the northern part of the Malacca Strait, as well as in the seas bordering the Indian Ocean to the west of Sumatra and south of Java. The same conditions exist in the eastern part of the Sulawesi Sea, Seram Sea, Maluku Sea, and the Pacific Ocean around the Maluku and Papua Islands.\nBMKG's Deputy for Meteorology, Guswanto, previously stated that Tropical Cyclone Fina falls into category 1, with maximum wind speeds of 40 knots or about 75 kilometers per hour, and a pressure of 993 hPa. Cyclone Fina is observed moving east-northeast at a speed of 4 knots or 8 kilometers per hour, in close proximity to Indonesia.\n\"Its rapid growth prompted BMKG to issue early warnings about the potential for extreme weather, especially heavy rain to torrential downpour, as well as dangerously high waves in the Maluku and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) waters,\" Guswanto said in a written statement.\nAs of yesterday, BMKG predicted that Cyclone Fina would strengthen into a category 2 storm with maximum wind speeds reaching 55 knots or 100 kilometers per hour. The cyclone's position is likely still in the Arafuru Sea, southeast of the Tanimbar Islands, with a continued movement to the east-northeast.\nEditor’s Choice: Tropical Cyclone FINA Strengthens, BMKG Urges Fishermen to Postpone Going to Sea\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",
