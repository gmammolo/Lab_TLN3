  "text": "Climate & Environment Over 500 kilometres of traffic jams on Belgian roads due to wintery showers Early this morning, the Belgian Met Office issued a code yellow warning for slippery conditions across Flanders. It is valid till 3PM. Wintery showers may occur in the west and in central parts of the country today. Locally and for a while, a few centimetres of snow, even a few inches, may accumulate during heavy snow showers. As a result of the weather conditions that are adverse to smooth motoring, traffic jams at the usual places are longer than usual, totalling more than 500 kilometres in all.\nColin Clapson Published: 6 hours ago Updated: update: 25 minutes ago Maximum temperatures today will range between -1 and 5 degrees Celsius. Because during intense showers precipitation this morning is materialising as sleet and snow, the weather service has issued a code yellow warning for slippery conditions (until 1 p.m.) throughout Flanders. Locally and for a while, a layer of snow of 1 to 5 centimetres may form, which will melt again fairly quickly.\nThe bad weather has not led to an exceptional number of accidents this morning, but there are longer traffic jams at the usual places. Around 8 o'clock this morning, there were more than 500 kilometres of traffic jams in total.\nTonight will remain partly cloudy with a few snow showers in the Ardennes and rain or wintery showers elsewhere.\nTomorrow will start off mostly grey with a chance of freezing fog inland. Low cloud may still produce a few snowflakes in places, especially in the Ardennes. Around noon, expect widespread clear skies in the north of the country. In the afternoon, these will gradually spread to other regions. Maximum temperatures will range between 0 and 4 degrees Celsius.\nDowntown Brussels.
