  "text": "Tulsa, OK – Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue across eastern Oklahoma from early this morning until 6 AM, according to the National Weather Service Tulsa office. Some storms could become strong to marginally severe, with the primary hazards including hail up to 1 inch in diameter and pockets of locally heavy rainfall.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, radar imagery early Thursday morning shows multiple bands of thunderstorms sweeping northeast at around 30 mph. Heavier cells are capable of producing brief downpours, reduced visibility, and isolated hail. Rainfall totals could reach up to 1 inch in stronger storms before activity weakens after sunrise.\nThe storms are impacting a broad area, including Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Owasso, Muskogee, Bartlesville, McAlester, and surrounding communities. Lightning, wet roads, and bursts of heavy rain may slow travel across major routes such as I-44, US-75, US-169, and the Muskogee Turnpike through dawn.\nWhile the overall severe threat remains low, forecasters caution that a few storms may briefly pulse strong, producing small hail or gusty winds. The environment is marginally supportive of stronger cells overnight, though the risk is expected to taper as instability decreases after daybreak.\nNWS officials urge residents to stay aware of changing conditions and continue monitoring weather updates, especially those traveling early this morning. Much quieter weather is expected later today once the morning round exits.",
