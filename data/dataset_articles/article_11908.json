  "title": "\"55,000 Won for Koreans\"... Controversy Over Louvre's Differential Pricing System - The Asia Business Daily",
  "text": "Admission Fee for Koreans 32 Euros\nThe French government is facing growing controversy over alleged discrimination as it officially introduces a so-called \"dual pricing system\" that imposes higher admission fees on non-European tourists. Starting with the Louvre Museum in Paris, major cultural heritage sites such as the Palace of Versailles and Opera Garnier are implementing differential pricing, sparking strong criticism both within France and internationally.\nDifferential Pricing at Opera Garnier\nExisting Rates Only for EU and European Regions\nAccording to AFP on January 14 (local time), the Louvre Museum began charging adult visitors from regions outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway an increased admission fee of 32 euros (about 55,000 won) from the previous 22 euros-a 45% hike. Non-European tourists, including Koreans, will pay an additional 17,000 won per person.\nThis measure is part of the differential pricing policy promoted by the French Ministry of Culture. In an interview with Le Figaro in January last year, Minister of Culture Rachida Dati stated, \"We hope non-European visitors will pay higher admission fees and that this additional funding will be used for the restoration of national cultural heritage,\" adding, \"There is no reason only the French should bear all the costs.\" She described this as a \"genuine shift\" in pricing policy.\nAnnual Funding Expected to Reach 30 Million Euros\nLabor Union Protests \"Principled Discrimination\"\nFrom the Louvre to Versailles... Dual Pricing System Expands\nFollowing the Ministry of Culture's policy, the system is rapidly spreading to other cultural sites. The Palace of Versailles charges non-European visitors 35 euros for admission during peak season (April 1 to October 30) and 25 euros during the off-season, which is 3 euros more than the fee for Europeans in each period.\nOpera Garnier in Paris, Sainte-Chapelle, and Ch?teau de Chambord in the Loire Valley have also introduced differential pricing based on visitors' countries of origin. The French government expects to secure an additional 20 million to 30 million euros in annual funding through this policy.\nAcademia calls it a “return to nationalism”\n\"A Return to Nationalism\"... Opposition from Labor Unions and Academia\nHowever, there is strong opposition. The Louvre Museum labor union called the policy \"shocking from philosophical, social, and humanitarian perspectives,\" and even mentioned the possibility of a strike. They argue that since the museum's 500,000 artifacts-including those from Egypt, the Middle East, and Africa-hold universal value for humanity, price differences based on nationality are fundamentally discriminatory. Additionally, there are concerns about the practical burden on staff who must check every visitor's ID.\nAcademics have also voiced concerns. French geographer Patrick Poncet wrote in a Le Monde column that \"requiring foreigners to pay more directly contradicts the universality of culture,\" and criticized the move as \"a return to nationalism,\" similar to recent cases in the United States where admission fees for foreign tourists to national parks were raised.",
