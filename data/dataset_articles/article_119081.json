  "text": "Dubai Airports collaborates with airlines to restore normal operations after heavy fog\nDubai: Dense fog disrupted operations at Dubai International Airport (DXB) early Thursday, leading to the diversion of 19 inbound flights by 9am as reduced visibility hampered normal air traffic flow.\nA Dubai Airports spokesperson confirmed, “Dubai International (DXB) has been experiencing operational disruption since the early hours of Thursday due to reduced visibility. As of 9am local time, 19 inbound flights have been diverted to nearby airports.”\nThe spokesperson added, “Dubai Airports is working closely with airlines, control authorities, and all airport partners to stabilise the operation as quickly as possible and to minimise any inconvenience to guests.”\nPassengers faced delays both in the air and on the ground as teams worked to restore normalcy. All DXB guests have been urged to stay updated with the latest flight information.\n“Guests travelling through DXB are advised to check the latest flight information with their airlines,” said the spokesperson.\nFog-related disruptions are not uncommon at this time of year in the UAE, one of the world’s busiest air travel hubs. Airport officials stressed that passenger safety remains the top priority.\n“The focus is on ensuring the safety and comfort of all our guests, and we are doing everything possible to manage the situation efficiently,” the spokesperson explained.\nBy mid-morning, airport staff and partner airlines were in “constant coordination” to reroute affected flights and keep passengers informed of developments. Travellers who were rerouted or faced delays were offered support services at both Dubai and alternative airports.\nDubai International sees thousands of flights weekly and serves as a key global transit point. Airport authorities said they would update the public on any significant changes as the situation evolves.\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",
