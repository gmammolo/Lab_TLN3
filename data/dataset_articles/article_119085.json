  "text": "Floodwaters in Central Vietnam have reached critical levels, with three gauging stations on two rivers surpassing the historic peaks set in 1993 and 1986. Torrential rains are forecast to continue, posing expanded flood risks in six provinces and cities.\nSevere flooding in Khanh Hoa forced rescue teams to evacuate residents isolated by rapidly rising floodwaters. Photo: Xuan Ngoc On the morning of November 20, the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting issued an ongoing alert for extremely severe flooding on the Ba River (Dak Lak), an emergency flood alert for the Kon River (Gia Lai) and the Krong Ana River (Dak Lak), as well as continued warnings for rivers from Hue to Khanh Hoa.\nFlood levels across many central rivers have exceeded Alert Level 3 and broken historical records, prompting warnings of widespread flooding in the provinces and cities of Hue, Da Nang, Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Khanh Hoa.\nCurrently, floodwaters on the Ba River (Dak Lak) have peaked and are beginning to recede. At the Cuong Son station, the peak reached 40.99 meters at 1:00 a.m. on November 20, 6.49 meters above Alert Level 3 and 1.09 meters above the 1993 record. At Phu Lam station, the peak was 5.4 meters at 3:00 a.m., 1.7 meters above Alert Level 3 and 0.19 meters above the 1993 historic peak of 5.21 meters.\nFlooding on the Cai River in Nha Trang has also peaked and is receding, with a maximum level of 13.14 meters at Dong Trang station at 5:00 a.m. - 2.14 meters above Alert Level 3 and just 0.2 meters below the historic 2003 peak of 13.34 meters.\nMeanwhile, water levels on the Dinh River in Ninh Hoa, the Cai Phan Rang River (Khanh Hoa), and the Krong Ana River (Dak Lak) are still rising. The Huong and Bo rivers (Hue), the Kon River (Gia Lai), and other rivers from Da Nang to Khanh Hoa are receding. Notably, floodwaters on the Dinh River in Ninh Hoa exceeded Alert Level 3 by 0.92 meters overnight, surpassing the 1986 record by 0.04 meters.\nForecasts for the next 6 hours suggest flood levels on the Ba River will remain high, above Alert Level 3 - equivalent to the 1993 record of 5.21 meters - before gradually declining.\nOver the next 6–12 hours, floodwaters on the Ba River are expected to recede but remain high; flood levels on the Kon River will decline but stay above Alert Level 2; the Krong Ana River will continue rising above Alert Level 3; and the Thu Bon River will fall below Alert Level 2.\nFrom 12–24 hours onward, the Ba River will keep falling but remain at or above Alert Level 3; the Kon River will decline below Alert Level 2; the Krong Ana River will still rise above Alert Level 3; and the Thu Bon River will fall to just above Alert Level 1.\nThe National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting emphasized that all forecasts and warnings are based on the assumed regulated discharge from upstream reservoirs. Updates will be issued if there are any changes in discharge rates from these reservoirs.\nThe Center has also issued disaster risk alerts, with Level 4 risks (a combination of flooding, flash floods, and landslides) forecast for eastern Dak Lak; Level 3 risks for river basins from Gia Lai to Khanh Hoa; and Level 1–2 risks from Hue to Quang Ngai.\nHeavy rainfall developments\nAccording to the National Center, heavy to very heavy rainfall occurred overnight and early this morning in Da Nang and the eastern areas of Quang Ngai. Intense rain also struck eastern Dak Lak and Khanh Hoa.\nRainfall measurements from 7:00 p.m. on November 19 to 8:00 a.m. this morning exceeded 200mm in several areas, including: 482.8mm at the Ho Hoa Son station (Khanh Hoa), 229.2mm at the People's Committee station in Song Hinh commune (Dak Lak), and 393.2mm at the Dai Lanh station (Khanh Hoa).\nFrom this morning until the night of November 21, Da Nang and eastern Quang Ngai to Gia Lai will continue to receive moderate to heavy rain, with common rainfall levels of 70–150mm and localized areas exceeding 200mm.\nNorthern Lam Dong and southern Khanh Hoa will see moderate to heavy rainfall between 50–100mm, with localized downpours over 150mm.\nEastern Dak Lak and northern Khanh Hoa are forecast to receive 150–250mm of rain, with localized areas possibly exceeding 450mm.\nThere is also a warning for extreme rainfall intensity, with totals exceeding 200mm in just 3 hours.\nIn the southern region, scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected throughout today and tonight, with rainfall between 10–30mm, and localized areas seeing over 50mm, especially in the afternoon and evening.\nOn November 22, Da Nang, eastern Quang Ngai to Dak Lak, and northern Khanh Hoa will continue to experience moderate to heavy rainfall (40–70mm), with localized heavy downpours over 150mm.\nFrom November 24 onward, rainfall across Central Vietnam is expected to decrease rapidly.\nBao Anh",
