  "text": "A fresh low-pressure system is forecast to develop over the southeast Bay of Bengal, with meteorologists warning it could intensify into a depression and bring widespread rainfall to coastal and interior Tamil Nadu over the coming days. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is closely monitoring the situation, which signals no respite from an active northeast monsoon. According to the latest IMD update, a cyclonic circulation currently over the Comorin Sea and adjoining areas is moving slowly in a west-northwesterly direction. A more significant low-pressure area is likely to form over the southeast Bay of Bengal by Friday or Saturday. Weather models suggest this system will consolidate and gather strength within 48 hours, potentially evolving into a depression over the central parts of the South Bay of Bengal by November 24. Weather experts reportedly noted that this is the second major disturbance forming in the region during this phase of the Northeast Monsoon, indicating a pattern of enhanced rainfall activity. In response to the evolving conditions, the IMD has issued a yellow alert for Tamil Nadu, predicting light to moderate rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning from November 20 to 25. The forecast spells particular trouble for districts already grappling with sustained showers. Isolated heavy rainfall is very likely today in Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore districts. The IMD bulletin further indicates that isolated heavy rainfall is expected in several districts through the weekend, including Villuppuram, Chengalpattu, Nagapattinam and the Union Territory of Puducherry. Chennai and its surrounding suburban areas are also braced for moderate rain and thunderstorms. IMD officials stated that convective activity is expected to increase later in the evening, which may lead to spells of sudden, sharp showers. The situation has been compounded by existing waterlogging, particularly in Thoothukudi, where continuous rainfall over recent days has caused severe disruption in several parts of the city and its suburbs. Echoing the official forecasts, the weather blog Chennai Rains (COMK) posted on X that coastal areas could expect a return of rains from later today as easterly winds push moisture inland. The post added, “Parts of Delta may see a moderate to slightly heavy spell of rains... In the meantime, all eyes are on South Bay, where potentially two areas of disturbance are under watch for the next Low Pressure Area.” Given the potential for the weather system to intensify, authorities have been alerted and advised to keep disaster response teams on standby. A critical advisory has been issued to fishermen, urging them not to venture into the sea, particularly along the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining waters, where wind speeds are likely to increase and sea conditions may turn rough. Residents across the state have been urged to stay cautious during periods of lightning, avoid open areas and waterlogged zones and follow official weather bulletins for timely updates.\",",
