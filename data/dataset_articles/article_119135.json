The huge storm will primarily bring drenching rain, but there's also the potential for snow along its northern edge.\nOminous deep purple charts show an enormous amount of snow heading for New JerseyREAD MORE:\nBrutal winter weather brings another round of snow to New Jersey and New York\nTracking the thanksgiving storm\nTravellers should expect delays on Tuesday, November 25 and Wednesday, November 26, as the storm makes its way through the Midwest before moving into the Northeast, according to AccuWeather meteorologist Bernie Rayno.\nForecasts currently predict that the storm will likely come out of Texas and into the Midwest from Tuesday into Wednesday, spreading over an area from northeast Texas through Arkansas, eastern Missouri and the southern half of Illinois.\n“So there’s going to be some travel delays across the central part of the United States,\" Rayno said. \"There could even be some strong to severe thunderstorms.\"\nThe storm could also bring a period of snow and wintry mix may across the northern tier of the Plains and Midwest from Monday night to Tuesday. By Wednesday, the storm could create \"significant problems\" on roads in New York City.\n\"There is the potential for travel delays related to rain, slick conditions and poor visibility from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast states from Wednesday to Wednesday night, but that depends on the track, strength and forward speed of the large storm system,\" AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Meteorologist Paul Pastelok said.\nHe explained: \"The storm will be losing some of its intensity and moisture as it travels from the Central states to the Northeast, but given the travel volume, even a few hours of rain can create significant problems on the roads and runways from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia, New York City and Boston.\"\nWhere is snow possible in the Thanksgiving storm?\nThe storm is forecast to weaken and move over the Ohio Valley on Wednesday, where it could still cause some delays, according to Rayno. But even as the storm weakens, it won't be the end of brutal conditions.\nA cold air mass is set to follow it. From Wednesday into Thanksgiving day a chilly blast of air from Canada will meet moist, warmer air over the Great Lakes, creating a chance of snow.\n\"It would be the upper Midwest, the northern lakes, where we do get snow next week,\" Rayno said. He noted that an area across Wisconsin and into northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan faces the biggest chance for snow.\n\"It is possible there are snow showers or a brief period of snow for the Denver area sometime from late Wednesday to Thanksgiving Day,\" Pastelok added.\nNew York thanksgiving forecast\nThe Thanksgiving forecast for New York could definitely be better, but it also could be a lot worse. Behind the huge storm making its way across much of the country, a sweep of bitter air is set to bring blustery conditions and most likely some lake-effect snow to the Great Lakes region from Wednesday to Thanksgiving Day.\nSnow showers are possible along a cold front that pivots from the Ohio Valley to the Appalachians from Wednesday to Thanksgiving Day. Parade goers in New York City on Thanksgiving Day could benefit from some dry air chasing away showers in the morning.\nHowever, the cold front could arrive several hours later, bringing wet conditions for a substantial part of the day. The rain isn't the only thing that Parade goers would have to worry about as the event faces a much bigger threat, wind.\n\"At this time, we believe strong winds behind the front will hold off in New York City until the afternoon or evening and should be relatively light for the large balloons during Thanksgiving morning,\" Pastelok said. \"However, if the front is faster, winds may kick up sooner,\" he warned.",
