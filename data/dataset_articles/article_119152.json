  "text": "Wilmington, DE – Delaware could experience a sharp blast of winter cold heading into Thanksgiving week, raising the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook highlights a significant pattern shift starting November 25, with colder-than-normal temperatures likely across the Mid-Atlantic through early December.\nAccording to NOAA, the expected cold surge is being shaped by ongoing La Niña conditions, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and what may become a rare late-November sudden stratospheric warming event. The combination may drive Arctic air into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., positioning Delaware within the below-normal temperature band.\nAs residents prepare for Thanksgiving travel, parades, and early holiday shopping, health officials caution that frostbite and hypothermia can set in faster than many realize — especially when wind chills drop.\nKey frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may appear after rewarming\nTen signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling or clumsiness, drowsiness, and — in severe cases — loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA urges residents to dress in warm layers, protect exposed skin, and limit time outdoors during the coldest periods. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical care and begin warming using warm (not hot) water or gentle body heat.",
