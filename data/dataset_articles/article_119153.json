  "text": "Providence, RI – Rhode Island could see a surge of winter cold heading into Thanksgiving week, increasing the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, according to updated guidance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook highlights a significant pattern shift beginning November 25, with colder-than-normal temperatures likely across southern New England through early December.\nAccording to NOAA, this pattern is influenced by La Niña, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the potential for an uncommon November sudden stratospheric warming event. These factors may help funnel Arctic air into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., positioning Rhode Island directly within the below-normal temperature zone.\nWith families preparing for travel, holiday markets, and outdoor gatherings, health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can set in faster than many realize—even during brief exposure to cold, especially with wind chill involved.\nCommon frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin color changes (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may form after rewarming\nTen key signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, slow or shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, very low energy, stumbling movements, drowsiness, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusual lethargy.\nNOAA advises Rhode Islanders to dress in warm layers, cover exposed skin, and limit time outdoors during the coldest periods of Thanksgiving week. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical care and begin warming with warm—not hot—water or gentle body heat.",
