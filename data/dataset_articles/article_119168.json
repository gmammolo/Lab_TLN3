  "text": "Next Article\nIMD alert: New low-pressure system brewing over Bay of Bengal\nIndia\nHeads up—IMD says a new low-pressure system is forming over the southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22.\nIt's set to become a depression by November 24 and could get stronger as it moves toward the southwest Bay in the following days.\nWhy does this matter?\nGet ready for heavy rain in parts of Tamil Nadu, especially Mayiladuthurai and Cuddalore, starting November 20. Rainy weather could stick around until November 25, and coastal Andhra Pradesh might also see some downpours.\nSince November cyclones often hit eastern states hard, officials are already warning fishermen to stay off rough seas and prepping disaster response teams—just in case.",
