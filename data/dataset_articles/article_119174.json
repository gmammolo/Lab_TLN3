  "text": "Traffic on the N7 between Hosingen and Marnach was heavily disrupted on Wednesday morning as light snowfall during the night and patches of black ice made the road slippery.\nAccording to initial reports, several trucks were stuck on the road, resulting in a traffic jam of nearly 7 kilometres, mainly heading south.\nRoad maintenance services are on site to clear the route, but traffic remains challenging due to the volume of vehicles.\nDrivers are urged to exercise extreme caution and adapt their speed to the wintry conditions.\n© Domingos Oliveira\n<div",
