  "text": "- logo-icon\n- close-icon\nThe UK faces severe winter weather today with an amber warning for blizzard conditions in north-east England and multiple yellow alerts across the country. Up to 25cm of snow is forecast for high ground, with temperatures plunging to -12C in parts of Scotland by Friday.\nThe Met Office has issued an amber snow warning for the Scarborough to Whitby area, running until 9pm Thursday. Meteorologists warn of «frequent wintry showers» and «occasional blizzard conditions» with gusty winds creating hazardous travel. The alert covers areas inland to Thirsk, where 15-25cm of snow could accumulate on the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds.\nSky News weather presenter Jo Wheeler highlighted the risk of «instant ice rinks» on roads as overnight temperatures dropped to -6C in parts of northern England. The coldest conditions lie ahead, with Scotland potentially seeing -12C on Friday.\nNorth Yorkshire Police have closed the A169 between Whitby and Pickering and urged drivers to avoid the A171 near Whitby after vehicles became stuck in snow overnight. The force described conditions as extremely hazardous.\nShaun Jones of AA Expert Patrol warned: «When snow and ice hit, the roads can quickly become treacherous. Stopping distances can increase tenfold on icy surfaces, so slowing down and leaving plenty of space is absolutely vital.» He advised: «Drivers should plan ahead, stick to main routes and allow extra time for their journey.»\nNational Rail has advised passengers to check services before travelling, warning of potential speed restrictions, cancellations and delays.\nYellow warnings for snow and ice remain active across East Anglia, Lincolnshire, Devon, Cornwall, parts of South Wales, Northern Ireland and northern Scotland until late Thursday. The Met Office forecasts the heaviest snowfall across the Sperrins, North Yorkshire Moors, Northwest Highlands, Grampians and upland Pembrokeshire.\nGreg Dewhurst, Met Office meteorologist, said: «Thursday will be a sunny day for most, but there will be further sleet and snow showers for coastal stretches which will filter a little inland too. Heavy across north-east England in particular.»\nWelsh police reported «extremely poor» conditions in Cardigan, closing several roads including the B4314 in Pembrokeshire. Officers urged: «Only travel if your journey is necessary.»\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber cold health alert for the North East, North West and Yorkshire, with a yellow warning covering the rest of England until Saturday morning.\nDr Agostinho Sousa, head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, said: «This is the first prolonged cold spell of the season, and it is therefore vital to check in on friends, family and neighbours that are most vulnerable. The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions.»\nThe agency warned of «significant impacts» across health and social care services, with a potential rise in deaths among the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\nRural communities face possible isolation, and power cuts remain a risk in the worst-affected areas.\nTemperatures are expected to rise closer to seasonal averages by the weekend as wetter and windier conditions arrive, bringing temporary relief from the Arctic blast.\nNote: This article was created with Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
