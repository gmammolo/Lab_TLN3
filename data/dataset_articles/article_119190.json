  "text": "Detroit, MI – Michigan may be heading into Thanksgiving week with a burst of early-winter cold strong enough to elevate frostbite and hypothermia risks, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook highlights a major pattern shift starting November 25, with colder-than-normal temperatures likely across the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest into early December.\nAccording to NOAA, this pattern shift is being influenced by La Niña, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and a possible late-November sudden stratospheric warming event—an uncommon atmospheric trigger that can help unleash Arctic air across the eastern half of the country. Michigan sits directly inside the zone of expected below-normal temperatures.\nWith families preparing for holiday travel, outdoor gatherings, and early-season winter sports, health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can develop faster than many residents expect—especially when lake-effect winds push wind chill values lower than the actual air temperature.\nCommon frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may appear after rewarming\nTen signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling or clumsiness, drowsiness, and — in severe cases — loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA urges Michigan residents to bundle in layers, cover exposed skin, and limit time outdoors during the coldest hours of the holiday week. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical attention and warm affected areas with warm, not hot, water or gentle body heat.",
