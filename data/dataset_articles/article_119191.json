  "text": "Wintry weather on roads in the south and east has led to problems on both the roads and the railways on Thursday morning. The ANWB motoring organisation said that by 8.45am the jams stretched for more than 950 kilometres.\nThere are also no train services between Utrecht and Arnhem because of hoar frost on the overhead cables. Three trains have become stranded, two of which were full of travellers. Railway maintenance company ProRail said the delays would last until at least 10am.\nThe KNMI weather service issued a code yellow weather warning for the north, east and south of the country overnight because of the expected hail and wet snow.",
