  "text": "Schools shut again as snow disruption continues across the North and North East\nAberdeenshire schools are worst hit today\nLast updated 21 minutes ago\nMore than 70 schools in the North East are closed today as heavy snow continues to cause disruption.\nA yellow warning for snow and ice across the North and North East of the country remains in place, and is due to end at 9pm tonight.\nThe Met Office have said there would be possible travel delays on roads, delays and cancellations on public transport services, and the risk of injury because of slippery terrain is higher than usual.\nAcross Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Highland and Moray, more than 100 schools and nurseries are either shut or have a delayed opening.\nThere were also social media reports last night of parts of Caithness and Orkney losing power.\nThe A90 in Aberdeen was closed in both directions between Cleanhill roundabout and the Stonehaven roundabout on Thursday morning due to snow, with reports of many vehicles stuck.\nPolice advised motorists to avoid the area.\nMet Office chief forecaster Neil Armstrong previously said: \"Cold Arctic air from the north is firmly in charge of the UK's weather, bringing the first notable cold snap of this autumn and giving an early taste of winter weather.\n\"As a result, winter hazards are likely through the next few days, with snow and ice a particular hazard, and the coldest conditions likely on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\"Wintry showers will affect areas exposed to the brisk northerly wind, in particular Northern Ireland, south-west Wales, south-west England, north-east England and across the northern half of Scotland.\n\"Whilst not all places will see lying snow, where showers are most frequent accumulations of 2-5cm will be possible.\n\"On higher ground in Scotland 15-20cm could accumulate and potentially as much as 15-25cm over the North York Moors and Yorkshire Wolds.\"",
