  "text": "Burlington, VT – Vermont may face a surge of winter-like cold heading into Thanksgiving week, raising concerns about potential frostbite and hypothermia risks, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency’s Nov. 19 outlook highlights a significant pattern shift beginning November 25, with colder-than-normal air pushing across the Northeast through at least early December.\nAccording to NOAA, the shift is tied to several atmospheric factors: ongoing La Niña conditions, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the potential for a rare November sudden stratospheric warming event. Combined, these patterns may funnel unusually cold air into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., positioning Vermont within the zone of below-normal temperatures.\nWith Vermonters preparing for holiday travel, community events, and early ski-season activities, health officials caution that frostbite and hypothermia can develop faster than many expect—even during brief outdoor exposure.\nSigns of frostbite include:\n• Numbness in the affected area\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Color changes such as red, white, blue, gray, or purple\n• Blisters that may form after rewarming\nTen key signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, slow or shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, drowsiness, very low energy, stumbling movements, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusual lethargy.\nNOAA recommends wearing layered clothing, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors during the coldest periods of the holiday week. Anyone showing symptoms of frostbite or hypothermia should seek immediate medical attention and begin warming using warm—not hot—water or gentle body heat.",
