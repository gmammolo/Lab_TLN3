  "text": "Des Moines, IA – Iowa may face a surge of early-winter cold heading into Thanksgiving week, raising the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook shows a significant pattern shift starting November 25, with colder-than-normal temperatures likely across the central U.S. through early December.\nAccording to NOAA, the incoming cold push is tied to several atmospheric factors, including ongoing La Niña conditions, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the possibility of a rare late-November sudden stratospheric warming event. These influences may help steer Arctic air deep into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., positioning Iowa firmly inside the below-normal temperature zone.\nAs residents prepare for Thanksgiving travel, hunting season, outdoor gatherings, and early holiday shopping, state health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can develop much faster than many expect — especially when wind chills fall below freezing.\nKey frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may appear after rewarming\nTen important signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling or clumsiness, drowsiness, and — in severe cases — loss of consciousness. Infants may present with bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA urges Iowans to bundle in layers, cover exposed skin, and limit outdoor exposure during the coldest periods of the holiday week. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical care and begin warming affected areas with warm — not hot — water or gentle body heat.",
