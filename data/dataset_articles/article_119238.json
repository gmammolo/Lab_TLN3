  "text": "Power outages started for the third night in a row Thursday with lights dying in at least Hagatña, Dededo and Sinajaña after 6 p.m. in line with the load shedding schedule issued by the Guam Power Authority.\nThe Guam Police Department, meanwhile, urged motorists to drive safely and expect congestion in some areas because traffic lights are impacted by power outages.\nIt said the Guam Highway Patrol Division and other units will also be \"conducting traffic checks and direction.\"\nGPA told village mayors that load shedding began on Thursday with peak customer demand of 241 megawatts, while GPA’s capacity was 247.4 MW.\nCustomers were asked to continue to conserve energy between peak demand hours of 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. as demand may still increase through the evening.\nGPA General Manager John Benavente on Wednesday night said Guam would remain vulnerable to load shedding until the Ukudu power plant comes back online on Nov. 24.\nThe plant is down while a generator rotor back from off-island repairs is put back online.\nBenavente said the power authority has to go through the period to get the plant back, and get over load shedding.\nOutages will start at the top of each hour as scheduled, as last resort, GPA has stated. Power should be restored within the hour, once it goes out.\nLoad shedding happens when GPA doesn’t have enough power generation capacity to keep up with customer demand.\nThe power authority on Tuesday indicated that Baseload unit Cabras #1 was offline for repairs and is anticipated to return to service next week.\nMaintenance and repairs to Dededo CT #1 and Piti #7 were scheduled for the weekend, GPA stated.\nUkudu plant\nThe Ukudu power plant was supposed to go fully online by Sept. 30 as part of GPA’s deal with contractor Guam Ukudu Power.\nEvaluations of power authority management also started at the Consolidated Commission on Utilities Tuesday, though GPA General Manager John Benavente is still expected to get his evaluation before year’s end.\nOn Wednesday night, the Public Utilities Commission was scheduled to hold its first public hearing on GPA’s increases to the base rate and a customer fee that will hike the average power bill by an estimated $30.68 starting January or February.\nBenavente Thursday said that additional fuel savings from the Ukudu plant will be close to zeroing out that hike, reducing the actual increase to between 28 cents and $8.12.\nA resolution for the reduced fuel surcharge will be shown to the CCU Thursday.",
