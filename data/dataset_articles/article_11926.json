  "text": "UK rents expected to rise 2% in 2026 amid 'chronic' housing shortage Vicky McKeever · Business reporter Thu, 15 January 2026 at 8:00 am GMT+2 3 min read\nIn this article: London rental properties received an average of seven enquiries in 2025, but the North West and Scotland had more than double this amount at 16. · coldsnowstorm via Getty Images Rightmove ( RMV.L ) predicts that average advertised rents will rise by a further 2% over the course of 2026, as a \"chronic shortage\" of rental homes continues to place pressure on prices.\nThe property website's latest trends tracker, published Thursday, showed that the national average advertised rent of homes outside of London fell by 1.1% in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous three months. That equated to a fall of £15 per month to an average rent of £1,370. This marked only the second time in five years rents had fallen on a quarterly basis.\nAcross the whole of 2025, however, Rightmove ( RMV.L ) found that rents were up 2.2%, or £29, compared to the previous year.\nIn Greater London, the average asking rent was £2,716 in the fourth quarter, which was 0.7% lower compared to the previous three months but 0.8% higher on an annual basis.\nRead more: UK areas tipped for strongest house price growth\nLooking ahead, Rightmove ( RMV.L ) highlighted that there is still a fundamental shortage of rental properties, which the company believed would keep rents ticking higher in 2026.\nRightmove found that the total number of homes available to rent is currently 9% higher than last year, but is 33% lower than 10 years ago.\nAt the same time, the property website said that there are some positive indicators for the future supply of rental homes. For example, it said that the latest snapshot of data from the UK finance trade association, which tracks both remortages and new buy-to-let mortgages, suggests that the rate of rental investment activity is the most positive its been since 2022.\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences. Please update your privacy settings to enable it. In addition, Rightmove ( RMV.L ) said that the competition for rental homes has cooled and is less fierce than during the pandemic. An available rental home received an average of 10 enquiries in 2025, which still higher than an average of six in 2019 pre-pandemic, but is lower than 14 in 2024.\nOn a regional basis, London rental properties received an average of seven enquiries in 2025, but the North West and Scotland had more than double this amount at 16.\nColleen Babcock, property expert at Rightmove ( RMV.L ), said: “There is still a long-term shortage of available rental homes, but it looks like landlords are taking advantage of cheaper available mortgage rates, and more available homes will benefit tenants.\"\n\"Existing tenants or those looking to rent their own home for the first time are likely to experience a much more settled and balanced market than a few years ago, when the competition to secure a home was frenetic,\" she said.\nStory Continues \"There is much greater availability of homes, and fewer tenants to compete with now, which should hopefully make the experience more positive for renters.\"\nRead more:\nThis option is unavailable due to your privacy preferences.
