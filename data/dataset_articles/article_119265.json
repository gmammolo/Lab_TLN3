  "text": "IN THE DISTRICT COURT\nCRIMINAL JURISDICTION\nADELAIDE\nWEDNESDAY, 12 NOVEMBER 2025 AT 9.33 A.M.\nBEFORE HER HONOUR JUDGE DAVISON\nNO.DCCRM-23-043687\nR V JASON SCARCE\nHER HONOUR IN SENTENCING SAID:\nJason Scare, you have pleaded guilty to the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug, the maximum penalty for which is a $50,000 fine or imprisonment for 10 years or both, supplying a category A firearm, the maximum penalty for which is a fine of up to $35,000 or imprisonment for seven years and supplying a category H firearm, the maximum penalty for which is a $50,000 fine or imprisonment for 10 years.\nPursuant to s.40(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act 2017, I may reduce the sentence for each of those offences by up to 5% if I am satisfied there is good reason to do so.\nYou were found guilty of the offence of trafficking in a commercial quantity of a controlled drug. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment, or a fine of $200,000, or both.\nIn terms of your time in custody, you were arrested on 16 March 2023 and released on simple bail. You remained on bail until your bail was revoked on 2 July 2025.\nYou come before this court with no relevant prior offending. In this matter, Mr Caldicott made submissions on your behalf, and I was provided with a number of documents, including a psychological report from Mr Luke Williams dated 14 August 2025, and a number of character references.\nYou are a 50-year-old man who was born in Adelaide to parents who have always worked and instilled a strong work ethic in both you and your sister. You were fortunate to have had a good and happy childhood with the support of your parents. You left school in Year 10, when you were encouraged to apply for a pre-vocational training course at TAFE, where you ultimately gained an apprenticeship in carpentry. You have had a long history of employment after you finished your apprenticeship and appear to have been gainfully employed for most of your adult life. You ran a furniture wholesale business that ultimately progressed to a factory, five shops, a number of warehouses and sheds. You appear to have taken advantage of numerous opportunities as they presented themselves, and the report states that you prided yourself on following up on these opportunities and making the most of them.\nYou met your first wife when you were 16 years old and were together for approximately 20 years. You have a son and a daughter as a result of that relationship. You met your current partner and have now been together for 10 years.\nWhen speaking to Mr Williams about your offending, you had a tendency to downplay the seriousness of the offending and your own involvement in relation to it. I accept that you now genuinely regret your involvement in relation to your offending and the impact that it has had upon other people around you. I accept that you are at low risk of reoffending in the future.\nIt is clear from the references that I have received that you are held in high regard by many people. You are a person who takes the opportunity to assist others when they need help and are a good friend to many. I will take these references into account.\nYour offending is very serious, it was detected during an undercover operation conducted by the South Australia Police in 2022. Two undercover operatives were assigned and had a number of interactions with you over a lengthy period of time. Most of their interactions with you were recorded and transcribed. They rented a shipping container from you at a storage facility that you owned in Londsdale. Those same premises were predominantly used as a storage container facility, but also had a business premises and a residential address.\nThis occurred in August 2021. About a month later, you spoke to one of the operatives in relation to fireworks. You asked him if he was interested in buying some. In October 2021, you sold fireworks to the operatives from the boot of your car in a car park of a hotel in Brighton. In November 2021, you informed the operatives that you had brand-new 9 mm pistols arriving from Queensland. Again, over the months, you spoke about fireworks, and in March 2022, you showed one of the operatives photographs of a black pistol, telling him that two had come in and you needed to think of ways to make money due to issues you were having with your ex-wife.\nIn March 2022, you told the operative that you could ‘hook him up’ with various drugs, including pounds of cannabis. You explained that your role in dealing with pounds of cannabis was in effect as a middleman, facilitating deals and taking a cut from the sale. You said that you would introduce the operatives to a man with pounds of cannabis later. These types of meetings occurred on a regular basis.\nIn October 2022, the operative met with you to provide you with money for the rent of the container. There was again a discussion about fireworks and about cocaine. You also said on that occasion that you could source a pound of cannabis for $2,200.\nOn 26 October 2022, you were asked by one of the operatives if you could help him with a little ‘bit of green’, specifically six pounds. You then made a phone call to an associate and told him you needed ‘six big ones for tonight.’ You informed the operatives that only two pounds were available that night, but the rest could be sourced later. You told them the price. About 13 minutes later, a man named Andrew Osborne, known as Ozzy, pulled up in your yard. He showed the operatives two pounds of cannabis that were in his car and said he could organise four more the next day. Later that afternoon, the operatives purchased the two pounds of cannabis and paid $4,600. The two bags contained 444 g and 442 g of cannabis, respectively. This sale is the basis of count 1, the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug.\nThat night, you left a voicemail on the operative's mobile phone, checking that everything went all right. An arrangement was made for a further three pounds of cannabis to be handed over two days later. On 28 October, Ozzy sold the undercover operatives an additional three pounds of cannabis for the sum of $7,100. This is the subject of Count 2.\nYou were present when this transaction occurred, although not in the same place as it occurred. Whilst the transaction was taking place, one of the undercover operatives and you spoke about the purchase of a rifle. This was a .22 rifle. This rifle was handed over to the undercover operatives from Ozzy's vehicle in a nearby location in exchange for $3,000. This is the subject of count 3 on the information.\nOn 10 November, one of the operatives called you and organised a meeting to purchase another firearm. The undercover operatives attended the Lonsdale premises and were met by you. You reached into your car and pulled out a black metallic firearm that resembled a submachine gun. One of the operatives gave you $1,200 in cash to purchase the firearm. He also gave you $100 as a delivery fee for the previous firearm purchased on 28 October.\nThe two offences in relation to supplying a firearm both constitute serious firearms offences pursuant to the Sentencing Act. As such, a term of imprisonment must be imposed that cannot be suspended. You have not sought to satisfy me that your personal circumstances are so exceptional as to outweigh the paramount consideration of protecting the safety of the community and personal and general deterrence, and that, in all the circumstances, it is appropriate to suspend that sentence.\nAs a consequence of then needing to impose a sentence that is not suspended, and as the balance of the offences are serious offences that attract a term of imprisonment, these too cannot be suspended. You are therefore liable to be sentenced as a serious repeat offender if you have committed and been convicted of at least three serious offences committed on separate occasions. The question that must be answered in this case is whether there are three separate occasions.\nIt has not been argued that the offence that was committed on 26 October 2022 constitutes one offence, and the supply of the category H firearm on 10 October constituted a second offence. The question is whether counts 2 and 3, both having been committed on 28 October 2022, constitute at least one further occasion or whether they should be regarded as having been committed on the same occasion as the first offence. This situation was considered in R v Harradine by the Court of Appeal.\nIn sentencing your co-offender, Ozzy, Judge Handshin summarised the effect of this case. He said the Court of Appeal had identified in this case a number of facts and circumstances that affect whether offences can be said to have been committed on the same or separate occasions.\nAmongst other things reference was made to the degree of contemporaneity between the offences, the distance between the places where the offences are committed, the degree of similarity and the nature of the offences or underlying conduct, the circumstantial relationship between the offences, the offender's reasons for committing the offences and the opportunity the offender had to reflect on the conduct between the offences and the nature of the preparatory conduct engaged in between each offence.\nIn short, he said, if there is a temporal separation or a separation in circumstances between offences, they may be described as having occurred on separate occasions. Ultimately, questions of fact and degree will inform this assessment.\nThe circumstances of the two cannabis offences can, in my mind, be viewed as one occasion. The undercover operatives made the request to purchase six pounds of cannabis. On 26 October, two pounds were available, and then on 28 October, a further three pounds became available. I have no difficulty in determining that the two transactions in respect of the cannabis should be regarded as one occasion.\nHowever, it was while the transaction was being undertaken by Ozzy that you introduced the notion of the purchase of the .22 rifle. Although there had been discussion earlier about the purchase of a firearm, this was in no sense a part of the cannabis deal. It was not linked in any way, it seems, to the cannabis transaction. It was not a transaction that was already on foot on 28 October that was simply being completed on that day, as was the case with the cannabis transaction.\nEven accepting that the same players were involved in relation to both transactions, they were completely separate in nature. However, the fact that they did occur at the same time as the cannabis transaction is an important feature. In your case, it is finely balanced. I find that there is merit in both of the arguments that have been put to this court.\nI consider that although the introduction of the sale of the firearm on this day constituted a different offence, they were temporally linked such that they can properly be described as having occurred on the same occasion with the trafficking that occurred on 28 October. You are therefore not a serious repeat offender having committed or been convicted of at least three serious offences committed on at least three separate occasions.\nI now turn to sentence. Your role in relation to this offending is that of principal offender. In respect of the cannabis you sourced the cannabis, you organised the sale of the cannabis and acted as a middleman in relation to it. You provided the premises on which the transactions took place. You ensured that there was a degree of secrecy in relation to the transactions in order to avoid detection. You did this by warning the participants in relation to the presence of others and by providing the containers in which the transactions could take place away from prying eyes.\nI propose to fix a single sentence pursuant to s.26 of the Sentencing Act, however, I will first identify notional sentences. In sentencing you, I have had regard to the submissions made by your counsel, all of the materials received, the circumstances of the offending and s.44 of the Controlled Substances Act.\nThe paramount consideration of the court is the protection of the public. Deterrence of both of you and others is also significant. The sale of drugs in this state, including cannabis, is a highly organised business. It requires a number of different roles to be fulfilled in order to work efficiently.\nYour role was multifaceted. You had, over a lengthy period, let it be known that you had the capacity to source drugs. You spoke in terms that suggested you were experienced in relation to the drug trade. You are not to be sentenced for that, but it is a relevant circumstance. You, when asked, sourced the cannabis, made the introduction, provided safe premises and profited from the transactions.\nThe quantity of cannabis that was being traded is also significant. It was being sold in pound lots, indicating that it was not for personal use but rather part of a commercial enterprise. The only appropriate penalty is a term of imprisonment.\nFor the offence of trafficking in cannabis on 26 October 2022, I would have sentenced you to a term of imprisonment of three years and nine months. I reduce that on account of your plea of guilty to three years, six months and 23 days. For the offence of trafficking in a commercial quantity on 28 October, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of four years and nine months. These sentences are to be served concurrently.\nIn respect of the offence of supplying a category A firearm, as I have said, this was committed on the same day as the offence of trafficking in a commercial quantity of a controlled drug, but it constitutes a separate offence. There can be no doubt that supplying illegal firearms constitutes serious offending. These firearms often fall into the hands of inexperienced individuals ill-equipped to use them safely. They are used to commit other criminal offences or threaten or intimidate. It goes without saying that the consequences of their illegal use can be fatal. You supplied a .22 Winchester Magnum rimfire calibre lever-action rifle. You organised for the person 'Ozzy' to get the firearm and to provide it to the undercover operatives. You organised for this to be done away from the safehouse to minimise the risk of detection. In relation to this offence, I would have imposed a term of imprisonment of two years, but for your plea of guilty, I reduce it to one year, 10 months and 25 days.\nIn respect of the offence of supplying the category H firearm, you were paid $1200 in cash for this firearm. This is a firearm that is sometimes referred to as a gel blaster. I consider a term of imprisonment of two years, and three months would have been appropriate, but for your plea of guilty, I reduce it to two years, one month, and 20 days. I make an order that the sentences in respect of the firearms be served concurrently.\nThis is a head sentence then of six years, 10 months, and 20 days. In setting your non-parole period, I take into account your personal circumstances, including your lack of prior offending, and the circumstances of the offending. I set a non-parole period of three years and six months. The sentence cannot be suspended, home detention is not a suitable option. The sentence will commence on the day you went into custody, being 2 July 2025.\nI order forfeiture of the drugs and the firearms.\nIs there anything further?\nMS WILKINSON: No, thank you.\nHER HONOUR: Ms Cousins?\nMS COUSINS: No, thank you.\nADJOURNED 9.53 A.M.\nDISCLAIMER - Every effort has been made to comply with suppression orders or statutory provisions prohibiting publication that may apply to this judgment.
