  "text": "Hamilton’s Club Absinthe shuts its doors amid rent dispute\nClub Absinthe on Hess Street South in Hamilton is closed due to the lease being terminated for nonpayment of rent.\nThee club has only been at this location on Hess Street for less than a year, and there were a number of events coming up inside the club – but the doors are now locked.\n“Some of the biggest and best parties Hamilton ever saw were at Absinthe, so it’s really sad that it’s gone,” said event planner Steven Hilliard.\nHilliard has a long history with Club Absinthe. His events company House of Adam and Steve hosted many events inside the club.\n“Very long history in the community. I think the original Absinthe opened like 20 years ago. Its original location on King Street was iconic. That basement, I think everyone in their university years spent Motown Wednesdays in the Absinthe basement,” said Hilliard.\nBut now the club has been given a notice for not paying rent. A letter posted on the door of the venue dated Jan. 9 says the tenant has until 5 p.m. on Thursday to remove everything inside.\nGregory King’s band Wellington TrebleHook was scheduled to perform at the club at the end of this month\n“I signed a contract that we were going to play Sunday, Jan. 25. And then a few days ago one of the bands found out that this place shut down and they didn’t let me know. First of all, I had to pay a $300 fee to play the show. Now I’m out $300,” said King.\nThe new location of Absinthe has been on Hess Street for less than a year, after moving from its last location at the corner of King William and Hughson Street.\n“If they had at least reached out to me and told me what was going on — and I would like my deposit back,” said Hilliard.\n“It’s an iconic venue. It’s a sad loss for the community,” said Hilliard.\nCHCH News did reach out to both the club owners and the landlord for comment but have not heard back.\nWATCH MORE: Hamilton’s Club Absinthe has lease terminated for non-payment of rent",
