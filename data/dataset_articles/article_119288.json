  "text": "Multiple counties across the U.S. have been issued winter storm warnings by the National Weather Service (NWS), as some could face up to a foot of snow overnight Wednesday through Thursday and into Friday.\nWhy it Matters\nThe NWS has warned that heavy snowfall and—in some cases—blustery, high winds could “cause hazardous travel conditions” and has urged drivers in affected areas to “slow down and use caution” if they must venture out.\nWhat To Know\nForecasters are predicting that large parts of Alaska are likely to be hit with heavy snow and high winds from Wednesday night. Specifically, Klondike Highway, particularly near White Pass, could get up to 1 foot of snow by early Friday morning. St Lawrence Island (which could see up to 1 inch of snowfall per hour overnight on Wednesday), the Interior Seward Peninsula, Bering Strait Coast, and Diomede could get up to 6 inches and between 40 to 50 mph winds—causing reduced visibility due to blowing snow and blizzard-like conditions. The Kuskokwim Delta might see between 3 and 6 inches of snow, coupled with 35 mph winds, and inland Bristol Bay and northern Bristol Bay Coast could be hit with 8 inches of snow and 40 mph winds, lasting until Thursday afternoon.\nIn California, the northern Ventura County Mountains could see up to 6 inches above 6,000 feet, and Mono County could get up to 12 inches in areas above 7,000 feet, with 18 inches expected on the highest peaks and 80 mph winds along the Sierra crest, lasting until Friday morning.\nAreas above 10,000 feet in the eastern San Juan Mountains, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and Pikes Peak, in Colorado, could get between 4 and 8 inches by Thursday night into Friday morning.\nThe northern and southern Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the Tusas Mountains—including Chama—and the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico could get up to 7 inches above 8,500 feet, and up to 10 inches on the highest peaks by Friday morning.\nIn Nevada, the Spring Mountains might get up to 7 inches above 6,000 feet, and the Mineral and Southern Lyon Counties should prepare for between 4 and 8 inches above 7,000 feet and up to 1 foot along the highest peaks, with winds gusting as high as 60 mph, until Friday morning. The NWS has warned that Anchorite on Highway 359 and Montgomery on US Highway 6 are likely to be the hardest hit areas.\nWhat People Are Saying\nThe NWS has issued this advice: “If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.”\nIt also explains that: “A Winter Weather Advisory means that periods of snow, sleet, or freezing rain will cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for slippery roads and limited visibility, and use caution while driving.”\nWhat Happens Next\nThe NWS urges residents and travelers in affected areas to closely monitor their local forecasts and travel advisories, as conditions may change rapidly. They should also prepare emergency kits for their homes and vehicles and delay or adjust travel plans to make sure they remain safe.",
