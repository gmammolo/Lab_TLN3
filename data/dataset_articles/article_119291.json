  "text": "At 1:53 a.m. on Thursday, the National Weather Service issued an updated dense fog advisory, affecting Northern Centre and Southern Centre, as well as Elk, Cameron, Clearfield, Cambria, Blair, Somerset, and Bedford counties. The advisory warns residents that visibility could drop to a quarter-mile or less due to the dense fog conditions. The weather service also cautions that a light glaze of ice, particularly on bridges and overpasses, may contribute to hazardous driving conditions.\nDrivers are advised to exercise extreme caution in these low-visibility circumstances, which can create dangerous road conditions. The National Weather Service emphasizes the importance of slowing down, using low-beam headlights, and maintaining ample distance from other vehicles when traveling in fog.\nFor those in areas affected by the dense fog advisory, safety tips include:\nReduce Speed: It is crucial to slow down and allow for additional travel time to ensure a safe journey.\nVisibility Priority: Use low-beam headlights to enhance your visibility to other drivers. This also activates your vehicle’s taillights. If equipped, utilize fog lights.\nAvoid High-Beams: High-beam headlights can create glare that diminishes visibility further, making driving more hazardous.\nKeep a Safe Distance: Maintain a considerable following distance to accommodate sudden stops or changes in traffic.\nStay in Your Lane: Utilize the road’s lane markings as a reference to help you stay on course.\nZero Visibility Protocol: In instances of near-zero visibility, turn on your hazard lights and find a safe location, such as a parking lot, to pull over until conditions improve.\nNo Parking Options: If no parking or driveways are available, pull as far off the road as possible. Once stopped, turn off all lights except for your hazard lights, engage the emergency brake, and release the brake pedal to avoid illuminating the taillights, which could mislead other drivers. By adhering to these recommendations from the National Weather Service, individuals can navigate through foggy conditions more safely, thereby decreasing the likelihood of accidents and enhancing overall safety on the roads.",
