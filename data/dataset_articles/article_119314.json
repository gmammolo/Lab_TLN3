  "text": "Schools closed and roads blocked as snow falls\nSchools are closed and traffic has come to a standstill as parts of north-east England are blanketed with snow.\nMost of the region is under a Met Office yellow warning for snow and ice until 21:00 GMT, with frequent wintry showers and significant snow build-up expected.\nDozens of schools have closed their doors with some saying conditions on the roads are unsafe for staff and students.\nMeanwhile, traffic has also been been disrupted by the weather, including on the A1 in Northumberland between Morpeth and Alnwick, which came to a standstill as HGVs blocked the road.\n\"As a result of the snow there are currently two HGVs that are blocking the carriageway,\" National Highways said, adding there were delays heading northbound.\nLockwood Primary School in Saltburn closed, saying conditions on the roads around it were getting worse.\nMeanwhile, the headteacher at Duchess's Community High School in Alnwick, Northumberland, shut the school saying he tried to get into the town by various routes but it was becoming increasingly unsafe to do so.\nPublic transport was affected too.\nArriva North East said the 81 between Kirkleatham Village and Guisborough was unable to run because vehicles were getting stuck on the bank on the B1269 near Dunsdale.\nFollow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram.",
