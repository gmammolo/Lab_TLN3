  "text": "HCMC – Persistent heavy rains over recent weeks have flooded large vegetable-growing areas across HCMC, damaging crops and sharply reducing output. As a result, farm-gate and market prices for leafy greens have surged. Even fields that escaped direct inundation suffered significant losses, as strong, continuous rain has battered plants and hindered growth. Key vegetable-producing zones in the city are reporting a steep decline in harvest volumes.\nThe supply shortage has quickly spilled over to local markets. Farm-gate prices for mustard greens and similar leafy vegetables have risen to VND18,000–20,000 per kilogram, lettuce to VND30,000 per kilogram, and spring onions to around VND35,000 per kilogram. During the same period last year, these items typically sold for just VND2,000–5,000 per kilogram.\nDespite the higher prices, growers say the gains offer little relief. Lower yields, increased crop losses, and rising seed costs have eroded profits.\nAccording to the HCMC Department of Industry and Trade, 60–70% of vegetables supplied to central-city markets come from neighboring provinces. Prolonged adverse weather has disrupted not only production but also market supply and demand, affecting consumer purchasing behavior.\nIn response, the department has advised residents to buy from reputable retailers and supermarkets where prices are more stable. It also plans to work with localities and major suppliers to increase shipments to the city and prevent prolonged price volatility.\nTags vegetable prices",
