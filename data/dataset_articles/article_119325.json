  "text": "Representative Image VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh is bracing up for another cyclone as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal on November 22 (Saturday). The weather system is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a depression over central parts of south Bay of Bengal around Nov 24. The weather experts anticipate that the system may further strengthen into a cyclonic storm over the southwest Bay of Bengal, potentially setting the state for another wet spell over coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) as well as Rayalaseema from Nov 26 to 29. One Dead, Thousands Evacuated as Cyclone Montha Tears Through Andhra and Odisha If the low-pressure-area intensified into a cyclone, the season’s second cyclone storm would move closer to the Andhra Pradesh coast. It may be recalled that severe cyclonic storm Montha on October 28 and 29 this year left a trail of destruction in parts of Andhra Pradesh, leaving two persons dead and inundating agricultural crops over 80,000 hectares, damaging roads and culverts. The severe cyclonic storm crossed the Andhra Pradesh and Yanam coasts close to Narsapuram in Andhra Pradesh on Oct 29. Ahead of the system’s intensification, the weathermen have advised the farmers to complete harvest works as the farmers have suffered losses in the recent October rains. Meanwhile, cold weather conditions continue to grip the tribal pockets in the Alluri Sitharama Raju (ASR) district, where residents are shivering under plummeting temperatures. On Thursday (Nov 20), Chintapalle recorded a minimum temperature of 9.5°C — the second lowest of the season so far. It may be recalled that Chintapalle recorded 6.8°C on Wednesday (Nov 19).\nAbout the Author Nalla Ram Babu Nalla Ram Babu is a Special Correspondent, at the Times of India-Visakhapatnam.
