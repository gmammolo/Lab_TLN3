  "text": "Lea Zmurko: Filled in with fog as a dreary day wears on\nIt is tough to see out the door this morning with grey skies and ongoing precipitation carrying across in the early morning. Visibility is hindered for those navigating the roads with a dense fog sprawled about. Areas across east central Minnesota and northern Wisconsin see visibility has fallen and clouds stay close to the surface into daybreak.\nThis light rain and drizzle will start wrapping up mid-morning and by the early afternoon a cold front makes an entrance. Skies will gradually clear in the early evening and overnight a few flakes could even be found as they use up that last bit of moisture along the northern border. No significant accumulation of snow will be recorded by Friday morning, but those areas of higher elevation could see a dusting.\nThe weekend remains dry now with some cloud coverage on Saturday but next week another shift Is expected. Cooler conditions will be coming through with a winter-like twist. There is still a mixed message on the chance for precipitation as well as what type of precip could be expected. The cold air is something we see confidence in by Turkey Day that will carry into the beginning of December. The chance for precipitation still has some wavering interpretations currently, but we will be certain to see cold air settling across the Upper Midwest region.\nToday\nA chance of drizzle, mainly before 10am. Areas of fog before 11am. Otherwise, mostly cloudy, with a high near 41. West wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph.\nTonight\nMostly cloudy, then gradually becoming mostly clear, with a low around 25. West wind around 10 mph, with gusts as high as 20 mph.\nFriday\nSunny, with a high near 37. Northwest wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 15 mph.\nSaturday\nPartly sunny, with a high near 42. Southwest wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 15 mph.\nSunday\nMostly sunny, with a high near 44. West wind 5 to 10 mph, with gusts as high as 15 mph.\nMonday\nMostly sunny, with a high near 44. Southwest wind around 5 mph becoming south in the afternoon.\nTuesday\nA chance of rain. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 41. South wind around 10 mph becoming west in the afternoon. Winds could gust as high as 20 mph.\nWednesday\nA slight chance of snow. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 30. Breezy, with a west wind around 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph.",
