  "text": "More than 50 schools shut as snow causes disruption\nSchools across mid and west Wales have shut as snow and ice cause disruption.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning, and some areas could see up to 10cm of snow, particularly on higher ground, with a wider risk of icy surfaces making travel hazardous.\nMore than 30 schools have shut in Pembrokeshire, seven in Ceredigion and 14 in Carmarthenshire.\nThe National Grid said hundreds of properties in Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire were without power.\nDrivers and pedestrians are being urged to check conditions before travelling and be prepared for forecasts to change through the day.\nDyfed-Powys Police have reported the road from Templeton to Tavernspite is shut, and poor driving conditions on the A40 St Clears to Haverfordwest.\nThe B4329, Preseli Road, between Tafarn-y-bwlch and New Inn is impassable and remains closed.\nThe yellow snow and ice warning covers:\nCarmarthenshire\nCeredigion\nPembrokeshire\nSwansea\nSchool closures\nPeople have been told to keep updated on council website for school closure updates.\nDriving in the snow\nCouncillor Shon Rees told BBC Radio Wales that parts of Pembrokeshire are experiencing \"very very deep snow\" with some areas seeing up to 10 inches.\nHe said the snow has persisted this morning and that driving conditions across the north of the county remain \"very difficult\".\nSnow ploughs have been working through the area, and he said he had been helping a lorry free that became stuck in the snow as efforts continue to keep key routes open.\nRees said schools and the local authorities are taking the conditions seriously, adding that he thought it was the right decision for them to close.\nDrivers are advised to leave extra time to prepare their vehicles, and carry essentials such as warm clothing, food, water, a blanket, a torch and a phone charger in case of delays.\nThose heading out on foot are encouraged to use pavements along main roads, which are more likely to have been treated, to reduce the risk of slips and falls on icy surfaces.\nCyclists are also advised to stick to main routes for the same reason.\nHouseholds are being reminded to prepare for any short power cuts by keeping torches, spare batteries and a mobile pack ready.\nThe Met Office has warned that weather warnings can change quickly and recommends people keep up to date with the latest forecasts.",
