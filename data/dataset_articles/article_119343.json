  "text": "Formula 1 drivers are concerned about the forecasts of rain for this weekend’s Las Vegas Grand Prix.\nThe event typically sees some of the lowest temperatures of the season. That plus its low-grip surface would make a wet race particularly challenging.F1 has not encountered rain during either of its two visits to the Las Vegas Strip Circuit. However heavy rain has fallen in Las Vegas in recent days – the nearby airport has received over a third of its average yearly rainfall since Saturday – and more is expected during the grand prix weekend.\nFernando Alonso said wet sessions in the night at the high-speed, low-grip track would be “not fun at all.”\n“It’s fast, visibility is going to be a challenge, I think, under the lights,” he explained “Also the grip level I think is very low already on dry [tyres]. Temperature is low, so it could be fun to watch but not to drive.”\nForecasts indicate an above-average chance of rain during Thursday’s second practice session and a lower risk of more rain on Friday. The grand prix on Saturday is expected to be dry.\nChampionship leader Lando Norris said he is hoping the weekend stays dry.\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and\n“From what I’m aware of, [it] is just going to rain on Thursday and a bit into Friday for maybe FP3,” he said. “But I think Saturday in qualifying should be fine so I don’t think it’ll affect us too much.\n“I think it’ll be an incredibly difficult track in the rain. Pretty nasty, I think. It’s going to be a hell of a challenge.\n“Obviously [there’s] not a lot of room for error. It’s quite tricky and quite quick in terms of being a street circuit. You’ve got the white lines, all the paint and stuff – it’s pretty horrible at times when you’re in the car feeling these kinds of things.\n“So it will be a pretty insane challenge, I think, if it stays wet. Especially if it doesn’t dry very quickly either because of the temperature. So I’m excited for both, but I prefer if it’s dry.”\nGeorge Russell, who won last year’s race, is especially keen for it to remain dry. “Every time it rains it offers an opportunity,” he explained. “Ordinarily speaking, you’re ready for that opportunity, always.\n“Of course, for us, if we were to pinpoint one race on the calendar where we think we can fight for victory, this would be the race. So out of all of the races I would choose for this one not to be wet.”\nAdvert | Become a RaceFans supporter and\n“It’s going to be very cold, the tyres will be difficult to switch on,” he added. “Street track, white lines, a bit bumpy in sections, so it’ll catch people out and you’ve just got to make sure you’re not one of them.”\nHowever Max Verstappen sees a potential upside to rain early in the weekend, but admitted he’s “not looking forward to” driving on a wet track this weekend.\n“I prefer to just have a dry race,” he said. “It’s already hard enough, I guess, to get everything working here or understanding at least something. So I prefer it a bit more straightforward.\n“But if the track floods, maybe less practice, it’s also not a bad thing.”\nMiss nothing from RaceFans\nGet a daily email with all our latest stories - and nothing else.
