  "text": "Mumbai residents awoke Thursday to a rare chill in the air, a welcome departure from the city’s relentless humidity that evoked the first whispers of winter. Clear blue skies stretched overhead as early risers navigated light breezes and temperatures that plunged under 20 degrees Celsius before sunrise, marking one of the most invigorating starts to the day this season.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) anticipates this respite will persist, with mostly sunny conditions prevailing through the afternoon. Highs are projected to climb to 33–34 degrees Celsius, while lows could settle around 17°C, especially in the northern suburbs where cooler pockets often emerge. This modest drop signals a gentle shift in the weather pattern over the next day, though no dramatic changes loom on the horizon.\nYet, the morning’s allure was tempered by a stubborn veil of haze that dulled the urban vista. Visibility dipped in pockets across the metropolis, with the faint smog softening silhouettes of towering structures and casting a muted pall over the landscape. Though a soft wind provided fleeting comfort, it fell short of scattering the airborne particles, robbing the scene of its full crispness.\nIMD readings captured the city’s climatic contrasts vividly. Colaba, in the south, logged a milder minimum of 22 degrees Celsius alongside 70 percent relative humidity. In contrast, Santacruz’s gauge in the suburbs clocked a brisker 17.2 degrees Celsius and drier air at 56 percent humidity—highlighting the subtle gradients that define Mumbai’s diverse microclimates.\nALSO READ : Real Estate Agent Gunned Down in Mumbai Suburb, Sparks Urgent Police Hunt\nAmid these meteorological nuances, air pollution cast a long shadow. The Central Pollution Control Board’s SAMEER app pegged the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 143 early Thursday, firmly in the ‘moderate’ range—a level that, while not dire, serves as a persistent red flag. The lingering mist, which began to dissipate with rising temperatures, points to deeper woes exacerbated by slack winds and atmospheric stagnation, a recurring winter affliction.\nAs untroubled skies hold steady without incoming fronts to stir the pot, Mumbaikars may savor more such tolerable dawns ahead. Still, vigilance over air quality is essential, as seasonal pollutants show little sign of yielding ground.",
