  "text": "Virginia faced with 20 inches of brutal snowfall this winter, thanks to La Nina\nAs winter approaches, Virginia's weather watchers are on edge, as a barrage of snow could transform the state's typical winter landscape.\nVirginia is not well-known for its high snowfall overall, but parts of the state could experience a significant amount this winter, according to some forecasters. While worldpopulationreview.com states that the overall average snowfall in the state was 0.78 in 2023, this year could see much higher numbers.\nIn the DC area, however, which includes the District of Columbia and the surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia, the average snowfall is more like 13.7. Of December, January, and February, January is expected to have the most snowfall.\nFirst Alert Weather is anticipating between 15 and 20 inches of snowfall in Leesburg, Virginia, this winter, which is located in the DC area, specifically in the northwestern part of the state.\nHowever, forecasters are having difficulty predicting snowfall this year, due to La Niña. The La Niña pattern typically affects the jet stream in a way that leads to increased precipitation in the northern parts of the U.S., while promoting warmer and drier conditions in the Southern Regions.\nLa Nina predictions as Virginia brace for heavy snowfall\n“It doesn’t take very much in terms of fluctuation of weather patterns, a jet stream that’s maybe a little more south of there, to give us that wet weather,” 7News First Alert Chief Meteorologist Veronica Johnson said as per WTOP news.\n“And what we’re looking at then this year … is going with conditions that were similar to last year.”\nJohnson warned of coastal storms merging into one large storm, which forecasters will have to monitor, especially given the position of the jet stream.\n“If that jet stream comes in and hugs the coast, and you’ve got some coastal storms that are tracking right along it up the coast, that could be your 5-10 inches in one storm during January. And I do think that it’s still going to be active during February.”\nMeanwhile, weather experts are urging Americans to closely monitor forecasts this week and next, in time for the Thanksgiving holiday.\nIt’s essential to review travel advisories well in advance of any trips, particularly for those heading north, where weather patterns are likely to shift. During the holidays, about 90% of travelers are expected to drive to their destinations.\nDuring Thanksgiving, however, Virginia is currently expected to be bright and cool overall, but that could change as it’s still a week away!",
