  "text": "Massive flooding criples traffic in central Vietnam By Staff reporters Thu 11/20/2025, 01:37 am (PT) Widespread flooding has paralyzed traffic and left numerous drivers stranded on National Highway 1A, particularly across sections running through Gia Lai, Dak Lak, and Khanh Hoa provinces. By noon on Thursday, thousands of vehicles remained trapped at Ngoc Hoi Junction in central Khanh Hoa Province, where the North–South railway intersects with 23 Thang 10 Street (National Highway 1C) and 19 Thang 5 Street. The deep flooding in this area, caused by heavy rain and rising floodwaters, stalled numerous cars and completely halted traffic. Floodwaters sweeping across the tracks near Nha Trang have led to the suspension of the entire North–South railway line in provinces affected by heavy rain and flooding. Early Thursday morning, a bus traveling from Ho Chi Minh City to Quang Ngai Province carrying 33 people was swept off National Highway 1A by surging floodwaters in Dien Khanh Commune, Khanh Hoa Province. Rescuers are currently on the scene working to save the passengers and recover the 40-seat vehicle. Heavy rain combined with dam releases caused severe flooding in Gia Lai Province, blocking traffic for 15 kilometers on National Highway 1 throughout Monday morning. Vehicles were only able to start moving slowly after 11 a.m. Amid the stalled traffic, many drivers exited their vehicles and waited for the floodwaters to recede. To cope with the wait, some passengers and bus staff boil water to eat instant noodles right on their vehicles. Floodwaters submerged the national highway in Dong Hoa Commune of Dak Lak Province.",
