Overnight downpours in Khanh Hoa province submerge many areas. (Photo: Thai Binh/VOV-Tay Nguyen) Heavy rains on Wednesday caused widespread inundation and flash floods in parts of Khanh Hoa province. Soldiers from Commando Brigade 5 helped evacuate dozens of people from deeply flooded areas in West Nha Trang ward on Thursday. Naval Region 4 and the Vietnam Naval Academy deployed more than 300 troops, canoes, motorboats, high-chassis trucks, cranes, and essential supplies to Suoi Hiep, Tay Nha Trang, Cam Lam, Cam Hiep, and Suoi Dau ward overnight. Troops and local forces are racing against time, conducting rescue work and helping residents stabilize their lives. Troops from Commando Brigade 5 reinforce the Nuoc Ngot Reservoir dam in Khanh Hoa province. (Photo: Thai Binh/VOV–Tay Nguyen) In Dak Lak province, Military Region 5 has set up forward command posts for rescue missions. Prolonged heavy rains have caused subsidence and road fractures in Lam Dong province, cutting off access to a section of the Mimosa Pass connecting Duc Trong with Da Lat. Other routes into Da Lat, including D’ran Pass and Prenn Pass, were also closed due to landslides. Da Nang city’s Military Command has given hundreds of life jackets and specialized equipment for airdrops to affected areas in Gia Lai and Dak Lak province. Troops from the Naval Academy arrive at Dien Dien Commune at midnight to conduct rescue operations.
