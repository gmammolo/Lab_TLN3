  "text": "Translate\nAntigua, Guatemala (104.2 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / Very weak shaking (MMI II) / horizontal (sideways) swinging / 1-2 s : It felt like the earth doing a little shimmy or hoop dance. I could almost see my room swaying right and left though it was also reeeally gentle. Yet still I heard sirens afterwards. It’s just shook again a couple times a little bit, a couple minutes later, it’s weird, almost like a fractal, little tiny aftershocks of a little earthquake, and a couple minutes later the earth is still shaking once in a while very subtly without making any noise. There was a little noise the first time. Then in between those shocks there were even more barely perceptible ones. | One user found this interesting.\nIzalco, Sonsonate Department (75.9 km E of epicenter) [Map] / Weak shaking (MMI III) / rattling, vibrating / very short : It was short | One user found this interesting.\nChinautla, Guatemala (112 km N of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nJaco, Garabito, Puntarenas Province (770.8 km SE of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nSan Salvador (127.5 km E of epicenter) [Map] / not felt : Any\nMixco, Municipio de Mixco, Guatemala (107.6 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nSanta Catarina Pinula, Guatemala (100.2 km N of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nSantiago Sacatepequez (109.1 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nVilla Nueva, Guatemala (97.1 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / Weak shaking (MMI III) / single lateral shake / 20-30 s : Estaba sentada\nAntigua (122 km NW of epicenter) [Map] / Very weak shaking (MMI II) / horizontal (sideways) swinging / 2-5 s : I was laying in bed\nAntigua guatemala (102.1 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / Weak shaking (MMI III) / very short\nGuatemala City (104.6 km N of epicenter) [Map] / not felt (reported through\nour app)\nAntigua Guatemala, Sacatepéquez (105.1 km NNW of epicenter) [Map] / Weak shaking (MMI III) (reported through",
