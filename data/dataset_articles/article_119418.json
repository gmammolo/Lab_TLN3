  "text": "Texas wakes to a volatile sky as lightning flickers along the western horizon and low clouds churn over the Metroplex. Streets glisten under steady rainfall, and the humid air carries the unmistakable tension of strengthening storms. Early Thanksgiving travelers will need to stay alert today—conditions shift quickly and could disrupt routes across I-20, I-30, and I-35W.\nA Flood Watch remains in effect, and the ground is already saturated. Two rounds of heavy rain continue, the first ongoing this morning and the second expected this afternoon and evening. Urban areas, low-lying roads, and poor-drainage spots will flood fastest. Drivers should plan for delays, reduced visibility, and temporary closures, especially during the mid-day and early-evening surge.\nStrong thunderstorms also push through northern and central portions of the Metroplex with winds over 30 mph. Gusts could blow loose objects and snap small tree limbs. Lightning will extend along a corridor from Azle to Benbrook to Godley as storms race east at nearly 45 mph. Torrential rainfall may further slow travel, and conditions may worsen rapidly as the heaviest cells track across Tarrant, Parker, Johnson, Wise, and northern Ellis counties.\nFor now, temperatures stay warm and humid, but a gradual clearing arrives Friday. Sunshine breaks through with a high near 77, offering a brief calm for travelers. Saturday stays mostly sunny and mild, ideal for early holiday errands before clouds return Sunday along with another chance of showers.\nNationally, meteorologists are closely watching a developing winter pattern between November 25 and December 3, with potential heavy snow across the Northwest, Plains, Midwest, and into parts of the East. Those traveling long-distance for Thanksgiving should monitor updates closely.\nFive-Day Outlook\nFriday: Sunny, high 77.\nSaturday: Mostly sunny, high 71.\nSunday: Showers likely, high 71.\nMonday: Mostly clear, high 72.\nTuesday: Sunny, high 71.",
