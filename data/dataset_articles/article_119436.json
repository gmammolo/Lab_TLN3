  "text": "Next Article\nSnowstorm shuts down schools and roads in northeast England\nIndia\nA major snowstorm swept through northeast England on Thursday, leading to school closures and travel chaos.\nThe Met Office put out a yellow warning for snow and ice until 9pm.\nSeveral schools, like Lockwood Primary in Saltburn, had to close, while the headteacher at Duchess's Community High School said he tried to get into town by various routes but it was becoming increasingly unsafe to do so.\nTravel delays hit hard\nThe A1 between Morpeth and Alnwick is jammed up with trucks blocking the road, causing long delays.\nPublic transport isn't spared either—Arriva North East's service 81 had to be suspended because busses kept getting stuck near Dunsdale.\nAll in all, it's been a rough day for getting around or heading to class in the region.",
