  "text": "On Thursday at 5:21 a.m. a freezing fog advisory was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 9 a.m. for Crawford County.\nThe weather service adds to anticipate, \"Visibility one quarter mile or less in freezing fog.\"\n\"Low visibility and a light glaze of ice, especially on bridges and overpasses could make driving conditions hazardous,\" explains the weather service. \"If driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of distance ahead of you.\"\nWhat does a freezing fog advisory mean? When a freezing fog advisory is in effect, it indicates that fog is developing while surface temperatures hover at or dip below the freezing point. In such conditions, the minuscule liquid droplets within the fog can instantaneously freeze upon contact with various surfaces, including vehicles and roadways. Freezing fog poses heightened risks for driving, boating, flying, and other modes of transportation. Typically, visibilities plummet to a mile or less.\nWhat is a freezing fog?\nFreezing fog, a close cousin to ice, forms the same way as regular fog. Both fog and freezing fog start when the skies are clear, heat radiates into space, and as a result, the Earth's surface cools down. As this cooling progresses, the air's capacity to retain moisture decreases, triggering the condensation of water vapor into minuscule liquid droplets — the essential components of fog. When this fog forms in sub-zero temperatures, its water droplets remain in liquid form, a phenomenon known as \"Supercooling\". In essence, supercooling occurs when a liquid, despite being below its freezing point, remains in a liquid state due to the absence of a freezing surface.\nWhen these supercooled droplets encounter surfaces, they undergo a remarkable transformation, crystallizing into delicate ice structures known as rime. This transformation is often visible on vertical surfaces exposed to prevailing winds, as well as on trees, plants, and other elements in the environment. In fact, rime can form on a variety of surfaces, including stairs, railings, sidewalks, roads, and even vehicles.\nWhat is black ice?\nBlack ice, also known as clear ice, refers to a delicate, nearly invisible layer of glaze ice that forms on various surfaces, especially on roadways. Despite its name, the ice is not black, but possesses exceptional transparency, enabling the underlying black pavement of the road, to remain visible.\nThe formation of black ice is frequently attributed to freezing fog, which can swiftly coat roadways with this treacherous hazard. Its near-invisibility renders black ice exceptionally perilous, as it poses a significant challenge for road users to detect.\nHow to stay safe?\nWhen freezing fog blankets your surroundings, the safest course of action may entail avoiding travel if at all possible. If venturing out becomes an inevitability, exercise utmost caution and heed these essential safety guidelines:\nHigh vigilance:\nBe vigilant, as freezing fog can give rise to the notorious black ice, which remains elusive and challenging to spot.\nReduce speed:\nDrive at a reduced pace, especially when icy conditions are suspected.\nVisibility priority:\nEnsure your vehicle is visible to others by using low-beam headlights, which also activate your taillights. If available, employ your fog lights.\nAvoid high-beams:\nRefrain from using high-beam headlights, as they create glare that impairs your visibility on the road.\nKeep a safe distance:\nMaintain a generous following distance to account for abrupt stops or shifting traffic patterns.\nStay in your lane:\nUse the road's lane markings as a guide to remaining in the correct lane.\nFor those taking to the skies, be aware that even a thin layer of ice can form on aircraft surfaces, posing significant flight safety risks. Ensure the aircraft is appropriately treated or equipped with effective de-icing systems before embarking on your journey.\nIn the realm of freezing fog, knowledge, and vigilance serve as your steadfast allies, empowering you to navigate these meteorological complexities with safety as your main priority.\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
