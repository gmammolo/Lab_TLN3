  "text": "Hurricane Melissa tore into Jamaica with sustained winds clocked at 185 mph. In the storm itself, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aircraft measured a gust at more than 250 mph. How fast is that? It is hard to imagine. A “185 ball” is one only an elite golfer can hit.\nI was nearby in 1954 when Hurricane Carol arrived in Old Saybrook with winds between 80 and 100 mph. I was huddled on a seawall dressed in a heavy coat because, like golf balls, rain drops sting at speed. When the wind picked up, it overturned a wooden rowboat and sent it skittering by my head. Later, I watched a dining room table exit a cottage through a picture window — picture that. Not being a golfer, flying boats and furniture are as close as I can get to imagining a force twice as strong.\nWhat happened in 1954 was a duff compared to what happened in the Caribbean on Oct. 28 when Hurricane Melissa landed and led to the deaths of 60 people. The wind, rain and storm surge damaged tens of thousands of homes as well as hospitals and roads and left populations without electricity or shelter.\nIn the history of tropical storms, in terms of peak winds at landfall, Melissa was the third strongest, after Dorian in 2019 and the Labor Day storm of 1935. It was second in terms of wind speed at sea, after Allen, which hit 190 mph in 1980. According to USA Today, “Melissa’s extreme winds, periods of rapidly intensifying winds, and the way it skipped a typical replacement of its inner core amazed scientists who study tropical cyclones.” The inner core is the usually calm eye.\nAmazing as she was, Melissa was not a complete outlier. As with other extreme weather events, she is part of a trend. The trend is perhaps more storms and definitely more violent ones. A 2012 study found that the proportion of major hurricanes (Category 3 to 5) had increased by about 25 percent over 39 years, and the storms that did form were more likely to be major storms. Witness Hurricanes Ivan (2004), Katrina (2005), Harvey (2017), Florence (2018), Ida (2021) and Francine (2024).\nWarmer ocean temperatures increase storms’ energy. The energy makes them intensify quicker, making it harder for people to take defensive action. Warmer air holds more moisture, thereby increasing precipitation. As sea levels rise due to the expansion of warmer water and increased precipitation, coastal flooding increases. So, yes, these storms cause great danger — without even mentioning that, regardless, more and more development is taking place along the coast and in low-lying inland areas.\nNature is not out to destroy us. She is trying to alert us to what’s happening so that we can save ourselves. The numbers, including the dramatic increase in severe storms and the billions in damage they cause, are compelling. Human suffering is even more compelling. So I ask golfers, elite or otherwise, and others with powerful strokes: How can we not address climate change?\nAt least, that’s how it looks from the White Oaks.",
