  "text": "India is preparing for a turbulent spell of weather as an intensifying low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal combines with a stubborn cold wave sweeping central states, creating a powerful mix of heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, squally winds, and sharply falling temperatures across multiple regions. The IMD’s latest forecasts show that the system is set to strengthen steadily, triggering relentless rain over coastal belts and island territories while dry northerly winds push temperatures far below normal in states like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. This rare overlap of contrasting weather systems is expected to disrupt travel, strain local infrastructure, and affect daily life from the southern coastline to the heart of central India, prompting authorities to issue widespread alerts as the country braces for days of volatile and shifting conditions.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued weather alerts across the country as a developing low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal is expected to bring significant changes to weather patterns in various regions. In addition to the low-pressure system, a persistent cold wave continues to affect central India, particularly parts of Madhya Pradesh. Over the coming days, the weather will bring heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and squally winds, particularly in coastal regions, the southern peninsular states, and island territories. Advertisement The low-pressure area is expected to form over the Southeast Bay of Bengal by November 22. This system is forecast to move west-northwestward, strengthening into a depression over the central south Bay of Bengal by November 24. Over the following 48 hours, the system is likely to intensify further as it tracks toward the southwest Bay of Bengal. Cold Wave Persists in Central India\nWhile southern peninsular states brace for heavy rainfall, cold wave conditions persist across central India, with West Madhya Pradesh being particularly affected. On November 20, severe cold wave conditions are expected to continue over the region, with temperatures dropping significantly below normal. The cold wave is likely to spread to parts of Maharashtra, eastern Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana by November 21, as dry northerly winds exacerbate the chill. Residents in these areas are advised to take extra precautions to shield themselves from the extreme cold. November 20: Active Weather in Andaman and Tamil Nadu\nOn November 20, active weather conditions will prevail, especially over the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Tamil Nadu. Heavy rainfall is expected in isolated areas, accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds reaching speeds of 40–50 kmph. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands will also experience lightning and rough seas, posing risks for small vessels. Coastal districts in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal are likely to witness thunderstorms, which could disrupt travel and outdoor activities. Additionally, cold wave conditions will persist in isolated parts of western Madhya Pradesh. November 21: Weather Intensity Increases\nBy November 21, the intensity of the weather will ramp up, particularly over the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected, with thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds reaching speeds of 40–60 kmph. Squally weather will continue over the Andaman Sea and adjoining parts of the southeast Bay of Bengal. Heavy rainfall is also forecast for isolated locations in Kerala, Mahe, and Tamil Nadu as the low-pressure system strengthens. Advertisement On November 22, the low-pressure system is expected to consolidate, influencing a broader area. Heavy rainfall will impact areas such as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Mahe, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. Thunderstorms, accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (40–60 kmph), are likely in these areas. The Andaman Sea and southeast Bay of Bengal will continue to experience squally conditions, with wind speeds of up to 65 kmph. November 23: Continued Heavy Rainfall\nOn November 23, the weather will remain active with continued heavy rainfall over the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Kerala, Mahe, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. Thunderstorms with lightning are expected in these areas, while the Andaman Sea will continue to experience squally weather with gusty winds. The IMD has issued marine warnings for the region, urging fishermen and small vessel operators to exercise caution. November 24: Depression Over the Bay of Bengal\nBy November 24, the low-pressure area is forecast to intensify into a depression over the central south Bay of Bengal. Heavy rainfall will persist over Kerala, Mahe, Tamil Nadu, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Thunderstorms and gusty winds (40–50 kmph) are likely, particularly over the islands. The IMD has not issued any fishermen warnings for the day, indicating a temporary easing of sea conditions despite the evolving system.\nIndia is bracing for severe weather as a low-pressure system intensifies, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, and cold wave conditions across multiple regions. The system’s impact will disrupt travel and daily life, with cold temperatures and squally winds affecting coastal and central India. November 25: Shift in Rainbelt\nAs the week progresses into November 25, the rain belt is expected to shift towards Andhra Pradesh, bringing heavy rainfall to coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema, and Tamil Nadu. Thunderstorms with lightning are likely to continue in these areas, while the Andaman & Nicobar Islands will experience persistent wet weather. Squally conditions will continue over the Andaman Sea.\nThe low-pressure system is expected to strengthen as it tracks west-northwestward. Further forecasts will clarify whether it will have a significant impact on India’s coastline beyond heavy rainfall. Residents, travelers, and fishermen in the affected regions are urged to stay updated with daily weather advisories as the system evolves. Advertisement",
