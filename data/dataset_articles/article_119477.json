  "text": "Drivers are being urged to make necessary preparations for upcoming severe weather conditions, as authorities advise allowing extra time to ready their vehicles. Essential supplies recommended for travel include warm clothing, food, water, a blanket, a torch, and a phone charger, all vital in case of extended delays on the road.\nPedestrians are encouraged to utilize pavements along main roads, which are more likely to have been treated for safety, minimizing the risk of slips and falls. For cyclists, sticking to these primary routes is also advised to ensure safer travel during adverse weather.\nIn addition, residents are urged to be ready for potential short power outages. It’s recommended that they keep torches, spare batteries, and a portable charger on hand to maintain communication and safety during such disruptions.\nThe Met Office has issued weather warnings, emphasizing the unpredictability of conditions and advising the public to stay informed through regular updates and forecasts. Preparedness is key as the weather situation may evolve rapidly, and officials stress the importance of taking necessary precautions.",
