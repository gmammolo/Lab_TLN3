  "text": "Ohio wakes beneath a thick blanket of fog as dim light glows through misty fields and quiet neighborhoods around Wilmington. Pavement shines with early moisture, and a cool west breeze drifts across rural roads as Thanksgiving travel begins rising across southwest Ohio. Conditions today may cause slower traffic on U.S. 68, I-71, and I-75.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, fog will continue through the morning before clouds settle in for the rest of the day. Calm winds and saturated ground allow fog pockets to reform quickly, especially in low-lying areas. Travelers should reduce speed, increase following distance, and expect sudden visibility drops during the busiest early travel window.\nRain expands tonight and becomes widespread Friday. Forecasters say a corridor of locally heavier rain may set up Friday afternoon and evening, which could create minor flooding in poor-drainage spots. This pattern could slow early holiday departures and cause backups on regional highways. To be fair, temperatures stay mild—holding in the mid-50s—which prevents any early winter precipitation.\nBut the broader picture is shifting. Meteorologists highlight an emerging Winter Tease across the country as a colder pattern evolves next week. Models hint at heavy snow potential somewhere across the northern U.S. between November 25 and December 3. While Wilmington sits south of the strongest risk, long-distance travelers may encounter snow, wind, or delays through the Midwest or Great Lakes near Thanksgiving.\nSaturday turns mostly sunny with a high in the low 50s—ideal for errands or outdoor prep before another round of rain arrives early next week. Sunday remains sunny and mild, offering one of the best pre-holiday travel days.\nFive-Day Outlook (Fri–Tue)\n• Friday: Rain, heavy at times, high mid-50s.\n• Saturday: Mostly sunny, high 51.\n• Sunday: Sunny, high 55.\n• Monday: Rain likely, high 54.\n• Tuesday: Chance of rain, high upper 40s.",
