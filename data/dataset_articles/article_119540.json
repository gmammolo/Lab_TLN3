  "text": "Michigan starts the day with a gray, calm sky, the kind that hints at seasonal change as crisp air settles across fields and damp pavement holds the chill. With Thanksgiving only a week away and travel already picking up, residents may want to keep a close eye on developing weather patterns that could influence weekend plans.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, West Michigan stays quiet today, but a subtle shift arrives Friday as slightly cooler air edges in from the northwest. The change remains gentle, yet travelers will notice breezier conditions during the afternoon and falling temperatures by sunset. Roads stay dry, but the late-fall air could feel brisk during evening commutes.\nSaturday brings the most notable transition. Temperatures hold near the mid-40s under mostly sunny skies, though cold air builds quickly once the sun dips. This early-season cooldown signals a broader pattern forming across the country. Meteorologists note that a large-scale dip in the jet stream may usher in colder-than-normal temperatures from the Northwest to the East Coast late next week. Models also hint at potential heavy snow — anywhere from 3 to 15 inches — in parts of the northern and central U.S. between Nov. 25 and Dec. 3 , raising the natural question for many: Could we see snow on Thanksgiving? For now, Grand Rapids remains on the milder side, but colder air is likely by mid-week.\nTravelers should plan for shifting temperatures, particularly for long drives toward the Great Lakes, Plains, or Northeast. The bigger winter push stays several days away, but early hints warrant attention.\nFive-Day Outlook for Grand Rapids, MI Today: Cloudy, high near 49.\nTonight: Chance of showers, low 39.\nFriday: Partly sunny, high 49.\nSaturday: Mostly sunny, high 45; colder evening.\nSunday: Mostly sunny, high 52.\nMonday: Partly sunny, high 52.",
