  "text": "Mississippi wakes to thick mist over wet pavement, and the gray air clings to headlights as early travelers begin their drives. Light fog shrouds fields along Highway 49, hinting at a warm, unsettled stretch that will matter for anyone planning early Thanksgiving trips.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Jackson will stay warm today with highs near 80°F, but rain chances grow as we move toward Friday. Residents should plan on changing conditions quickly. Roads may turn slick during passing showers, and visibility could drop fast in early mist pockets. Travelers heading out today or tomorrow should budget extra time.\nModels hint at a developing storm pattern that could push widespread rain into Mississippi by Friday afternoon. A few thunderstorms are possible, and wind gusts may pick up as the system organizes. This early “Winter Tease” comes one week before Thanksgiving, when travel demand surges across the South. While no cold snap follows immediately, a shift to cooler, more seasonable temperatures is expected early next week. To be fair, heavy snow is not expected here, but national patterns suggest some regions of the central and northern U.S. could see heavier snow between November 25 and early December.\nSaturday offers a brief break, with partly cloudy skies and highs near the upper 70s. Sunday turns sunnier and slightly cooler, making it ideal for yard cleanup or prepping vehicles for holiday trips. Early planners should still watch for next week’s rain signals, especially Tuesday and Wednesday, when additional showers may form.\nFive-Day Outlook for Jackson, MS Today: Partly sunny, high near 80.\nFriday: Rain and storms possible, high near 80.\nSaturday: Partly cloudy, high near 79.\nSunday: Mostly sunny, high near 78.\nMonday: Slight chance of showers, high near 78.",
