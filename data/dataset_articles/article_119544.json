  "text": "Indianapolis, IN – Indiana may face a sharp drop in temperatures heading into Thanksgiving week, raising concerns about frostbite and hypothermia, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook highlights a significant pattern shift beginning November 25, with colder-than-normal air likely across the Midwest through early December.\nAccording to NOAA , the upcoming cold is being influenced by several atmospheric factors, including the ongoing La Niña pattern, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the possibility of a rare late-November sudden stratospheric warming event. These forces may channel Arctic air deep into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., positioning Indiana within the zone of below-normal temperatures.\nAs families prepare for Thanksgiving travel, holiday markets, football games, and other outdoor gatherings, health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can develop far more quickly than many residents realize — especially when wind chills drop below freezing.\nCommon frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may appear after rewarming\nTen key signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling or clumsiness, drowsiness, and — in severe cases — loss of consciousness. Infants may present with bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA advises Indiana residents to dress in warm layers, keep extremities covered, and limit time outdoors during the coldest periods of the holiday week. Anyone showing signs of frostbite or hypothermia should seek immediate medical attention and warm affected areas using warm — not hot — water or gentle body heat.",
