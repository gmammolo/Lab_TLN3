  "text": "Pennsylvania wakes under a dim, muted sky as dense freezing fog clings to fields, rooftops, and quiet roadways. The air feels sharp and still, and headlights cut through a pale haze that hangs only feet above the pavement. With Thanksgiving travel beginning to build, the morning slowdown is already taking shape.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 9 a.m. across central Pennsylvania, including the State College region. Visibility may drop below a quarter mile in spots, and a thin glaze of ice is possible on bridges and overpasses. Drivers should reduce speed, leave extra braking space, and expect slower traffic until the fog lifts.\nBy midday, conditions improve as temperatures rise into the mid-40s with cloudy skies. Moisture thickens again late tonight, allowing patchy fog to reform. Friday brings a shift toward milder weather. A band of light rain may move through after lunchtime, and highs should reach the low 50s—good news for early holiday errands and local travel.\nSaturday turns cooler behind the rain, though sunshine returns and winds stay light. The weekend finishes quiet, but broader national patterns are beginning to change. Meteorologists note early signs of a winter-like push from the Northwest spreading eastward next week. Models even hint at the potential for heavy snow—anywhere from 3 to 15 inches—between Nov. 25 and Dec. 3 across parts of the northern and central U.S. Pennsylvanians may not see major impacts yet, but colder air likely arrives just before Thanksgiving, raising the seasonal question: Could flakes fly on the holiday? For now, confidence remains low, but trends deserve watching.\nFive-Day Outlook for State College, PA Today: Dense freezing fog early; cloudy, high 44.\nTonight: Patchy fog, low 35.\nFriday: Rain chance after 1 p.m.; high 52.\nSaturday: Mostly sunny, high 47.\nSunday: Mostly sunny, high near 50.\nMonday: Mostly cloudy, high 50.",
