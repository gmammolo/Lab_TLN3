  "text": "Boston, MA – As Thanksgiving approaches, Massachusetts may face a punch of winter cold that could increase the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, according to new guidance from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The agency’s Nov. 19 outlook shows a major pattern shift beginning November 25, with below-normal temperatures likely across the Northeast through early December.\nAccording to NOAA , the developing cold pattern is influenced by several atmospheric drivers, including La Niña, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and what some meteorologists suggest may be a rare November sudden stratospheric warming event. These factors could send unusually cold Arctic air into the North-Central and Eastern U.S., placing Massachusetts directly in the cold zone.\nWith holiday travel surging, outdoor shopping events underway, and families gathering throughout the week, health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can develop faster than many expect—even after short periods outside.\nCommon frostbite signs include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, or waxy-looking skin\n• Skin color changes (red, white, blue, gray, purple)\n• Blisters after rewarming\nTen key hypothermia symptoms:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling, drowsiness, and—if critical—loss of consciousness. Infants may show bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA advises Massachusetts residents to bundle in layers, protect exposed skin, and limit time outdoors during the coldest periods. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical attention and warm the affected areas using warm—not hot—water or gentle body heat.",
