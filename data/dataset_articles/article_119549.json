  "text": "Ohio wakes under a heavy blanket of low clouds this morning as Lake Erie’s gray horizon blends straight into the skyline. The air feels crisp, and pavement carries a cold sheen as early travelers move slowly along I-90 and Route 2. It’s the kind of November start that signals a shifting pattern right as Thanksgiving travel begins building across the region.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Cleveland stays mostly cloudy today with a light south wind and only a slight rain chance late tonight. Visibility remains stable for now, but cooler air spreads across northern Ohio through the next 48 hours. Travelers heading toward downtown, Hopkins, or lakefront neighborhoods should expect periods of low contrast and damp roads, especially during the late-day commute.\nFriday brings a small chance of light rain as clouds thicken again. While amounts appear minimal, even brief showers could slow traffic along the Shoreway and I-71. To be fair, this stretch remains mostly quiet, but the bigger story may arrive next week. National models hint at a potential “Winter Tease” as colder air spills into the Great Lakes and Northeast heading into Thanksgiving. Some regions to the north may see heavy snow between November 25 and early December. Cleveland sits close to that transition zone, and any shift in the wind pattern could introduce a small lake-effect snow chance late next week.\nFor now, the weekend looks cooperative. Saturday turns partly sunny and seasonably cool—ideal for early holiday errands, pre-Thanksgiving grocery trips, or outdoor preparations before temperatures fall again. Sunday stays bright and mild before a stronger rain chance develops on Monday.\nFive-Day Outlook (Thursday Through Monday) • Today: Mostly cloudy, high near 51.\n• Friday: Slight rain chance, high near 53.\n• Saturday: Partly sunny, high near 46.\n• Sunday: Mostly sunny, high near 52.\n• Monday: Partly sunny, rain chance late, high near 52.",
