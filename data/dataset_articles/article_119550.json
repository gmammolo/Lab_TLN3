  "text": "Cheyenne, WY – Wyoming may face a surge of early-season Arctic cold heading into Thanksgiving week, raising concerns about frostbite and hypothermia, according to updated projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Nov. 19 climate outlook highlights a major pattern shift beginning November 25, with colder-than-normal temperatures likely across the Northern and Central Rockies into early December.\nAccording to NOAA , the expected cold is being driven by ongoing La Niña conditions, the Madden–Julian Oscillation, and the possibility of a rare late-November sudden stratospheric warming event. These atmospheric factors may help funnel Arctic air southward into the North-Central and Western U.S., placing Wyoming directly inside the below-normal temperature band.\nWith hunters in the field, travelers crossing long stretches of open highway, and ranching activity still underway, state health officials warn that frostbite and hypothermia can develop rapidly — especially when wind chills tumble far below freezing.\nCommon frostbite symptoms include:\n• Numbness or loss of feeling\n• Tingling or prickling sensations\n• Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin\n• Skin discoloration (red, white, blue, gray, or purple)\n• Blisters that may appear after rewarming\nTen key signs of hypothermia:\nShivering, slurred speech, shallow breathing, weak pulse, confusion, memory loss, severe fatigue, stumbling, drowsiness, and — in severe cases — loss of consciousness. Infants may present with bright red, cold skin and unusually low energy.\nNOAA urges Wyoming residents to dress in layered, insulated clothing, guard exposed skin, and limit outdoor exposure during the coldest periods of Thanksgiving week. Anyone showing frostbite or hypothermia symptoms should seek immediate medical care and warm affected areas with warm — not hot — water or gentle body heat.",
