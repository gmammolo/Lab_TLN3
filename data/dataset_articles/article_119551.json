  "text": "Pennsylvania — Thick gray air hugs the hills around Pittsburgh this morning as dense fog softens headlights, streetlamps, and river bridges. Pavement gleams under the low ceiling, and quiet pockets of fog drift over ridges and valleys, creating a deceptively calm yet hazardous travel environment as Thanksgiving traffic begins to rise.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 9 a.m. for much of western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia, and eastern Ohio. Visibility may drop to one quarter mile or less , especially along I-79, I-376, and the Ohio River corridor . Drivers should slow down, use low beams, and leave extra distance, as sudden visibility drops may occur around bends and over bridges.\nThe fog gradually lifts into a mostly cloudy afternoon, but Friday brings the next travel-impacting shift. A chance of rain develops after 7 a.m. Friday, followed by a stronger surge of moisture Friday night. Rain becomes likely after sunset, with steadier bands potentially reducing visibility and slowing regional travel. To be fair, temperatures remain well above freezing, preventing any icy concerns locally.\nSaturday features a slight chance of lingering rain early before skies brighten into the afternoon. Travelers heading east into the Appalachians or north toward the Great Lakes should watch for shifting weather zones, as long-range models now highlight an emerging “Winter Tease” across the central and eastern U.S. next week. Some areas from the Midwest to interior New England could see heavy snow potential between Nov. 25 and Dec. 3 , which may affect connecting flights and long-distance routes.\nSunday turns sunny and calm—one of the best windows for pre-Thanksgiving travel across the region.\nFive-Day Outlook Friday: Fog early; rain chances grow; highs near 55.\nSaturday: Slight rain chance early; highs near 49.\nSunday: Sunny; highs near 53.\nMonday: Mostly cloudy; highs near 54.\nTuesday: Rain likely; highs near 49.",
