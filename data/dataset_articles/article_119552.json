  "text": "Illinois wakes under muted skies as fog drifts low across Lake Michigan and curls through city streets. Traffic lights glow faintly in the damp air, and wet pavement reflects the early haze. Travelers heading out for early Thanksgiving plans will feel the moisture immediately—visibility drops quickly in pockets across the Chicago metro.\nFog and patchy drizzle slow the morning drive, especially near the lakefront and major corridors like I-55, I-57, and I-94. Drivers should take extra time and expect reduced visibility through mid-morning. Light southwest winds keep conditions steady but not improving quickly, so watch for slick spots on bridges and ramps.\nThe gradual shift comes later today as clouds thicken. While temperatures rise into the upper 40s, the air stays damp and gray. Drizzle may return by mid-afternoon, signaling the pattern change that leads into Friday’s more impactful weather.\nFriday brings the next key travel concern: a 20%–30% chance of rain , beginning midday and lingering into the evening. Models show a modest but steady band of moisture approaching from the southwest. While accumulations remain light, any rain during the rush can tighten traffic across the region—especially for early Thanksgiving departures. Travelers should plan for slower speeds and consider leaving earlier in the day.\nSaturday finally breaks the damp stretch with sunshine and a mild high near 49. Sunday stays sunny and even warmer, offering one of the best late-November outdoor windows for errands, early holiday decorating, or travel resets before the next workweek.\nNationally, meteorologists continue watching a colder pattern building between November 25 and December 3 , with potential heavy snow across parts of the Northwest, Central U.S., and possibly the Northeast. Travelers should monitor updates as Thanksgiving approaches.\nFive-Day Outlook Friday: Rain chance. High 50.\nSaturday: Mostly sunny. High 49.\nSunday: Sunny. High 56.\nMonday: Partly sunny. High 53.\nTuesday: Rain chance. High 52.",
