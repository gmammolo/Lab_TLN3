  "text": "Louisiana wakes to a muted, gray horizon this morning as dense fog curls low across roads, bridges, and marshland. Headlights cut through the thick, milky air, and wet pavement reflects every beam—a clear sign for drivers to slow down as early travel ramps up ahead of the Thanksgiving rush.\nExpect visibility to shift quickly through mid-morning. Anyone commuting along I-10, the Causeway, or the Westbank Expressway should build extra time into morning plans. The fog may ease by late morning, but damp air lingers, and light winds keep the calm, sticky feel in place. For now, the main travel impacts remain tied to slow-downs and lane-to-lane visibility drops. After all, it only takes a few minutes of caution to stay ahead of sudden changes.\nRain returns later today as moisture lifts into the region, and a steady warm push sends highs toward the upper 70s. A few showers may drift in by late afternoon, but the more organized rain arrives Friday. Models hint at a narrow zone of heavier downpours, and a rogue thunderstorm can’t be ruled out. While severe weather appears unlikely, travelers heading toward Baton Rouge, Gulfport, or Mobile should watch for brief ponding in low spots.\nSaturday brings the payoff—sun, lighter winds, and mild November warmth. It’s ideal for outdoor prep, holiday decorating, or early travel before next week’s national pattern shift. Long-range signals still suggest a winter tease for parts of the central and northern U.S. near Thanksgiving, with a chance of heavy snow in colder states. It’s too early to pin down impacts for the Gulf South, but cooler air may press eastward after the holiday.\nFive-Day Outlook (New Orleans, LA) Today: Fog early, then partly sunny. High near 78.\nFriday: Showers, isolated thunder. High near 80.\nSaturday: Mostly sunny and warm. High near 80.\nSunday: Partly cloudy. High near 79.\nMonday: Chance of storms. High near 78.",
