  "text": "Arkansas wakes under a dim, misty sky as patchy fog hangs over quiet neighborhoods and reflects softly in streetlights. Damp roads glisten, and the air feels warm for late November, carrying the steady scent of rain that signals a change already unfolding. Travelers starting early Thanksgiving trips should build in extra time, especially with showers thickening during the morning commute.\nRain and thunderstorms expand across central Arkansas through the late morning and midday. Some cells may deliver heavier downpours that briefly reduce visibility and slow traffic on I-30, I-40, and local connectors through Little Rock. Residents should watch for quick changes in pavement conditions as warm air meets pockets of cooler flow from the northwest—an early Winter Tease hinting at the broader seasonal shift happening across the country.\nFriday stays unsettled, with another round of showers developing near midday. A few storms could produce gusty winds, but the main impact remains steady rainfall. Anyone traveling for early holiday errands should plan around the wetter midday window, as clouds linger before conditions dry toward evening.\nSaturday brings a welcome reset, with sun breaking through and temperatures climbing into the low 70s—ideal for outdoor decorating, late-season leaf cleanup, or prepping vehicles before heavier travel begins next week. Sunday stays mostly quiet, although clouds return late with a slight chance of showers.\nLooking nationwide, long-range signals show potential for heavy snow in portions of the U.S. from November 25 through early December , especially across the Northwest, Rockies, Midwest, and Northeast. Those flying or driving long distances for Thanksgiving should stay alert to updates as winter patterns strengthen.\nFive-Day Outlook Saturday: Mostly sunny, high near 71.\nSunday: Partly sunny, high near 68.\nMonday: Showers possible, high near 84.\nTuesday: Showers likely, high near 75.\nWednesday: Mostly clear, high near 59.",
