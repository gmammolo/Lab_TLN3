  "text": "Tennessee starts the morning wrapped in thick, silver fog as headlights glow over wet pavement and tree lines fade into the haze around Memphis. Visibility drops sharply near open fields and low-lying stretches of road, creating an early travel slowdown just one week before Thanksgiving. Drivers heading out before sunrise may need extra time, especially around school zones and the I-40/I-55 corridors.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, a Dense Fog Advisory remains in effect until 10 a.m. , with visibility falling under one mile across parts of West Tennessee, North Mississippi, Southeast Missouri, and East Arkansas. Conditions should gradually improve late this morning, but patches of lingering mist may still impact early travel plans.\nRain and thunderstorm chances return later today as moisture lifts north. A few stronger cells could form in the afternoon, mainly south of Memphis, bringing brief downpours and gusty winds. Travelers heading toward airport pickups or early holiday getaways should plan for slower traffic and occasional ponding on roads. Models hint at a Winter Tease next week for parts of the Midwest and Northeast, raising the question many holiday travelers are asking: what are the chances of snow on Thanksgiving? For now, Memphis stays warm, but cooler air will spread east across the country by mid-week.\nFriday brings a higher chance of thunderstorms, especially after midday. Some storms may produce heavier rainfall that could briefly reduce visibility again. Roads may turn slick heading into the evening commute.\nSaturday improves with drier, calmer conditions and highs near 70°, ideal for outdoor prep, early decorating, or travel departures.\nFive-Day Outlook (Memphis) Saturday: Mostly sunny, near 70°.\nSunday: Mostly sunny, high 68°.\nMonday: Rain possible, high 72°.\nTuesday: Showers likely, high 73°.\nWednesday: Partly sunny, high 58°.",
