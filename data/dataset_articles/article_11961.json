If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member.\nAccording to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market.

The Company then resorted to brand collaborations to \"carry quarters\" despite weak financial results. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period.
