  "text": "WEATHER Arctic surge may spread to Oklahoma. Here's when to expect frigid air Brandi D. Addison USA TODAY NETWORK\nAI-assisted summary A storm system is expected to bring rain and a blast of cold air to Oklahoma around Thanksgiving week. A rare stratospheric warming event could weaken the polar vortex, potentially sending colder Arctic air further south into the U.S. Climate patterns like La Niña and the Madden-Julian Oscillation are contributing to a forecast of colder, more winter-like conditions for the central and northern U.S. While snow is not expected in Oklahoma, the northern Plains may see some light snow with potential for blowing due to cold, dry air. A storm system will move through Oklahoma Tuesday into Tuesday night, Nov. 26, bringing rain across the region. The real story comes behind it: a blast of cold air sweeping in , dropping temperatures sharply and giving the first taste of true winter chill.\nOn the back side of the storm, there’s a small chance of snow late Tuesday into early Wednesday, Nov. 26, in the northern Plains. Snow is not expected in Oklahoma, and accumulations are likely to remain light. Still, the cold, dry air could make any flakes prone to blowing, creating visibility hazards in areas that do see snow.\nA rare stratospheric warming event is being monitored high above the Arctic, but it is not expected to directly affect Oklahoma for several days. It could influence storm tracks later in the week, though details remain uncertain.\n\"Following a warm start to November in the West and a cold start in the East, the combined effects from (several weather conditions) may usher in a significant pattern change later in the month and into early December,\" the Climate Prediction Center wrote . \"During Thanksgiving week, a colder pattern is likely for the West and the Northern Plains wild milder air overspreads the East. A transition to a colder pattern is then forecast across much of the central and northern U.S. into early December.\n\"This pattern change favors a transition to more winter-like conditions across the west-central and central U.S. including much below normal temperatures and the potential for heavy snow,\" the CPC added.\nTwo climate signals are particularly important: the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), a tropical thunderstorm pattern that can shift cold and warm air across the U.S., and La Niña, which tends to push Arctic air farther south.\nCombined, these patterns are likely to mean an \"increased cold air intrusion across the northern tier of the contiguous United States\" over the next couple weeks, the forecast states — and some of that air may reach Oklahoma, though it may take time and may not be as intense as previous blasts.\nAnother Arctic blast is on the move toward the U.S ., bringing the potential for bitter cold and heavy snow accumulations to Indiana — possibly beginning during the holiday weekend into early December.\nIt’s unclear whether this event will be as intense as the Nov. 10 system that brought up to a foot of snow near Buffalo and did support Indiana's first snow of the season. However, the cold is unlikely to reach as far south as it did when record-breaking temperatures hit parts of Florida.\n\"Following a warm start to November in the West and a cold start in the East, the combined effects from (several weather conditions) may usher in a significant pattern change later in the month and into early December,\" the Climate Prediction Center wrote . \"During Thanksgiving week, a colder pattern is likely for the West and the Northern Plains wild milder air overspreads the East. A transition to a colder pattern is then forecast across much of the central and northern U.S. into early December.\n\"This pattern change favors a transition to more winter-like conditions across the west-central and central U.S. including much below normal temperatures and the potential for heavy snow,\" the CPC added.\nAccording to the Climate Prediction Center, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) — a moving pattern of thunderstorms in the tropics — can influence how cold or warm air shifts across the U.S., while La Niña — a cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean — tends to push Arctic air farther south, increasing the chance of cold outbreaks across the northern states.\nCombined, these patterns are likely to mean an \"increased cold air intrusion across the northern tier of the contiguous United States\" over the next couple weeks, the forecast states .\n'An extraordinary and unique event' could be brewing Experts say an unusual stratospheric pattern could reshape winter weather across the Northern Hemisphere if it develops next week.\nThe phenomenon, known as a sudden stratospheric warming, it's \"the largest type of disruption that occurs to the polar vortex,\" climatologist Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT , in an email to USA TODAY.\nEssentially, the polar vortex acts as a tight rubber band circling the North Pole in the stratosphere, 10 to 30 miles above the surface, keeping frigid Arctic air locked in place. When sudden stratospheric warming weakens it, that band stretches unevenly and becomes wavy, allowing lobes of cold air to slip much farther south. But this doesn’t happen automatically — the jet stream acts as the gatekeeper, or the force reshaping the band, deciding where, or even if, that cold air moves.\nSo, contrary to what its description may suggest, a weakened polar vortex means circulation around the North Pole isn't as tight, more likely to spill and bring harsher winter weather to the U.S., while a strong vortex keeps Arctic air contained, leading to milder winter conditions here.\nThe atmosphere is at a \"critical juncture,\" and what happens in November could be a \"fork in the road\" for the rest of the winter, Cohen said.\nIf this occurs, it would be the first such event in November since accurate satellite records began, he added. There were two known events in the pre-satellite era, November 1958 and 1968.\n\"I tend not to rely on stratospheric data before satellite data was available,\" Cohen said. So if a stratospheric warming event occurs, \"that would be an extraordinary, even unique event.\"\nOklahoma weather forecast for Thanksgiving As of Wednesday, Nov. 19, Oklahoma’s Thanksgiving week begins mild, but a noticeable cold front will arrive Friday, Nov. 21. Highs will drop from near 69°F on Thursday to around 48–61°F on Saturday. By next week, temperatures will fall further, with lows in the mid-30s and highs near 50°F through Nov. 27.\nA storm system will move through the region Tuesday into Tuesday night, Nov. 26, bringing rain and bitter cold temps. The real impact comes behind the system: a blast of cold air sweeping in, signaling the first real taste of winter chill.\nOn the back side of the storm, northern Plains areas may see a small chance of snow late Tuesday into early Wednesday, Nov. 26. Snow is not expected in Oklahoma, and any accumulations are likely to remain light, even if the Arctic blast develops as forecast. Still, the cold, dry air could make any flakes prone to blowing, creating visibility hazards in areas that do see snow.\nAcross the U.S., AccuWeather meteorologists warn that this storm system could cause travel disruptions in the western and central states, with heavy snow and cold rain. Gusty winds behind the system may impact travel and outdoor events elsewhere, but Oklahoma’s main concern will be the significant drop in temperatures and gusty winds accompanying the cold front.\nWhat does the polar vortex look like right now? Right now, charts show the polar vortex is unusually weak — similar to its strength in early autumn — and is likely to send temps plunging across the U.S. beginning early next week.\nThis weakness is linked to very low winds high above the Arctic, called zonal winds, which are now declining and approaching 0 m/s, a threshold that can trigger an event called major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). These events often lead to significant cold outbreaks and even blizzards.\n( Note about graphs: The dashed 0 m/s line marks the boundary between westerly winds (above the line), which represent a normal, intact stratospheric polar vortex, and easterly winds (below the line), which indicate a reversal of the vortex and meet the definition of a major sudden stratospheric warming if sustained. In the initial graph, on Nov. 1, the forecast members (blue lines) are at the top of the chart, signaling a strong polar vortex. In the latter graph, many forecast members (blue lines) dip toward or below 0 m/s in late November, showing the potential for a significant weakening or even reversal of the 10 hPa zonal winds, compared with the typical climatological values shown in red. )\nThe vortex’s instability is also influenced by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), a stratospheric wind pattern that shifts between easterly and westerly roughly every 28–29 months. When the QBO is in its easterly phase, as it is now, the vortex is more prone to wobble south.\nMeanwhile, a weak La Niña in the lower atmosphere is shaping winter patterns as well. While it doesn’t directly affect the polar vortex, it can shift the jet stream, influencing where Arctic air travels and how long cold outbreaks linger. La Niña may also leave large bodies of unfrozen, increasing the risk of lake-effect snow in the Great Lakes when Arctic air moves over open water.\nStay informed.
