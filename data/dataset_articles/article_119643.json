  "text": "A status yellow warning of low temperatures and ice has been issued for 10 counties in the Republic.\nMet Éireann’s warning applies to counties Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wicklow and Tipperary. It will be in effect from midnight on Thursday to 8am on Friday.\nThe impacted counties are forecast to experience widespread frost and some icy stretches, with minimum air temperatures of -3 degrees Celsius, possibly lower locally. The forecaster also warned of hazardous driving conditions and possible animal welfare issues.\nIn Northern Ireland, a UK Met Office snow and ice warning is in place for counties Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry.\nIce, frost, hail, sleet, snow and hazardous driving conditions are expected in many areas on Thursday following overnight frost.\nMet Éireann’s Rebecca Cantwell warned on Wednesday of “icy stretches and possibly hazardous travelling conditions”.\nShe said Thursday would be “another cold day with frost and icy patches slow to clear”.\n“Many places will be dry with sunshine, but showers will continue in northern and western areas, with further wintry falls possible. The showers will die out though through the day. Highs of just three to seven degrees.”\nIn Northern Ireland, wintry showers will gradually ease on Thursday.\nScattered showers, mainly falling as rain or sleet, will become increasingly isolated through the day with increasing sunny spells. It will be largely dry by evening, with winds easing. Maximum temperature of 5 degrees are forecast.\nExplainer\nWhat do Met Éireann’s weather warnings mean?\nStatus yellow\nStatus orange\nStatus red\nThe outlook for the coming days in the Republic is for temperatures to drop to as low as -4, before rain brings warmer temperatures at the weekend.\nRain and drizzle on Friday morning is expected to become more persistent towards the afternoon, as a band of rain moves in from the west. Lowest temperatures of 2 to 7 degrees are likely on Friday night.\nTemperatures are expected to climb further to highs of 7 to 12 degrees on Saturday, which is set to see persistent rain spreading from the southwest from midday and into Saturday night.\nSunday looks likely to remain “generally unsettled” with widespread cloud and showery outbreaks of rain.\nClearer spells will develop throughout the afternoon, however, with showers becoming more scattered. Highest temperatures of 6 to 10 degrees are expected, alongside winds reaching strong to near gale force strength along Atlantic coasts.",
