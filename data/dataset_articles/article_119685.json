  "text": "The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration said “generally fair” weather will prevail in this year’s final weekend, hence Filipinos can expect to welcome the New Year with clear skies. In a television interview on Friday, PAGASA weather specialist Rhea Torres said they did not monitor any weather disturbance throughout the weekend. “Since we are currently not monitoring any low-pressure area or any tropical cyclones within and outside of the Philippine Area of Responsibility, we’re expecting this coming New Year to be generally fair – or to experience generally fair weather conditions over large portions of the country,” Torres said. Despite the forecast of fair weather until New Year’s Day, Torres said partly cloudy skies with isolated rains or thunderstorms may be experienced over Batanes, Babuyan Islands, Mimaropa, Bicol Region and other areas in the Visayas and Mindanao. Torres added cold air and a slight possibility of rain may still be experienced in some parts of the country due to the northeast monsoon or “Amihan” and the easterlies — the winds blowing from the east. In its weekly weather outlook, PAGASA said southern Luzon and eastern Visayas will experience cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms due to easterlies while “Amihan” will affect northern and central Luzon from 29 to 31 December Meanwhile, PAGASA said that the eastern section of northern and central Luzon will experience mostly cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms due to the shear line from 1 to 2 January 2024. Mostly cloudy skies with isolated light rains will prevail over the rest of northern and central Luzon, Calabarzon, and Metro Manila in the first two days of the New Year. PAGASA advised sea travelers to exercise extra caution due to the surge of the northeast monsoon, which may result in rough to very rough sea conditions, particularly in the seaboards of northern Luzon, the eastern seaboard of central and southern Luzon, and eastern Visayas. From 3 to 5 January, the eastern section of northern and central Luzon will experience mostly cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms due to the shear line while the Amihan will bring cloudy skies with isolated rains over the northern and central Luzon, Calabarzon and Metro Manila. Further, the eastern section of southern Luzon, eastern Visayas and Caraga region will experience mostly cloudy with scattered rains and thunderstorms due to easterlies. At the same time, the rest of the country will have partly cloudy skies with isolated rains or thunderstorms.
