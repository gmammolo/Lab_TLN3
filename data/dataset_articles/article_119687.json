  "text": "Christmas is over, which means we’re headed into the coldest – and what feels like the longest – month of the year.\nWhile January may have you down in the dumps, these homemade cozy winter cocktails (and mocktails) can brighten your spirits.\nAt the very least, they’ll warm you up!\nRed Wine Hot Chocolate ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder 2 tablespoons white sugar 1 pinch salt 2 cups reduced-fat milk, divided ½ cup fruity, dry red wine, such as merlot or shiraz Over medium heat, whisk together the cocoa powder, sugar and salt in a small saucepan. Slowly add ¼ cup milk and whisk until smooth.\nWhisk in the remaining milk, stirring often until hot, or about 3 minutes, Eating Well says . Do not bring to a simmer.\nRemove from heat and stir in wine.\nFor a nonalcoholic version, leave out the wine or use 0% alcohol red wine, which can be found at package stores such as Total Wine & More .\nSlow-Cooker Hot Cider with Bourbon 8 whole cloves 8 whole allspice berries 8 cinnamon sticks 1 gallon apple cider 2 cups bourbon of choice 1 apple, thinly sliced, for garnish Combine cider and spices in a slow cooker and let simmer for 20 minutes, or until warm. Add bourbon and serve hot, Eating Well says . Garnish with an apple slice and cinnamon stick.\nTo make this nonalcoholic, leave out the bourbon . For those who don't like bourbon but still want the drink to buzz, apple brandy can also be used.\nHot Butterbeer Cocktail 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cubed ½ cup dark brown sugar ¼ cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Pinch of salt ⅓ cup maple whiskey or bourbon 2 cups plain seltzer Melt the butter in a small saucepan and add brown sugar. Bring to a simmer, whisking continuously until the consistency becomes smooth. Add in cream and continue to cook, whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens, about 4 to 5 minutes.\nRemove from heat and add in vanilla and salt, whisking until combined.\nIn a separate saucepan, combine whiskey or bourbon and seltzer until simmering. Remove from heat and add to the butter mixture. The drink will \"magically bubble and foam,\" Eating Well says .\nIf you prefer the drink nonalcoholic, forgo the spirits and simply warm the seltzer before adding to the butter mixture.\nSlow-Cooker Mulled Wine 1 bottle dry red wine, such as merlot or cabernet sauvignon 2 cups apple cider ¼ cup apple brandy ¼ cup pure maple syrup 1 tablespoon cider vinegar Zest and juice of 1 orange, plus slices for garnish 6 whole allspice berries 6 whole cloves 2 whole star anise 2 green cardamom pods 2 cinnamon sticks, plus more for garnish Combine wine, cider, brandy, maple syrup, vinegar, orange zest and juice, allspice, cloves, star anise, cardamom and cinnamon sticks in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until hot, or approximately 1 hour.\nOnce cooked, strain out the solids and serve warm. This Eating Well recipe also suggests garnishing with orange slices and cinnamon sticks, if desired.\nSugar Cookie Martini For the rim:\n½ cup powdered sugar 2 teaspoons half-and-half ¼ cup sprinkles For the martini:\n3 oz. vanilla vodka 3 oz. Irish cream liqueur, such as Bailey's 2 oz. butterscotch schnapps 2 oz. half-and-half Ice For the rim:\nIn a small bowl slightly wider than the glass you're using, combine the powdered sugar and half-and-half. It should be very thick. On a small plate, place sprinkles.\nDip the rims into the icing mixture and twist to coat. Then dip the frosted rims into the sprinkles and refrigerate until ready to use.\nFor the martini:\nIn a cocktail shaker, combine the vanilla vodka, Irish cream liqueur, butterscotch schnapps, half-and-half and ice. Cover and shake vigorously. Strain into the chilled glasses .\nPoinsettia Champagne Cocktail ½ oz. orange liqueur 3 oz. cranberry juice 3 oz. champagne or sparkling wine Fresh cranberries, for garnish Fresh rosemary sprig, for garnish Pour the orange liqueur and cranberry juice into a chilled champagne flute and stir well. Add the champagne or sparkling wine and garnishes and enjoy .\nSimilar to the red wine hot chocolate, for a nonalcoholic version, use 0% alcohol sparkling wine.",
