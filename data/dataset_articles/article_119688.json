  "text": "Maryland Weather: Spot shower Friday then wonderful weekend!\nMaryland Weather: Spot shower Friday then wonderful weekend!\nAfter a tough stretch of weather, Baltimore is in for a nice and quiet stretch of weather. Friday may see a spot shower, but the weekend is expected to be dry and cool, with a mix of sunshine and clouds. The evening will be nice, dry, and comfortable, with seasonably chilly weather overnight.\nWeekend Forecast\nBoth Saturday and Sunday are expected to have highs in the upper 40s to near 50, with gusty winds on Saturday making temperatures feel like the 30s. Despite the chilly weather, the weekend is set to end 2023 in style with pleasant conditions for outdoor activities.\nQUIET NIGHT AHEAD: These low temperatures are typically where our average highs should be, so I hesitate to use the word cold. It’s a chill in the air, but nothing we can’t handle. The night looks dry with partial clearing. Easy start to our Friday! @WJZ pic.twitter.com/PYHvUtf5k9\n— Steven Sosna (@SteveSosnaWX) December 28, 2023",
