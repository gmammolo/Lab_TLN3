  "text": "It’s a Tuesday morning. The weather is unusually cold, far too cold for kids who have grown up in the desert. As my friends and I walk to class together, huddled closely to share warmth, we begin to talk about what the day will bring until we stop dead in our tracks. As we talk, a fog comes out of our mouths. We breathe out and smile when we come to the realization that it is a special morning.\nIt is so cold that we can see our own breath.\nTo others living somewhere where the cold and even snow is a normality, they might just acknowledge it and move on. They might not even notice it.\nBut to us, desert teenagers so accustomed to over triple-digit degrees, this is a once-in-a-lifetime event. So we stand there, laughing and breathing and swatting away our breath just to start all over again. The bell rings, signaling that we are late to class, but we stay there nonetheless, watching our breath with a special type of wonder as it disappears into the freezing air, and I cannot help but think of how beautiful desert winters can be.\nWinter in the desert is sudden. Slowly the mornings get fresher, cooler, until one day it is an absolutely freezing 65 degrees. At school, students wear fur-lined jackets and beanies, long sleeves and thick socks. Administration finally agrees to turn on the heater, and a special kind of warmth and the smell of burning dust flood out of the classrooms' open doors. Through chattering teeth students complain about how much they hate the cold – that the weather is so much better when it’s hot, and how the days are so much more beautiful when the sun is actually providing warmth. However, when chattering teeth have stilled and voices go quiet, the same students who were complaining moments ago are left with resting smiles as they relish the fact that the cold weather has finally arrived.\nThe Coachella Valley isn’t exactly known for being a winter wonderland. The closest thing we have to blizzards are sandstorms, and it is an unfortunate truth that a snowman wouldn’t stand a chance of survival in our weather. Nonetheless, winter in the desert has always held an especially warm place in my heart. Living in a place iconically known for its year-round heat, this season is something I have always looked forward to.\nWinter is the special time when the cicadas finally stop chirping their desert songs and are replaced by the constant hum of Christmas music. Winter marks the beginning of the tourist season as snowbirds pour in and suddenly the barren streets of downtown Palm Springs are brought back to life. Candy Cane Lane lights up once again, and as my sisters and I drive around the decorated cul-de-sac with hot chocolate in our hands and windows down as we blast Wham’s “Last Christmas” – a yearly tradition – I know that the desert winter has finally arrived once again.\nPerhaps I am biased from growing up here. I have never seen snowflakes fall from the sky and I have never made a snow angel. I can’t even fathom ice skating on a real frozen lake, let alone sledding down a mountain. However, I can stand by the fact that to me and to many, there is truly nothing like a Coachella Valley winter.\nIvana Rodriguez is a senior at Palm Desert High School.
