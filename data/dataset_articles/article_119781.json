  "text": "Cold weather chic: Cate Blanchett in Carol, 2015 – Alamy\nA brisk walk or hike can really get your heart racing – but the prospect of doing that in the cold and rain doesn’t exactly inspire commitment to healthy living goals. At this time of year, everything is more tolerable when you have the appropriate kit. A properly warm coat can turn a dog walk into something truly uplifting. City pavements, treacherous when slick with rain, are barely noticeable in grippy, waterproof boots. And sub-zero temperatures? No problem when your head is cosseted in a cosy snood.\nAnne Hathaway at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival – Bryan Steffy/GC Images\nIt’s not all substance over style either; there’s plenty of outerwear that looks good and performs well, and this marriage can have huge potential as a mood-lifter during SAD season. Nobody understands this better than Georgia Dant, founder of the luxury modular outerwear brand Marfa Stance. ‘For me, the idea of bleak weather is kind of exciting,’ she says.\n‘I wanted to create something that allowed others to feel that way, because you can customise your coat depending on how cold it is.\n‘You can add a hood that’s bright fuchsia, or switch it for a pastel collar. These are things that I think make it a joyful experience when you’re dressing for the outdoors, because you have these layers that create warmth, but also add to your look.’\nMarfa Stance – CATHY KASTERINE\nAdidas x Spezial\nOf course, you don’t need to splash out on a new winter coat to imbue your cold-weather wardrobe with a bit of life if you already have one that does the job. Well-chosen accessories can deliver plenty of joy on their own. Consider the comfort of a scarf so big you can lose yourself in it, or the reassuring feel of boots in which you could walk for miles, or the colour-block hat that somehow transforms your tired face into one that’s rather photogenic.\nOversized scarves make a splash on the Adeam runway during New York Fashion Week – Getty\nAnd it’s all going to be on sale any second now, because retailers seem to be under the impression that spring is imminent – even April showers are some way off.\nGreat outerwear in inclement weather can make you feel unstoppable – which, as we set out our intentions for 2024, is a sentiment we can all get on board with.\nCosy staples\nCold weather clothes\nQuilted wax jacket, £475, Barbour x Ganni; Alpaca blend scarf, £190, Holzweiler\nCold weather clothes\nCashmere gloves, £69, Gobi Cashmere; Cashmere pom pom beanie, £184, Helen Kaminski; Leather boots, £285, Fracap at Toast\nCold weather clothes\nInsulated hard shell jacket, £354, Cortazu; Leather hiking boots, £140, Salomon\nCold weather clothes\nMerino wool scarf, £110, Sheep Inc; Lambswool hat, £95, Le Bonnet; Wool blend socks, £24.99, Pairs Scotland\n%n\nDiscover Telegraph Wine Cellar’s new wine club.
