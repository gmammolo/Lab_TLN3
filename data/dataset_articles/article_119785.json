  "text": "Chilly and dry start to 2024 in Vermont, New York As we say goodbye to 2023, Mother Nature appears to be providing a welcome change in weather for the New Year's weekend in the North Country and Vermont. After a dreary end to the year, excitement is building for brighter skies and better conditions as we welcome 2024. On Saturday, some snow showers should be expected for the first part of the day. During the afternoon, a few leftover flurries are possible but will dissipate leading to drier conditions by evening time. New Year's Eve will be mostly cloudy and chilly. Highs in the valleys in the low 30s with upper 20s for the mountains. For outdoor festivities happening in the evening, bundle up! Temperatures will be in the teens and 20s by midnight, with a westerly breeze between 5-10 mph. On New Year's Day, expect a few more breaks in the clouds, but do not let the brighter weather fool you, afternoon highs struggle to get out of the 20s. The first week of 2024 looks to be rather dry and tranquil for the time being. No frigid air or storms are expected. Follow the NBC5 First Warning Weather team on social media:",
