  "text": "During this time of year, many of us start getting dry hands and whilst it may not be an issue for some, for other it can be quite painful especially if they are in a job where they need to keep washing their hands.\nThankfully though,\nAmazon shoppers have come across one cream that is helping to tackle this issue. And it comes in at a budget-friendly price. Costing under a tenner, the O'Keeffe's Working Hands Eczema Relief Hand Cream is said to ‘work miracles’ on dry, cracked hands and not only that, it's hailed as being good for skin conditions like eczema.\nWhile there are many moisturising products on the market that are designed to combat\ndry hands, especially during this time of year, many shoppers have shared that this works better than any they have tried before.\nREAD MORE:\nAmazon eczema 'miracle' cream that costs £9 perfect for cold weather\nREAD MORE:\nMarks and Spencer's £14 oodie alternative that has people 'turning off heating'\nThe\nO'Keeffe's Working Hands Eczema Relief Hand Cream is priced at £9.49 and comes in a 57g tube marketed for those with 'extremely dry, itchy, irritated hands'. Designed for daily use specifically to treat dry hand conditions, this cream is steroid-free, dermatologically tested and is said to give the wearer 48 hours of itch relief in one use.\nOn the\nAmazon website, the product listing states: “Our formula provides 48-hour itch relief in just 1 use, leaving your skin feeling soft and comfortable. It locks in moisture, instantly hydrates & replenishes moisture levels, resulting in skin that feels soft, and comfortable, with a visibly improved appearance.”\nAnd with an overall star rating 4.7 out of 5 stars on its website from a whopping 83,839 ratings, shoppers seem to be loving the magic this cream seems to work. One shopper wrote: “Working outside a lot during the winter my hands would frequently dry out to the point the skin would crack and bleed. This stuff fixed them right up. My hands are softer and my skin no longer resembles an abused Iguana. I would highly recommend it.”\nAnother, who claimed it was a miracle worker, said: “O'Keeffe's Working Hands Cream is a true hand-saving miracle in a jar. As someone who frequently deals with dry, cracked skin due to constant handwashing and exposure to harsh weather, this cream has been a game-changer. Its non-greasy, quick-absorbing formula means you can apply it and get back to work without leaving a residue on everything you touch.\"\nSign up to our daily Edinburgh Live\nnewsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox\nA third penned: “I have eczema in my hands. I've tried every lotion and hand cream possible. This is it! It's super lightweight, easily absorbed, and makes my hands smooth and keeps the itchiness away! Will definitely order more.\"\nAnd a fourth shared: “I get very dry, cracked hands with small cuts and splits from working as a chef. This cream works miracles. Stings a little bit when on an open split but heals them up so quickly and gets rid of the dryness after one use. Won't be using anything else going forward.”\n- Try your 30 day free Amazon Prime trial\nHERE\nWhile many loved the product , there were some who found it hard to get on with, claiming it to be too sticky or greasy. One shopper said: “Used this before and didn't like it but that was a few years ago. I thought it may be better but it hasn't changed. It's soft but you can feel it on your hands the next day.”\nAnd another said: “Whilst it does make your skin soft, it leaves a residue all over your hands, meaning it's only really good before you go to bed.”\nIf you want to try the\nO'Keeffe's hand cream but don’t want to wait for delivery then Boots has the exact same hand cream which also costs £9.49. Or if you’re not looking to spend that much then there are cheaper options including the Garnier Intensive 7 Day Shea Butter hand cream which costs £3.33.",
