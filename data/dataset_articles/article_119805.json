  "text": "Finally, the Golden State’s forecast maps are pinging with promises of fresh rain in the Bay Area and snow in the Sierra before the start of the New Year. The Sierra snow forecast in particular comes as welcome news to skiers after an otherwise disappointing start to the season. In the Bay Area, a trough of rain from the Pacific is expected to drift in by Friday afternoon, dumping up to an inch and a half of rain in San Francisco and Oakland, and an inch or less in large portions of San Jose. By Saturday morning, the storm will peter out into a few scattered showers which will dissipate by the early afternoon. How much rain will you get in the next three days? Search your address in the map below to see how much rain is expected in your 72 hour forecast. Click the map to see rain forecasts at that spot. Click the plus to zoom in, and the minus button to zoom out. Meanwhile, many portions of the Sierra will get fresh snow Friday night and throughout much of Saturday as the Pacific storm sweeps east. Some higher elevations around Yosemite Valley may get 10 or more inches of snow. Meanwhile, South Lake Tahoe is forecast to get an inch or two of fresh snow, while mountain peaks nearby could get considerably more, up to foot or more. Some of the major ski resorts, like Palisades Tahoe, are forecast to get around 6 inches of snow. Search your address in the live snow forecast map below to see how much snow is expected in your 72 hour forecast. Click the plus to zoom in, and the minus button to zoom out.",
