  "text": "West Bromwich Albion moved to within three points of play-off rivals Leeds United with another excellent Hawthorns victory and performance on Friday night. Grady Diangana's goal in the first half was enough to separate the two sides and give Albion breathing space to the chasing back beneath them. [Albion ](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc)were slow out of the traps, against a side who - on paper, at least - look like they've been created on a Fantasy Championship app. Cedric Kipre and Darnell Furlong both had to perform crucial bits of defending at different moments, as did Semi Ajayi when he recovered to deny Georginio Rutter in the penalty area. Leeds thought they were ahead when Sam Byram plundered at the back post, but he was rightly flagged for offside. That rather woke Albion up, and slowly the pendulum of momentum began to swing towards them. Jayson Molumby might've opened the scoring when he connected with Jed Wallace's centre, only to be denied with a block. Karl Darlow, standing in for Leeds' number one Ilan Meslier, who is suspended, failed to claim a corner and Kipre's eventual prod towards goal was cleared off the line by Djed Spence, before Okay Yokuslu somehow spooned the rebound over the bar, but Albion made the all important breakthrough when the Turkish midfielder delivered an incisive pass for Wallace and he teed up Diangana who did the rest at the second attempt. Albion began the second half the better, picking up where they'd left off, but they couldn't force an early second goal which would've really pushed Leeds against the buffers. On the hour mark, Daniel Farke threw on Patrick Bamford, Dan James and Jaidon Anthony in an attempt to force the issue. That sparked a period of pressure. Naturally, when you're chasing the game and your manager throws caution to the wind with his system and selection of personnel, Leeds were going to come on strong with their embarrassment of attacking riches. By comparison, Albion began to feel the effects. Wallace, brilliant again here, ran himself into the ground until he could give no more and was forced off. Slowly, Albion became more more conservative and with their changes, too; Diangana, Thomas-Asante and Molumby came off, while the likes of Nathaniel Chalobah and Kyle Bartley were introduced. There were hairy moments, as Kipre headed over his bar with Bamford awaiting to stoop home a cross just behind him. The final few moments were what you might've expected; bodies on the line, but a sheer will to win to a man, to not concede and dent another promotion rival's hopes in the process. West Brom player ratings Palmer 8 Had to beat away a bending Summerville shot, Leeds' only on target in the first half. Did come for a corner in the second half and missed. Other than that, though, Palmer was decisive when coming for the ball and communicative with his defenders. Furlong 8 Had some work to do in the opening stages and in one situation dealt expertly with the threat of Summerville on the edge of the box. Won a couple of huge headers at the death to help get Albion over the line. Ajayi 9 A big night for Ajayi, who was brought into the side in place of Bartley to help combat the pace and trickery of Leeds' attack. An aerial presence in both boxes and some immense skill which pleased the East Stand when he went on an adventure. An outstanding presence. Kipre 9 Made one significant block in the early moments when Leeds progressed into the Albion box. Might've opened the scoring but his effort was cleared off the line. Colossal at the back in the closing stages, winning everything. Townsend 8 It's not been an easy few weeks for the left-back, who struggled particularly at Middlesbrough, but this was Townsend back at the levels we expect from him. An outlet on the left throughout and had the unenviable task of half an hour of Dan James, but he blunted that blade. Yokuslu 9* Magnificent through ball sliced Leeds open at the back and, from it, came the opening goal. Should've scored himself, when he prodded over an open goal from yards out. Constantly pushing himself and others, disclosing his frustrations when things don't come off, something which is visible. A mammoth showing, Yokuslu at his best. Mowatt 7 The sort of night Mowatt would relish, against his former club. Not his usual game, in the sense that he didn't see as much of the ball, or was allowed to be as influential in running the game, as he was on Boxing Day. Lot of hard work and plenty of effort. Molumby 7 Brought into the side to help manage Swift but also to inject more energy and pressing intensity higher up the pitch, and he went about his business in his custom style, too. When an attempt to return a corner started a Leeds break, Molumby recovered appropriately. Diangana 8 Drifted inside a couple of times to switch the play. Right place at the right time to bag the opening goal. Some momentary brilliance as he gave a couple of pink shirts the slip down the left hand side to the delight of the fans, but ran into some cul-de-sacs too. A nice parting gift before he leaves for AFCON. Wallace 8 A menace for Sam Byram down the right hand side and he helped to create the opening goal for Diangana. Always the outlet with his pace and willingness to make runs and was often found by Yokuslu. Ran himself into the ground, which ultimately forced him off. Thomas-Asante 8 No goal here, but Thomas-Asante was excellent. Pretty punishing and unrewarding task as the first line of defence in the second half here, against a side who dominated the ball and were in search of a goal, but Albion's forward ran himself into the ground, dropped short, linked play and relieved pressure. Substitutes Swift (for Diangana 69) 7 An important cameo. Teed up Reach with brilliant vision and execution of a pass over the top. Glided around when in possession but important shift defensively. Bartley (for Molumby 69) 7 Like Swift, Bartley's match fitness and nous at the back, as well as his aerial prowess, was a werlcome introduction and he slotted in seamlessly. Reach (for Wallace 70) 7 First game back since April, sent on to do a defensive job. Might've secured it with an ambitious lob which Darlow held. Chalobah (for Mowatt 76) Sarmiento (for Thomas-Asante 86) Substitutes not used: Griffiths, Pieters, Pipa, Fellows Leeds United: Darlow, Spence (Anthony 60), Rodon, Cooper, Byram (James 60); Ampadu (Joseph 90), Gruev; Gnonto (Bamford 60), Piroe, Summerville (Firpo 90); Rutter Substitutes not used: Klaesson, Cresswell, Kamara, Gray GOALS Albion - Diangana 37; Leeds - The ref: Graham Scott Up next: Swansea City (A) - Monday, 1 January, 3pm kick off",
