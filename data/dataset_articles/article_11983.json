  "text": "Right after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi hinted in November last year at the possibility of Japan’s involvement in the event of a Taiwan contingency, Japan’s tourism industry appears to have begun shaking from the ground up.According to the Asahi Shimbun and others on the 14th, Japan’s Ministry of Finance announced that the travel balance surplus in November 2025 was tallied at 452.4 billion yen (about 4.2 trillion won). Compared with the same period in 2024 (558 billion yen), it fell about 19%. In nominal terms it remains a large surplus, but the slowdown in profitability was clear.Monthly statistics from the Ministry of Finance show that Japan’s tourism industry performed well throughout the summer peak season. With the yen weak throughout the year, the surplus widened year over year during peak season. But in November, the surplus shrank sharply from a year earlier. That coincides exactly with the timing of Takaichi’s remark that “in the event of a cross-strait contingency, Japan could face an existential crisis that compels the exercise of collective self-defense.”After the remark on Nov. 7 last year, the Chinese government issued a message urging its citizens to be cautious about traveling to Japan. Since then, demand for travel from China to Japan has slowed sharply. China has previously pressured counterpart countries during diplomatic disputes by restricting group tours or taking administrative measures related to travel. The restrictions during the Senkaku Islands dispute in 2012 and the controversy over the release of Fukushima wastewater in 2023 are representative examples.This time, with all-out pressure blocking the air routes themselves, the entire Japanese tourism industry is shaking. According to the local Chubu Shimbun on the 15th, as of this month the cancellation rate on Japan-China routes has reached 40.4%.Regional airports sustained by Chinese tourist demand are on the brink of collapse. Sendai Airport and Shizuoka Airport have seen their China routes wiped out. The situation at Chubu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya), the gateway to Japan’s Chubu region, is also serious. Until November last year there were 72 weekly flights from Nagoya to China, which fell to 56 in December. This month the number plunged to 26. In two months, 64% disappeared. As a result, the number of weekly international flights at Chubu Airport has remained below the 300 mark for two consecutive months.The sharp drop in flights immediately led to a collapse in prices at tourist destinations. According to Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) statistics, the number of Chinese visitors to Japan fell from 715,000 in October to 562,600 in November, when Takaichi made the remark. In just one month, more than 150,000 people, or 21%, stopped coming.Lodgings in scenic spots with a high share of Chinese tourists, such as Kyoto and Kamakura, are feeling the slowdown in demand. Hotel room rates in central Kyoto that averaged 20,000 yen (about 180,000 won) per night have now fallen below 10,000 yen (about 90,000 won). In some less popular areas, rooms priced at 3,000 yen (about 27,000 won) have even appeared. Even so, booking rates remain low. The South China Morning Post (SCMP), citing an industry source, reported, “It’s not so much that the average booking price itself has collapsed, but that there has been an increase in temporary discounts and special offers to fill gaps in demand.”According to a Japan Tourism Agency survey on spending trends of foreign visitors to Japan, as of the first quarter last year, the average amount a Chinese tourist spent on shopping during a visit to Japan was 106,000 yen (about 989,000 won). That was the highest among major visitor countries.By contrast, South Korean tourists tend to have shorter stays and spend more on food trips and experiences, so per capita spending is relatively low. During the same period, South Korean tourists’ per capita spending was around 50,000 yen (about 460,000 won), about half that of Chinese visitors.Looking at total spending by foreign visitors to Japan as of the third quarter last year, Chinese accounted for 27.7%, the highest share. South Koreans were at 9.7%, about one-third of the Chinese share. That means it is difficult to fully fill the gap left by Chinese tourists with visitors from other countries such as South Korea or Taiwan.The retail industry is also feeling the impact of fewer Chinese tourists. At Takashimaya, Japan’s largest department store group, Chinese customers account for 58% of total duty-free sales. At Daimaru Matsuzakaya Department Stores, the share rises to 66%. As Chinese tourists stopped coming, duty-free sales at these department stores fell more than 10% from a year earlier.A Daimaru Department Store official said in an interview with the Japan Times, “The number of South Korean customers has increased, but they tend to buy clothing and food rather than high-priced items such as luxury watches or jewelry,” adding, “In terms of sales aggregates, it is close to impossible for South Koreans to fill the gap left by Chinese customers.”Experts said the situation will be hard to resolve in the short term. Kiuchi Takahide, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute (NRI), projected, “If the mood of refraining from traveling to Japan persists in China for a year, Japan’s nominal GDP could shrink by about 1.79 trillion yen (about 16.6 trillion won).” He added, “A freeze in China-Japan diplomacy will be a factor dragging Japan’s economic growth rate down by more than 0.3 percentage points in 2026,” and, “This episode shows how large the expense can be when political conviction outweighs economic benefit.”The Japanese government is hurriedly rolling out policies to diversify tourists. The plan is to reduce dependence on China by expanding efforts to attract tourists from Southeast Asia and Europe. But many in the industry point to practical limits. An airline industry official said, “In terms of geographic accessibility, population size, and purchasing power, there is no country that can replace the Chinese market in the short term,” adding, “European tourists face limits on visit frequency due to long flight times, and Southeast Asian tourists do not have purchasing power comparable to China.”",
