  "text": "{h2}Sunshine for weekend{/h2}{p}The final weekend of 2023 is calm and pleasant for the central Gulf Coast. After a start in the middle 30s, our Saturday will feature blue skies, sunshine, light wind, and highs in the middle{ } 50s. Sunday morning starts in the middle and upper 30s but warms further, to the lower or middle 60s. It will be an outstanding New Year's Eve with abundant sunshine.{br}{/p}{p}Sunday evening remains dry and calm. With a light southwesterly wind, we'll gradually see clouds increase overnight, heading into New Year's Day. At the stroke of midnight, temperatures should be near 50 degrees. New Year's Day has showers over about a third of the area, by late afternoon. Highs will still be in the lower 60s. Plan for daily changes after that with Tuesday being sunny, dry and cool, and Wednesday bring more rain, before we dry out for Thursday.{/p}{p}{strong}Chief Meteorologist Alan Sealls{/strong}{/p}{p}NBC 15-area forecasts from the National Weather Service - {a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.weather.gov/mob/marine",
