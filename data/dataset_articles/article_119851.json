  "text": "Antarctic ozone hole in September 2023 – Copernicus Madrid, 29 December. (Europa Press) – 2023 The Antarctic ozone hole finally closed on December 20, becoming one of the largest in mid-September and Seventh longest observation ever. Reasons for this behavior point to climate change or volcanic emissions, but the exact causes are not yet known. according to a statement of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere’s polar stratosphere increased due to reduced precipitation and winds, Due to which the polar vortex broke, Which helped in the recovery of the ozone layer in the area. 2023 southern hemisphere [#ozonelead]Ultimately closed on December 20, and becoming the 7th longest-lived [#CopernicanEnvironment]record. The animation shows the evolution from its beginning in August to its late close. Learn more:https://t.co/OkXiCxyIGG [pic.twitter.com/2HGV0C1DLs] – Copernicus ECMWF (@CopernicusECMWF) [29 December 2023] ozone hole of 2023 This soon attracted the attention of experts. Due to its early onset, mid-September witnessed one of the largest ozone holes of any year. The area of the ozone hole subsequently shrank to about average, but persisted unusually through November, remaining over 14.2 million square kilometers by early December, approximately the area of Antarctica. CAMS became the third largest for the time of year on record. The closing process then began, with several counterattacks delaying final closing until 20 December. The longest-lasting ozone hole in the 1979 data record was in 1999 and 2020; Both lasted till 27 December. This is the fourth year in a row that the ozone hole in the Southern Hemisphere has seen strange behaviorDespite global success in banning ozone-depleting substances. Researchers suggest that the eruption of the Hanga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano in early 2022, which injected huge amounts of water vapor into the stratosphere, could influence the extent and intensity of ozone depletion in 2023. Other experts suggest that the positive period could have been delayed by the southern annular mode. “Last Stratospheric Warming” Which normally closes the ozone hole, breaking the polar vortex. The new research also points to long-term atmospheric dynamics known since the early 2000s as a possible driver of the large ozone holes seen in recent years, suggesting the potential effects of climate change. Although research has progressed significantly in recent years, there are still gaps in knowledge of the exact chemical and dynamic processes and interactions with other layers, Because of the difficulties in obtaining observations in this remote region of our atmosphere. The ozone layer is located in the stratosphere between 15 and 30 km altitude. Protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, scientists showed that Substances that deplete the ozone layer, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), The accumulation of substances in the stratosphere was causing seasonal thinning of the ozone layer in the Southern Hemisphere, the ozone hole. Substances that deplete the ozone layer were banned by the Montreal Protocol in 1987. But chlorinated and brominated gases emitted before the ban will persist in the atmosphere for decades.",
