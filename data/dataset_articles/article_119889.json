  "text": "Cold weather shelter providing welcoming warmth\nCold weather shelter providing welcoming warmth\nIf you’re in Fort Pierce and in need of a place to stay during the cold snap, an emergency warming shelter is available this weekend at Percy Peek Gym. The shelter is offering a warm place to stay and hot meals for those seeking refuge from the mid-40s temperatures on the Treasure Coast. Walk-ins are welcome, and the Treasure Coast Homeless Council will be providing long-term services to help people get back on their feet.\nTransforming the Gym into a Shelter\nAs the sun went down in Fort Pierce, Dominque Cain-Douglas with the “In the Image of Christ” nonprofit helped to transform the gym into a cold weather shelter. They are providing shelter, hot showers, breakfast, lunch, and dinner for those in need, making an effort to make people feel welcome and at home.\nThis is not just a shelter,” Cain-Douglas said. “We actually try our best to make people feel welcome, to make them feel at home and as we are a family.”",
