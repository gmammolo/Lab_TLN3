  "text": "FORT PIERCE, Fla. — If you're in Fort Pierce and you or someone you know needs a place to stay during the cold snap, an emergency warming shelter is open this weekend.\nWith temperatures on the Treasure Coast expected to be in the mid-40s, Percy Peek Gym is making sure those in need have a warm place to stay and also a hot meal.\nWarren Stapleton was the first to use one of the 100 spots available at the shelter through the weekend.\nTreasure Coast\nWarming shelters open up across Treasure Coast amid cold spell Kate Hussey 4:38 PM, Dec 29, 2023\nWPTV Warren Stapleton was among those staying at the cold weather shelter in Fort Pierce on Dec. 29, 2023. \"When you heard about the weather this weekend what went through your mind?\" asked WPTV reporter Joel Lopez.\n\"I'm gonna freeze to death sleeping out in a wheelchair with shorts and a T-shirt on,\" Stapleton said.\nHe said a work-related accident left him homeless.\n\"I'm trying to get back on my feet and get things moving again, but it's really difficult when you're on your own, handicapped and disabled and trying to get some help,\" Stapleton said.\nAs the sun went down in Fort Pierce on Friday, Dominque Cain-Douglas with the \"In the Image of Christ\" nonprofit helped to transform the gym into a cold weather shelter.\nWPTV Dominque Cain-Douglas shares with WPTV reporter Joel Lopez what services the temporary cold weather shelter will provide for those in need this weekend in Fort Pierce. \"We're here for the community for us to be open providing shelter, hot showers, breakfast, lunch and dinner,\" Cain-Douglas said.\nThey said this is a resource they've provided for more than 10 years. However, they need donations for items like hygiene products, towels and clothes so people like Stapleton can stay warm.\n\"So they put me out this nice Columbia long-sleeve shirt, and it's perfect for me,\" Stapleton said.\nThey said walk-ins are welcome and the Treasure Coast Homeless Council will be stopping by to offer long-term services to help people get back on their feet.\n\"This is not just a shelter,\" Cain-Douglas said. \"We actually try our best to make people feel welcome, to make them feel at home and as we are a family.\"\nClick here for more on the shelter's hours and transportation information.\nBelow is a full list of shelters available along the Treasure Coast this weekend:\nRegion Indian River County\nIndian River County to open 3 cold weather shelters Scott Sutton 8:01 PM, Dec 28, 2023\nRegion Okeechobee County\nWarming center to open in Okeechobee County Scott Sutton 3:51 PM, Dec 29, 2023\nRegion St Lucie County\nCold weather shelter to open this weekend in Fort Pierce Scott Sutton 10:49 PM, Dec 27, 2023",
