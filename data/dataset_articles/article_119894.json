  "text": "Friday, December 29th 2023, 10:20 pm As we move into the weekend, we will see more sunshine with gradually warming temperatures. A stronger storm is starting to show up for the weekend after next with rain and snow possible. 50's are likely on Saturday with much lighter wind making for the best day in a while. Another cold front comes in on Sunday and will chill things off again to start the new year. We will also be watching for another storm passing by on Wednesday. Some data brings snow into OKC while other data says we are dry. What is this winter supposed to look like? Watch Chief Meteorologist David Payne's winter weather forecast [here.](https://www.news9.com/story/655584a97f3052056bdc96ae/get-ready-for-snow-david-paynes-winter-weather-forecast-for-oklahoma) What Are The Lake Levels In Oklahoma? To keep track of Oklahoma lake levels, click [here](https://www.lakelevels.info/USA/Oklahoma/). It's important to protect your pipes from the cold. Safety officials recommend protecting outside pipes by disconnecting garden hoses from your house and installing covers on outside faucets. Also, if a sink is along an outside wall of your home, allow a trickle of water to run and open the cabinet doors to allow warm air to circulate. The National Weather Service says when temperatures drop to 28°F or lower for a couple of hours you should bring pets indoors, protect sensitive vegetation, protect outdoor pipes and let indoor faucets drip and to turn off automatic sprinklers. If you're using a space heater, make sure it's not too close to things that can burn like upholstered furniture, clothing, a mattress, or bedding. Never plug a space heater into an extension cord, always plug it directly into a wall outlet. Remember to turn it off before leaving the room or going to bed. Keep it out of the reach of children and pets. Look for signs of malfunctions, especially on older models. Make sure it has an automatic shutoff function. Make sure you have working smoke detectors with fresh batteries. Change the battery twice a year. On average, fires caused by portable heaters cause 65 deaths and 150 injuries a year, according to the US Fire Administration. Overnight on Sunday, firefighters battled several house fires across Oklahoma as temperatures dropped below freezing. Follow the News 9 Meteorologists on Facebook!
