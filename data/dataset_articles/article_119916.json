  "text": "Top 5 European cities for the perfect winter trip\nTraveling in winter is a real pleasure. Fluffy blankets of white snow and bright lanterns decorating houses create a surprisingly festive atmosphere. If you don't miss the sun and warmth but need a vacation, you should go on a tour right now. Moreover, some European cities are best visited in winter.\nInterlaken, Switzerland\nThis is a very small town located between two lakes: Thun and Brienz. The settlement itself is surrounded by snow-capped mountain peaks, so the ski season begins here in November. This is one of the country's tourist centers, which has relatively low prices compared to other resorts. It is also not too crowded with tourists.\nIn addition to the winding slopes, there are many attractions worth seeing. Of course, you need to climb the two famous mountains: Harder Kulm and Jungfrau. There, among the clouds, the hills offer incredible views. No photos can convey the beauty of this panorama. If you are here, be sure to visit the Ice Palace, where all the exhibits are made of ice. Walk the Golden Pass route, go on an excursion to the Beatus Caves, and visit as many restaurants as possible. You will be impressed by their interior and delicious cuisine.\nStrasbourg, France\nThe city at the crossroads will surprise you with its atmosphere. Every street, house or shop window is beautifully decorated for the New Year. Even after the holidays, a special mood reigns here for a long time. No wonder it is also called the Christmas capital of Europe.\nIf you get here before the New Year, be sure to head to the central square. A 25-meter-high Christmas tree is set up here and fairs to sell goodies, warming drinks, and souvenirs are organized.\nStrasbourg is located on the border with Germany. As you can imagine, this could not but affect the architecture and traditions of the locals. Go to the Petite France neighborhood, visit the Notre Dame Cathedral, and stroll along the covered bridges. You will definitely enjoy it.\nInnsbruck, Austria\nA small snow-covered settlement that is hidden among the proud Alps. It is a real paradise for winter sports enthusiasts. Despite its size, it receives thousands of visitors every year.\nIf you're not a fan of steep slopes or any kind of activity at all, no problem. There is plenty of entertainment for those who come just for the company. First, take a stroll along the medieval Mariahilferstrasse and leisurely walk to the house with the golden roof. The building was built in the XV century, and the roof was decorated with gilded plates. Be sure to go inside the building, where the historical museum is located.\nAnother must-see location is the Ambras Castle, built in the Renaissance style. By the way, it houses an art gallery and an exhibition of weapons. If you have children, we recommend visiting the one-of-a-kind zoo. It is located at an altitude of 750 meters above sea level. You can get here by cable car.\nEdinburgh, Scotland\nAnother European city that is better to visit in winter. During the New Year holidays, it turns into a fairy-tale illustration. Just imagine: the medieval streets are decorated with thousands of lanterns that flicker in different colors.\nWe advise you to get ready for a tour of the Edinburgh Outpost. It was built on top of a prehistoric volcano. There are many museums inside the fortress where you can learn more about the history of the region.\nWe also recommend visiting the official residence of the monarchs: the Holyrood Palace. All state-level celebrations still take place here. Only Mary Stuart's chambers, the throne room, the royal apartments, and the morning drawing room are open to tourists.\nStockholm, Sweden\nA city of gingerbread houses, bright colors, and beautiful architecture. You forget about everything in the world here because you won't find such views anywhere else in Europe. You should start your trip from Stockholm City Hall, from which you can see the whole capital as if it were in the palm of your hand.\nIf you like to visit unusual places, go to the ABBA Museum. It is worth a visit not only for fans of the famous band but also for everyone who loves music. Here, you can virtually try on the performers' costumes, become the fifth member of the famous four, and sing with them on stage.\nTry to set yourself a goal of going around all the exhibition halls in Stockholm. There are a lot of them, and they are all different. Don't forget to take a walk in Gamla Stan, the historic center of the city.\nWinter travel is especially atmospheric and beautiful. There is no bad season, they are all wonderful, so don't be afraid to take tickets and go on a trip right now.\nEarlier, OBOZ.UA told you\nwhether Ukrainians travel during the war.\nOnly verified information is available on our Obozrevatel\nTelegram and Viber.
