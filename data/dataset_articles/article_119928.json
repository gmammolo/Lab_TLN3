[DOWNLOAD: [Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks](https://www.wsbtv.com/smart-tv/)] Although the snow was short-lived, Jasper residents said the cold and frost were welcomed. “Oh yes, I do love the snow. It’s beautiful to look at,” Jasper resident Savanna Teples told Spruill. “On my way in from work, I saw a few flurries here and there. There was a lot of ice falling instead of the flurries, not much snow.” Severe Weather Team 2 Meteorologist Jennifer Lopez said Friday morning that parts of north Georgia could see a dusting, with the highest elevations seeing up to a half inch.

It is exciting, especially with the kids being on school break. They might be able to enjoy some white cap.” Back in Jasper, the snow dipped out too soon.
