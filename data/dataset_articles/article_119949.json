  "text": "(The Shopping List)\nThese Cozy Hats Are My Ultimate Winter Weather Accessory\nDon’t sleep on these styles.\nDespite being an October baby, winter has become my favorite season. Don’t get me wrong, I still like fall. The\nvampy makeup, knee boots, and earthy colors are always welcomed come September. But with prolonged summer seasons becoming more the norm, I’m beginning to appreciate the coldest months of the year. The main reason? The fashion, of course. While I enjoy changing up my outerwear looks, it’s the cozy accessories that I’ve come to love most. And at the top of my list are comfy winter hats. No matter what coat I decide on, I’ve found that having a couple of head covers to play with keeps things interesting.\nTo be fair, I love a good hat regardless of the time of year. But the options for winter just hit differently. Beanies, for example, are one of my go-to cold-weather staples. Yes, they keep my head and ears toasty, but they also come in a\nrainbow of colors that instantly brighten any look. Caps of all sorts are another of my seasonal go-to’s. A sporty, wool five-panel never fails me, whether I’m pairing it with a car coat or cropped puffer. Sailer, cabbie, and newsboy styles are also well-beloved and have become a favorite for denim outfits with sweaters and nubby scarves.\nOver the years, I’ve grown my collection winter hats and look forward to digging through them all when the weather finally permits. Still, I’m always keeping an eye out for something new. Below are a few of the hat options that are currently on my radar.\nGrace Eleyae Everyday Beanie$44I love beanies but they aren’t too kind to my hair. The wooly material can cause breakage, and during a season when I feel my hair is at its most vulnerable, that’s the last thing I need. Enter this satin-lined option. It protects my hair and is Black woman-owned — a winning combo in my book. Free PeopleOver My Ribbed Balaclava$48To be honest, I’m still getting into balaclavas. But this bubblegum knit from Free People has me ready to dive in head first. The looser fit is reminiscent of a scarf, lightly wrapped around the head, and the shoestring-like ties remind me of a cozy hoodie. I can easily see myself pairing it with everything from a bubble coat to fur. Câbleami Boa Aviator Hat In Olive$155There’s something so cool about this trapper hat — the earthy color, the fuzzy ear flaps, and the rustic suede string that keeps them tightly secured. While I can almost guarantee I’d wear it as is, it’s nice to have the option to drop the flaps for some extra warmth.",
