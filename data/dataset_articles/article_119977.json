  "text": "There’s another huge jackpot on offer\nThe National Lottery’s last jackpot of 2023 is a must-be won £15 million prize. This means there could be multiple players taking home huge amounts of cash if no one matches all correct numbers.\nIn a Lotto Must Be Won draw where no one wins the jackpot by matching 6 main numbers, there’s a Rolldown. This means the jackpot is shared by players matching 2 or more main numbers, so thousands can expect to win a boosted cash prize.\nIt could mean several people enjoy a very good start to 2024. The money would change your life in an instant, allow you retire and even travel the world.\nTry BristolLive Premium for FREE with no ads and new features\nTo play the National Lottery, choose six numbers from one to 59 or choose a lucky dip. It costs £2 per play. There is also the chance to take home £500,000 in the Thunderball. This draw takes place at 8:15pm and offers players better odds of winning.\nIn an average week players raise £34 million for National Lottery projects the length and breadth of the UK. And during an average week, the National Lottery’s call centre staff will confirm to SIX people that they have won a prize of £1 million or more.\nAnd winners are given the chance to take financial advice from Coutts &Co – the same bank used by the Royal Family.\nTonight’s winning Lotto numbers: 15, 26, 29, 37, 49, 53 Bonus ball: 38\nWinning Thunderball numbers:\nThe National Lottery has urged players to check their tickets after a Thunderball prize of £500,000 remains unclaimed. The lucky punter purchased the ticket in Redditch – but is yet to come forward since the draw took place on December 8.",
