  "text": "It’s not going to rain — or snow– on this party. The estimated 1 million revelers set to pour into Times Square to ring in 2024 will be treated to comfortable, dry weather, forecasters said. Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, around 40 degrees, with a light breeze and some clouds around midnight, according to forecasters, but nothing that will obscure the Times Square Ball or celebratory fireworks. New Year’s Day will be in the mid-40’s with some clouds, too and the first week of the new year will be cool and clear, too. “It will generally be a pretty good day for both New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day for New York for this time of year,” said Fox Weather meteorologist Marissa Lautenbacher. After a wet week along most of the northeast, most of the region will also be in the clear for Sunday and Monday, making for easy post-holiday travel. Parts of the West Coast are likely to see continued rain and snow is expected to fall in the Appalachian Mountains and into the Adirondacks, according to meteorologists. The warmest temperatures the Big Apple ever saw for the ball drop was 58 degrees, which it reached when 1966 and 1973 were rung in, according to AccuWeather . The coldest ever was 1 degree on New Year’s Eve in 1917. There is no snow forecast yet for 2024 as Saturday marked the city’s 685th day of its snow drought.",
