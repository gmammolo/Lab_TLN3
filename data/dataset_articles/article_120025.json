  "text": "Watch live as New Zealand's largest city welcomes 2024 with a dazzling fireworks display at Auckland's Sky Tower. As the clock strikes midnight, Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland will be the first major city in the world to welcome in the New Year. The five-minute-long fireworks display, which is the highest in the Southern Hemisphere, will start with a 10-second countdown projected onto the base of the Sky Tower. Following this, 500kgs of pyrotechnics will be launched from three purpose-built firing sites mounted onto levels 55, 61 and 64 - around 200-240m above ground. Planning of the fireworks display started six months ago, with pre-production and programming of the firing field computers and address signal boxes. The installation of the equipment required for the big event will take over 250 hours and includes 14km of electrical cabling and wiring and 1500 lines of programming code. PyroStar International owner Robert McDermott helped set up the display. He told 1News that the unique thing about the Sky Tower celebration is people can \"stand underneath\" the display near the tower because the special products used \"burn out in flight\" Although McDermott has been helping organise the Sky Tower display for the last eight years, he admits he still gets nervous before the display kicks off at midnight. \"This is the only display in New Zealand which is shown internationally, so the world is watching. Auckland leads the way with the major cities in the world. There are a few smaller countries which come before it, but Auckland really is the focus.\" SkyCity chief operating officer, Callum Mallett says watching the fireworks cascade from the Sky Tower has become a tradition for many families: “It’s a time when people come together to celebrate the upcoming year and enjoy time with friends and family. The fireworks will be accompanied by a laser light and animation show inspired by the \"Auckland is Calling\" tomokanga, reflecting the 19 iwi of Tāmaki Makaurau and the weaving together of people, land and sea. The light show in Auckland will be synchronised with other iconic landmarks: the Harbour Bridge, Auckland Museum (Tāmaki Paenga Hira), and the Light Path (Te Ara I Whiti).",
