  "text": "CHUKAI, Dec 31 (Bernama) -- The easing of weather conditions in Terengganu provides much-needed relief to keropok keping ikan (dried fish crackers) traders here, as it has allowed them to go back to their daily routine, including drying the popular snack in the sun.\nMohd Bukhori Zainal Abidin, 50, was met by Bernama when he was flipping the dried thin slices of crackers, said that the supply at his shop has been affected, due to the incessant rain since the beginning of the month.\n“Compared with last year, this year has been worse, as the rainy season started at the same time as the school holiday. A large portion of the crackers were damaged by the rain. We can only dry them today.\n“Fortunately, we also stocked up early for sales this holiday season,” he said.\nHe added that a batch of crackers, weighing 50 kilogrammes (kg), can generate an income of RM900, and is in high demand among locals and visitors, especially during the holiday season.\n“Alhamdulillah, I really hope that it will be fine weather till evening. Crackers that we dried today can be sold tomorrow.\nEarlier today, Bernama reported that the third wave of flooding, which hit Terengganu starting on Dec 23, has now fully recovered.\nAccording to the Terengganu Disaster Management Committee (JPBNT) secretariat, the last temporary evacuation centre in the state at Dewan Serbaguna Taman Perumahan Wakaf Tengah in Kuala Nerus, which housed six people, was closed at 2 pm today.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 IFLIX channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial",
