  "text": "Status: 31.12.2023, 11:00 a.m.\nBy: Franziska Seliger\nCommentsPrint Share\nAt the end of August 2023, Benediktbeuern's headmaster Peter Mückstein (left) and Prime Minister Markus Söder (right) showed pictures of what the hail had done to the school building. Also in the picture is the mayor of Benediktbeuren, Anton Ortlieb (2nd from left) and his Bichler colleague Benedikt Pössenbacher (2nd from right). © Arp\nAt the meeting of the school association, Benediktbeuern's rector Peter Mückstein reported on hail damage and other challenges at the primary and secondary school of the monastery village. When it comes to digital equipment, there is good news.\nBenediktbeuern – The Benediktbeuern primary and secondary school was also badly damaged in the hailstorm at the end of August. At the most recent meeting of the school association, headmaster Peter Mückstein and mayor Anton Ortlieb in his function as chairman informed about the upcoming repair work, everyday life at the school and major challenges.\nHow the municipality, caretakers and even former students had helped together after the storm so that the new school year could start in the building \"relatively normally\" and not – as initially feared – in containers: \"From my point of view, that was great,\" said Mückstein. It \"gave the children a lot of stability\" that they had a certain degree of normality during their school day. For many, the storm caused immense damage at home. \"There was a lot of suffering. And so the school was a great point of stabilization.\"\nProperty damage to the roof of the school immense According to Ortlieb, the municipality, in consultation with the insurance company, has now commissioned an engineering firm to provide technical support for the renovation of the house. This is necessary because the damage is estimated to be in the \"high six-digit range\", possibly even in the seven-figure range. The tin roof of the school is particularly affected. Although this has been leaking so far, it still has to be completely redone, as joints in the metal are no longer intact. This measure is to be carried out during the 2024 summer holidays.\niPads for all sixth graders Mückstein also informed that the \"Digital School of the Future\" project was launched at his school in the fall. This is a two-year program of the Free State, in which the sixth grade is equipped with iPads. Benediktbeuern is the only secondary school in the district that has been awarded the contract. In the neighbouring district, the Penzberg secondary school came into play.\nParents received 300 euros per student to buy an iPad for their child with the help of this funding. \"The iPads will become the property of the parents,\" explained the headmaster. Since there were already around 40 tablets at the school, which are available to all classes, and the teachers have also been digitally upgraded, \"from my point of view, the school is very, very well equipped digitally at the moment.\"\nNumber of primary school pupils rises - Ortlieb assumes increasing number of inhabitants According to Mückstein, the number of pupils has stabilised and is even expected to increase slightly in the next few years. Recently, many students had left school, which had even endangered the continued existence of a class. The rector cited the \"great teaching\" of a teacher as the reason for this. As a result, the children had achieved such good grades that some of them switched to the M-branch at the Penzberg secondary school, with which his school maintains a good cooperation. At the Benediktbeuern secondary school, it is no longer possible to obtain the intermediate school leaving certificate via the so-called M-branch. In 2014, the M-classes of the ninth and tenth grades were moved to the neighboring city. For the next five years, the principal predicted a two-and-a-half-stream elementary school and a stable middle school enrollment.\nMy news \"How can you be so stupid\": Judge reprimands defendant's reading\n\"Something is supposed to be pushed through by force\": Heilbrunn is angry at the district office reading\nSharpened eye for local history: This is how the excellent seminar paper by Agnes Braun from Lenggrieslesen came about\nA Cigar Box Full of Billions in Estate Reading\nAfter joining the MVV: RVO guests in the direction of Garmisch look into the tubes\nLifesavers wanted: Typing campaign at indoor tournament in Tölzlesen\nMayor Ortlieb assumes that his village will become even more attractive as a place to live \"at the latest when the MVV joines\", which will also increase the number of pupils and the number of children in kindergarten. \"We are an influx region.\" The municipality could not control this influx, as there were still many vacant lots in the village, on the development of which it had no influence. \"All we can do is gallop along.\"\nBridge class for children from Ukraine remains According to Mückstein, the bridge class for the Loisach Valley will remain located at his school. The challenge is that while children from Ukraine have the right to attend these special classes, children from other countries do not. As a result, children from Syria or Afghanistan, who urgently need German lessons in the bridge class, \"sit in the regular classes\".\nThe topic of inclusion is becoming \"increasingly a major challenge\", according to Mückstein. The school is getting more and more children from the support centre, \"because word has got around that we differentiate very strongly and do it well\". The problem is that just because the school is accepting more and more children with special needs, it does not mean that it is getting additional teachers. \"This has to be handled by the normal staff,\" says Mückstein. The staffing situation is \"fortunately very good\" this school year. All classes could be staffed with trained teachers. Mückstein's conclusion: \"It's going well.\"\nMore news can be found in our brand new Merkur.de app, now in an improved design with more personalization functions.
