  "text": "This is the moment a climber is saved from a brutal -2C blizzard in the Scottish Highlands by a mountain team in a daring rescue. The video, shared on social media, shows emergency responders stretchering a female climber to safety after she became seperated from a group almost 4000 feet up in the Cairngorm mountains. She had raised the alarm by her mobile phone at around 5.30pm on Saturday prompting Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team to mount an emergency response. The 'horrendous' conditions, including 80mph winds and heavy snow, almost prevented the 17-person strong crew from reaching her in the boulder field of Coire an t-Sneachda. The team eventually found the woman, who was suffering from exhaustion and mild hypothermia, and carried her by stretcher for about a mile before putting her on a track vehicle, which took her back to base. This is the moment a climber is saved from a brutal -2C blizzard in the Scottish Highlands by mountain team in a daring rescue Emergency responders stretchered a female climber to safety after she became seperated from a group almost 4000 feet up in the Cairngorm mountains She had raised the alarm by her mobile phone at around 5.30pm on Saturday prompting Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team to mount an emergency response Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team leader Iain Cornfoot said: 'She was very cold and suffering from exhaustion. The conditions she had encountered were horrendous. 'In fact they were so bad - 80mph winds and heavy snow - we would not have gone out at that time. It was just too dangerous. She was lucky the conditions improved. 'Fortunately the wind dropped and that allowed us to reach her. It was just as well because I don't think she would have survived the night. 'She had become separated from the other two members of her party. 'They had finished their climb but then got separated in the terrible conditions at about 1200 metres (3937 feet). 'She was unable to walk due to exhaustion after being battered by the wind and encountering the heavy snow, but she raised the alarm. 'She was suffering from mild hypothermia when we found her. We then had to carry her by stretcher about a mile to one of our track vehicles. 'She needed some rewarming and we packaged her into our stretcher using blizzard blankets and heat pads and carried her out to our vehicle that was waiting in Coire Cas.' The team found the woman, who was suffering from exhaustion and mild hypothermia, and carried her by stretcher for about a mile They then put the woman on a track vehicle, which took her back to base. The operation was completed at 10.30pm and the woman needed no further medical treatment The operation was completed at 10:30pm and the woman needed no further medical treatment. Mr Cornfoot added: 'The winds in Cairngorm are usually the strongest in Britain and they can catch people out by their suddenness and ferocity. 'Other climbers managed to complete their climbs in the morning before the conditions deteriorated, unfortunately this party were not so fortunate.'",
