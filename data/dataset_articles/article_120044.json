  "text": "This is the moment a hiker was saved by mountain rescue heroes after becoming stuck in the [Highlands ](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/highland-council)during a terrifying [blizzard](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bad-weather). The woman had been climbing Coire an Sneachda, Grampians, when she separated from her group on Saturday, December 30. The alarm was raised at 5.30pm before [Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/two-hikers-caught-scots-avalanche-31617478) scrambled to the 1176m-high peak to save the stricken climber. Dramatic video footage shows the crew locating the woman in white-out conditions in a boulder field area of the mountain. She can then be seen carried to safety via a stretcher as teams battle against the subzero conditions. While the hiker was left uninjured, she was found very cold and suffering from exhaustion. After aiding her with heat pads and blankets, Mountain Rescue teams eventually reached ground level at 10.30pm. A statement from Cairngorm Mountain Rescue reads:\" Full team call out last night at 5.30pm for a climber who had become separated from their party. The climber was located in the boulder field of Coire an Sneachda very cold and suffering from exhaustion. \"Unable to walk due to exhaustion, after some rewarming we packaged the climber into our stretcher using blizzard blankets and heat pads and carried them out to our Can-Am that was waiting in Coire Cas. \"Everyone safe and back at base at 10.30pm.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter [here.](https://data.reachplc.com/230173593765361)",
