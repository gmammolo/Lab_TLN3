  "text": "Danielle Braff | Chicago Tribune\nPerhaps you love the concept of a cozy winter wonderland — the snow, the hot chocolate, the fireplace, the fluffy blankets — but you’re not so wild about treading through the actual snow, and bracing the frigid temperatures to get to the good stuff. You’re more of an après-ski type of a person than a skier. There’s no shame in that.\nWe’ve got a few suggestions for spots to try this winter if you want all that cozy goodness sans the chill.\nFairmont Scottsdale Princess in Arizona\nIce skating is always more fun when your toes don’t go numb from the cold. Experience this at\nFairmont Scottsdale Princess, where 6 million sparkling lights pave the way to their own version of a winter wonderland: a 6,000-square-foot outdoor rink in Arizona with real ice (this is a true Christmas miracle), a Ferris wheel, fire pits, s’mores, igloos and even an ice lounge. Yes, the ice lounge is actually cold, but they provide you with faux fur parkas, hot craft cocktails and the chance to take the perfect holiday selfie before returning to the heat.\nGreat Wolf Lodge in Gurnee\nWhen the weather outside is frightful, it’s time to celebrate the season at\nGreat Wolf Lodge, a chain of indoor water parks. For those who want to stay local, we love arriving at the Gurnee location clad in just our bathing suits and dashing into the lobby, where the real snow gives way to fake snowflakes, a gigantic fireplace and Spiked Sleigh Ride Sippers (vodka, pineapple juice, orange juice, watermelon purée and club soda). They bring the outdoors in with daily snow showers and a visit from Santa. Because the hotel rooms, the restaurants, the dry activities (everything from arcades to an immersive Harry Potter-like game) are indoors, there’s no reason to put on a coat until it’s time to leave.\nCoeur d’Alene Resort in Idaho\nSure, you could head to\nthis golfing resort in the summer during peak season. But we’d forgo that to witness the million-plus lights illuminate Idaho’s slushy Lake Coeur d’Arlene. Dine outdoors in heated igloos; take a festive lake cruise to visit Santa and his elves; and view the indoor Travolta Christmas show, hosted by Ellen Travolta, John’s older sister.\nTwin Farms in Vermont\nIf you want to feel like royalty for a few days, this is the place to be. At the\n18th century farmhouse formerly owned by Sinclair Lewis, a Nobel Prize-winning author, there are various accommodations that are all adults-only perfection. There are cottages, a lodge and the aforementioned farmhouse that come complete with food and drinks in the dining room or ordered directly to bed by dialing 125 (also dial this number if you need someone to top off your fireplace, to add more blankets to your bed or to draw you a bath). Emerge from your room only to take a pasta-making class (and eat it, obviously) or to take a dip into the 104-degree water inside the cedar bathhouse within the woods.\nThe Ranch at Rock Creek in Montana\nSink into the luxurious high-end duvets inside a rustic 19th century barn in Philipsburg, Montana. It’s all about the massive tub, the layered textures, the king-size bed topped with blankets and the upholstered furniture. Or stay in a private home or cabin — or inside the lodge, complete with a spa, fireplaces and Jacuzzi. They offer an all-exclusive experience here, so you never need to leave\nthe ranch for food, entertainment or anything you could want during your stay. Stay cozy with an outdoor hot tub or in the spa’s cedar sauna. Even if you skip the horseback riding excursion, you can book a Saddle Sore Soak at the spa, where you’ll be surrounded by candles while you soak in minerals from Montana’s geothermal springs.\nFrench Quarter Inn in South Carolina\nThis year, winter like a southern socialite in Charleston at the\nFrench Quarter Inn. In South Carolina, where the average high temperature in December is 61, relax in the Sleigh Bell Suite, where there’s ample mistletoe, garland, freshly baked cookies and bourbon-spiced eggnog. Oh, and a fireplace. Step into the lobby, which has a 15-foot tree and complimentary gingerbread cookies and hot chocolate. And while you’re in Charleston, view their traditional Holiday Boat Parade, tour Charleston’s holiday homes and take a holiday sleigh ride through downtown, no hats and scarves necessary.\nMohonk Mountain House in New York\nLegend has it that Stephen King’s “The Shining” was inspired by his many stays at\nthis resort, but Mohonk denies credit for this esteemed attribution. Nevertheless, envision an imposing Victorian castle lurching out of the snow in the Hudson Valley, nestled in the forest. If this sounds more cozy than terrifying to you, book this resort to experience the height of isolated perfection. Three gourmet meals are included with your stay; the indoor pool has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking that snowy forest and frozen lake; and the entire home feels like a warm cup of tea during the winter months. There’s a gingerbread competition, plenty of Christmas trees, lots of fireplaces, afternoon teas, lobby “Nutcracker” performances and more.\nStein Eriksen Lodge in Utah\nPerhaps your family is torn: Some want to ski while others want to après and nothing else. This is where you need to go. While the World Ski Awards voted\nStein Eriksen Lodge in Park City as the United States’ best ski hotel in 2023, we like to come here sans ski tickets. All rooms come with plush robes, slippers, a hot tub and a fireplace. There are three on-site restaurants, a fantastic spa and a lounge that serves cheese fondue and mulled wine.\nLake Placid Lodge in New York\nHead to the Adirondacks and step inside your cabin (or suite or guest room).\nThe lodge’s theme is rustic chic, and there are stone fireplaces, wooden beds and frozen lake views. It’s all about hunkering down: Meals are steps from your room (no need to pack a coat); there’s a wood-paneled pub complete with local beers and billiard tables; and you can wander through the lodge’s Olympic Center and Museum. The area was host to the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics.\nDunton Hot Springs in Colorado\nThey had us at “hot springs,” but there’s so much more to this Colorado Rockies\nghost town resort. Situated in a former mining town in southwest Colorado, across from Telluride, guests stay in authentic hand-built restored log cabins. Our favorite is the Well House cabin because it has a private hot spring and cold plunge — and it’s pet friendly! But other cabins have wood-burning fireplaces, and they all include meals and drinks. Spend your holiday in the Dunton Hot Springs’ restored 19th century bathhouse, which ranges from 85 to 106 degrees. Emerge to sit by the fire and play board games, drink hot cocoa and take a long nap.\nDanielle Braff is a freelancer.",
