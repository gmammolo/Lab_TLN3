  "text": "Global warming leading to weather anomalies, droughts, floods, melting glaciers, various forms of pollution and endangered biodiversity: while environmental news often brings its share of bad news, a glance in the rear-view mirror still offers something to rejoice in over the past twelve months.\nRhinos and saiga antelopes are back on their feet Poached for their horns, highly sought after in Asia for their purported aphrodisiac properties, rhinos are gradually regaining their shape. According to figures published by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in September, their global population is growing slightly, reaching 23,290 individuals, 5.2% more than in 2021.\nThanks to various conservation initiatives, the number of black rhinos in Africa is increasing; In white rhinos, there is also an increase: a first since 2012! Also poached for their meat but also for their horns, the saiga antelopes, of which more than half of the world's population was decimated a decade ago by disease, are also in better shape.\nRecognizable by their twisted horns and long, rounded snout, like a small trunk, the saigas have come close to extinction several times. Wikimedia Commons/Navinder Singh\nThere were more than 2 million in the 1950s and only 50,000 in the 2000s and even only 750 for the Saiga tatarica mongolica subspecies. Again, conservation measures have allowed this antelope to move from Critically Endangered to Near Threatened status by the IUCN.\nDownfishing For the first time in 2023, the percentage of overfished fish stocks in the Mediterranean and Black Seas fell below 60%, down 15% from the previous year. Overfishing is still causing damage and \"remains twice the level considered sustainable\" according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), but the effect of management plans and quotas is increasingly being felt, with overfishing pressure falling by a third since 2012.\nSome species that were once overfished are no longer overfished: this is the case for common sole in the Adriatic Sea, which has \"now reached sustainable exploitation rates\", and for turbot in the Black Sea, according to a report by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.\nThe development of aquaculture in marine waters, which has almost doubled in the last decade, is also playing a role in reducing the damage caused by over-harvesting.\nThe Amazon rainforest less devastated The re-election of President Lula as Brazil's president offers some respite to the Amazon rainforest. The latter caused deforestation operations to decline by nearly 33% in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period the previous year, according to data published by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research.\nVIDEO. Satellites, drones, AI... how Brazil is tracking illegal deforestation in the Amazon\n2023 is the year with the lowest deforestation rate since 2019. Lula does not intend to stop there, as he has promised to end illegal deforestation by 2030. During the tenure of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, logging in the Amazon increased by 60% compared to the previous four years. The Amazon rainforest stores about 100 billion tons of carbon each year.\nMoney to save corals After fifteen years of discussions and negotiations, the UN has finally adopted the first treaty to protect the high seas to preserve biodiversity in international waters. The member countries of this International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), of which France is a member, have pledged to raise $12 billion to protect corals from climate change, the effects of ocean pollution and overfishing.\nRead alsoSix feet under the sea: when our ashes save corals\nCoral reefs are directly threatened by global warming and quickly die by bleaching as soon as the temperature of the water in which they live rises by 1-2°Cfor only two consecutive weeks.\nThe other threat to corals is the increase in the acidity of ocean water, due to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nMarine snow, our best ally against CO2 Along with forests, the oceans sequester most of the carbon dioxide responsible for global warming. And they're even more effective than we thought. An international research team has discovered that \"sea snows\", the living microorganisms that look like miniature white flakes that bead from the surface of the sea to the abyss, ingest and feed on much more CO2 than scientists have calculated so far, 20% to be exact.\nBe careful, however, that this absorption process takes place over tens of thousands of years and is therefore \"not sufficient to counterbalance the exponential increase in CO2 emissions caused by global industrial activity since 1750\".\nFossil fuels now officially pointed out Despite numerous criticisms (organisation in an energy-intensive megalopolis in the middle of the desert, presidency held by the boss of an oil company, etc.), COP28, which ended in Dubai at the beginning of December, gave birth to two agreements considered \"historic\".\nThe first is to set up a global fund to finance what experts call \"loss and damage\" suffered by the most vulnerable countries, often the poorest, because of the effects of global warming, for which the richest nations are most responsible.\nA COP28 agreement calls for an acceleration of efforts to reduce electricity generation from coal, the most polluting fossil fuel (here the Garzweiler 2 mine in Germany). LP/Jean-Baptiste Quentin\nThe second, snatched from the very end of the climate conference, calls for a transition away from fossil fuels, pointing to oil, gas and coal by name. The text states that the world must \"transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a fair, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this crucial decade, in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050\".\nIn particular, it calls for the acceleration of efforts to phase down electricity generation from coal, the most polluting fossil fuel.\nGreenhouse gas emissions down in France According to figures from the Interprofessional Technical Centre for Air Pollution Studies (Citepa), France has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4.6% in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.\nThree sectors contributed the most to this decline: industry (-9.3%), energy production (-9.4%) and buildings (-7.5%). Transport contributed more modestly to this downward trend (-1.8%).\nUnfortunately, this effort is far from the one needed to meet the commitments made in 2015 with the Paris Agreement signed at the end of COP21. While a UN Climate report, published in mid-November, indicates that the global decline is only 2%, climate scientists recommend a drop of at least 43% to hope to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the strongest commitment of the Paris Agreement.",
