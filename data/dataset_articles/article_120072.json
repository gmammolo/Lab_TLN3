  "text": "CASPER, Wyo. — A chilly morning temperature of 21 degrees in Casper will double today as the final hours of 2023 tick away.\nThe National Weather Service in Riverton has forecast a high of 42 for the city under mostly sunny skies as a pattern of warm days continues.\n“Did you ever feel like you are trapped in a time warp? Across western and central Wyoming, with a few exceptions, it seems like the weather has been the same every day for the past week and a half or so. And this will continue for the most part for the next 5 days or so,” NWS in Riverton meteorologists wrote in the forecast discussion.\n“Much of the northern Rockies has been in a long wave ridge for much of December and this will continue into 2024. A couple of shortwaves will try to ride over the top of the ridge but this impacts again will be minimal, maybe some light snow showers over the west.\n“The only impacts, if you could call it that, would be some clouds from time to time. So it looks like more of the same, with mainly dry conditions,” they wrote. “Basins that have snow cover will remain cooler with temperatures near normal, like the Wind River and Green River Basins. Areas with little snow cover, like around Casper and Cody, will see above-normal temperatures pushing into the 40s at times. There will be some breezy conditions at times in the favored locations, like Casper. However, compared to what we can get this time of year, nothing we haven’t seen.”\nWhat that means for Casper is more of the same for days to come.\nThe New Year’s Day forecast calls for a high of 43. Skies will be partly sunny and become partly cloudy overnight as the low falls to around 21.\nTuesday through Thursday will see similar highs near 41 with sunny to mostly sunny skies. Overnight lows will drop to around 20 under partly cloudy skies.\nTemperatures will drop into the 30s, if the forecast holds up, on Friday and for the first weekend of 2024 as colder air approaches late in the week.\nMore on the forecast is available from the NWS in Riverton.",
