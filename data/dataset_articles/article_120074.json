  "text": "If you have any plans for the last day of 2023, the weather is looking fantastic!\nHigh pressure is building in today, which will bring us more sunshine through New Year’s Day. It will also reinforce the chilly air mass over us.\nIt’s a chilly start, with most back yeards dipping into the 40s, with some in southern communities still in the 50s. Other than a few clouds in the morning, Sunday will be a much sunnier day— yet cool. Highs will struggle to get out of the 60s.\nWith the clear sky and cooler conditions, the last sunset of the year should be fantastic! The sun goes down at 5:45 on Sunday. Shortly after it gets dark, you can expect it to get pretty chilly.\nYou’ll want to dress warm on NYE if you plan on heading to the Fort Myers ball drop or being outside to watch fireworks. Temperatures are forecast to fall below 50 after midnight. It will stay cold through the sunrise on Monday, with temperatures rebounding near 70 later in the day.\nYou won’t need the umbrella through much of the week. Our next rainmaker arrives Thursday and quickly moves out by Friday.\nHope you have a fun and safe end to the year!",
