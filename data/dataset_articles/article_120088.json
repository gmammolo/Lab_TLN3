  "text": "Hardy Brits braved the lashing rain and strong winds to usher in the New Year, as the nation came together to kick off 2024 in spectacular style. Revellers flocked to the banks of the River Thames in the early evening, hours ahead of the traditional London fireworks which lit up the sky into a cacophony of colours when Big Ben struck midnight. In a display that lasted almost 15 minutes, 100,000 people cast their eyes to the sky to take in the firework, laser, and drone spectacular which was hailed by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as the capital's 'best and biggest ever' New Year celebration. Another breathtaking display took place in Edinburgh as part of the annual Hogmanay celebrations, with fireworks launched above Edinburgh Castle while Kasabian's 'Fire' played out on the stroke of midnight. Partygoers refused to let the miserable weather dampen their parade as they powered through the pouring rain across the country, including in Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle, in a bid to welcome 2024 in style. While lucky ticket holders packed out the Thames to get the optimal view of the 12,000 fireworks fired above the London Eye, revellers dressed to the nines in their finest outfits have descended on clubs and bars to see in the New Year. Fireworks were launched into the sky above the London Eye as Britain saw in the new year New Year revellers get in the party spirit in Leeds overnight as they welcome in 2024 London put on a show tonight as a sensational firework display was witnessed by revellers braving the elements A wet start to the New Year in Manchester this morning as revellers hit the bars in rain ponchos LONDON: The display marked the King's coronation year and also used Charles' quote to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing Revellers welcome 2024 in Birmingham overnight as partygoers are carried through the street Hardy revellers have braved the lashing rain and strong winds to usher in 2024, as they shake off the dreary weather to kick off the New Year in spectacular style Revellers brave the rain as they make the most of New Year's Eve in Liverpool city centre LONDON: The capital was lit up by thousands of fireworks as crowds flocked to the River Thames LONDON: Fireworks explode around the London Eye and the Houses of Parliament during New Year's celebrations LONDON: Despite the miserable weather, revellers gathered on the banks of the Thames in the early evening, hours ahead of the traditional London fireworks which lit up the skies as Big Ben struck midnight LONDON: Fireworks explode around the London Eye and Big Ben as the clock struck midnight LONDON: The iconic fireworks were said to have soared as high as 200m into the air when they were launched from the London Eye on the stroke of midnight EDINBURGH: Fireworks light up the sky over Edinburgh Castle and the Balmoral Clock to mark the New Year Others dressed a little bit more suitably for the weather have flocked into city and town centres across the country to marvel at spectacular light and firework displays. That's despite a forecasters putting a storm warning in place which has caused some events in the south to be cancelled due to powerful 75mph gales. After millions watched the incredible displays in Sydney and Auckland, Mayor Sadiq Khan told Sky News that the events would be 'nothing' compared to London's - which lasted for just under 15 minutes. After the bongs of Big Ben sounded midnight, 'London: A Place for Everyone' was written high above the crowds as the unity-themed display welcomed the new year. As hits by the Spice Girls, Calvin Harris, Dua Lupa and others rang out across the city, revellers were invited to look back on 2023. The celebration referenced the King's coronation and also used Charles' quote to mark the 75th anniversary of the Windrush crossing in which he said the new arrivals 'collectively enrich the fabric of our national life'. The display - which included more than 12,000 fireworks, 600 drones and 430 lights - also paid homage to the NHS, which celebrated 75 years in 2023. There were repeated references to London's diversity and inclusivity, with the capital telling the world everyone is welcome in a city where people can be themselves. Further messages throughout the pyrotechnic show were heard from Mr Khan, Dame Helen Mirren, Bella Ramsey, Stephen Fry, Joanna Lumley, George the Poet, and Baroness Floella Benjamin, who read a poem by the late Benjamin Zephaniah. Mr Khan said: 'Our unique combination of fireworks, drones, lighting and music have put on a fabulous show for the millions watching around the globe, sending a message of unity and showing why London is the greatest city in the world. '2023 was filled with so many special moments, and as we move into 2024, I feel more inspired than ever to continue our work towards building a better, greener and more prosperous city for everyone.'

In Scotland, the 30th Hogmanay street party in Edinburgh was headlined by rock band Pulp after their surprise reunion last year. Edinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said: 'After the difficult years of the pandemic, I'm overjoyed that our festivals are back to their brilliant best and providing such high calibre cultural offerings for our residents and visitors.' Elsewhere, there has already been an impressive firework show in Blackpool, as the explosives erupted into the sky with Blackpool Tower illuminated in the background. In Newcastle's Quayside crowds were treated to BAFTA award-winning artist Seb Lee-Delisle's new Laser Light City laser show, which was projected onto the Baltic Flour Mills. Revellers also gathered in anticipation of Edinburgh's Hogmanay firework display as musicians hyped the crowd up for an evening of entertainment. Thousands of people are at the sold out Princes Garden Street Party and Concert in the Gardens in what mark's the festival's 30th anniversary. The event, organised by UniqueAssembly and City of Edinburgh Council, was headlined by Pulp, who have not played in the city in 20 years. Following their set, the fireworks will begin at midnight and will end at around 00.50am on Monday. Before the event, Alex MacDonald, 26, said he was most excited for Pulp and the fireworks. He told the PA news agency: 'I'm heavy looking forward to Pulp, like - it's gonna be smashing. 'The fireworks will be phenomenal man. It'll be brilliant. We'll have a heavy bevy to that, ken what I'm saying?' Dave Reed, also 26, said he is 'here for the tunes and everything else that's happening'. He added: 'I'm well excited for the fireworks, it's gonna be everything. 'That's what Edinburgh is all about, and that's what Hogmanay is all about.' Ahead of the main display, there were some small firework displays between different musical sets, much to the applause of the hyped-up crowd. Commenting on the news of a sell-out, Al Thomson, co-director of UniqueAssembly, said: 'We're in for one hell of a party now. Fifty thousand people in the streets of Edinburgh enjoying good music, good company, and one of the best fireworks displays in the world - there's no better way to start the new year. 'We started things off right with the Torchlight Procession on Friday, where we saw 20,000 people come together to shine a light on homelessness, raising money for our charity partner Social Bite; and this is just the perfect end to the year and the best way to celebrate 30 years of Edinburgh's Hogmanay.' However, not every planned event took place this evening, with Plymouth's Winter Wonderland and a Devon town's fireworks display both cancelled. A yellow weather warning for wind is in place for Britain's entire southern coastline and south Wales.

Saturday's Eurostar cancellations hit one family who were hoping to make it back to Britain in time for New Years, after they were stranded in Brussels following a surprise trip for a Canadian relative. Luke Gibbs, 32, from Kenley, south London, travelled with his wife, Kyla, cousin Liam Eton and sister-in-law Brea Melanson, from Canada, and planned to arrive in London in time for New Year's Eve celebrations on Sunday. Mr Gibbs, a business development manager, paid £600 for a New Year's Eve event in London Bridge, which is not refundable and now he cannot attend after his train from Brussels to St Pancras was cancelled. He described the communication with Eurostar as 'appalling'. 'I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say 'this is how you rebook it, we'll help you out with expenses',' Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency. 'They just said, 'unfortunately, it's cancelled, we're sorry, get on with it', which is shocking really.' Organisers of Plymouth's Winter Wonderland took the 'very difficult decision' to rip up its plans for New Year's Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds. 'As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can't possibly take the risk,' they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded. Elsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the 'horrendous' weather, reported Devon Live. Barnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.

'We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can't control the weather.' Temperatures are set to plummet on New Year's Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many. Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: 'There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January. 'The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high. 'The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.'",
