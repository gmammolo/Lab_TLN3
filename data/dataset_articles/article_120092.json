  "text": "Hardy Brits have braved the lashing rain and strong winds to head out for a night on the town to welcome the new year in style.\nRevellers, some dressed to the nines in their finest outfits, were seen on the streets of Newcastle and Liverpool powering through the pouring rain in a bid to make the most of New Year’s Eve celebrations.\nOthers dressed little bit more suitably for the weather have flocked into city and town centres across the country to marvel at spectacular light and firework displays.\nThat’s despite a forecasters putting a storm warning in place which has caused some events in the south to be cancelled due to powerful 75mph gales.\nIn true British fashion, large parts of the country are set to welcome 2024 in with a deluge of rain, but many who are out and about to celebrate the occasion will do their best not to let it dampen their spirits.\nNEWCASTLE: A reveller covers her head from the rain with a piece of fabric as she heads out into

London fireworks set to soar as high as 200m into the air when they are launched from the London Eye on the stroke of midnight.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said tickets for the event were sold out, adding: ‘If you didn’t manage to get tickets to attend, the capital is packed with plenty more exciting New Year’s Eve events.’\nIn Scotland, the 30th Hogmanay street party in Edinburgh will be headlined by rock band Pulp after their surprise reunion last year.\nEdinburgh City Council leader Cammy Day said: ‘After the difficult years of the pandemic, I’m overjoyed that our festivals are back to their brilliant best and providing such high calibre cultural offerings for our residents and visitors.’\nElsewhere, there has already been an impressive firework show in Blackpool, as the explosives erupted into the sky with Blackpool Tower illuminated in the background.\nIn Newcastle’s Quayside crowds were treated to BAFTA award-winning artist Seb Lee-Delisle’s new Laser Light City laser show, which was projected onto the Baltic Flour Mills.\nHowever, not every planned event will take place this evening, with Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland and a Devon town’s fireworks display both cancelled.\nA yellow weather warning for wind is in place for Britain’s entire southern coastline and south Wales.\nNEWCASTLE: Revellers brave the rain as they head for a night on the town in

surprise trip for a Canadian relative.\nLuke Gibbs, 32, from Kenley, south London, travelled with his wife, Kyla, cousin Liam Eton and sister-in-law Brea Melanson, from Canada, and planned to arrive in London in time for New Year’s Eve celebrations on Sunday.\nMr Gibbs, a business development manager, paid £600 for a New Year’s Eve event in London Bridge, which is not refundable and now he cannot attend after his train from Brussels to St Pancras was cancelled. He described the communication with Eurostar as ‘appalling’.\n‘I think the way (Eurostar) dealt with it is pretty appalling in terms of not trying to say ‘this is how you rebook it, we’ll help you out with expenses’,’ Mr Gibbs told the PA news agency.\n‘They just said, ‘unfortunately, it’s cancelled, we’re sorry, get on with it’, which is shocking really.’\nOrganisers of Plymouth’s Winter Wonderland took the ‘very difficult decision’ to rip up its plans for New Year’s Eve tonight because of the expected stormy winds.\n‘As much as we are very disappointed and frustrated, your safety comes first, as well as ours, and we can’t possibly take the risk,’ they said as they confirmed those who had bought tickets will be fully refunded.\nElsewhere, Barnstaple, in Devon, cancelled its annual fireworks because of the ‘horrendous’ weather, reported Devon Live.\nBarnstaple Town Centre Management said it axed the display for safety reasons.\nThey said: ‘Unfortunately due to the weather conditions and the gusting winds we will be unable to do the fireworks this evening due to safety.\n‘We know this is disappointing, but safety is always the priority and we unfortunately can’t control the weather.’\nTemperatures are set to plummet on New Year’s Day and in January increasing the chance of sleet and snow on higher grounds in the north, with frosty mornings for many.\nWeather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: ‘There are growing signs of cold weather developing as we head through the first half of January.\n‘The chance of a significant cold spell is quite high.\n‘The highest risk of snow will probably be in the North and East. But if low pressure pushes up from the southwest, this would lead to the possibility of snow as weather fronts move northeast.’",
