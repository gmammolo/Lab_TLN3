  "text": "The old year, 2023, seemed to put in a good word for itself in Washington on Sunday in its last chance to demonstrate its meteorological assets and abilities. It seemed to make use of ingredients generally available in late December to produce a day that both fell within plausible temperature parameters and demonstrated the radiant glories available in winter. Sunday’s high of 51 degrees was one degree higher than Saturday’s high of 50. It was also five degrees above average for Dec. 31 in the District of Columbia. Broad expanses of blue sky made room for peaceful solar coexistence with a profusion of clouds, but however many the daytime clouds were, none seemed to suggest the dark surliness of winter gloom. Sometimes they seemed to be feathery white structures that, in their attenuated appearance, highlighted their deep blue surroundings and hinted at a world of cold at high altitudes. Perhaps three miles up, where temperatures by atmospheric laws conceivably hovered in the zero-degree range, they resembled the expansion of frost crystals on a cold window pane. On the streets, in the sunshine, Sunday seemed another pleasantly mild December day. It was one more 50-degree day in a month that has seen many such days. It seemed pleasant even if Sunday was, of all December days, celebrated for its position as the most January-adjacent.",
