  "text": "On Christmas Day, the weather is friendly and sunny in the west and south and there are often only high clouds in the sky; any early fog will soon dissipate. In the north, and partly also in the east, there are still some denser cloud fields, but short showers remain the exception here too. The maximum temperatures range from six to 16 degrees.\nSt. Stephen’s Day Overall, the weather is pleasant with a few hours of sunshine, but in between there are also a few clouds in the sky, mostly in high and medium-high layers. There are generally slightly more clouds in the south and southeast; in the basin areas there is sometimes thick fog or high fog. The wind blows weak to moderately, sometimes briskly from westerly directions in the north and east. Early temperatures depending on the wind minus four to plus eight degrees, maximum temperatures four to 13 degrees.\nAustria remains midweek in a mild westerly current. With this, there will be an interplay of a few denser clouds and sunshine in most parts of the country until the evening. There may also initially be a few patches of fog in the south and southeast. The wind comes from the southeast to the west and blows weakly to moderately with early temperatures between minus four and plus nine degrees, the higher values are measured in the east. Five to twelve degrees are the maximum.\nLocated in the flatlands of the east, in the Danube valley, on the eastern edge of the Alps and in inner Alpine basins and valleys on Thursday For a few hours there will be thick fog or high fog. However, after a partially hesitant resolution, the sun shines temporarily. However, a few denser clouds will temporarily move through from the west during the day. Despite everything, the probability of rain or showers remains low. The wind usually only blows lightly. In the foehn valleys in the north or when dense clouds pass through, the south to west wind temporarily picks up somewhat. It’s minus five to plus two degrees in the morning, and four to twelve degrees are possible during the day.\nStarts in inner Alpine basins and valleys, but especially in the parts of the country south of the main Alpine ridge Friday with fog or high fog of varying persistence. Apart from that, sunshine usually predominates and only thin, high clouds adorn the sky. A few denser clouds are only passing through in the north and east. But here too, the probability of rain and showers remains low. The wind comes from the southeast to the west and is usually light. In parts of Upper and Lower Austria as well as in Vienna, however, the westerly wind blows sometimes briskly. After minus six to plus eight degrees in the morning, it ends up being four to 13 degrees during the day.\ninfo By clicking on the icon you can add the keyword to your topics.\ninfo\nBy clicking on the icon you open your “my topics” page.
