  "text": "Updated: 11 hours ago| Happy New Year! If you’re heading out to celebrate tonight, the weather will be quiet and chilly. Temperatures will be dropping into the low and mid 40s by the sunrise. There is a chance for some patchy, dense fog overnight and in the morning. We’ll be a little warmer on New Year’s Day with highs in the mid 60s. A quick moving front will bring a few hit or miss showers around midday, but it looks like any rain will be light. Most of us will not see any rain, but we do expect more cloud cover. That front will drop temps to near freezing waking up on Tuesday morning. We will stay cool Tuesday afternoon with highs in only the mid to upper 50s. Updated: 21 hours ago| Happy New Year’s Eve! It will be dry today and just a bit warmer. High temperatures will be in the low 60s, and we’ll see a mostly sunny sky. If you’re going to be celebrating later tonight, the weather will be quiet. Temperatures around midnight will be in the upper 40s. Eventually we’ll drop into the mid 40s by the sunrise. You may run into some patchy fog in the morning. Updated: Dec. 30, 2023 at 10:44 PM CST| Eric's First Alert Forecast Dec 30, 2023 Updated: Dec. 30, 2023 at 6:40 PM CST| Eric's First Alert Forecast Dec 30, 2023 Updated: Dec. 30, 2023 at 6:30 AM CST| It has been frosty this morning, but we’re going to see tons of sunshine today!
