  "text": "The new year starts feeling very much like winter! Monday will be cloudy and cold with highs in the upper 30s. Watch for flurries in the morning and flurries/sprinkles later in the afternoon with just a little lingering moisture. After a mostly cloudy and cold night with lows in the mid to upper 20s, Tuesday looks a little better with near normal highs in the 40s and sunshine returning. A southern low will throw more cloud cover our way midweek with a few rain/snow showers possible Wednesday night, especially down south.
