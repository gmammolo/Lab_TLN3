  "text": "4Warn Weather – Happy New Year! We are starting off 2024, and a new work week, pretty close to average. As temperatures drop below freezing this morning in our suburbs, any damp roads or sidewalks could turn into a few slick spots. Today’s sunrise is at 8:02 a.m. Clouds will hang tight on this Monday. Temperatures will top out in the seasonal mid-30s -- however, a northerly breeze will keep wind chill readings in the 20s throughout the day. Tonight’s sunset is at 5:12 p.m. Winds will shift tonight as skies clear. Lows will be in the upper 20s. Mild week with flurry chance As winds pick up out of the south-southwest on Tuesday, temperatures will rise into the upper 30s, close to 40 degrees, under mostly sunny skies. Wind gusts Tuesday will likely peak around 20-25 mph. Otherwise, we’ll have a pretty calm start to the new year. There’s a low-end chance for flurries on Wednesday due to an advancing cold front. That will usher in a cooler air mass on Thursday, bringing highs in the low 30s paired with some more sunshine. Elsewhere ... Nationally, a light wintry mix will impact parts of the mid-Atlantic, and some accumulating snowfall is expected across the Appalachians. Remember to download the free 4Warn weather app -- it’s easily one of the best in the nation. Just search your app store under WDIV and it’s right there available for both iPhones and Androids!
