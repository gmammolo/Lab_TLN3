  "text": "Quiet Start to 2024\nHappy New Year! We are welcoming 2024 with some quiet weather in Sothern New England. Today will be dry with a blend of sun and clouds and seasonable temperatures topping out in the lower-40s. Cold air moves on in overnight tonight with mainly clear skies. We are expecting to drop into the lower-20s by Tuesday morning. Tuesday and Wednesday are looking mainly sunny, seasonable and dry with temps topping out 40-45. Our next chance of rain is on Thursday. A cold front brings a 40% chance of rain developing in the morning. and through Thursday evening. Temperatures drop for Friday with highs in the 30s and sunshine returns. Saturday is the winner of the weekend with mostly sunny skies and highs un the upper-30s. All eyes are on Sunday as models are indicating the development of a coastal storm that could bring snow and wind to Southern New England. As with all coastal storms, the track will be the key to who gets what and how much. Given that we are the better part of a week away, this forecast will be refined through the coming days. Stay tuned…",
