  "text": "TYLER, Texas — This blast of cold weather has all of us bundling up with our homeless neighbors turning to local shelters for a place to stay warm. Some shelters across East Texas are already reaching their capacity. Last year the [Salvation Army](https://www.facebook.com/SalvationArmyTyler/) in Tyler had about 40,000 people seek shelter and are expecting for that number to exceed this year. Case Management Supervisor, Indus Mcduff, said they’re currently seeing about 120 people per day. The facility currently has 200 beds. \"Once the temps are below 40 degrees, we allow people who may normally not be able to stay in a shelter, we do allow them to come in out of the cold and sleep,\" Mcduff said. It’s the same scenario in Longview at the Hiway 80 Rescue Mission Center. They’re reaching capacity every night with over a hundred people using their beds; while feeding close to 400 people a day. \"We have had to increase our capacity in inclement weather. And that kind of puts a strain on resources a little bit,\" case manager at Hiway 80, Juan Davis said. Davis said the biggest contributor to the influx of people is inflation. \"Price of housing has went up 26% In the last year, and there are over 2000 homes that are sitting empty because people can't afford to live in them,\" Davis said. Both shelters say donations from the public really go a long way, especially during the holidays. \"A lot of people are struggling themselves and for them to take from what little they have to give to us is very much appreciate it,\" Mcduff said. Donations for food and winter items are still greatly needed as they expect the demand to increase.",
