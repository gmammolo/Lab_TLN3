  "text": "\"Texas is back\" has been uttered more than a few times over the last decade, but only now do the Longhorns truly appear to be back.\nWith a College Football Playoff berth in hand after a one-loss season to finish off its Big 12 tenure, Texas sits two wins away from a national championship and boasts one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Quinn Ewers.\nBefore Texas completed the ultimate turnaround, however, coach Steve Sarkisian had to turn his own life around. Alcoholism once left Sarkisian's coaching future uncertain, but he's found a home as leader of a Longhorns program that has a chance to re-emerge as a perennial title contender.\nMORE:\nFirst look at Texas' 2024 schedule as SEC tenure begins\nHere's what you need to know about how Sarkisian overcame alcoholism, as well as how he credits his success at Texas to his long journey to sobriety.\nSteve Sarkisian's battle with alcoholism\nLike many public figures, not all of Sarkisian's battle played out privately. He took an indefinite leave of absence while serving as USC's head coach in 2015 after showing up to a pre-practice meeting intoxicated, and the school fired him the following day.\nOther incidents were subsequently reported, with\nESPN reporting Sarkisian's assistants believed he was intoxicated during a game against Arizona State two weeks before his firing. The Los Angeles Times also detailed a handful of alcohol-fueled incidents involving Sarkisian during his time at Washington.\nSarkisian's alcoholism battle was a years-long struggle, but hitting rock bottom at USC helped finally push him to get to the help he needed and stay sober.\nSarkisian told CBS Sports in 2017 that then-Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia's decision to take himself off the postseason roster and enter a rehab facility for alcoholism in 2015 inspired him to seek help. Even after rehab, Sarkisian continued to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\nA little help from Nick Saban also helped keep Sarkisian on the right path. Saban gave Sarkisian a chance early in the 2016 season when he hired the former USC coach as an offensive analyst. Sarkisian replaced Lane Kiffin as the program's offensive coordinator at the end of the season, but that stint was brief. By February 2017, Sarkisian was hired by the Atlanta Falcons as their offensive coordinator.\nSaban still kept Sarkisian in mind and re-hired him as Alabama's offensive coordinator in 2019, giving Sarkisian a chance to coach Tua Tagovailoa, DeVonta Smith, Mac Jones and a slew of other NFL talents over the next two seasons. Sarkisian's success in Tuscaloosa, along with his continued commitment to sobriety, ultimately led to his opportunity to become the head coach at Texas ahead of the 2021 season.\nSarkisian also credits Saban with saving his life. Alabama administers a comprehensive physical exam for its coaching staff before every season, and that exam turned up a heart condition for Sarkisian that required emergency surgery in 2020.\nSarkisian has completely recovered, but had the issue not been detected, he was \"potentially days and certainly weeks away from suffering a life-ending heart aneurysm,\"\naccording to Yahoo Sports.\nMORE:\nSN's College Football Playoff predictions\nSarkisian enjoyed a full-circle moment when Texas went into Tuscaloosa and upset Alabama in September. Without that win, the Longhorns wouldn't be in the playoff and potentially staring down a rematch with the Tide in the championship game.\nTo get there, though, Sarkisian must defeat one of the teams he coached while he was still fighting to overcome alcoholism. Texas will face Washington in the Sugar Bowl for a chance to play for a championship, and a victory would take a resilient Sarkisian one step closer to the pinnacle of college football.\nWhen did Steve Sarkisian become sober?\nSarkisian has been sober since he entered rehab after his firing at USC in 2015. He thinks about how his stint with the Trojans unceremoniously ended \"every morning when he wakes up,\" according to Yahoo Sports, and Sarkisian has used that moment to keep himself on the right path ever since.\n\"I think it really shaped me, quite frankly,\"\nSarkisian said in a 2021 radio interview describing the adversity he went through.\" Sarkisian added that his \"perseverance to fight through\" his battle with alcoholism has helped him better connect with the everyday struggles his players experience.\nNow eight years sober, the mere fact Sarkisian is standing on the sideline as a College Football Playoff head coach could serve as inspiration to anyone going through what the the 49-year-old coach experienced.",
