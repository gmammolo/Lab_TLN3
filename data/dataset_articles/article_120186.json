  "text": "After a cold and foggy start to the morning, we’re on track to see a bright and beautiful day to kick off the new year. Temperatures will warm up quickly through the morning, with daytime highs landing at 70 degrees this afternoon. The low humidity and sunshine will make for a picture-perfect day if you have any New Year’s Day outdoor plans. If you’re taking the boat out, the wind won’t be much of a factor. Seas will run between 1-2 feet, and inland waters will stay smooth. Expect another night of chilly weather tonight, but it won’t be as cold as the last couple of nights. We’ll wake up Tuesday morning to temperatures in the mid-50s for most of Southwest Florida. We’ll see lots of ups and downs in our temperatures this week, thanks to three cold fronts moving through our area. The first front moves through Tuesday, bringing us a reinforcing shot of cool air but not much rain. The second front moves through Thursday, and the third cold front moves through this weekend. The weekend front will provide us with our best rain chances this week, and we’ll also see some rather windy weather to start the first weekend of 2024.",
