  "text": "Happy New Year! Widespread fog and low-lying clouds will roll into town New Year’s Eve, lasting on-and-off through New Year’s Day and the beginning of 2024.\nA Dense Fog Advisory is in place across most of central and eastern WA until noon on New Year's Day. Visibility could be as low as one quarter mile or less on the roads, so drive carefully!\nLow overnight temperatures Sunday into Monday will be in the low-30s for Spokane and Coeur d’Alene, while slightly cooler for areas across the northeast mountains. This means freezing fog is expected at times early Monday morning. Daytime highs will rise to the high-30s and low-40s across the region on New Year’s Day!\nThe beginning of our first week of 2024 will remain mostly dry, until a weak weather disturbance will bring a chance for light precipitation in the east slopes of the Cascades Tuesday into Wednesday. Then, a cooling trend is on the way – bringing the chance of a rain and snow mix to Spokane and the valleys by Friday, with snow expected regionwide by the weekend.",
