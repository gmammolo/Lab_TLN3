[According to the Anchorage Daily News, ](https://www.adn.com/alaska-life/2023/12/25/snowzilla-returns-to-airport-heights-after-10-year-hiatus/)the snowman dubbed \"Snowzilla\" was the subject of a cease-and-desist letter from the city as neighbors complained the snowman increased traffic in the neighborhood.
