  "text": "We are looking at a gorgeous day to start 2024 across southern Colorado and around Colorado Springs.\n\"Today's nice weather will include mostly sunny skies, light winds and mild temperatures,\" Gazette media partner Alan Rose with KOAA said. \"Afternoon highs will top out in the 30s and 40s in the mountains and mountain valleys, with 40s and lower 50s for the Plains.\"\nAround Colorado Springs the high today will be around 51 degrees with clouds increasing this evening as part of a weaker storm moving south of Colorado on Tuesday.\nLooking ahead:\n\"A weak storm moving to our south on Tuesday will bring us a cooler and cloudier day, with our high back down to the mid 40s,\" Rose said. \"After a few degrees of warming on Wednesday, our late week forecast is now trending colder and snowier this morning.\"\nRose said a storm system currently located more than 2,000 miles west of Colorado will move towards the southern Rockies late this week. Snow will be possible from Thursday afternoon into early Friday morning here in the Pikes Peak Region. Temperatures on Thursday will warm to near 40 degrees, with 30s on Friday.\nHere is the full forecast from the\nNational Weather Service:\nTuesday: Mostly sunny, with a high near 46. Northwest wind 5 to 10 mph becoming south southeast in the morning.\nWednesday: Sunny, with a high near 48. Northwest wind 5 to 10 mph becoming southeast in the morning.\nThursday: A 20% chance of snow showers after 11 a.m. Mostly cloudy, with a high near 42. West wind 5 to 10 mph becoming east in the morning.\nFriday: Partly sunny, with a high near 39. North wind around 15 mph.",
