  "text": "The\nweather conditions were perfect, the temperature just right and the national anthem, entrance costumes and crowd enthusiasm were all of the highest quality. The 2024 Discover NHL Winter Classic at T-Mobile Park, Seattle, on New Year’s Day was just the show you could have hoped for.\nOn the ice, the home team Seattle Kraken drew the longest straw when, via goals from Eeli Tolvanen, Will Borgen and Yanni Gourde, they were able to defeat the visiting Vegas Golden Knights 3-0.\nTolvanen, who has been one of the Kraken’s leading scorers this season, recorded his 10th goal of the season 4:50 into the first period when he tipped a Vince Dunn shot into the back of the net. Adam Larsson played over the puck along the blue line to Dunn, whereupon the defender lifted the puck towards the goal where Tolvanen was waiting. Golden Knights goaltender of the day, Logan Thompson, had no chance to react when the puck changed direction.\n2024-01-01 23:23:14\n#Daccord #nailed #Kraken #won #Winter #Classic #NHL.comen",
