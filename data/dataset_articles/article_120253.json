  "text": "PORTSMOUTH, Ohio (WCHS) — Today's weather did not put a damper on a two decades-old Portsmouth New Year's Day tradition. At noon about a couple dozen waded into the Ohio River and immediately waded out, all for a great cause. For more than 20 years, the polar plunge has been a fun yet crazy way to raise money. Organizers call it \"freezin' for a reason\". The event attracts young and old and childhood friends. Emily Stone has been taking part for six years Her two friends have been doing it for two years. \"It was just a simple text. We are doing this, and they said what time do we need to be there,\" said Stone. Perhaps the hardest part of the event is waiting, till the time comes to jump into the river, with people coming out as quickly as they jumped in. \"Invigorating. Feel alive,\" said Jason Snell. For the Snell family, the polar plunge has become a family tradition. \"We do it in celebration of all the lives that were saved through recovery this year and in memorial of all the lives that were lost,\" said Snell. \"I am immune to it. I don't know. I just am. I can handle it,\" said Ron Ferrell, a participant referring to the cold. John Simon, American Legion Post 23 Commander says his brother and his friends started the polar plunge more than 20 years ago. \"They decided it would be fun to go jump into the river on New Years Day to ring in the New Year. People started showing up, showing up,\" said Simon. A few years later it turned into a fundraiser. This year's money will go to local veterans in rest homes and for their Christmas, but for those taking the polar plunge it supplies them with memories that won't soon forgotten. \"The coldest it has ever been. It was fun though. Cold but fun,\" said Stone. Organizers say on average about 35 take the plunge every year, depending on how cold the weather is.",
