  "text": "Brits are set to flee the UK for sunny holidays abroad in 2024 (Image: Getty) Some 56% of adults say they plan to take an overseas summer holiday this year, a survey suggests – and 51% intend to travel abroad more than once in 2024.\nAround one in 13 expect to research and book their next holiday on the same day, according to the Savanta poll of 2,295 adults commissioned by financial protection scheme Atol.\nBut a fifth said the process will likely take them more than a month as they get stuck into planning the perfect break.\nSome will be spurred on by continuing winter storms with no let-up for the new year.\nAs Storm Henk became the latest to hit our shores, a taxi driver and passengers in a black Mercedes Vito minibus had to be rescued from a 3.5ft flood in Essex yesterday.\nTrending As thoughts turn to lazy summer days on the beach, the travel industry is braced for Sunshine Saturday this weekend, with a surge of bookings expected on the day.\nMany holiday companies traditionally offer discounts in this time of year, but Atol warned consumers to “read the small print”.\nAtol provides support for people who have booked a package trip – such as flights and accommodation – when a tour operator goes out of business. It arranges for people already overseas to be flown home and reimburses financial losses suffered by those with future trips.\nThe scheme, run by the Civil Aviation Authority, was launched 50 years ago.\nCAA director Tim Johnson said: “This weekend, typically known as Sunshine Saturday, is traditionally the busiest for people booking their holidays, with many travellers taking advantage of bargain deals.\n“We’ve seen bookings grow significantly back to pre-pandemic levels and that’s why it’s important to make smart decisions to avoid missing out on key financial protection.\n“By booking an Atol-protected holiday, consumers know they can then relax and won’t be left out of pocket should their travel firm collapse.”\nAtol’s tips to consumers include checking web addresses are legitimate, not replying to unsolicited emails, texts, social media messages or calls with holiday offers, using a credit card to pay – and always remembering to buy travel insurance.\nRelated articles New travel rules for British tourists in 2024 Brit complains her holiday to Benidorm was ruined by 'too many Spanish people' Heidi Klum soaks up the sun in romantic Caribbean geta Family of mother and son killed in horror Alps avalanche speaks out Simon Calder shares 4 beautiful and 'very affordable' destinations for 2024 Become an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial",
