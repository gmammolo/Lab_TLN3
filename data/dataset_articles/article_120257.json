  "text": "TULSA, Okla. (KTUL) — Temperatures are dropping, and the Tulsa Day Center is hard at work helping those without homes. They're now making outreach efforts to provide basic needs outside their walls. Mack Haltom with the Tulsa Day Center says the community can donate and volunteer. \"We've got a full house, we've had a full house now since the weather has turned cold,\" said Haltom. Haltom added that their shelter is at capacity. \"We're now doing outreach through the Tulsa Day Center. And it's a real need for our outreach team right now, specifically for a couple of things. Some blankets and sleeping bags would be nice,\" said Haltom. He says they hand those items out to people because there's not enough shelter space right now. \"Right now, we're in need of towels, underwear, still warm clothing as it gets, you know, cold weather is not going anywhere real soon,\" said Haltom. He says there are things that the community can do to help. \"Continue to support us financially and with their donations. And just be aware that there's a need out there and to help any way they can,\" said Haltom. He says that if the community wants to help, they can contact him at the Tulsa Day Center or Housing Solutions Tulsa. \"We depend on donations, for sure. We do have some federal grant dollars that help us keep our shelter going, as well as some city grant dollars. And foundations are very good to us as well,\" said Haltom. He says they're open 24/7, and they welcome volunteers. \"We always hope to have some help in the clothing room. Our clinic is in need of volunteers helping there as well,\" said Haltom. Haltom says there’s also an emergency plan for if there’s a freeze similar to the 2022 winter storm. He says if a big freeze like that were to happen, there are at least two churches that will help bring people in and Tulsa Day Center will have to expand their numbers in their base shelter and other shelters.
