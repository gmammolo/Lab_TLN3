  "text": "Australian James Duckworth has overcome a frustrating rain delay to continue his fine run from qualifying to reach the second round of the weather-marred Brisbane International.\nDuckworth upset higher-ranked American JJ Wolf 6-3 6-4 in a match initially scheduled for Monday morning but which didn't start until Tuesday afternoon.\nThe wild storms that hit south-east Queensland over the Christmas period have also caused chaos for tournament organisers who face a backlog of matches to get through this week.\nDuckworth did his best to help, taking just 63 minutes to see off the 53rd-ranked Wolf with a clean and efficient display featuring no service breaks, seven aces and 81 per cent of first-serve points won.\nThe world No.116's reward in reaching the last 16 is a tie against unseeded German Yannick Hanfmann, who surprised American fifth seed Sebastian Korda 7-5 6-4.\nFive other home hopes were scheduled for action on Tuesday, including two all-Australian showdowns between Thanasi Kokkinakis and Rinky Hijikata and Jordan Thompson against Aleksandar Vukic.\nIf the weather holds, Jason Kubler will take on Russia's 2021 Australian Open semi-finalist Aslan Karatsev, the tournament's eighth seed.\nThe great Rafael Nadal makes his much-anticipated comeback from almost a year out with a hip injury against Australia's former US Open champion Dominic Thiem in the feature men's night match on Tuesday.\n ",
