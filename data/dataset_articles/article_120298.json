  "text": "Sunshine to close out the week. HASTINGS, Neb. (KSNB) - Skies will gradually clear out overnight tonight, as the upper level storm that has impacted our Christmas holiday, continues to clear out. With the clearing skies morning temperatures will plummet into the teens and lower 20s. Sunshine will return the next couple of days with highs making a push for the lower 40s both Friday and Saturday. That will help melt some of the recent snow but Saturday afternoon another cold front sweeps through bringing clouds back into the region. Cold high pressure follows sending temperatures into the mid 20s Sunday afternoon with late night revelers facing lows Monday morning in the single digits. New Years Day will be mostly sunny but highs will remain in the upper 20s. The rest of next week will be back in the lower to middle 30s.
