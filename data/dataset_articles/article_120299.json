We need this peace because our intention for the state is not for our personal interest but that of the development of the state.”\nGunmen kidnap LG chair, others in Nasarawa\nAutomated Passport application process begins January 8 – Minister\nThe governor disclosed that his administration was determined to live a legacy of unity and development in Rivers State, and not a legacy of political apprehension.\nIn his welcome address, the Secretary to the State Government, Dr Tammy Wenike Danagogo, expressed gratitude to God that despite the political turbulence in the state, Governor Fubara was focused to dispense the dividends of democracy in the state.\nHe pointed out that Rivers State is blessed to have a governor that is “calculated, humble, honest and hardworking,” and urged Rivers people to be apostles of peace, truth and justice for the state to continue on a trajectory of greatness.",
