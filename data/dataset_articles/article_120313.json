  "text": "Protecting your home against potential dangers is paramount in the face of increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather events. From fierce storms and heavy rainfall to scorching heat waves, understanding how to fortify your home can help you prepare for severe weather events and contribute to a more sustainable and energy-efficient living environment. How to Prepare for Severe Weather Severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and blizzards, can strike unexpectedly, posing significant threats to life and property. Climate change is the driving force behind such events, further solidifying the importance of taking energy-saving measures to mitigate the climate crisis. Being prepared for such occurrences is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of yourself and your community. Here are some actionable steps you can take to prepare for severe weather and conserve energy. Insulation and Weather Stripping One of the most effective ways to protect your home from the impact of dangerous weather is to ensure it’s properly insulated. Adequate insulation helps regulate indoor temperatures, preventing unnecessary energy consumption to maintain a comfortable living space. Sealing gaps and cracks with weather stripping can further enhance insulation, keeping your home well-protected against the elements and reducing the strain on your heating and cooling systems. The average family can [reduce their heating and cooling costs by 15%](https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/methodology) just by sealing doors. Investing in high-quality insulation materials, such as fiberglass or foam board, can provide long-term benefits. Additionally, consider hiring a professional to assess your home’s insulation needs and make recommendations tailored to your specific climate and weather patterns for optimal benefits. Impact-Resistant Windows and Doors Installing impact-resistant windows and doors can provide additional protection during severe weather conditions such as hurricanes or strong winds. These specifically designed structures enhance the safety of your home and contribute to energy efficiency by preventing drafts and leaks. Some of these windows are so strong that a branch [falling at 100 miles per hour](https://wrightsimpactwindowanddoor.com/blog/reasons-to-install-impact-windows-doors/) can’t break the glass. The increased durability of impact-resistant materials can reduce the need for frequent repairs, ultimately conserving energy and resources. When choosing impact-resistant windows and doors, look for ones with high energy efficiency ratings. Some models come with multiple layers of glass and insulating gas fillings, offering improved thermal performance. While the initial investment may be higher, long-term energy savings and enhanced safety features make it worthwhile. Storm Shutters For areas prone to hurricanes or high winds, installing storm shutters can provide an extra layer of protection for windows. These shutters help prevent breakage and minimize the risk of debris entering your home during severe weather events. Additionally, they contribute to energy efficiency by reducing heat transfer and maintaining a stable indoor temperature. Roof Maintenance A well-maintained roof is crucial for protecting your home from the brunt of extreme weather. Regular inspections and repairs can prevent leaks, water damage, and structural issues that may arise during heavy rainfall or snowfall. Additionally, a light-colored roof [can help regulate indoor temperatures](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/cool-roofs#:~:text=This%20lowers%20the%20temperature%20of,(28%20%C2%B0C)%20cooler.) by reducing heat absorption, leading to lower energy consumption for cooling purposes. Schedule annual roof inspections to identify and address any potential issues promptly. Consider using cool roof coatings with [reflective properties to deflect sunlight](https://renovated.com/storm-resistant-roofing-material/) and reduce heat absorption. This coating also protects your home from weather-related damage and contributes to a more energy-efficient cooling system. Smart Landscaping Strategic landscaping can serve as a natural barrier against dangerous weather. Planting windbreaks, such as trees and shrubs, can [shield your home from strong winds](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/landscaping-windbreaks#:~:text=A%20windbreak%20reduces%20heating%20costs,and%20the%20skin%20temperature%20drops.), reducing the risk of structural damage. Furthermore, adding shade-providing vegetation around your property can assist in cooling your home, reducing the need for excessive air conditioning during hot weather. Choose native, drought-resistant plants for landscaping to create a low-maintenance and eco-friendly garden. These [indigenous plants require less water](https://www.asla.org/nativeplantssavemoney.aspx), conserving resources in the process. Position windbreaks strategically to maximize their protective effects. Properly designed landscaping helps you prepare for severe weather and contributes to your home’s overall energy efficiency. Why Should You Conserve Energy? It’s now more important than ever to conserve energy, given the escalating challenges climate change poses, environmental degradation and the finite nature of our natural resources. The average household is responsible for [14,020 pounds of CO2 emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/assumptions-and-references-household-carbon-footprint-calculator) each year, significantly contributing to climate change. Fossil fuels provide most of the world’s energy, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases contribute to climate change, leading to rising global temperatures, extreme weather events and ecosystem disruptions. Minimizing energy consumption can reduce your carbon footprint, slow climate change and protect the planet’s delicate balance. From an economic standpoint, households and businesses can save money by reducing their energy consumption. Optimizing heating and cooling and investing in energy-efficient appliances can minimize electricity use, reducing utility bills. Depending on your home improvements, households [can save up to 20%](https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/improvements/benefits/savings) on their electricity bill. It Starts at Home Protecting your home from dangerous weather plays a vital role in conserving energy and promoting sustainability. Implementing these measures protects your property and loved ones and contributes to a more resilient and energy-conscious home. As climate change continues to pose challenges, taking proactive steps to fortify your home becomes integral to creating a safer and more sustainable living space.",
