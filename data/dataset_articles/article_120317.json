  "text": "Cloudy skies, a windchill of –3 C and a water temperature of 2.6 C — perfect conditions to take a dip into Lake Ontario. If you are a polar bear that is. About 200 people of all ages jumped into the cold drink off [Bal Harbour Park](https://facilities.grimsby.ca/Home/Detail?CategoryIds=11218%2C11229&FacilityTypeIds=20447%2C20448&Keywords=&ScrollTo=google-map-trigger&CloseMap=true&Id=77f44db9-2aff-4d8b-a647-8711a4c30037) Jan. 1 in the 15th annual [Grimsby Polar Bear Dip](https://grimsbypolarbear.ca/). The event also attracted about 300 spectators. “It was damn cold,” said Malcolm Harris after emerging from the water. It was his first polar bear plunge. “It was exhilarating,” added Harris’s friend Joe Schweitzer, who also went into the frigid water for the first time. You might be interested in Most of the dippers ran in and out of the water while some stayed in for a few minutes. Swimmers began lining up to register for the 2 p.m. event an hour before splash time. Participants were asked to sign a waiver and organizers ran out of copies about 15 minutes before the dip began and people who didn’t sign the waiver were permitted to take part. Many brought along bundles of warm clothing to change into after emerging from the lake. Parking on the side streets near the beach area was almost impossible to find between 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. The event raised more than $8,700 for the [McNally House Hospice](https://www.mcnallyhousehospice.com/), $3,000 more than last year. Since it began, the dip has raised more than $43,000 for the hospice. “It’s a great way to start the year doing something that is very cold and not fun but the community support that comes out is awesome,” said Allie Zanuk, a former event organizer who took part in her ninth swim. Event organizer and polar bear Gavin Lutz said this year's dip included about 60 more people than last year, the most ever. “Grimsby supports their community and it’s a great way to start the year,” Lutz said. “We wash away the old year and we have some fun.”",
