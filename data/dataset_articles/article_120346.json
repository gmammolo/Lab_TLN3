  "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect for Ashe, Watauga, Avery, Caldwell, Burke, and Alexander counties until 1 p.m. Saturday. This advisory brings the threat of freezing rain, sleet and snow into the mountains, foothills and northern piedmont.\nWCNC Charlotte Chief Meteorologist Brad Panovich says there won't be much winter weather at all with this system. For the Charlotte area, we're only expected a very cold, miserable rain on Saturday.\nPanovich says the biggest risks with this system will be along Interstate 40 and northwest, with the potential for freezing rain, sleet and ice accumulations up to 0.1-0.15\". Totals up to a quarter inch are not likely do to the temperatures being close to freezing.\nThe ice accumulation totals for the Foothills and Mountains could range from a trace to 0.2\" of freezing rain. Here are the problems ice can cause. Sleet mixing in could likely bring these totals way down. @wcnc pic.twitter.com/AWieEyQ4Qx\n— Chris Mulcahy (@YOURWEATHERMAN) January 5, 2024 Those areas include Asheville, Lake Lure, Morganton, McDowell County, Ashe County, Watauga County, Burke County, Caldwell County, Alexander County and Wilkes County. Charlotte could see a brief mixing or change over to sleet before sunrise. By mid to late morning there is even a chance for thunderstorms.\n\"There could be minor adjustments, but I will say overall, I expect this to be a minor event,\" Panovich said. \"It's an inconvenient Saturday morning for travel in these areas for about a six- or seven-hour window. Other than that, we're not expecting any power outages, we're not expecting trees to come down and we're not expecting a huge, significant ice storm, snowstorm or anything like that.\"\nRELATED: Brad Panovich's winter snow outlook\nFor the winter lovers out there, we get your frustration. Charlotte just recorded its first calendar year without even a trace of snow . That record dates back all the way to 1878. So if you love snow and wintry weather, you're probably getting antsy. So let's get to it.\nClick here to sign up for the daily WCNC Charlotte newsletter\nMore Videos Next up in 5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nNext up in 5\nExample video title will go here for this video\nIce, ice baby Panovich said the primary reason this won't be a big snow maker or winter storm is the lack of cold air. Panovich said that air is expected to move out quickly. Some of it will be trapped against the mountains, which is why the biggest ice risk is in the foothills, because the Charlotte area won't have enough cold air for anything besides rain.\n\"Early on Saturday we could see a quick glazing of ice but because the high pressure is gone, and now the winds are switching around to the southeast, we're going to see things warm up,\" Panovich said.\nYou also have to take into consideration that freezing rain warms the atmosphere. When you cool rain enough to make ice, that energy goes into the atmosphere, raising the temperature, Panovich explained. As a result, there's less cold air and the freezing rain transitions to regular rain.\n\"Right now the Boone area, I think it starts to snow, changes to ice, and yes, even rain,\" Panovich said. \"Hickory, this is the area where we see ice the longest. So think Morganton, Lenoir, Taylorsville and into the Statesville area. It changes to rain for Gastonia and Charlotte and the surrounding areas. Around the Mecklenburg metro area, that's where we'll see a brief mix of ice in the morning and by 8 or 9 o'clock it changes to rain. For Monroe and Rock Hill, I think it's just solid rain.\"\n.",
