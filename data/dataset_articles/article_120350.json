  "text": "Cold winter weather can mean extra faff on a frosty morning to de-ice your car&apos;s windscreen. Whether you go for scraping, shop-bought de-icer or a jug of warm water, it takes up precious time before the commute or the school run.\nBut one weatherman in the USA reckons he has a trick that will clear your screen quickly using two everyday items. Ken Weathers, who works in Tennessee, said to mix one-third water with two-thirds isopropyl or rubbing alcohol together in a spray bottle before simply applying it to the screen, the Express US said Today reported.\nIn a video, he said: “The reason this works is rubbing alcohol has a freezing point of 128 degrees below freezing, so you can always keep this mixture in your car, and it’ll never freeze.\"\nOne viewer commented on Weathers’ video asking if the clearing technique was safe for car paint.\nWeathers responded: “Won’t harm it. Hence the dilution with water (70% isopropyl already is 30% distilled).\n“And you aren’t spraying the car with it [all over]. Just small amounts on the windshield. If you’re still worried, wipe [the] windshield with cloth to dry it.\nWeathers further explained that this hack isn’t something you’d use every day on your car. The meteorologist clarified that winter road salt and acid rain are a more significant concern for your car’s finish.\nWeathers added: “If you wash and or wax your car when recommended (or when it is dirty) by your manufacturer, you shouldn’t have any issues with most things that come in contact with the paint’s surface.”\nThe weatherman claims to have consulted several “reputable body shops” to confirm the spray tip’s safety and effectiveness before publishing the advice online. Other drivers may prevent their windscreen from freezing altogether by covering it with a towel or bin bags overnight, securing the items’ bottoms with wiper blades and tops with painter’s tape.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
