  "text": "For Bucks County residents lamenting the lack of snow, your prayers just may be answered this weekend. The National Weather Service in Mount Holly issued an early advisory Tuesday morning indicating the chance of snow for the region this weekend. \"Right now, Bucks County is on that line of rain and snow,\" said Eric Hoerich, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly. \"There is a lot to iron out before the weekend, and a lot depends on the track of the system. \"But there is the potential for wintry precipitation on Saturday night into Sunday, which will continue through most of Sunday as well,\" Hoerich added. \"We are looking at an 18-to-24 hour event, but we are still a day or two out from discussing any snow amounts.\" While the weather service cautioned against drawing any hard conclusions right now, here's everything else to know about this week's weather, leading up to the potential snow storm this weekend. Hoerich said that weather in Bucks County will be relatively calm before any storm to come. \"The rest of the week will be pretty quiet overall. There may be a few light snow showers on Thursday morning, but nothing to worry about,\" Hoerich said. \"Temperatures will be seasonal through Friday, before a colder air mass works its way in on Friday night and Saturday.\" That is when Hoerich said the precipitation-generation system is likely to move in. Here is the full forecast readout from the National Weather Service : PECO work impacts traffic: Months of lane closures on routes 413, 611 beginning Tuesday for PECO work In February 2021, Bucks County had snow on the ground in some capacity every day that month. Multiple storms that winter closed schools, county buildings and made traveling throughout the region difficult as significant, accumulating snow piled onto roads. Bucks County snowed over in 2021: Snow on the ground every day: How does this winter in Bucks compare? At that time, AccuWeather meteorologist said Bucks County received roughly 25 inches of snow in February 2021 alone — the amount the county normally receives all winter. The National Centers for Environmental Information notes that 22.8 inches of snow fell in Bucks County on Feb. 2, 2021 . And Bucks County residents of a certain age may recall the 1983 storm which dropped 32 inches of snow on Doylestown. If this storm does deliver measurable snow this weekend, it will break a nearly two-year long streak of the greater Philadelphia region receiving less than one inch of snow. According to reports, 5.8 inches of snow fell in Philadelphia on Jan. 29, 2022, and Philadelphia hasn't had more than an inch of measurable snowfall since.
