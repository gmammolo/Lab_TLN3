  "text": "South Florida has beautiful weather all year long. While it may be hot during the summer, it is a bit cooler in the winter months, making it a comfortable place to be. Many people opt for home window tinting in Tamarac, Fla., and surrounding areas when it is hot, but there are good reasons to get it done during the cooler months. When adding tint to the window, any time of the year is a good time in the Sunshine State.\n\"We are not like other states, where people primarily benefit from window tint in the summer,\" explains Vince Ceraulo, president of Southern Glass Protection. \"In Florida, you get to enjoy the benefits of it all year long. Cooler weather is still a great time to install the window tint.\"\nHaving tint added during the cooler months provides homeowners with the benefits. The room will feel more comfortable once the installation is complete, which takes around 15 minutes per window. The glare will be gone from the television and computer screen. And the home's temperature will remain more consistent, which will help to reduce energy usage. This will lead to lower energy bills by as much as up to 30% each month.\nNot only is any time of the year an excellent time to have tint installed, but the benefits of having it done are felt all year long. In addition to energy savings, the tint helps protect the window projectiles during minor hurricanes. It will also help keep people from being able to see inside the home, including would-be thieves and neighbors who are being nosy. Filtering out 99% of the harmful UV rays, which also enter the house during cooler months, the tint helps to protect people, pets, furniture, and flooring. Tint can also help homeowners delay costly window replacement.\n\"People always want to know when the best time is for having the windows tinted,” said Ceraulo. \"When you live in Florida, it’s all year long.”\nSince 2000, Southern Glass Protection has completed thousands of tint installation projects. They are a family-owned and operated company, licensed and insured, a Select Pro dealer, and use only Vista window film, which is the best in the industry and comes with a 100% lifetime transferable warranty. There are various options to choose from, including gradients, patterns, frosts, etc.\nAbout Southern Glass Protection With over 20 years of experience, Southern Glass Protection is the leading window film company in the Boca Raton, Fla., area. The company offers professional residential and commercial window tinting services, helping customers reduce energy bills and add style, security, privacy, and UV protection.
