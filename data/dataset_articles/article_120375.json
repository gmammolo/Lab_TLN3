  "text": "Known by many as the state with “The Greatest Snow on Earth,” Utah is widely regarded as one of the most breathtaking winter wonderlands in the world. But, have you ever wondered why Utah has such amazing snow? The answer lies in plate tectonics. According to the Utah Geological Survey , “Snow conditions are a sum of topography, elevation, latitude, and distance to the ocean. These factors constrain climate and are shaped by a history of tectonics. Mountains govern the first two factors and all four factors govern snow—its quantity, quality, and duration.” In essence, this state sits at one of the most ideal locations to support snowy conditions. The temperatures, elevations, distance from bodies of water, and mountainous terrain all contribute to the abundance and quality of snow. Whether you’re a native or someone who’s planning on traveling to this state, you might be curious about the average snowfall Utah experiences during winter. Today, we’ll discuss the snowiest areas of Utah and explore exactly how much snow you can expect during the colder months! The population in Utah is roughly 3.34 million. ©yoshimedia/Shutterstock.com We know that it snows a lot in Utah, but how much does it snow exactly? Because of the great variance in elevation and terrain across the state, different locations will experience different levels of snowfall throughout the year. We’ll discuss specific locations in a bit, but on average, Utah experiences roughly 60 inches of snowfall per year. The state of Utah is sometimes referred to as the “beehive state.” ©iStock.com/DCrane08 Although Salt Lake City, the state capital of Utah , receives an impressive yearly annual of five feet of snow, this is a small amount compared to other locations. The snowiest place of all is Alta, which is located in Little Cottonwood Canyon. This town experiences somewhere between 37 and 45 feet of snow per year. The town of Alta experienced a mind-blowing 903 inches of snow in the 2022-23 season. This decimated its previous record by over 150 inches of snow, which occurred in the winter of 1982-83. Summit City is another extremely snowy location, with a yearly average of 28 feet of snow. Cities with the least amount of snow include St. George and Washington, which both average roughly two inches per year. There’s no denying that Utah is one of the snowiest locations in the United States. However, it is also one of the most beautiful places as well, and the quality of the snow is as good as it gets. Those who enjoy winter sports such as skiing, sledding, and snowboarding will undoubtedly fall in love with this state. Even individuals who prefer to stay cozy inside will be sure to enjoy the picturesque beauty of the snow. Just be sure to pack properly and bundle up when going outdoors. This way you can get the most out of the state with the greatest snow on Earth! The post Snow in Utah: See the Snowiest Places and Average Amounts appeared first on A-Z Animals .",
