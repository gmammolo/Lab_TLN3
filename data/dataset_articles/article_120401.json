  "text": "ABIDJAN, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast on Tuesday said there were good prospects for the April-to-September mid crop despite very little rainfall across all cocoa regions.\nThe world's top cocoa producer is its mid-November-to-March dry season. Rainfall is sparse during this period.\nThe season also coincides with dry Harmattan winds that blow south from the Sahara between December and March, and can damage crops.\nSeveral farmers said flowers and cherelles were abundant, and that many beans from the October-to-March main crop would be leaving the bush until mid-February as pods were ripening.\nThey said their focus had shifted to the weather's impact on the mid crop.\n\"There are enough flowers and cherelles for the mid crop. If we have good rain these months it will be better for the next steps,\" said Salame Kone, who farms near the western region of Soubre, where 2.8 millimetres of rain (mm) fell last week, 2.1 mm below the five-year average.\nSimilar conditions were reported in the southern regions of Agboville and Divo and in the eastern region of Abengourou, where there was no rain last week.\nThere was also no rain in the centre-western region of Daloa and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro.\nFarmers there said the intensity of Harmattan winds had dropped.\n\"Everything is going well for the trees. We have big pods for this month and for next month. The mid crop is also starting well,\" said Albert N’Zue, who farms near Daloa, where rainfall last week was 2.7 mm below the five-year average.\nCocoa cooperatives and farmers said bean buyers for major exporters and grinders were paying 1,050 CFA francs ($1.78) per kilogram, 50 more than the guaranteed price of 1,000 CFA francs ($1.69).\nThey said it was an attempt to attract more farmers as they feared a lack of beans meant they would be unable to honour their contracts.\nAverage temperatures ranged between 27.9 Celsius (82.22 Fahrenheit)and 29C this week.\n($1 = 591.5000 CFA francs)\n(Reporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly Editing by Sofia Christensen and Barbara Lewis)\n(( ;))\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",
