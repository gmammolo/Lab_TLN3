  "text": "Chilly weather may find you inside by the fire, but keeping up your exterior’s charm in the winter isn’t as tricky as you’d think. While you can’t rely on a lush green lawn to enhance your curb appeal, there are plenty of things you can do that go a long way to making your home look inviting from the streetside during the cold months. And many of them won’t take a lot of time or money, leaving you plenty left over for sipping hot cocoa.Consider these ways to improve your exterior in winter:No matter the season, a front door makeover can change the look of your house in a hurry. Your front door is one of the first things people notice and the first part of your house they move through. Use a bright, bold color to draw attention to the front door and make it a focal point. Or replace it entirely—at an average cost of $1,100—for a striking new look.Use landscape lighting to paint your yard with light and shadow. A few simple lighting tricks can make a big difference in how your yard looks. For example, you might illuminate a tree to highlight its winter silhouette or cast light on the best features of your home. Consider hiring a lighting pro to help with this; their expertise can make a real difference in the final look, and they’ll have tips on vital questions such as how to aim the lights so they don’t add glare to your neighbor’s view. Lighting also plays a role in safety and security, so ensure that lights in your yard illuminate walkways and paths.Add cold-season plantings like primroses, pansies, heather, and cyclamen to pots and window boxes. If it’s too cold for flowers, use seasonal greens and branches instead. No porch? No problem. Place pots on your stoop and add a new doormat. Don’t overlook how much even minor decorations can add a splash of color and interest. Even a simple seasonal wreath on the front door can make a difference.Don’t forget the importance of basic maintenance, either. Keep the sidewalks cleanly and neatly shoveled to make your curb appeal that much sharper.Plan ahead now to give your yard permanent color and texture even in the bleakest months with evergreen hedges, small trees or glamorous topiary. Perennial grasses don’t need to be cut back until spring, adding variety to your winter landscape, and they can often be planted in winter. Look up your winter hardiness zone with the USDA ( planthardiness.ars.usda.gov ) to find out what perennials will best thrive in your region.",
