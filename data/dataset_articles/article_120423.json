  "text": "With winter in New England officially upon us, it’s time to start thinking about the perfect way to warm up this season.\nOne of the best ways to do just that is with a visit to\nTopnotch Resort in Stowe, Vermont. If you haven’t been lately, you’re in for a treat.\nLocated on 120 acres at the base of Mount Mansfield, the luxury property “blends the gracious charm of a ski lodge with the luxurious amenities of a world-class resort.”\nWhether you are a skier, snowboarder, or just love the outdoors, this all-season property offers something for everyone. They recently introduced new pickleball courts and have also refurbished their tennis courts featuring four indoor and six outdoor courts.\nThe property boasts a variety of rooms and suites to choose from designed for individuals to families. You can even bring your four-legged friend here as they have a collection of pet friendly rooms available.\nDeluxe King rooms conveniently located on the first and second floors for quick outdoor access for your pooch are outfitted with a king bed, 42” HD flat-screen TV, and granite and tile bathroom.\nDesigned for special occasions, the Gold Brook Suite has two bathrooms, a separate living room with fireplace, furnished walk-out deck, and a hidden Murphy bed for additional guests. They even have a collection of private resort homes available for the ultimate getaway for the entire family.\nAfter a day of adventure, you’ll want to be sure to book a treatment at the on-site 35,000-square-foot award-winning\nTopnotch Spa.\nThey recently introduced a magnesium massage designed to promote energy, sleep, and circulation. Choose between an indulgent 50- or 80-minute detoxifying treatment that starts off with a soothing massage followed up with a mineral wellness lotion to nourish the skin. Other signature treatments include a CBD massage, botanical crush scrub, collagen boost facial, and craniosacral therapy.\nTheir salon also offers a variety of hair services, including color, cutting, and highlighting. You can even indulge in a deluxe manicure or pedicure for the ultimate in relaxation. There are even personal training sessions offered for both individuals and couples.\nThe on-site restaurant known as\nThe Roost offering daily breakfast, lunch and dinner provides another excuse to never have to leave the property. Executive Chef Dustin Johnson recently joined the culinary team here. For breakfast, elevated fare features house made corned beef hash with two eggs; a veggie omelet with spinach, caramelized onions, roasted pepper, local tomatoes, and Cabot cheddar cheese; avocado toast; and a traditional breakfast.\nFor dinner, the cozy restaurant with fireplace serves up flavor-filled starters like smoked duck flatbread, crab eggrolls, a Vermont cheese and charcuterie board, deviled eggs with crispy prosciutto, and delicious dry-rubbed chicken wings served with a side of tangy Alabama white sauce.\nWhen it comes to main events, try one of their standouts dishes: a 12-ounce ribeye or pan-seared halibut. Other entrees include fish and chips, lamb Bolognese, braised short rib, chicken pot pie, and vegetable curry.\nYou can work off all those extra calories with a few laps in the indoor or two outdoor pools or get in touch with Mountain Ops Outdoor Gear located on property to arrange for biking, hiking, or fishing excursions. They also provide horseback and carriage rides available through the Equestrian Center at Topnotch.\nTopnotch Resort is located at 4000 Mountain Road in Stowe, Vermont.",
