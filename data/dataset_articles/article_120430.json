  "text": "BARTLESVILLE, Okla. — The Bartlesville area is moving out of the drought stages as water continues to flow into the city's primary water supply source, Hulah Lake, after heavy rains in southeastern Kansas during Christmas weekend. The City of Bartlesville has lifted water restrictions after heavy rains filled Hulah Lake. \"Rains that started over the Christmas holiday have had a significant impact on our water supply, increasing Hulah Lake levels by 3.5 feet as of today,\" Water Utilities Director Terry Lauritsen said. \"Now, a week later, water continues to flow into the lake. This has moved us out of all stages of the Water Shortage Ordinance for the first time since December 2022.\" Bartlesville's overall water remaining is 72.1%, which is about 20% higher than it was a month ago. Bartlesville city leaders say it’s not a matter of if, but when the city will have to up its water restrictions. The city is also looking into emergency water supply plans, for if the drought continues. Weighted water supply is sitting at 128% which exceeds the required 95% for stage one of the water shortage ordinance. \"Because we rely most heavily on Hulah Lake for our water supply, as that is where we have the most water right, we really couldn't be in a better situation than we are now,\" Lauritsen said. \"Hopefully, we will continue to see enough rain in the Hulah watershed to keep us out of all drought contingency plan stages as we continue to seek additional water sources to meet future weather and climate-related challenges.\" Some people in Bartlesville are going to be paying more for water as the town brings in restrictions and a rate increase to deal with a water shortage. Even though Bartlesville and surrounding water customers have seen an improvement, other communities that rely on Copan Lake are still struggling with drought issues. \"They desperately need rain in the Copan Lake watershed area,\" said Lauritsen. The drought continues to wreak havoc on Bartlesville’s water supply. It’s just over half capacity leaving many families rationing their water usage.",
