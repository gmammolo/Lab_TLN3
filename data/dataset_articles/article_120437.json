Many years, there’s a good chance the first major snow will happen sometime in the New Year. And that time for the East Coast might be a\nbig winter storm this weekend. It’s this unpredictability that makes a generator a purchase for all seasons. Luckily, Jackery—who makes some of our favorite solar generators—is offering its fantastic Explorer 2000 PRO portable power station for a whopping 37% off.\nJackery Explorer 2000 PRO Portable Power Station $1,199 (Was $1,899)\nNick Hilden\nAccording to\nour review, this generator is a great backup power source for people who live in blackout-prone areas or on an off-grid worksite. It’s also light for road trippers and van-lifers. It’s extremely user-friendly, and output ports ensure you can plug in a wide range of devices and electrical equipment.
