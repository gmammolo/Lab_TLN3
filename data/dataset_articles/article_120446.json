  "text": "Gallatin County Sheriff Search & Rescue made its first rescue of a backcountry skier this winter season this past Friday, when volunteers aided a skier out of Beehive Basin.\nThe skier had hit a rock and injured her ankle, which left her unable to ski out of the popular backcountry skiing area northwest of Big Sky Resort, according to a press release . Volunteers for GCSSAR found the skier, administered first aid and packaged the injured skier for safe transport to the trailhead. From there, the skier drove off on her own to receive further medical care.\nGallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer commended the skier and her backcountry partner in the release for the pair’s emergency communication plan. The two also brought equipment that would have allowed them to make an extended stay in the backcountry if needed.\nThe level of preparedness the two displayed is not the norm, said Jason Revisky, management duty officer.\n“People often plan for the best day as opposed to planning for the worst day,” he said.\nRevisky said GCSSAR recommends people bring enough warm clothes and supplies to survive at least one night in the backcountry, including fire-starting materials and emergency shelter. He also emphasized the importance of communications devices that function outside of cell service, such Garmin InReach or SPOT device. Many of Montana’s popular recreation areas are out of service.\nAlthough incidents can happen at any time, under any conditions, Revisky said GCSSAR worries most when avalanche danger is high, or temperatures are particularly cold. Neither is the case in current regional conditions with low avalanche danger across the board and temperatures hovering in the double-digits.\nAvalanche danger is low due to the sheer lack of snow, said Doug Chabot, director of the Gallatin National Forest Avalanche Center. The currently snowpack is very weak, faceted and sugary, but not unstable — but Chabot said this is only because there’s no slab layer on top of the facets.\nThe last known slab avalanche in the region occurred on Dec. 25 in the Bridger Range.\nHowever, Chabot said, because the existing layer of snow currently is so weak, avalanche danger will rise very quickly with any new snow.\nThe mountains around Bozeman can expect 1 to 3 inches over the weekend, with the lower elevation areas to receive one inch, if any, according to Amanda Wilson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Great Falls. Wilson said the coming snow doesn’t appear to be a robust storm system.\n“Normally 3 inches of snow is nothing like we don’t even worry about that in a lot of cases,” Chabot said. “But in this case, it’s been so long since it’s snowed that any snow that falls is a concern for us right now.”\nIn the meantime, Chabot said skiers, snowboarders and snowmobilers should be aware of the thin snowpack and hazards that it brings such as more prominent rocks and trees.\nAdditionally, Revisky and Chabot encourage adventure-goers to look at the GNFAC website ( mtavalanche.com ) for all the information needed to plan ahead and stay safe in the backcountry.\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters Lorea Zabaleta can be reached at lzabaleta@dailychronicle.com .",
