  "text": "“`html\nDarwin records warmest start to a year in almost 90 years.\nDarwin records warmest start to a year in almost 90 years\nA delayed start to the wet season has resulted in stifling heat in Darwin, making it the city’s hottest start to a year since 1935. Warm nights and high humidity have contributed to the extreme temperatures, with minimum temperatures only falling to a clammy 29.9 degrees overnight on January 1. The effects of El Niño are causing a delay in the monsoon, and the forecast predicts that the hot and sweaty conditions will continue for at least the middle of January.\nEffects of El Niño and delayed monsoon\nAustralia is experiencing the effects of El Niño, which is known to delay the monsoon, as observed this season. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecasted that Darwin will continue to experience hot weather for the rest of the week, with showers and thunderstorms expected for the Top End.\nExtreme temperatures exacerbated by humidity\nWhile temperatures hitting the high-30s in summer may not be unusual elsewhere in the country, Darwin’s extreme humidity can exacerbate the heat. Dew point temperatures in the mid-to-high 20s made it feel about 3 to 6 degrees warmer than it actually was for most of Monday and Tuesday in Darwin, with Monday’s noon temperature of 34.8 degrees feeling more like 40 degrees.\n“`\nPhoto Credit: imageresizer.static9.net.au",
