  "text": "Christmas is over and we Brits are in for a long few months of cold, dark winter weather. But, those of us lucky enough to be able to get away for a short time will surely be looking for places to fly to that offer sunshine and warmer days. Luckily, there’s one town in Europe that’s been named one of the sunniest spots on the continent – and it’s also a great place for \"workations\", according to Holidu . A workation is when you hop on a flight abroad but don’t need to take time off work while out there as you can work remotely perhaps from your balcony, villa or by the pool. Valencia, in Spain, is the perfect spot for those looking for both sun and a good place to work for a short while (so long as it complies with working abroad regulations). The city sees average temperature highs of 16C in January meaning it’s pleasantly sunny and warm. Meanwhile in August the weather is much hotter at a blissful high of 31C. READ MORE: Lesser-known Greek island has white beaches, castles, seals and stays from £4.50pp READ MORE: Lesser-known island has £1 cocktails, £5 hotels and beaches that rival the Maldives Not only that, but the historic city is also right on the coat with a huge white sand beach in the middle of town and bright blue water. Palm trees sway on the streets and the pretty red roofed white buildings mean it’s a very romantic city for holidaymakers to get lost in. Of course for those lunch breaks and after-work adventures, the city is teeming with fun things to do. The most famous is the science and arts museum Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias where you can stare out of the huge windows at the water surrounding the building. It’s considered one of the 12 treasures of Spain and costs just £7.55 to enter and watch the laser shows, visit the planetarium and observe the avant-garde architecture. You can also see operas, concerts and performances art the Palau de les Arts. Alternatively, wander the medieval streets and admire the many churches, towers, cathedral and plazas that fill the streets and draw the eyes. Or, head over to L'Oceanogràfic – an oceanarium where different marine habitats have been recreated. If you’re willing to pay a little more then you can join a guided tour of the caves of San Jose via boat. Or, take a catamaran cruise to see the sunset. You can also spend a day out exploring waterfalls and thermal springs. Just make sure you bring your swimwear as you’ll be hopping in the warm water to enjoy swimming in the sunshine. Fancy going out for dinner? You should head to the Old Town where you can enjoy all the wine and tapas you like as you hop from bar to bar, while Get Your Guide also offers tapas and wine tour of the area plus you’ll dine in an 11th Century monument. Anyone who fancies a bit more exercise can go on a guises hike in the natural paradise that is Montanejos. Or, go on a jeep safari in the mountains. The stunning city has plenty of nightlife to enjoy too from evening flamenco shows to nightclubs, techno temples and even one unusual spot called Latex that will blow you away. It really is a city with something for everyone from the pool loungers, to the always-on-the-go families and those who like to stay up late! The city is also great value for money for us Brits. A flight, according to Skyscanner , will set you back from just £26 for a return. While a pint when you arrive will set you back an average of £3.64 which isn’t the cheapest but is well below many spots in the UK and, if you want a few bottles at your villa you can find them at the supermarket from 81p. You’ll be able to make savings on accommodation too if you choose wisely. Those who want to save as much as possible can book a bed in a dorm hostel for around £24 a night according to booking.com. That’s not for everyone though so the cheapest private space we could find was a double room at Limin Hostel Capsules at a cost of £34 a night. You can also get a double room at the ibis budget Valencia Centro Puerto from about £50 a night.",
