  "text": "It wouldn’t be an overstatement to say that the travel industry has a habit of inventing buzzwords: staycation, babymoon, glamping, bleisure, ­jetiquette – the list goes on. But what of this weekend’s “Sunshine Saturday”?\nActually, we will allow that one, because it does carry a certain weight. It is, you see, that very thing – the crucial first Saturday of the year, when we look up from the crumbs of the final mince pie, and remember that the next few weeks are going to be grim. Christmas is over, and December has packed away its festive sparkle, leaving in its place the cold drudgery of January and February, a March that is barely better, and an April that can’t come soon enough. No wonder the first day of the first full weekend of the year is the moment we collectively say “enough of this, I need a break.”\nThat’s the thinking, anyway. “Sunshine Saturday” is supposedly the holiday industry’s busiest day of the calendar; a frantic 24 hours when more than a million Britons either go online or visit a high-street travel agent to book their next getaway. And not a weekend in the Cotswolds or a round-the-world cruise either, although these can be excellent ideas – but the traditional seven-night dash to the sun. Anything but face another morning of swirling rain without a few days of hot-weather respite scrawled somewhere in the diary.\n“Sunshine Saturday” is supposedly the holiday industry’s busiest day of the calendar Credit : Reinhard Schmid So where to go? It’s a good question, particularly if you would rather throw a few things into a bag and run to the airport before winter is out – rather than wait for high summer.\nHere we present a trio of options for each of the next four months, bracketed into three simple categories: Warm (15-18 Celsius); Warmer (19-22C); Warmest (23C+). The only other factor is that these are all short-haul trips, keeping to Europe or the fringes of Africa and Asia.\nYou can, of course, go further; Dubai and the Caribbean rarely seem more enticing than when the new-year wind is howling outside. But if you fancy a dose of vitamin D without having to cross an ocean, your answer may be below...\nJanuary Ah, January, the least-loved of all months. The weather is foul, the sun sets almost as soon as it rises, and your friends are insisting on four weeks of sobriety. If ever there were a time for an impulsive holiday, it’s now…\nWarm: Tenerife (18C) Proper warmth can be hard to find in Europe in the first weeks of the year. Even the parts of the continent that are politically European – but geographically African – struggle to muster anything that might be considered a heatwave amid the January gloom.\nThis includes the largest Canary Island, whose image as a haven of guaranteed winter sun can be a little over-egged. That said, Tenerife is far hotter than the UK in these early pages of the diary, and while there are many reasons to visit Spain’s greatest outpost – cool capital Santa Cruz, the epic slopes of Mount Teide – its resort hotels are certainly reason enough.\nDo it: The south-westerly Costa Adeje is home to the island’s best resorts, including the five-star Bahia del Duque, with its Michelin-starred dining, offered by Destinology (01204 208 443; destinology.co.uk ).\nTenerife's resort hotels are reason enough to visit Credit : Getty Images Warmer: Agadir (20C) The advantage of having a vast continental landmass and the dunes of the Sahara behind it gives Morocco’s southernmost holiday hotspot a small temperature edge over its Canarian near-neighbour.\nOnly 425 miles and a smidgeon of latitude separate Tenerife and Agadir – and while the chief Canary has a broader selection of hotels and a wider range of flight connections, its North African cousin is becoming an increasingly popular choice for Europeans fleeing the winter.\nThe quality of its beaches helps. Both Plage d’Agadir (in the city) and Plage Aourir (a little to the north) offer splendid curves of sand.\nDo it: A seven-night all-inclusive stay at the Iberostar Founty Beach Hotel (a comfy four-star property on the city’s main beach), flying out of Gatwick on January 20, costs from £459 per person – through Love Holidays (01234 230 440; loveholidays.com ).\nTenerife's North African cousin is becoming an increasingly popular choice for Europeans fleeing the winter Credit : Shutterstock Warmest: Senegal (26C) If you want upper-Twenties heat in January without crossing an ocean, Africa is the nearest realistic option. But you don’t have to go all the way to Cape Town to see the sun on its best behaviour. Since November 2022, Tui has offered direct flights from Gatwick to Dakar, putting Senegal on the menu for mainstream package holidays.\nAdmittedly, the distance and time involved (2,700 miles; six hours) pushes the idea of “short-haul” to its limit – but the welcome feel of 26C on your skin should make the journey worthwhile.\nDo it: Tui is not the only major travel company to dip a toe into Senegal. The Spanish hotel giant Riu is another recent arrival in the West African country, operating the five-star Riu Baobab, with its four pools and four restaurants. A seven-night all-inclusive stay, flying on January 22, starts at £988 a head (020 3451 2688; tui.co.uk ).",
