  "text": "Looking for offbeat winter destinations in India? Check out these frozen lakes that become even more beautiful when shrouded in ice and snow.\nIndia is home to more than a lakh lakes, many of which undergo a magical transformation during winters. They turn into pristine white sheets of ice, offering a unique experience to visitors. So if you’re planning to embark on a journey to witness these frozen wonders, we’ve curated\n a list for an unforgettable winter adventure.\n1. Cholamu Lake, Sikkim\nPerched at an altitude of 18,000 feet above sea level, Cholamu Lake, also known as Tso Lhamo Lake, stands as one of the highest lakes in India. Located in North Sikkim, near the border with China (Tibet), this frozen beauty is a testament to nature’s grandeur.\nSimilar Story\n<a href=\"https://www.thebetterindia.com/336262/best-indian-startup-of-the-year-2023-social-impact-heath-education-sustainability/\">\n</a>\n#BestOf2023: 8 Startups That Ruled the Year With Their Innovations & Impact\nFrom JioVio Healthcare to Goodfellows, The Better India's 'Startups of the Year' are characterised by transformative missions, ingenious innovation and inspiring impact.Read more >\nSurrounded by breathtaking Himalayan landscapes, the high altitude and extreme weather conditions contribute to the lake’s characteristic freezing during the\nwinter months.\nVisitors must obtain special permission to access the area due to its proximity to international borders. And given the sub-zero temperatures experienced in the region, it is advisable to check the weather conditions before planning a trip here.\n2. Tso Moriri Lake, Ladakh\nTso Moriri, also known as Lake Moriri or Mountain Lake, is a stunning high-altitude lake. Situated in the Changthang region of Ladakh at an elevation of approximately 15,075 feet above sea level, the lake boasts breathtaking surroundings with snow-capped peaks and barren landscapes.\nThe awe-inspiring landscape is enhanced by a chilly breeze and a pervasive sense of serenity in the air. Spanning about 19 kilometres in length and 3 to 5 kilometres in width, the lake offers a vast expanse of water set against the backdrop of the majestic Himalayas.\nAs a less frequented destination among tourists, Tso Moriri is likely to have\n fewer crowds, especially during the winter season.\n3. Roopkund Lake, Uttarakhand\nPerched at a height of approximately 16,499 feet above sea level, Roopkund Lake stands as a favourite destination for experienced trekking enthusiasts. Discovered by a forest ranger in 1942, the lake, at that time, was not frozen and revealed an intriguing sight — it was filled with human skeletons!\nThis discovery ignited interest\namong researchers, historians, and trekkers from various corners of the world. The origins of these skeletons remain a mystery, adding to the allure that continues to captivate trekkers. The most widely accepted theory, based on radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods, indicates that the skeletons date back to the ninth century and may be associated with a group of pilgrims or travellers who met their demise due to a sudden and severe hailstorm.\nOften referred to as the Skeleton Lake, Roopkund may be relatively small, but it is set against a stunning backdrop, surrounded by snow-capped peaks and rocky terrain.\n4. Changu Lake, Sikkim\nAnother enchanting lake and a popular tourist attraction in Sikkim is Changu Lake, also known as Tsomgo Lake. This glacial lake is situated in East Sikkim and remains frozen during the winter months, creating a picturesque scene against the backdrop of snow-covered landscapes.\nSimilar Story\nhttps://www.thebetterindia.com/334115/best-homestays-in-himachal-pradesh-uttarakhand-to-enjoy-snowfall-in-winter/\nPerfect Winter Getaway: 8 Himalayan Homestays You Can Snuggle In to Enjoy Snowfall\nPlanning a winter vacation in Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand?

Tourists can engage in activities such as yak rides and shop for local handicrafts and souvenirs near the lake. Lucky visitors might even catch a glimpse of a Himalayan black bear or a leopard in the surrounding area.\n5. Manimahesh Lake, Himachal Pradesh\nNestled in the heart of Chamba district, Manimahesh Lake is another frozen gem, situated at an elevation of approximately 13,500 feet above sea level. This sacred lake holds deep religious significance for Hindus, is believed to be the divine abode of Lord Shiva, and is named after the peak Manimahesh.\nEmbraced by snow-capped peaks and rugged mountains, Manimahesh Lake is renowned for its breathtaking and serene landscapes. The 13-kilometre trek to the lake from the base camp at Hadsar takes visitors through lush green meadows, dense forests, and challenging terrains.\nAs winter sets in, bringing a drop in temperatures, the lake begins to freeze, and its surroundings are blanketed in snow. The transformed landscape becomes a captivating sight, drawing both tourists and devotees alike to witness the ethereal beauty of Manimahesh Lake during this season.\n6. Dal Lake, Jammu and Kashmir\nIt would only be fair to mention this beauty when discussing frozen lakes. A widely popular tourist destination in Jammu and Kashmir, Dal Lake is a sight to behold in winter. The lake, with an average size of roughly 5 km in length and 1 km in width, is situated at an altitude of more than 5,000 feet.\nDuring winter, Dal Lake can freeze, transforming the surroundings into a winter wonderland, providing a unique experience. The lake is also renowned for its houseboats and vibrant local life.\nThe Mughal gardens, including Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh, add to the charm of Dal Lake with their well-manicured lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and historic architecture.\n7. Gurudongmar Lake, Sikkim\nAnother gem from the Northeastern states of India is Gurudongmar Lake, located near the border with China. It stands as one of the highest lakes in the world, situated at an altitude of approximately 17,800 feet above sea level.\nFed by glaciers, the lake serves as a source of streams for the Teesta River, which flows through Sikkim and West Bengal. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Gurudongmar Lake remains partially frozen throughout the winter.\nThe lake holds sacred significance for Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs. Legend has it that Guru Nanak visited the lake and blessed its waters, believed to possess healing properties. Another legend that goes around is that Guru Padmasambhava, on several requests from the locals who faced an acute shortage of water, touched a part of the lake with his walking stick blessing it to never freeze. To this day, that part of the lake remains unfrozen in peak winters.\nIf you are fortunate, you might spot some wildlife, as the region around Gurudongmar Lake is known for its alpine meadows and is home to various species — including the Himalayan blue sheep, yaks, and various exotic birds.\n8. Sela Lake, Arunachal Pradesh\nLocated at an altitude of more than 13,000 feet above sea level, Sela Lake is one of the lesser-known gems in Arunachal Pradesh. Situated near the Sela Pass, the lake takes its name from this mountain pass.\nBoth Sela Pass and Sela Lake are integral parts of the route leading to the town of Tawang, renowned for its monasteries, natural beauty, and cultural significance.\nDuring the summer months, the lake transforms into a stunning beauty with pristine blue waters set against the backdrop of towering mountains. However, come winter, Sela Lake dons a white blanket, remaining frozen for the majority of the winter season.\n9. Pangong Tso, Ladakh\nAnother well-known destination in Ladakh, Pangong Tso is the kind of natural beauty that makes you feel alive. The lake is at a high altitude, approximately 14,270 feet above sea level in the Eastern Ladakh region near the\nLine of Actual Control (LAC) with China. The lake is known for its pristine blue waters that freeze during the winter giving a unique view of the landscape.\nPangong Tso is one of the highest saltwater lakes in the world. Its high altitude and the surrounding landscape contribute to the unique charm of the place. Make sure you pack warm clothes and keep an eye on restrictions, such as roadblocks due to heavy snowfalls, if you are planning a trip.\n10. Suraj Tal, Himachal Pradesh\nSuraj Tal, which translates to ‘Lake of the Sun’, sits at an elevation of approximately 16,040 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest lakes in India.\nLocated in the Himalayan region, specifically in the Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh, the lake is situated on the Manali-Leh Highway, providing accessibility to travellers along this route.\nFed by the glaciers of the Baralacha La pass, Suraj Tal holds sacred significance for the locals. It is believed that taking a dip in its waters can cleanse one of their sins. The lake is also a frequented destination for trekkers and adventure enthusiasts as part of their journey along the Manali-Leh Highway.\n(Edited by Pranita Bhat)\nTell Us More\nSimilar Story\nhttps://www.thebetterindia.com/332187/bookclubs-in-indian-cities-like-kolkata-kochi-bengaluru-that-every-reader-should-join/\nBuilding a Reading Habit?
