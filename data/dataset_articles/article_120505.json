  "text": "Heating the person and not the home is advice often given to people struggling to pay their bills with Martin Lewis being one of those people handing out such tips.\nDue to the cost of living crisis, staying warm for less has been a top priority for many of us and during winter time as we experience darker and colder nights, we need to find ways to keep ourselves warm.\nAs a result, plenty of cost-effective hacks have been doing the rounds, with one of the latest wowing homeowners being\nhot water bottle feet warmers. And it's great for if you're always that person who seems to have cold feet no matter the weather.\nREAD MORE:\nRevlon Hair Dryer and Volumiser 'better than Dyson Airwrap' slashed in price\nREAD MORE:\nThe £16 heated hoodie keeps me warm all day and stops me putting the heating on\nShoppers have been praising the\nWARMTUYO Foot Warmer, reports Berkshire Live, which is currently on offer for £9.99, down from £22.99. And it has left many impressed.\nAccording to\nAmazon, the \"lightweight and portable\" hot water bottle foot warmer is made up of \"machine washable super soft flannel\", that is \"exceptionally durable and warm\". After filling the bottle up with hot water, it'll \"stay warm for a couple of hours\", while the heated slippers have a \"360° surround design\".\nThe bottom also features an \"anti-slip\" design, and can be used \"for warm feet and hands or as a travel pillow.\" The product could also be beneficial in relieving pain and soreness as foot heating is said to help increase blood circulation and relaxation.\nAmazon adds: \"Protect your feet from low blood circulation, arthritis, and cold floors. Hot water bottle helps relieve cold hands and feet, low back pain, dysmenorrhea, arthritis pain, sports injury, convulsions and stomach pains.\"\nAs it stands, the\nfoot warmer has been given a solid 4.4 out of five-star rating, with hundreds of reviews and one calling it \"pure bliss\".\nOne said: \"Does as intended - heats the feet cheaply and effectively\". A second said: \"I have always suffered from Cold Feet and this little Feet warmer is a dream come true!\" in her five-star review meanwhile another wrote: \"Best purchase of 2023!\"\nWant the latest food and drink news?

It is basically a hot water bottle with a fluffy cover.\" However, they explained: \"My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the stitching has started to come undone on the bit that makes feet compartments which is making it feel loose now.\"\nAnother penned: \"The quality is good, but I find the foot holes are too narrow when you're wearing thick socks, which I do in the winter time!\"\nThere are a variety of other hot water bottle foot warmers on the market, as well as several other types, such as electrical warmers. Amazon is also selling a\ngiant hot water bottle slipper for £19.99.\nAs well as this, B&Q has a similar looking one\nhttps://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1585160&xs=1&xcust=Regionals-EdinburgLive--28230140-&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.diy.com%2Fdepartments%2Fgrey-foot-warmer-hot-water-bottle%2F5056713200317_BQ.prd available for £11.99.\nSign up to our daily Edinburgh Live\nnewsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox",
