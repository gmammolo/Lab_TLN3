  "text": "“We are collecting a very unique data set crucial to understanding climate change at a unique environment like this. What happens up here is eventually gonna trickle down to the valley.” –Observer Charlie Peachey\nWe’ve often heard that the summit of New Hampshire’s Mount Washington has the “worst weather on earth” so whats it like to live there? Check out this piece by\nNews Center Maine as they join the folks at the Mount Washington Observatory to get an idea of what the job entails.\nObservers work 8 days with 12 hour shifts on at the highest point in the Northeast and then get 6 days off. While on the clock they monitor data, educate the public and diligently go outside every hour to take measurements often using analog tools as they are more reliable than electronic alternatives.\nThe conditions are extreme but when indoors observers have a relatively comfortable existence with hearty meals, streaming services and resident cat named Nimbus that oversees operations (Nimbus is believed to the 18th such feline employee).\nShoutout to the observers at Mount Washington and all the weather professionals across the country and the earth who work hard everyday to provide us best possible information. We appreciate you!!!",
