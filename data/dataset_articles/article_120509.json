  "text": "Happy Thursday! Mother Nature is cooking up quite the beautiful day across the Inland Northwest today. Temperatures are five to 10 degrees above where they usually are for the last week of December, and they'll be combined with dry weather for much of Eastern Washington both Thursday and Friday—although the LC Valley could see some pop up showers tonight and tomorrow afternoon. Expect partly cloudy skies throughout much of the region, with high temps in the low to mid 40s and overnight lows in the low to mid 30s. Areas in the Cascades will see showers—snowfall in higher elevations—off and on today and Friday, but they won't make their way to our neck of the woods like they did earlier this week. We're tracking a pattern shift Saturday night into Sunday, with some potential for light precipitation to return to the forecast. Still not quite sure on the exact location, timing and type of precipitation at this point, but we should be getting a better idea over the next 24 hours. Have a great Thursday!",
