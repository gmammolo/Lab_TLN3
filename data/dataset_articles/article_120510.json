  "text": "While it certainly isn't sunbathing weather at the moment, these Norfolk beaches are perfect for a winter walk. We asked our social media followers where their favourite beaches are for a stroll and these were the most popular responses. 1. Holkham The Holkham National Nature Reserve boasts a diverse range of habitats, but it is best known for its beach with unspoilt stretches of golden sand. The beach is also a popular site for ground-nesting birds and it has featured in films such as Shakespeare in Love and Annihilation.

Winterton In this seaside village, you will find a sandy beach and dunes, with the latter a designated national nature reserve. It is a popular spot for seal watching, so make sure to check the latest guidance if visiting there or nearby Horsey during the breeding season - typically from November to January. Make sure to pop into the Seal View Café next to the car park for refreshments, [which was recently visited by Hollywood actor Tom Hiddleston.](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23720549.tom-hiddleston-spotted-seal-view-cafe-winterton/) 3. Wells Start at The Quay, home to fabulous fish and chip shops, cafés and more, and then take a stroll up the long path towards Wells Beach, which runs alongside the harbour. Step out into a vast expanse of golden sand lined with immaculately kept colourful beach huts. 4. Gorleston The beach in Gorleston was [named the best in the UK by Tripadvisor in their Travellers' Choice Awards for 2023. ](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/23351778.gorleston-on-sea-tripadvisors-top-25-beaches-europe/) It boasts golden sands and you can make a day of it after going for a walk by visiting the town's attractions, including arcades, restaurants and its charming theatre.

Cromer Cromer has so much to see and do that it can be enjoyed all year round, including its famous pier, and it is a great spot for a winter walk.
