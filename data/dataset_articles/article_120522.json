  "text": " The $12 secret to keeping scaredy-dogs calm during winter storms Izabella Zaydenberg · Deputy Editor, Commerce Updated January 3, 2024 at 9:16 PM Link\nAs much as my pup loves winter for obvious reasons — namely, the extra time her humans spend inside out of the cold, and thus snuggled up beside her — she also can’t stand the storms. She’s already a frightful pup; loud noises scare her, and a windy storm is, without fail, a recipe for her running under my bed in panic, or worse, shaking under the nearest table she can find.\nWhile I’ve tried an endless amount of calming treats with varying degrees of efficacy, there’s one that my pup Chloe and I love, and it’s wicked inexpensive: Pet Naturals of Vermont Calming Dog Chews , $12.\nAmazon Pet Naturals Calming Supplements, 30 Chews These chews are sedative-free and won’t tire your pup out — and they last for four to six hours.\n$12 at Amazon Now, they’re no replacement for basic pet parent common sense during storms: I still make sure to close all windows and draw the curtains, keep her safely inside and with her favorite plushies and blankets, either watching a TV show or listening to tail-wagging songs. These treats act as an additional barrier between her and the loud, scary storm noises I know she’ll hear, and they seriously do help.\nBoomer's winter is about to get a whole lot better. (Photo: Getty Images) The chews use a Colostrum Calming Complex Biopepide Blend, L-Theanine and Vitamin B to soothe Chloe without making her sleepy or drowsy. They’re sedative-free and won’t tire her out; they last for four to six hours and start working up to 20 minutes after ingesting. They also reportedly taste delicious, as my furbaby runs straight to me when she sees me opening up the packet. They’re soft and easy to chew, so if your pet is older or has dental issues like Chloe, she’ll have an easier time with this than her kibble.\nGive half a chew for dogs up to 25 pounds, one chew for dogs between 25 and 50 pounds and two chews for dogs 51 to 100 pounds. Increase if needed. (Photo: Amazon) And they're not just for storms: I use mine whenever Chloe's being particularly antsy, like if there’s construction noise, or if she’s about to go to the vet. Other shoppers use them to help combat separation anxiety, jumpiness and even aggression. Another great time to break 'em out? Whenever someone in the neighborhood is setting off fireworks, whether on the Fourth of July or the just-passed New Year's Eve.\nPups that get upset by loud noises particularly benefit from the treat. One shopper gives her little scaredy-dog some before thunderstorms. Says the fan: \" My 55 lb. boxer mix girl will run and hide in the bathroom with no windows or bury her entire body in my pillows when I'm near my bed, trembling violently the whole time, when she hears thunder...We started out trying just one of these, and it did help significantly, along with her Thundershirt, but it works even better if she takes two (sometimes with the Thundershirt, sometimes without). I like to think of it as anti-anxiety medication. When I hear the thunder, I offer these to her, and she knows they help because she chews and swallows them right down.\"\nAnother reviewer offered the calming chews before a long trip:\n“It really works!\" says the shopper . Normally the 30-minute drive to the beach she’s whining, ready to get out and play so we got these for her first four-hour total road trip and along with a seatbelt it was so stress-less. She ate it like it was a treat — no fuss! We only gave her one and it kicked in about 30 minutes later. Our VERY active 1-year-old German will now enjoy more road trips and adventures!\"\nFor just $12, these inexpensive chews are a must-have, and if they save me the heartache of watching Chloe shake all night or worse, running around my neighborhood trying to find her, they're so worth it.\nAmazon Pet Naturals Calming Supplements, 30 Chews These chewies start working within just 20 minutes after ingesting.\n$12 at Amazon The reviews Quote: d above reflect the most recent versions at the time of publication.\nIf you have Amazon Prime , you’ll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here . (And by the way, those without Prime still get free shipping on orders of $25 or more.)\nView comments",
