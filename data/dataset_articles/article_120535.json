  "text": "December, 2023 set a new record as the warmest December in terms of average minimum temperatures, since 1901, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday. Minimum temperature refers to the temperature during the night and morning. In addition, when combining the minimum and maximum temperatures to calculate the 'average temperature' or 'average mean', December in 2023 was the hottest in 122 years.According to the minimum temperature, December 2023 was the hottest in history with the average minimum temperature remaining 1.71 degrees Celsius, more than normal. The IMD shared that the average mean temperature for December also remained the highest in history. The monthly mean temperature remained at 1.11 degrees Celsius, more than normal.Notably, December 2023 was Delhi's warmest month in six years, with the city not recording a single 'cold wave day' during the month, the India Meteorological Department said, reported news agency PTI.The development comes as the weather office on Monday cautioned about coldwave days in central parts of the country for January and forecast dense fog days over parts of northwest and east India for the next three days.Addressing a press conference on the forecast for January, IMD Director General Mrutynjay Mohapatra also said that normal rainfall during the January-February-March period was expected, raising further expectations for a better wheat crop during the rabi season.However, south peninsular and north-east India could experience warmer days as above-normal monthly maximum temperatures were expected to prevail over the region in January. The weather office also said that cold-day to severe cold-day conditions were likely to continue over some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan during the next two days and decrease thereafter.Published By: Srishti JhaPublished On: Jan 4, 2024ALSO READ | 'Lower your pitch': Chief Justice Chandrachud pulls up lawyer in Supreme Court",
