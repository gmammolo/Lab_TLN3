  "text": "The past 24 hours have been a flurry up here in Tahoe... literally!\nResorts across the area delighted skiers with significant snowfall totals.\nStarting off strong, Palisades Tahoe reported 7-9 inches overnight, which is a much-needed dump after a dry couple of weeks!\nPalisades: 7-9\" overnight! Snow and cloudy skies today, high of 32 and W winds of 15mph. 16 lifts for 9a-4p:\nBase to Base\nTram\nFunitel\nExhibition\nRed Dog\nResort\nWa She Shu\nFirst Venture & Carpet\nSiberia\nGold Coast\nBelmont\nBailey's\nMtn Meadow\nCarpet\nShirley #palisadesops\n— Palisades Tahoe Mtn Ops (@palisadesops) January 3, 2024 Nearby, Northstar Resort reported 5 inches over the last 24 hours.\nFurther South, Heavenly received 3 inches over the last day, and Kirkwood got 11 inches !\nSugar Bowl also saw 11 inches overnight, and Homewood saw 4 inches at its base, with 6 at the summit.\nTo say this is exciting is an understatement. Call it the end of Shark Week, because trails have been bony.\nSiberia Express recently opened at Palisades, and it was some of the funnest terrain open right now (without hiking) until you hit a rock, which, unfortunately, is almost completely unavoidable on the ungroomed stuff!\nStill fun, but man, is it putting your skis (and finesse) to the test!\nShout out to the Big Mountain groms sending the cliffs to looker's right of Siberia. That is gnarly, and all of us chair-riders salute you for the stoke!\nTahoe Daily Snow announced that this was all according to plan, as \"the storm performed almost exactly as expected Wednesday night, with 24-hour reports from the ski areas of 3-10 inches around the lake and 10-15 inches to the south!\"\nWe were expecting 2-12\" on the mountains around the Tahoe Basin and 9-14\" to the south. The storm performed almost exactly as expected Wed night, with 24-hour reports from the ski areas of 3-10 inches around the lake and 10-15 inches to the south! https://t.co/y9kQriC8zX pic.twitter.com/GusGvGKZJX\n— Tahoe Daily Snow (@TahoeWeather) January 3, 2024 Mount Rose also saw 6-7 inches of reported fresh pow. Basically, no one's suffering out here.\n🌹Rose Report:\n❄️| 6-7\" overnight\n12°F - Wind 20-25 W - Cloudy\n🛗 Zephyr - Scheduled 8:30am\n🛗 Northwest - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Lakeview - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Galena - Scheduled 9am\n🛗 Wizard - Scheduled 9am\n🛻| Chains or Snow Tires required on 431\n— MtRoseSkiTahoe (@MtRoseSkiTahoe) January 3, 2024 We don't want to beat a dead horse here, but always remember to put those chains on (if you don't already have 4WD). No one got to the mountain first getting in an accident on the way there!\nSee you out there!\nDon't miss another headline from POWDER!
