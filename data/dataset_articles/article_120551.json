  "text": "KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Members of Kalamazoo Central's basketball teams kick-started the new year by giving back to the community. Outside in the cold rain Wednesday, freshman and junior varsity players handed out coffee and doughnuts to the homeless at three Kalamazoo parks. \"This is something that we chose to do this year,\" Kalamazoo Central Head Coach Ramsey Nichols said. \"We've done different community service events and this one here is just one where we give back to the community. We raise money every year through our Maroon Foundation and it's just something that we get together give back. Sometimes we just give it right out of our own pockets.\" Kalamazoo Central's teams had participated in community service events for the last 8-10 years. For 2024, Nichols' goal was to instill the value of giving back to the community within his players. \"I think it's a good experience for our kids to understand, you know, how people got where they are in life from certain circumstances and what not,\" Nichols said. \"You know, that's what we want them to gain from this experience.\" More information about Kalamazoo Central's Maroon Foundation can be found [online. ](https://www.kalamazoopublicschools.com/Page/2427)",
