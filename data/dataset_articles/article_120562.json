  "text": "LAKESHORE, Calif. (FOX26) — The snow is falling on Wednesday and China Peak will be reopening on Thursday. The ski resort says it got 14\" to 16\" in the base area and even more up top. China Peak says Chair 1 will be serving Upper Dynamite, Chair 2 serving Kaiser, Chair 4 serving Lower Academy, and the new Chair 6 quad will be serving Sundown Ridge and Academy with fun terrain park features, plus the beginner hill.
