  "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (KUTV) — The 2022-2023 winter season brought [record-breaking snowpack ](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-2023-snowpack-breaks-record-for-snow-water-equivalent-winter-weather-swe-usda-estimate-from-1952)to the Beehive State. By the [start of January 2023](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-well-above-normal-early-more-needed-for-good-water-year), the state's snow levels were already [off to a good start](https://kutv.com/news/local/active-start-to-weather-season-helps-utah-build-strong-snowpack-holiday-weekend-ski-utah-active-storm-track); one year later, and Utah is [not nearly as white](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-low-snowpack-raises-concerns-despite-reservoirs-remaining-mostly-full-winter-snow-weber-basin-water-conservancy-district). Many Utahns remember the [massive piles of snow ](https://kutv.com/news/local/cache-county-residents-digging-out-piles-of-snow-after-weekend-storm-wellsville-winter-weather-plow)that covered cars, signs and mailboxes throughout communities. RELATED: [Record snowfall brings challenges to Utah ski resort employees](https://kutv.com/news/local/record-snowfall-brings-challenges-to-utah-ski-resort-employees-814-inches-of-snow-snowbird-ski-resort-veteran-employees-little-big-cottonwood-poses-challenges-unprecedented-snow) [On Jan. 3](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-well-above-normal-early-more-needed-for-good-water-year), KUTV meteorologist Lindsay Storrs reported that all basins across the state were sitting between 160-190% of normal for that point in the winter. By Jan. 12, 2023, statewide snowpack was at [189% of normal](https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-snowpack-snow-survey-usda-governor-spencer-cox-water-conservation-great-salt-lake-rain) for that time of year. Solitude Mountain Resort officials said they [ hadn't seen so much snow by mid-January ](https://kutv.com/news/local/solitude-reports-most-snow-by-mid-january-in-18-years-winter-weather-ski-mountain-resort-utah-snowboard-big-cottonwood-canyon)since the 2004-2005 winter season. Despite the crowds that flocked to resorts, avalanches in the canyons were also a major concern for officials. At [Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon](https://kutv.com/news/local/public-warned-about-playing-on-snow-pile-left-by-massive-bridal-veil-falls-avalanche-provo-canyon-river-utah-county-sheriffs-office), the public was asked to stop climbing on the remains of [a massive avalanche](https://kutv.com/news/local/avalanche-piles-snow-into-provo-river-below-bridal-veil-falls) due to lingering safety concerns. This winter has been a different story thus far, with low statewide snowpack levels as of Jan. 3. Despite this, experts said reservoirs [remain mostly full ](https://kutv.com/news/local/utahs-low-snowpack-raises-concerns-despite-reservoirs-remaining-mostly-full-winter-snow-weber-basin-water-conservancy-district)because of snowpack from 2022-2023.",
