  "text": "December 2023 ended up being the second-warmest ever in Cleveland. The average high temperature was 47.4 degrees, and the average low temperature was 36.6 degrees. That means the average monthly temperature for December is 42.0 degrees. That is 7.7 degrees warmer than normal, making it the second warmest December in Cleveland, tied with 1889. If you look at the calendar graphic below, you will see A LOT more red than blue boxes. Each one of those boxes shows whether that day's average temperature was above or below normal. So, there were only four days all month long that were below average in Cleveland. December also ended up with 3.33 inches of precipitation, which is pretty close to average. Typically, Cleveland sees 2.99 inches of precipitation, so that was 0.34 inches above normal. The greatest amount fell at the end of the month on Dec. 27, with 0.72 inches.
