  "text": "It’s been a balmy start to winter so far in the Okanagan, and last Thursday, a temperature record that’s stood for over 100 years was broken in Vernon. And the new temperature record is emblematic of the past year of weather in Vernon, as 2023 was the warmest year in the city on record. According to Environment Canada, Vernon saw a high of 6.1 degrees Celsius on Dec. 28, 2023. That broke the record that was set in 1908 for Dec. 28, when the high was recorded at 5.6 C. Vernon was one of 11 B.C. communities that set a new temperature record on Dec. 28, and the only municipality in the Okanagan, according to Environment Canada. The month of December in Vernon was the fifth warmest on record since records began in 1900. The mean temperature for Vernon in December was 0.6 C. Normally, the mean temperature is -4.4 C, according to Environment Canada meteorologist Yimei Li. And looking at the entire year, Li said Vernon had its warmest year on record in 2023. The mean temperature last year was 10 C, the warmest recorded since records began in 1902, and well above the normal mean temperature of 7.7 C. “It’s been a pretty warm and dry year … (2022) was actually pretty snowy and wet,” said Li, explaining that the year before was a La Nina year and 2023 was an El Nino year, which makes for warmer and drier conditions.
