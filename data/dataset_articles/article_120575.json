  "text": "Goodbye to haze and hello to better air quality\nJan 3, 2024, 8:00 PM\n(Megan Nielsen/Deseret News)\nSALT LAKE CITY — After starting the new year with less-than-desirable air quality, Utah may finally be able to take a breath and find relief from the nasty air.\nBo Call with the\nUtah Department of Environmental Quality said better air quality is on its way.\n“Over the last 24 hours, the numbers have started to go down, and many of the locations we’re looking at have really crept down into the really low single-digit numbers,” Call said. “We’re expecting to have a storefront come through [Wednesday night] and that should clear us out.”\nCall said the more moisture a storm brings the more it erodes the inversion. From the looks of what’s coming, Utah could see relief for the next seven to 10 days, according to\nKSL Meteorologist Matt Johnson.\nJohnson said with a storm building and clouds rolling in and eroding the inversion, the air should continue to improve.\nDevin Oldroyd contributed to this story.\nRelated stories\nUtah’s air quality: haze rolling in but a potential storm on the way Great Salt Lake managers holding out hope following slow start to winter snowfall Here’s what Utah’s snowpack looks like at the start of 2024 Project conducted on fog could help to improve future fog forecasts\n ",
