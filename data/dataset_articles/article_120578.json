  "text": "CLINTON — Mason DeSantis, 5, likes snow. He got to touch snow for the first time during the family’s current visit to Iowa, said his mother, Florida first lady Casey DeSantis. He would like to take snow down to Florida, she said. “Sorry, buddy, it doesn’t work that way,” she added as an aside. He was coloring in a corner booth with a caretaker at that point. Campaigning in Clinton at Jenny’s Diner on Wednesday evening to help her husband Gov. Ron DeSantis as he chases the Republican Party nomination for president, she began her comments by telling a little bit of what it’s been like for the family on the trail. The couple also have two young daughters. The Clinton event was the final Coffee and Conversation for the day sponsored by the Never Back Down political action committee. Two room-long tables of event attendees were served a meal and pie before she arrived. The earlier events were in New Hampton, Waverly and Independence. She segued from her family stories into how candidate DeSantis is running for president to fight for his own, as well as all of the children of the people in the audience, to save the nation for them. She talked about taking power back from unelected bureaucrats, her husband standing up to critics and the media during the Covid-19 pandemic, his military service in the Iraq War, illegal immigration and drug smuggling at the southern border, how illegal immigrants in a Georgia hospital contributed to an hours-long wait for her mother to see a doctor, and how public education has become indoctrination of the country’s youth. She then took questions from the audience, but campaign workers ushered the one local reporter out of the room as the questions started.",
