  "text": "Continued tourism recovery, strong promotion and ideal weather helped to make this year’s Winter Festival of Lights a “great success.”\n“Pacing ahead of last year’s visitation and donations at Dufferin Islands,” said David Adames, chief executive officer of Niagara Parks.\n“I believe the lights look the best this year and certainly the return of the interactive lights has been very positively received.”\nPresented by Niagara Falls Tourism, in partnership with Niagara Parks, the province, Tourism Partnership of Ontario and local business improvement areas, the 41st festival of lights began Nov. 18 and concludes Sunday after 51 nights.\nIt spans eight kilometres of Niagara Parkway, with more than three million lights and 75 displays.\nLast year the festival, which ran for 101 nights between Nov. 12 and Feb. 20, was impacted by a Christmas holidays blizzard, which impacted travel to and from the popular annual free attraction.\nBut that was not the case this year.\nYou might be interested in\n“It’s been a great success,” said Janice Thomson, president of Niagara Falls Tourism.\n“We’ve had good partnerships. If you see Lundy’s Lane, they really put their heart into it and invested more funds in it and they’ve got great new light exhibits. We put some new exhibits throughout the destination. The parks had some great interactive pieces that people really enjoyed. I think from that perspective, everything was very positive.”\nThomson said the festival is one of the highlights of living in the area.\n“Because we have a lot of families in the area hosting families visiting from other areas over the holidays, it becomes an event for them to get out in the car or get out and walk around and look at the exhibits,” she said.\n“It is one of those things that’s great to see the intersection of the visitors and the residents.”\nThomson said the success of this year’s festival mirrored the overall success experienced by the local tourism sector in 2023, as it continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n“Our weather was great this year. Lots of great promotion and lots of partners working together to get the message out that it’s the 41st year, and it was free, and we had new exhibits, and we had great hotel packages and restaurant offerings.”\nShe said the more “compacted time schedule” made people realize there “isn’t that extra month to think about coming.”\n“Last year, we went right through to Family Day in February, and we found that created some pressure, particularly on giving (Niagara Parks) time to disassemble some of their displays and get going on the horticultural work that needs to be done to get their property ready for the spring,” said Thomson.\n“We were creating too much of a tension there, the timelines were too tight, so we agreed we would go to Jan. 7. It also focused us on delivering a great experience, and then it also focused us on what are we going to do after Jan. 7, what’s next for Niagara Falls?”\nWhat’s next is Niagara Falls Tourism launching a new culinary festival called Flavours of Niagara Falls, taking place Jan. 13 to Feb. 11.\nThe monthlong celebration of culinary experiences will showcase Niagara Falls’ diverse culinary scene, featuring renowned celebrity chefs, exclusive dinners and prix fixe menus at more than 20 restaurants.\n“We’re having some guest chefs that are celebrities in other areas that are coming here to pair up with some of our chefs,” said Thomson.\nFollowing that, Niagara Falls Tourism will launch a “very large” spring campaign that will best position the destination to succeed come the busy spring and summer seasons.\n“We don’t generally have a lot of marketing during the summer, but we sort of fill the pump and the funnel early in the spring and that generates the traffic through, so those campaigns are being worked on now.”",
