  "text": "Trips to the seaside may be reserved for the summer months but there’s a North Yorkshire seaside town that could buck this trend.\nThere’s something rather lovely about a blustery day by the coast but when you combine that with the fact this seaside town is actually warmer than any other part in Yorkshire, it makes it a no brainer.\nSandsend in North Yorkshire is said to have its own microclimate. This means it is warmer than any other part of Yorkshire – something that could be contributing to the town’s reputation as one of the most popular places to visit on the Yorkshire Coast .\nWith its stunning stretch of beach and breathtaking views over the Cleveland Way, thousands of tourists flock to the village every single summer. Such is its popularity, house prices in the area to surge to around £1,000,000.\nThe coastal village of Sandsend, North Yorkshire\nThe small village is about three miles from Whitby and you can see the famous Abbey and harbour in the distance while on the beach. Its in close proximity to the stunning North York Moors and opportunities to go sailing and golfing nearby also add to Sandsend’s appeal.\nBut what makes this tiny place all the more interesting and appealing to visitors is its very own microclimate – which makes Sandsend warmer than any other place in Yorkshire.\nDay-trippers from near and far flock to the beach on sunny days to enjoy the seaside towns scorching hot and sunny weather. It can often be raining in neighbouring towns such as Whitby or Scarborough but Sandsend will remain bathed in sunshine.\nThis is because coastal town has what is known as a maritime climate or oceanic climate – which essentially gives the town milder seasons, or ‘better weather’ depending on whether you prefer cold or warmth.\nIt very rarely snows, although conditions did make a treacherous drop when temperatures fell below 0C and ‘danger to life’ warnings were in place across parts of Yorkshire last month, in December.",
