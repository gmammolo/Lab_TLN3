  "text": "Jan 4, 2024, 03:53 PM IST Maintaining healthy hair requires increased blood circulation, so massage your scalp frequently. Using hot water to wash your hair can cause damage to your scalp, which can result in dryness and hair loss. If you overwash your hair, the nourishing natural oils will be lost. We really need those oils during the winter, so it is especially bad. Try extending the time between washes as much as you can. Nothing benefits your hair more in the winter than a good oil massage. In addition to being incredibly relaxing, oil massages are a great way to prevent hair loss in the winter. Drinking enough of water can help you keep your hair healthy by lowering the dryness of your strands and possibly preventing breakage. Maintaining a nutritious diet and making sure you eat enough of certain foods also contribute to healthy hair. It is preferable to let your hair air dry since blow drying causes your hair to lose moisture, increasing the likelihood that it may break. Try to wear a cap or scarf every time you step outside the house to protect your hair from the elements and the damaging effects of cold, windy days.
