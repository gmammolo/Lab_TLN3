  "text": "A charming seaside town claims to have its own 'microclimate' which reportedly makes it the warmest spot in the county.\nSandsend in North Yorkshire's unique feature, combined with its stunning beach and breathtaking views, makes it a top choice for visitors. Sandsend's popularity has caused house prices to skyrocket, with homes in the area now fetching around £1,000,000. The village is just three miles from Whitby, offering stunning views of the famous Abbey and harbour from its beach.\nAdding to its appeal are the nearby North York Moors and opportunities for sailing and golfing. But what really sets Sandsend apart is its unique microclimate, which keeps it warmer than any other place in Yorkshire.\nOn sunny days, the beach is a magnet for day-trippers who come to bask in the scorching hot and sunny weather of this seaside town. Even when neighbouring towns like Whitby or Scarborough are under rain clouds, Sandsend often stays bathed in sunshine.\nThis is due to what's known as a maritime or oceanic climate, which gives the town milder seasons - or 'better weather', depending on your preference for cold or warmth.\nSnow is a rare sight here, although last month, in December, temperatures did plunge below zero degrees. This led to 'danger to life' warnings being issued across parts of Yorkshire. Sandsend has an average temperature of a balmy 18 degrees celsius in July and August and can sometimes push the mercury into the 20s.\n* An AI tool was used to add an extra layer to the editing process for this story.
