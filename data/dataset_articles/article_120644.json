  "text": "Finding the best base layer or sailing thermal is the foundation of any layering system. It adds warmth and comfort for minimal bulk.\nWhile some elite athlete sailors may grind winches all day long, the majority of us who sail in weather cool enough to warrant wearing a base layer are static a lot of the time when afloat and will benefit from a thermal insulating layer.\nBest base layer for sailing Helly Hansen HH Lifa Stripe Crew Long Sleeve T-Shirt Helly Hansen brought performance base layers to sailing and Alpine sports with its Lifa range, characterised by the striped sleeves.\nI have used the original Lifa stripe garments for nearly two decades for lightweight insulation while exercising.\nThe 100% polypropylene Lifa construction of the Stripe garments is quick-drying and highly breathable. The synthetic material does pick up odour so this is a wear and wash garment for short periods afloat.\nBuy the Helly Hansen Lifa stripe Long sleeve top from Amazon\nWith each product is a ‘Buy it now’ link. If you click on this then we may receive a small amount of money from the retailer when you purchase the item. This doesn’t affect the amount you pay. Musto Active Base Layer Long-Sleeve Top Having relied on these for nearly a decade, I’ve found not only are they still going strong, but they remain the most comfortable base layers I’ve tried.\nDespite the synthetic mix of polyamide, polypropylene and elastane, they don’t tend to smell badly either – perhaps thanks to an anti-bacterial treatment.\nA variety of knits and weaves, including mesh and honeycomb knits, and a minimum number of seams really help provide comfort – these are base layers you really can live in.\nBuy Musto Active Top from Musto\nZEROFIT Mens Baselayer Zerofit’s Heatrub Ultimate top and leggings are made of a stretchy mix of acrylic, nylon, wool, polyester and polyurethane, with a deep pile of long fibres that traps a thick layer of warm air next to your skin, writes Rupert Holmes.\nAccording to Zerofit, extra heat is generated by friction whenever you move. I used the Ultimate top during six hours on a RIB for the start of the Vendée Globe in November. Despite the damp and wind chill from travelling at speed I stayed impressively warm without needing many additional layers.\nThe high neck also makes a telling difference in cold breeze.\nBuy Zerofit Ultimate top from Amazon\nZhik HydroMerino Zhik has established a reputation with performance sailors for its technical clothing. Its Hydrobase garments blend merino wool with synthetic fibres (polyester, polypropylene and elastane) to create durable, high-performance warmth.\nThe thermals are designed for long periods of activity and were developed with the Dongfeng Race Team during the Volvo Ocean Race.\nI’ve worn these thermals over the last couple of years, especially in the colder winter months, and particularly like the external stitching which helps reduce chafe, and the high-stretch, Lycra-like ankles and cuffs.\nOn the down side they are one of the most expensive choices and the wool content means they can sometimes feel itchy.\nBuy Zhik Hydromarino Top from Zhik\nAlso consider Finisterre Merino Merino and bamboo fibre base layers from the Cornish brand of functional and eco-conscious clothing.\nBuy Finisterre Long sleeve top from Finisterre\nGill Long Sleeve Thermal Nearly half of this synthetic fibre top comprises a performance yarn made from recycled plastic bottles.\nBuy Gill Long Sleeve Thermal from Amazon\nHow to pick the best base layer for sailing Base layers are designed to transfer/wick moisture away from the skin and in some cases to create a layer of insulation and warmth (hence the name thermals). Wicking works by capillary action from the skin to the exterior surface, so to achieve this base layers need to be tight fitting.\nA good long-sleeved base layer and trousers has long been my first garment to pack for cold weather sailing. I also wear these performance base layers for exercise from running to skiing, and through the colder winter months working in my ‘office’ – believe me, days spent in a poorly insulated shed can be as unforgiving as long stints on the rail.\nSailing base layers are typically made from synthetic fibres, such as polyester, which is good for wicking and durability, or polypropylene, known for its hydrophobic and thermal properties.\nNatural fibres such as merino wool and bamboo have also become a popular choice. Merino is naturally insulating and breathable, is soft against the skin and doesn’t pick up odours as quickly as man made materials. However, it is more expensive than polyester and takes longer to dry.\nMost sailing clothing brands now offer both natural and synthetic base layers or a composite of both, so it’s easy to find something that suits you. Cotton should be avoided as a technical layer as it absorbs moisture which then cools and makes you feel cold.\nIf you enjoyed this….
