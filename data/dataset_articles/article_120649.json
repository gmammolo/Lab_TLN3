  "text": "The Quadrantid meteor showers are set to peak Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, and NASA and the American Meteor Society say it could be the strongest meteor shower of 2024.\nThe AMS says an average of 25 meteors per hour may be seen, while NASA says to expect 120 meteors per hour during the peak.\n“Predictions for 2024 show a peak for observers viewing from North America between the local hours of 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. (Jan. 4),” the AMS states. “Rates could be quite high if observed under clear, transparent skies.”\nThe peak for these showers is relatively short, NASA notes.\n“The reason the peak is so short is due to the shower’s thin stream of particles and the fact that the Earth crosses the stream at a perpendicular angle,” NASA states.\nHow well they can be viewed will depend on the weather. On Dec. 27, AccuWeather was forecasting partially cloudy skies with a high in the low 40s for southeastern Pennsylvania.\nAnother factor affecting visibility will be the phase of the moon. The less light from the moon, the better viewing. The moon will be about 51% full Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, so it will somewhat interfere with viewing.\nIt is possible to catch some of the meteor action from the shower now, as it is listed as being active between Dec. 26 through Jan. 16.\nThe shower gets its name from the constellation from which the particles appear to emanate, Quadrans Muralis, according to NASA. The organization says the constellation is now obsolete and references shifted to the nearby Bootes constellation. An alternative name for the shower is the Bootids.\n“The constellation for which a meteor shower is named only serves to aid viewers in determining which shower they are viewing on a given night,” NASA states. “The constellation is not the source of the meteors. Also, you should not look only to the constellation of Bootes to view the Quadrantids — they are visible throughout the night sky.”\nAn added treat, NASA says, is that the Quadrantids are known for spawning bright fireball meteors, which are larger light explosions that last longer than normal meteor streaks.\nThe AMS invites viewers to report seeing a fireball on its website: https://fireball.amsmeteors.org/ .\nMeteors and fireballs are created as particles or chunks of comets or asteroids enter Earth’s atmosphere. The Quadrantids are said to originate from asteroid 2003 EH1, which was first observed at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona in 2003.\nTips “Find an area well away from the city or street lights,” NASA states. “Come prepared for winter weather with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. In less than 30 minutes in the dark, your eyes will adapt and you will begin to see meteors.”\nThe Berks County Amateur Astronomy Society has shared a light pollution map of southeastern Pennsylvania to plot out the best spots to view nighttime aerial phenomenon.
