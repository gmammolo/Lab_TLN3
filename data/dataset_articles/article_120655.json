  "text": "Every snowflake that falls from the sky seems magical, ready to transform our landscapes into a fairytale canvas. But these delicate crystals are also the source of many logistical challenges that can complicate people's daily lives. Snowfall can have a limiting, even dangerous impact, even more so when the winds are raging, visibility is reduced and you are unable to move.\nSnowy roads make driving difficult In winter, snow and road driving don't mix. This is because snowfall creates unfavorable driving conditions and drivers must be extra vigilant to ensure everyone's safety.\nDecreased visibility and slippery ground\nThe combination of suspended snow and snow that has fallen to the ground significantly reduces visibility on the road. In addition to the lack of clarity, the snowy ground is slippery. The alternation between snow that melts during the day and freezes at night creates icy patches that further increase the risk of slipping.\nSlowed down road traffic\nThe longer the snowfall continues, the more obstacles there will be on the roads. The accumulation of snowdrifts and other snow piles makes driving difficult and dangerous. As a result, snow-covered roads may be subject to temporary closures or detours, in particular so that professionals can carry out snow removal operations.\nIf the snow-covered roads remain open despite the weather conditions, traffic will be severely disrupted and slowed down. Speed limits, traffic restrictions, accidents and traffic jams are sure to be there.\nMechanical damage to vehicles\nIn addition, snowfall also causes mechanical damage to vehicles. This is because snow seeps in and very low temperatures affect their proper functioning on several levels: batteries weaken, tires deflate, brakes get damaged and coolants freeze.\nIncreased risk of accidents\nFor all these reasons, snowfall and snow-covered roads significantly increase the risk of road accidents. The road authorities are in charge of snow removal and the good condition of the roads. However, these operations are complicated when snow falls unpredictably.\nDriving safely To minimize the danger, it is necessary to adopt careful driving. First, by reducing speed, anticipating stops, avoiding sudden movements, maintaining safety distances and using lights. You can turn on the low beam headlights even during the day to improve visibility or the fog lights.\nTo improve grip on snow and ice, winter tires or chains are highly recommended. Tires should always be in good condition and properly inflated.\nFinally, each vehicle must be equipped with a winter emergency kit. This can contain blankets, warm clothes, food supplies, a shovel, jumper cables, etc.\nPublic transport disrupted Snowfall also impacts public transport, in a variable way depending on the type of vehicle.\nBuses\nBuses face the same challenges as cars in snow: lack of visibility, difficult driving, increased risk of slipping, and mechanical problems. While waiting for more favourable weather conditions and snow removal operations, roads may close. If the lanes remain accessible, traffic disruptions are to be feared with traffic blockages and also accidents.\nTrains\nUnderground trains such as subways are less affected, as they are not directly exposed to snowfall and run on fixed rails.\nLong-distance outer trains are minimally impacted, as they run on fixed railway tracks that provide good grip and reduce the risk of skidding. Railways are often better maintained than roads with de-icing and snow removal devices managed by railway companies. Unlike roads where snow can accumulate, railway tracks are designed to minimize snow accumulations. In addition, trains can crush snow on the tracks as they pass. Finally, they are heavier and therefore more stable transports, unlike smaller vehicles which are more likely to slip, because they are lighter.\nAirplanes\nThe plane moves between heaven and earth. In order to avoid skidding, runways must be completely de-iced and clear for safe take-off and landing. However, snow can accumulate on aircraft surfaces, such as wings or control surfaces, and affect lift, stability, and aerodynamics.\nIn addition to regular inspections, aircraft are subject to other special checks in the winter. Pilots must follow specific procedures in case of snowfall and complicated weather conditions. For obvious safety reasons, flights may be cancelled.\nDaily life turned upside down Since roads are difficult to navigate and to prevent accidents, schools and businesses may close. Deliveries of goods and supplies are also slowed down or stopped. Daily life can be disrupted by electricity, gas, heating and water cuts.\nFinally, snowfall also impacts pedestrians. Indeed, walking on snowy and/or icy sidewalks is a delicate exercise with risks of falls and injuries.\nIncreased avalanche risk In addition to the impact of snowfall on transport, roads and people's daily lives, the risk of avalanches on people and infrastructure cannot be excluded.\nWind Plate Formation\nAn avalanche is formed when snow accumulates on a slope. The fresh snow adds to an already existing layer and increases the weight on the slope, producing the avalanche. In the mountains, the direction of the wind can deposit snow on the windy side of a ridge or ledge, forming wind slabs.\nThese plates are unstable and easily detached. Just an extra weight can cause the slab to break down and trigger an avalanche. When a slab of wind breaks off, it can quickly spread down the slope, taking the surrounding snow with it. This rapid spread can increase the size and power of the avalanche.\nRisks to human life and the economy\nThe risks to the population are therefore real since avalanches can cause loss of life. People caught in an avalanche can be injured or, in the worst case, die.\nSnow avalanches can damage or destroy everything in their path: entire lots, roads, bridges, buildings, vegetation, etc. This results in significant financial damage to homeowners and utilities. Rebuilding infrastructure after an avalanche can be time-consuming and costly. Not to mention that there are often impacts on economic activities such as tourism or agriculture.\nRead also\"An avalanche can bury a person like a village\": a rescuer recounts his missions\nAccess to some populated areas may be blocked, isolating populations and making it difficult to deliver emergency aid, medical supplies and other relief. Apart from the material aspect, psychological sequelae are sometimes observed after such meteorological phenomena.\nFaced with the seriousness of the consequences of snowfall or avalanches, preventive measures are essential. Early warning systems, contingency plans, weather monitoring and public awareness are essential elements to best manage extreme situations and try to minimize the damage.",
