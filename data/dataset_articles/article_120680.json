  "text": "Did you see it? Incredible sunrise, double rainbow dazzles Cincinnati sky An incredible sunrise dazzled the sky over Cincinnati on Friday, complete with a double rainbow. The orange-colored sky glowed over the city in a rare but stunning display. The morning rain gave an added boost of a double rainbow in addition to the sunrise. Unfortunately, the sunrise might be the only good thing about Friday's forecast. Friday's rain arrived during the end of the morning rush, with winds picking up to 45-50 mph gusts into the afternoon and evening. We could see another 1-2\" of rain in combo with the winds that could lead to power interruptions. Strong winds linger into early Saturday. Cold air takes hold Saturday and into Sunday. Sunday's temperatures may not make it out of the teens! This will be the beginning of a harsh stretch of winter weather that could last into next week. On MLK Day Monday, the wind chills in the morning will be at or below zero. Plan on some light snow showers. Right now the bigger system bringing snow stays to our south. We'll be monitoring for any shift.",
