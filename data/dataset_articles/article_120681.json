  "text": "Got a phone call Monday afternoon that my local school district was cancelling school Tuesday due to forecast snow. Fine, I think they should have waited as it's not uncommon for storm tracks to shift and miss us entirely. Woke up Tuesday morning and there was a half inch, this is Wisconsin, not Texas, a half inch of snow does not require school cancellation. Went out at 1445 when school would have gotten out. Bare pavement and an additional half inch on the grassy areas, why did we cancel school again? Snow picked up in the evening and we ended up with about 4 inches on the roads, 6 on the grass.\nNow the school district is hesitant after all the harassment they took on Tuesday. They waited until 5am to cancel today, hours after a Blizzard Warning was issued. My 2pm we are supposed to be in full on Blizzard conditions, snow of 1 inch per hour for three hours and 50 MPH winds. Supposed to be a foot of snow by noon tomorrow.\nI'm very thankful that I have a job that lets me work from home when necessary. I'd be out two days of vacation if I still drove a forklift for a living.",
