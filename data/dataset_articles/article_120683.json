  "text": "It’s fair to say that keeping on top of the laundry pile is no one’s idea of fun. Particularly while the weather’s as cold and wet as it is. Hanging washing outside is generally a no-go during the winter months, which makes the process more of a hassle than it needs to be, as we all know hanging garments up in chilly rooms can mean they take yonks to dry. Enter, heated clothes airers . These handy home appliances provide a compromise between draping wet garments over radiators and using a tumble dryer when you want to speed up laundry drying times. Tumble dryers can be expensive to run, which typically makes heated clothes airers a more energy-efficient option to invest in, while energy prices aren’t far from many of our minds. The Dry:Soon drying pod features in our review of the best heated clothes airers and it impressed our testers when it came to super-fast drying times. Our writer noted that T-shirts and cotton shirts were dry in the space of an hour, while thicker fabrics were “mostly dry in two hours”. Better still, the appliance is reduced by 30 per cent, which has brought the price down to less than £70, the same price as during the Black Friday sales. Keep reading for all the details on this money-saving home appliance deal. Looking for an energy-efficient way to tackle your laundry this winter?
