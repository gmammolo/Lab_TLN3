  "text": "*Originally published on March 6, 2020: If you just aren't familiar with preparing your home or apartment for winter, listen up! Homeowners and apartment dwellers, we've got some top tips to help you keep your water pipes from freezing and, ultimately, avoid a costly plumbing repair! When water freezes, it expands, and that can cause your water pipes to expand and burst—even if they're plastic. The trick is to identify trouble areas first. The pipes that are most prone to freezing include exposed pipes in unheated areas of the home (i.e., the garage, any plumbing that's located on the exterior of the home, and pipes located in poorly insulated exterior walls). This includes your [garden hose spigot](https://amzn.to/3zEIxUt)! Insulating pipes is usually an effective and low-cost option. Your local hardware store should be able to point you in the right direction. Also, you can purchase a [faucet insulator](https://amzn.to/3NEyFC5) for your outdoor spigot—it's a few dollars but well worth the extra protection. You should also turn your outdoor water off, open your spigot to let the remaining water drain out, and have your sprinklers blown out. As for the pipes inside your home ... - Keep your [thermostat](https://amzn.to/31wavoI)at 55 degrees or higher to prevent freezing, and keep it on both night and day. - Leave cabinets open to allow warmer air to reach the piping under sinks. - Let your [faucets](https://amzn.to/3HAEVoZ)drip, as that will help prevent freezing. If you're really unsure about your current plumbing situation, it's always wise to have a plumber come check things out. *This post may contain affiliate links, at no additional cost to you, and OurCommunityNow.com may earn a small commission.",
