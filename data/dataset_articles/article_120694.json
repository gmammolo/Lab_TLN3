  "text": "ST. LOUIS — Just in time for the St. Louis area’s first brush with dangerously cold temperatures, [HeatUpStLouis.org](https://heatupstlouis.org/) is launching its annual campaign to help pay for home heating. It’s called Rise and Shine for Heat, in partnership with Hardee’s. The kick-off was Thursday at Commerce Bank in Clayton. This marks the 24th year. HeatUpStLouis.org is asking for volunteer groups on Feb. 9 to sign-up to greet people at participating Hardee’s restaurants to solicit donations. HeatUp is also taking advance orders for biscuits at HeatUpStLouis.org. The annual effort’s slogan is “Have a heart. Heat a home.” Founder Gentry Trotter was asked about donations. “It’s been off pretty bad,” Trotter said. “It’s down by 38% or more. Our little money, unlike other big charities, the money we get from all of these people, 100% of it goes directly to helping somebody. There is no administrative fee because our board members underwrite our administrative costs.” St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson was there on behalf of the St. Louis Fire Chief’s Association. Jenkerson said every year, fire officials see death and destruction caused by the improper use of space heaters. “You know, people look for alternative sources of heat,” the chief said. “They are trying to reduce their overall heating bill. Space heaters are the bane of any fire department.” The HeatUpStLouis.org Hardee’s Rise and Shine event takes place Feb. 9 at all St. Louis area Hardee’s in Missouri and Illinois from 6-10:30 a.m. Rev. Earl E. Nance is HeatUpStLouis.org Corporate Treasurer. “You have seniors making decisions between heating and eating,” said Nance. “With this cold and inclement weather coming in, it is important for us to check on our neighbors. HeatUpStLouis.org Board President Ben Turec said, “We always need volunteers, and you can actually go to [HeatUpStLouis.org](https://heatupstlouis.org/) now and order biscuits for $1. You get your choice of egg or sausage biscuits. You can order 20 or more; they’re a dollar each and everything goes to HeatUpStLouis.org.” Ameren Vice President of Energy Solutions and Business Development Tara Oglesby said, “Ameren works with organizations like HeatUpStLouis.org to make sure that when there are people who can’t pay their bills, they have resources.” Trotter said HeatUpStLouis.org is in its 24th year of the Rise and Shine partnership with Hardee’s. On its website, the organization is signing up volunteers for the event. Volunteers will work one-hour shifts greeting guests in the restaurant or drive-thru, encouraging them to give extra to HeatUpStLouis.org. “So, please, give us a dollar,” Turek said. “Twenty, if you can. And if you’re in trouble, and you’re getting your energy source turned off, please go to heatupstlouis.org and let us know. It’s really easy. We can help.” To watch 5 or reports 24/7, 5 On Your Side is always streaming on 5+.
