  "text": "Last Updated Jetting off to a warm, relaxing getaway in the middle of winter doesn’t always mean having to go somewhere remote where flight prices alone can set you back thousands of dollars. Even now that temperatures across the country are dropping like never before, there’s no shortage of gorgeous sunny destinations to explore right here in the U.S., and that’s exactly what [Kayak’s](https://www.kayak.com/news/warm-places-to-visit-in-february/) ranking of “Top Warm Places To Visit In February” just confirmed. The list, compiled based on the company’s independently collected data, featured three stunning domestic destinations, perfect for those looking to escape the winter blues without having to book an expensive international flight. Fort Lauderdale, Florida With average February temperatures of 69°F (20.5°C) and an impressive 12 hours of daylight, [Fort Lauderdale, Florida](https://www.traveloffpath.com/top-3-u-s-beach-destinations-for-an-affordable-winter-getaway/) remains one of America’s favorite beachy destinations year-round. People have always flocked to the city for its sun-soaked beaches and electrifying atmosphere, but its reputation as a party hotspot more popular among spring breakers has always held the Floridian hub back a bit in terms of its tourism success. Now, though, travelers seem to be rediscovering Fort Lauderdale as a well-rounded destination suited to virtually every type of traveler, from college kids just looking to have fun to families seeking some well-deserved relaxation. Often called the “Venice of America,” Fort Lauderdale boasts an impressive canal network, which visitors can explore firsthand through organized boat tours that start at $38 per adult. If taking in the views of the golden-sanded beaches from afar isn’t enough to get you out of that wintery mindset, take the time to actually lounge around the iconic Fort Lauderdale Beach, lined with palm trees and trendy cafes that make that mid-day snack feel like the escape you’ve been pining after for so long. Beyond its breathtaking views, the city is home to more art galleries, museums, and theaters than you can count, and the ultimate playground for those of you looking to experience the city’s underrated culture once the sun sets. Las Olas Boulevard, lined with boutiques, art galleries, and high-end restaurants, adds that final touch of classic city charm to the overall experience. O’ahu, Hawaii Home to crystal-clear waters, pristine sands, and what many would consider to be the quintessential island culture, the 50th U.S. state makes its (expected) appearance in yet another “Best Warm North American Destinations” list. This time, Hawaii’s proud representative is O’ahu, an island famous for its other-worldly views and postcard-looking beaches, of which Waikiki is arguably the most famous. Between the white-sanded shores, deep green rainforests, and volcanic craters, O’ahu presents such a diverse array of landscapes that you’re bound to feel a little overwhelmed. Those who don’t want to sit around and take in the pretty views all day will have a lot to do, too. Surfing enthusiasts can catch waves in the birthplace of modern surfing, while those seeking some good ol’ relaxation can bask in the warmth of the tropical sun. If you’re more of a history buff, you’ll get the chance to interact firsthand with the region’s storied past. Here, you can visit Pearl Harbor and pay homage to the events of December 7, 1941, explore the Polynesian Cultural Center, or make the (very worthwhile) trip to the stunning Byodo-In Temple. Whatever’s on your itinerary, one thing’s for sure – the warm weather with temperatures that average 70°F (21°C) throughout February is sure to make an already-great vacation that much better. Tucson, Arizona While not your typical beachy getaway, Tucson, Arizona offers the type of mild climate and jaw-dropping views that most of us are seeking this winter. Average daytime temperatures here tend to stay on the lower end of what you’d consider “warm,” ranging from 60-70°F (15-21°C); however, considering that rainfall is minimal to non-existent and that you’re not planning on swimming or sunbathing either way, that’s pretty much perfect. Thanks to its location in the famous Sonoran Desert, Tucson in February becomes the perfect place for you to explore the sandy landscapes without having to fight the scorching summer heat. With gorgeous, wild attractions like the Saguaro National Park and the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, the city’s surroundings are the ultimate playground for outdoor enthusiasts. On the other hand, city trippers will have the time of their lives exploring Tucson’s many cultural attractions, including (but not limited to) Mission San Xavier del Bac, the Old Tucson Studios, and the Tucson Museum of Art and Historic Block.
