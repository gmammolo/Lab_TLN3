  "text": "Explainer: How to be prepared for winter weather hazards\nWinter can be a fun and enjoyable time of year with the snow and cold temperatures, but there are also dangers that exist if you are not careful.\nOne of the hazards central Iowa has seen in the past is called a \"snow squall.\" These snow squalls are sudden bursts of intense snow and winds that can lead to whiteouts and very dangerous driving conditions. Unlike blizzards, snow squalls are shorter in duration (less than two hours), but it only takes a short amount of time for conditions to get out of hand.\nIn October 2020, a snow squall produced a localized swath of 6-9 inches of snow over northern portions of the Des Moines metro area, leading to dangerous travel conditions and reduced visibility.\nIn Pennsylvania, a deadly 80-car pileup happened during a snow squall in late March 2022. Commuters should always be alert to rapidly changing weather conditions and avoid traveling if possible during a snow squall warning.\nObviously, life can’t come to halt every time there is winter weather, but there are some practical driving and care maintenance tips you can practice:\n- Check your tires for adequate tread and plenty of air.\n- Make sure your vehicle has plenty of fluids, a strong battery and your oil is changed.\n- Remove snow and ice from your vehicle.\n- If skidding, avoid accelerating and braking too hard. Turn in the direction of the skid to regain control.\n- Always drive slowly and carefully on snow/ice-covered roads.\nSnow and ice aren’t the only danger, but extreme temperatures can lead to health problems and even death if you’re not careful.\nThe wind chill or “feels like” temperature describes how you perceive temperature when it’s very windy. Wind speeds up heat loss from your body by removing the insulating layer of heat, thereby making you feel colder than the actual air temperature. When wind chills drop below -20 degrees, this can lead to frostbite on exposed skin in 30 minutes, and when wind chills are colder than -35 degrees, frostbite can occur in under 10 minutes. During periods of extreme cold you can practice the following tips to keep yourself safe and healthy:\n- Limit time outdoors\n- Cover exposed skin\n- Bring pets indoors\n- Make sure you have a travel safety kit with food and supplies\n- Check on vulnerable family and friends.\nHere at KCCI Storm Team 8, we will alert you to changing weather conditions, and we hope everyone has a safe and enjoyable winter.\nMore winter storm coverage\nInteractive Radar| Weather Alerts| Traffic See which school districts are closed here Here's how to accurately measure snowfall Why to put a quarter on a frozen cup of water before losing power and more outage tips 8 snowstorm reminders your mom would want you to know Here’s how to make sure your phone provides severe weather alerts Explainer: How to be prepared for winter weather hazards Tips for keeping your house safe and warm during the cold weather",
