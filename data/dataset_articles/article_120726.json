  "text": "As the sun rose over the hills of Cincinnati and the eastern sky brightened through all shades of pink and orange, early Friday risers witnessed a double rainbow appear out of the western mists . I'm dubbing it the \"double rainbow at dawn.\" Although rainbows happen several times a year, this one was unique in timing, altitude and brilliance.\nRainbow spotting basics Rainbows are caused by sunlight bending and bouncing off water particles in the atmosphere. That light then forms a multi-colored rainbow that can stretch over about 1/4 of the sky, with the reds at the top and the violets at the bottom.\nWhat makes rainbows such a rare sight is that you must be in the right place under just the right conditions to see that colorful arc of light. Rainbows appear on the opposite side of the sky from the sun and are much easier to notice when the sky behind it is dark. It is not very often that it rains while the sun is shining, but that is what you need – the perfect combination of sunlight, darkness and water.\nWhy this double rainbow was so unique Especially bright and dazzling rainbows sport a second, fainter arc of light above the main bow. These double rainbows are much rarer with the second arc usually about 10-13 degrees higher than the primary one. The colors of the second bow are reversed – the reds are on the inside of the arc while the violets are on the outside.\nThe height of the rainbow depends on the altitude of the sun. The higher the sun is in the sky, the lower the rainbow. In fact, when the sun is more than halfway up in the sky, you can never see a rainbow from the ground.\nWhat made the rainbow Friday morning in Cincinnati so special is that it started to appear before the sun rose. The sun was lighting up the water molecules in the upper atmosphere before brightening the landscape. This not only made the background of the rainbow much darker than normal, but it also made the rainbow arc higher in the sky. In fact, this rainbow was about the highest rainbow you can ever see from Earth.\nA rainbow can actually form into a full circle of light, but the ground so often blocks the bottom half. If you are viewing from a mountaintop, you can sometimes see more than a semicircle as it arcs into valleys or canyons. And if you were flying in a plane while a rainbow was occurring, you could observe even more of the full, colorful circle.\nLight in the darkness Friday's rainbow glowed for just a few minutes before fading into the January gloom. As the dark and cloudy winter months continue, hopefully the double rainbow at dawn brightened up your entire day.\nDean Regas is an astronomer and author of six books including \"1000 Facts About Space\" and \"How to Teach Grown-Ups About Pluto\" and host of the popular astronomy podcast \"Looking Up with Dean Regas.\" He can be reached at www.astrodean.com .\nSign up for online astronomy classes What: Get Ready for the eclipse. A total solar eclipse is coming on April 8. Get ready for the greatest show in the universe. Astronomer Dean Regas will tell you what’s going to happen, when it will strike, where you need to go and how you can see and photograph it all.\nWhen: Feb. 6 at 7 p.m.\nTickets: $10 per household\nInformation: Join the live class or get the recording to watch later at your convenience Register in advance at astrodean.com/shop .",
