  "text": "Tips to keep your pipes from freezing as temperatures drop ST. LOUIS, Mo. (First Alert 4) - With an extended period of freezing weather across the bistate, there is the threat for freezing pipes in your homes and businesses. Missouri American Water recommends: if possible, eliminate sources of cold air new water pipes. Be prepared: - Know the location of your main water shut-off valve. - Turn off and drain your irrigation system. - Eliminate sources of cold air near water. - Protect exposed pipes by wrapping them with insulation, fabric, or newspaper When temperatures stay below freezing: - Leave doors open on cabinets and vanities to expose pipes to warmer air. - Keep water moving through pipes by allowing a small trickle of water to run. - If it snows, allow the snow to cover your water meter. Snow acts as insulation. “I know a lot of times customers their pipes will freeze and they want to check their water meter,” Senior Communications Manager Christie Barnhart shared. “We really advise against that. the meter is in the ground, its insulated so if you pop open that meter lid you could expose that meter to cold air and create even more issues.” If your pipes freeze: - Shut off the water immediately. - Thaw pipes with warm air, not direct heat. Avoid leaving space heaters unattended and avoid the use of kerosene heaters or open flames. - Turn the water back on slowly once pipes have thawed, and check for cracks and leaks. Missouri American Water said following these simple tips can protect plumbing and prevent costly repairs and higher water bills. Copyright 2024 KMOV. All rights reserved.",
