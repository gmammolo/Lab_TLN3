  "text": "Stay warm and safe with these winter weather tips from MFD MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - With winter weather on the horizon, we know a lot of you are making sure you and your loved ones stay warm. And the Memphis Fire Department wants to make sure you stay safe while heating up. Space Heaters For space heaters, give them space. Have at least three feet of free space around it, and keep it away from pets and kids who may knock it over. Make sure you have a working smoke alarm just in case. Generators If your home loses power and you decide to use a gas-powered generator, keep the generator outside. Never use a gas-powered generator inside your home. Don’t even have it inside your garage, because you risk inhaling carbon monoxide, which is very dangerous. You cannot see it and you cannot smell it. By the time you notice that it’s inside your home, it’s too late. Electric power stations, on the other hand, work very similarly to gas-powered generators but are safe for indoor use. Warming Centers There will be warming centers open for those in need of shelter from the cold. MFD and the City of Memphis will post alerts with winter weather resources on their social media platforms. Smoke Alarms The Memphis Fire Department also says you may qualify for a free smoke alarm installed by a Memphis firefighter. You qualify for a free smoke alarm if you meet the following conditions. - You live in the City of Memphis and own the property in which you reside and - You do not already have a working smoke alarm and are not financially able to purchase a smoke alarm. Regardless of these conditions, you may qualify, if: - At least one child under the age of 18 resides with you or - You are 60 years of age or older. To request a smoke alarm, please complete the [ smoke alarm request form ](https://memphisold.memphistn.gov/government/fire-department/free-smoke-alarm-application/)on the City of Memphis’ website.
