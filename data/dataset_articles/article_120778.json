  "text": "Eric Stone/Houston Public Media The 2019 Houston Marathon finish line The Arctic front coming to Houston will create optimal running weather for the Chevron Houston Marathon on Sunday.\nThe marathon usually sees around 300,000 participants, volunteers, and spectators on race day. Runners say Houston's marathon is one of the best because of its ideal conditions.\n\"It's flat, it's hard, the weather's right,\" Marathon runner Patrick Tiernan said. \"I've heard great things.\nTiernan has represented Australia in several international competitions, including the 2020 and 2016 Olympics. He and others come from around the world to participate in Houston's marathon.\nLars Thestrup is the Medical Director for the Houston Marathon. He said temperatures are expected to be around the mid-40s throughout the race.\n“The optimal weather for a marathon is between 40 and 65 degrees. So as of right now, we have a green flag race and I'm really excited about it,\" Thestrup said.\nHe said runners should keep their layers on and take them off as they warm up throughout the marathon, but keep them on hand in case the wind cools them off again.\nFor spectators, it's a different story.\n\"As spectators, it's gonna be cold,\" Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Peña said. \"… and even though it's cold, we recommend that you hydrate appropriately. It's gonna be a long day and we wanna ensure that you're properly hydrated.\"\nPeña also recommended that attendees arrive early and consider using public transportation because some roads will be closed for the marathon.\nThe race will start Sunday at 7:01 a.m., and festivities will continue until the early afternoon.",
