Friday morning, one of its bus drivers, Deneen Tate, got out of her bus to help a person who lost control of his car and ended up in a snowbank. When the bus driver saw the car struggling, she pulled over near his car at Old Orchard and Boundary to help out. Together, they rocked the car back and forth and got it on the road. Tate waited to make sure the driver made it out okay, yelling, \"drive safely\" as he drove away. The driver of the stuck car got in touch with MCTS, saying, \"God bless her.\"",
