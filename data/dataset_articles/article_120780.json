  "text": "‘Astronomical’ warming in Nunavut forecasts temperatures above zero next week\nWarm winds pushing up from the south will bring unseasonably warm readings in parts of the territory\nWhile many other places across the North shiver in the cold, unusually warm weather is in the forecast for much of Nunavut through the weekend and into early next week.\nWarm winds pushing up from the south are expected to bring temperatures to above zero in some parts of Nunavut, and Iqaluit is expected to reach a high of 4 C on Monday, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.\nHigh winds, reduced visibility and unsafe road conditions were expected Friday night, according to the City of Iqaluit, which issued a warning to residents to stay indoors.\n“If we’re looking at what our normal temperatures would be on Monday, that’s maybe 30 degrees above normal,” said Jesse Wagar, a warning preparedness meteorologist with the federal government’s environmental department.\n“That is just an astronomical amount of warming that this weather system is pushing towards the North.”\nBy Thursday, the forecast in Iqaluit drops to -13 C, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada.\nBut while Nunavut basks in the relative warmth, western areas like the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and Alberta are dealing with extreme cold temperatures and severe weather warnings.\nIn some parts of Alberta, an Arctic blast coming from the North may cause temperatures to feel as low as -50 C.\n“These sorts of highly amplified flow patterns, we do see them often enough that they’re pretty normal to see through the winter,” Wagar said.\n“But the extent of this one, like how cold it has been through the Northwest Territories and Alberta, and how warm it’s going to be in southeastern Nunavut and Nunavik, is unusual.\n“Some of the temperatures we’re seeing in Alberta are the coldest since the ’70s. This is not normal.”\nWagar says it’s difficult to attribute this weather event to climate change, but notes climate change is bringing more frequent and extreme weather events.\nThe warm temperatures carry a chance of rain in Nunavik, and federal government is recommending Nunavimmiut exercise caution for dangerous icy conditions early next week.",
