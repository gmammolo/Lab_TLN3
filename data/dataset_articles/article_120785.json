The units that heat homes can cost thousands of dollars, but a few simple steps could help homeowners save big. The units that heat homes can cost thousands of dollars, but a few simple steps could help homeowners save big. As Oklahomans prepare for winter weather to hit the state, one of the most important parts of that preparation is making sure the heater stays on. The units that heat homes can cost thousands of dollars, but a few simple steps could save homeowners big. [| MORE | OKC plans to treat snow routes in preparation for winter weather](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-okc-snow-routes-treat-roads-winter-weather/46367121) \"As you can imagine, with the temperatures being what they are, your unit is going to run quite a bit this weekend and as we go through the first part of next week,\" said Aaron McReynolds, a comfort consultant with Drabek and Hill Air Conditioning and Heating. While experts suggest a check-up on units twice a year, HVAC Repair Services understands the challenges that weather events, like the arctic blast coming to Oklahoma, can bring. Changing air filters and making sure those vents are open should keep the heat in homes. \"Either your gas heater or electric heater are going to be running 24/7 almost, so it is very important that that system be able to breathe. You want to make sure those filters are changed and not clogged up,\" McReynolds said. >> [Check live radar](https://www.koco.com/weather/radar) | [KOCO weather page](https://www.koco.com/weather) | [Get KOCO on the Go](https://www.koco.com/article/get-koco-news-on-the-go-download/44041628) Those who have trouble over the weekend may not be able to get their unit fixed until Tuesday. \"On a Sunday, is if they need parts and we don't have the part available, then obviously no wholesale houses to get that part, so it may be a thing that we have to wait,\" McReynolds said. \"Then Monday being a holiday, that makes it even worse. You might have to wait till Tuesday to find a part.\" Oklahomans should also check where to turn off their water in case a homeowner's pipes freeze. Knowing where that is can make the difference between having a quick leak or flooding the house.
