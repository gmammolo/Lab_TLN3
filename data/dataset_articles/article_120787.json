  "text": "(Guthrie Center, IA) – The ACGC Chargers are off to a great start after the break as they beat Exira-EHK last week 65-62 in a very close competition with some clutch plays late in the game. With that performance, it showed that ACGC can take care of the basketball and hunker down when the game is on the line. ACGC has moved up to #5 in Class 1A in this week’s IHSAA boy’s basketball rankings, even with one of the toughest schedules in Class 1A. The Chargers currently sit at 8-2 on the season while sitting at 5-2 in the West Central Conference. In terms of improvements this season, ACGC has been looking to improve on the offensive end, especially when it comes to attacking a zone defense. The Chargers are almost a bit too reluctant to take the open looks when it comes to a zone defense, which isn’t always a bad thing, but there could be better looks down the line. Head Coach Lance Kading is hoping his boys can be more patient when it comes to attacking the zone. With today’s postponement of their game against #4 Earlham, the Chargers are looking at next week when they take on the CAM Cougars. ACGC leads the series 4-2 as they’ve won the last four games, but with the even-scoring offense of the Cougars, it could be a tough challenge for this ACGC team. ACGC will host CAM at ACGC Junior High School this Monday in a game that will be broadcast on KSOM 96.5 and Western Iowa Today TV. The pregame show will start after the girl’s postgame show, around 7:15 p.m. for a 7:30 p.m. tipoff. (Click below to listen to this article)",
