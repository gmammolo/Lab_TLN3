  "text": "The city of Denver will keep its cold weather shelters open 24 hours a day over the long holiday weekend to protect people from dangerous conditions amid a blast of arctic air that is expected to grip the eastern part of the state through Tuesday.\nThe city’s announcement comes after Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster declaration on Thursday mobilizing the Colorado National Guard to assist communities with keeping their residents safe.\nThe state is keeping a running list of shelters and other warming center resources available on its Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management website at dhsem.colorado.gov .\n“No one should freeze to death in our state for lack of shelter,” Polis said in a statement Thursday.\nThe National Weather Service has issued a wind chill warning for the metro area and other eastern Colorado counties starting Friday night and stretching into Tuesday. In Denver, that warning will coincide with chances of snow starting Friday evening and running through Monday night.\nWindchill could drop as low as -20 degrees in the city over the weekend. Across the eastern half of the state, some areas could see windchill as low as -35 degrees, according to the Weather Service.\n“Frostbite and hypothermia will be possible for anyone exposed to the elements,” Weather Service officials said in a hazardous weather advisory. “It is important to dress appropriately with multiple layers of clothing, hat, and mittens if you do venture out.”\nFor Denver, the blast of dangerous cold comes as Mayor Mike Johnston’s administration has filled converted hotels and other forms of shelter with people who are homeless and migrants who have arrived in the city from the southern border in recent months. Now some of those hotels will be part of an emergency cold weather response as well.\nPeople seeking shelter in Denver are urged to go to the city’s “front door” access points to receive help. For single men, that is the Lawrence Street Community Center at 2222 Lawrence St. For women, that is the Samaritan House at 2301 Lawrence St. And for young people between the ages of 15 and 20 years old, that is Urban Peak at 2100 Stout St., according to the city.\nFamilies in need should call the city’s Connection Center at 303-295-3366, city spokeswoman Derek Woodbury said.\nThe city’s emergency warming shelters at a former DoubleTree Hotel at 4040 Quebec St. and a former Best Western Hotel at 4595 Quebec St. will open at 7 p.m. Friday and remain open until at least 10 a.m. Tuesday, according to the city’s update.\nRelated Articles Colorado News | Arctic cold blast sets in Friday, with wind chills of -30 degrees possible through Tuesday Colorado News | More than 600 flights delayed, canceled at Denver International Airport Colorado News | Denver City Council poised to limit camping ban enforcement in freezing weather Daytime warming space will be available at all open city recreation centers during their regular business hours over the weekend. Libraries will also serve that purpose, according to Friday’s announcement.\nAll city offices and facilities are scheduled to be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, but the Glenarm Recreation Center at 2800 Glenarm Place will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. specifically as a warming shelter, city officials said.\nThe city may extend emergency resources on Tuesday depending on the weather conditions. More information is available at denvergov.org/findshelter .\nThe Denver City Council on Tuesday night is scheduled to vote on a bill that would ban Denver police and other agencies from taking away a homeless person’s tent or other shelter if temperatures are at or below 32 degrees.\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.\n Policies Report an Error Contact Us Submit a News Tip Keeler: More What’s that smell?
