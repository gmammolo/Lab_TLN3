  "text": "Bethany House offers warm shelter ahead of cold front LAREDO, TX. (KGNS) - Bethany House of Laredo is stepping up to ensure that individuals living on the streets have a place to escape the harsh elements. Representatives with the shelter say they are prepared for any potential overflow, particularly for emergency shelter services, catering to both adult men and women. Bethany Houses Outreach Specialist Esmeralda Rendon said they are getting the van ready to go up and down Laredo’s streets, distributing essential items such as coats, jackets, scarves, and encouraging individuals to seek refuge at Bethany House. “The majority of our population has substance abuse problems and mental problems so those are really hard cases,” said Rendon. “If they don’t’ want to come, I go to them and make sure they have blankets, food, and hygiene events to cover these weathers.” If you want to lend a hand, Bethany House is open for donations. They are located at 817 Hidalgo St, Laredo, TX 78040. If you would like to get in touch with them, call (956) 722-4152. For more headlines. click [here](https://www.kgns.tv/news/local).
