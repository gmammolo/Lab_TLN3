  "text": "...Extended Arctic Cold Snap Coming.... Arctic air will soon begin spreading into the region as we head into the holiday weekend. This will eventually help change rain over to some brief light snow in some places just before it ends, and it will offer sub freezing air for any moisture that lingers despite the wind's drying effect. We'll soon begin this weekend a stretch that will run the bulk of the new week with air temperatures remaining below the freezing mark, even for daytime highs. Our coldest nights will see lows in the single digits, maybe even near zero, not to mention the potential for negative wind chills. This extended cold snap will be dangerous to those without adequate shelter and will likely challenge plumbing and other cold-sensitive infrastructure. Such a long period below freezing only occurs about 3 to 4 times every 30 to 40 years in this region. Take necessary action to protect yourself and winterize property. While accumulating snow remains a possibility from late Sunday into Monday, forecast amounts have been trending lower. We'll have to wait a little while longer to get more specific. ...WIND ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL MIDNIGHT CST TONIGHT... * WHAT...South to southwest winds 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 50 mph expected. * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois and southeast Missouri. * WHEN...From midnight CST tonight to midnight CST Friday night. * IMPACTS...Gusty winds will blow around unsecured objects. Wet ground may result in some trees being uprooted, and tree limbs will be blown down. Power outages are possible. High profile vehicles will have difficulty. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A corridor of stronger winds, with gusts up to 60 mph, is possible just to the east of the Advisory region. If that begins to appear likely, the advisory will be upgraded to a high wind warning. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Use extra caution when driving, especially if operating a high profile vehicle. Secure outdoor objects. && Currently in Carterville 2024 is here! With a new year comes new goals, what is your biggest goal?",
