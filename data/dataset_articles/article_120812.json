  "text": "(Shenandoah) -- Despite a raging winter storm, life--and in some cases, the beginning of life--goes on. Many KMAland residents still had to do their jobs, regardless of the heavy snow and bone-chilling winds hitting the region. That includes a Shenandoah Medical Center physician forced to use alternative transportation to get to the hospital in time to deliver a baby. Dr. Chase Brown is a family practitioner at SMC. Brown lives in a rural area several minutes away from the hospital. With heavy snowdrifts forming on secondary roads, Brown tells KMA News he rode to the hospital on an ATV in order to make the delivery in time. \"Sometimes, the best way for me to get to the hospital is on my 4-wheeler,\" said Brown. \"Knowing that the storm is coming in--I actually got stuck on Tuesday in my regular vehicle--so I felt like the safest way to get into the hospital was to bundle up. Sure enough, I definitely would've gotten stuck again had I not taken my 4-wheeler. \"I just made it in early, took my time--that was the best way to get here. But, it was definitely necessary,\" he added. Even with a 4-wheeler, Brown says maneuvering around the snow-covered roads was an adventure. \"Very high snow drifts,\" he said. \"There's a few snow drifts where it felt like there were as tall as my 4-wheeler driving in. So, I had to hit some of those at speeds so where it didn't slow me down, and didn't get stuck. Nothing where it felt like it was throwing me off the road, but there several significant snow drifts that were pretty high.\" Weather notwithstanding, Brown says it was important to arrive at SMC in time for the baby delivery. \"It's one of those scenarios where it couldn't wait,\" said Brown. \"You can't tell the mom to hold the baby in when the baby needs to come, right? We had to get this delivery done today to make sure this mom and baby were safe, happy and healthy.\" The baby arrived at around 8:30 Friday morning--both mother and infant are reported in good condition. Brown credits his partner, Dr. Martee MacLeod-Kozal and the hospital's OR staff for helping with the birth. He also thanks his neighbors for clearing a space for him to get his ATV on the road.",
