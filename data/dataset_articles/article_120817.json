  "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — With freezing temperatures on their way, it's important to keep your pets out of the elements. \"You really want to be prepared to accommodate those elements with them inside your house. The wind chills are going to be single digit, talking about having a wintery mix it's just best to have them inside even if it's temporary,\" said [Southeast Texas Humane Society](https://humanesocietyofsoutheasttexas.org/) Manager Taylor Westphal. Animal experts say if you must leave a pet outside, providing a proper shelter with hay, blankets and more to keep them warm is essential. Some dogs are built to endure freezing temperatures, while others should be kept inside. \"We had a husky named Arnold who during the last cold temps refused to come inside, so of course you are going to have dogs like that. But also, like your chiweenie needs to come inside,\" Westphal said. Some of the other local shelters, like Beaumont Animal Care are taking steps to get their dogs fostered so they can be out of the cold. It's not too late to foster a dog in need before the freezing temperatures hit. \"To get the same response and find these animals a foster. It's not a long period of time, maybe three to four days at the most. Once the freeze is over the fosters can bring them back,\" said Beaumont Animal Care Foster and Adoption Coordinator Viviana Lopez. The main push is to keep your animals safe and healthy, but also keeping an eye out for animals left outside. Knowing who to call if an animal is in danger is important. \"If you live in the city of Beaumont you can call 311, which is Beaumont Animal Care or animal control. They can issue citations,\" said Westphal.",
