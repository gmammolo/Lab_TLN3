  "text": "TYLER, Texas — An East Texas organization is stepping up to transport hospital staff and first responders to work during the arctic weather in Tyler. [East Texas Jeep Club](https://www.facebook.com/EastTexasJeepClub) leader David Featherston said the crew is preparing to transport CHRISTUS Mother Frances Hospital employees to and from work as temperatures begin to drop. \"If the bad weather event happens, we will start reaching out to people to get people traveled back and forth properly,\" Featherston said. The East Texas Jeep Club started as an opportunity for like-minded folks to have some fun on the weekends. But during the freeze of 2021, they stepped up to help the community. \"We already had a group of people who were out playing, having fun in the snow. I know of at least six that I had that were running the roads and pulling people out of ditches, and just helping the general public. And I started getting contacts from all kinds of people needing rides, and that’s how it just happened,\" Featherston said. Featherston said the organization is prepared to help the hospital staff this weekend. \"You know, if you’re going to get in touch with us needing a ride, then we just mainly need to know where you’re at, which hospital, which location you need to go to, and what time you need to arrive,\" Featherston said. \"And then we will work at getting someone scheduled to pick you up and get you to your location on time.\"",
