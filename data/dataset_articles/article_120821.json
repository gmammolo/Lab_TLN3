  "text": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- Weather has been a part of KDKA's history since the very first Pitt Parade back on January 12, 1949, when the forecast that night called for rain and sleet overnight with a low of 30 degrees.\nToday, we mark 75 years of broadcasting and First Alert Meteorologist Ron Smiley is here remembering some of the major weather disasters we've covered.\nOver the past 75 years, there have been countless weather disasters, including some pretty major ones, but perhaps none more devastating than the deadly tornado outbreak of May 31, 1985.\n19 tornadoes touched down in Western Pennsylvania that day, destroying entire towns, killing 75 people and injuring some 800 more.\nOn June 2, 1998, tornadoes cut another path of destruction across the area, touching down on Mt. Washington as our towercam caught the funnel cloud heading straight for the area.\nWe've also covered hurricanes, like in 1989 when John Shumway went to South Carolina and reported from the front lines of Hurricane Hugo.\nAnd in 2004, when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit the Pittsburgh area, leaving several towns under water.\nIn a city built on three rivers, there have been far too many floods to count over the past 75 years, including the flood of 1996.\nAnd of course, we can't talk about the weather in Pittsburgh without discussing the blizzards of 1950 and 1993, and the winter storm of 2010, which became known as 'Snowmageddon.'\nIn fact, all three of those snowstorms still stand as three of the top four largest snowstorms on record in Pittsburgh history.\nWe've clearly seen all kinds of weather events here over the past 75 years, but through it all, our top priority has been to keep you informed and safe, something we take seriously and never take for granted.\nMore from CBS News 75 years of KDKA-TV: Highlighting some of Pittsburgh's biggest breaking news stories 75 years of KDKA-TV: Remembering decades of Pittsburgh sports championships and memories KDKA-TV celebrates 75th anniversary of broadcasting in Pittsburgh Pittsburgh Weather: Rainy and windy today. Another big winter system arrives on Saturday \"I will be happy to see Pittsburgh fans:\" Despite Pittsburgh roots, one native trades Steelers for Bills In: KDKA Pittsburgh Ron Smiley Arriving to KDKA in June 2015, Ron Smiley has been giving a local and hopefully bright outlook on the day in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania.\nTwitter Facebook Instagram",
