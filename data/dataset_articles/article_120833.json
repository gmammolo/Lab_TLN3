  "text": "ST. LOUIS — Calls rang in and drop-offs were around the clock at [Stray Rescue of St. Louis ](https://www.strayrescue.org/)as the extreme weather made its way into the St. Louis Metro on Friday. Extreme winter weather is never ideal for pets and animal rescue centers have scrambled to bring those without homes to shelter. Stray Rescue on Olive Boulevard is already inundated with animals from their normal intake so the influx of incoming dogs will challenge the space even more. Donna Lochmann, a rescuer, stocked up her truck with snacks, dry and wet food, leashes, and kennels for when calls came in. She has been involved with the center for 25 years. \"It's a love-hate relationship. You know. You hate to see the animals out in this kind of weather but love the fact that we try to help and do all we can for each and every animal,\" Lochmann said. Lochmann had rescued a group of dogs in an abandoned house, a pregnant dog, and found one hiding in a cat house. \"We definitely see more pity mixed with our organization and they're definitely a shorthaired animal so they can't withstand this. Dr. Edie Oliver, a veterinarian at Stray Rescue, explained what happens when animals are impacted by inclement weather. \"When temperatures get below zero, dogs can get frostbite in just 30 minutes. Low blood sugar. Low blood pressure. Another one people don't often think about is dehydration, their water freezes so they don't have food and water,\" Oliver said. Intake levels are already challenging Oliver and her team. \"Often we don't have space so we have puppies and adults just kind of everywhere we can put them,\" Oliver said as dogs packed the surgery room. \"Even if it's garage, a shed, something like that. If you absolutely can't, they need some form of house, straw, a blanket, to make sure that they stay dry.\" she said. “If you've got a spot on your couch or in your bed, or just inside. Absolutely. We need your help,” Lochmann added. The center has more than 400 dogs in foster care currently that need permanent homes.",
