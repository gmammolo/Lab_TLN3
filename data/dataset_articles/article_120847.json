  "text": "Rainbow arches over Tennessee home struck by lightning during Friday’s storms “Thankfully we are all ok and it’s just by the hand of God that we weren’t hurt.” NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A Gallatin couple said they were home Friday morning when their house was struck by lightning. When the fire department responded, Curtis Knowles, the homeowner, said it was the largest strike they had ever seen. That lightning strike ripped the siding on the frame of the roof off. But it’s the damage on the inside that’s going to have long-lasting effects. While pieces of siding hang by a thread, Knowles and his wife are still holding on after lightning struck their house Friday morning. “The fireman showed us where it came in the house was about one foot behind where she was sitting having a Zoom meeting,” he said. Inside, the drywall was taken out, exposing insulation. The entire home electrical system was fried and must be replaced. Knowles said once the lightning struck, it exited through the gutter on the side. “Miraculously she wasn’t hurt,” he said. “Neither of us were hurt.” Knowles said their insurance will put them in a hotel for now. But they will need to be put in a temporary long-term home at some point because rewiring an entire home is no easy feat. “Thankfully we are all ok and it’s just by the hand of God that we weren’t hurt,” he said. “And that’s what we are really thankful for, extremely blessed.” Knowles said neighbors also saw some damage. Later in the day, a rainbow arched over the home. Copyright 2024 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
