  "text": "‘We’ll be ready’: MDOT prepared for threat of icy road conditions JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - With well below-freezing temperatures and the threat of freezing rain on the horizon next week for central and northern Mississippi, driving on the road won’t be easy. Monday and Tuesday are First Alert Weather Days for the higher half of the state, which means that you need to take extra precautions if you decide to hit the road. Fortunately, the Mississippi Department of Transportation is already taking steps to make sure the roads you’ll be on are safe. “The plan is to start pretreating roads sometime tomorrow, mostly north of Highway 82, and some areas of central Mississippi just to get those roads ready and prevent any kind of icing from forming that could come our way,” said David Kenney, Spokesperson for MDOT. Although Mississippi doesn’t typically see many severe winter weather threats each year, Kenney says MDOT has invested in even more winter-ready equipment. “We feel we have increased our number of operating equipment for winter weather events. In the last two years,” said Kenney. While MDOT is taking all the necessary precautions on their end, the responsibility of driving safely on the road still comes down to you. Even with a holiday weekend ahead, Kenney advises that you don’t get on the road Monday evening if you can avoid it. “If you don’t have to get out and there is wintry precipitation falling, please stay at home. It’ll just keep you safer, and oh, keep more space for our crews who are out there working to do their thing,” said Kenney. If you do find yourself on the road Monday and Tuesday, he offered advice on what to do if you encounter icy conditions. “Don’t apply the brakes heavily if you do have to brake, apply them easily, so you don’t skid, and avoid all distractions. Put the cell phone down. No texting and driving because some of the roadways could be hazardous to drive on,” said Kenney. To make sure you’re up to date on any changes to next week’s forecast, please continue to tune in to WLBT for all the latest developments for these First Alert Weather Days.
