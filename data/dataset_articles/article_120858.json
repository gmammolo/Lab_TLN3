  "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas — [Beaumont](https://www.beaumonttexas.gov/) city leaders are working to provide a shelter to anyone who needs it as Southeast Texas braces for the winter weather. Beaumont is partnering with the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Henry's Place and Some Other Place to provide shelters so people can have protection from the dangerous temperatures coming soon. The city will also be using city buses as mobile warming shelters. City officials say that thanks to lessons learned along with coordination between the city and these organizations, they stand ready to assist those in need. \"We encourage folks who need a hot meal and a warm bed to come to our shelter on McFadden Street,\" said Commanding Officer of the Salvation Army in Jefferson County Major Ken Fagan. Major Fagan says their shelter will be ready to warm, feed and house anyone who needs it. This includes overnight as the frigid temperatures sweep in. \"We have sixty beds, but when we have the severe weather we'll open it up and we'll take as many folks as we can,\" Major Fagan said. Additionally, the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross will help staff the emergency shelters at Some Other Place and Henry's Place with volunteers. \"They kinda come in knowing the game plan and try to make it as comfortable as possible for everybody,\" said Some Other Place Executive Director Christopher Robertson. For those who don't wish to use the shelters there's a second option, according to Robertson. City buses will be operating as overnight transportation and warming stations throughout Beaumont. \"People are pretty attached to their camps, some of them. With Mayor West allowing the city buses to run as warming stations they may just end up parking them outside one of the camps if people decide to stay there,\" Robertson said. These mobile warming stations are especially helpful for those experiencing homelessness. \"We're pretty familiar with where most of the homeless stay,\" said Beaumont Mayor Roy West. \"People can stay on the bus or they can be taken to the shelter and be shuttled back and forth and there will be some of both.\" Community outreach and aiding those experiencing homelessness during the freeze is just as important as the shelters, according to West. \"This is the community helping the community,\" he said.",
