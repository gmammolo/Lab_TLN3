  "text": "Nice Holiday Weekend Ahead; Getting Ready for Bitter Cold Next Week\nDerek’s Forecast!\nCOLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - It will be a cold start heading into Saturday morning with temperatures in the 30s and the ‘feels like’ temperatures down in the 20s. We will have plenty of sunshine through the afternoon with some high, thin clouds streaming in and highs in the lower 50s. Expect similar conditions on Sunday, and then by the King Holiday we will be expecting increasing clouds and also the increasing chance at a few showers late in the day or night. More showers are possible Tuesday with the arctic cold front pushing in, and there will be some winter weather concerns to our north and west. We believe, at the moment, it will just be a rain event for our area. The big story will be the return to bitter cold air for most of next week. Highs on Wednesday will be in the 30s and lows early Wednesday morning will be down in the teens! That’s the kind of cold that will impact pipes, pets, and people, so we need to make sure we are prepared for the big cool-down on the way. We will see the colder than average weather continuing for the rest of next week, and then we will look for another chance of showers Friday with another front that will bring a reinforcing shot of cold air for next weekend. Stay tuned for the cold roller coaster ride ahead!\nCopyright 2024 WTVM. All rights reserved.",
