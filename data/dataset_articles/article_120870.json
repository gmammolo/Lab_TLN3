  "text": "MCKINNEY, Texas — The Salvation Army of McKinney has cots stacked in the gym and warm clothes and blankets packed up, ready to be used for the next several nights. The [Salvation Army](https://salvationarmyntx.org/) is one of several [warming shelters](/article/news/local/fort-worth-homeless-shelters-preparing-winter-weather/287-490faab7-ac67-41d2-a665-675aa07e22e9) in Collin County and is also one of the largest in the area. \"Because life is in danger, and they need to be protected,\" said Major Gabriel Elias with the Salvation Army. Major Elias says they had 60 people show up to the warming shelter earlier in the week when the temperatures first dipped. Organizers anticipate more people to show up this weekend into Tuesday as temperatures are [expected to plummet](/article/weather/dallas-texas-snow-forecast-arctic-blast-how-cold-timeline-fort-worth-dfw-weather/287-8bb6377d-b611-4cbb-abb7-27eb7e90d324). The vast majority of people who show up to the warming shelter are unhoused, according to Elias. \"There are some families that come. They don't have enough heaters,\" said Elias. \"I feel the pain of those people.\" Elias is doing exactly what he says he's always wanted to do: help. Now retired, he was a criminal lawyer in his home country of Mexico. He left all of it behind to offer his children opportunities in education. He's learned now that his moving to the U.S. also gave him an opportunity to help through the Salvation Army. \"I left everything so my kids [can be] university-graduated,\" Elias said. People have been slowly dropping off blankets and warm clothes at the drop-off at the McKinney location at 600 Wilson Creek Parkway. Volunteers are also staffed to help with meals and any other needs. \"We're in our nice warm beds at night, and they're cold. I just felt we've got to do something,\" said Sharon Reagan. The doors at the Salvation Army open at 7 p.m. on nights it is expected to dip below freezing. For now, there are plans to open at 7 p.m. until 8 a.m. each day for the next several days.",
