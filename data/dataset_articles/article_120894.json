  "text": "listen to this article\nNicole Stallings led the Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) in June by leading a listening tour across the state.\nThe president and CEO said he spent a lot of time with hospital leaders and legislators and found their work articulate.\n“Each CEO talked about workforce shortages, access to health care and financial feasibility,” he said.\nNow nearly six months later, Stallings said HAP will work with all parties to find a solution to the health care crisis.\n“There is a continued shortage of manpower, hence fewer beds are available,” he said.\nEmergency departments are feeling the pressure due to understaffing, lack of access to care, more patients using them and delays in discharge to other hospital departments or appropriate facilities, he said.\nDoctors and nurses are planning to retire in record numbers due to age and the liability environment in the state.\nAnd in rural communities, Stallings said, the financial challenges are “unlike any we’ve seen.”\nThey pointed to the lack of maternal health and behavioral health services.\n“A large number of people come to the emergency department and stay until they get appropriate care,” he said. “Many departments are overwhelmed.”\nAlthough the situation may seem dire, Stallings said he believes there are solutions when all parties work together.\n“I believe there will be increased partnerships between local community organizations, local government, caregivers, and health systems,” he said.\nStallings comes to HAP from the Maryland Hospital Association where she was senior vice president for government affairs and policy.\nRead Also: There is a characteristic of personality that is reflected in gifts; Here we tell you what it is\nPrior to his work at MHA, Stallings was a senior policy analyst for the Maryland Secretary of Health and chief of government relations and special projects at the Maryland Health Care Commission.\n“I bring two decades of experience to Pennsylvania,” she said, adding that the challenges here are being felt across the country.\nLooking ahead, Stallings said HAP will work to create new health care partnerships, advocate to help hospitals meet their challenges and work to grow the workforce, which he said is “certainly of paramount importance.” Is a priority.”\n“Although it is challenging and complex, I am optimistic as we continue to reinvent how care is delivered with innovative care models,” he said. “New models were tested during the height of the pandemic, and they continue to be developed and improved.”\nOnce the new models are successful, Stallings said they can be shared with other systems in Pennsylvania and regionally. And through regional cooperation, successful programs elsewhere can also be shared here.\nThe work will start with developing the workforce. Stallings said the loss is being felt across the board.\nAs physicians get older, Stallings said one thing we need to pay attention to is so-called “venue shopping.”\n“We have the worst liability environment in our country and we are a net exporter of doctors,” he said.\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court in August 2022 eliminated a rule that required liability cases to be heard in the same jurisdiction where they occurred. The change came into effect from January 1, 2023.\nStallings said that since many physicians trained in Pennsylvania have decided to leave the state, returning to “situation shopping” would create more temptation for them to leave.\n“This hurts our ability to recruit not only physicians, but nurses as well,” he said.\nAlthough nursing and allied health worker programs are growing through partnerships, many of which cover the cost of tuition, Stallings said the move is necessary to recruit and retain personnel.\nAlthough Stallings said it will take time, the programs will fill not only the nursing, physician and allied health care workforce, but support staff as well.\nOne example is the partnership with Penn State Health and HACC where Penn State covers 100% of the tuition for medical assistants and phlebotomists in exchange for one year of employment.\nAt the high school level, The MedCerts Healthcare Training Program, a partnership between Mechanicsburg-based Emerge Education, Cumberland Valley School District and UPMC, offers programs in allied health care and health IT for rising high school students through 10th grade. . UPMC offers clinics in areas including medical assistants, phlebotomists, sterile processing technicians and pharmacy technologists.\nIn the Lehigh Valley, Lehigh Career & Technical Institute, Lehigh Valley Health Network, Penn State Lehigh Valley and Lehigh Carbon Community College are partnering to offer a dual enrollment program for high school seniors interested in health care careers .\nThese are just a few, Stallings said.\nThe partnership will help care teams grow. While the registered nursing degree takes time, other certifications can be obtained more quickly, Stallings said. Those people can work alongside RNs, giving them more time to complete tasks that require their skill level.\nVirtual nursing can also help. Stallings said virtual nursing can help discharge patients in one place.\n“Nurses from other parts of the state, country or even the world can follow discharge instructions with patients, freeing up local staff,” she said.\nThe recently partially passed Nurse Licensure Compact is also helping. She said the state has allowed nurses licensed in other states to practice in Pennsylvania, which will increase the pool.\nAnother thing that would help, she said, is if work visas would be more easily available to nurses from other countries.\n“It will take years to reach this scale,” he said. “In the short term, we need to innovate so we can provide quality care during emergencies.”\nTo help hospitals’ financial viability, Stallings said policy changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement are needed. This includes things like psychotherapy, psychology and social work services and outpatient services.\n“This will keep a lot of people out of the ER,” she said.\n“We applaud the movement at the federal level to stop the Medicare cuts,” he said. “We are very focused on Medicaid and that puts financial pressure on hospitals, especially those hospitals that have a higher population on Medicaid.”\nRecognizing reimbursement is always a difficult issue, Stallings said, “This administration recognizes the need to ensure people have access to care.”\n(TagstoTranslate)Access to health care(T)Financial viability of health care systems(T)Health care(T)Hospital and HealthSystem Association of Pennsylvania(T)Nicole Stallings(T)President and CEO(T)Workforce",
