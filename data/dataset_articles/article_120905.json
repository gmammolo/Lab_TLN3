  "text": "\nWith temperatures expected to be around -20°C throughout the weekend, with the wind chill making it feel much colder, Kelowna’s Gospel Mission (KGM) is busier than normal.\nKGM’s resource development manager, Vanessa Hair says the charity has “swiftly responded” to the severe weather conditions.\n“These dangerously cold temperatures will have a significant impact on those living unsheltered in our community,” she noted.\nCapacity at Kelowna’s Bay Avenue shelter has been expanded to 65 residents, while KGM’s outreach team is working closely with community partners to distribute cold weather supplies.\nThey’re also doing their best to provide support to those sheltering outside around the city.\n“As homelessness and poverty continue to rise in Kelowna, the number of individuals at risk during this dangerous drop in temperature is higher than ever,” said Hair.\n“Therefore, we urgently request donations of essential winter items, including gloves, hand warmers, sleeping bags and tents.”\nThose items can be dropped at the following locations:\nAll donations will be distributed by KGM’s outreach team to protect unhoused Kelowna residents.\n ",
