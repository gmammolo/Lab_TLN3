  "text": "People in the United States are bracing themselves for one of the coldest winters as the Arctic blast is expected to drop temperatures to minus 30s. It’s of utmost importance to keep yourself warm and make sure the pipes in your house don’t freeze.\nTo tackle the consequences of harsh weather, a plumber on TikTok has offered some useful tips you may want to note down to be prepared.\nPlumber’s tips to prevent pipes from freezing\nLet’s start with the way to prevent water pipes in your house from freezing. The video posted on\nTikTok by Jeff Mumm Plumbing, which offers some brilliant tips, has clocked over 2.2 million views.\nAccording to Jeff, everybody in the house, be it adults or children should know how to shut the water off if a pipe breaks open. If you don’t know how to do it, then call in a plumber to show you how it’s done.\nMake sure to turn the heat up inside the house by a few degrees if you have to. All the interior doors in the house, including the bathroom, need to be kept open to allow the warm air to circulate.\nA lot of people tend to keep their kitchen cabinets shut, which must be avoided at all costs to prevent the water pipes from freezing. Even shower curtains need to be left open so that the warm air from the shower gets in.\nJeff says in worst-case scenarios, it’s better to let the water drip out of the pipe than to keep it closed as it’s harder for moving water to freeze.\nHow to fix frozen water pipes\nDespite doing the above, if you find yourself with frozen water pipes, there are a few hacks to make them work again.\nIf the water doesn’t flow when you turn on the faucet, use a blow-dryer around the pipes, in the cabinets and elsewhere, to melt the ice that’s formed inside.\nHowever, the pipes may split when you’re trying to thaw the water that’s stuck inside. Ensure the water is always turned off while fixing frozen pipes.\nBut, do remember to keep the warm air going around your house even after fixing the frozen pipe to prevent it from freezing again.",
