  "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich — Driving up and down Alpine Ave. in Walker, plow truck drivers can be seen braving the blustery winds and late nights, keeping parking lots and roads clear. To thank them [Amore Trattoria Italiana](https://www.facebook.com/AmoreTrattoriaItaliana), run by Chef Jenna Arcidiacono, opened their doors for snow plowers, power company linemen, tow truck drivers and EMT's, giving them free Lasagna Soup and bread. Chef Jenna told 13 On Your Side that while on her way to work, she noticed how bad the roads were getting, and wanted to do something nice for those keeping the streets clean and safe on the first night of Michigan's first major winter storm. When 13 On Your Side stopped by the restaurant, we weren't able to talk with any drivers because they were already back on the roads. But Chef Jenna said they served about 20 workers Friday evening. \"I just don't think they get the love that they deserve,\" said Chef Jenna. People forget that they're away from their families for very long shifts. Like I asked one of the guys, he's like probably on an 18-hour shift. I'll take a couple of hour naps and then I'll be back on the road. So I don't think people think about that.\" At 9 Friday evening, Chef Jenna and her staff put out about 30 lasagna soups in a cooler for those workers who may not have been able to get to Amore when they were open. ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.
