Four other samples containing coliform were secured from four food establishments, one from a household water dispenser and the last sample from a school.\nCases of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in the city began to spike in the middle of the Christmas and New Year holidays.\nAdditional manpower According to the mayor, he asked Health Undersecretary Eric Tayag for additional manpower to help track down possible sources of contaminated water.\nA team composed of doctors and nurses, sanitation engineers, barangay health workers and policemen had been gathering samples and information in the city’s 128 barangays.\nOn Friday morning, personnel from the City Health Services Office (CHSO) proceeded to Baguio’s only rainwater reservoir to test the quality of its supply.\nADVERTISEMENT Led by Dr. Celia Flor Brillantes, city health officer, a team gathered water samples from the Santo Tomas rain basin which supplies a section of Baguio’s population (366,358 as of the 2020 census).\nThey were accompanied by a crew from the Baguio Water District which conducted their own tests. The samples would be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Metro Manila for testing.\nAccording to the CHSO, the latest tally of people who “self-reported” their conditions through a Baguio online portal has risen to 2,764, but only 609 patients have consulted doctors.\nThe CHSO said 2,564 people had complained about diarrhea attacks, while 1,477 experienced vomiting, but most of them have recovered.\nOthers complained about nausea, abdominal cramps, fever, loss of appetite and joint pains in the course of their illnesses.\nBabies and toddlers (1-4 years old) and children between 5 and 9 years old were among those treated for diarrhea.\nSome residents who spoke to the Inquirer said they had not gone to the hospital but chose to take over-the-counter medicine and other home remedies.\n“We were good after three days,” said a teacher.\nThe latest CHSO report said 294 of those who suffered from acute gastroenteritis live outside Baguio.\n ",
