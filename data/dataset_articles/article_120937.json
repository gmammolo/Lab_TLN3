  "text": "Nice weekend, arctic blast next week BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Today is starting out with a light freeze and is just the beginning of a prolonged cold snap. We’ll be mostly sunny, cool, and dry both days this weekend with highs near 60 both days. An Arctic front will move into the area Sunday, and deliver the coldest air we’ve had in several years. There will be a 30% chance of rain showers MLK Monday afternoon and evening, then Monday night into early Tuesday morning, we still have a very slight chance of freezing drizzle. At this time, there is still uncertainty about whether the precipitation will be gone before the ground has ample time to freeze. But it doesn’t take much to cause a big problem in this neck of the woods! Nevertheless, there will definitely be a hard freeze Tuesday and Wednesday morning, with lows approaching the teens Tuesday night into Wednesday. There will be dangerous wind chills as well. In the extended, expect another round of hard freezes later next week. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo. Copyright 2024 WAFB. All rights reserved.",
