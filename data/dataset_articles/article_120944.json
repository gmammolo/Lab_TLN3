  "text": "Okla. — FOX23 spoke with an EMSA paramedic about the importance of dressing for the cold weather and being prepared. As of midnight on Jan. 12, EMSA has responded to four cold related calls and transported two patients to the hospital. Preparing to be outdoors is key, according to EMSA Paramedic Shawn Burch who has spent more than two decades on the job. He’s also a clinical services manager and offered advice. “Whether you’re taking a ten-minute drive across town or walking to your mailbox, be dressed for the weather,\" he said. \"Bad things happen when you don’t expect them to happen.” With temperatures dropping down into the single digits this weekend, he says it’s all about dressing in layers. In addition to putting on the heavy coat, it’s also important to wear the hat and gloves, and hand warmers can also be helpful. “Stocking caps are great, a lot of people like to wear just like the little earmuffs, I would probably go as far with this weather with the stocking cap that covers your ears as well,” he said. Burch says signs of hypothermia include when you stop shivering, things like slurred speech, confusion, and maybe some lethargy or difficulty walking. It can eventually lead to being unconscious. According to the CDC, signs and symptoms of frostbite include: - Redness or pain in any skin area Other signs include: - A white or grayish-yellow skin area - Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy - Numbness As far as when you need to go to the emergency room, if the numbness isn’t going away and the discoloration isn’t going away, Burch said it’s probably a good time to go in and get it evaluated. Burch said if you're driving, pack essentials like jumper cables, blankets, snacks, and water. Don't forget to charge your electronics which lose power quickly in the cold. Bringing a charged battery pack for your phone is also a good idea.",
