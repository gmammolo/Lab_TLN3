  "text": "Clear and cool weekend MOBILE, Ala. ( [WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/)) - We can expect a beautiful weekend of weather along the Gulf Coast. The forecast shows cool temperatures and sunny skies for both Saturday and Sunday. However, the chance of showers will return on Monday night, preceding a strong blast of Arctic air. WEEKEND: Over the weekend, cooler temperatures are anticipated. Both Saturday and Sunday mornings will begin in the 30s, but temperatures will rise to the 50s in the afternoons. With ample sunshine, no rain is expected during this period. COLD NEXT WEEK: Late Monday into Tuesday morning, there may be a few showers ahead of a significant cold blast. There’s a small chance that we might see temperatures below freezing on Tuesday morning, possibly leading to a small amount of freezing rain. However, the likelihood of this happening remains uncertain. For now, we’re noting a slight chance of rain transitioning to freezing rain early on Tuesday morning for our far inland areas. Following the cold rain, more severe cold will set in. Starting Tuesday morning, the lows will begin to fall, starting at around 32 degrees on Tuesday and dropping to the teens by Wednesday. This will result in hard freezes each morning, potentially affecting plants and pipes. It’s essential to prepare for this significant freeze next week. Start planning to protect your pipes, plants, and pets. Regarding afternoon temperatures next week, they aren’t expected to be much warmer than the mornings. Tuesday’s temperatures might struggle to rise above the 30s, and Wednesday’s temperatures are forecasted to remain in the 40s. In addition to the bitter cold, windy conditions are expected on Tuesday and Wednesday, causing wind chill values to fall even lower than the air temperature. Single-digit wind chill values can be anticipated on Wednesday morning. So, as you prepare for work or school, be prepared to bundle up. Copyright 2024 WALA. All rights reserved.",
