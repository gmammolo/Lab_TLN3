  "text": "Good morning, all you glorious Newdists. You know how much I yearn for snow. We’re doing snow today! I hope you all are in good health (no COVID, no flu, no bone aches etc.) and thriving in this winter weather. Newdists, recently, I’ve limited my time on X, and have been the better for it. How are you all handling the world wide stuff?

When looking at the ears, we are primarily checking for parasites, bruising, or wounds.

It wasn’t called a “resort” then. It was simply Solitude Mountain. I've resented that “resort” ever since they added it. A day to play in the sun before the next storm comes!
