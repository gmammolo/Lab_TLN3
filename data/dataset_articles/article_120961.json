  "text": "Winter Warming Center to open Sunday Published 11:09 Beautiful. That is the word Joanne Coleman, SC3, used more than once to describe the community’s response to helping meet the needs of the homeless in anticipation of sub-freezing temps. Individuals, businesses, industry, churches and other nonprofits responded to a list posted by SC3 earlier this week when the Sulphur nonprofit announced its Winter Warming Center, 501 E. Burton St., in Sulphur, will open 6 p.m. to 7 a.m. beginning Sunday evening, Jan. 14. In addition to donations the endeavor includes the Open Door Biker Church, Freedom 337, Empowerhouse Ministries, Sulphur Community Church and Care Help. “Helping others, serving, that’s part of being a Christian,” Coleman said. “I think people want to help, but knowing how to help and helping in the right way is never easy.” Givers shared funding, food, jackets, blankets and other supplies. Volunteers who will help operate the warming center have been trained in advance. “Knowing how to help and helping the right way is never easy,” Coleman said. “You have to love people where they are.” Typically, SC3 serves the homeless Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The following items are sought to supply the overnight warming center and future efforts to shelter the neighbors with no homes: new pillows and pillow cases, heavy blankets, lap blankets, coffee, creamer and sugar, individually packaged snacks, pre-packaged breakfast items, canned or bottled drinks, paper plates and plastic utensils, trash bags (15 and 55 gallon), sanitizing products, flashlights and batteries, jackets and sweatshirts, new mens and womens underwear, winter hats and gloves, dog kennels, leashes and food, laundry detergent and small heaters (for homes), Financial donations are used to fill any gaps. Items can be shipped to or dropped off at 501 E. Burton St., Sulphur, LA, 70633, M-Th, 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.",
