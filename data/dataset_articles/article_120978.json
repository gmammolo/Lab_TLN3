  "text": "Restaurant thanks workers for braving dangerous winter storms with free food GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (Gray News) - A long weekend of ferocious winter weather is keeping multiple agencies and essential workers busy. Michigan is one of the states expected to welcome [another round of snowstorms](https://apnews.com/article/us-chicago-winter-storms-deadly-cold-2c9daa8ea3db7c254618621f4144472c) and dangerously cold temperatures. And a restaurant in the Grand Rapids area is thanking those workers for helping the community through the wave of Arctic storms by offering them a free meal. On Friday, [Amore Trattoria Italiana](https://www.facebook.com/AmoreTrattoriaItaliana), shared online that its team would treat essential workers who came to their restaurant to a free hot meal as a thank you. “Please let your snowplow friends & power company folks & tow truck drivers & EMTs… that we would love to treat them to hot lasagna soup and bread for free,” a [social media post ](https://www.facebook.com/AmoreTrattoriaItaliana/posts/pfbid031YxUtfwSeKYhHmY5Xs7ZRPBYzCt8BoYUfDJvuYFZjEHt6mpBEmiicc1LKAaxUNiFl)read. The restaurant’s post has since been shared more than 3,500 times while gaining many positive comments from the community. “This is everything we need right now. This is love,” Facebook user Michaela Mojava wrote. Facebook user Joel Slot added, “Y’all just earned my business for life, not many appreciate or understand what we go through. Thank you.” The [restaurant team shared](https://www.facebook.com/AmoreTrattoriaItaliana/posts/pfbid02XXFm2XKF6RhcqQ4Nce8GYn3CUXSWu9sV6EuZJLWbsCvHe41HS93SYRKPF2wSUierl) that they also left a cooler outside with soup and bread for those workers in need of a meal after hours. “They might not sleep all night tonight so warm food might help,” the staff shared. Grand Rapids is one of several cities in Michigan under a Winter Storm Warning where lake-effect snow is expected through Sunday, according to the [National Weather Service](https://weather.com/weather/today/l/Grand+Rapids+MI?canonicalCityId=4ae407ee1fd6fc2da14b1db23551dbfc725de102d758c0e22a6fe25d69942ec5).
