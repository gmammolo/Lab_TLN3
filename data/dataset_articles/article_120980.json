  "text": "KATY, Texas — During times of severe weather, Houston-area residents are known to step up and help those in need.\nThose include business owners.\nIn a Facebook post, Fuzzy's Pizza in Katy said its doors will be open for anyone who loses power during the [Arctic blast headed to Southeast Texas](/article/weather/houston-texas-weather-forecast/285-18e058cb-59c2-48ab-9e48-a6e3fe1f3fb6) as early as Sunday.\n\"...if you lose power and\nFuzzy's Pizza Katy still has power, our doors will be open for you,\" said Jeff Hajjar, the pizza shop's owner. \"Come, stay warm, and find a safe place to sleep here.\"\nThe state does not expect mass power outages like we experienced during the\n[February 2021 winter freeze](/search?q=February+2021+winter+freeze).\n“We feel very good about the status of the Texas power grid and ERCOT, too, to be able to effectively and successfully ensure that the power is going to stay on throughout the entirety of this winter storm episode,” Gov. Abbott said.\nERCOT has a dashboard that allows you to monitor real-time grid conditions.",
