  "text": "Fargo Memorial Guard, FM Legion Riders clean up Fargo National Cemetery despite blizzardy conditions FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - With the Christmas season having passed by, it was time to clean up the wreaths at Fargo National Cemetery, even if it meant collecting them on a blustery January morning. Members from the Fargo Memorial Guard and the FM Legion Riders spent part of their Saturday morning clearing the cemetery. The group of 50 spent around 20 minutes removing the wreaths that were placed on the grave sites as part of the annual “Wreaths Across America.” “I think normally on a nicer day, of course, we’d have a huge turnout, but we still have a lot of people still coming, so we’ll still get it done in a short time,” FM Legion Riders Assistant Director Marc Simonet said. The conditions made it difficult for some to make the journey out to the cemetery, with blowing snow and wind chills in the negatives impacting the region. The conditions made visibility low and whiteout conditions made it difficult to drive out to the rural cemetery. Despite the conditions, those that did show up were in good spirit. Jason Hicks, commander of the Fargo Memorial Guard, said that braving the weather was a great way to show respect to veterans. “We had marines that fought at the frozen Chosin Reservoir in conditions just like this. We’re out here picking up wreaths, we’re not in combat – we’re picking up wreaths – but that’s why we do what we do,” he said. Both Simonet and Hicks were thankful for those that did show up to help out today. To them, the event was a positive opportunity to give back to the cemetery and support veterans and their families. “You look at a day like today, and it just really gives us thanks that we have such a dedicated community out here and that we’re out here in all conditions, all kinds of weather and this just proves it – we have good people to help us,” Hicks said.
