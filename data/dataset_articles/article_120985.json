According to the interview, Kurowski was leaving an appointment and realized her car was stuck on the snowy ground.\n“I get in my car and I’m stuck. Like, I can’t back out. I can’t move forward,” Kurowski told Melby.\nKurowski explained that she saw Love walking past but didn’t want to bother him. Before driving away Love noticed that the car was stuck and pulled up to Kurowski’s vehicle to ask if she needed help.\nNFL quarterback by day, Good Samaritan by night!

We made eye contact a few times but he was getting in his car, I didn’t want to bother him.” Kurowski continued her story. “He gets out of his car and he’s like, ‘Are you okay?’ And I was like, ‘Are you Jordan Love?!’ I was fangirling.”\nUnfortunately, Love and Kurowski weren’t successful in moving the vehicle on their own.\nDespite the unfortunate circumstance with her car, Kurowski said it was a memorable experience. She took a photo with Love before sharing it with her family and posting it to social media.\n“I couldn’t even believe it. It didn’t feel real. I was in a state of shock,” Kurowski explained to FOX 11. “It’s blowing up and I think everyone is truly seeing that he’s not just an MVP on the field, but just a great, great person. He’s a great representation of what Green Bay is.”\nLove and the Packers finished the regular season with a 9-8 record. Green Bay clinched a playoff berth and will face the Dallas Cowboys during Super Wild Card Weekend. The Cowboys will host the Packers on Sunday, January 14 at 2:30 p.m. (MT) on FOX.\n.\n[@jordan3love]‘s strong afternoon continues as he throws his second touchdown pass of the game and 32nd this season.
