  "text": "Haley encourages Iowans to caucus despite the cold weather, telling them they could make history Haley also told Iowans that they will be setting the tone for the upcoming 2024 GOP presidential primaries. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley encouraged Iowa voters on Saturday to be sure to caucus on Monday, despite the cold weather. \"Now Monday is going to be cold,\" Haley said during a speech in Cedar Falls, Iowa, [according to CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/election-campaign-news-01-13-24/index.html) \"Really cold. But what I’m asking is if you will take the time to not just go to the polls, take people with you. Wear layers, because you might be standing in line. Take your ID. But think of the fact that you might be making history in this moment.\" The Iowa caucuses take place on Jan. 15. With parts of the state being under a blizzard warning, [both Haley](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/elections/haley-cancels-person-campaign-events-after-iowa-blizzard-warning) and former [President Donald Trump](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/trump-cancels-three-iowa-rallies-due-bad-weather-will-host-tele) have had to cancel campaign events and rallies and instead, host tele-rallies and virtual town halls. As of now, Trump is still going to have one in-person rally on Sunday in Indianola. [Local media](https://www.kcci.com/article/iowa-caucus-forecast-dangerous-temperatures-wind-chills-below-zero/46342312#) reports that Monday will be the coldest day for the caucuses in recent history with an expected high of -2 degrees. Haley also told Iowans that they will be setting the tone for the upcoming 2024 GOP presidential primaries. \"You’ve got the opportunity to look back at the past and continue or go forward and start new,\" she told them.",
