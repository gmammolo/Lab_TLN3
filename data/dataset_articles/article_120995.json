  "text": "Creighton men's basketball weathers the Storm, holds off St. John's for fourth straight win.\nFor the first time in his career, Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino made the trip to Omaha.\nPitino and St. John's brought their own storm to the CHI Health Center, and even the storm outside didn't stop Creighton fans from packing the stands for this one.\nTrey Alexander was recognized before the game for reaching 1,000 career points.\nAlexander, a greater passer, went up top to Ryan Kalkbrenner who threw down the alley-oop.\nLater, Francisco Farabello tossed it to Baylor Scheierman in the corner, and with a splash, 17 points and 12 boards from Scheierman.\nJays got a nice boost from Steven Ashworth as well, chipping in 11 points.\nCreighton was up five points at the break.\nBut the Johnnies battled back midway through the second half as Zuby Ejiofor's jumper gave St. John's their largest lead at nine points.\nJays respond with a 12-2 run, and another Kalkbrenner jam put them up one.\nKalkbrenner came through with a game-high 18 points.\nAfter a pair of Alexander free throws, the Jays were up one in the final seconds.\nDaniss Jenkins came through with the jumper for the win, and it hit iron.\nCreighton stayed with it and knocked off the Johnnies, 66-65.",
