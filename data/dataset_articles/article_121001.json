  "text": "Style\nThese Luxe Italian Shoes Look So Effing Chic — & They Can Withstand Any Winter Weather\nGo ahead, wear them to every holiday party.\nFew things can frustrate outfit planning like wet weather — you want a shoe that perfectly coordinates with your look, but that won’t get ruined when the raindrops, sleet, and snow begin to fall. Such problems cease to exist with the Italian brand\nAquatalia, a luxe label that creates on-trend shoes especially designed to withstand moisture. Aquatalia crafts its shoes from leather treated with the brand’s proprietary weatherproofing technology that repels moisture and resists salt and stains while preserving the softness and suppleness of the leather, for shoes that will last season after season.\nI sifted through the pairs that feature weather-ready craftsmanship in styles that you’ll be itching to wear ASAP, like a pair of slingbacks in the season’s latest metallics that can take you from work to your holiday party, or a pair of on-trend crystal embellished ballet flats — and a surprising, sophisticated take on the classic ankle boot in ivory leather with a snipped toe. Keep scrolling to find shoes that are sure to become your new favorites, no matter what the forecast has in store.\nAn On-Trend Pair Of Slingbacks In The Season’s Must-Have Metallic\nWhen there’s no time for an outfit change between work and your holiday party, reach for the weatherproof\nArabella heel. A flared, lacquered kitten heel and elasticized slingback ensure the shoe is comfortable enough for all-day wear, while the snipped toe, decorative square buckle, and shimmery silver metallic leather effortlessly take your look from day to night. Also available in raspberry — a cheery, holiday red shade just as party-appropriate, along with a variety of chic neutrals — this shoe is primed to become your latest party essential.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 5\nThese Versatile Heeled Booties\nTrousers, denim, skirts, dresses — the mixed suede and leather\nRowanna boot will look incredible with so many pieces in your wardrobe, they’re sure to become a mainstay. Crafted from soft, weatherproof leather (this white shade is a mod choice) with a rubber outsole and inner zipper, they’re as practical as they are chic. They feature a snipped toe, fitted 6.8-inch shaft and slender 2.5-inch heel for a silhouette that can take you from day to night — and even that upcoming holiday party.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 2\nThis Pair Of Pumps With A High Block Heel\nIf you can’t imagine a heel that’s stylish enough to pair with party outfits and actually comfy enough to dance the night away, Aquatalia’s\nPeony shoe can expand your horizons. The slip-on weatherproof leather silhouette is designed with a 2.9-inch block heel and Aquatalia’s signature flexible outsole, for a shoe that’s just as much about function as it is about form. This on-trend metallic silver adds the perfect holiday pop.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 11\nA Pair Of Sleek, Classic Flats\nFrom the dainty pointed toe to the luminous gold sheen of the leather, Aquatalia’s\nPenina flats are full of chic details — how adorable would they be paired with a holiday mini dress? Featuring a covered 0.8-inch heel with a flexible rubber outsole, the weatherproof Penina is a part of Aquatalia’s 24/7 Collection; the sort of chic, wearable shoe you’ll want to wear constantly.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 11\nA Timeless Loafer With The Coziest Faux Fur Lining\nLined in the softest faux fur, the\nRomy flat combines the sensation of your favorite cozy slippers with the the timeless silhouette of a loafer for a shoe that you’ll want to wear any time the temps turn chilly. The fuzzy lining is complemented by a sleek and subtle square toe and stacked sliver heel. Try pairing these weatherproof winter flats with slouchy trousers and a cashmere sweater for the ultimate in quiet luxury.\nSizes: 5—12 | Colors: 4\nA Pair Of Over-The-Knee Boots To Wear With Skirts & Dresses\nTry pairing the extended, over-the knee shaft of the\nNatessa boot with skirts and dresses. The extra-long 18-inch shaft height will disappear under maxi and midi dresses, keeping the silhouette seamless and balanced. Featuring an inside zipper and a stacked 1-inch heel with a rubber outsole and leather sock lining, the shaft is designed with a hint of stretch for the ultimate in both comfort and timeless style. Made in Italy with a weatherproof build, these are boots that will go the distance.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 3\nThese Suede Chukka Boots With A Fuzzy Lining\nA pair of suede chukka boots like the\nMadelina can pair with everything from dresses and skirts to loungewear — and come with the added benefit of a soft faux fur lining to protect against the cold. The lace-up design features a 1-inch heel with a slightly chunky EVA outsole, and a shaft height of nearly 5 inches. You’ll wear these practical yet adorable boots all winter long, because they’re inclement weather-ready.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 3\nThese Tall Boots For Dressing Up & Staying Warm\nDress up and stay warm in these\ntall heeled boots. The 15.5-inch shaft is crafted from stretch suede (that’s fully weatherproof) with an inner zipper for easy on and off. Try contrasting the fitted silhouette with flowy midi and maxi dresses. The sturdy 3.3-inch stacked heel and low-profile platform make these a polished choice for office and evening wear alike.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 5\nA Pair Of The Sweetest Slingback Flats\nDay or night, any time is the right time for the\nJanetta slingback flats. The elasticized strap and ground-level heel are comfy enough for all-day wear, while a pointed toe is accented by a square buckle for a little chic, evening-appropriate detail. Try pairing this black suede version with holiday velvets, or choose the metallic silver shade for a jolt of luminosity. True to form, these are constructed with Aquatalia’s weatherproof technology.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 3\nThese Desk-To-Dance Floor Heels\nThe accessorizing potential of these weatherproof\nPasha heel cannot be overstated: The gleaming metallic leather, 1.8-inch heel, and pointed toe are laidback yet elegant, and would look just as incredible with denim and a T-shirt as a formal party dress. A flexible rubber outsole ensures good traction with ease of movement, whether that movement be to your desk or the dance floor.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 12\nThis Pair Of Ankle Strap Suede Heels\nYou might not consider these\nopen-toed sandals holiday party material, but think again: The plush black suede, buckled ankle, and wide toe strap are more than substantial enough to pair with the heavier fabrics and deeper shades that are typical of the season — especially when paired with coordinating tights. A wide 1.5-inch block heel and rubber sole provide comfort, stability, and day-to-night versatility.\nSizes: 5 — 12 | Colors: 2\nThis article was originally published on",
