  "text": "MINNEAPOLIS — The cold is creeping in, but there are a few things you can do to keep it out. [CenterPoint Energy](https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/news/1710) says for the next few days, you may want to be mindful of the thermostat. \"With colder weather, and especially since that's happening across the country, customers need more natural gas to keep their homes safe and warm,\" said Joshua Solis, lead communication specialist for CenterPoint Energy Minnesota. \"We want to encourage customers to reduce their thermostat to about 65 degrees when they're at home during the day, and then reduce that an additional five degrees at night or when they're away for an extended period of time.\" On top of that, energy companies recommend keeping your exterior doors shut and bolted, but keeping interior doors open to help with airflow. Solis recommends turning your ceiling fans on and rotating them slowly, which circulates the warm air. During the day you want to keep your drapes and blinds open to maximize heat from the sun, and at night you want to keep them closed so you can retain heat. Experts also recommend checking on your furnace filter. You can drip your faucets, keep cabinet doors open, and cover hose bibs to protect pipes. \"Traditionally, the wholesale prices of natural gas have been pretty affordable, they are starting to go up a little bit right now with this cold spike,\" said John Marshall, the regional vice president of Xcel Energy. \"Typically in the winter season, your heating bills really account for half your total energy bill. So we do encourage folks to be prudent with their thermostats.\" [Xcel Energy](https://stories.xcelenergy.com/ArticlePage/?id=Xcel-Energy-shares-energy-saving-tips-as-colder-weather-looms) also wants to remind residents to keep their natural gas meters clear, avoiding a dangerous buildup of pressure in gas lines and leaks.
