  "text": "Visit the grand opening of the Bartz Snow Sculpture on January 19th to see their amazing and gigantic design! Mother Nature and a crazy amount of creativity usually make a great team in New Brighton. The Bartz family has been creating large snow sculptures in their front yard since 2012. These sculptures aren’t just large, they are gigantic! When I say “usually” make a great team, the recent warm weather and lack of snow have made things difficult! The GRAND Opening: Bartz Snow Sculpture event usually takes place January 1st. This year it’s been very delayed due to the lack of snow. In fact, they’ve had to make their own snow this year and still delay the opening by a few extra days! The sculpture used to be built in their front yard in New Brighton, but the creations have gotten too big for that! This year it’s being held at the Brightwood Hills Golf Course in New Brighton. It’s open every day from 8am- 10pm. There will also be food trucks, other vendors and events every Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There’s no admission to view the sculpture, however the family appreciates donations. Each year the money raised goes towards clean water through the organization One Day’s Wages. When it does open, the hours will be 8am-10 pm until February 10th. However, they’re also inviting the public to come watch them work on the sculpture and there are even food trucks already as well a a treasure hunt, gnome hung and indoor winter market! Keep watching their facebook page for additional updates. Invite your friends, it will be fun! This is original content from NewsBreak’s Creator Program.
