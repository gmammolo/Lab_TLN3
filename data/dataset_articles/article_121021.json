  "text": "Don't worry about the animals at the National Western Stock show — they're built for outdoor weather and get extra hay on super-cold nights like the National Weather Service is forecasting for this weekend. Humans? Not so much. But fret not visitors, Stock Show officials invested in a fleet of buses to ensure folks get from their cars to the grounds in cozy comfort. The under-construction new livestock center ate up a lot of parking, including all of the exhibitors' parking, according to spokeswoman Karen Woods. They're now being shuttled to-and-from an off-site lot. So there's precious little on-site parking for the general public. That's why officials are urging visitors to use the Coors Field lot, and the shuttle buses that serve it. \"By 11 a.m. Saturday, all our lots were full,\" Woods said, adding that all the pro rodeos are sold out for this weekend and officials are expecting big crowds for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Accommodating the expected 150,000 attendees over the three-day weekend is a top priority. \"We're making sure our guests have easy access, and because our parking is free — we want to make sure we have the best service,\" Woods said. \"We don't want folks to have to pay $25 to park to come to the Stock Show. We want to remain an affordable outlet for families and the community. \"That's why Coors Field has been great.\" Drivers using multiple buses continue the circular route with enough frequency most guests don't have to wait long — if at all — for one. \"It's a 15 minute drive, so you're at the ticket office within 15 minutes of parking,\" she said. \"Then they step from a warm bus to a warm building.\" For more information, maps of the grounds, schedules and tickets, visit [nationalwestern.com](https://nationalwestern.com/).",
