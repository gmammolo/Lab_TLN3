  "text": "New Delhi: On Saturday, Srinagar in Kashmir registered a maximum temperature of 15 degrees Celsius, marking the highest January temperature in the past two decades. The Kashmir Valley is witnessing a notable departure from its usual weather patterns, experiencing a significant 100% deficit in snowfall for the month of January. Prolonged dry spells, devoid of snowfall in the plains of Kashmir, have resulted in temperatures rising 6 to 8 degrees Celsius above normal at many locations in the valley. The mercury levels exceed those observed in most northern parts of the country. In response to these unusual weather patterns, the weather department noted that sudden temperature changes have become common in recent times, a phenomenon also observed during the summer season. However, there is optimism in the expectation of a fresh western disturbance that may impact Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days, potentially bringing the first snowfall of the season, according to weather experts. The delay in snowfall is posing a threat to winter sports in the region, including skiing, snowboarding, and cross-country skiing. This delay has adversely affected tourism in the valley, as winter sports activities scheduled for January have taken a backseat. Even in the renowned hill resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir, typically covered in snow at this time of year, winter sports have been impacted. The dry spell has led to the cancellation of hotel bookings, particularly in Gulmarg, which traditionally attracts a significant number of tourists during the winter season.
