  "text": "Brittany Mahomes Shares ‘Frozen Visuals’ from Arrowhead, While Expressing Delight to See Fans Fill the Stands Despite Harsh Weather [Vasudha Mudgal](/author/vasudhamudgal/) |Published As the [Kansas City Chiefs](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/kansas-city-chiefs/) geared up for their matchup against the [Miami Dolphins](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/miami-dolphins/), [Brittany Mahomes](https://thesportsrush.com/tag/brittany-mahomes/) took to Instagram to share an insider’s view of the wintry conditions at Arrowhead Stadium. Her posts were a vivid portrayal of the freezing weather gripping Kansas City, where even the windows needed a bit of extra attention. Despite the spine-chilling cold, fans filled up the stadium in hordes, making it a vision in red, something Brittany expressed her appreciation for. Advertisement The first story Brittany shared was a lighthearted look at the pre-game window cleaning. Due to the intense cold, the windows had frosted over, turning the stadium’s serene views into a hazy wonderland. In her video, Brittany can be seen saying, “Keep up the hard work, boys,” with fellow suite members sharing a laugh at the situation, highlighting the efforts taken to keep everything in top shape despite the chilly weather.

The stands, she anticipated, might not fill up due to the extreme cold. Yet, to her delight and perhaps surprise, the Chiefs Kingdom showed up in full force. Her story, aptly captioned “Chiefs Kingdom, be showing up,” captured the essence of the fans’ unwavering support for their team. Brittany’s last visual was a stark reminder of the day’s freezing conditions.

This was a day when Arrowhead Stadium, with its open dome, could not escape the grip of winter. The Chiefs and Dolphins braved these “dangerously cold temperatures” for a night of thrilling NFL playoff action. Brittany Mahomes Slays in Red and White Brittany’s Instagram was not just about the cold. It was also a canvas for her personal moments and her support for the team. She was seen donning a striking red jacket emblazoned with Patrick’s number, paired with a white furry beanie. Her smile radiated warmth, even in the icy conditions. The red jacket was a twinning moment with her new bestie and new addition to the Chiefs’ WAGs club, [Taylor Swift](https://thesportsrush.com/nfl-news-adorned-with-custom-travis-kelce-special-jacket-taylor-swift-arrives-at-freezing-arrowhead-to-witness-dolphins-vs-chiefs-game/).
