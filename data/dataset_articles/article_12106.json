  "text": "According to a recent permit filing, Golden Roosters will soon open its new Downtown location at 115 Occidental Ave S. “We will try to open on January 15th of 2024! We will be doing fried chicken in a sports bar. We even have a 180-inch projector installed for customers to watch games,” the owner, Sean Yoon, told What Now Seattle . “As a sports fan in Seattle, I couldn’t find a good sports bar for local fans. I always wanted to make a sports bar and have a touch of Korean food, and I would love to make space for sports fans in Downtown Seattle.” Sean had expressed that the fried chicken would specifically be of Korean origin. The hallmark of Korean fried chicken is often considered to be its double-frying technique. The chicken is first fried at a lower temperature to cook the meat thoroughly, and then it undergoes a second round of frying at a higher temperature. This dual-frying process results in exceptionally crisp and light skin while ensuring the meat inside remains juicy and tender. One of the most popular variations is the yangnyeom chicken, which involves coating the fried chicken in a sweet and spicy glaze made with ingredients like gochujang (Korean red chili paste), soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. The sauce imparts a balance of heat, sweetness, and umami to the chicken. In addition to yangnyeom chicken, there are various other flavors and styles of Korean fried chicken. Ganjang chicken, for example, features a soy-based glaze that is savory and slightly sweet, offering a different taste experience. Some variations also include cheese, honey, or additional toppings like green onions and sesame seeds for added depth and texture.
