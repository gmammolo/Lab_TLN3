  "text": "A nice finish to your weekend Meteorologist Austin Lowe has the latest forecast TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Weather headlines feature a nice end to the weekend... Cool and bright tomorrow. The rain showers make a return late into Tuesday. This will not be a total washout, but you need the rain gear. Behind that... Well, it’s going to be the coldest air of the season and likely the coldest air we’ve seen in a bit for the big bend in south Georgia. Expect below-average temperatures in our area over the next several days. I want to start with where things are right now... Cool in the 50s with a good amount of cloud cover. Clouds are expected to linger overnight which will prevent us from falling off too cold overnight. The regional view shows clearing on the way. Rain is not going to be a problem the next few days, nor is severe weather. Rain returns on Monday night/Tuesday timeframe... And look snow to the north, yikes. That will not make its way to us, but the cold air associated with it will. Which I will talk about momentarily. Showers most likely arrive on Tuesday for most. These will be scattered in nature and not a washout of a day. After the front passes... much colder on Wednesday with highs in the 40s. Lows will be cold enough to support a hard freeze by Tuesday and Wednesday nights. So think about the plants, pets, and livestock those nights. Cover them or bring them indoors. Layer up as you head outside, the wind will make it feel even colder on Wednesday. And use caution while using those space heaters. To recap, quiet over the next few days with the mid-60s. Tuesday there’s a chance of showers 50% right now not going to be a washout of a day just have the rain gear handy and the really cold stuff Wednesday and Thursday with highs in the 40s to mid-50s and Friday we bring the rain chance back at about 40%.
