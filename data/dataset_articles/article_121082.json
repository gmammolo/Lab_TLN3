  "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. - The temperature is dropping and the ArkLaTex is expected to get a winter blast in the next few days.\nThe forecasts means many people are grabbing generators and preparing their homes for the snow and cold.\nOthers are focusing on the less fortunate.\nHoly Mission Church of God and Christ, working with the Kingdom Project, is partnering to become a safe haven for those who need a warm place to stay during the freezing weather.\n“They give me food. They give me cold water, good water. They give me blankets, clothes, jackets, shoes, socks, keep me warm,” said Latasha Specks, helped by the Kingdom Project.\nSpecks is trying to get back on her feet. Until she does, she is grateful for the help.\nShe is getting help from volunteers from the Kingdom Project.\nThey provide food, clothes, blankets, and a warm place for many to sleep.\n“You know, it's an old proverb saying, we don't care why he's in the ditch. We don't care how they got in position,” said George Costict, district mission president for Kingdom Project. “It's our job as man, people of God to be a helping hand to those who are out there like that. “\nThe group serves dozens a day in downtown Shreveport.\nJoy Johnson is a volunteer with the Kingdom Project. She says she has seen so many people impacted by this center.\n“Well, I feel like the people are thankful, you know, everyone wants to know that somebody cares and that somebody is there to lend a helping hand, whether it's food, shelter or something to drink, an encouraging word, prayer, whatever it is,” said Johnson.\nHoly Mission Church will be open 24 hours until next Saturday, January 20.\nKingdom Project says they rely on donations to keep the center open.\nYou can donate towards this center at Holy Mission Church on 1054 Texas Avenue.\nMore from this section Caddo Parish Animal Shelter needs fosters for dozens of dogs before cold snap",
