  "text": "Miami and Fort Lauderdale recorded high temps again on Saturday before the cold front passed! Miami reached 86 breaking the old record of 84 and Fort Lauderdale reached 86, which tied the record.\nToday will be much cooler and we are already feeling the difference this morning. Temps are starting out in the upper 60s to low 70s. There are storms working through Broward County and that will continue for the first half of the day before they break up and become a lot more scattered.\nHighs today will be dependent on how fast and how long we break to the rain showers later on, but we should still expect to be in the low to mid 70s across the area.\nOvernight, the clouds linger and this will keep us nearly the same as this morning with a low of 68 but it will be breezy with the east wind 10-15 mph and gusts 20+ mph.\nGet South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox.\n[Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.]\nFor MLK day on Monday, we’ll stay mostly cloudy with a lower rain chance throughout the day. Breezy conditions last into Monday as well with highs in the upper 70s.\nThe next cold front will inch closer to the region as we head into the middle of the week. Late night showers arrive Tuesday with much of the day being rain-free. But the unsettled weather sticks around through Wednesday and lingers into Thursday before the front kicks out of here. Temps won’t move too much and stay in the 70s with overnight lows cool and in the 60s.",
