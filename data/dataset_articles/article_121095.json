In the greater Lake Tahoe area, a winter storm warning is in effect, and travel advisories are in place due to worsening conditions\nIn California, the National Weather Service has issued High Surf Advisories due to breaking waves of 20–25 feet along the coast while northern counties are bracing for heavy snowfall, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, and potential power line damage due to freezing rain.\nThis severe weather is expected to continue into the coming week, with the National Weather Service warning that every state in the U.S. has an active watch, warning, or advisory in place.\nBut Pasadena is expected to enjoy warming days under sunny skies. Friday could be sunny and 70, according to the NWS.\n“High confidence that relatively benign weather will continue through Thursday or Friday,” the NWWS said in its forecast at 3:24 a.m. Sunday.\nHere is the NWS day-by-day outlook for Pasadena this week:\nToday: Patchy fog before 11 a.m. Otherwise, cloudy through mid-morning, then gradual clearing, with a high near 63.
