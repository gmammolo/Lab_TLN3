  "text": "Dustin’s First Alert Forecast: Another mild day will lead with less wind and partly sunny skies Mild air will be traded for an arctic chill GREENVILLE, N.C. (WITN) - As we began Sunday on a cold note, partly sunny skies and less winds, with breezes from the southwest from 10-20 mph. A few gust could peak up to 30 mph in a few isolated spots. Highs will hold in the 50s and lows in the 30s. Another comfortable day for our Martin Luther King Jr. Day for ENC, with partly cloudy skies. Tuesday will start out chilly, then warming up to the upper 40s to low 50s. Chance of rain moves in later in the day, as most areas will see less than a quarter of an inch of rain. If the cold air can catch up with the moisture, a few snow flurries are possible, but will not amount to anything measurable. Any accumulation will be outside of the ENC viewing area and the higher accumulation will be closer towards the NC/VA border. Once the precipitation moves out, we turn cold and sunny. Highs will be in the 30s and 40s, as overnight temperatures fall to the 20s. Another storm system will be moving later Thursday afternoon to ENC. As of the latest data, this looks like another rain event, as snow will be scarce once again. Next weekend will be the coldest air of the winter season in the ENC area since Christmas 2022, as highs stay in the low to mid 30s and lows fall to the teens. Make sure to keep pipes protected, bring in any plants and all pets, and protect yourself when you are out and about.
