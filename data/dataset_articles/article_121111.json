  "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - From start to finish, this one was never in doubt. One team played as though it had practiced in the subzero conditions for days, the other looked slow and stiff. The Chiefs may have played their most complete game of the season in a dominating 26-7 AFC Wild Card Round matchup against the Miami Dolphins. The temperature for the wild-card playoff game was minus-4 degrees Fahrenheit , and wind gusts up to 27 mph made for a wind chill of minus-27 degrees. That shattered the record for the coldest game in Arrowhead Stadium history, which had been 1 degree, set in a 1983 game against Denver and matched in 2016 against Tennessee. Kansas City never trailed, Patrick Mahomes threw for his most passing yards in nearly a month (262), Rashee Rice gashed the Dolphins secondary for 130 receiving yards and Dolphins’ playmakers could never get in rhythm. On the opening drive of the game, the Chiefs capped off a 9-play, 63-yard drive with a touchdown strike from Mahomes to Rice. A Tyreek Hill 53-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter would trim the Kansas City lead to 10-7, but the Chiefs kept Hill, wideout Jaylen Waddle and the running combination of Raheem Mostert and De’Von Achane in check the rest of the night. The Chiefs defense harassed Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throughout the game, picking him off once, sacking him twice and limiting the high-powered offense to just 171 passing yards. Harrison Butker continued his stellar season converting all four of his field goal attempts. The Chiefs advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff Round, which could potentially be Patrick Mahomes’ first road playoff game barring a Bills loss. The wild-card playoff game between the Chiefs and Dolphins became only the fifth postseason game ever played in subzero temperatures. Copyright 2024 KCTV. All rights reserved.",
