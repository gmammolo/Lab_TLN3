  "text": "Bills OL Alec Anderson helps driver stuck in snow in Buffalo The city of Buffalo is under a snowy lockdown after getting hit with a winter storm this weekend that was so bad that the city and league postponed the Bills’ home playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Buffalo is expected to gain approximately 12.75 inches of snow in the next 48 hours with max wind gusts hitting 42 MPH. While people in the community have been told to stay home, people have still been out on the roads — for better or for worse. Bills offensive lineman [Alec Anderson](https://www.on3.com/db/alec-anderson-2604/) was out and about on Sunday morning, and was seen helping a pedestrian in a stalled vehicle get out of the snow and ice. Anderson’s teammate, fellow OL [Ryan Van Demark](https://www.on3.com/db/ryan-van-demark-103833/), [recorded](https://twitter.com/BradleyGelber/status/1746557977543274588?s=20) the tail-end of Anderson helping get the sedan unstuck in the middle of the road by attaching a tow strap to the rim of their car. Anderson, a [UCLA](https://www.on3.com/college/ucla-bruins/) alumnus, has come a long way from enjoying beautiful, sunny weather daily in Los Angeles to the bitter, unforgiving cold in Buffalo. Surprisingly, he’s a quick thinker in the cold for a California native. Hoping for a break in the weather, the Bills are preparing for Monday’s delayed opening kickoff against the Steelers. Opening kick is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. ET and will air live on CBS. Buffalo will enter the game as a 10-point betting favorite over Pittsburgh, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Pittsburgh Steelers plan to fly to Buffalo on Sunday NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported the Steelers will hit a walkthrough and then fly out to Buffalo to prepare for the game. [The game was postponed due to an intense winter storm](https://www.on3.com/pro/news/buffalo-bills-pittsburgh-steelers-postponed-wild-card-game-update-time-monday/). “The Steelers have a noon walkthrough and plan to fly to Buffalo at 3 p.m. for Monday’s rescheduled wild-card game,” [Pelissero wrote on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1746559073854570872?s=20) “They have experience: In 2020, Pittsburgh had a game delayed 3 times because of a Ravens COVID outbreak and ended up playing on a Wednesday. So, this is nothing.” Pelissero’s colleague, Cameron Wolfe, was in a hotel in Buffalo and gave the latest on the snowstorm saying that no one is going anywhere — and neither is the snow. A winter warning, provided by [On3’s Nick Kosko](https://www.on3.com/pro/news/pittsburgh-steelers-plan-fly-buffalo-bills-sunday-playoff-game-amid-storm-monday-kickoff/), all but confirmed Wolfe’s report that the weather might continue to get worse in the coming hours. “A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for Erie, Genesee, Wyoming, Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties from 10 a.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Monday,” the initial report stated. “Per the NWS-Buffalo office: Heavy lake effect snow and very strong winds expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 feet in the most persistent lake snows. Blizzard conditions will be possible at times, especially Saturday night and Sunday. 8 to 17 inches of snow for the S. Tier counties under the warning.”",
