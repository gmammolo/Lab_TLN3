  "text": "The harbour in Antalya old town is one of a number of beautiful places to visit\nThere is a new top destination for winter sun, overtaking Tenerife as the best place to go to escape the freezing winter temperatures. On the Beach’s annual Big Winter Sun Report has named Antalya in Turkey as the number one location, with nearly 12% of sun seekers visiting the stunning city, a year-on-year growth of 33%.\nTenerife is still a popular destination for UK holidaymakers but it’s now not quite as popular as its Turkish rival, the Express reports. Antalya attracts tourists from all around the world throughout the year and is the fastest-growing city in Turkey.\nThe city is known for its Mediterranean Sea port, subtropical climate, ancient sites and stunning beaches. Antalya is also popular with tourists because of its hot summers and mild winters, making it the perfect spot for year-round holidays.\nRight now it’s 17C with a low of 4C in the evening. There’s a bit of rain in the forecast for next week, but considering much of our countryside has spent time underwater in the last few weeks we can forgive them that.\nZoe Harris, chief customer officer at On the Beach said: “It finally happened, Turkey has finally taken over Tenerife as the number one winter sun destination.”\nLanzarote in the Canary Islands came in third place followed by the Costa Blanca in Spain. In fifth place was Hurghada in Egypt, which saw a 53 per cent increase in winter sun holidays year on year.\nMajorca in the Balearic Islands came in sixth place followed by the Costa Del Sol in Spain, Sharm El Sheikh in Egypt and Fuerteventura in the Canaries. Another Turkish destination, Dalaman, completed the top 10. The city has been described as “absolutely beautiful” and “the jewel of the turquoise coast” by Rael Ellis Nakışçı on Quora.\nOne of the city’s highlights is “its beautiful coastline, which offers stunning views of the Mediterranean Sea”, according to Quora user Semih. Some of the city’s best attractions include Lara Beach, a Blue Flag status beach to the east of the city, and Hadrian’s Gate which is the main entrance to Antalya’s old town of Kaleiçi.\nTop 20 winter sun destinations Antalya – Turkey Tenerife – Canaries Lanzarote – Canaries Costa Blanca – Spain Hurghada – Egypt Majorca – Balearics Costa Del Sol – Spain Sharm El Sheikh – Egypt Fuerteventura – Canaries Dalaman – Turkey Costa de Algarve – Portugal Gran Canaria – Canaries Costa Brava – Spain Dubai – UAE Rhodes – Greece Crete – Greece Marrakech – Morocco Corfu – Greece Malta – Malta Riviera Maya – Mexico",
