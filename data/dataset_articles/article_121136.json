  "text": "EUGENE, Ore. — The Oregon men's basketball team got their fifth win of the Pac-12 season over Cal on Saturday. Despite the weather, the Oregon student section showed up to see center N'Faly Dante make his return to the Ducks. But Oregon did not quite get the start they wanted. The Golden Bears took the lead after going on a 7-0 run at the beginning of the first half, but the Ducks responded with a 13-2 run towards the end of the half. Oregon went into halftime down 43-39, but made a major comeback in the second half. The Ducks outscored the Golden Bears 41-30 in the second half. Oregon guard Jermaine Couisnard led the team with 18 points, three rebounds and one assist. Junior college transfer guard Jadrian Tracey also made a large impact for Oregon with 14 points and four rebounds. Guards Keeshawn Barthelemy and Jackson Shelstad both added 12 points each and Dante tacked on another eight points and a rebound to help the ducks get the 80-73 victory. Oregon will hit the road to face Colorado on Thursday.",
