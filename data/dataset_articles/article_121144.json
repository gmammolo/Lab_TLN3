  "text": "The temperature at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday night might have been at -4° with a wind chill at -20°, but Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco is running hot. The former Rutgers star running back is running as angry as ever, just in time for the NFL playoffs.\nIn Saturday night’s AFC Wild Card round, Pacheco ran hard for 89 yards on 24 carries, scoring a touchdown to help the Chiefs to a 26-7 win over the Miami Dolphins. The Chiefs, despite the frigid temperatures , are running into the next round of the NFL playoffs\nPacheco ended the regular season on a high note, with 130 rushing yards on 18 carries. Despite battling injuries, Pacheco had 935 rushing yards and seven touchdowns – both career highs – in 14 games.\nA seventh-round pick out of Rutgers in the 2022 NFL draft, Pacheco had a strong rookie season for the Chiefs as he played a huge part in their run to the Super Bowl.\nNow, he is part of a Chiefs offense that was efficient and productive against a very strong Dolphins team.\nRelated Hoosier Daddy!
