  "text": "Winter frosts will create big problems for drivers, especially those who have old and worn-out batteries in their cars. If your battery drains quickly in cold temperatures, it may be time to replace it. However, if you’re not ready to take this step yet, there is an easy way to improve the situation.\nWhy does the battery discharge in cold weather?\nIf you are interested in the question of why your car battery discharges on frosty days, then the answer lies in the chemical processes occurring inside. The optimal temperature for the battery is about 20-25 degrees Celsius. In such conditions, he works with full dedication.\nThe lower the temperature, the slower the electrochemical reactions occur, causing the battery to lose efficiency.\nAt temperatures around -10°C the battery only works at 80%. your strength. In severe frosts, battery efficiency can drop to 50-60%. But the problems don’t end there – a very cold engine is more difficult to start, it has more resistance, and the starter does not have as much power as at higher temperatures. All this means that the greatest load on the battery occurs on frosty days, which can lead to its discharge.\nHow to help the battery start the car in cold weather? There is one trick\nHowever, all is not lost. There is a simple trick that will help you start your car in the cold. Experienced mechanics know that to do this it is necessary to turn on the low beam a couple of tens of seconds before turning the key. Thanks to this, the battery “wakes up” before it is heavily loaded. Thus, electrochemical processes begin to occur before the engine starts, and not during it.\nHowever, be sure to turn off the lights before starting the engine.\nAnd here is a\nvideo of an experiment that proves the effectiveness of this trick:\nAnother trick from the 90s\nThere is another simple way to cope with a “difficult start”. If your battery doesn’t perform well on frosty mornings, if you have to charge it often, and if your car is used mostly for short distances, it’s worth using a method that was popular in the 80s and 90s. It involves removing the battery and storing it at home overnight. Thanks to this, in the morning, after reinstallation, the battery will work at full capacity.\nOf course, this method requires time. However, a warmed-up battery will certainly cope with starting the car in the morning better than one that was exposed to sub-zero temperatures all night. If you have an important meeting in the morning and your battery has failed you more than once, perhaps using this trick is a better solution than suffering with the engine in the morning.\nTelegraph previously wrote that low temperatures began to affect the operation of machines. Cars are starting to freeze, which means scrapers and de-icers are back in fashion. However, if almost everyone copes with the external consequences of a drop in temperature, only a few cope with those invisible to the eye, but no less important.\nHow do you like the news?",
