  "text": "Buffalo continues to deal with lake effect snow as Bills fans wait to see their team play their wild-card round game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday. The blizzard-like conditions have wreaked havoc in the area, which led to a [state of a emergency](https://news.yahoo.com/gov-hochul-declares-state-emergency-221518921.html) declared by New York Governor Kathy Hochul and [a travel ban](https://sports.yahoo.com/travel-ban-remains-place-around-140644217.html) in the area that resulted in the [Bills-Steelers game](https://sports.yahoo.com/afc-wild-card-preview-steelers-without-tj-watt-try-to-keep-up-with-bills-134706324.html) being [moved from its original](https://sports.yahoo.com/steelers-bills-playoff-game-moved-to-monday-afternoon-new-york-governor-announces-172059048.html) Sunday afternoon scheduled start. One motorist near Orchard Park became stranded and received an assist from Bills offensive lineman Alec Anderson. As documented by Anderson's [good pal](https://www.niagara-gazette.com/sports/brotherly-relationship-pushed-alec-anderson-ryan-van-demark-from-bills-practice-squad-to-active-roster/article_b2780392-4d07-11ee-a1f0-b7122463731a.html), fellow Bills offensive lineman Ryan Van Demark, Anderson helped get the stranded motorist back on the road. — Bradley Gelber (@BradleyGelber) [#Bills]OL Ryan Van Demark shares a video of fellow OL Alec Anderson appearing to help a driver on Southwestern in OP. [pic.twitter.com/JyB9ZjxHx5] [January 14, 2024] \"Good Samaritan, Alec. Helping the people,\" said Van Demark, who posted the video on [his Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/ryan_vandemark/) Sunday. As the conditions remain harsh, the [NFL's statement](https://twitter.com/AdamBenigni/status/1746588592665698609) on the status of Monday's game is that, \"Everything is moving forward as planned for tomorrow.\" Just by looking at video of the road around Highmark Stadium, you can see why the right decision was made to postpone the game. — New York State Thruway Authority (@NYSThruway) [#WNY]SNOW: In case you were still questioning why there isn't a [@BuffaloBills]game right now. 2pm look at the Thruway near Highmark Stadium. Stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. [#BillsMafia] [#BuffaloBills] [#BillsVsSteelers] [pic.twitter.com/PX9dJnHqnm] [January 14, 2024] The Steelers, meanwhile, were set to fly to Buffalo on Sunday afternoon, [according to NFL Network's Cameron Wolfe](https://twitter.com/CameronWolfe/status/1746617092344811975). As long as the weather doesn't get any worse than it already is and road conditions improve, there should be no issues for the teams and fans traveling to the stadium for the game.",
