  "text": "With temperatures improving from -30 C to a balmy -15 C, Apex Mountain ski resort and Baldy Mountain have re-opened on Sunday. According to the Apex website, the quad, magic carpet and T-bar will be in operation 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. but the triple chair will not be running. The tube park is also back open. Apex management announced on Thursday that temperatures of -30 C and windchill of -35 C were too dangerous to operate the ski hill. They closed both Friday and Saturday. Prior to closing on Friday, the ski mountain received a total of 60 centimetres of new snow in the previous six days. “The conditions are amazing and the epic riding is finally here,” posted Apex on their social pages. Baldy also closed Saturday due to the frigid temperatures. The Sugarlump started loading at 9:30 a.m. with the magic carpet also open. There is a delayed opening on eagle. Both mountains are urging people to dress warm with layers.
