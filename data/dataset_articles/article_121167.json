  "text": "Sunday, January 14th 2024, 2:18 pm As temperatures plummet to single and even negative digits, many vulnerable people are left wondering where to go to stay warm. “It’s -1 right now outside, and -16 with the wind...the cold cuts right through you,” said Keith McPhail, co-founder of B the Light Mission in Bartlesville. The brutally cold weather could mean life or death for some. “We’re just not gonna let that happen; whatever we can do, we’re going to provide this warm space,” said Keith's wife and co-founder, Christy McPhail. The B the Light Mission serves as a refuge from the dangerously cold temperatures. “We’re able to hold 38 people in here. Currently, we have 21 people and 4 dogs,” said Keith. The McPhail’s began the non-profit four years ago, but say they officially took off last year when a hospital donated them a building. “We can provide them shelter here and provide some love and some care,” Keith said. They both say helping the homeless is a calling. “We’ve both had loss in our life. I was a former drug addict myself, and we lost our oldest son 14 years ago…accidentally shot, and so we kind of understand what it's like to feel hopeless,” they said. Keith says at one point, he didn’t have a place to go. “There was no place like this when I was living in my car,” he said. There is only one other shelter in Bartlesville, and the McPhail's say it wasn't enough. “We feel like there’s room for two; they need help, and we’re gonna work together to help work on this problem that’s become so relevant,” said Christy. That’s why they jump into action and provide what others need. “3 meals a day, snacks all day, coffee, hot chocolate.... love,\" Keith said. And, of course, a lifeline during this cold snap. Their goal is to use every inch of the 58,000-square-foot building as a full-time homeless shelter. They were originally planning on closing on Thursday, but the mission will stay open until Friday because the temperatures will remain low.
