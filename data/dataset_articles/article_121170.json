Some of those viewers shared photos of those rainbows, and several of them were able to capture double rainbows on camera. One of those double rainbows was spotted over Boston's iconic rainbow-colored gas tank along Interstate 93 in Dorchester. \"Rainbows are actually circles, but when you view them from the ground, the ground cuts off the bottom part of it,\" said StormTeam 5 meteorologist A.J. Burnett. \"But when you look at them from higher above, you can actually make out an entire circle in some cases.\"",
