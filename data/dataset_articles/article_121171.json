  "text": "Belfast Waterfront bounces back after storm flooding BELFAST, Maine (WABI) -As one of the many coastal towns that was hit with flooding Saturday, Belfast remained resilient. Crews began cleaning up debris along the waterfront that were a result of Wednesdays and Saturday’s storms. The harbor walk was reopened, and many members of the community were enjoying the sun after a dreary week. We spoke to residents of the area and local business owners about their storm experience. “We had 38 inches of water in the brewery, and we’re prepared for high tides you know we have a lot of our equipment jacked up. So, we had all of our equipment two plus feet off the floor, but with 38 inches it beat us. It was the first time we had to fully evacuate the property because the water was so high.” said Daniel Waldon, co-owner of Marshall Wharf Brewing Company. “These kinds of events are really affecting the mid coast area, affecting the coast of Maine. I mean, this is something that we’re seeing, I think around the country now and it’s something that we’re going to have to learn how to live with and how we can deal with it.” stated John Steed, a resident of Belfast. Although the harbor and businesses located there experienced back-to-back storms, the community remained strong and evoked positivity. “Belfast is a strong community. I think everyone will recover and it might take some longer than others, but we’ll get back on our feet and keep going and make plans for the future.” added Daniel Waldon. Long term plans are being developed to hopefully minimize any future storm damage to the waterfront. Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
