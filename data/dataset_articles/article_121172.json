  "text": "A break from snowfall today and tomorrow\nHappy Sunday everyone!\nThe weather system which brought moderate to heavy snow yesterday has moved off to the southeast.\nVery cold wind chills are also no longer expected as winds have become light in all areas.\nHighs are topping out in the low to middle 20s this afternoon. This is lower than our typical highs in the low 40s this time of year. Overnight temps are still dangerously cold.\nMonday will be a few degrees colder as highs will be in the lower 20s, but the sub-zero readings are in the past. There may be some decent sunshine Monday afternoon.\nWe aren’t getting over the freezing mark until Tuesday. Moving into that day, conditions will be dry. As we move throughout the day, we can expect increasing clouds and more snow Tuesday night into Wednesday. This should be a quick round of snow unlike yesterday’s.\nTemps will reach the upper 30s and low 40s next week.\nKeep an eye on the Red Banner at the top of the page for updates on the winter weather watches, warnings and advisories as they update periodically during an event like this one.\nHave a great rest of your day and stay warm!\nDon’t forget to download the KTVZ Local Alert Weather App to stay safe and informed\niOS:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/ktvz-local-alert-weather-app/id1088330817\nAndroid:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ktvz.android.weather&hl=en_US",
