  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Right now, [warming centers across the region](https://www.wthr.com/article/weather/severe-weather/list-warming-centers-marion-county-shelters-indianapolis-snow-cold-arctic-blast-freezing-donations/531-c92ed50d-915b-40a8-8515-cd0611ea4118) are helping keep Hoosiers warm during this stretch of cold temperatures. At the [Wheeler Mission Center for Woman and Children](https://wheelermission.org/wheeler125/center-for-women-children/), they're helping families stay warm. Some of the ways they are prepared to offer warming shelters this winter is having overflow floor mats for for which families can sleep. \"It's an amazing facility, go by the rules, you stay warm and fed and I'm thankful,\" Stephanie Wagner said. Stephanie Wagner is staying at the center. She's spent the last two days off the streets, a place she says she would be normally. \"On the sidewalk I'm freezing and trying to keep myself warm,\" Wagner said. Wagner comes without a place to call home, but is now making the most of her time at the center to get back on her feet. \"If you haven't experienced it, then you can't imagine,\" Wagner said. \"Eat, shower, and I'm thankful.\" \"It's literally life and death to be outside in this type of weather,\" Brian Crispin, senior director at Wheeler Mission said. Crispin says their shelters are in winter contingency mode and are helping anyone and everyone who may need to keep warm this winter or have a hot meal. \"We've had close to a thousand people who stayed in all of our facilities. That's our men's shelter, our women's shelter. We also have a shelter in Bloomington,\" Crispin said. Meanwhile Indy Parks is also [helping folks stay warm with over a dozen shelters](https://www.indy.gov/activity/indy-parks-severe-weather-plan) across the metro area. On Sunday, they had to close their Brookside Park location due to power loss and no heat. In the meantime, Hoosiers like Wagner are just grateful for a place to get back on her feet. \"One second at a time, if that's what it takes. Move forward, head up and smile,\" Wagner said. Wheeler Mission said their winter contingency mode will be run through March. They are also in need of food donations.",
