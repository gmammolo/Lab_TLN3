  "text": "Stateline snowmobilers take advantage of heavy snow ROCHELLE, Ill. (WIFR) - Sub-zero temperatures keep many inside Sunday, but some winter weather enthusiasts have been waiting months to enjoy the snow. Steve Hill and Stuart White met while snowmobiling 16 years ago. They say it means more to them than just riding the rails. “I’ve made some lifelong friends as a result of joining the local clubs, being a part of something bigger, you have a wonderful sense of purpose and belonging, you have just really good people,” Hill said. “They’re honest, down to earth, hard-working.” White says it is not just an activity to enjoy with friends, but also family. “My kids love the snow. My son’s 9, he wants to be on the trail with me all the time,” White said. For Hill and White, snowmobiling is about comradery and building something greater than themselves, the Tri-County Snowmobile Alliance and the Rochelle Rail Riders, which tend to trails to ensure safe snowmobiling. “We do this for the betterment of the sport, we do this as goodwill of man,” said Hill. “This is done through volunteerism, we don’t sit there and reach our hands out, we go out and we make it happen and we do it because we care.” The Tri-County Snowmobile Alliance has existed for more than a decade. The next monthly meeting takes place on February 12 at Uptown Lanes in Byron. If you are looking to enjoy other winter activities like sledding, you can visit [Twin Sister Hills Park](https://rockfordparkdistrict.org/sledding) in Rockford or [Alpine Hills Adventure Park](https://alpinehillsadventure.com/), which plans to open Thursday, January 18.
