  "text": "Sunrise star Sally Bowrey has revealed her “number” as the US Powerball jackpots to $1 billion ahead of this weekend’s draw.\nThe newsreader got into a spirited discussion at Brekky Central on Friday, following a report on the massive jackpot, as she revealed the magic “number” — meaning how much money she would need to set her up for life.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Sunrise panel talks about massive US Powerball $1 billion jackpot.\nStream the world's best reality, entertainment and true crime shows for free on 7Bravo on\n7plus >>\n“(The amount it would take for me) is just $25 million — I think about this a lot,” Sally laughed following the report.\nThe astronomical number sent the panel into a fit of laughter.\n“You’ve done the maths,” quick-witted Mark Beretta said.\n“Enough to get by,”\nEdwina Bartholomew chimed in.\nThe Powerball jackpot has soared to $US760 million ($A1 billion) for Saturday’s draw, with a lucky possible winner having the option of an annual payout over many years or a cash lump sum of $US382.5 million, according to\nmultiple reports.\nThe panel went on to discuss the largest-ever lottery jackpot win in the US, which was the\n$US2.04 billion collected by Edwin Castro in November 2022, according to USA Today.\n“It’s too much money guys,” Sally joked.\nPowerball fever is gripping the US with the possible life-changing win on offer, with\nAustralians able to get a ticket through The Lottery Office, which will then purchase a matching ticket in the US draw.\nUS Powerball draws take place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays at 10.59pm US eastern time — which means for Australians the draws are on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at 1.59pm AEDT.\nEach game costs $7, and players pick five numbers from a pool of one to 69, plus another number between one and 26.\nOverall, the chances of winning a prize are one in 25 per game, according to The Lottery Office.\nThe odds of winning the jackpot are much slimmer, at one in 292.2 million, US Powerball says.\nIf you’re concerned about your gambling or the gambling of a friend or family member, log on to\nGambling Help Online or make contact via phone on 1800 858 858.\nStream Free on",
