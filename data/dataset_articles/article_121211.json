  "text": "The morning sun rises, casting the Helan Mountains in Ningxia Hui autonomous region in a golden hue as if the mountain peaks are ablaze with fiery red.\nIn the morning light, a herd of deer gathers, bathed in a golden-red glow that highlights the softness of their fur, outlining their graceful figures.\nThe deer stand in large groups and small pairs atop the mountain, occasionally stopping to communicate with low murmurs and engage in quiet conversations with each other.\nIn recent years, the ecological environment of the Helan Mountains National Nature Reserve has continuously improved, providing a favorable habitat for the deer population to thrive and reproduce.\nVideo by Qi Yingtao and Wang Yuan/For chinadaily.com.cn\nYang Zishuo contributed to this story.\nDeer bathe in a golden-red glow on the Helan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui autonomous region.
