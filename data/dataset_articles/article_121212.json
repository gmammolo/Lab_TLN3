LA CROSSE (WKBT) -- As the temperature starts to go below zero, the city of La Crosse is opening an emergency day shelter to keep the less fortunate warm. The shelter will only be open from Jan. 14 - 15 for a set time. For both days it will be open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and is located at 621 3rd Street North. Another shelter will be opening its doors and providing transportation from the La Crosse emergency shelter.
