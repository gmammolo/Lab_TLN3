Volunteers who sign up will be helping with the following:Setup: We need individuals to come in at 6pm to set up the beds. This would include changing out the pillow cases, making the bed and getting the dinner area ready to serve food.\nRide along: We would like volunteers to ride along with our drivers to pick up our guests from designated pick up spots. We want each of our guests to be greeted with a friendly smile and big hello as we open the doors to take them to the warming center.\nServing dinner: Each night we are open we want to be able to provide our guests who are unhoused a meal to eat. Volunteers would help to serve food to our guests and then are invited to sit and chat with them while they eat dinner.\nIt is a great time to connect with our unhoused friends and hear about things they enjoy, share some jokes and lend a listening ear.\nAdvertisement Event Venue & Nearby Stays Frontline Response, 2585 Gresham Rd SE, Atlanta, United States\nTickets USD 0.00\nFind Tickets Sharing is Caring:",
