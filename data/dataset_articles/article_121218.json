  "text": "TORONTO — Not sure why anyone would want to skip the Red Wings game Sunday, but anyone who did missed an entertaining game.\nAndrew Copp scored at 18 minutes, 20 seconds of the third period, giving the Wings a dramatic 4-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Copp's eighth goal was a shot from the point, shortly after Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov made a terrific stop off a deflection.\nLucas Raymond scored into an empty net to clinch the victory.\nThe Wings (22-16-5) have earned points in six consecutive games (5-0-1). The Wings are now one point behind Toronto for third place in the Atlantic Division (50-49).\nDaniel Sprong (his 11th goal) and Dylan Larkin (17th goal) had Wings goals, while goaltender James Reimer made 28 saves in his first start since Dec. 27. Sprong tied the score 2-2 at 2:46 of the third period.\nSprong took advantage of Toronto defenseman Morgan Rielly's stick exploding at the blue line and drove in alone, using a nifty move to his backhand to beat Samsonov.\nWhile the Detroit sports world was excited to get to a television set to watch the Lions, the Wings were simply glad to get to Toronto.\nThe Wings encountered weather and mechanical issues after Saturday's game and never left Detroit. They returned home in the middle of the night, and came back Sunday, only to wait for an available plane to arrive.\nThe Wings didn't reach Scotiabank Arena until 5:57 p.m., for what was scheduled to be a 7 p.m. start, was pushed back to 7:30 p.m, then finally 7:52 p.m.\nOriginally scheduled to fly to Fort Lauderdale for the rest of this road trip after game, the Wings are now flying Monday after staying the night in Toronto.\nThe only negative in the game for the Wings was losing forward Patrick Kane in the first period.\nKane was involved in a pair of collisions and suffered a lower-body injury that knocked him out of the game. There was no immediate update, but the concern likely is the right hip on which Kane had resurfacing surgery in June.\nPontus Holmberg and Mitch Marner had Leafs goals.\n©2024\nwww.detroitnews.com.
