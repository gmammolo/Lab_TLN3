  "text": "Camping gives people the opportunity to unwind and experience nature at its fullest extent. Yet, it’s always important to come to campsites prepared and ready for anything, as the outdoors can be quite unforgiving at different intervals of the year.\nA couple of students from Polytechnic Ibrahim Sultan recently experienced such a feat when they went camping at Batu Layar Beach in Kota Tinggi, Johor, and got a lot more than what they bargained for. In a clip shared to one of the students’ TikTok page\n@___zaiddd, the user gave some insight into how the massive rainfall turned their peaceful camping trip upside down.\nAt the beginning of the video, the duo revealed how the heavy rain weighed on their delicate camping tent, requiring them to hold it up from the inside using their bare hands. As the night continued, the storm only got heavier as the the tent tore in certain places, causing rain to come into their shelter.\nSlowing down for just a brief moment, the storm rushed in once again at around 3am.\nResponding to the video, multiple Malaysians stated that the boys must have chosen an improper time to go camping, while others asked if they had brought a flysheet with them, which is an outer fabric layer for tents that act as an additional protective layer. Unfortunately, the duo said they had not.\nHowever, a few people also defended the boys, saying that even those with a full camping set will not be able to protect themselves from harsh weather when it arrives.\n“Some of us with a complete set also will be scared to go camping during raining season. Only those with enough protection can go and do it bravely,” commented another user.\nWatch the full TikTok video below:\nDua orang pelajar Politeknik Ibrahim Sultan berada dalam situasi cemas ketika cuba untuk tidur di dalam khemah di Pantai Batu Layar, Kota Tinggi ketika musim hujan ribut🤣\n[#foryourpage] [#endofdiploma]\nIf you’re planning on going camping soon, maybe reschedule!\nAlso read:\nJohor Man Bravely Walks Through Chest-Level Flood Waters to Get to Work Despite Harsh Weather",
