  "text": "India aims to leverage tech to detect all small-scale severe weather events: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju\nWhile launching the yearlong 150th-anniversary celebrations of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Rijiju emphasised that weather and climate impacts are more pronounced than ever, and India strives to become a more climate-resilient country.\nIndia aims to detect and predict all small-scale severe weather events through the augmentation of its weather observation network and the procurement of more powerful computing systems, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said on Monday.\nWhile launching the yearlong 150th-anniversary celebrations of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Rijiju emphasised that weather and climate impacts are more pronounced than ever, and India strives to become a more climate-resilient country.\nHe said that although the IMD's forecast accuracy has improved by 40 per cent in the last five years compared to the preceding five years, challenges persist in predicting small-scale severe weather events such as cloudbursts.\nTRENDING NOW\nIndia aims to leverage tech to detect all small-scale severe weather events: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju\nBanking sector Q3 results preview: NIM likely to remain weak for top lenders with minor improvement in asset quality\nIncome Tax Slab: Modi govt may increase tax exemption in Interim Budget 2024; may increase limit by Rs 50,000\nHDFC Bank Q3 Results Preview: Net interest income likely to grow by one-fourth with steady asset quality\nGold and Silver rate today (January 15, 2024): Precious metals trade in green; yellow metal above Rs 62,500\nRBI’s upcoming monetary policy stance, FIIs, crude, global central bank action among key factors to influence bond yield\nShould you buy Wipro, HCL Tech, Dixon Tech, GCPL, Tata Consumer, HDFC Life, and other stocks today? Here is what brokerages suggest\nTo address this challenge, Rijiju highlighted the importance of augmenting the network of doppler radars and automatic weather stations.\nThe procurement of high-power computing systems will enable the IMD to run higher-resolution models, enhancing the ability to detect and predict all small-scale events in the future, he said.\n\"Everything depends on observations. The more observation capacity we have, the better our forecasting capacity,\" the minister added.\nThe meteorological department has already installed 10 doppler radars in the western Himalayan region and plans to establish 11 radars in the eastern Himalayan region, Rijiju shared.\nHe said India's rapid technological progress has greatly improved the accuracy of weather forecasts and life-saving early warnings, minimising the loss of lives during cyclones, heatwaves, and heavy rain events.\nRijiju said that climate change is impacting every sphere of society, with different sectors vulnerable to even small changes in climatic conditions.\n\"The least developed countries and developing nations are suffering more. We have to become more resilient to climate change and hazards,\" he said.\nCiting a survey by the National Council of Applied Economic Research, Rijiju said that the IMD's warnings and advisories are assisting farmers and the fishing community in improving their financial status.\n03:34 pm",
