  "text": "Protecting your pipes during freezing temperatures PRINCETON, W.Va. (WVVA) - The owner of Bud Hypes Plumbing in Princeton, Patty Hypes is sharing important advice for this colder time of year. Hypes says people can keep their pipes from freezing by opening cabinet doors on sinks to expose pipes to heat. Adding that you can also leave cold water running on the farthest sink from your water lines outside. Hypes says for this to be effective however, the stream from the sink needs to be about the size of a pencil. “They can also make sure, if its a mobile home that there’s no wind that can get in under the underpinning. Make sure it’s closed up good. In your homes you have vents on the outside of your house and make sure they’re closed to keep the cold air out from under the house,” said Hypes. Hypes says when water freezes it takes up more space than usual and when that frozen water thaws it can create a build up of pressure that leads to pipes bursting. She says there are other precautions you can take to ensure your pipes don’t freeze. “They should have their pipes insulated. That’s the first thing, that their pipes be insulated. If they don’t they can put a heat tape on it. Right when it comes into the house, that also helps,” said Hypes. Hypes says if a pipe were to burst in your home, it wouldn’t be cheap to fix. She says water damage can be expensive and that’s not all, you would also need to get the pipes fixed. She says this can cost thousands of dollars depending on how many pipes were damaged.
