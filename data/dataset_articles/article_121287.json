  "text": "Sen. Marshall Applauds Energy Providers for Preparation Ahead of Winter Weather Salina, KS – U.S. Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. applauds the planning and preparation of Kansas energy companies ahead of an expected winter weather event impacting Kansas starting Friday. “Kansas energy providers are no strangers to severe weather and through careful planning and preparation stand ready to keep the lights on for their customers,” said Senator Marshall. “In conversations with energy providers, utilities are reporting adequate fuel and generation capacity and are cautiously optimistic systems will withstand the strains of below-freezing temperatures and gusty winds.” Forecasts for the state indicate snow, severe freezing temperatures and gusty winds starting tonight and lasting through early next week. Conditions will create an increase in demand for energy as Kansans heat homes and businesses. Officials with the Southwest Power Pool – which coordinates energy transmission through 14 Midwest states, including Kansas – have issued a [resource advisory](https://spp.org/markets-operations/current-grid-conditions/#:~:text=Resource%20Advisory%3A%20Declared%20when%20severe,in%20SPP's%20balancing%20authority%20area.) beginning Sunday, January 14 through Thursday, January 18, cautioning energy companies of potential outages and potential impacts to energy generation and transmission. Kansans can help conserve energy by taking the following steps: – Turn the thermostat a little cooler – Run laundry and dishwashers during non-peak hours – Shut-off any non-essential heaters, appliances or lighting in homes and buildings If you experience a power outage, please contact your local energy provider.",
