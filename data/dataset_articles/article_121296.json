  "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — The snow is falling, the kids are out of school and you may be thinking it's time to have some fun outside!! While it may seem like a great idea to take your sled out or make some snow angels with your little one, it's important to remember these safety tips. Dr. Keith Toms, Internist at Generations Primary Care wants to remind parents of the things they should keep an eye on! \"first of all, little bodies lose heat a lot faster, little kids when having fun are not gonna stop,\" Toms said. \"So be mindful and make sure they stay warm, ears, nose, fingers and toes are all taken care of or they'll get frostbite.\" Carrie and Amy recommend: “Austin Pollack shows us the really cool art of Nashville artist, Herb Williams, whose work is featured all over the world. What really caught my attention was his story of being lost and found through his work after a personal tragedy. Heartbreaking and beautiful.\" -Carrie Sharp \" I loved the Crayon Artist story that Austin Pollack shared on NC5 This Morning at 9. He finds peace and therapy in immersing into his creativity, which helps him deal with emotional pain, I thought his art and his heart were beautiful.\" -Amy Watson",
