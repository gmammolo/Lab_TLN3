  "text": "After a frigid weekend across the state, positive change is on the way temperature wise, but we are preparing for our next storm system to move in bringing heavy snow to the mountains and lowlands by Tuesday.\nLow temperatures, factoring in wind chill, will still be well into the negatives across the Inland Northwest Sunday night and Monday morning – so bundle up and cover any exposed skin when you must head outside. Monday’s daytime high will be around 11 degrees in Spokane, with wind chill values as low as negative 17.\nOur focus this week will be the snow – it’s returning! Winter Storm Watches will be in place Tuesday afternoon through Thursday morning. By Tuesday afternoon, the west side and central part of the state will begin to see snowfall, before the system stretches farther east to our neck of the woods by Tuesday night. Tuesday and Wednesday are the days to watch out for, with total accumulations of seven to 12 inches possible across eastern WA, including Downtown Spokane, and north Idaho.\nThe Cascade passes could see upwards of 18 to 30 inches by the end of the night Wednesday, as well. Difficult travel is expected, with especially dicey commutes Tuesday night and Wednesday morning across the region – so take it slow and be cautious on the roads!\nDaytime highs throughout the week will slowly warm to the 20s, then the mid to high-30s by next weekend. Overnight lows will follow shortly behind in the teens and 20s most of the week.",
