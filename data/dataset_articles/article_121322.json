  "text": "NORTH WOODSTOCK, N.H. – One of New England's most popular winter attractions is opening this weekend.\nThe Ice Castles in North Woodstock, New Hampshire are set to open Saturday.\nThey are opening a week early thanks to the cold temperatures. Ice Castles organizers said they are \"ecstatic\" to be opening ahead of schedule.\nLast year, the castles were forced to open later than anticipated due to an unseasonably warm winter.\nThe interactive experience features ice-carved tunnels, slides, a polar ice bar and towers of ice embedded with color-changing lights.\nTickets are on sale now.",
