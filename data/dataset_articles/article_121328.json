  "text": "Alberta electricity operator ends grid alert after more wind and sun helped system\nEDMONTON – Alberta’s electricity operator says it has ended a grid alert after more wind and solar power helped alleviate the system.\nBut the Alberta Electric Systems Operator says people should continue to conserve power this evening as extremely cold temperatures continue to pose problems.\nThe operator has issued three alerts since Friday, urging residents to conserve power during peak times and warning of the possibility of rotating blackouts if demand gets too high.\nThe operator has partially pinned the crisis on two natural gas generators that weren’t operating, as well as a lack of renewable energy being produced due to low winds and a shortage of daylight at this time of year.\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe have criticized Ottawa’s green-energy plans since the alerts were issued, claiming renewables can’t be depended upon when temperatures drop.\nRandy Boissonnault, the only federal cabinet minister from Alberta and one of only two Liberal M-Ps from the province, called the statements from the premiers “a petty, untrue and partisan attack.”\n ",
