  "text": "FORT SMITH, Ark. — Heartwarming stories hit hard when it's 3 degrees out. Fort Smith business owner Mark Rogers was reminded of \"the importance of not being alone in life,\" when his truck broke down at the intersection of Massard Road and Phoenix Avenue on Jan. 14, in temperatures hovering in the single digits. After rolling his car to a stop on the side of the road, Rogers, carrying a can-do-attitude and some tools in his truck, braced himself for the cold, and popped the hood. He wouldn't have to fight alone, however. In a [social media post](https://www.facebook.com/marknrogers), Rogers tells how Fort Smith Police Officer Shaw pulled up, put his lights on, and offered support. Standing in the \"mind-numbing cold,\" Officer Shaw \"never showed any sign of alarm\" while they worked near the busy intersection. \"He just stood there in the ridiculous cold, helped and encouraged,\" Rogers said. \"Officer Shaw, not just doing his job, but going well past that to help me where he could, exemplifies exceptional service.\" Although the combined efforts of Rogers and Officer Shaw couldn't get the truck running again, Rogers said \"People like him make me proud to call Fort Smith home.\" After Rogers had the truck towed, he offered periodic updates and thanks to Officer Shaw, whose only response \"was to tell me not to worry about it, no problem.\" Watch 5NEWS on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsjInJwm1vIMCeegrZSk_TQ).
