The bulk of the storm hit on Saturday and Sunday, and Buffalo saw clear skies on Monday. But the next issue became about how to prepare the Highmark Stadium for the game. The snow was bad enough that Buffalo [put out a call to fans](https://themessenger.com/sports/buffalo-bills-need-snow-shovelers-to-clear-out-stadium-ahead-of-playoff-game-vs-steelers-after-massive-storm) to come and shovel snow, offering $20 per hour and complimentary food for folks over 18 years to help clear the stadium. Although the shovelers worked all day Sunday to get snow out of the stadium (and took the opportunity to [have some fun](https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/39308932) in the process), the Bills put out an early-morning call for more shovelers on Monday, showing a photo of the field and stands still covered in snow, but with a clear sky.

By the afternoon, the stadium was ready for some playoff football, with the field nearly all cleared off and some sections of the stands (and more importantly, the stairs) cleared of snow as well. Now, as kickoff approaches, Highmark Stadium is ready — and so are the Bills, and their fans. Considering that [Highmark Stadium looked like this](https://themessenger.com/sports/watch-buffalo-bills-post-video-of-highmark-stadium-in-blizzard-after-bills-steelers-is-postponed) on Saturday, it's a minor miracle that the team was able to pull it off.
