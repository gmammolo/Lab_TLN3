  "text": "Longview pastor leads Martin Luther King Jr. Day March despite snowy weather LONGVIEW, Texas (KLTV) - For more than a decade, Pastor Damien Reese has marched on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and he plans to keep the tradition this Monday, despite the winter weather. “There’s a feeling that comes over you when you march,” said Pastor and Event Coordinator Damien Reese. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, he wears a black suit, black tie and white shirt, just like Dr. King did. “I respect his leadership, and I want to emulate his movements, some of his words,” said Reese. He is part of the group that has organized this event for the past 30 years in Longview. “I’m honored to be part of this history because each year I learn something more,” said Reese. The [Longview Area Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance ](https://www.facebook.com/events/1119180259089585?ref=newsfeed)had initially decided to cancel the march due to inclement weather, but after feedback from its members and community, they decided to relaunch it. “It will take something extremely drastic to cancel the march, as long as we are psychically able. God gives us strength and agility to march. I believe we owe it to Dr. King,” said Reese. Those who participate in the march will be given the option to walk or follow behind with a vehicle. This year’s theme is a famous quote. “We want to focus a little bit on leadership, so that those who follow can get in line behind those who lead,” said Reese. Reese will march once again this year, despite the weather, because for him this is a way to honor Martin Luther King Jr. “Each year the importance grows, the importance to march, the importance to be a part,” said Reese. The march is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Monday. For those participating, you can choose to march or drive your car from Broughton Park to Mt. Olive Baptist Church. An interfaith service will take place immediately after inside the church. Copyright 2024 KLTV. All rights reserved.",
