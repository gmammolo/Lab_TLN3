  "text": "More than 60 people help shovel snow at Buffalo football stadium ahead of Bills-Steelers game\n\"I mean, we would shovel a section out, and within, I'd say, half an hour, it'll be back, filled up completely,\" Logan Eschrich said.\n\"I mean, we would shovel a section out, and within, I'd say, half an hour, it'll be back, filled up completely,\" Logan Eschrich said.\n\"I mean, we would shovel a section out, and within, I'd say, half an hour, it'll be back, filled up completely,\" Logan Eschrich said.\nLogan Eschrich went to Buffalo from Alabama to storm chase. He ended up getting stranded in Buffalo and thought, why not stay and help shovel the feet of snow in below-freezing temperatures?\n\"Someone tagged me that the Bills are looking for somebody to help snow shovel. I was like, well, I'll do my shots of camera work and then go shovel snow for the day to help out the local community,\" Eschrich said.\nHe said there were about 60 to 80 people, all working in below-zero temperatures with snow falling at a fast rate. Eschrich said he was out there for about seven and a half hours.\n\"I mean, 4 to 5 inches an hour of snowfall rates and just bitter cold with 45 to 55 mile an hour winds all day. I mean, we would shovel a section out, and within, I'd say, half an hour, it'll be back, filled up completely,\" Eschrich said.\nLogan said the cold was indescribable, but managed to offer this comparison.\n\"Open your freezer up and stick your face in it and just let it sit there for five minutes and you'll feel your nose starts getting like a prickly feeling and you get wind-burned terribly,\" Eschrich said.\nAnd for fans who are still upset about the game being postponed, saying \"It's just snow,\" Eschrich had a message for them:\n\"We definitely were not going to be able to play (Sunday). They probably would have thrown the football and it probably would've flown across the stadium by itself to the other end zone,\" Eschrich said.",
