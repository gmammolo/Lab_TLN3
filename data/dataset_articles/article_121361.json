We will wrap up the weekend with a storm moving in on Sunday...{/p}{p}TODAY: If you're heading downtown to the MLK Day Parade, temperatures will be around 50 degrees at 10 am. Expect partly cloudy skies on Monday with high temperatures reaching 58 degrees in Las Vegas. Winds will stay light out of the north up to 10 mph throughout the day.{/p}{p}Air quality is ranked 'good' for most valley neighborhoods with levels 'unhealthy for sensitive groups' in the east valley. Pollen levels are low.{/p}{p}TONIGHT: Skies will be mostly clear this evening with cold valley low temperatures dropping to around 39 degrees.{/p}{p}YOUR 7 DAY: Temperatures will keep climbing throughout the work week with highs in the low to mid 60s as high pressure builds. A storm will move into the West Coast on Wednesday, bringing rain and snow showers to Northern Nevada. Temperatures will max out around 65 degrees on Saturday in Las Vegas, followed by a stronger storm moving into Southern Nevada on Sunday. A slight chance of rain showers will be possible in the valley on Sunday (about 20% chance) with light rain amounts anticipated. Forecast totals will be anything from a trace up to .10\\\". Mountain snow will be more likely on Sunday but the heaviest snow is forecast for the Sierra Mountains to our west. In between the two storms this week some parts of the Sierra will get up to 30\\\" of snow from now into the start of NEXT week.{/p}{p}Beyond the 7-day forecast, rain shower chances will linger in Las Vegas Sunday through Monday with highs in the 50s.
