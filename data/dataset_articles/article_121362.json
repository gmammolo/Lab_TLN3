  "text": "The Buffalo Bills’ playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers will kick off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Monday. But first, the Bills put out a call for snow shovelers after Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., was buried by three feet of lake-effect snow over the weekend, causing the NFL to push the game back one day, from Sunday to Monday. Anyone who answered the call got $20 an hour and meals. Helpers were asked to bring their own shovels, though shovels were provided if needed. And though it is taking a herculean effort to clear the stadium of all that snow, a good time has been had by all, it seems. “It is all hands on deck. … We’re still looking for more snow shovelers out there,” Andy Major, the Bills’ vice president of operations and guest experience, told WGR radio in Buffalo on Monday morning. “We were hopeful that early this morning we’d get some of our best Bills Mafia fan base to come out and help us out. So yeah, it’s not pretty out there. We got three feet of snow. That [lake-effect snow] band hovered over the stadium the entire time. We were hoping it was going to leave us for a little bit, but it never really did. So it’s a tough one out there, for sure.” Major said the team hoped to have most of the parking lot available for fans but cautioned that some spaces might be lost to snowdrifts. He also said fans might have to deal with a somewhat unorthodox seating arrangement. “The biggest thing is the seating area. The aisles will be as clear as we can possibly make them and have tons of salt on them. But in the seating area, people will be literally walking into some snow and sitting on some snow on their seats,” Major said.

However, that limit was lifted as the team struggled to clear the stadium. The field looks great. The seats? Not so much— Mike DeFabo (@MikeDeFabo) [pic.twitter.com/17wqSF0VSM] [January 15, 2024] The snow got so bad that Erie County put a travel ban in place. But County Executive Mark Poloncarz carved out an exception to the ban on Sunday night so that people could get to the stadium to help shovel it out. Even if the stadium gets cleared of snow, the Bills-Steelers game still will have a wintry feel , with temperatures in the teens and a wind chill in the single digits.
