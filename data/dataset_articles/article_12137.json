  "text": "The Canadian government launched an online visa waiver service for eligible countries in 2015. Citizens of the Czech Republic are among those who do not need a visa to enter Canada for travel, business, or transit. Czech nationals can use the Canadian eTA as an official online travel authorization when visiting Canada. Czech citizens, on the other hand, must apply for a Canada eTA visa if they intend to visit Canada for travel, business, transit, or medical reasons. This visa allows Czech nationals to stay for a maximum of 6 months per visit and is valid for 5 years. When an eTA is accepted, it is digitally linked to the traveler's passport. Those who wish to visit Canada for other purposes, such as study or employment, should get in touch with the Canadian embassy or consulate in their area for more details. Czech travelers who meet all Canadian eTA requirements can start completing the eTA application form online. The form is a simple online questionnaire that takes 20 minutes to complete. Requirements of Canada Visa for Czech Citizens - A valid travel document or passport in order to apply for Canada eTA. - A valid credit or debit card or PayPal account to pay for the Canada eTA. - A valid email address, to receive the Canada eTA in their inbox. Those who already run a successful business in their home country can use the Canadian Business Visa to expand operations or start a new business in Canada. Canada has a plethora of business opportunities. Because of its collection of some of the world's most prestigious cities, developed financial and healthcare systems, and expanding industry, Canada offers excellent business opportunities. Canada is widely regarded as one of the best places in the world to establish a business. Expert entrepreneurs from all over the world are migrating to Canada because of the country's combination of European advantages and a higher standard of living. After having a successful business career in their home country, individuals can expand their current businesses or start new ones in Canada with the help of a special category of visa known as the Canada Business Visa. Your initial length of stay will be determined when you apply for a business visa. The Canada business visa is valid for up to three years and can be extended for an additional two years as long as your business remains active. This period can be extended up to six years. Canada offers a great opportunity for entrepreneurs' businesses. To be eligible for this visa, the applicant must be employed by a Canadian company or work in Canada. DOCUMENTS REQUIRED - A valid Passport & travel history - Background documentation - Documents from your company - A formal invitation from a respected company in the country where you do business is required. - You must have enough money to support yourself and your dependents during your stay. - Documents proving you will not be staying beyond the stipulated time. - Completed application & consulate fees. - Adequate medical insurance CANADA ETA FOR LITHUANIAN CITIZENS The Canadian government implemented this online permission in 2015 to promote foreign travel and visits. Residents of Lithuania and the other 58 countries and territories can visit Canada for a short period of time without a visa. A visa is not required for Canadians to enter Lithuania. Citizens of Lithuania must obtain a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) in order to enter the country. However, if you are a Lithuanian traveling by air, you must apply for a Canadian ETA. You can travel to Canada using this program without obtaining a traditional visa or visiting the Canadian Embassy. Lithuanians must enter Canada with a valid eTA. It allows foreign citizens of select countries to enter Canada for tourism, business, or short-term transit purposes. It is a multiple entry permit, each granting a maximum stay of 180 days. The eTA for Canada is electronically linked to the Lithuanian passport and is valid for 5 years, except for passports that expire earlier. In this case, the Canadian eTA expires at the same time as the passport. Once Lithuanian citizens have confirmed that they meet the eTA requirements, they can proceed to completing the Canadian eTA application form. This is a simple questionnaire that will take you a few minutes to complete. WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED FOR A CANADIAN ETA? - Valid passport – to apply for a Canada ETA, your travel document needs to maintain valid for six more months from your arrival date in Canada. - E-mail – provide a correct email address because we will send your ETA by that email. Besides, we recommend that you print your ETA. - Payments – to pay your request, you can use a credit/debit card or PayPal account. CANADA ETA FOR LATVIAN CITIZENS Latvian citizens wishing to visit Canada must first obtain a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA). The Canadian government introduced the eTA in 2015 to alleviate the complications associated with traditional visas. Canada's visa policy allows citizens of a variety of countries, including Latvia, to cross the border without a visa. The Canadian eTA is mandatory for all Latvian citizens who visit Canada for a short period of time. The Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) is a computerized system that allows certain travelers to legally enter Canada. It is only available to residents of certain countries whose citizens (including Latvians) are allowed to enter Canada for short-term tourism, business, or transit purposes. The Canadian eTA is an online multiple entry visa waiver. It is valid for 5 years and allows Latvian visitors to stay in the country for 6 months on each visit. The electronic travel authorization is linked to the traveler's passport and is not transferable to a new document. This means that if a passport expires before the allowed 5 years of the Canadian eTA, then this travel permit expires as well. Latvians who meet the requirements can proceed to the eTA application form for Canada. This form is a simple questionnaire that takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS? - Valid Passport: You cannot apply for an ETA from Canada if you do not have a valid passport. This document must be valid for at least 6 months from the date of flight. - Email address: You must provide a valid email address as the ETA confirmation will be emailed in PDF format. The ETA is electronically linked to your passport, but you still need to keep a physical copy. - Payment Methods: You can use a credit or debit cards, but you can also use PayPal to pay for the eTA fees. CANADA ETA FOR BULGARIAN CITIZENS If Bulgarian citizens intend to visit Canada for a short period of time, they must obtain a Canadian eTA visa. The Canadian government launched this online visa waiver service for qualifying countries in 2015. It should be noted that any other mode of transportation will necessitate a separate travel authorization. Bulgarian citizens, on the other hand, do not require a visa for leisure, business, or transit purposes. The Canadian eTA applies only to international flights landing in Canada. Bulgarian citizens can enter Canada multiple times for stays of up to six months each by obtaining a Canadian Electronic Travel Authorization. The eTA is valid for five years and is available online. The eTA is electronically linked to Bulgarian visitors' passports and cannot be transferred to a new travel document. This means that if a passport with an approved eTA expires within 5 years, your travel authorization will expire as well. Bulgarians who confirm that they meet the requirements can start the Canadian eTA application process online. The application form is a simple questionnaire that takes less than 30 minutes to complete. CANADA VISA WAIVER REQUIREMENTS FOR BULGARIA - Valid Passport: Your travel document must be valid for six months from your arrival on Canadian territory. - Email address: Please make sure you have access to the email address you provided, as all the information we have about your ETA will be communicated to you through this email. - Payment Methods: You can use a credit or debit cards, but you can also use PayPal account to pay for the eTA fees.
