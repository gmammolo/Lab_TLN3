  "text": "Caitlyn’s Weather Wonders: Extreme cold but beautiful phenomenon MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - Even though we have been dealing with dangerously cold conditions and breezy winds, Mother Nature still reminds us that there is always beauty around us. When you have very cold temperatures, powdery snow that can be easily blown around, and breezy winds, you get beautiful features related to the sun’s light mixing with the blowing snow. The sun’s light interacting with the ice crystals in the air will lead to the formation of some beautiful features that we typically only get to see when it’s frigid, breezy, and snowy outside. The most common features that we see are sundogs, which are rainbow like features located on the right and/or left side of the sun, and the 22-degree halo, which is a halo around the sun that may look like a less vivid rainbow. Sundogs form when sunlight is refracted by hexagonal-shaped ice crystals. And yes, the shape of the ice crystal does matter (the shape indicates that it is very, very cold outside). Once the sunlight hits the ice crystals, the light is then bent 22-degrees as it passes through the ice crystal and reaches our eyes. The bending of that light is what causes the optical illusion we know as sundogs. Sundogs will always be located within/on the 22-degree halo around the sun, though we may not always see the halo, just like we may not always see 2 sundogs. There are many other features that can form due to the powdery snow being blown across/in front of the sun.
