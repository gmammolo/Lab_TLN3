But it can also be done quickly and without an ice scraper. A home remedy helps against icy windows.\nMunich – Winter in Germany is back with Frost-Club and with it the ice scraping on the car again. And while a new rail strike by the GDL in passenger transport begins on Wednesday, many employees will probably have to return to their cars to get to work. In the morning, the temperatures can lead to icy windows again, making the use of an ice scraper unavoidable.\nIce scraping on the car without an ice scraper: A home remedy works wonders for icy car windows But especially in the morning, time is often short and scraping ice on the car is nerve-wracking. But fortunately, a home remedy can help with icy windows, which can work wonders even without an ice scraper. One method is to spread a salt water solution on the car windows with a sponge in the evening. If it doesn't get too cold at night, the salt water makes it easier to de-ice the windshield the next morning.\nIn winter temperatures, scraping ice on icy windows on the car can become a real torture. However, a home remedy and other tricks can provide some relief. © Tom Weller /dpa\nIn order to keep the car windshield free of ice at even lower temperatures, a de-icer spray is also a good preventive measure. This is also very easy to make with home remedies in your own four walls. To do this, pour vinegar and water into a spray bottle in a ratio of 3:1 (three parts vinegar, one part water). If the home remedy is sprayed on the car windows before the night, the windows will remain ice-free at moderate minus temperatures. The trick behind this is that the vinegar-water mixture has a lower freezing temperature than water.\nAnother trick for scraping ice on the car: Warm water can also help with icy windows You can also simply spray the mixture on the icy areas and the frost will disappear in a few seconds. The situation is similar with another trick that can help with scraping ice on the car in the morning: warm water.\nTo do this, however, you need a well-sealable freezer bag into which the hot, but by no means boiling water is filled. Then slowly wipe the bag over the car window and watch the ice melt under the heat.\nBeware of the water method in winter: temperature difference can damage windows Nevertheless, caution must be exercised. The trick with the warm water when scraping ice on the car only works with the bag. Without it, the frost problem could quickly lead to damage. Just pouring boiling water over the icy panes should not be done under any circumstances. The ADAC also warns against this, as well as against a trick with frozen windshield wipers.\nMy news Man Loses Six Kilos in 30 Days – And Gives Up Only One Thing\nMajor spice recall – long-term illnesses can read the following\n\"I'm bursting the a****\": DHL customer freaks out because of dirty transmission slip - and then will read with hostility herself\nHealth card of the health insurance company before the end?

Due to the large temperature differences, cracks can appear or, in the worst case, even shatter the car windows completely. Even lukewarm water could have the same effect.\nScraping ice on the car is mandatory: A small peephole is not enough – fine looms Due to the lack of time in the morning, some drivers are also content to scrape out just a small peephole. But that's not enough. Anyone who does so will be fined ten euros. The view of the remaining windows should also be clear. If this is not the case, the risk of accidents increases.\nIt is also not allowed to warm up the engine instead of scraping ice. Letting the engine warm up while stationary is harmful to the environment, makes unnecessary noise and is therefore prohibited according to §30 paragraph 1 StVO. There is a risk of afine of up to 80 euros plus administrative costs. With these prospects, the appropriate time should probably be planned in the morning for ice scraping on the car, whether with home remedies or without.",
