  "text": "It is very well known by know that there is a lot of snow on the ground in Buffalo as the Bills hosted the Steelers for the Wild Card round of the\nNFL Playoffs. Upstate New York was hammered by a massive three-day winter storm that warranted a state of emergency and dumped more than two feet across the region.\nHighmark Stadium, home of the\nBuffalo Bills, was not the outlier.\nLocal residents were offered $20 an hour to try and clear the stands prior to kickoff. Their efforts helped some, but it was largely inefficient. There was just too much snow in too short of time.\nAs a result, fans were forced to\nplow their way through waist-deep powder to get to their seats like a husky in the Iditarod. One particular image from remarkably talented freelance Kathryn Riley really puts the conditions in perspective.\nBelieve it or not, these two women are actually sitting in their assigned seats at Highmark Stadium:\nThat’s next-level fandom. Dedicated is not a strong enough word to describe the folks who trekked through the snow to watch their team play in sub-freezing temperatures…\nEspecially if you’re going to show up in a full Bills uniform!\nAlthough the field itself was cleared by kickoff, it still qualifies as a snow game and the scenes were epic. The stadium looked like a blizzard as soon as Dawson Knox scored the first touchdown even though there wasn’t any actual precipitation falling from the sky.\nHere is how it looked on the CBS broadcast:\n— NFL (@NFL)\n[#BillsMafia]was made for snow games.\n📺:\n[#PITvsBUF]on CBS\n📱: Stream on\n[#NFLPlus] [pic.twitter.com/XrqPThnCUr] [January 15, 2024]\nIt was even cooler from the perspective of the upper deck.\nPOV video from the touchdown celebration might be the best look. They made it snow!\nTo be a card-carrying member of Bills Mafia requires a passion and dedication that is not shared by many. Incredible scenes on Monday!",
