  "text": "Buffalo Bills fans made the most of a less-than-ideal situation during their team’s playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Bills hosted the Steelers for a Wild Card Round game at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y. on Monday afternoon. The game was originally supposed to be played on Sunday, but it was postponed after a massive storm brought multiple feet of snow to the Buffalo area over the weekend. Though the Bills hired snow shovelers for $20 an hour, there was simply too much snow to clear every seat prior to kickoff. Fans didn’t seem to mind and used the snow to celebrate after Josh Allen found tight end Dawson Knox for an early touchdown. Here’s another angle of the snowball celebration: Some videos that went viral before the game showed how much snow some fans had to trudge through just to get to their seats . Most fans likely embraced the experience. The post Bills fans had awesome snowball celebration after touchdown appeared first on Larry Brown Sports . Want more great sports stories?
