  "text": "Nobody knows how to have fun more than Bills Mafia. And the weather will never affect that. Despite all the snow that fell in Buffalo, with the stands still covered, the place was packed. And when the Bills jumped out to an early lead, they celebrated in style. Snow went flying into the air when Josh Allen connected with Dawson Knox for a nine yard touchdown. View the original article to see embedded media. And of course, some of the snow managed to make its way onto the field. Fans who made their way to their seats were met with tons of snow. But a lot of credit to the crew that was able to dig a path to the seats, allowing fans to fill the stadium. And based on this video, there is plenty of snow for a lot more celebrations. So hopefully that means a lot more touchdowns. Minutes later, the Bills recovered a fumble and despite the officials originally ruling it an incomplete pass, it was later overturned. The snow came out once again. And then one play later, Allen connected with Dalton Kincaid in the end zone, leading to some more snow being thrown. One thing is certain: It's got to be a fun environment in Buffalo on Monday.",
