  "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A search and rescue team saved four students at Red River Gorge on Monday afternoon. Powell County Search and Rescue received a call reporting that four students from Asbury College were stranded atop Courthouse Rock at 9:28 a.m. With temperatures below freezing and snow in the forecast, the students camped overnight and underestimated the weather conditions. They realized they couldn't climb down the terrain because snow had covered the area. Powell County Search and Rescue crews made their way to the students' location and evaluated trail conditions. Rescue officials determined the students could be evacuated via helicopter, so Kentucky State Police were requested. At 2:05 p.m., the helicopter picked up all four students at Courthouse Rock. They were taken to Middlefork Fire Department and then Powell County EMS checked on them. The students were in good spirits after being rescued. \"This rescue had its fair amount of risk to begin with. However, without KSP’s services, the mission would have posed an even larger threat to the safety of the students and our team,\" [Powell County Search and Rescue posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/powell.searchrescue). \"This call was one of the most dangerous rescues ever attempted in the Gorge! Climbing Courthouse Rock is extremely treacherous even when conditions are favorable. Add in several inches of snow, icy rock faces, and a dash of wind; you have the perfect recipe for tragedy.\" Powell County Search and Rescue recommends people planning a winter trip to Red River Gorge to be cognizant of the weather, road and trail conditions.
