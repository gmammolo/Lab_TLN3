  "text": "Volunteers rally to provide warmth and support amid frigid weather in Brazos County BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) -As a chilling cold snap, frigid temperatures, and icy conditions grip the region, many individuals find comfort in warming shelters designed to offer refuge from the harsh weather. Organizers of the warming center in Brazos County say they had an unexpected surge in turnout, surpassing initial expectations. “We exceeded what we had thought was going to be the turnout. We had no idea,” said Warming Center Coordinator Felecia Benford. “We’ve had a lot of calls from senior citizens that some want to come out just because they’re afraid of what might happen, and they don’t want to be by themselves just in case something does arise.” Since Sunday night, dozens of people in Brazos County have sought warmth, comfort, and a safe place to sleep, thanks to the efforts of volunteers, the American Red Cross, and VFW Post 4692. Benford says organizers say they recognized the significant need for a warming center in Brazos County based on past weather events and knew they had to step in. “We just didn’t want to find anyone out and not be able to help them. We didn’t want to find anyone like we see in other cities dead because of this cold weather,” Benford added. Because the need has been so great, more volunteers are needed. Retired Army Veteran Tom Walker has worked two shifts at the warming center so far, and he says it’s been a rewarding experience. “It was an opportunity to serve, and I had nothing else to do that was more pressing, and so it was just an opportunity to meet new people and take care of people in our community,” said Walker. “We’ve been blessed to have enough blankets, enough coats, enough food. We have all that. The only great need we have right now is just manpower. More manpower just to be able to relieve some of the volunteers that are here working 12 hours. We have some that have been here since we opened up,” said Benford. To facilitate assistance, organizers are offering rides to the center. Individuals in need or those willing to volunteer can call (979)-823-0550. VFW Post 4692 will not be the only warming shelter in place. If the power goes out in Robertson County, there are a total of 6 warming centers you can go to. They are listed below. - Franklin Fire Department Station 2 - Pridgeon Center on Cooks Lane - Calvert Volunteer Fire Department - Bremond City Hall - Bremond Volunteer Fire Department - Hearne Police Department Public Safety Building There are also several warming centers opening in Leon County. - Centerville Senior Center - Leona Community Center - Normangee Community Center - Buffalo Senior Center Copyright 2024 KBTX.
