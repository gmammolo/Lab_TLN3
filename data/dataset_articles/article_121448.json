  "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — On Monday, the snow challenged some drivers in Central Arkansas. In some cases, the plows were enough, while others chose to just walk. Though one Arkansan had no trouble at all— on horseback. Starting at his ranch in North Little Rock, Doc Leavy and his trusty steed Champ put an Arkansas spin on their trip to the grocery store. \"Now this is what you call cowboy weather, and I love every minute of it,\" Leavy said, \"Some people do say it's wild but you know this is cowboy life. So doing it in the city ain't no different than doing it in the country.\" And a cowboy at Kroger definitely brought some attention. However, Leavy's real goal wasn't the commute but rather donating his horsepower to cars that might not have enough to make it up the hill. \"I mean his horse is just as strong as the tractor you know. If a car is trying to spin out but you ask them not to spin out, you tell him to just ease on the gas. So he eases on the gas and the horse pulls and they come right out.\" said Leavy as he explained the process. Leavy said he helped a few dozen stuck cars last year. and a handful today. He's a lone rider, in search of stuck ones he can help. \"I try not to charge them, somebody to come through that needs some help,\" Leavy said, \"But if I was in their shoes, I want some help instead of sitting out in the cold, especially if they got kids in the car.\" For now, he's riding the snowy trail home until flurries fall again.",
