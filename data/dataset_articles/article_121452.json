  "text": "MADISON (WKOW) -- The cold is here, and pet owners should do their best to keep their furred friends safe and comfortable this winter.\nThe Dane County Humane Society has several recommendations on how to keep pets safe as the snow keeps piling up.\nFor dogs, keep walks short. If the temperature feels like 20 degrees or colder, DCHS recommends that dogs stay outside for less than 15 minutes. If it feels like it's below zero, that time should be reduced to less than five minutes.\nSome long-haired or fluffy dogs can stay out a little longer, but they'll eventually feel the effect of cold. Once a dog holds one of it's feet up, it's time to bring it inside.\nTo protect pets from frostbite, try to put them in a sweater, coat or booties -- if they'll allow it. There are also balms that can be put on their paw pads to offer some protection from the cold.\nWith less time outside, dogs may get bored and have more energy, so try to find things to keep them busy. Teach them a new trick, fill a frozen Kong with treats or\nbuild them a treat box.\nAlso as temperatures drop, cats may try to hide under car hoods or in a vehicle's wheel well to get some protection from the cold. Before starting your vehicle's engine, DCHS recommends banging on the vehicle's hood to give them a chance to run away. Also check under the vehicle to make sure an animal is under there.\nIf you ever see a wild animal that looks sick or injured, call your local shelter or DCHS’s Wildlife Center at 608-287-3235",
