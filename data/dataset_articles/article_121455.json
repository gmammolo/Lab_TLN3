  "text": "North Somerset Council is taking action to support people rough sleeping as temperatures plummet.\nIn line with the relevant Government and Homeless Link guidance, North Somerset Council has activated its Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP) for rough sleepers in anticipation of the cold snap forecast this week.\nFreezing temperatures are expected for the next few days after the Met Office issued an\namber Cold-Health Alert (CHA) for the south west of England until noon on Friday, January 12.\nThis protocol ensures that the council takes the necessary steps to make sure all known rough sleepers can access shelter if it is believed they are at risk due to sleeping rough during severe or extended cold weather.\nThe council’s Rough Sleeper Co-ordinator and Outreach team have already been out since Monday, January 8 to offer accommodation and support to anyone found sleeping rough. Anyone sleeping rough in North Somerset will be able to access emergency shelter.\nThe council works in partnership with\nSomewhere to Go to provide emergency shelter and support at their premises on the Boulevard in Weston-super-Mare.\nCouncillor Jenna Ho Marris, North Somerset Council’s executive member responsible for homes and health said: “Our housing teams work incredibly hard to bring those sleeping rough in from the streets and settle them into longer term accommodation. I am confident that together with the strong support of Somewhere to Go, along with faith groups and volunteers we can continue this work.”\nAnyone worried about a rough sleeper is encouraged to get in touch with the North Somerset Outreach Service on 01934 629 787 / 07891 809 004 (during office hours). Alternatively, you can call the Homeless Prevention team on 01934 426 330 (Monday to Thursday, 9am to 5pm and Friday 9am to 4.30pm). If you need to speak with someone outside of office hours call 01454 615 165 (Monday to Friday after 5pm / Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holidays).",
