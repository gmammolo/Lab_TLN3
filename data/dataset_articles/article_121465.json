  "text": "Valley animal shelters seeking donations and fosters ahead of cold front Several animal shelters across the Rio Grande Valley are seeking donations to help keep their animals warm ahead of the upcoming cold weather. Temperatures are expected to drop on Monday. The Palm Valley Animal Society is asking for supplies such as self-warming mats, tarps, heaters and propane tanks. The shelter is also asking for fosters, so their animals can have a warm place to stay during the cold weather. Anyone interested in fostering or wanting to drop off donations can visit their location at 2501 W Trenton Rd. PVAS will be open from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. The Rio Grande Valley Humane Society is asking for blankets and bedding donations for the over 100 dogs they have in their outdoor shelter in Mission at 227 Abelino Farias St. They're also seeking fosters. The Weslaco Animal Care Services, located at 1912 Joe Stephens Ave., is also seeking donations for similar items.
