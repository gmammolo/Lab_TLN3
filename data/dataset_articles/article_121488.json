  "text": "Amid Flight Delay Complaints, Man Calls THIS Flight's Crew 'Rockstars' Akshay Chaturvedi, an X user, shared that the six-hour delay was communicated clearly and handled in a \"super incredible\" manner. Chaturvedi mentioned that, out of the six-hour delay, three hours were spent inside the airline, and commendable arrangements were made for ventilation, with the air conditioning working properly. Representative image. Passengers in India have been experiencing significant disruptions in flight services due to adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, leading to extended delays and rescheduling of airline routes. However, amidst these challenges, a passenger recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to express appreciation for the cabin crew of a Vistara flight, describing them as \"true rockstars.\" Akshay Chaturvedi, an X user, shared that the six-hour delay was communicated clearly and handled in a \"super incredible\" manner. Chaturvedi mentioned that, out of the six-hour delay, three hours were spent inside the airline, and commendable arrangements were made for ventilation, with the air conditioning working properly. \"My @airvistara flight today was 6 hrs late, of which over 3 hrs were inside the plane waiting on the runway. BUT, the way they handled the mini-crisis was super incredible! First, 100/100 on honest communication, what’s in their hands and what’s not, apologising profusely, smile on their face. Second, ACs/ventilation etc. were on throughout, not even for a second trying to cut corners from what their standard brand experience is. Third, timed this so to say plane-trap pretty well; food service ran for 45 mins to an hour, then some external safety drill, then something else... passengers start getting frustrated when they see inaction, but this was the simple Indian show-honest-effort-hack... 'ki kuch toh chal raha hai yaar, koshish kar rahe hain.' Never easy being on the other side. Shoutout to Shreshtha, Nikitha, Jyoti on the UK 963 today, you folks are true rockstars,\" he wrote. Chaturvedi's post prompted numerous comments from netizens. Another X user praised Vistara Airlines and wrote, \"@airvistara’s crew is just the best! I flew from Blr to Hyd on Saturday, and our flight faced a delay of 45 mins in Blr due to fog. The way the captain explained the whole situation, apologized for no fault of hers, and reduced the delay from 45 mins to 20 mins in this flight.\" \"At least someone is there to understand & share the other side of the story – Being empathetic & grounded are some of the traits of a right leader,\" another wrote.
