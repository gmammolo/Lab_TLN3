  "text": "Philadelphia finally snaps snowless streak after nearly 2 years It's official, more than an inch of snow has fallen in Philadelphia for the first time in nearly two years!\nPHILADELPHIA - It&apos;s official, more than an inch of snow has fallen in Philadelphia for the first time in nearly two years!\nThe snowless streak was snapped Monday night into Tuesday morning by a s mall system that produced just enough powder to end the city&apos;s longest recorded snow drought.\nA total of 1.5 inches of snow was recorded at Philadelphia International Airport just after midnight, according to the National Weather Service. That total reached 3–4 inches across the city several hours later.\nBefore Tuesday, the last measurable snowfall to blanket Philadelphia was back on January 29, 2022, when forecasters measured nearly 6 inches.\nThe 715-day record far surpassed the city&apos;s second-longest snow drought of 661 days that ended on Dec. 15, 1973.\nFeatured\narticle How long has Philadelphia gone without seeing over an inch of snow? Philadelphia is in something of a snow drought, but forecasters are optimistic it could end this winter.\nBelow freezing temperatures, which felt even colder from blustery wind gusts, helped make the record-breaking snowfall possible.\nThose temperatures will only get colder as the week continues with highs in the 20s expected by the weekend, and another chance of snow possible on Friday.",
