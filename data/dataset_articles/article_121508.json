  "text": "TULSA, Okla. (KTUL) — For those looking to find a warm shelter during these dangerously cold temperatures, organizations across Green Country are stepping up to help those in need. \"It's open to the community, regardless of status. We have heat going on 24/7,\" said Alex Uribe, Assistant Pastor at Kingdom Living Muskogee. With the dangerously cold weather, warming stations across Green Country are answering the call. \"Anytime it's below about 30 degrees, we try to open up and provide shelter for anyone. We have cots,\" said Uribe. One of those warming stations is Kingdom Living Church in Muskogee. \"Right now, we got about 10 people in here. But we were able to house about 100,\" said Uribe. Uribe says it was important to open the warming station after the unfortunate loss of life. \"Last week, we had two people pass from the cold prior to us opening up. So, you know, we just want to ensure that people have a safe, warm place to go. And that no one's suffering through this time,\" said Uribe. Another shelter in Muskogee, the Gospel Rescue Mission, and B the Light Mission in Bartlesville say in weather events like this one, it's important to do what they can for their communities. \"We exist in order to help individuals in our community to flourish, and our community cannot flourish while there are men and women dying on our sidewalks of our businesses,\" said Rich Schaus, the Executive Director of The Gospel Rescue Mission. \"We wanted them all to survive and to flourish,\" said Schaus. \"We give them a hot shower, change of clothes, and give them warm meals and hot coffee and some of them choose to stay and some of them choose to leave,\" said Christy McPhail, Co-Founder of B the Light Mission. \"Those that want to be helped, we're going to be there for them,\" said McPhail. Kingdom Living Muskogee is located at 120 N 24th St. in Muskogee, and you can donate or volunteer at Kingdom Living Muskogee by going to their location. The Gospel Rescue Mission is located at 323 Callahan St. in Muskogee, and you can donate or volunteer by going to their [website](https://www.grmmuskogee.org/), or by calling (918) 682-3489. B the Light Mission is located at 219 N. Virginia Ave. in Bartlesville, and you can sign up to donate or volunteer by going to their [website.](https://b-thelight.org/) Each of these stations is open 24/7. If you want to help, these stations say you can by volunteering or donating.",
