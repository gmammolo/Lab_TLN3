  "text": "DENVER — Now that the Winter Solstice has passed, the Centennial State continues to gain precious minutes of sunlight each day until the Summer Solstice in June.\nThe 5:00 p.m. sunset on Tuesday, Jan. 16, will be the first in the 5 p.m. hour since Nov. 4, 2023.\nThis year, Denver's sunsets will remain in the 5 p.m. hour until Friday, March 8. Two days after that, the clocks will change and Denver's sunset will occur at 7:02 p.m. on Sunday, March 10.\nThe latest sunset of the year in Denver will be June 26 or June 27 at 8:32 p.m.\nOn Tuesday, dangerously cold temperatures rebound back into the 30s , which will be the warmest air in the city since last week. Highs on Wednesday could approach 50 degrees before a weak front moves on through for Thursday and Friday.\nCredit: Michael Ryno Sunset at Daniels Park in Castle Pines.
