  "text": "Mount abu transforms into winter wonderland as freezing temperatures continue\nNEW DELHI: Mount Abu, a hill station in Rajasthan, has transformed into a winter wonderland as freezing temperatures persist, blanketing the town in a layer of ice. The mercury dropped to -1 degree Celsius on Friday, following a chilling low of -3 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The entire town, including fields, vehicles, and hotel gardens, is covered in a pristine white layer of ice. The severe cold has disrupted daily life, with residents delaying their routines until late morning.\nThis sudden onset of piercing cold has presented numerous challenges for the people. The minimum temperature consistently hovers below freezing, and residents are resorting to room heaters and other heating methods to combat the winter chill.\nWeather scientists predict the possibility of another western disturbance that could lead to fluctuations in temperatures, bringing back intense cold conditions. In Sikar district, the mercury plunged below freezing at -0.5 degrees Celsius, forcing residents to gather around bonfires and bundle up in warm layers. Meteorologists warn of even harsher conditions in the coming days. In addition, dense fog conditions continue to prevail in Delhi, leading to low visibility and delays in 39 passenger trains to the national capital.\nVisibility at Delhi (Palam) Airport was reported to be zero, while Safdarjung Airport reported 200m visibility in dense fog conditions. Several parts of Uttar Pradesh, West Madhya Pradesh, Gwalior, Malda, Gangetic West Bengal, Assam, Punjab, and Ganganagar in Rajasthan also experienced visibility below 500m, according to IMD data.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.
