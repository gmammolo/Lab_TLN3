  "text": "Tuesday, January 16: The Kashmir Valley’s scenic beauty has been marred by the dearth of snowfall activity over the region in the last 45 days — leaving both locals and residents bereft. Travellers visiting Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Sonmarg and Doodhpathri have been left disappointed by the absence of snow these places are so famous for. And the locals have even more pressing problems, like water shortage and a dry cold holding them hostage. Unfortunately, immediate respite from the bitter frost seems unlikely, with weather models projecting the ongoing dry spell to continue for almost ten more days, until January 24. However, we come bearing some good tidings today. Wet weather will make a soft comeback in Jammu & Kashmir and its neighbouring areas this week. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a fresh but feeble western disturbance will be impacting the Western Himalayan Region starting tonight, January 16. And under its influence, Jammu-Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh will be in for light rainfall/snowfall activity on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 16 and 17. Similar conditions will prevail over Uttarakhand on Wednesday and Thursday, January 17 and 18. Dense fog will also continue blanketing some of these areas in the morning and night hours of Tuesday. Given these forecasts, a yellow watch has been issued over the region so as to urge people to “be updated” about the wet conditions and foggy weather. As for the mercury levels, no significant changes are likely. Nighttime temperatures have continued to slip in Kashmir, remaining in deep freeze with bone chilling cold on Tuesday. Jammu city continued to reel under unusually low night temperature as people struggled to keep themselves warm. On Tuesday morning, Srinagar recorded -4.6°C, Gulmarg -3.1°C and Pahalgam -5.4°C as the minimum temperature. Leh town in Ladakh region had -10.4°C, and Kargil -12.3°C as the night’s lowest temperature. As we approach the end 40-day long period of harsh winter cold known as the ‘Chillai Kalan’ around January 30, the people of Jammu & Kashmir will experience some relief. Meanwhile, the Kashmir Valley has barely witnessed any snowfall, resulting in a deficit of 79% for the month of December in 2023 and a shortfall of 100% in January 2024 so far. However, the precipitation forecast for January 25-27 is encouraging. According to MeT director Mukhtar Ahmad, there is a possibility of light rain/snow at scattered places from January 25 to 27 as per indications of different models. ** For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download [The Weather Channel App](https://weather.onelink.me/2902176432/ca9eb560) (on Android and iOS store).
