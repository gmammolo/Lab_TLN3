  "text": "WEYERS CAVE, Va. (WHSV) - Farmers across the Valley are ecstatic for the rain and snow coming to the Valley.\nSince summer 2023, farmers in the area have been plagued by a drought. The precipitation deficit has caused many farmers to lose the crops they worked to grow in the last harvest. Some farmers lost all their harvest, leaving them with nothing to sell when it came time.\nBradley Dunsmore is a farmer in Augusta County, and said the groundwater was running very low before rain came through the Valley. Dunsmore added that a good layer of snow to slowly melt into the ground was exactly what farmers needed.\nOn Jan. 15, the snow that blanketed most of the Shenandoah Valley not only made for a pretty sight to see, it will give farmers much-needed moisture in their ground before the next planting season.\n”Rains this time of year, especially when your water tables are low, they really have an impact on the water table. I think you’re going to see the water table really recovering in the next couple of weeks because pretty much all your plants are dormant. Their upkeep of water is not nearly what it would be during the active season,” Dunsmore said.\nCopyright 2024 WHSV. All rights reserved.",
