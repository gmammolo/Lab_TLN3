  "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — When roads got dangerous on Sunday, January 15, 2024, the Mid-South Jeeps Club sprang into action. The group is serving as a free shuttle service for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers.\nMid-South Jeeps said they know how important it is for healthcare workers to get to their patients.\nThe group uses a Facebook group to figure out who needs a ride. From there, they make sure volunteers can get them to and from work.\nJacob Wallace is the Personal Relations and Land Use Officer for Mid-South Jeeps. He said Mid-South Jeeps not only shuttles healthcare workers, but they also help people stuck on the side of the road along the way.\n\"In between giving rides to employees, I'm usually stopping and getting people unstuck or pulling them out of ditches or getting their car back going from wherever they are,\" Wallace said. \"I've saved three people today alone.”\nOn Sunday and Monday, Mid-South Jeeps said they helped more than 100 people.\nRelated Articles Staying safe as bitterly cold temperatures move into the Mid-South Here are what roads are closed in the Memphis area during inclement weather",
