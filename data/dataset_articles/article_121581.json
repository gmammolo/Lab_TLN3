  "text": "The Buffalo Bills had no trouble winning their playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers — but a lot of fans had trouble finding their seats . Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, was blanketed with snow in a storm that caused the game to be delayed a day . The team paid locals $20 an hour on Monday to shovel out snow that was more than 18” deep. Citizen shoveler Bob Isaacs was one of those who helped dig out the stadium seats . He considered the work a contribution to the team. “You got to remember you’re a Bills fan. It’s all part of the deal,” he said. Crews had the turf cleared by midmorning but sections of seats were still covered in snow when fans started arriving two hours before the 4:30 p.m. kickoff. Videos showed people pushing through piles of snow to find their seats for the game. It could have been worse: Neighboring towns saw even higher snow totals, with 41 inches in Hamburg and Angola. The Bills will host another NFL playoff game at the stadium next weekend. The Kansas City Chiefs, who won one of the coldest NFL games ever last weekend, will travel for a 6:30 p.m. game on Sunday.",
