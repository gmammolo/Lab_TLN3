  "text": "Baby, it’s cold outside! And when the winter temps get this chilly, you probably start craving comfort food. If you have a hankering for chili, we know where to go. Here’s where you can find a hot bowl of chili across Northern Virginia.\nBar-J Chili Parlor\nCraving Tex-Mex–style chili? Grab a table at this Occoquan establishment. In business for over 40 years, this eatery has five different chili options, including its award-winning Texas chili, which is made with ground beef simmered in Bar J’s signature hot spices, and Cincinnati chili, made with mild spices. 125 Mill St., Occoquan\nOdd BBQ\nYou’ll come for the barbecue and Ono Brewing beer, but stay for the beef chili. Guests can order a plain bowl or combine it with rice, mac and cheese, or a cheese biscuit. Bowls are topped with shredded cheddar and onions by request. 4520 Daly Dr., Chantilly\nOld Dominion Tavern\nWhile beef-based chili is great, but you don’t want to miss this venison chili. A hot bowl comes with ground venison, beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese, and green onion. 5351 Merchants View Sq., Haymarket\nThe Ashburn Pub\nThe award-winning Pub Chili, which is made using the 2014 Loudoun County Chili Cook-off winning recipe, is a favorite in the region. If you’re looking for a little more substance, order the Chili Mac. The dish combines the Pub Chili with macaroni noodles and is topped with shredded cheese, onions, and tomatoes. Diners can also add pub chili to any entrée for $4. 44110 Ashburn Village Blvd., Ashburn\nVienna Inn\nFor over 60 years, the Vienna Inn has been known for its mouth-watering chili dishes. Options for a bowl include chili with red beans, vegetarian chili, and chili-mac. Chili lovers can also grab a chili or chili-cheese dog, chili cheeseburger, or chili-cheese fries. 120 E. Maple Ave., Vienna\nFeature image courtesy Olde Dominion Tavern\nFor more stories like this,\nsubscribe to Northern Virginia Magazine’s Food & Drink newsletter.",
