  "text": "By Gus Saltonstall Snow enthusiasts rejoice! For the first time in 701 days, more than an inch of snow has fallen in Central Park over the past 12 hours. As of 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, a total of 1.4 inches of snow has been recorded within the iconic Manhattan park. It’s been 701 days since Central Park last recorded an inch of snow on a calendar day. Latest totals as of 7 am: ❄️Since midnight — 1.0″ ❄️Storm total — 1.4″ The streak has ended! [#NYwx] — NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) [January 16, 2024] Current forecasts project two to three inches of snow citywide by the end of the day, meaning that today’s total will surpass the last time there was significant snow in the five boroughs, when 1.6 inches fell in Central Park on February 13, 2022. The record snow drought was a 400-day period that ended on March 21, 1998. There is a winter weather advisory in effect until 7 p.m. in the city, with the snow expected to turn into freezing rain by the end of the day. If you have your own snowy Upper West Side photos, please send them to info@westsiderag.com, and we’ll add them to the bottom of the article. Please specify where in the neighborhood the photos are from. Here are photos of the snow within Central Park on Tuesday.
