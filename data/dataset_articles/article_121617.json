  "text": "2024-01-16 18:33:50\nHOUSTON – The main risk after the passage of an Arctic front over our region seems to have been overcome: the possibility of frozen roads.\nHowever, the intense cold will not leave our region until this Wednesday around noon when the mercury in the thermometer exceeds the 40 degree barrier.\nThis Tuesday, again, a very cold day is expected with maximum temperatures almost at the freezing point (34 degrees) and with a rapid drop at night and early morning to 20 degrees.\nHowever, the thermal sensations will be about 10 degrees lower due to the winds that are felt from the north (20 to 25 mph) and which will remain until around 6 pm this Tuesday.\nEarly Wednesday morning the intensity of the winds will reduce, but they are still expected to range between 10 and 20 mph.\nIf you want to know the weather conditions in real time, Click here.\nThank you for choosing TELEMUNDO HOUSTON.\nDo not use grills or leave stoves on,\n1705431256\n#Arctic #cold #remain #Houston #Wednesday #Telemundo #Houston",
