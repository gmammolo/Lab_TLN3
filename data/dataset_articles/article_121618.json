  "text": "Growing up in South Carolina my whole life, whenever there’s supposed to be a day where temperatures get below freezing, the whole town shuts down. I’m talking about school and business closures left and right, and you can’t walk into a grocery store without the bread and milk aisles being completely ransacked. However, if you live up north, I’m sure a snowy day below freezing is just like any other regular day. In fact, apparently the news stations send out the traffic team for a ride around to discuss the road situation on bad weather days. That appears to be what was going on when FOX29 Philadelphia’s traffic anchor Bob Kelly made the discovery of his life. While Kelly was discussing the road conditions while riding shotgun in the FOX29 vehicle, he noticed that there was one business open… And I’m talking about Lamb’s Beverage, a drive-thru beer and liquor store that you can just pull up to and request what you want. Judging by Kelly’s reaction, you would’ve thought he had just hit the lottery. You can hear him say: “Oh what is this here? Hold on… Is this a drive-thru beer distributor? … You know we’ve been drinking coffee for most of the morning, I’ve gotta get some supplies for later on. So some businesses are open… Lamb’s Beverage, 8 AM to 8 PM Monday through Thursday. They’re ready to go so I’ll bring back some cold ones for you guys how does that sound? … I’ve never seen one of these, you actually don’t even have to get out of your car.” You would’ve thought this guy was in hawg Heaven driving up to this place. Personally, I’ve never seen one of these places either, and I think this needs to start to become a common trend.
