  "text": "With many offices and schools closed following this week’s snowstorm, there are plenty of kids and their parents heading outside to enjoy the first snow day the Baltimore region has seen in years.\nNearly five inches of snow fell across the Baltimore region Monday night into Tuesday. Parents and kids could be seen sledding and tubing at a hill near Ridgley Middle School in Lutherville to celebrate the snowfall.\nIt’s what kids live for. “I like it,” one child said.\nEven parents have been waiting to partake in snow day activities. Jeff Winterling took his kids out to play in the snow.\n“To be able to come here finally after two years and actually sled and hang out with the kids is amazing,” Winterling said.\nTeresa Campanella lives near the school. She was surprised to see the snowstorm overperformed.\n“We were in D.C. yesterday and came home to snow falling,” Campanella said. “It just kept falling overnight. It was great.”\nIt will be cold the rest of the week as temps hover around freezing before another wintry system hits on Friday.\nTalking to kids and parents here enjoying the snow day sledding and tubing at Ridgely Middle School in Lutherville since Baltimore County closed public schools just like many other local systems this Tuesday\nTake a guess about the general consensus: They love it!\n[@wbalradio] [pic.twitter.com/hiXD3yqQYD]\n— Ken Duffy (@kenduffywbal)\n[January 16, 2024]",
