  "text": "Country music star Kane Brown gave some gas station employees a ride home in a snowstorm, according to his wife, Katelyn. \"Kane went to the gas station this morning and has been seeing people working,\" Katelyn shared Monday on her Instagram Story. \"So, he's giving them rides home from work. He gave them his number and told them to call whenever they got off work, and he would give them rides home.\" He followed through on that promise, she said, and Katelyn patiently awaited her husband's return. \"So currently Kane is like the Uber driver of Nashville,\" she joked. Earlier in the day, Katelyn posted a video of Kane in a RZR 1000, a four-wheeler that's able to drive over tough terrains and snow. This weekend's storm doused Nashville in three to nine inches of snow , shut down freeways and airports, and temperatures aren't expected to rise above freezing until Thursday. Last week, though, Kane and Katelyn had something to celebrate. The couple revealed the sex of their third baby. \"Baby boy brown. coming 2024,\" they announced on Instagram with the help of their two daughters Kingsley, 4, and Kodi, 2. Kane is set to kick off the In the Air Tour in Charlottesville, Va., on March 28.",
