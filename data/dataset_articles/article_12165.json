  "text": "Now in its third year, the Catalyst Incubator is described as a unique, cluster-based program that focuses on supporting start-ups in manufacturing, agriculture, technology, energy innovation and related sectors.\nOfficials say the Catalyst Incubator is 100 per cent funded by Carin through Alberta Innovates and is free for all selected entrepreneurs to participate.\nDuring the 8-week group, executives note that each learner/entrepreneur receives more than 50 hours of training from highly qualified mentors. At the final event, each of the five participants gave a 5-minute “pitch” where they provided background about their experience, explained their product, and (most importantly) why investors should support it. . Stakeholders viewed the pitches, asked questions, and provided feedback after the presentations.\nPast Catalyst participant Ben Schultz reflected, “The incubator gave me a window into a whole set of skills and processes for validation of an idea that I've never had to develop before.”\nKathy Forner of C4ner Consulting – Project Manager of the Catalyst Incubator commented, “The Catalyst Incubator is really for early-stage entrepreneurs who want to know what problem they're solving, and who their potential customers are.”\nOfficials say four groups of alumni have already gone through the program so far. A unique feature of the program is that mentors are specifically selected based on the needs of the learners in the group. This is said to allow the program to adapt its expert knowledge to the issues facing the group. Many learners are expected to take their business to market and turn it into a full-time business.\nOfficials say the Catalyst Incubator is currently looking for the next generation of future entrepreneurs interested in the customer discovery journey. The last date to apply is January 11, 2024.\nVisit ca-rin.ca/catalyst-incupator for more information on Catalyst and other training resources for entrepreneurs.\n,\ndownload rdnewsNOW Mobile app on Google Play and Apple App Store for all the latest updates on this and other stories.\nSource: rdnewsnow.com\nSource: biz.crast.net",
