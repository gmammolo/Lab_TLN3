  "text": "YORK COUNTY, Pa. — While some people might’ve stayed inside on Tuesday, kids took advantage of the\nfresh blanket of snow.\nCharlie Poster, a York County student, described the day as one full of chills, thrills, and spills with his friends.\n“You can have fun and be with your friends,” Poster said.\nCarter Gingrich, a high school freshman, took a break from his electronics to take his little brother sledding in Spring Garden Township.\n“It’s always nice to experience some of that outdoor stuff, especially to get a nice breath of refreshing air, and to just see the beautiful scenery and stuff, and release there are better things to do than just sitting on a screen all day,” Gingrich described.\nDylan Wentz believes a\nsnowy day is the perfect time for a friendly sledding competition with pals like Poster.\n“It’s normally the four of us going down and then we sabotage each other, we push them off the sleds, it’s really fun,” Wentz said.\nThe kids described powdered snow as ideal for riding down hills.\n“It’s good for gliding and you just go really fast when you go down in,” Poster said.\nEspecially if you’re a snowboarder like Wentz.\n“The first thing going on in my mind is ‘I’m definitely going to fall, no I’m not going to fall off, okay I got it,’ then I just start going down really fast,” Wentz said.\nTuesday’s snow is expected to melt away slowly over the next week due to persisting low temperatures.\nTo keep up to date with school closings in your area,\nclick here.",
