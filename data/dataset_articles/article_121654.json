  "text": "As expected, the start of October has been quite dry in Colorado – and hot, too. But fear not, powderhounds, a round of snow is on the way. According to [Mountain-Forecast.com](http://Mountain-Forecast.com), October 18 and 19 should bring a bit of snow to some of the higher peaks around the state, including about four inches on [Longs Peak.](https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Longs-Peak/forecasts/4345) That's obviously not a lot of snow, but it's a start, with cooler temperatures expected to emerge that same week, as well. While at least one Colorado resort tends to be open before the end of October, slopes around the state are still lacking snow. That said, resorts are starting to get their snow guns ready to go, set to start firing as soon as temperatures drop to a cold enough level consistently to support their efforts. At this point, the OutThere Colorado team is still hopeful that an October opening will be the case – Arapahoe Basin is one spot to watch closely for potential updates as they're usually a frontrunner on drier years given their higher average elevation. So there you have it – while it might seem like the currently hot and dry October that's underway has no end in sight, that's not the case. Coloradans just have to wait about a week or so for another cold front.",
