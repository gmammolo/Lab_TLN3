  "text": "Colorado’s night sky could be in for yet another light show tonight thanks to the arrival of a severe geomagnetic storm.\nThe aurora borealis — informally referred to as the northern lights — is a natural phenomenon that occurs when particles spewed by solar activity from the sun interact with Earth’s protective magnetic field.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the collision produces light “much like how electrons flowing through gas in a neon light collide with neon and other gasses to produce different colored light.”\nSeveral times already this year the aurora has been visible in Colorado, with the most recent sighting occuring earlier this week . Experts say it’s due to an increase in solar activity .\n“The sun goes through a period of high activity and low activity over 11 years, and we’re in that period of peak activity,” said Bryan Brasher, who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center .\nTonight’s potential for another northern lights sighting is the result of a massive solar flare that occurred on Oct. 8. The flare, a “big flash of light” creating a “tremendous release of energy,” sent billions of tons of plasma hurtling through space at a speed of millions of miles per hour.\n“The question is, ‘Is it directed at us?’ And we believe it to be,” Brasher said.\nThe agency today issued a rare warning to alert power grid operators, satellite and telecommunication companies to prepare for potential impacts to services caused by the storm’s current.\nWhile the agency is anticipating a G4 storm, referring to a four out of five rating on the geomagnetic storm scale , Brasher said he doesn’t expect it will lead to widespread power outages in Colorado.\nAs for the northern lights, Brasher said the best chance for viewing will be at midnight tonight, though it’s uncertain how strong of a show it will be.\nThe pink glow of the northern lights was captured from CR 2020 on Ptarmigan, on an iPhone 12 Pro with a 10-second exposure. Pam Nelson/Courtesy photo “I think there is certainly a higher chance than not that if you are on the Western Slope and you look North that you’ll see the aurora,” Brasher said. “But it could diminish.”\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Zach Hiris said there is also potential for cloud coverage this evening “that is likely going to limit the view somewhat, especially in the High Country.”\n“There’s certainly the potential to see through that,” he said. “But it’s not going to be a perfectly clear night.”\nBrasher said the lights, if visible, will be more faint to the naked eye and could look similar to smoke or haze with a green hue. To capture the best colors, Brasher recommends taking a long exposure photo with either a phone or camera. The less light pollution, the better.\nBrasher said there is a chance the solar storm’s impacts could persist into tomorrow, but tonight will be the strongest chance to catch the light show.\nThe probability of catching the phenomenon will likely remain high for “several years” due to the increase in solar activity, with Brasher adding, “there should certainly be future opportunities through 2025 and perhaps even 2026 to see these in Colorado”",
