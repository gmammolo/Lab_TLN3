Progett’ is back to the club with the guitar virtuoso Paolo Loveri to celebrate Pino Daniele music in an acoustic arrangement. Each note takes us back to Naples… Allería ! Progett’ drifts us directly into the atmosphere of Posillipo, on the steep slopes of the omnipresent Vesuvius and straight to Mergellina beach ! Combining blues, jazz, and Latin sounds – the musical forms that strongly influenced amazing guitarist and singer Pino Daniele, who played with the greatest including Eric Clapton, Wayne Shorter, Pat Metheny, John Mclaughlin, Chick Corea …\nPino, who considered himself a musician first, was a true poet. His lyrics, endowed with a strong evocative power, express the thirst for life and love so dear to the peoples of the South. Allería ! Progett’ performs an onstage reinterpretation and translation of his work in order to make his legacy more accessible to the French- and English-speaking public. Come sing together in napoletano !\nFederica Morelli (vocals),\nFrançois Nys (guitar and arrangements),\nEric D’Agostino (bass), Stephan Pougin (percussions)\nSpecial Guest : Paolo Loveri (guitar)\nBOOKING REQUIRED ! https://themusicvillage.com/event/alleria-pino-daniele-progett-invites-paolo-loveri-2/ Advertisement Event Venue & Nearby Stays The Music Village - Jazz Club, Steenstraat 48, 1000 Brussel, België,Brussels, Belgium\nTickets Find Tickets Discover more events by tags: Music in Brussels Entertainment in Brussels Art in Brussels Literary-art in Brussels Live-music in Brussels Sharing is Caring:",
