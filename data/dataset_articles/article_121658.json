  "text": "Northern Lights visible tonight, stellar end to the week Cold air looms for next week, however 7 hours ago Geoff Bansen ,\nThe Northern Lights are going to be visible for much of the northern tier of the US tonight, including here in our own backyard!\nA strong geomagnetic storm is responsible for a night that could rival the stunning displays we witnessed back in May.\nIt will be very nippy out though! Temperatures will fall through the 40s tonight. By tomorrow morning, some of us could be waking up to upper 30s!\nWe have incredible weather lined up for the next two days. Full sunshine is expected, with upper 60s Friday and low 70s Saturday.\nUnfortunately, things go downhill real fast into Sunday. A warm front will move into the Northeast, and depending on exact placement, temperatures may not get out of the 50s!\nIt will naturally also be bringing rain along with it, especially into the afternoon. Rain chances continue right into Columbus Day, with some improvement by the afternoon.\nDry and blustery conditions will build in for Tuesday and beyond, as will colder temperatures. Days will remain in the 50s, and nights will drop in the 30s!\nAs a result, we could see our first frosts of the year for some during the middle of next week.\nCategories : News , Weather Forecast Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin",
