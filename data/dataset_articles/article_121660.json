  "text": "Under mostly clear to partly cloudy skies, temperatures will gradually fall into the 50s during the evening. This will mean great sky conditions for the chance of seeing the northern lights. Northern Lights A G4 geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for Thursday and Friday, which makes it the strongest since May. In areas away from city light pollution, the best chance to see the northern lights will be from 8 p.m. to midnight. The solar storm could stress “power grids already weakened by the hurricanes,” according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. The remnants of Milton will continue to move away from the U.S. over the Atlantic. Overnight lows will be in the lower to mid 40s in Southeast Michigan. The cooler temperatures will be near Ann Arbor, Howell, and Lapeer. Friday Friday will be partly cloudy with the return of warm weather. Afternoon temperatures will top out in the mid 70s, which is around 10 degrees above average. A fire weather watch will be in effect for Sanilac County in Southeast Michigan from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Friday. The watch will also cover the Saginaw Bay region and Northern Michigan. Dry, warm weather with gusty winds will elevate the fire risk. Winds will be out of the southwest at 10 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph over the Thumb. Nighttime temperatures will be in the upper 40s to lower 50s. Saturday Cooler air will flow into Metro Detroit on Saturday behind a cold front. A couple of showers will be possible, especially at night. Highs will be in the mid-60s, and lows will be in the mid-40s to 50 degrees. Sunday Sunday will bring a better chance of rain showers. Highs will be in the lower to mid-60s. Lows will be around 40 degrees. Monday Then, cooler air will push into Southeast Michigan on Monday. With a chance of showers, highs will only be in the mid-50s, which is typical of late October and early November.
