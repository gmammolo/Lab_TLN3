  "text": "By Devan McGuinness ,\n2 hours ago\nHurricane Milton reached the state late on October 9, 2024, and one pup took the opportunity of the additional rainfall to get in a good, leisurely swim.\nAccording to a funny video, a Golden Retriever was set on swimming, and it's very much a mood. Take a look!\n@kimberlyclark78\n♬ original sound - Kimberly Clark Golden Retrievers are known for being pretty positive pups, but for one dog mom, her Golden Retriever was overly optimistic when maybe that wasn't the best course of action.\nRelated: Golden Retriever 'Showing Off' Seahorse Toy to Neighbors Is the Picture of Innocence\nTikTok user Kimberly Clark (@kimberlyclark78) shared a video of her adorable Golden Retriever (dangerously) enjoying the extra rain.\nIn the video, we get a pan of Kimberly's yard, and you can tell the weather is gearing up because of the hurricane. It's dark, dreary, rainy, and doesn't look like someone would typically want to be outside. But Duke is different.\n\"Duke!\" the person behind the camera yells just before the camera finishes panning to the backyard pool. Then, we can see what Kimberly is talking about. Duke, a Golden Retriever, is in the middle of the pool.\n\"We're in the middle of a hurricane, and here you are, in the pool,\" his mom shouts at him. He doesn't seem bothered at all, nor does he seem rushed to get out of the water.\n\"The wind is crazy,\" Mom says. \"I let you out to go pee before work ... and look.\"\nMom then attempts to convince Duke to get out of the water. \"Hurricane Milton is going to get you,\" she tells him. \"You have got to get out. This is craziness.\"\nStill, Duke was not in any rush to get out of the pool and instead started swimming around.\n\"Now is not the time to leisurely swim around the pool; come on,\" she pleads with him again. She explains that she \"purposely let you out the front door,\" likely so he won't be tempted to get in the pool. But the Golden Retriever does what the Golden Retriever wants to do.\nBy the end of the video, she still hadn't convinced her pup to get out of the water. And people in the comment section had a good giggle at the silly dog.\nOne wrote, \"They way he looked to see if Trevor was really on the way. Awww duke is adorable. I hope you’re all safe.\"\nAnother shared, \"That’s a true Floridian. Milton can wait. Throw Duke a floating bed and puts some 80’s music on.\"\nSomeone else added, \"He like we may not have this pool later so let me get one last swim.\"\nOne shared, \"He’s like, 'Milton who?'\"\nAnother TikTok user explained, \"The fact that dogs can sense storms, and he does not give a damn.\"\nDo Golden Retrievers Like Water? It sounds like Kimberly did what she could to discourage Duke from getting into the pool when she let him outside to do the washroom. But even though she let him out the front door, he still knew that pool of water was right in the backyard, and he went for it.\nThis is typical Golden Retriever behavior because these pups love water. According to Wag! , this dog breed really loves the water.\n\"Golden Retrievers are also known for their instinctive love of water and craving for outdoor activities,\" the site explains.\n\"Whether it is the beach, the river, a lake, or your own swimming pool, this type of breed will definitely enjoy splashing around when temperatures go high,\" the site adds. And as Duke shows us, it could be in the middle of a literal hurricane and your Golden Retriever may still head to the water to play.\n\"Make sure you don’t leave them unattended when they’re out in the water and keep away from strict training methods, as Goldens don't respond well to harsh tones and discipline.\"\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
