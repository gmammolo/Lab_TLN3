  "text": "DUBUQUE, Iowa (KCRG) - Several groups in Dubuque are teaming up to send water to hurricane victims in Florida. Resources Unite, the Dubuque County Fairgrounds, and the Dubuque Speedway are raising money to buy pallets of water for people in need. “We thought, ‘We’ll pay it forward,’” said Dubuque County Fairgrounds General Manager Kevin Kotz. “We all have great sponsors, people that have been supporting us for as long as the fairs been going on. We need to help those people where they’re at. The basics of just water even is sorely needed. We’re big on paying it forward out here at the fairgrounds and that’s what we want to do.” After launching the initiative Thursday morning, the Dubuque County Fairgrounds told TV9 its raised nearly $2,000 as of 5:18 p.m., which is enough money to send about 16,000 water bottles to Florida. The goal is to reach 20 pallets, or enough water to pack a semi-trailer by Friday night. People interested in donating can learn more on the Dubuque County Fair’s Facebook page . Copyright 2024 KCRG.
