  "text": "By Nikita Mahato ,\n29 days ago\n(Photo Credit: Saul Martinez | Getty Images) A viral video from Hurricane Milton, which recently struck Florida, shows two coworkers rescuing a cat and giving her a safe space in their car. Christopher Salas and David Barcenas saved a cat named Millie near FGCU in Ft. Myers during a heavy downpour and later dropped her off at a pet hospital. They believe she “may have slipped away from her home” during the storm. Barcenas then wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that Millie would have a home with him in D.C. if nobody adopted or claimed her after the storm.\nRescuers share update on cat via X Christopher Salas’ cat rescue video quickly went viral on X, showing the two men saving her from Hurricane Milton in Florida. The short yet heartwarming clip shows Salas and David Barcenas offering the cat, Millie, a safe space after removing her from underneath their car, where she had sought shelter. The video shows the two coworkers taking the feline inside the vehicle to save her from the heavy rains.\nSalas captioned the video, “We’re a three man crew now” before explaining that they rescued the cat after someone informed them that they had heard “meowing.” The Good Samaritan then shared another photo of Millie, describing her as “understandably skittish” as she rested “under the car seat.”\nLater, David Barcenas shared an update on the rescue cat and details about her. Barcenas posted a selfie of him, Millie, and his coworker on X with the caption offering crucial information about the cat. He wrote, “Millie is an adult female cat we found up near FGCU near Ft.Myers FL.” He claimed to have “dropped her off at the Blue Pearl Pet Hospital where they confirmed she does not have a microchip.”\nThe two men also mentioned that the rescue cat “does not seem to be feral” and called her “well mannered.” Moreover, they observed that “she may have slipped away from her home.” The caption continued that Millie will be moved to Lee County from the pet hospital once the devastating storm “subsides.” Concluding that he misses her already, Barcenas even proposed to take Millie to D.C. with him if nobody claimed her once the adoption process began.\nThe post Cat Finds Safe Space in Rescuers’ Car During Hurricane Milton appeared first on CatTime .",
