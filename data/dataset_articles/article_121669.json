  "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - So long Milton, hello fall! Finally fine fall weather has arrived across SGA. Friday lows about 5-10° below average low-mid 50s. Enjoy a sun-filled Friday with pleasantly warm mid-upper 70s.\nRather chilly upper 40s Saturday morning then sunny with highs upper 70s. Just as nice Sunday lows low 50s give way to sunshine and seasonably warm low 80s.\nThe dry stretch extends into next week with warmer mid 80s on Monday. However, a cold front tracks south Tuesday with an even cooler airmass which drops highs into the low 70s then upper 60s on Wednesday. The fall chill drops lows into the mid 40s on Thursday. Despite an abundance of sunshine the little warmth the rest of the week with highs around 70° and lows upper 40s.\nIn the tropics, there’s a low 20% chance for development of a disturbance along the west coast of Africa over the next 7 days.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
