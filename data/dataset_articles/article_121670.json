  "text": "Significant changes to follow for the weekend ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - The Stateline’s been the beneficiary of some positively gorgeous weather in October’s first week and a half. Bright sunshine dominated once again Thursday allowing temperatures to reach the middle 70s for a third consecutive day. Speaking of the sun, a severe, G4 Geomagnetic Storm took place earlier in the day on the sun, sending a Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME, in the direction of earth. While these storms can have impacts on power grids and GPS infrastructure, the most noticeable effect is the increased ability to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights. Once there’s been a geomagnetic storm and a CME that follows, we begin to pay attention to something called the Planetary K Index (Kp). For us to see the Northern Lights in these parts, we’d like to see a Kp Index of at least 7. As of late Thursday afternoon, the Kp Index sat at 8.33, which would be more than sufficient for us to see Northern Lights tonight into early Friday morning. Current forecasts suggest Kp Index values remaining above 7 until 4:00am Friday, and near or above 8 through 1:00am. So, if you’re in the mood for what could be another great light show, head out of town, far from any lights, and try to get a glimpse for yourself! Thankfully, there won’t be any clouds around to impede our viewing. Sunshine will be around to start the day Friday, but more cloudiness will gather as the day progresses. However, gusty southwesterly winds will work to our advantage, allowing temperatures to surge into the 80s despite the additional cloud cover. Winds may gust at times to 25mph in the afternoon. The combination of gusty winds, warm, dry air, and a worsening drought situation still poses a somewhat worrisome threat for fire danger, particularly Friday afternoon. Considering that now nearly 85% of the Stateline is in Moderate Drought, any fires that do ignite will spread rapidly. A cold front will pass through Friday night, shifting winds back to the northeast, and perhaps touching off a sprinkle, but no more than that. Saturday will feature more in the way of cloud cover, but won’t be entirely void of sunshine. Still, with easterly winds blowing for most of the day and a sprinkle possible here or there, temperatures will struggle mightily compared to Friday. Still, the 71° forecast high temperature Saturday will still come in well above normal for this time of year. Sunday’s the day we’ll see even more significant changes. As northwesterly winds howl during the day, much cooler air is to arrive from Canada. The 63° high temperature forecast for Sunday, while likely being the coolest of the month thus far, would actually still come in right around October 13 normal levels. Things get even cooler to start next week. We’ll have high temperatures in the middle 50s both Monday and Tuesday with lows near freezing those night. Frost is to become likely at that time, meaning we’ll need to start thinking about bringing in or covering our sensitive plants. Milder times are to follow. Temperatures may return to the 70s by Thursday and 80s aren’t out of the question by the end of next week. Copyright 2024 WIFR. All rights reserved.",
