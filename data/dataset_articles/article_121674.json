Aurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the magnetic poles.\nIn the northern hemisphere, most of this activity takes place within a band known as the aurora oval, covering latitudes between 60 and 75 degrees.\nWhen activity is strong, this expands to cover a greater area - which explains why displays can be occasionally seen as far south as the UK.\nThe visibility of the Northern Lights was increased on Friday because of an \"extreme\" geomagnetic storm, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\nThe phenomenon appears as beautiful dancing green and purple ribbons of light that have captivated people for millennia.\n11 The Northern Lights on display in the skies over Felixstowe, Suffolk Credit: PA 11 Whitby Harbour was also lit up by beautiful hues Credit: News images 11 The Northern lights were even seen in Haringey in London Credit: LNP\nAuroras – how do they work? Here's the official explanation from Nasa...\nThe dancing lights of the auroras provide spectacular views on the ground, but also capture the imagination of scientists who study incoming energy and particles from the sun Auroras are one effect of such energetic particles. These particles can speed out from the sun from giant eruptions known as coronal mass ejections or CMEs and solar flares, explosions of radiation on the sun. After a trip toward Earth that can last two to three days, the solar particles and magnetic fields cause the release of particles already trapped near Earth, which in turn trigger reactions in the upper atmosphere in which oxygen and nitrogen molecules release photons of light The result: the Northern and Southern lights.
