  "text": "1-minute read A geomagnetic storm forecasted for parts of the country on Thursday and Friday night is resulting in a majestic display of colors in the night sky. There were reports of northern lights being seen all over New Jersey on Thursday. The NWS in Mount Holly reported seeing the northern lights on Thursday, there were posts from all over North Jersey on social media seeing the spectacle - even Gov. Phil Murphy saw them! What are the Northern Lights? A coral mass ejection (CME), which is an eruption of solar material and magnetic field, erupted from the sun on Wednesday evening and the effects may last on Thursday and Friday evening, according to the NOAA. A G4 solar storm watch was issued by the NOAA on Tuesday, the first one since May of earlier this year. Story continues below photo gallery The green and red lights known as the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, may be on display for states further north such as Washington, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Even though New Jersey is not listed, some residents from the Garden State were able to see the Northern Lights this past week before the geomagnetic storm took place. This past May , some residents from New Jersey were lucky enough to witness the display from the last geomagnetic field. The best time to view the Northern Lights are typically the light night hours between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. according to the NOAA. Those who wish to see the spectacle can have the best viewpoint with \"an unobstructed view toward the north.\" The New Jersey Astrology Group , who reported sights on the Northern Lights earlier in the week, are posting what may be the best areas to see the aurora borealis.",
