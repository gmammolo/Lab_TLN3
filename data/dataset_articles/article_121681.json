  "text": "If you took a look up at the sky in Lancaster County on Thursday night, odds are you were treated to a colorful sight. The northern lights were visible across several areas in the county, as well as York County. The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, were likely a result of a severe solar storm that prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to issue a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday into Friday after an outburst from the sun was detected earlier this week. The storm could temporarily disrupt power and radio signals, even as the U.S. deals with major back-to-back hurricanes. Hues of purple, blue, green and red can be visible across the sky during such events. It can be difficult to see with the naked eye, but they become easier to see using a phone camera. Forecasters do not expect the latest solar storm to surpass the one that slammed Earth in May, the strongest in more than two decades. But they won't know for sure until it's just 1 million miles away, where spacecraft can measure it.",
