  "text": "UPDATE (Thursday Afternoon) - Latest observations from the Space Weather Prediction Center show that G4 storm conditions have reached Earth at 11!:57 a.m. CDT on Thursday. Forecast call for these strong geomagnetic storm conditions will persist into tonight, with a potential to reach G5 levels. The last time we saw G5 levels reached was back in May when vibrant auroras were visible across much of the United States. A strong solar flare and corresponding [coronal mass ejections](https://www.spaceweather.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections) (CME) are expected to impact the Earth Thursday into Friday, October 10-11. According to NOAA's [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/), the forecast calls for potential G4 storm conditions and a G4 storm watch has been issued for the second time since 2005. The last time was May of this year when brilliant displays of the Northern Lights were seen across the United States. Based on current forecasts, it's likely that the Northern Lights will be quite active across the northern United States Thursday night If you want to be able to see them, you'll need to get away from city lights and be patient. The lights are not visible throughout the night and may come in waves. Earlier this week, there were two intense bursts that happened Monday Night at 9:30 PM and again just before Midnight. And before you head out, make sure forecasts are calling for clearer skies! You can check the latest [StormTeam 3 Forecast here](https://www.kimt.com/weather/).",
