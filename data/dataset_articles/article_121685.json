  "text": "The northern lights made a rare Illinois appearance on Monday, Oct. 7, and lit up social media. But the colorful, dancing, atmospheric light show's sequel could be even better. Social media was abuzz with reports of the Monday light show. The Northern Lights Illinois Facebook page includes accounts and photos from Chicago, central Illinois and elsewhere. The US National Weather Service Central Illinois Facebook page also posted pictures from Monday. But Ed Shimon, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service branch in Lincoln, said the best may be yet to come. \"The big show will be Thursday night,\" he said. \"Get your tickets now,\" he joked. Peak Illinois viewing could begin as early as 9 p.m. and continue until 3 a.m. Friday morning, he said. Overnight on Thursday, Oct. 10, another \"powerful\" northern lights display is expected, Shimon said, possibly extending as far south as Alabama — a \"highly unusual\" occurrence. In Illinois, he predicted \"brilliant colors,\" cloud cover permitting. \"It looks pretty good\" for a multicolored display, he said. Friday into Saturday may offer a lesser display, he added.

The northern lights are a type of aurora , a natural light display caused by disturbances in the Earth's upper atmosphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, these displays are called aurora borealis, aurora polaris, or northern lights. Normally, these natural light shows are only visible at higher, more northern, latitudes. During geomagnetic storms, they can appear farther south, including Illinois. The northern lights can appear as green, pink, purple or blue rays, sometimes with a red border. Can you see the northern lights tonight? Shimon expects a lesser experience on Wednesday, Oct. 9. \"A little bit of a break,\" he said, before Thursday. The northern lights are expected to be most visible in Illinois on Thursday, Oct. 10, into Friday, Oct. 11. How to view the northern lights The best time, of course, is after sundown. The best place is in dark spaces, away from city lights. Camera tips for the northern lights Don't be discouraged by what you see at first, Shimon says. Sometimes, your camera - even on your phone - will capture the beauty of the lights better than your eyes. \"Your camera will almost always capture the image of the lights better than your eyes can see them.\" More: Illinois community among best places to live, according to Money.
