  "text": "Residents of Karachi experienced some relief from the sweltering heat on Thursday as brief showers, accompanied by strong winds and a hailstorm, swept through various parts of the city, creating a more pleasant atmosphere. Earlier in the day, the city was grappling with intense heat when dark clouds began to gather, leading to rainfall and hail in several areas. Regions affected by the windy and rainy weather included Malir, North Karachi, Bufferzone, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, and Shah Faisal. Steel Town, Gulshan-e-Maymar, and Port Qasim also experienced rain and gusty winds, with speeds reaching 40 to 50 kilometers per hour near the airport. Hail was reported in areas such as Johar Block 1 and Safoora. Following the rains, electricity supply was disrupted in several neighborhoods, including Abul Hassan Isfahani Road, Scheme 33, North Karachi, Malir, Model Colony, Gulshan-e-Hadid, and Ahsanabad, as over 150 feeders were affected. The highest rainfall was recorded at University Road, measuring 30.5 mm, while Jinnah Terminal reported 1 mm and Old Airport recorded 6.2 mm. The K-Electric announced that temporary power shutdowns would occur in some areas as a precaution. Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz noted that cloud formation was due to the heat and could impact other parts of Karachi for approximately half an hour, particularly in the north and northeast. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) previously stated that Karachi's weather was expected to remain hot over the next four to five days, with temperatures projected to reach between 38°C and 40°C.
