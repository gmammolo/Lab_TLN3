  "text": "MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - Our “fair weather friend” also known as High Pressure will dominate our weather now through the start of the weekend. This means you can expect more fabulous weather for your Friday and Saturday plans. Our mornings will stay cooler than the average into the low 50s. Afternoon highs will remain warm and comfy with low -mid 80s expected. By Sunday, a southerly wind will return ahead of an approaching cold front. So, highs will manage to reach the upper 80s. Monday, the cold front will arrive and actually cross our area. This front won’t bring much in the way of rain, but it’ll be stronger than our previous cold front. Behind it, we’ll tap into some even COOLER air that’ll truly bring the “fall” feel to our area. FIRST ALERT- Coolest Air of the Season thus Far Starting Tuesday, highs will stay in the 70s. By Wednesday morning, we’ll have temps in the widespread low-mid 40s. This will definitely put a chill in the air, and 40s are expected each morning for the rest of the week. It looks like temps will warm back up closer to the average by next weekend. Looking for rain? It’ll be hard to find any through the end of next week. This isn’t good because there are a few spots in our area that still sit under a Moderate Drought based on the latest Drought Monitor. Our area hasn’t had a single drop of rain all month. Forecast models are hinting at the possibility for a few showers by next weekend. Stay tuned to our First Alert Weather Team for updates. Click here to subscribe to our daily newsletter!
