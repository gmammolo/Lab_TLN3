  "text": "FIRST ALERT WEATHER: The nice stretch continues HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT) - After seeing another picture perfect day across Eastern KY, the stretch of nice weather continues as we head into the weekend. YOUR FIRST ALERT Your First Alert has everything lit up in green meaning conditions are great for the next 24 hours. DISCUSSION This forecast discussion can pretty much start like how it started the past few days where we had another picture-perfect fall day across Eastern Kentucky with highs in the upper 60s and low 70s. This will pave the way for clear skies again for the overnight hours with lows dropping into the low to mid 40s. Some places could drop into the upper 30s for overnight lows. The same tune will play again for Friday until we get into the weekend. This weekend will provide a little *gasp* of Summer with highs going back into the mid to upper 70s with lots of sunshine. Some places could even make it into the low 80s Get out and enjoy the nice weather because after Sunday, we are talking about cooler air. We will be keeping an eye on another cold front that will push through Eastern KY as we head into Sunday evening and going into Monday Morning. This isn’t just a weak front that will drop the temperature a couple of degrees and call it good. This one means business as we go from highs in the mid to upper 70s for this upcoming weekend, to highs in the upper 50s and low 60s. Overnight lows could easily dip into the upper 30s.
