  "text": "PHOTOS: Northern Lights visible across South Carolina skies COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - A geomagnetic storm is causing the skies of South Carolina to light up in beautiful pinks, blues and purples. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center called tonight’s storm a “severe” geomagnetic storm. This solar storm is the most severe [since the one on May 10](https://www.wistv.com/2024/05/11/calm-after-storm-midlands-covered-beautiful-auroras/), where the aurora borealis were seen across the state. The best way to possibly view the Northern Lights tonight is to get away from city lights and look towards the northern horizon between 8 to 12 p.m. You might need to use you phone’s camera in night mode with a long exposure time to capture the lights here in the Midlands. - MORE DETAILS: [Northern Lights could appear over the Carolinas Thursday night](https://www.wistv.com/2024/10/10/northern-lights-could-appear-over-carolinas-thursday-night/) - Do you have a photo you want to share with us?
