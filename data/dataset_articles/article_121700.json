  "text": "By Audrey Cooney ,\n46 minutes ago Sky gazers shared pictures of brilliant pink and green skies in Scituate and Marshfield.\nThe Northern Lights were visible in Scituate, Mass. on Oct. 10, 2024. Marc Choquette The Northern Lights dazzled on Thursday night, with the colorful phenomenon visible in eastern Massachusetts.\nExperts with the Space Weather Prediction Center said an intense geomagnetic storm caused the lights, also called the aurora borealis, to appear farther south than is typical. The lights were also visible in parts of New England earlier in the week .\nSky gazers shared pictures of brilliant pink and green skies on the South Shore and North Shore Thursday night.\nThis week was the second time in recent months New Englanders got a glimpse of the Northern Lights. In August , they lit up the sky in parts of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island during an appearance that reached as far south as Texas.\nShare your photos of the Northern Lights Did you take photos of the Northern Lights?
