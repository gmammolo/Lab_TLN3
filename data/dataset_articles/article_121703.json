  "text": "- October 17, 2024 Loading Sarasota Memorial estimates its staff sheltered more than 4,000 people before, during and after Hurricane Milton between its downtown hospital campus, Venice hospital and freestanding ER in North Port. The head of the health system says the hospitals \"stayed busy\" and \"fared well\" throughout the storm, caring for everyone from those injured in the hurricane to four-legged family members to medical evacuees. “We had an influx of patients as the storm headed our way and hospitals around us began closing and evacuating patients,” David Verinder, CEO of Sarasota Memorial Health Care System, says in a statement. As Hurricane Milton approached the west coast of Florida, [Sarasota Memorial had 2,500 staff members lined up](https://www.businessobserverfl.com/news/2024/oct/09/sarasota-hospital-milton/) to stay multiple nights for the duration of the storm. “They reported for duty on Tuesday evening and helped provide care and support for more than 1,000 patients and medical evacuees,” Verinder says in an Oct. 10 statement. “And today, they continued to care for those who were injured or who developed serious medical conditions during the storm.\" Sarasota Memorial also delivered seven babies during the storm, according to Verinder. It was not business as usual at the hospitals and ER, which hosted more than just its regular patients. Among those receiving shelter and care at Sarasota Memorial were patients evacuated from surrounding hospitals, medically dependent people assigned by the county, physicians, staff and some of their children and pets. Dogs, cats and a bunny that provided emotional support for a nervous dog rode out the storm at Sarasota Memorial, officials say. \"We couldn't be prouder of our team,” Verinder says. “They left their homes and many left their families to be here for our patients and community during one of the most alarming hurricanes approaching the Suncoast.” A new wave of staffers began arriving Thursday as road conditions allowed to relieve the initial response team, Sarasota Memorial officials say. “Thankfully, our facilities fared well, despite heavy winds, rain and surges nearby,” Verinder says. “Both hospitals are on high ground — our Sarasota campus at 19 feet and our Venice campus at 16.5 feet.” Sarasota Memorial Hospital plans to open its seven urgent care centers and network of outpatient imaging centers and physician offices as electricity, water and services become available. As of 11 a.m. on Oct. 10, only the Heritage Harbour Urgent Care Center had [reopened, while all others were being assessed](https://www.smh.com/hurricane). The goal is to be open across all sites by Monday, Oct. 14, officials say.",
