Many of our WFMY News 2 viewers are sharing their amazing photos of the Aurora (Northern Lights) with us. Take a look!\nQuite the View!

Credit: Breanna Doss What causes the Northern Lights? The Northern Lights can be seen when energy from the sun moves toward Earth and interacts with our magnetic field. The result is the bright color you may see in pictures.\nScientists track these bursts of energy from the sun, called Coronal Mass Ejections, and they've spotted a big one that will arrive this evening.\nThese solar storms can put on some really good displays of Aurora, the technical term for the Northern Lights. That means there may be a chance to see them even here in the Carolinas on Thursday evening.\nCredit: WFMY news 2 Northern Lights from Lake Townsend in Greensboro Thursday.

There are a few things to keep in mind if you're trying to see the Northern Lights.\nGet away from city lights as best as you can. The darker the better! Take a look between 8pm and Midnight. That's the forecasted time of most activity with this event. Allow your eyes time to adjust. Look north! Use night mode on your phone, or long exposure on a camera. It can see more than your eyes can by letting in more light over time. Keep expectations low, and be patient. Sometimes the Aurora comes in waves. Predicting the Aurora is much harder than predicting the weather. Lots of times it doesn't pan out, especially this far south.
