  "text": "Once again, I could not be more pleased to say that Brevard County is in pretty good condition after Hurricane Milton made its way across the state of Florida. While there were some parts of the county that saw some significant damage, along with limited ongoing power outages, our citizens all appear to be safe and that’s all that matters. With us once again being blessed to have minimal impacts to our community, earlier this afternoon members of our Hurricane Response Team packed up for round 2 and headed over to the west coast to assist Sheriff Chad Chronister and the men and women of the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. While it seems they were spared in some aspects, with less than expected storm surges, they are still dealing with significant devastation and power outages after Hurricane Helene and now Hurricane Milton. Our team will again partner with local law enforcement and other agencies who have come from around the state to work on search and rescue efforts, along with helping to re-stabilize the area after this massive storm. There are not enough words to thank these dedicated men and women of our agency that continuously step up to help out in times of need!! Please join me in not only thanking them for their efforts, but to pray for their safety during this deployment and also all of the communities that were impacted by this storm. – Sheriff Wayne Ivey",
