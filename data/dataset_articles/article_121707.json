We have added it to a list of your favorite stories.\nYou may want to take a peek at the sky after dark Thursday night.\nA severe geomagnetic storm is pummeling Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center has issued a severe geomagnetic storm alert.\nThe K index peaks at 9 and is running at 8.3 as of late Thursday afternoon.\nIf the storm continues after dark it could be a great aurora show above Minnesota. Auroras are fickle to forecast because the magnetosphere must interact with inbound solar energy in the right way to produce auroras.\nTurn Up Your Support\nMPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\nAs of this post, auroras are already occurring in much of Europe after dark. So keep an eye out anytime after dark in Minnesota. Best viewing is always away from city lights with a good view of the northern sky.\nYou may also be able to catch a glimpse of the comet C/2023 A3 Tsuchinshan-ATLAS low in the western sky just after sunset.\nGood luck!\nCooler days ahead\nA series of cool fronts will bring freezing temperatures to most of Minnesota by Monday morning.\nExpect widespread frost and freezes early next week!",
