  "text": "Stargazers could be in store for a spectacular show Thursday night. A coronal mass ejection - a large cloud of energized and magnetized plasma ejected from the sun - reached Earth on Thursday. The northern lights were already on full display in darker parts of the world. When these sun outbursts are directed toward Earth, they cause geomagnetic storms which disturb Earth's magnetic field. Severe geomagnetic storm (G4) conditions were observed Thursday afternoon and will remain possible Thursday night. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center, there is even a possibility the storm will reach extreme (G5) levels. So what does this all mean? Severe to extreme geomagnetic storms are capable of impacting communication satellite systems, power grids, and GPS services. FEMA has been informed this could disrupt recovery efforts for Hurricane Milton. If the storm's intensity remains at a G4, the northern lights may be visible low on the horizon or with a high exposure camera in South Carolina. If the storm intensifies to a G5, then it is more likely the northern lights will be visible to the naked eye in the Palmetto State. Those rare G5 conditions were met earlier this year on May 10th, resulting in a rare northern lights display over the Midlands. The sun has been more active this year as it nears the peak in its 11-year solar cycle. Those hoping to catch a glimpse in South Carolina can expect clear skies Thursday night. Your best chance at seeing the northern lights will be at locations away from city lights. Smartphones set to night mode can often capture what our eyes can't see.",
