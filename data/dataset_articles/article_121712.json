  "text": "Following more than four inches of snowfall at Babusar Top, located at the junction of the Kaghan Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan, the weather has turned pleasant, with cool breezes and snow-covered peaks welcoming visitors at an elevation of 13,700 feet. The silver-tipped mountains, a beautiful blend of sunshine and clouds, create a mesmerising atmosphere that leaves tourists in awe. The recent snowfall has enhanced the beauty of the Babusar Pass and surrounding valleys. After the snow ceased, the weather became exceptionally pleasant, attracting snow enthusiasts to enjoy the crisp air and stunning scenery. The Babusar Pass also serves as a route for tourists traveling to Gilgit-Baltistan, providing an easy and picturesque journey along the Karakoram Highway. Babusar Top, also known as Babusar Pass, has been a vital transit route since ancient times. Tourists visiting Babusar Top have expressed that the views after the snowfall are breathtaking, with snow-capped mountains creating a picturesque landscape. However, the temperature at Babusar Top remains below freezing point. COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
