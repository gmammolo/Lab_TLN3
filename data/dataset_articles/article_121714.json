  "text": "Heads up sky watchers! Zip up your jackets and get your cameras ready! Tonight may be the best opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis also known as the Northern Lights from right here in Maryland! The Space Weather Prediction Center has G4 (Severe) Geomagnetic Storm Conditions ongoing and expected through tonight. The solar storm is what causes those dazzling colors in the sky that are usually visible closer to the Arctic Circle. The huge solar storm will make the auroras larger, brighter, and visible further south than normal. With clear skies tonight, this will be the best chance to catch them starting right after dark through the early morning hours! The last couple of times we had a solar storm of this magnitude we were unfortunately overcast so they were not visible from the ground. Go find a safe, dark area away from city lights, look to the north, and you may be lucky enough to experience one of the most incredible sights on earth. In addition to the Auroras, solar storms have impacts on earth such as disrupting some satellite communications, and making some power grids more unstable. Thankfully precautions are often taken to protect those high tech systems to minimize impacts from solar storms the same way protections can be set up to protect properties from floods. How exactly do solar storms cause the Aurora (Northern Lights)? Watch the video above for an explanation. Good luck, Aurora Hunters!",
