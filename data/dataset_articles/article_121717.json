Dozens of News 8 viewers shared photos of the northern lights. Check out some of them in the gallery above. What are the northern lights? The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are a captivating phenomenon characterized by colorful dancing waves of light in the sky. When there is a strong enough geomagnetic storm, the aurora can be seen in Pennsylvania. During these storms, charged particles collide with gases in the earth's upper atmosphere, producing the spectacle. The stronger the geomagnetic storm or larger the amount of material ejected by the sun, the farther south the northern lights can be seen during a storm.
