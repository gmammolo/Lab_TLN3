  "text": "FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WFFT) -- Friday offers us one more warm day before we begin to settle into some Fall-like weather next week. High temperatures peak near 80 degrees Friday afternoon with a southwesterly breeze under plenty of sunshine. We remain a bit warmer overnight with low temperatures falling to the mid 50s under increasing cloud cover. A slight shower chance exists Saturday night, although our best chance for rain comes overnight Saturday and into the day on Sunday. We also see temperatures starting to fall across the region with high temperatures in the lower 70s on Saturday. Sunday is mostly cloudy with dwindling shower chances and high temperatures in the upper 60s. The real shakeup in our forecast comes at the start of next week. It will be time to bust out the warm clothing as high temperatures stay in the mid-to-upper 50s Monday through the middle of the week. Overnight, you will want to turn the heat up and bring outdoor pets inside as we face low temperatures in the mid 30s with wind chill values creeping towards the freezing mark. We continue to stay cold overnight throughout the remainder of our forecast period. A partly cloudy sky lingers for the first half of our workweek, before we trend towards the return of plentiful sunshine and above average temperatures by the end of the week.",
