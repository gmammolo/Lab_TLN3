  "text": "As Hurricane Milton neared the western edge of Florida, where it would make landfall was uncertain. It wiggled and wobbled north, northeast, and east, slowly moving northwards of Southwest Florida, but leaving area residents on the dirty side of the storm. For those on the barrier islands, those thin slices of sand that used to be home largely to mangroves that would protect mainland Florida from the worst of the winds and waves, now popular tourist destinations and home to thousands, this was bad news. But on Pine Island, one popular Facebook group serves as a lifeline to many. Kevin and Jen Russell, the unofficial mayors of Pine Island, are also the administrators of the Facebook group Things to Do on Pine Island, a vital line of communication with residents during storms. Ian gave them a crash-course in how to vet info, keep in touch with sources, and disseminate information during a major hurricane. Now? They're pros. Jen, a former radio news director, runs the operation similar to a newsroom or an emergency operations center alongside Kevin. \"I think Ian really got us trained up for this kind of stuff: information in, information out, how to verify,\" Jen said. \"With the network of people we have providing information, we really know what we're doing now.\" They've sourced information from friends, neighbors, and residents they initially connected with through their Facebook group, in addition to more official sources, such as the Pine Island / Matlacha Fire District. As the years have gone by, and the hurricanes gotten more devastating, Things to do on Pine Island has become a go-to site for getting and sharing information. 'Fireflies' dance on electrical wires during Milton By early Thursday, it was clear Pine Island and Matlacha did not emerge from Milton unscathed. Forecasters had predicted Lee County would see 8-12 feet of storm surge as Hurricane Milton headed eastward, and nowhere is storm surge more precarious than on Florida’s barrier islands. On Pine Island and Matlacha, Florida's largest barrier island, the surge hit worst in the early hours of Thursday morning, when the tide was at its peak. The waters flooded over roads, lifted boats from their moorings and even knocked down a three-story building: a restaurant initially damaged during Ian. Residents also reported seeing what Kevin referred to as “fireflies” on the power lines and transformers, and flashes arcing off the same. The Russells shared a video one of their sources sent them of what looked like a transformer, red- and white-hot sparks dancing all over it. Those pops of light and color were not necessarily transformers, she said. \"It could be a transformer or a fuse, a protective device,\" said LCEC Public Relations Manager Karen Ryan. \"There could be sediment or salt contamination on the power lines. That will cause it to arc and what happens is whatever is on the lines, it will burn off. When it arcs like that, it looks like sparklers, a bright light, popping noises.\" Also, she said, tree branches touching the lines can cause an arc. Milton damages include fires, collapsed buildings At least one fire took place overnight, said Jen, who had spoken with the Matlacha / Pine Island Fire District, though it is not clear what sparked it. Ryan could not say for certain it wasn't an LCEC powerline, but, she said, she was doubtful. \"When a line is de-energized, it’s probably not going to create a fire because there’s no electricity in it,\" Ryan said. Most of Pine Island lost power during the storm, according to electrical company LCEC. Their power outage map showed that 99% of the island was sans power before midnight Wednesday. \"That's when the dirty side of the storm was hitting us,\" Ryan said. The district posted photos of a large fire, with flames reaching 20 feet high or more, to its Facebook page. According to Russell, the fire department said it took place around 2 a.m. Thursday. There were no reported injuries, she said. There were downed power lines on Stringfellow Road, as well. The fire district could not be reached for comment. “Crews made access to the island a few hours ago and are responding to several calls including structure fires,” the district wrote on its Facebook post. “Please stay off the road.” Too, the old Hooked Island Grill building collapsed further during Milton, blocking Pine Island Road overnight. While the road is now clear, the fire department has asked that only islanders return, in order to keep the roads clear for emergency responders as needed, Russell said. The Hooked Island Grill on Matlacha was initially severely damaged in Hurricane Ian. The local chain, with outlets in Fort Myers and Cape Coral, had planned to repair the building and return. A Facebook group turned lifeline Through it all, reports came in to the Russells, who, in turn, verified the info and posted what was necessary to their Facebook group. They even set up a walkie-talkie app they used during Ian, too, to communicate with residents when cell service went down. “People have no idea what is happening,” said Jen. So they turn to each other for answers. So often, sharing information on the Things to do on Pine Island Facebook group during massive storms like Milton leads to an answer to questions, a solution to their problems.
