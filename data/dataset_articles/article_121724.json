  "text": "ATLANTA — Believe it or not, the [northern lights](/article/weather/northern-lights-possible-over-georgia-tonight/85-8caec653-eaee-471a-a7ff-c3c12f944dac) were back over north Georgia on Thursday night! A phenomenon that is rarely seen this far south has now made two appearances in the Peach State here in 2024. But what is causing this? It is because there is a G4 geomagnetic storm reached the earth today. That is from a coronal mass ejection from the sun a couple of days ago. As this energy makes it to the earth, it disturbs the magnetic field, which can sometimes allow visibility of auroras in the sky. If you look north in the sky and see faint hues of red, purple, pink, or green -- that is the northern lights. Those in the state are sending in their magnificent photos of the northern lights in the clear, starry skies in Georgia. Keep sending in your photos on the 11Alive Weather Impact Facebook page or by using the \"Near Me\" section on the 11Alive app. Let's take a look at all the photos being sent in from 11Alive viewers across the northern part of the state:",
