  "text": "Northern Lights visible on horizon across Kansas WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - Update: The Northern Lights are again visible on the horizon across the Sunflower State with Kansans sharing views of the colorful curtain in the sky. For the second time this year, a rare G4 storm watch has been issued by the Space Weather Prediction Center. The last time it happened was in May, when most of the country witnessed the Northern Lights. A Coronal Mass Ejection, or CME, is an eruption of solar material and magnetic fields, and one is directed to hit Earth possibly late Thursday night, bringing another chance to see the Northern Lights across Kansas. The window of opportunity to potentially see the Northern Lights on Thursday night will be between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. You’ll want to get away from the city lights and use a long exposure setting on your camera. Sky conditions Thursday night will be mainly clear, but the moon is at a first-quarter phase, which will add some light pollution to the night sky. Copyright 2024 KWCH. All rights reserved.
