  "text": "(KNSI) — When the clouds finally parted over the mountains in North Carolina, a woman from St. Cloud stepped up to comfort her neighbors and rescuers. Debbie Newcomb spent most of her youth in St. Cloud and graduated from Tech High School. She and her husband, Rob, moved to Alexander, NC, about 11 miles north of Asheville, in 1988, where they built a home and a life. That all changed in late September when a massive rainstorm met the remnants of Hurricane Helene, leading to torrential rainfall. Rob told KNSI News the landscape has been forever altered. “The pictures and video footage that you’ve seen on TV don’t show the true magnitude of the damage and the destruction.” The deluge led to 500 mudslides, which sent trees crashing all over the mountain and washed out nearly 300 bridges. The Newcombs say they were relatively unaffected, aside from the loss of 40 trees, thanks to a home generator, solar power, a well and a portable internet unit. After making sure their friends and family were safe, Debbie told KNSI that since they had been spared by the wrath of the weather, they knew they had to help whoever they could. “We brought water to people. We brought other supplies. I had excess food and brought that down. And during the day, I invited some people to come out here and use my house for whatever. And so people were coming and going and doing laundry, and that’s kind of been going on since the beginning.” While parked in a mountaintop clearing to use the internet on behalf of neighbors who couldn’t communicate with their loved ones, the couple saw a car drive up with a family whose ten-day-old baby was in distress. The family was waiting for a helicopter to take the child to a hospital. While the Newcombs waited with them, a crew of eight Florida State Guard Special Operations members showed up to help the chopper land and take the child to safety. Debbie opened her home to the rescue squad and was able to host them for several days, along with two members of the Florida Fish and Game Department. The members stayed at Debbie’s house until they were called back home to deal with Hurricane Milton. “And so we said farewell to them, but I will tell you, these people, in a matter of days, have become like family to me, and they will forever be my heroes.” Recovery efforts are still underway as officials search for missing people. Numerous neighborhoods are still dealing with downed trees on houses. It could be four to six months before power is completely restored to rural mountain communities. The region is working on reopening schools by the end of the month. ___ Copyright 2024 Leighton Media. All rights reserved.
