  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — A strong geomagnetic storm is impacting earth Thursday night, and this is producing beautiful views of the northern lights across northern portions of the United States. Due to the strength of this geomagnetic storm, faint views of the northern lights are even visible right here in Central Texas through long exposure photos! Below is the view from Coupland, Texas in Williamson County from Thursday evening. The northern lights were also visible through long exposure photos just north of the KVUE area in Temple, Texas! Here in Central Texas, the northern lights are very unlikely to be visible to the naked eye. However, if you look to the north low on the horizon and take a long exposure photo on your phone or camera, there is a chance you might be able to see them northern lights faintly. Again, it is not a slam dunk that you will be able to see the northern lights, even through photographs here in Central Texas. The best chances will be north of Austin and away from any bright city lights. Best of luck!",
