  "text": "A powerful solar eruption is heading toward Earth, bringing with it the chance for a rare and stunning aurora borealis display over much of the northern hemisphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, one of the most severe classifications, as the storm is expected to hit Earth by midday Thursday. As a result, northern lights may be visible in regions far beyond their usual range.G4 Geomagnetic Storm Watch Issued by NOAANOAA has been tracking a coronal mass ejection from the sun since Tuesday. This ejection, a burst of plasma and charged particles, is expected to interact with Earth's magnetic field, potentially causing disruptions to power grids, GPS signals, and satellites. Despite these risks, the event could provide a unique spectacle for aurora chasers. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center has issued the rare G4-level storm watch, the second time this year such a warning has been given.Forecasters use a five-level scale to categorize geomagnetic storms, with G5 being the most severe. A G4 storm, according to NOAA, is just one step below the most intense classification. The last G4 storm, in May, marked the first such event since 2005. That storm was powerful enough to cause electrical grid disturbances and interfere with navigation systems. However, it also gave rise to stunning views of the aurora borealis in areas where the phenomenon is not usually visible.Extended Aurora Visibility Across the U.S.Geomagnetic storms like the one expected Thursday night can push the visibility of the auroras much farther from the poles than usual. NOAA has indicated that the storm’s strength will likely make the aurora visible across much of the northern U.S. At these levels, aurora may be seen directly overhead from the northern states, NOAA said in a statement, highlighting that the Kp index of the storm is 8, indicating very bright and active auroras.Based on the Space Weather Prediction Center’s experimental Aurora viewline, those located in Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin are in the best positions to see the northern lights. The auroras may even reach as far south as Alabama and northern California, depending on local weather conditions and city light pollution.The University of Alaska at Fairbanks’ Geophysical Institute has also stated that auroras may be highly active in regions like Nevada, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and North Carolina during the storm.When and How to Catch the Best ViewAuroras form when charged solar particles get caught in Earth’s magnetic field and interact with atmospheric gases, causing glowing colors like green and red to appear in the sky. NOAA recommends skygazers try to view the auroras within an hour or two of midnight for the best chance, provided the weather is clear. The agency has an aurora dashboard to help track the phenomenon in real-time.The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, have fascinated humans for millennia. When these solar particles collide with Earth’s atmosphere, they create brilliant displays of rays, spirals, and flickers that captivate viewers. Thursday's storm could offer such a spectacle to people in regions unaccustomed to seeing this natural wonder.Solar Cycle 25: Increased Solar Activity AheadFor those who miss this event, there will be more opportunities in the near future, as solar activity is expected to increase. NASA has projected that the sun will reach the peak of its current solar cycle, Solar Cycle 25, in 2025. As the sun moves toward this peak, more sunspots are expected to form in areas of intense magnetic activity. These sunspots can release energy in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can lead to more geomagnetic storms and auroras.NOAA explains that when these ejections collide with Earth’s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting the planet from space weather, they produce geomagnetic storms. These storms enhance the visibility of the northern lights, allowing them to be seen further from the poles than usual.This week’s storm may disrupt communication systems, but it also presents a rare chance to view the aurora borealis across the United States. For those hoping to catch the northern lights, Thursday night could be one of the best opportunities this year.",
