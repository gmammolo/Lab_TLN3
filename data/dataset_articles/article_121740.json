  "text": "INDIA’S monsoon season, which runs from June to September, has again been wetter than average, which is excellent news for the country. Plentiful rain is, of course, of vital importance to agriculture. It also fills the dams used for hydro power and gives the whole economy a boost.\nhttps://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/rainfall_time_series.php\nReuters reports: ‘India’s monsoon rainfall this year was its highest since 2020. India’s annual monsoon provides almost 70 per cent of the rain it needs to water farms and replenish reservoirs and aquifers, and is the lifeblood of a nearly $3.5trillion economy. Without irrigation, nearly half of Indian farmland depends on the rains that usually run from June to September.’ https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/indias-monsoon-rains-hit-four-121413615.html\nThe last drought was in 2015. By far the worst series of droughts occurred between 1960 and 1990, and these were a direct consequence of global cooling at the time, something which climate scientists in those days knew well.\nIn contrast, global warming between the 1920s and 40s brought plentiful rain for India.\nhttps://mol.tropmet.res.in/monsoon-interannual-timeseries/\nThese facts may come as a surprise to anybody who watches the BBC. Not only have they failed, as far as I can see, to report this good news, they even had the temerity two years ago to report that India’s monsoons were drying up! But good climate news does not suit their agenda.\nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220517-the-uncertain-fate-of-asias-monsoons\nThe reason for the catastrophic floods in North Carolina\nhttps://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153387/devastating-rainfall-from-hurricane-helene\nLAST week I wrote about the impact of Hurricane Helene on Florida. https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/the-climate-scaremongers-hurricane-helene-was-bad-but-nowhere-near-the-worst/ As I mentioned, there was also considerable flooding inland, particularly in North Carolina.\nThe US National Weather Service (NWS) have now published full data on the floods there, and it is important that we understand their message.\nThe rainfall from Helene, which by the time it got inland had degraded to a tropical storm, largely impacted the western part of the state around the town of Asheville, which lies amongst the Blue Ridge mountains. According to NWS, Asheville itself received 13.98 inches over three days, and over the higher ground totals of more than 20 inches were recorded in a few places.\nSuch rainfall totals seem incredible to people living in Britain, but are not uncommon where tropical storms are concerned. Hurricane Floyd, for example, dropped 19 inches on Wilmington, NC in 1999, before proceeding to break rainfall records in South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New York.\nFloyd hit the low-lying eastern half of North Carolina. Helene in contrast hit the mountainous area, which meant that water quickly cascaded into the river valleys, exacerbating the flooding. But the biggest factor with Helene was that the storm was trapped over Asheville for three days because of atmospheric blocking. Rainfall there amounted to about four or five inches each day, which as we have seen is not exceptional in itself; cumulatively however it was.\nThe flooding around Asheville was not unprecedented either. In July 1916, even more devastating flooding hit exactly the same part of the state, after 22 inches fell in 24 hours, which is still a record for the whole of the US, following a hurricane which had made landfall at Charleston.\nI would thoroughly recommend looking at the historical account of this disaster, which can be read here. It begins: ‘The flood of 1916 broke every record in the book. The death and destruction it caused in Western North Carolina defined flooding for an entire generation of survivors, and their stories live on nearly 100 years later. ‘\nThe photos alone tell the story.\nUnsurprisingly many in the media have jumped at the chance to blame the severity of the floods on global warming. But this is not supported by the facts. It was not the intensity of the rain which caused so much devastation, but the fact that the storm was stuck there for three days instead of quickly moving away.",
