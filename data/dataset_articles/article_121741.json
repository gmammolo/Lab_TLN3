  "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Hurricane Milton has dissipated, leaving the skies clear for this weekend.\nAccording to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, a “severe” G4 geomagnetic storm watch is underway, which is forecast to last through Friday.\nRecommended Videos\nSince the level will be an eight, the Aurora Borealis could be seen as far south as Central Florida.\nWill it be seen?\nAccording to our sister station WKMG , if the Aurora is visible, the sky will be red and very low to the horizon.\nWhen will it happen?\nThe geomagnetic storm will be strongest on Thursday evening, with the highest chances of seeing it, gradually dropping this weekend, according to University of Alaska researchers .\nEarlier this year, a G5 geomagnetic storm caused the Northern Lights to be seen as far south as South Florida. While the storm isn’t as powerful, there are low chances that it will reach as far as Central Florida.\nTypical viewing for geomagnetic storm conditions What are the Northern Lights?\nThe Northern Lights, referred to as the Aurora Borealis, is a natural light show that occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with the gases of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, giving the sky a dance show with either green, blue, pink, red, or violet in it.\nThe best time to see the Northern Lights is between August and April, with October and November being the Peak times. The best time to see them is at 10 p.m.\nCopyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",
