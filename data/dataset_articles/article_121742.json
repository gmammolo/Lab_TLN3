Hollister conducts a fire district study Central Coast American Red Cross volunteers prepare to take off to help those impacted by Hurricane Milton By Nataly Gutierrez today at 6:53 PM Published October 10, 2024 4:29 PM HOLLISTER, Calif. (KION-TV): As Hurricane Milton made landfall overnight, volunteers from the American Red Cross on the Central Coast were getting ready to leave to Florida.\nFor the past seven years, John Crepeau--Hollister resident--has been volunteering at the American Red Cross. He said the people of Florida need all the help they can get during this challenging time.\n\"It's an eye opener,\" said Crepeau. \"I can relate to it, personally. I've had situations like that myself, I know what it looks like.\"\nCrepeau said he was supposed to drive the American Red Cross truck to Florida on Friday, but he received a call on Thursday that he was going to catch a flight instead. The American Red Cross said that there are currently enough trucks in Florida.\nCrepeau said when he gets to Florida, his role will be to give out food.\n\"I will be feeding people that have been displaced,\" said Crepeau. \"Most likely in shelters, but we have a vehicle, that is like a food truck, a mobile food station.\"\nCrepeau said he's been able to help people impacted by hurricane Harvey, the wildfires in Lahaina, Hawaii, and now Hurricane Milton.\n\"I enjoy volunteering,\" said Crepeau. \"It's very rewarding, sometimes challenging, but it's very rewarding, and the people are so thankful.\"\nCrepeau said he will be in Florida for two-to-three weeks.\nThe American Red Cross said seven people who live along the Central coast will be helping those people impacted by Hurricane Milton.\nArticle Topic Follows: Central Coast american red cross CENTRAL COAST hurricane milton Jump to comments ↓\nNataly Gutierrez Related Articles 65 thousand in overtime was given to Monterey County Sheriff’s Office during winter storms Santa Cruz County proposing cut to Community Bridges funding Santa Cruz County releases its 2024 Community Health Assessment Plan 1 dead and several injured after a hydrogen sulfide release at a Houston plant BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION KION 46 is committed to providing a forum for civil and constructive conversation.\nPlease keep your comments respectful and relevant.
