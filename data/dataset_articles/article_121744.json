  "text": "As Hurricane Milton churned in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward Florida this week, the warnings from officials were dire.\nGov. Ron DeSantis warned people who intended to ride out the storm in coastal areas that “Mother Nature is going to win that fight.” Mayor Jane Castor of Tampa told residents “you are going to die” if they did not evacuate. The National Weather Service said the hurricane could be the worst to hit the Tampa Bay region in more than a century.\nOn Thursday, as Hurricane Milton moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean, officials and residents credited those warnings for getting people out of harm’s way. “We know lifesaving measures did make a difference,” President Biden said.\nWhile waiting for a bridge to open and allow traffic back into Fort Myers Beach on Thursday, Jacki Liszak, the president of the town’s Chamber of Commerce, said she was focused not on the triple-whammy punch of Hurricanes Ian, Helene and Milton, but instead on what had gone right during this latest storm.\n“When I write the script to this movie, nobody is going to believe it,” she said. “It’s insanity. But we’re going to take this as a win.”\nMs. Liszak, also a beach resident and business owner, said coordination among the town, Lee County and essential service providers was “night-and-day different” from the chaotic days in October 2022 after Hurricane Ian , which killed more than 100 people.\n“I’m thrilled,” Ms. Liszak said. She had worked with the fire department to compile residential contact lists and to check in with those who had stayed, which she estimated as a few hundred, including employees at the resorts that stayed open. Most people who had lived through Hurricane Ian followed last weekend’s evacuation orders.\n“Folks did a good job listening to the warnings,” Ms. Liszak said.\nJeff and Jennifer Rogers, both 60, chose to remain at their home in Port Charlotte, but they had family members from closer to the water come stay with them.\nMs. Rogers said she believed the early warnings made a difference, noting that she saw other residents preparing for the storm three or four days in advance, rather than waiting until the last minute.\n“Locals took this one more seriously,” she said.\nDuring the hurricane, the National Weather Service continued to push out warnings for those who had stayed behind. The Weather Service office for the Tampa Bay area issued a flash flood emergency on Wednesday night , warning those in Tampa and St. Petersburg to move to higher ground. An extreme wind warning was also issued for the area, which urged residents to shelter as if a tornado were approaching.\nRoss Giarratana, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Ruskin, Fla., said that meteorologists were monitoring conditions during the hurricane with the goal of giving residents an hour of lead time before dangerous winds or rising waters arrived.\n“It’s kind of like a warning within a warning,” Mr. Giarratana said. “We hope that that’s lifesaving information for them to take action.”\nAt a news conference on Thursday , Mayor Castor thanked those who heeded warnings.\n“I’m quite certain that that saved, if not lives, a lot of injuries,” she said.\nThe post Dire Hurricane Warnings Got Floridians’ Attention, Saving Lives appeared first on New York Times .",
