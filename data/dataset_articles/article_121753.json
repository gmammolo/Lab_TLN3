  "text": "Seven Babies Were Born at Sarasota Memorial Hospital During the Hurricane While [Hurricane Milton](/microsites/hurricane-milton) raged outside, Sarasota Memorial Hospital campuses in Sarasota and Venice, as well as the healthcare system's freestanding emergency room in North Port, stayed busy inside with an influx of patients as the storm neared—including those who were evacuated from nearby hospitals. Although forecasters called for between 9 feet to 13 feet of storm surge, both SMH campuses were built on high ground: the Sarasota campus is 19 feet above sea level and the Venice campus is 16.5 feet off the ground. \"We couldn't be prouder of our team. They left their homes and many left their families to be here for our patients and community during one of the most alarming hurricanes approaching the Suncoast,\" David Verinder, CEO of Sarasota Memorial Health Care System, said in a press release. \"They reported for duty on Tuesday evening and helped provide care and support for more than 1,000 patients and medical evacuees. Today, they continued to care for those who were injured or who developed serious medical conditions during the storm.\" As road conditions began to improve throughout Sarasota County today, SMH's relief team began arriving to relieve the storm response team. All in all, SMH estimates its staff cared for and sheltered more than 4,000 people at the two hospitals and ER, including patients, medically dependent people assigned by the county, patients evacuated from surrounding hospitals, physicians, staff and even some of their children and pets—which included an emotional support bunny for a nervous dog. SMH staff also delivered seven babies during the storm—but no, none of them were named Milton. The healthcare system is opening its seven urgent care centers and network of outpatient diagnostic lab/imaging centers and physician offices as electricity, water and services become available.
