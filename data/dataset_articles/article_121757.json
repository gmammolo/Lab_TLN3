  "text": "In the days before its arrival, [Hurricane Milton](/news/2024-10-11/hurricane-milton-rips-through-florida-killing-10-people/104458662) was spoken about as a historic weather event facing Florida in the south-eastern United States. It was set to be the first major storm to make a direct hit on the state's Gulf of Mexico-facing Tampa Bay — a region with a population of more than 3 million — since 1921. Meteorologists sounded the alarm about forthcoming storm surges, life-threatening flooding, and strong winds after Milton intensified from a category one storm to the highest level of five in under a day, warning those in the storm's path remaining in their homes was not an option. Much of the powerful storm surges (an abnormal rise in sea level) feared never materialised. By landfall Wednesday night, the hurricane had lost some of its intensity and crossed Florida into the Atlantic as a category three storm. But it didn't come without leaving behind a trail of destruction in an already storm-battered state, destroying homes, whipping up a spate of tornadoes, and cutting off power to millions of properties. At least 12 people were confirmed dead in Milton's aftermath and that number may well rise as flow-on flooding continues to pose a threat in the days and weeks to come. Here are some stories of how people made it through the worst of the storm. A scene from Cast Away In Hillsborough County, a teenager survived after floating on a piece of debris in an area almost entirely submerged by floodwaters on Thursday. The local county sheriff's office posted a video to social media showing a rescue unit pulling the 14-year-old boy out of what appeared to be head-deep water and onto a boat. Surrounding properties and cars were seen swamped at the time. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister told CNN the boy was laying on a broken fence when the rescue boat circled around, and appeared in clear distress. \"He was waving us down, flagging us down … most (other) people were saying 'hello'. He was frantically flailing his arms,\" Mr Chronister said. \"We went over, and it literally was like the scene of a Cast Away movie, how he's hanging on for dear life. His mum evacuated him to a safer area last night, he was walking home, and didn't realise the water was going to get as flooded as deep as it did, and he's not a great swimmer, hence the rescuing. \"He was visibly shaken. He hugged us. He was just so grateful that we took him to some dry land.\" About 200 people were rescued from floodwaters elsewhere in Hillsborough county, including 135 residents of an assisted living facility. Esky in the Atlantic Loading...Near the town of Longboat Key in Sarasota County on Thursday, a man was found floating in open waters about 50km offshore, clinging to an ice chest. US Coast Guard officials found him on the cooler following an eight-hour search operation that was launched after reports the captain of a fishing vessel had gone missing hours before the storm made landfall. On Wednesday afternoon, Captain Dave had gone out to his boat to make repairs, two days after it got disabled at sea and a rescue crew had to be sent out to bring back its crew. The boat's rudder malfunctioned again while he attempted to transit back to port, stranding the captain in rough weather. US Coast Guard officials instructed him to put on a life jacket and remain with the ship's locator radio — which is how he was ultimately found the next day. \"This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,\" Sector St. Petersburg's command centre chief, Dana Grady, said. \"To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph (120 -144kph) winds, 20-25 foot (6-7m) seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. \"He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler.\" Defiant 'Lieutenant Dan' Tampa resident Joseph Malinowski became something of a social media sensation after deciding to weather Hurricane Milton — and Helene two weeks earlier — on his sailboat. It has since emerged that Malinowski has a criminal history and was once accused of trying to set a woman on fire. In April 2022, he was released from prison after serving a one-year sentence for punching a police officer in the nose, News and Public Media for North Central Florida reports (WUFT). Last year, in a separate case, he was reportedly arrested for aggravated battery after a woman alleged he poured petrol on a park bench she was sitting on. Malinowski then set the bench on fire before allegedly pouring petrol over the woman, who feared for her life as she was smoking a cigarette, WUFT reports.The case was later dropped without explanation by prosecutors. The 54-year-old, dubbed \"Lieutenant Dan\", walked away unscathed from both storms after refusing to comply with authorities' pleas for taking shelter. University of Tampa student Terrence Concannon documented the course of Mr Malinowski's sailboat encounters on TikTok over days, including his preparations, refusal to budge when officers came along, and moments post-survival. \"Hell no,\" Lieutenant Dan said, when asked if he'd be wearing a life jacket in case his boat capsized. \"The water's going to come in, it's going to rise. If you're on land, it's going to flood, you're risking drowning,\" he said, explaining his decision . \"I'm on a boat. A boat goes up with the water. So even if the boat goes up a 100ft in the air, I'm going to be 100ft up in the air with the water. \"The safest place in the world to be, is in my boat.\" Mr Malinowski has been homeless for more than a decade, he told NBC News, and has half his leg amputated. He told local media outlets he felt \"fine\" after the hurricane had passed on Thursday afternoon, even as strong winds and roiling waters pummeled his sailboat into Tampa Bay Harbour.",
