  "text": "By Danielle Grant ,\n15 hours ago Who's ready for some cooler weather? After another unseasonably warm 80+ degree fall day, a cold front will bring us some relief from the heat!\nA weak, dry cold front will move in early Friday morning, ushering in slightly cooler weather for much of northeastern Colorado. We'll see highs in the mid-70s Friday afternoon, about 10 degrees cooler than Thursday!\nIt'll be a bit of a roller coaster ride of temperatures heading into the weekend!\nThe October heat returns for the first half of the weekend with highs in the low-80s around Denver with mostly sunny skies. Winds will pick up a bit, so watch out for high fire danger across portions of the plains.\nAnother cold front will zip across the state late Saturday night into Sunday morning, dropping temperatures yet again.\nDaytime highs will be a bit closer to normal on Sunday, in the low-70s for the Broncos game!\nThe more fall-like weather sticks around early next week with highs in the low-to mid- 70s. Unfortunately, the dry weather continues into much of next week.\nAnother unseasonably warm day across Colorado DENVER WEATHER LINKS: Hourly forecast | Radars | Traffic | Weather Page | 24/7 Weather Stream\nClick here to watch the Denver7 live weather stream.\nDenver7 live 24/7 weather stream\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
