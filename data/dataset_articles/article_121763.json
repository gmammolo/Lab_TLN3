  "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Some Hoosiers and Kentuckians were lucky Thursday night and got to see the [Northern Lights across the night sky.](/article/weather/northern-lights-kentucky-indiana-thursday-night-where-when/417-f34e43f9-4dc8-449f-93ff-a850968598c0) Usually the Northern Lights are only able to be viewed in northern climates, but sometimes the conditions are all in place for us to get lucky and be able to see them! What are the Northern Lights? The Northern Lights are a gorgeous and colorful site in our sky during the nighttime hours. It occurs when charged particles from the sun interact with the Earth's atmosphere. The \"solar wind\" carries the particles towards Earth from the sun. Usually, solar flares and other solar activity triggers the Northern Lights. The Northern Lights happen when a \"magnetic storm\" is on display and the solar particles interact with Earth's magnetic field.
