  "text": "By Shane Galvin ,\n1 hours ago\nLights, camera, aurora!\nNew Yorker’s were left awestruck Thursday night when the night sky was illuminated by a breathtaking aurora borealis display over the Big Apple.\n“It has been a LONG time since we’ve seen visible aurora over NYC,” X account New York Metro Weather wrote in a post that included a photo of the vibrant shades of purple and pink visible high above the bustling city streets.\n“And it will likely be a long time until we see it again. Go outside and look up!”\nThe aurora captured in the New York sky posted to X captioned “A ,” by user defaultshaq. New York Metro Weather/X Many New Yorkers did in fact go outside and look up – and they weren’t the only ones, as the northern lights show was visible over a much larger swath of the globe than experts initially expected.\nJames Blunt announces 2025 ‘Back To Bedlam Tour.’ Get tickets today\nThe aurora borealis was witnessed as far south as Washington DC, and across the pond in the United Kingdom.\nThe aurora seen in New Jersey by one X user. Croton/X The aurora as seen in Washington, D.C.. Caitlin Doornbos “Wow, absolutely speechless!” New York City-based meteorologist Allan Nossoff wrote in all caps on X. “These aurora visible with the naked eye #NYC!”\nAnother city dweller who couldn’t contain their excitement simply wrote : “A .”\nHow much are the cheapest tickets to see Zayn on his 2024 tour?\nOne X user in New Jersey posted photos of the overwhelming vision from their backyard and asked: “why is the aurora literally in my backyard?”\nAnother X user showed a panoramic view from Fair Haven, NY, on the banks of Lake Oswego.\nEven in Lewes, Delaware, the striking scene made for a shot worth posting for one X user.\nAurora burning a bright magenta in the skies of Pennsylvania. Janae Davne England’s Met Office shared photos that meteorologists there took from various locations around the isle.\nFolks as far as the French Alps were blessed with the once-in-a-lifetime sight.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR METRO DAILY NEWSLETTER\nAurora borealis shown in full force in Maine. NWS New York NY, /X The cause for Mother Nature’s special effects is a coronal mass ejection (CME) which erupted from the Sun earlier in the day.\nThat outburst triggered geomagnetic storms, which produced the trippy effects on the night sky here on Earth. The severity of the CME dictates how visible the aurora will be.\nMeteorologists did not expect Thursday’s storm to be as powerful as it turned out.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast originally excluded NYC\nand the Atlantic Coast from their visibility forecast. NOAA The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said earlier Thursday that expectations were for the aurora to only be somewhat visible from upstate New York – but that people in the city would miss out on the prime sky-peeping.\nThe CME was apparently strong enough to provide the other-worldly display to cover a large swath of the Atlantic coast.\nExperts say that the expanded aurora may be visible in parts of the world for as many as a couple days – but that by Friday night the lights should be out in New York City.\nFor the latest metro stories, top headlines, breaking news and more, visit nypost.com/metro/\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
