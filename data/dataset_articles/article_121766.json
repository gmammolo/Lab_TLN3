(Gray News) - First responders in Florida have been busy responding to those in need after [Hurricane Milton](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-tampa-florida-08bde4b9c29460f471d43c6512821c93) tore through the state on Wednesday. According to the [Hillsborough County](https://www.facebook.com/HCSOSheriff)[ Sheriff’s Office](https://www.facebook.com/HCSOSheriff), one of its rescue calls involved a teenager who found himself on floating debris amid rising floodwaters. Deputies said the 14-year-old had to be rescued after Hurricane Milton’s floodwaters trapped him on a floating fence in the middle of Tampa. A [video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1911970302618055&ref=sharing) published by the sheriff’s office showed Sheriff Chad Chronister and a deputy finding the boy floating near a neighborhood grocery store. The rescue crew spun around their boat to grab him. Chronister told [WFLA](https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/14-year-old-found-floating-on-fence-in-tampa-floodwaters-after-hurricane-milton/) that the teen had evacuated and was staying at a friend’s house. However, when he tried to walk back home after the storm he could not swim well enough to get through the deep waters. The boy was taken to dry land after the rescue and was able to return home. Millions of Florida residents have been [without power](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-tampa-florida-5f6a112986eb6e21720f0f17c504afe8) for hours after Milton reached the state. The storm spawned multiple powerful tornadoes across Florida before officially making landfall. Rescue crews said they are continuing to work around the clock. Copyright 2024 Gray Local Media, Inc.
