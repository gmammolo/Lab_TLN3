  "text": "A solar storm hit Earth on Thursday and was expected to bring the northern lights to dark skies farther south than normal. The timing of the storm should provide a great show for Europe, but those in North America could also see the dazzling lights as the storm persisted into nighttime.\nHave you seen the northern lights this week? You voted: Yes! Maybe I tried, but didn't see anything I haven't been watching for them Vote View Results Back The storm was classified “severe” (ranked 4 out of 5 in severity) as of Thursday afternoon, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Forecasts show the storm could continue through Friday morning, but the timing could change as more data comes in. The agency said there is even a slight chance of “extreme” storming (ranked 5 out of 5) — a rare level only seen twice in about the past two decades.\n“It is looking really good for strong aurora tonight” in the United States, Alex Young, a solar physicist at NASA, said Thursday.\nAt the current “severe” storm level, aurora could be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California. If the storm were to bump to extreme, aurora could be seen as far south as Florida with the naked eye.\nHowever, people have been able to see the dancing light displays even farther south than these guidelines by using their camera or phone lenses, which are more sensitive to light than our eyes.\nThe geomagnetic storm was created by an explosion of solar particles and energy on the sun, called a coronal mass ejection, temporarily disturbing Earth’s protective magnetic bubble. The fast-moving ejection hit Earth at nearly 1.5 million mph.\nThe coronal mass ejection “is looking pretty strong” to potentially last for nighttime viewing in the United States, said Vincent Ledvina, a space weather PhD candidate at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He said this ejection is the strongest — in terms of magnetic field strength — since May, when storming started in the afternoon and lasted through the night.\n“I think, in some capacity, we will have auroras in the U.S. tonight because the [coronal mass ejection] looks strong enough,” Ledvina said.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",
