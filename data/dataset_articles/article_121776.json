  "text": "High pressure keeps our skies nice and clear for one more night, perfect timing as the skies above get a little more active in a different and more spectacular way.\nTonight carries a strong chance of seeing the northern lights in northern Illinois. Clear skies are in place, but some wildfire smoke overhead may make for a little murky look to the sky.\nOn the ground, you'll want to grab a jacket along with the camera if you're heading out to see the lights. Temperatures fall to the upper 40s and low 50s tonight.\nSome high-level clouds overspread the area tomorrow as temperatures warm up. Highs reach into the mid 80s, likely just short of our record high of 88°.\nBreezy south winds allows the warmer air in, but it also develops a high fire danger when combined with very dry soil and low humidity. Best advice is to avoid open burning to prevent larger wildfires.\nA cold front slides through early Saturday morning, starting a big cooldown into next week. The front stalls just to our south as a low pressure system slides in from the southwest, setting up a slight chance for rain.\nA few spotty showers are possible mainly east of I-39, Saturday afternoon and evening with low rainfall amounts expected. Otherwise, highs fall to around 70° on Saturday, 60s on Sunday, then mid 50s to complete a 30° cooldown through Monday and Tuesday.",
