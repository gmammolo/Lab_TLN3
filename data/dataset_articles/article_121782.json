  "text": "A severe geomagnetic storm provided an exciting evening for Delawareans who saw a colorful show in the skies. A crisp, clear evening provided perfect viewing conditions for a coronal mass ejection that left the sun on October 8, and took two days to reach Earth. As of 7:37 p.m. Thursday, the Space Weather Prediction Center had issued a Severe Geomagnetic Storm Alert, saying that enough solar radiation for a G4 storm, out of a G5 scale. They could not rule out if it could become slightly stronger before wrapping up early Friday. The strength of the storm allowed the aurora borealis, or northern lights, to be viewed much further south than usual. Auroras are caused by electrons colliding with Earth's atmosphere , and through a series of reactions leads to energy being emmitted as light, similar to neon. Most aurora are 50-300 miles above the Earth's surface. There was a major event in early May that Delaware missed out on due to a series of rain storms. Typically, it might reach down to the New York/Pennsylvania border, but activity Thursday night was expected to work down into the Carolinas. The light show does come with a few catches, there is a chance for voltage control problems on the power grids, and potential issues with GPS technology when the disturbances are at their worst. According to the SWPC, the peak of the energy reached earth at 3 p.m. Thursday, but levels were still in the warning level after sunset. In Delaware Thursday, that means skyviewers saw pink, purple, and green hues, especially when seen through a camera lens. Usually, the peak viewing time for an aurora is between 10 p.m. - 2 a.m.",
