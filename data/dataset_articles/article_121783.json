  "text": "This transition opens access to over 400 articles, webinars, story maps, and expert discussions. From hurricane updates to storm chaser interviews and seasonal weather analyses, the Weather Band has become a rich resource for anyone interested in meteorology. New content will continue to be added, maintaining its relevance.\n\"By taking Weather Band public, we are making the expertise of our AMS members and our weather enthusiast community even more useful to you - whether you're a teacher, a student, or simply interested in the latest meteorology and climate science,\" said Claudia Gorski, AMS Director of Community Engagement. She encouraged everyone to explore the content, sign up for the community newsletter, and share ideas for future offerings.\nIn addition to articles and webinars, the Weather Band also features an annual weather photography competition and a multi-day virtual conference called \"Jamposium.\" With content ranging from space weather to climate science, the platform is a valuable tool for educators, citizen scientists, and weather enthusiasts alike.\nRelated Links\nAMS Weather Band\nEarth Observation News - Suppiliers, Technology and Application\n|\n|\n|",
