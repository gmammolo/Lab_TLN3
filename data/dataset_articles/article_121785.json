  "text": "Columbia, SC (WOLO) — Northern lights! Pictures from around our area seeing the Aurora Borealis Thursday night in the Midlands. just a few quick pictures from some viewers out at the Lake Murray Dam and also from viewers in Lexington. Very cool! They are best seen until about 1-2 a.m and suggested to be observed with the least light pollution and in rural areas.How was it possible for us to see the Northern Lights here in the Palmetto state? According to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association (NOAA), the colorful lights that were visible throughout the state Thursday night are due to a “severe” geomagnetic storm.According to NOAA’S Space Weather Prediction Center, a geomagnetic storm takes place when there is a “major disturbance of the Earth’s magnetosphere that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange of energy from the solar wind into the space environment surrounding Earth.”Regardless, the cause of the light show was the last thing many South Carolinians were in awe over. For many it was the images covering the night sky giving some a rare glimpse at more than a moon lit sky.",
