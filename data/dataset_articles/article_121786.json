  "text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - As fall rolls into the hills and mountains of West Virginia, the vibrant colors are beginning to grace the treetops of the Kanawha State Forest. West Virginia draws in visitors from across the country to admire them. “Thanks to our mountainous landscape, West Virginia’s amazing foliage can be seen for an extended period of time,” said West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby. “Stunning hues can still be found in the highest elevations of the state while lower elevations are beginning to pop with glimpses of the exceptional fall color, with even more to come. There’s still plenty of time to plan your leaf-peeping adventure to the Mountain State!” Brian Haga, the Assistant Superintendent at the Kanawha State Forest, said the Kanawha Valley is a few weeks away from its peak season. “The majority of the Kanawha Valley is going to see that color change at the end of October. Lasting throughout the month of November, so it’s the last place in the state where you are going to see that peak foliage,” Haga said. If you’re planning a fall getaway or day trip across the state, the West Virginia Department of Tourism has a few tools to help. West Virginia Department of Tourism’s live leaf tracker features user-generated photos from social media to show current conditions. Haga recommends a hike up to Castle Rock trail in the Kanawha State Forest for some of the best views. Visitors can access the trail by taking the CCC snipe trail to the top of the hill to Mossy Rock, according to Haga. “You are able to see a nice valley and see that multitude of different colors ... the reds and oranges,” Haga said.
