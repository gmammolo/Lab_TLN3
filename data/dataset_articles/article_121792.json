  "text": "The Aurora Borealias (northern lights) is putting on a show tonight, that will be better than the one in May this year. Geo-magnetic index Kp is around 9 right now, equiv to a G4 (strong) event. Aurora sightings have been reported as far south as Tennessee. Social media is buzzing with images taken by amateurs and professionals alike. The aurora has been visible across many parts of the UK this eveningHere are some photos taken by our meteorologists situated across the country pic.twitter.com/pTvGTuRqWK— Met Office (@metoffice) October 10, 2024 The aurora has been visible across many parts of the UK this eveningHere are some photos taken by our meteorologists situated across the country pic.twitter.com/pTvGTuRqWK Auroras and CMEs Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona. They can eject billions of tons of coronal material and carry an embedded magnetic field. CMEs travel outward from the Sun at speeds ranging from slower than 250 km/s to as fast as near 3000 km/s. www.swpc.noaa.gov/... This space storm is a result of an X1.8 solar flare and a fast (1200 to 1300 km/s) coronal mass ejection (CME) that erupted from the Sun on the evening of 8 October, 2024. The X1.8 flare was observed on Oct 9 at 0156 UTC from Region 3848. Active Region 3848 is currently just above the Sun's equator and slightly to the east as shown in the Solar Synoptic Map below. The SOHO LASCO Coronagraph image below shows the solar flare and CME on Oct 9. The white streak to the right is Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS)! Earlier this month, the Sun emitted X7.1 and X9.0 solar flares and CMEs on Oct 1 and 3 resp. The X9.0 flare was the strongest of this 11-year solar cycle. However, they did not create such strong geo-mag storms and auroras. The colors of the Aurora Auroras are caused by emissions from O atoms and N2 molecules. High energy electrons in the CME cause the energy states of O and N2 to rise (aka excitation) which result in photon emissions at specific wavelengths (colors) as the O and N2 energy falls back to its ground state. Intense solar storms cause lower altitude N2 emissions. How about the red colors often seen high in the sky? Atomic O is unusual in terms of its return to ground state after excitation: it takes ~0.7 seconds to emit green light and up to 2 minutes for red. For more info about aurora colors, see en.wikipedia.org/... and www.nps.gov/.... Epilogue So, let’s step out and take some pictures. Even if the aurora is not visible to the naked eye, phone cameras are quite good at capturing them and their colors. Try it.",
