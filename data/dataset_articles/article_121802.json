  "text": "‘God is good!’ Jamaicans in Florida happy to escape Hurricane Milton’s wrath NEW YORK, United States — Jamaicans in Florida have escaped major damage from Hurricane Milton which slammed into the state late Wednesday night, packing winds of more than 145 miles an hour, and causing historic rainfall and flooding. “God is good,” Joan Edghill, president of the Jamaican Association of Central Florida, told the Jamaica Observer, noting that “there [was] no serious damage in the Ocoee area near Orlando. There [have] been no reports of damage from the winds or flooding but people are out cleaning up whatever little debris there is.” She acknowledged, though, that for some, the passage of the hurricane had been a nerve-racking experience. Miramar resident Juliet Mattadeen had a similar story. She told the Observer that “the hurricane caused no issues and, in fact, people relocated from other areas of the state to stay with friends and relatives”. Damion Thompson, a West Palm Beach resident, said that while many Jamaicans were well-prepared for the storm, it passed without any major damage. He said that except for some heavy rains and winds there was nothing to be concerned about. Miami-based retiree Alman Bailey was among those who told the Observer that the hurricane had no direct impact on him. “Heavy rains was the only problem,” he said. In Lauderhill, which has a big Jamaican population, Denise Grant, who is seeking to be elected the city’s mayor, said the area was spared any serious damage as a result of the storm although it was under tornado watch. She, too, noted that there was a lot of rain and that several lost electricity, which she said has since been restored. It was not all good news for everyone, however. In Tampa and nearby Tampa Bay which were among the worst-hit areas, some Jamaicans were among those who had their homes damaged by flood waters,” said Peter Gracey, Global Jamaica Diaspora Council (GJDC) representative for the southern United States. He said, however, that “it is not possible at the moment to provide detailed information on the situation as some [Jamaicans] had relocated elsewhere and may only now be beginning to return home to assess the situation.” However, he stated that most people within the Jamaican community seemed to be alright based on the feedback so far. Grant told the Observer that “some Jamaicans in Palm Beach suffered some damage. I don’t know to what extent, but I am working to get some information.” The GJDC’s Gracey said, in the meantime, people who may need assistance should call the state’s helpline at 833 438 4673.",
