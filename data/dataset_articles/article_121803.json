  "text": "Get ready for a fabulous Friday and a sunny weekend with just a few clouds to keep things cool. Beach days, mountain escapes, or just chilling out – your weekend forecast has you covered! Photo Unsplash Newsroom\n11 OCTOBER 2024 - 08:23 Get ready for a fabulous weekend! Today, we’re looking at mostly clear skies with a few clouds popping in here and there. Perfect for any outdoor plans! Expect temperatures to reach 31°C inland, 29°C on the east coast, and a breezy 28°C along the rest of the coastline. If you're headed to the mountains, you'll enjoy a refreshing 25°C. Winds will be light, so the sea will be choppy but manageable for beachgoers.\nIt’s mostly clear again tonight, but keep an eye out for some low clouds, especially near the coast. We might see a little fog in the early hours inland and in the east. Temperatures will cool off to a comfortable 17°C inland, and around 20°C by the southeast and east coast.\nFor the rest of the weekend, Saturday and Sunday are shaping up to be sunny and pleasant, with just a few clouds to keep things interesting. Monday might bring a bit of rain in the mountains, but overall, temperatures will stay warm, just above average for this time of year. Enjoy your weekend, and don’t forget the sunscreen!\nSoaring prices of fruits and vegetables hitting consumers hard Digital Agenda: The Bright Side of Cyprus and Its Technological Prospects Ακολουθήστε το KNEWS\nστο Google News TAGS Cyprus | weather",
