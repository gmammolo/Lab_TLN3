  "text": "Skies in Leh, Ladakh were lit up by a rare aurora borealis due to a strong geomagnetic storm that reached Earth on Thursday.\nListen to Story\nLive TV\nShare Advertisement Northern lights visible in Leh due to solar storm. (X/@dorje1974) India Today Science Desk\nNew Delhi, UPDATED: Oct 11, 2024 10:50 IST In Short Auroras lit up Leh's sky due to a severe geomagnetic storm. The storm was caused by a powerful CME from an X1.8 solar flare. Auroras were visible as far south as Alabama in the US. A spectacular display of auroras lit up the skies over Leh, India, as a severe geomagnetic storm struck Earth on October 10, 2024.\nThe auroras were captured at India’s highest observatory in Hanle.\nThis event was triggered by a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun , which reached Earth earlier today. The CME originated from an X1.8 solar flare that occurred on October 9, and it travelled at speeds exceeding 1.5 million miles per hour. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dorje Angchuk (@dorje_nyrchung)\nadvertisement The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified the geomagnetic storm as G4, indicating severe conditions that could disrupt power grids and satellite operations.\nSuch storms can cause auroras to be visible much further south than usual, with reports suggesting sightings as far south as Alabama and northern California in the United States. FINALLY got to see the #northernlights ! I never thought I’d be able to see them from my light polluted backyard. But it was absolutely incredible! #nepa pic.twitter.com/vYmZp12WTp — Colleen Joyce (@C_Joyce3183) October 11, 2024 Photos of the #Northernlights taken just moments ago, right over my house ðèðæ\nI’ve watched them numerous times right over my house and from my backyard deck âºï¸ pic.twitter.com/GDtpPooDv1 — Leon Thomas Braun (@LeonThomasBraun) October 11, 2024 Ladakh witnesses rare auroras. See pictures\nIn Leh, the vibrant colours of the auroras created a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of the night sky.\n<div class='ads__container inline-story-add id ='v-indiatoday-in' > The geomagnetic storm is part of an ongoing period of heightened solar activity as the Sun approaches its solar maximum, expected to peak in 2025. What an amazing photograph of the red aurora!\nIt was taken at 00:04 by Dorjey Yurgyal, our Telescope Operator at the Himalayan Chandra Telescope #HCT in #Hanle #HDSR #Ladakh using his phone! @IndiaDST @asipoec @lg_ladakh @prasarbharti @Indus_SolPhy @cessi_iiserkol @dorje1974 pic.twitter.com/idYECjBd6d — IIAstrophysics (@IIABengaluru) October 10, 2024\nThis cycle has led to an increase in solar flares and CMEs, which are responsible for creating auroras when charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field.\nThe auroras observed in Leh were a direct result of these interactions, showcasing brilliant reds that captivated onlookers. Here is an awesome photo of the gorgeous red #Aurora from Dorje Angchuk @dorje1974 from Stakna (outside #Leh #Ladakh , 30 sec exp from phone) @ 2:45 AM! @IndiaDST @asipoec @fiddlingstars @karandi65 @lg_ladakh @utladakhtourism @doot_iia @Indus_SolPhy @cessi_iiserkol @PrinSciAdvOff pic.twitter.com/Hub9q7Urpy — IIAstrophysics (@IIABengaluru) October 10, 2024\nWhile the visual display was stunning, scientists warned of potential disruptions caused by the storm.\nHigh-frequency radio communications were already experiencing interference, and there were concerns about impacts on satellite navigation systems.\nPower companies and aviation authorities were advised to monitor conditions closely to mitigate any adverse effects.\nAs residents and tourists marvelled at the celestial light show, experts emphasised the importance of understanding space weather’s impact on technology and infrastructure.\nThis geomagnetic event shows our Sun’s dynamic nature and its influence on life on Earth.
