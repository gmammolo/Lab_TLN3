  "text": "Northern lights visible in central Arizona The northern lights were visible in some parts of central Arizona on Thursday night. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-severe-storm-watch-10-11-october), solar material and magnetic fields erupted and created a coronal mass ejection Oct. 8. This resulted in a geomagnetic storm that arrived at Earth on Thursday and caused the aurora borealis to be visible in some parts of North America. Although NOAA forecast the aurora would be visible Thursday night as far south as northern Utah, some Arizonans away from light pollution could catch a glimpse. People who missed the northern lights Thursday could have a second chance to see them Friday night. \"The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right,\" according to NOAA statement. NOAA offers an [aurora forecast online.](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) Will Arizona see northern lights in 2025 [Here's what experts say and how to watch](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2024/10/04/northern-lights-arizona-2025/75494995007/)",
