  "text": "People in East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire were treated to the splendour of the Northern Lights earlier.\nThe lights could be seen in several locations, with many of the photos captured as the skies darkened at about 19:30 BST.\nCraig Snell, weather forecaster at the Met Office, said a solar storm caused a powerful flare from the sun on Wednesday, which arrived in our atmosphere this evening.\nHe said: \"The conditions are particularly good tonight, we have clear skies and the moon has set early this evening, giving people a good chance to see the Northern Lights.\"\nMr Snell said the strength of the lights would ebb and flow throughout the evening, but the lights may be captured at different times throughout the night.\nHe added: \"The further north you are, the stronger the chance of capturing the lights will be, and being away from street lights gives you a better chance of seeing them with the naked eye.\"\nHowever, Mr Snell said even people in towns and cities might be able to capture the phenomenon if they have a good camera phone, and point their devices north.\nNorthern Lights seen over UK skies in stunning photos\nThe phenomenon, also known as the aurora borealis, are caused by charged particles from the sun hitting gases in the Earth’s atmosphere.\nThey have been particularly visible in 2024 due to the biggest geomagnetic storm since 2003, according to Sean Elvidge, a professor in space environment at the University of Birmingham.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds , watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here .\nMore on this story What are the Northern Lights?
