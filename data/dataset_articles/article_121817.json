The sun nearing the peak of its solar cycle means we’ve seen more space weather events in recent months, according to forecasters\nNorthern Lights put on stunning display across Ireland and UK - 10th October 2024\nIrish Independent Newsdesk Today at 07:45\nThe northern lights were visible in parts of the country on Thursday night with hues of pink, green and purple visible to the naked eye.\nSocial media users have shared photos of the Aurora Borealis across Ireland, as sightings of the lights were predicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland earlier by the UK’s Met Office.\nThe lights were also visible in southern counties Cork, Clare and Wexford.\nAcademic Jim Wild (49), who researches the aurora and space weather at Lancaster University in England, said: “My research focuses on the physics of the connections between the Sun and the Earth.\n“Over the years, I’ve been to the Arctic Circle several times to make measurements of the aurora, but it’s really special to see the northern lights from your back garden with your whole family.”\nRelatively clear skies were forecast for much of Ireland and the UK last night, creating a “decent chance of visibility”.\nKilworth Camp, Co.Cork. Photo: @auroraalertsIRE\nA spokesman for Met Office UK said there had been “more space weather events in recent months”, including the Northern Lights, because the sun was nearing the peak of its solar cycle.\nMet Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said there was a chance of some visible auroras across parts of the UK on Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday.\nThe auroras on Earth, which are most commonly seen over high polar latitudes but can spread south, are chiefly influenced by geomagnetic storms which originate from activity on the Sun.\nThe sun works on a cycle of around 11 years called the solar cycle – with peak sunspot activity on the surface of the Sun referred to as solar maximum.\nSunspots give the potential for Earth-directed releases of large bursts of energy, called coronal mass ejections, which can lead to aurora visibility.\nAurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere around the magnetic poles.\nAs they collide, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky.\nWe need your consent to load this Social Media content.
