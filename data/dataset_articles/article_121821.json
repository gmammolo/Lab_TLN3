  "text": "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to impact the earth later on Thursday. As a result, the Space Weather Prediction Center has issued a rare watch. The last severe storm watch was in May. During that storm, G5 levels were achieved and we had our best aurora in years. The aurora could be seen at times with our own eyes, and was very vivid on our phones using the low light setting. While G3-G4 levels are ethe most likely outcome, we cannot rule out a G5 storm once again. If G5 levels are not seen with this storm, G4 levels would still bring the northern lights overhead for all of Mid-Michigan. That best case scenario would also bring sights of the northern lights as far south as the Carolinas to California. The moon will also be below the horizon for most of the night, allowing us to find the aurora without any extra light. The best news with this opportunity is the skies will be clear. Everything is lining up for a really nice look at the lights, as long as the storm arrives on time and is as strong as it is forecast to be. If you are planning to go out, make sure to get away from light pollution. It will be quite chilly in the 40s along with some wind, so be sure to bundle up! The last piece of advice is you will want to wait an hour or so after sunset. Our current forecast has the strongest portion of the storm coming through from sunset to 2 AM.",
