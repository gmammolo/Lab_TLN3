  "text": "A strong solar storm created a dazzling display in the night sky and let people across portions of the United States see the rare Northern Lights.\nHowever, the so-called solar storm is also triggering a warning from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) about potential disruptions to power grids and satellite communications.\nNOAA astronauts captured displays from the sky showing what happens when there's a surge in solar activity. Raj Dixit with the Sacramento Valley Astronomical Society said these kinds of special events are expected.\n\"There has been a solar storm sparked by a very intense flare on the surface of the sun called a coronal mass ejection,\" Dixit said. \"That's when strong gases on the sun, when they explode violently, that can create severe electromagnetic interference all the way to Earth.\"\nThe geomagnetic activity could potentially impact GPS, power grids and radio communications. It's a concern as people race to help those suffering after Hurricane Milton.\nAs of now, there are no reports of interference in Florida, but the solar storm is expected to last until tomorrow night. It could also trigger beautiful displays of Northern Lights as far south as Alabama.\nFor those eager to witness the lights, Dixit advises looking due north between 8:30 PM and 9 PM. For viewing on your phone, turn your exposure up and use night mode.\nMore from CBS News 3 indicted in bank robbery scheme spanning Sacramento, several Bay Area cities Ballots, laptops among items stolen during burglaries at 2 Sacramento-area post offices City of Modesto says it will work toward filling in homeless caves following CBS13 report Red Cross calls for California volunteers to help with Florida disaster response Sacramento's Aftershock rock festival kicks off 12th year with biggest lineup yet In: Northern Lights",
