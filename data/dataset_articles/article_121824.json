  "text": "India is filled with hidden gems that are just waiting to be explored. For travellers, who wish to experience unique weather conditions, the country has something special to offer. While India is often known for its scorching October heat, Northern India, in particular, has some of the coldest destinations in the country, where temperatures can be bone-chilling. If you are looking to enjoy snow-covered landscapes, cozy cottages and thrilling winter sports, here is a list of the best places to visit that will give you a taste of winter.\\nSpiti Valley\\nIn October, the temperatures at night in this Himachal Pradesh region often dip below zero. But during the day, the warmth of sunshine mixed with chilly air feels lovely. While in Spiti, one should not miss exploring the historic monasteries, along with other beautiful sights.\\nGulmarg\\nThe region located in Jammu & Kashmir, is currently facing freezing temperatures, but in the coming months, it will transform into a snowy paradise. Last year, snowfall was delayed, leaving many tourists disappointed. But people who visited in late January had unforgettable experiences. If you want to witness Kashmir’s winter charm without the crowds, now is the perfect time to make your reservations.\\nLadakh\\nIn Ladakh, the temperatures start to drop from October. It is common to experience such freezing conditions, especially at night. But don’t let the chilly weather discourage you from exploring this beautiful region. During the day, places like Leh, Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake become paradise under the bright sun.\\nKeylong\\nLocated in the Lahaul and Spiti districts, Keylong is one of the least explored winter spots and a true hidden gem for those who love cold weather. In October, temperatures often go below and the nights can be extremely cold. Keylong offers a peaceful atmosphere for those looking to escape the usual tourist spots and enjoy winters in isolation.\\nChitkul\\nAnother winter paradise of Himachal Pradesh, which typically experiences freezing temperatures at night.
