  "text": "Lots of Brits got to see the Northern Lights last night Joe Harker\nIf you weren't one of the lucky lot who got to see the Northern Lights last night then you can at least treat yourself to looking at the plethora of pictures that made their way onto social media.\nLast night (10 October) they could be seen as far south as Kent, helped in no small part by the forecast of clear skies for a lot of the UK meaning there was good visibility to spot them.\nThe Met Office had said there was 'some uncertainty' as to which bits of Britain would be able to see them, but it seems like it was a good night for those who wanted to watch the skies .\nAdvert\nOf course if you missed it then you might be wondering when your next chance is coming, and it may not be long before you can have another go.\nOnce again it'll depend of where you are in the UK and you'll need luck to be on your side.\nLast night (10 October) was a great chance to view the lights (Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) Speaking ahead of last night's dazzling display, Met Office spokesperson Stephen Dixon said: \"The further north you are, the more likely you are to get good visibility.\"\nAdvert\nIt's pretty much the case whenever the Northern Lights are going to be visible in some part of the UK, otherwise the lights wouldn't be very northern.\nFor those hoping for a weekend watch-along, Dixon had also said that while the strongest showing would be Thursday night there could be some other chances to spot the lights over the next couple of days.\nHowever, according to PA he said these 'residual viewings' were more than likely going to be seen in Scotland and not the rest of the UK.\nNaturally the usual advice for spotting the Northern Lights applies , which is to get yourself away from sources of light pollution and be looking at a clear night sky while facing northwards.\nAdvert\nLots of people trekked out for a good look, but there might be a second chance for some Brits at the weekend (Ian Forsyth/Getty Images) Given that you'll be out at night it's best to wrap up warm and bring some hot form of sustenance which will help keep the chill of the night at bay.\nAccording to the Met Office, the Northern Lights are most active during the equinox and solstice, meaning that the months of March, April, September and October are your best chance for a viewing.\nIt's possible that the best viewing for the year was indeed last night, so commiserations if you weren't able to see it.\nAdvert\nIf they won't come to you then you might be inclined to go and seek them out by travelling abroad , though it's meant to bring bad luck to try and hunt down the Northern Lights.\nFeatured Image Credit: George Mattock/Getty Jim Dyson/Getty Topics: UK News , Weather",
