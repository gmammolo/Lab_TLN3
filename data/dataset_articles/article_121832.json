  "text": "Hurricane Milton has come and gone, and the Northern Lights could pop up right on the storm’s heels.\nAccording to the NOAA, a “severe” G4 geomagnetic storm watch is underway, which is forecast to last through Friday.\nRecommended Videos\nDuring this time, there’s a possibility that Aurora Borealis could be seen as far south as Central Florida.\nTypical viewing for geomagnetic storm conditions WHEN WILL THEY HAPPEN?\nUniversity of Alaska researchers predict that geomagnetic activity will be strongest around Thursday evening before gradually dropping off as we approach late Friday. As a result, this will likely be the best time for people in affected areas to see the northern lights.\nNorthern lights forecast Earlier this year, an intense G5 geomagnetic storm caused northern lights to blossom all the way down to South Florida. While the storm this time around isn’t quite as strong, chances remain slim that Central Florida could get another look at them.\nAurora Borealis over Florida in May 2024.

CAN I WATCH THEM FROM FLORIDA?\nIf the Aurora were to materialize in Central Florida with the current storm, it would likely be red and very low on the horizon.\nWhile there is no guarantee the Northern Lights will be seen in Central Florida, hopeful sky watchers should allow 15 minutes for their eyes to adjust to the darkness.\nLook north and low on the horizon.\nA planetary K index of 9 is typically needed to catch a glimpse in Florida. As of Thursday afternoon , that value was just below 8.\nClouds will be an issue, especially along the coast, as the the stiff breeze from Milton sends moisture from the Atlantic into the peninsula.\nFuture clouds and rain The best chance for breaks in the clouds will be along and west of I-4.\nWHAT ARE THE AURORA BOREALIS? (NORTHERN LIGHTS)\nThe Aurora Borealis, commonly known as the northern lights, are vibrant dancing ribbons of light that form as a result of electrons colliding with Earth’s upper atmosphere.\nThe solar wind, charged protons and electrons emitted from the sun, first interacts with and significantly disturbs Earth’s magnetic field causing a geomagnetic storm.\nThose particles follow Earth’s magnetic field and enter the Earth’s atmosphere at or around the poles. This is where the magnetic field is at its weakest.\nHow Northern Lights form Those electrons then interact with and excite molecules in Earth’s atmosphere. The excitement of the molecules results in the production of vibrant colors in the sky.\nThe largest geomagnetic storms are caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) — a large ejection of the sun’s magnetic field and plasma.",
