  "text": "NEW YORK - As a girl in Michigan, Ms Gabriela Aguilar sometimes went looking for the northern lights in the state’s Upper Peninsula. But it was not until the night of Oct 10, when she climbed to the roof of her apartment building in Harlem, that she finally saw them.\n“I’m just shocked that it took my entire life to be able to see it,” said Ms Aguilar, 37, who stood with her dog, Gomez, and watched the sky turn pink, purple and green until the autumn chill drove her back inside. “And – of all places – seeing it in New York City.”\nNew Yorkers were treated to a rare light show on the night of Oct 10 as the aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, spread an ethereal smear across the sky. On social media, people as far south as Washington and Kentucky reported seeing the lights, which in pictures seemed to vary in colour and intensity – from neon pink to a subtle hazy purple.\nProfessor Udi Ofer of public affairs at Princeton University was at home shortly after dusk when a neighbour texted to alert him to the sky. He rushed to his backyard in Princeton, New Jersey, with his nine-year-old daughter and four-year-old son.\nFor about 20 minutes, they watched stripes of pink and purple as the stars began to come out.\n“I think the thing that’s most remarkable about it are the streaks of light, which I just didn’t expect,” Prof Ofer, 49, said. He called them “pretty magical”.\nThe facts behind the event are nearly as spectacular as the sight of New York City’s night sky streaked with pink. The lights started with a “severe” geomagnetic storm, the result of a “fast coronal mass ejection” of plasma from the sun on the night of Oct 8, according to the Space Weather Prediction Centre.\nThe charged particles raced through space at 2.4 million kmh and reached Earth at 11.15am local time, the centre found. The event brought enough energy coursing through space to possibly disrupt satellites in orbit and power systems on Earth, the centre warned.\nNew York City’s Emergency Management Department said there could be possible disruptions to electricity, Global Positioning System and communications systems, but suggested there was little need for the public to be concerned.\nAt the National Weather Station centre in Upton, New York, on Long Island, meteorologist Bill Goodman took a break from his monitors and screens on the night of Oct 10 to go outside and look up.\n“We got a pretty cool picture of that behind our Doppler radar,” he said, describing a picture taken from the centre’s campus and posted on the social platform X. It was the second severe solar storm of the year to cause extended aurora borealis on Earth, “but this time we lucked out because we had clear skies across the entire New York City area”, Mr Goodman said.\n“To get them here to the New York metro area is pretty rare,” said Dr David Robinson, New Jersey’s state meteorologist, who saw some vestiges of the lights from the second-storey window of his house near Princeton on Oct 10 night.\nMs Anna Kathryn Barry, a lawyer, heard on her commute home from Washington that the northern lights might appear over the region.\nShe doubted that she would actually see it. But, at about 7.20pm, she headed out to her deck in Herndon, Virginia. Sure enough, she could see the northern lights.\n“At first, it looked like purple clouds almost,” said Ms Barry, 32, and added: “Then it started to get richer in colour.”\nThe light show lasted about 15 minutes before slowly fading away, Ms Barry said.\nThe lights may return on the night of Oct 11 because the stream of charged particles is continuing, Mr Goodman said, and New York’s skies will remain clear.\nThe area’s next big aerial show will be the Tsuchinshan-Atlas comet, which will rival the brightness of Jupiter starting this week. To find it, scout out the darkest location available with an open view of the western horizon, looking low in the evening sky, near where the sun has set.
