  "text": "[Indigo](/index.php?members/indigo.761342/)\nProfessional\nDon't you have the same feeling? It's like everyone here lives in the good old past. I kind a feel that we all started watching careers of Federer and Nadal and now that Nadal retires it's slapping us in face that 20 years have passed. I am on this forum since 2006, whooping 18 years. People here nowadays talk so much about the past. We have new players but no one really cares. Young members choose to be somewhere else and not on a tennis forum. It's all about Fed, Rafa or Djokovic, a wheel chair one leg in a grave trio. And then there are so many references on a daily basis about tennis in 90s and 80s and so on. Youngsters can just scratch their head on this. Yeah, I watched Sampras and Agassi as a kid back in the first half of 90s. Good years I must say. I am old too what to do. So how do you guys feel, are we all going to be stuck in the past forever now that we have seen climax of tennis with the Big 3 or is there any chance that some youth will step in both in real life and in this virtual tennis oasis? Tell me about your old (or perhaps young) experience. Thanks.",
