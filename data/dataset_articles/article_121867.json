  "text": "As Hurricane Milton pounded Florida Thursday (Oct 10) with full-throttle intensity, the tale of a rescue mission unfolded far away in the Gulf of Mexico has surprised many. In a scenario described as ‘nightmare’ by the emergency crew, a man was rescued 48 km off Florida coast as he helplessly clung to an ice box. The man, whose identity remains unknown, was luckily able to dial the coast guard station in nearby St Petersburg before contact was lost. His fishing vessel had malfunctioned on Wednesday near Madeira Beach, just before the storm made landfall. — USCGSoutheast (@USCGSoutheast) [#Breaking]An[@USCG]Air Station Miami 65 helicopter crew rescued a man clinging to a cooler approximately 30 mi. off Longboat Key. The man was taken to Tampa General Hospital for medical care. Sector St. Pete lost communications w/ the man at approx. 6:45 p.m., Wed.[#SAR][pic.twitter.com/64wSHuRAeH][October 10, 2024] [×](#) He was spotted and rescued by officials on Thursday, hugging an open cooler chest. A video of the rescue has now gone viral on the internet. “This man survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner,” coast guard official Dana Grady said. The man was later taken to Tampa General Hospital for treatment. It was mayhem on Florida streets Thursday (Oct 10) as Hurricane Milton tore through the US state, leaving behind a trail of massive destruction and piles of debris. Government officials said the monster storm left at least 16 people dead, including six in St. Lucie County on Florida's Atlantic coast. More than 11 million people still faced threats of flash and river flooding in the state. At around 11:50 am ET on Thursday, more than 3.4mn people were facing power outages across the counties. Watch: Hurricane Milton Drives Record Insurance Losses in Florida According to estimates, Milton brought a 1-in-1,000-year rainfall to the US state, with the Tampa Bay area being the worst-affected. The monster storm may have caused a loss of up to $50 billion (insured) to Florida property owners, claimed Fitch Ratings on Thursday. The agency added that it would be the largest insured loss since Hurricane Ian in 2022. Coming on the heels of Hurricane Helene two weeks prior, Milton would further push total insured losses for insurers in the state over $100 billion for the fifth straight year, the Fitch analysts wrote.
