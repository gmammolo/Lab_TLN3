  "text": "The second weekend of October will see changes compared to the weather of the last few days, with upheavals throughout the country. Colonel Mario Giuliacci reels off the weather forecast: “In the North the phase of bad weather will end, with the clouds already giving way to large clearings, while the last rains will wet the extreme North-East at the beginning of the day. On Saturday 12 October the temporary return of some showers is possible in Valle d’Aosta, Liguria and Piedmont, but overall the weekend will be dry and at times sunny in much of the North. Even in the central regions, the last part of the week will bring a prevalence of good weather, even if the days will be cooler”.\nBut it didn’t end here. Here’s what you read above meteogiuliacci.it : “In the South the change will concern not so much the conditions of the sky, which will be mostly clear or little cloudy, but rather the temperatures, which will be significantly decreasing almost everywhere. The anomalous heat of the last few days will thus give way to decidedly more autumnal temperatures, in many places below normal”.\n#Weather #change #goodbye #bad #weather #Giuliaccis #prediction #weekend #Tempo",
