  "text": "A strong geomagnetic storm means people in almost half of the United States might get a chance to see auroras in the sky Thursday night. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center, northern lights could be visible from the West Coast to the East Coast and as far south as California and Alabama The extensive display is the result of a coronal mass ejection caused by a solar flare that reached Earth at around 8:15 a.m. Thursday morning. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Space Weather Prediction Center issued a watch for a “severe” geomagnetic storm Wednesday. But Thursday, the agency issued a warning for a “strong (or higher)” storm instead. To view the lights, stay away from light pollution and look towards the northern horizon. Follow the Space Weather Prediction Center’s 30-minute aurora forecast to see the latest predictions of where the lights will be visible. – Lizzy Acker covers Oregon weather and writes the advice column Why Tho?
