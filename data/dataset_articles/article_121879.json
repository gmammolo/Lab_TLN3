  "text": "Breathtaking Northern Lights over Plymouth as city spectacularly lit up There may be a chance to see them again tonight\nBookmark\nShare\nComments News By Katie Timms Senior Content Editor 09:09, 11 OCT 2024 Bookmark\nWilliam Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10] (Image: William Green) Plymouth's sky was spectacularly lit up by the Northern Lights last night - and many people were awake to witness the incredible display.\nPeople across the UK, including in Devon and Cornwall, were treated to the fabulous display of pink, red and green lights throughout yesterday evening and early morning, as the aurora borealis made its grand appearance.\nSome lucky people who were able to pick up the lights on their phones, shared their incredible snaps with us, which you can see below.\nIf you were fast asleep, there's a possibility you may be able to see the lights again tonight, October 11. Although the Met Office previously stated that last night, October 10, was the best time to see the aurora, they also mentioned that there was a possibility of them appearing between 10pm and 11pm tonight.\nHowever, the chances of witnessing the Northern Lights again tonight are much lower. The Met Office's latest space weather forecast indicates that the likelihood of seeing the aurora will gradually decrease through October 11 and become limited to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.\nProfessor Jim Wild, a 49-year-old academic from Lancaster University who studies the aurora and space weather, was able to capture the Northern Lights from his back garden last night. He shared the special experience with his family, saying: \"My research focuses on the physics of the connections between the sun and the Earth.\n\"I've had the opportunity to visit the Arctic Circle multiple times to take measurements of the aurora, but seeing the Northern Lights from my own back garden with my entire family is truly special.\"\nIf you would like to share your photographs, please email news@plymouthherald.co.uk.\nWilliam Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 1 of 8 Share\nComments William Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 2 of 8 Share\nComments The Northern Lights over Plymouth\n(Image: Submitted) 3 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 4 of 8 Share\nComments William Green captured these incredible snaps on Dartmoor last night [October 10]\n(Image: William Green) 5 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 6 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 7 of 8 Share\nComments Richard Hargrave caught these shots of the lights over Plymouth from Tregantle\n(Image: Richard Hargrave) 8 of 8 Share\nComments More On Weather",
