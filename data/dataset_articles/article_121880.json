  "text": "Warm end to the work week FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - Friday will be just like the past several days. Dry and plenty of afternoon sunshine, but unlike the past few days, high temperatures in the afternoon will be in the upper 70s, flirting with 80 degrees, which is well above normal for this time of year! The weekend will bring some changes as a weather system begins to approach us. This will bring some scattered rain chances, mostly later in the day on Saturday, through the overnight, and into Sunday morning. The good news is no one day this weekend will be a washout. A rumble of thunder isn’t out of the question either. Temperatures will start to slide, though. We’ll max out around in the mid 70s on Saturday, and Sunday’s afternoon temperature will only top out in the upper 60s. Once a cold front passes through with the last of the rain on Sunday, that will bring temperatures down for next week. Highs will only be in the mid 50s for the first half of the week and morning lows on Tuesday and Wednesday will likely be in the mid 30s, meaning frost is possible those mornings.
