Like Chief Meteorologist Darby Bybee explained, the Northern Lights are caused by coronal mass ejections, or energy coming from the sun. Thursday night's geomagnetic storm was particularly intense. [Many people in Northwest Arkansas were also able to see the Northern Lights in May.](https://www.4029tv.com/article/northern-lights-northwest-arkansas-aurora-borealis-geomagnetic-storm-2024/60762011) Here are the pictures viewers shared with 40/29 from across Arkansas and Oklahoma.
