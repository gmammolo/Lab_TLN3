  "text": "- By: [Deeksha Gour](/authors/deeksha-gour) - Fri, Oct 11 2024 08:39 UTC - Source: JND Northern Lights In 2024: A remarkable solar storm is on its way to Earth, bringing the potential for breathtaking displays of the northern lights or aurora borealis, across much of the northern hemisphere. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, indicating one of the strongest levels of solar activity. This storm is expected to reach Earth by midday Thursday. The auroras, typically seen in polar regions, may now be visible in areas far beyond their usual range. Stargazers in locations from Scotland to East Anglia have already begun capturing images of this stunning phenomenon and reports suggest that the northern lights have been visible in various parts of the United States.

Some observers even spotted the auroras as far south as Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. Initially, forecasters believed the auroras would only be visible as far south as the Midlands, but the display exceeded those expectations. When and Where to See the Northern Lights The G4 storm watch indicates that the auroras may be visible across large parts of the northern U.S., offering a rare chance for residents to experience this natural wonder. NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center mentioned that if the storm reaches its predicted strength, the northern lights may be seen directly overhead in states like Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin.

The Kp index of the storm is predicted to be 8, which suggests that the auroras will be particularly bright and active. Understanding the Northern Lights The northern lights are caused by solar activity. When the sun releases bursts of plasma and charged particles known as coronal mass ejections they can interact with Earth’s magnetic field, creating this stunning light display. While geomagnetic storms can disrupt power grids and GPS signals, they also provide a unique opportunity for aurora enthusiasts to marvel at nature’s beauty.",
