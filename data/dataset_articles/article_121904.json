'The stats are looking really, really, really good.'\nThe Northern Lights may once again light up Irish skies tonight (Thursday, 10 October) with meteorology expert Carlow Weather informing the public of the chance to see the lightshow.\nThis year has seen an onslaught of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that have paraded our skies in places not often treated to the illuminating spectacle.\nEarlier this year in May, the aurora could be seen across the country and as far south as central Europe.\nAnd now, Ireland could be in for another display of the aurora borealis, according to Alan O'Reilly of Carlow Weather.\nCharger those camera batteries! A chance of Northern Lights tonight and could be a very strong display. Once it's fully dark start looking out for them. pic.twitter.com/kvIOlwCSMK — Carlow Weather (@CarlowWeather) October 10, 2024\nIn a video post, he told his followers: \"We could be in for a display of the Northern Lights. Now with these things, it's never certain. It can be big disappointment.\n\"But at the moment, the stats are looking really, really, really good.…\nStephen Porzio",
