  "text": "Arkansans might see Northern Lights Thursday night Arkansans might see Northern Lights Thursday night OF A SURPRISE IN THE SKY TONIGHT. >> THAT’S RIGHT. THE AURORA BOREALIS, NORTHERN LIGHTS. IT’S A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY. WE DID ACTUALLY SEE IT AS FAR SOUTH AS NORTHWEST ARKANSAS. PARTS OF THE RIVER VALLEY EARLIER THIS WEEK. WE’VE BEEN JUST A LOT OF ENERGY COMING FROM THE SUN RECENTLY. AND SO TONIGHT THIS IS THE FORECAST FROM NOAA AND THE EXTENT OF THAT AURORA ALL THE WAY DOWN TO NWA IN THE RIVER VALLEY, A REAL POSSIBILITY, ESPECIALLY AFTER SUNSET THROUGH ABOUT MIDNIGHT. AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY HITTING THE EARTH KIND OF STARTS TO LOWER AFTER THAT. SO WE’LL SEE. I MEAN, THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE BECAUSE IT’S VERY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS ENERGY WHEN IT GETS RELEASED BY THE SUN. THESE ARE CALLED CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS. SO IT’S A LOT OF ENERGY COMING FROM THE SUN. IT GETS LAUNCHED TOWARDS EARTH. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. BUT THIS IS A PARTICULARLY STRONG AMOUNT OF ENERGY. AND SO PARTICULARLY STRONG GEOMETRIC GEOMAGNETIC STORM IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW AND CONTINUES TONIGHT. AND THAT’S KIND OF WHAT LEADS TO ALL OF THIS. AND CERTAINLY WITH SUCH AN INTENSE EVENT. YEAH, WE MIGHT SEE A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT. SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS. WELL AWAY FROM CITY LIGHTS. NOT A LOT OF CLOUD COVER. FEW CLOUDS HERE AND THERE, BUT SHOULDN’T REALLY IMPEDE VIEWING IF THERE IS ANY OF THAT. TONIGHT THE AURORA BOREALIS. TEMPERATURES VERY WARM MID 80S IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS, MID AND EVEN A FEW UPPER 80S IN THE RIVER VALLEY THAT HEAT REALLY BUILDING IN TEMPERATURES LATER THIS EVENING IN THE 60S, SO FEELING PRETTY GOOD IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE STANDING OUTSIDE LOOKING FOR THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. A FEW SCATTERED CLOUDS, BUT WON’T BE MUCH. THERE WON’T BE ANY RAIN, SO THAT’S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. WAKING UP IN THE 50S TOMORROW MORNING, NOT AS COOL AS IT WAS THIS MORNING, BUT STILL COMFORTABLY COOL TOMORROW AFTERNOON, MID TO UPPER 80S AGAIN FOR US, EVEN HOTTER BY SATURDAY.
