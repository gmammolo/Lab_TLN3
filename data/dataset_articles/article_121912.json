  "text": "The Northern Lights made a stunning appearance across the UK last night (Thursday, October 10), lighting up the sky and dazzling sky watchers in Oldham.\nThe aurora borealis are usually influenced by geomagnetic storms which originate from activity on the Sun.\nThe phenomenon meant that Oldhamers were able to get an amazing sight of the stunning display, and people in the borough shared some amazing pictures they took.\nMartin Robinson captured this impressive snap at the top of the moors in Oldham.\n(Image: Martin Robinson)\nMeanwhile, Karen Richards shared these pictures that were taken in Moorside.\nFrom Moorside too pic.twitter.com/cohis05byh\n— 🌱Karen Richards 🪐 (@kreacher37) October 11, 2024 Tom Nokes captured these remarkable images of the Oldham sky lit up in red, green and blue.\nAbsolutely amazing!! Taken by me over Oldham tonight! @ChadWeather @BBCNWT @GranadaReports pic.twitter.com/sY0aJcgk1u\n— Tom Nokes (@TomNokes) October 10, 2024 According to the BBC, the northern lights could be seen after an extremely geomagnetic storm - G5 - which is the highest on the one to five scale.\nThe BBC also said aurora might be visible in parts of the North again tonight, but are less likely in other parts of the country, so make sure to keep an eye out.\nNorthern Lights Nature",
