  "text": "Scots who missed Thursday's spectacular [Northern Lights](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/northern-lights) display have been told not to worry - because they are set to be a common occurrence this winter. The aurora was visible all across the UK this week as Britons were delighted to see the incredible phenomenon. The lights could be seen as far south as Kent and continental [Europe](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/europe), and even in areas of high light pollution like [Glasgow](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/glasgow), they were visible to the naked eye. As ever northern parts of [Scotland](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/scotland) offered the best views as the sky was lit in magnificent shades of purple, green and red with the peak seeming to happen around 10pm. STV [weatherman](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/weather) Sean Batty was among those who spotted the lights as they glittered above his home in [Renfrewshire](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/renfrewshire). And he offered some solace to those waking on Friday to discover they had missed out. He said: \"Remember, these will likely become more common this winter and next so there’s plenty of time to catch them if you don’t manage tonight.\" Scientists say the sun is reaching the peak of its solar cycle, known as solar maximum, which occurs roughly every 11 years.

One such geomagnetic storm coupled with clear skies on Thursday and Friday morning to create the perfect conditions. Aurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere around the magnetic poles. As they collide, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky. The [Met Office](https://www.scottishdailyexpress.co.uk/all-about/met-office)'s space weather forecast suggests the impact of the solar storm could continue to Friday night but will ease throughout the day and by October 13, the Northern Lights will be \"increasingly confined to far northern geomagnetic latitudes\".
