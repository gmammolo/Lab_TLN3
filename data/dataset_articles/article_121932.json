  "text": "Coloradans had a rare sight to see earlier this year when the Northern Lights were visible from above in pretty much all of [Colorado](/tags/colorado/). If you happened to have missed out on the chance to see them in May, you might be in luck again on Thursday, October 10. You Could Possibly See The Northern Lights in Northern Colorado According to everyone's favorite Colorado weather guy, Denver & Front Range Weather, there is going to be a pretty good chance you can see them again. The best part about this happening during this time of the year is that the sun sets much earlier than it did in May. The Space Weather Prediction Center says that there is a Severe G4 geomagnetic storm underway and this is what causes the Northern Lights. So if you want to see the Northern Lights for the first time or again in Colorado, check the skies this evening as we could be in for quite the show. Your best chance of seeing the Northern Lights in Colorado is to head to a location that is away from towns and cities. When my wife and I took off to hunt the Northern Lights in May, we were near the Pawnee National Grassland in Weld County. Being able to witness the Northern Lights in person was simply amazing. The way the beams of light danced in the sky was something everyone should see in their lifetime.
