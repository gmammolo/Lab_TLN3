  "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) -\nHot sunshine for Friday & the weekend\nMostly sunny skies will be with the ArkLaTex throughout Friday. There is a slim 10% chance of rain for SE OK & NE TX today while the rest of the region stays completely dry. High temperatures get up to the upper 80′s and lower 90′s.\nThe weekend provides plenty of sunshine ahead for both days with not a drop of rain in sight. High temperatures ramp up each day with high’s on Saturday reaching the lower 90′s and high’s on Sunday reaching the mid 80′s.\nSunshine rolls on all of next work week as we look to continue our dry stretch of weather. The next chance of rain might come the following weekend, but we’ll see. High temperatures drop a lot next week. High’s slightly cool into the mid to upper 80′s for Monday before falling into the mid to upper 70′s for Tuesday. High’s then look to stay around that mark for the rest of the work week with low temperatures dipping into the 40′s by Wednesday morning.\nHave a fantastic Friday & a great sunny weekend!\n- Meteorologist Evan Thomason\nCopyright 2024 KSLA.
