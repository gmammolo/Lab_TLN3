  "text": "What a difference a year makes when it comes to the Maple City Fall Festival. After soggy, chilly conditions kept down festival crowds and challenged vendors in 2023, the forecast for Saturday's fifth edition of the autumn shindig couldn't be better. Look for a mix of sun and clouds, afternoon temperatures in the low to mid 60s and almost no threat of rain on Saturday in Hornell, according AccuWeather . If that weather outlook holds true, it should make for a bustling scene in downtown Hornell, where the event takes place from noon to 6 p.m. There will be all the things you expect at a fall festival, including food trucks, dozens of food and craft vendors, games, free activities for children and families, and live music. Hornell Partners for Growth , which sponsors the festival, said the event has grown each year and Saturday's participation should be the most robust yet. In addition to places to buy stuff, many community groups and organizations will have a presence on Main Street, sharing information about their causes and how to get involved. \"Through events like the Maple City Fall Festival, we strive to bring the community together and celebrate all that makes Hornell a great place to live and work,\" said Valorie Whitehill, HPG executive director. \"I am extremely grateful for the support of many local businesses and individuals who provided sponsorships to make the 5th annual Maple City Fall Festival happen,\" she added. The 2024 festival has benefited from some good fortune already. For much of the year, the festival wasn't on the schedule because it appeared unfeasible while Hornell's $2.9 million streetscape project was in progress . But organizers said the construction project moved along faster than expected, and HPG announced in August that the festival would take place after all. Making plans to be in Hornell Saturday? Here are a couple more things to know before you go. More: 'Sinister' Andover Haunted House has 'over the top' scares in its 27th year. What to know.
