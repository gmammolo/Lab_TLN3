  "text": "The Northern Lights have lit up the skies across the UK as far down as the south east.\nPhotos of the lights , known as aurora borealis, were captured across Surrey, Sussex and Kent on Thursday night.\nIt was the strongest and most widespread showing of the phenomenon since May, according to BBC Weather.\nBBC Lead Weather Presenter Simon King said: \"What used to be a once-in-a-lifetime event for people to see it in the UK – or a bucket list trip to the Arctic circle – has become more common in the last couple of years.\"\nMeteorologists advise a long exposure camera is used to capture the auroras, as the phenomenon is not always visible with the naked eye.\nHere is a selection of some of the best images sent to BBC South East.\nCoastal JJ Medmerry Mill in Selsey, West Sussex Sarah Browne Brighton seafront, East Sussex Daisy Goodwin Henfield, West Sussex Christian Alan Broadstairs, Kent Sam Dixon French/BBC Horsham, West Sussex Julia Abbott/BBC Godalming, Surrey Nathalie Edell/BBC Ringmer, East Sussex Rachel Kiley Cuckmere, East Sussex Andrew Hatton Sevenoaks, Kent Trish Abbott Charing, Kent Grazyna Hammond Eastbourne, East Sussex Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook , on X , and on Instagram .
