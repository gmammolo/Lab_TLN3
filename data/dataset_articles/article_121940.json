  "text": "The Northern Lights dazzled residents across the north-west of England as they cascaded in vivid pinks, purple and green.\nAlso known as aurora borealis, the lights were seen across the UK where they have been increasingly visible this year due to the biggest geomagnetic storm since 2003.\nLast night, according to BBC Weather, it was the strongest and most widespread showing of the phenomenon in the UK since May.\nThose taking photographs are advised to use a long exposure camera to capture the auroras, as it is not always visible with the eye.\nAlex Bown Altrincham, Greater Manchester Eva Southport, Merseyside Paul Walmsley Grindleton fell near Clitheroe, Lancashire Andy Roe Banks, Lancashire Sonia Bashir Moor Park in Preston, Lancashire John Richardson Leigh, Greater Manchester Joanne Greer Fleetwood, Lancashire Simon Ricketts Pendle Hill, Lancashire Emily Morgan Longridge, Lancashire Listen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook , X and Instagram .
