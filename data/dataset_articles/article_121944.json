  "text": "WASHINGTON STATE — 2024 has been the year of the Aurora Borealis , and another spectacular show fired off around the globe Thursday night. Partly cloudy skies couldn't stop photographers from capturing the beautiful sky colors in the Puget Sound region, although morning fog obscured the show for early risers. The reason 2024 has been so active for aurora viewing is because we are in the peak of an 11-year cycle of solar activity. The last time we were in the midst of such a cycle, neither cell phones nor social media were as prevalent. These days, word about an aurora display spreads quickly online, and most of us are armed with a phone camera that, when pointed to the night sky, can quickly make out the shimmering curtains of colors that our naked eye cannot. Thursday night's storm was rated as a G4 with corresponding Kp ratings between 8 and 9--similar to the severity of the round that erupted in May . For all northern lights viewing, the best experience is in dark areas away from the city light pollution to the north. A camera lens will better pick up the waving colors in the night sky. After Thursday’s stunning display of the northern lights, many are wondering if it'll be as vibrant this weekend. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center continued the geomagnetic storm watch through the end of the day Friday, as the effect of an ejection of high-energy plasma from the sun on the earth's magnetic field continues to diminish. Day by day, geomagnetic storm activity is expected to taper to “minor” on Saturday with even less activity for Sunday. ALSO SEE | Stunning aurora lights up skies in unusual locations, from Germany to NYC The Kp index, a measure of geomagnetic activity and a gauge on how likely you are to see the northern lights, from Thursday night was between 8-9, to 5 on Friday and expected to be a 3 Saturday. With lower numbers reflecting a dimmer aurora with viewing limited to farther north. Still, if you'd like to try your hand at viewing more northern lights Friday and Saturday nights, take a shot! Leave the city lights as the clouds clear and look north. Early Saturday morning, fog in spots may obstruct your stargazing. What are the northern lights? Our brilliant aurora shows begin about 93 million miles away on the surface of the sun. At times, a sunspot cluster will erupt into a complex called a “solar storm,” emitting huge bursts of energy in the form of flares and expulsions of magnetic field and plasma. These bursts are known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. The CMEs pull away from the sun and hurl into space. The size, speed, and strength of a CME can vary greatly. CMEs typically arrive at Earth in three to five days, but the fastest have been found to reach our planet in as little as 15 to 18 hours! Once here, the ejected energy and plasma, and the embedded magnetic field, interacts with our earth’s atmosphere. This disruption results in an exchange of energy from the solar wind into our earth’s magnetosphere, and is known as a ‘Geomagnetic Storm.’ The Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The SWPC keeps track of solar flares and geomagnetic storms and has developed a scale similar to those for hurricanes and tornadoes, so as to keep tabs on these disturbances and communicate their intensity to the public. Part of the scale is based on a ‘K’ index, sometimes called a ‘Planetary-K’ index, stylized as “Kp.” This reading quantifies the horizontal movement in the earth’s magnetic field over three-hour intervals, with 0 being totally calm (marked by green), and five or more indicating a geomagnetic storm is occurring (marked by red). The top of the scale is 9, reflecting an extreme storm. The colors, intensity, shape, and coverage of an aurora borealis event correlate to the Kp index as such: Kp0 means we might see faint green, from Kp3 we might see some yellows, Kp4 brings pink, Kp5 brings blue and purple, and at Kp8 red becomes part of the mix. Thus, greens are common with lower Kp values, but the blues, purples, and red become visible in only more intense Geomagnetic storms. In the severe Geomagnetic storm that occurred in May of 2024, SWPC’s planetary K-index showed that the Kp index reached between 8 and 9 in the early morning hours of May 11. While the Kp index measures the movement in the magnetic field, the overall impacts of a geomagnetic storm, including disruptions to power grids, GPS, and communications systems, are also measured by SWPC, with the ‘G scale.’ The scale goes from G1-G5, with G1 corresponding to Kp5 and G5 to a Kp9. G5 storms are rare. Until the massive rounds of aurora borealis in May of 2024, a G5 storm hadn’t been observed since 2003. Because severe geomagnetic storms have the potential to affect global navigation satellite systems, scientists work to understand how to improve those systems during such storms. Green northern lights are by far the most common. They become visible when the oxygen in the lower atmosphere gets excited by the changes in the magnetosphere. Reds are generally only seen in the higher latitudes (think of all of those brilliant pinks and reds you’ve seen photographed in northern Europe) unless the solar storm is very intense. Similarly, blues and purples are more rare, and only show themselves in the stronger solar storms. Blue aurora is the result of ionized nitrogen molecules. The aurora breakout of May 2024 led to the visibility of the entire aurora spectrum in the mid-latitudes. CMEs—and thus, the resultant “Northern Lights,” are fairly common. Social media has made that apparent, as even photographers in Western Washington (not just Norway and Finland!) are able to capture them several times a year, sharing documentation on X, YouTube, and other platforms. In order to see the aurora borealis, you’ll have the best luck if: SkunkBayWeather.com sits on a property at the very northern reach of the Kitsap Peninsula, and its north-facing webcams capture the Northern Lights on a regular basis. However, geomagnetic storms aren’t often strong enough such that the Northern Lights are visible all throughout the United States. The G5 level storm in 2024 resulted in an aurora observed as far south as California and Florida. Usually at our latitude, only the fainter greens are easy to spot. During the May 2024 solar storm, many Washingtonians were amazed by the waving curtains of pinks and purples in the mix, too. While the naked eye cannot see the full range of colors in the night sky, personal cameras, including those on mobile phones, were able to capture the brilliant colors of the aurora borealis in Iceland and Alaska, and also right here in Western Washington. Your camera lens can pick up far more color and light than the lens of your eye, especially if it’s set up with a long exposure. This tip is often communicated by broadcasters and NWS meteorologists, so as to keep everyone’s expectations within reason.",
