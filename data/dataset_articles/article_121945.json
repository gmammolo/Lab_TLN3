  "text": "SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) -The northerly flow of air left in the wake of Milton will continue for several more days. Humidity will increase a bit in the afternoons, but in the evening and overnight we will see temperatures fall into the into the comfortable upper 60s to lower 70s. For those without air conditioning the dewpoints in the lower to mid 60s will combine with the afore mentioned temperatures to produce very comfortable overnights.\nDry weather will also be in the forecast. If you need to do debri removal or home repairs you can count on at least a week of rain free skies. The dry air will also bring mostly sunny conditions accompanied by a breezy wind. In short. The week ahead looks to be a very comfortable string of October days.\nThere has been talk on social media regarding a storm developing and once again hitting Florida. The major computer models do not support this viral tail. The American model does develop a low pressure system over the Yucatan Peninsula in 12 days, but is alone in this regard. In any event, the 12 day forecast has very little if any skill.\nCopyright 2024 WWSB. All rights reserved.",
