  "text": "Photo: X/ @omney Friday, October 11\nNorthern lights illuminate the night skies over Berlin\nLast night, the skies above Berlin lit up. Vast illuminations of pink, purple, green and blue could be seen as the rare celestial phenomenon of the northern lights shone in the midnight sky. The solar spectacle was visible in Berlin and the northern part of Brandenburg until clouds rolled in at some point in the early hours of the morning and ended the spectacle.\nAlso known as aurora borealis, the northern lights occur when solar particles like electrons and protons are thrown up by violent eruptions on the surface of the sun. As they arrive in the earth’s atmosphere they ionise, emitting light of various colours and complexities. Normally these colours are only visible in the far north, but periodically such solar spectacles become visible at other latitudes due to particularly strong solar activity.\nAnd there might be more coming. 2025 is predicted to be a year of strong solar activity, so Berliners may expect to see more of the aurora borealis.",
