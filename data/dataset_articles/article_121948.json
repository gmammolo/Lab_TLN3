  "text": "Cold front Monday, brings even cooler temperatures by midweek, next week. MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Cool nights and mornings continue into the weekend, all giving way to sunny, warm and comfortable afternoons both Saturday and Sunday. A cold front arrives Monday, while it could squeeze out a shower. The big story with this front will be the colder temperatures that will arrive by midweek next week. Out-the-door this morning expect a clear sky, temperatures in the 50s with some upper 40s sprinkled in and light winds. By this afternoon, expect wall-to-wall sunshine. Highs will warm into the upper 70s to lower 80s. Winds will be out of the east around 5 to 10 mph, becoming light tonight. Lows will dip into the 40s and 50s overnight, all under a clear sky and light winds. Picture perfect, fall weather is expected this weekend. Afternoon highs Saturday will warm into the lower 80s, while afternoon highs rebound back into the upper 80s by Sunday.

Please note, this stream does not include live severe weather coverage, only data on the latest weather conditions. A cold front is projected to move across the region on Monday. That could squeeze out a shower or two, but the front is looking mainly dry as it passes. A few clouds will be possible to start next week, with highs remaining in the middle to upper 80s and lows in the 50s and 60s. The big story with the aforementioned front, will be the drop in temperatures. As the coldest air of the Fall season will arrive. Afternoon highs Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday will be in the lower to middle 70s, with overnight lows in the 40s and 50s. Each day will feature sunny afternoons and clear overnights. First Alert Update: The forecast is looking dry over the next 7 to 10 days. We could use the rain, as the latest drought monitor issued Thursday morning shows much of Alabama under abnormally to moderate drought conditions. Which will only worsen as the dry weather persists. Tracking the Tropics: Milton has officially dissipated and is no longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center. Tropical Storm Leslie is still churning in the Atlantic Ocean. Movement is north and then east, meaning it will remain in the ocean and NOT impact the United States. The NHC is monitoring a potential area that has a medium chance for development over the next week. This area they are watching is off the coast of Africa and thousands of miles away from the United States. Copyright 2024 WSFA. All rights reserved.",
