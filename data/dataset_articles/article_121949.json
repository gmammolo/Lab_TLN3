  "text": "Stunning photos: Northern lights dazzled in the Carolina skies Pictures showed colorful aurora across North Carolina CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A beautiful sight took over the Carolina skies late Thursday night into early Friday morning as a severe geomagnetic storm helped make the northern lights visible much further south than usual. Photos were sent in from across North Carolina, including from Statesville, Salisbury, Boone, Waxhaw, Monroe, Mocksville, Charlotte and Wrightsville Beach, to name a few. Viewers in many other communities sent in pictures as well. The aurora, which was visible due to a G4 geomagnetic storm – the second-most severe – lit the sky with various shades of pinks, purples, greens and blues. In Boone, one photographer tagged WBTV in an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DA94cHYR5yA/?img_index=1) with the caption: “After the past 2 weeks, my heart needed this. I felt myself get excited! This is unreal!!!!” While the current geomagnetic storm watch was set to expire Friday, the highest levels of geomagnetic activity occurred Thursday night. Some photos can be seen in the post below, with plenty more viewable [here](https://ugc.zeam.com/app/gallery?albumId=1555).
