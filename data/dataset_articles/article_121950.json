  "text": "We’ve got an amazing mid-October weekend on the way as strong high pressure keeps wet weather systems away. Thin high clouds will come and go at times, especially tonight and Friday. Otherwise expect more sunshine than clouds both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures rise a bit, reaching 5-10° above normal for this time of the year. The closest showers will be down in southern Oregon or northern California.\nEarth is currently experiencing a geomagnetic storm that arrived around 8am this morning . That’s an “assault” on the earth’s magnetic field due to energy coming from the sun. Intensity has been coming and going all day, but is back to G4 (SEVERE) level at 3pm. Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) have been seen on the dark side of the planet the past few hours, all the way down to quite low latitudes. So, IF the storm continues, there’s a decent chance those curtains of green/pink/red light could appear again at some point after dark . We don’t know when they will be visible, just that conditions are primed for that to occur. Location doesn’t matter around the region since all areas will see thin high clouds. But you should be away from city lights for the best view. Just like in May, something spectacular could show up for 10 minutes and then it’s quiet the rest of the night. Or maybe it comes and goes all night.\nWe see a change in the weather next week, starting with more clouds Monday and then rain showers Tuesday. This will be the first period this fall where we expect several days of showers/rain. It’s too early to know if this is the beginning of the wet season, but late October we usually DO see a switch to cloudier, cooler, and wetter weather as the jet stream gets closer. Make sure you finish up any outdoor projects by Monday if you need to do so while it’s still dry .\nCopyright 2024 KPTV-KPDX. All rights reserved.",
