  "text": "Some rain is expected overnight on Saturday in parts of Kurzeme and Vidzeme, but after that, the weekend will pass without precipitation. Clouds will be scarce on Saturday but will increase from the west on Sunday. A slow to moderate south-westerly wind will blow on Saturday, while on Sunday a south-easterly breeze will pick up, gusty at times in Kurzeme. Minimum temperatures will be +2 C to +7 C on the weekend nights, with frosts on Saturday morning, mainly in eastern Vidzeme and Latgale down to 0 C, with frosts expected at grass height, and warmer temperatures of +8 C to +11 C overnight on Saturday in many parts of the coast. The air temperatures will be +11 C to +14 C on weekend afternoons. Early next week, the weather will turn grey again, with more overcast skies, less sunshine, and occasional rain. Days will become slightly cooler, with maximum temperatures of 7-12 C, but drier, sunnier weather will start from mid-week. Nights will be cold and frosty, while days will be moderately warm.",
