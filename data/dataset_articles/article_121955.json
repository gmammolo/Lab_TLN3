  "text": "There was a stunning display of colour on Thursday night as the Northern Lights put on a show.\nAccording to BBC Weather, it was the strongest and most widespread exhibition of the phenomenon in the UK since May.\nHowever, we are unlikely to get such a show in the Midlands on Friday, as solar activity is expected to weaken.\nHere are some of the best examples of photos from across the region.\nsabphotos69 / BBC Weather Watchers Enville, Staffordshire Otto the dog / BBC Weather Watchers Walsall Josh / BBC Weather Watchers Malvern, Worcestershire From about 19:00 BST many people were able to see the Northern Lights, also called the aurora borealis.\nNot everyone in the region could see the display, which was often clearer on cameras than with the naked eye.\nThe phenomenon is caused when charged particles from the sun hit gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the North poles.\nJack March / BBC Weather Watchers Stockingford, Warwickshire Eric / BBC Weather Watchers Bloxwich Andrew Fusek Peters Walcot Lake, Shropshire Views of the northern Lights have become more common in the UK in recent years.\nHow far south they can be seen is determined by the level of solar activity.\nThe lowest part of an aurora is typically 50 miles (80 km) above the Earth's surface. The highest part could be 150 miles (800km) above the Earth.\nPhil Harrison / BBC Weather Watchers Worcester Snaphappydave / BBC Weather Watchers Kinver, Staffordshire Thursday night's display was caused by a G5 solar storm - the highest on the 1-5 scale.\nBut such storms can also interfere with satellites and power grids around the world.\nThe Northern Lights have been visible several times during the year.\nIf you want to take photos of them, meteorologists advise using a long exposure camera.\nGraham's Vista / BBC Weather Watchers Sutton Coldfield CaineWolf / BBC Weather Watchers Wolverhampton We love to feature your photographs from across the West Midlands.\nUpload your images via BBC Weather Watchers or email us at midlandstoday@bbc.co.uk .\nFor inspiration, view some top tips from three of England's Big Picture photographers.\nFollow for more pictures on Instagram from BBC Birmingham , BBC Coventry & Warwickshire , BBC Hereford & Worcester , BBC Shropshire , BBC Stoke & Staffordshire and BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country .\nMore on this story Northern Lights shimmer over UK in stunning photos Eyes to the skies for Northern Lights spectacle What are the Northern Lights?
