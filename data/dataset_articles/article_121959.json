  "text": "First Alert Forecast: Gorgeous weekend; much cooler next week Lots of sunshine, warm afternoons ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - It will be sunny and gorgeous this afternoon as highs warm to the mid 70s. The gorgeous weather will continue all weekend...so be sure to go outside, and enjoy! :) Overnight tonight, lows will again drop into the mid 40s to low 50s, so it will be chilly start to the weekend. The weekend will bring a continuation of our gorgeous weather. Expect cool mornings and warm afternoons paired with lots of sunshine. High temperatures will climb into the mid 70s Saturday and low 80s Sunday. Come next Monday, a front will begin to move into North Georgia. This front will bring a big drop in temperatures, resulting in a First Alert Weather Day Wednesday. Temperatures Wednesday morning will drop into the 40s with highs only in the mid to upper 60s! We will wake up in the 40s Thursday morning again, but highs will make it back into the low 70s late next week.
