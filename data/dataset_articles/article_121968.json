  "text": "WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Communities across southeastern North Carolina were treated to a spectacular light show Thursday, Oct. 11, as the aurora borealis painted the evening sky. Some may have been able to see it with their bare eyes, but long-exposure photographs revealed the breathtaking sight in greater detail. Many viewers submitted their photographs to WECT, some of which can be viewed below. Did you take a great picture or have an awesome video? We want to see it! Click here to upload them ! You also can find See It, Snap It, Send It on the WECT News app. Just click on Sections and scroll down to See It, Snap It, Send It! “The aurora is formed from interactions between the solar wind streaming out from the sun and Earth’s protective magnetic field, or magnetosphere,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains. “The aurora is one manifestation of geomagnetic activity or geomagnetic storms. “As the solar wind increases in speed and the interplanetary magnetic field embedded in the solar wind turns southward, the geomagnetic activity will increase and the aurora will become brighter, more active, and move further from the poles. Even moderate solar wind creates aurora so there is usually a weak aurora somewhere even when there isn’t a big geomagnetic storm.” More information about the aurora borealis can be found here .
