  "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - First Alert AccuTrack shows a quiet and clear sky across Central Alabama as we kick off your Friday. The tranquil, cloud-free weather made for great viewing conditions for a rare celestial event: the Northern Lights! A strong geomagnetic storm allowed the aurora to be seen as far south as the Bahamas, so make sure you send in any photos you were able to capture last night on the WBRC First Alert Weather App . The chance to see the lights will be much lower tonight, but the weather for today will be fantastic. As high pressure settles in over Alabama, the day will start off cool in the 50s but climb comfortably to near 80 this afternoon under plenty of sunshine. Just made sure you have the jacket for any high school football games tonight. The weekend forecast will remain quiet and pleasant, a perfect excuse to get outside and enjoy the fall weather! Morning lows will be seasonable in the 50s with afternoons warmer than average in the low to mid 80s.\nWBRC Strong Cold Front (WBRC) Sideline Forecast (WBRC)\nNext Big Thing: A strong cold front will sweep through the Deep South on Monday, ushering in some of the coolest temperatures we’ve seen thus far for the fall season. The front will be “moisture-starved,” so the chance of squeezing out a few showers on Monday looks unlikely. We could see a few passing clouds on Tuesday, but other than that, the front will move through without incident. We may be able to at least briefly officially pull the trigger on sweater weather for a few days! After topping out in the upper 70s on Monday, high temperatures will only climb into the upper 60s to low 80s on Tuesday through Thursday.\nWe have a First Alert for the possibility of some patchy frost areas north on Wednesday and Thursday mornings; most of us will see temperatures fall into the 40s, but some of our typically cooler spots could even drop into the upper 30s! Temperatures should eventually turn more seasonable again by NEXT weekend, but we still don’t see any signs of decent rainfall in the forecast. This is nothing unusual for October, which is typically the driest month of the year in Central Alabama.\nTropical Update: Milton has dissipated now that it’s moved back farther out into the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Leslie continues to gradually weaken out in the middle of the ocean as it remains a “fish storm.” Our next area to watch though is a disturbance off of the west coast of Africa that has a medium chance of development over the next 48 hours. Some of our long-range models hint this potential system could eventually end up in the western Atlantic by the end of next week, but no immediate concerns for our neck of the woods. We have also been seeing hints of some tropical activity in the Caribbean over the next 7-10 days, but nothing is set in stone for now. Bottom line? No major threats for the Gulf Coast at this time — a welcome reprieve in the wake of Milton and Helene. Hurricane season runs through November 30th.\nTropical Update (WBRC) Make sure you download the WBRC First Alert Weather App for the most up-to-date forecast.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.
