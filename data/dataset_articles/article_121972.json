  "text": "Happy Friday morning! Morning lows are a few degrees cooler this morning with lows in the mid to upper 40s with clear skies. We will be mostly sunny today. High temperatures will be in the low 80s to upper 70s with breezy conditions. Expect southwest winds of 8-12 mph with gusts up to 25-30 mph at times. The winds will increase the concern of brush/field fires across the viewing area.\nDrought conditions will continue, elevating the fire threat outside. Low humidity and dry vegetation could give way to fires that spread quickly. Be cautious if you do any outdoor burning. Have a water hose nearby or possibly a bucket of water. Some counties are underneath burn bans. To see if your county is under a ban, go to the\nIndiana Dept. of Homeland Security’s Website or click, here.\nSaturday, morning lows will be warmer, in the mid to lower 50s. Low 80s to upper 70s will be likely for highs with a bit more clouds during the day. A cold front will work through Saturday night and Sunday morning. This passage may allow a few scattered to isolated storms to move through after 7-9 PM Saturday.\nThis front will usher in much colder air Monday through much of next week. Sunday's highs will be in the lower 70s. Monday through Wednesday's highs will be in the 50s to around 60 by the middle of the week. Lows will be around freezing Tues-Thurs, which could give way to widespread frost in our viewing area.",
