  "text": "The air quality has cleared up nicely for the weekend! Our Air Quality Advisory over Deschutes County is set to expire today and we’ll see good to moderate air quality, which is acceptable.\nWe had nice, crisp, near normal temperatures yesterday but a ridge of high pressure is building over our region again and will keep us above normal through the first half of next week.\nToday, we heat up a little from yesterday, back into the low and mid 70s. We’ll be under mostly cloudy skies again today but they’ll clear up tomorrow just in time for your weekend plans. Lows will be in the 30s and 40s. Tomorrow, we cool a degree or two into in the low 70s with sunny skies. Sunday and Monday we’ll heat up again, a few areas could reach those upper 70s.\nBy mid next week, temperatures drop quite a bit! We have a chance of seeing some rain Wednesday and some decent snow on our mountains the following day. Current models are showing a bit of a wintry mix even reaching us here on the eastern slopes. This is still a bit of a ways out, but it could be the “big weather event” that officially ends our fire season. Who’s ready for ski and snowboarding season to start already? We'll continue to track it for you here.\nHappy Friday, Have a fantastic weekend. Continue to keep an eye out for the hidden pumpkin in my forecast.\nDon’t forget to download the KTVZ weather app to stay safe and informed.\niOS:  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ktvz-local-alert-weather-app/id1088330817\nAndroid:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ktvz.android.weather&hl=en_US",
