  "text": "The skies above Gloucestershire were lit up with bright pinks, purples and green hues last night in an incredible display . If you weren&apos;t one of the lucky ones to catch a glimpse of the stunning Northern Lights last night, tonight (October 11) might be your second chance.\nThere could be chance of seeing them again tonight, as the Met Office says a \"coronal mass ejection from the sun is earth bound\" again. The Met Office has revealed the best times to get out and try to see the stunning phenomenon.\nThe forecasters have said the skies will begin to clear later while the east of the region remains covered. The map from the Met Office shows that the Northern Lights may be seen across the UK from 7pm, if it is dark enough, and it may be visible until the early hours of Saturday morning.\nA spokesman for the Met Office said there had been \"more space weather events in recent months\", including the Northern Lights, because the sun was nearing the peak of its solar cycle. This comes after some amazing displays in the South West back in May.\nThe Northern Lights, formally known as an Aurora Borealis, are caused by activity on the surface of the sun and are usually only visible in the poles or surrounding area.\nThe Northern Lights are a consequence of solar activity as millions of charged light particles collide with molecules in the Earth&apos;s upper atmosphere. The Met Office explained: \"Oxygen gives off green light when it is hit 60 miles above the Earth, whilst at 100-200 miles rare, all-red Auroras are produced. Nitrogen causes the sky to glow blue yet when higher in the atmosphere the glow has a purple hue.\"\nWhile the Met Office has warned that cloud coverage may reduce the chances of seeing the Aurora tonight, there is still the possibility of seeing the lights. It said: \"Cloudier skies tonight will limit the chances of seeing the #northernlights , however Scotland offers the best chance of seeing the Aurora\".\nThe northern lights are best seen in darkness, away from any light pollution. The lights generally extend from 50 miles to as high as 400 miles above the Earth&apos;s surface.\nFor the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights, any area away from light pollution, possibly along the north facing coast, are the best locations to watch the display. The Aurora Borealis is most active during the Equinox in March and Aril and the Solstice in September and October.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
