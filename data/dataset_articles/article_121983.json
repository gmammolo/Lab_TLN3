NOT A LOT OF LEAVES FALLING AS OF YET, BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION, ESPECIALLY WITH THE COOL MORNINGS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. HIGH TEMPERATURES DURING THE AFTERNOON. A PLEASANT DAY CLOSE TO 70 AND THEN WARMING UP A BIT THIS WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES ARE CLIMBING TOMORROW AND THEN INTO SUNDAY BEFORE MORE COOL AIR STARTS TO PUSH IN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. COOL ENOUGH THIS MORNING THAT SOME COULD SEE SOME FROST. WE HAVE SEVERAL AREAS IN THE 30S THIS MORNING. MOST OF THE AREA IN THE 40S, THOUGH A COOL FRIDAY JUST LIKE THURSDAY WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES MOVING IN THIS WEEKEND WE HAVE ANOTHER BLAST OF FALL AIR BEGINNING TO MOVE IN NEXT WEEK, DROPPING HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR A FEW DAYS, 2 OR 3 DAYS CLOSER TO 60. EVEN IN THE TRIAD. THIS IS WHAT’S LEFT OF MILTON. NO LONGER A TROPICAL ENTITY, BUT STILL A FORCE. IT IS STILL MOVING VERY QUICKLY, ALMOST DUE EAST THROUGH THE ATLANTIC, AWAY FROM LAND AND INTO THE OPEN WATERS. AND SO THERE’S GOOD NEWS THERE. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO MOVE OUT OF THE GREAT LAKES. AND THEN DOWN ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION. THIS IS COLD, DRY AIR. THE CENTER OF WHICH KEEPING THOSE WINDS LIGHT, ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO DROP TO NEAR THE FREEZING MARK OVER MUCH OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, NORTHEAST AND DOWN THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIAN CHAIN. WE’LL WARM UP WHEN WE’RE IN THIS SECTOR AHEAD OF OUR NEXT FRONT. THAT COMES THROUGH ON MONDAY. THIS COULD BRING A FEW EXTRA CLOUDS AND THE CHANCE FOR A SHOWER, BUT CHILLY AIR STARTS TO MOVE IN BEHIND THAT KIND OF COMPLICATED SYSTEM AND DROPS OUR TEMPERATURES. THAT WILL BE THE FORCE THAT DROPS OUR TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEK. BACK TO THE FROST ADVISORY IN PLACE FOR ALL NORTH CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE UNTIL 9:00 THIS MORNING. CARROLL, GRAYSON, ASHE, ALLEGHANY AND WATAUGA COUNTIES. SOME OF THOSE AREAS HAVE TEMPERATURES AS LOW AS THE MID 30S. THAT’S WHERE YOU ARE IN BOONE THIS MORNING, TWO DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING. WE’RE ALSO AT 37 IN NORTH WILKESBORO, AS WELL AS MARTINSVILLE THIS MORNING AND 39 IN ROCKINGHAM COUNTY NEAR EDEN. SO CERTAINLY WORTHY OF AN EXTRA LAYER OR TWO THIS MORNING IF IF YOU’RE GOING TO THE FAIR TODAY, FINAL WEEKEND OF THE FAIR, THEY’VE HAD A NICE STRETCH OF WEATHER THIS WEEK AND THAT’S GOING TO CONTINUE TODAY. 50S WHEN GATES OPEN AT 11:00 THIS MORNING. BUT WARMING TO NEAR 70 MID AFTERNOON. IF YOU’RE GOING TO BE THERE LATER ON THIS EVENING, WE’LL HAVE TEMPERATURES THAT WILL BE IN THE UPPER 50S FOR THAT. SO CERTAINLY A LAYERING TYPE OF DAY WARM IN THE AFTERNOON. YOU CAN PUT THOSE LAYERS AWAY. WEST WINDS AT 3 TO 5MPH. SO GENERALLY ON THE LIGHT SIDE OF THINGS NICE DAY IN THE FOOTHILLS. AFTER A CHILLY START, TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR 70 AS WELL WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 60S ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN WEST. NICE DAY ACROSS THE BOARD AND I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE STILL CLEANING UP. SO YOU WANT THE WEATHER TO COOPERATE. FOR FOLKS HEADED TO HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES THIS EVENING WILL BE IN THE 60S, COUPLE HOURS BEFORE KICKOFF. BUT NOTICE THE SHARP DROP IN TEMPERATURES. SO A BLANKET ON THOSE CHILLY ALUMINUM BLEACHERS MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA. WE’VE GOT PRETTY CLEAR SKIES IN PLACE FOR THE WEEKEND. TOUGH TO BUY A CLOUD OUT THERE UNTIL SUNDAY. WE’LL SEE A FEW PASSING BY, BUT OTHERWISE BLUE SKIES THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND WARMER WEATHER TOO. HIGHS GETTING BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S. LOOKING AHEAD INTO OCTOBER, WE’VE GOT A STRETCH OF DRY WEATHER THAT’S LIKELY GOING TO LAST FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND THEN WARMER WEATHER BEGINS TO MOVE IN TOWARD THE END OF THIS MONTH. YOU DON’T SEE IT VERY MUCH IN THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST WIL\nAdvertisement\nWATCH: Fine fall Triad days warm up a bit this weekend\nMeteorologist Brian Slocum has your weeeknd forecast\nLots of sunny days are in the forecast for the next 2 weeks, but high temperatures will be up and down\nLots of sunny days are in the forecast for the next 2 weeks, but high temperatures will be up and down\nAdvertisement",
