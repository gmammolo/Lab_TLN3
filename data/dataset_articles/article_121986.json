Image: Cormac Downes Skygazers across Wales have been treated to a stunning show of the Northern Lights – with experts saying there is still more to come.\nThe sun has now entered its period of greatest activity, which means we could be seeing more colourful displays of the aurora borealis until the middle of next year.\nHope you enjoy these timelapses showing last nights EPIC northern lights display over Wales. Did you see it?\n📌 Mwnt, Llangrannog, Dryslwyn Castle #astrophotography #aurora #auroraborealis #northernlights @TamithaSkov @TweetAurora @Luminar_Neo @BBCWalesNews @ProfBrianCox pic.twitter.com/aHa58H9t8e\n— Mathew Browne (@mathewbrowne) October 11, 2024\nOur home star typically follows an 11-year-cycle, with periods of intense activity followed by a quiet phase.\nCollision\nDuring its active bursts, also known as solar maximum, the sun releases charged particles that travel through space at speeds of around one million miles per hour.\nGoleuni’r Gogledd Y Fenni / Northern Lights, Abergavenny.
