  "text": "The Northern Lights have once again been visible across large swathes of north-east England and Cumbria.\nAccording to BBC Weather, it was the strongest and most widespread show of lights in the UK since May.\nThe phenomenon, also known as aurora borealis, occurs when charged particles from the Sun collide with gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the magnetic poles. Scientists have likened it to \"a big sneeze by the Sun\" .\nAs the particles collide with the gases, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky.\nPeople from across the region sent images to the BBC.\nHoly Island, at Northumberland, saw particularly vivid skies, while the Lake District was another spot for dramatic illuminations.\nPA Media The refuge hut on the causeway leading to Holy Island, Northumberland Mark Hetherington Warnscale Bothy in Buttermere, Cumbria Ian McClelland Newbottle, Sunderland PA Media Holy Island, Northumberland Daphne Eddington Braithwaite, Cumbria Mark Hetherington Tewet Tarn near Keswick, Cumbria Jonathan Kellager Cullercoats, North Tyneside Nigel Craig Threlkeld, Cumbria Carolyn Farthing-Dunn Shotley Bridge, County Durham B Dabbous Yarm, Stockton-on-Tees Follow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram .
