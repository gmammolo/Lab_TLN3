  "text": "EAST TEXAS (KLTV/KTRE) - Our Friday is off to a cool start in the 50s with mostly clear skies. Southeast winds, sunshine, and dry air will allow for a very easy warm up today which will place highs for most around or even above 90°. Skies will remain dry for the most part today, although northwesterly flow overhead could potentially carry a stray shower or two our way. While rain may be possible on a very low-end scale today, it is important to remember that most of it will likely evaporate through the dry air in place as it falls down to the ground. Our warming trend is only getting started today, meaning we’ll trend even hotter over the weekend. Expect highs on Saturday and Sunday to range in the lower to middle 90s with mostly sunny skies. Thankfully, there is some relief in sight! A potent fall cold front will move in on Monday, leading to a decent cool down for the majority of next week! Models are still trying to get a good grip on the cooler air as it gets closer, but current trends place high temperatures in the 70s for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday! This means that the cool and crisp mornings will return for the second half of next week as well. Something to look forward to while we watch the mercury rise over the weekend.\nCopyright 2024 KLTV/KTRE. All rights reserved.",
