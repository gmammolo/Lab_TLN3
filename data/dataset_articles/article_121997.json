  "text": "ET Online | Oct 11, 2024, 04:41:53 PM IST 1 / 5 Northern lights illuminate UK skies once again The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, lit up the skies across the UK with stunning vibrant colours. Initially expected to be visible only as far south as the Midlands, this breathtaking display reached more regions, marking one of the strongest displays since May, according to BBC Weather. As solar activity winds down, there might still be a chance for those in northern areas to witness the phenomenon on Friday night.\niStock 2 / 5 How are the northern lights formed? The northern lights occur when high-energy particles from the sun collide with Earth's upper atmosphere. These particles, travelling at speeds of up to 72 million kph, are redirected toward the Earth's poles by the planet's magnetic field. This interaction produces a spectacular light show, as these particles cause the atmosphere to emit different colours, depending on the atmospheric gases involved.\niStock 3 / 5 The solar cycle and its impact on auroras The sun undergoes an 11-year cycle, fluctuating between periods of low and high solar activity. Auroras tend to be more vivid and frequent during periods of high solar activity, known as the solar maximum. As we approach the next solar maximum between 2024 and 2025, there are more opportunities for intense auroral displays.\niStock 4 / 5 Tips for viewing the northern lights For the best aurora viewing experience, it's crucial to be in the right location at the right time. The \"auroral zone,\" located around 1,550 miles from the North Pole, offers the highest chance of seeing the lights. Locations like Fairbanks (Alaska), Yellowknife (Canada), Tromsø (Norway), Abisko National Park (Sweden), Rovaniemi (Finland), and various sites in Iceland are ideal spots, and the best viewing time is between September and April, from 9pm to 3am. Always check local weather forecasts, as cloud cover can block visibility. You can also monitor aurora activity using forecasts from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and NOAA. While some recommend avoiding bright moonlit nights, strong auroras can still be visible, and the moonlight can even enhance the experience by lighting up the landscape.\niStock 5 / 5 Auroras beyond Earth Auroras are not exclusive to Earth. They have been observed on planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which have strong magnetic fields. Even Mars, despite its weaker magnetic field, exhibits different types of auroras. Observing auroras on other planets enhances our understanding of this stunning phenomenon and reveals its presence throughout our solar system.\niStock Read more on northern lights Northern Lights aurora borealis UK skies viewing tips breathtaking displays solar activity atmospheric phenomena photography tips best locations Popular Slideshows 9 Ayurvedic secrets to burn stubborn belly fat These 5 stocks' PE ratios are higher than industry PE Clove water: How to make this spray for stronger hair Gainers & Losers: Adani Ports among 6 stocks that hogged limelight today Zomato and 4 other stocks with very high PE ratio How to decide between trading and investing: Which is Better for You?
