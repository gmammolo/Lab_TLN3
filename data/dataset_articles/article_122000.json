People across the county have been awestruck by the swirling colours in the clear night sky last night (October 10).\nNorthern Lights, also called Aurora Borealis, are so breathtaking because they have magnificent colours of green, pink, violet, red and blue. Social media - and the KentLive mail box - are full of photos of the natural illuminations.\nPeople get so excited in this part of the world not only because of the sheer multi-coloured splendour of the skies, but because they are seen only occasionally over the country. According to the Met Office , Northern Lights happen because of \"solar activity and result from collisions of charged particles in the solar wind colliding with molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere\".\nThe reason we are seeing them, according to the Met Office, is because there had been “more space weather events in recent months”, including the Northern Lights, because the sun was nearing the peak of its solar cycle. And you might be looking over your fantastic photos rather than seeing it again tonight, as the Met Office says: \"The chances of aurora remain initially, though gradually easing through October 11, becoming increasingly confined to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.\"\nTake a look at readers' incredible photos of Thursday's Northern Lights display below.\nDarren Gregory sent us this lovely shot from Westbrook in Margate\n1 of 19 Share\nComments Terri Hawkes took this shot in Aylesham\n2 of 19 Share\nComments Dizzy Rowe's photo taken from Cliftonville\n3 of 19 Share\nComments Alex Henning captured the Northern Lights in Tunbridge Wells\n4 of 19 Share\nComments Danny Kennan captured this photo from Sheerness seafront\n5 of 19 Share\nComments Mira Yanusheva's shot from Maidstone\n6 of 19 Share\nComments Another of the impressive sight in Aylesham by Terri Hawkes\n(Image: Terri Hawkes) 7 of 19 Share\nComments Katie Gardner took this photo of the Northern Lights in Deal\n8 of 19 Share\nComments Another shot from Cliftonville by Dizzy Rowe\n9 of 19 Share\nComments And another of Dizzy Rowe's photos from Cliftonville\n10 of 19 Share\nComments Chloe Holmwood's view from Sheppey\n11 of 19 Share\nComments Lucy Williamson sent in this photo from Wingham, near Canterbury\n12 of 19 Share\nComments Hayley Blackstone captured this stunning shot from Herne Bay\n13 of 19 Share\nComments Sheerness seafront in Kenny Kennan's photo\n(Image: Kenny Kennan) 14 of 19 Share\nComments The Northern Lights in Appledore by Katrina Mercer\n15 of 19 Share\nComments Walk Tonbridge captured this shot at Tonbridge Castle\n16 of 19 Share\nComments Karen-Marie Brough sent us this lovely photo from Folkestone\n17 of 19 Share\nComments John Green took this shot in Southborough\n18 of 19 Share\nComments Herne Bay\n(Image: @natsaberry9) 19 of 19 Share\nComments More On IYA Alert County Best of Kent Good News",
