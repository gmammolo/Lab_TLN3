  "text": "If you didn't realise the Northern Lights were out in [full glow above the skies of Nottinghamshire last night](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/gallery/stunning-northern-lights-photos-capture-9622832) (Thursday, October 10), you might have been kicking yourself that you didn't witness the wonder. But there's no need to worry - as supposedly, they'll be back again tonight, Friday, October 11. Last night, the lights began to show up on photographs at around 9 or 9.30pm. Then, at 10pm, a red glow could be visible in the sky when facing north across the county - and it is likely to be similar tonight. The Met Office says [there's a chance the lights will be visible every day until October 13, Sunday.](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/good-news) As time goes on though, they'll gradually be less visible across the more southern parts of the UK and instead be confined to visibility across Scotland. The [weather](https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/weather) does affect things, too. A clear sky is needed to see the lights in full glory, and while last night was cloud-free, there's a threat of rain across Nottingham and surrounding areas tonight, meaning visibility could be hampered from around 11pm onwards. The British Geological Survey [explains that the northern lights - the aurora borealis - are the result of a geomagnetic storm,](http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/education/viewing_aurora) where the earth's magnetic field changes very quickly and strong electric currents flow high in the atmosphere. On average, the aurora can be seen in the far north of Scotland every few months, but less often as you travel south, the BGS says. But it's twice in the space of just a few months for the East Midlands now, with the phenomenon [stunning the county's population in May.](https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/northern-lights-delight-people-around-9278210) There have been rumours of them returning since, but Thursday, October 10, was the first time they were out in full force, less than half a year since the previous occasion. Historically, eager aurora hunters would travel to Scandinavia for the best view of the Lights. But it seems in more recent times that people need not leave the comfort of their own gardens to spot the sight.",
