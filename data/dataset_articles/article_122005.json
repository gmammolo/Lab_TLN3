The name “Wonderland” emerged in 1965, and the park eventually became complete with a 141-foot Giant Wheel, a castle full of rides and games, and much more.\n🏰 But the family-owned business has also faced tragedies including several fires and fatalities. In recent years, its financial challenges became so great that as of August, the park was “no longer a viable business,” as current operator and Ocean City Mayor Jay Gillian announced.\n🏰 Since the sad news broke, families have rushed to enjoy a few more spins on the carousel.
