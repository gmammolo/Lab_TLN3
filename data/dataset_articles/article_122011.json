  "text": "[UK News](https://thethaiger.com/world/uk/) Northern Lights spotted as far south as Essex Stunning aurora sightings across the UK, including Essex and Northern Ireland Photographs captured tonight show the Northern Lights as far south as Essex. The Met Office stated that parts of the UK had a “decent chance” of witnessing the aurora borealis. Sightings were expected to be most frequent in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with possible appearances in northern England and the Midlands. Images shared with the Mirror reveal stunning aurora displays from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. A photograph taken by Jon Gillespie showcases a vivid red across a clear sky. Other notable images show the phenomenon from Whitby in North Yorkshire and near Keswick in Cumbria. The Mirror has compiled a gallery of the best pictures taken tonight. The Met Office forecast relatively clear skies across much of the UK, enhancing the likelihood of visibility. A spokesman noted increased space weather events, including the Northern Lights, due to the sun nearing its solar cycle peak. The [#northernlights]were visible across much of the country last night, but they were also visible from space, as shown in this low light satellite image 👇With the [#aurora]showing up as a pale yellow ribbon of colour across northern latitudes[pic.twitter.com/42msqNrIjZ]— Met Office (@metoffice) [October 11, 2024] Stephen Dixon from the Met Office mentioned the possibility of visible auroras across parts of the UK from Thursday night into early Friday. He acknowledged “some uncertainty” about the exact timing of visibility. Dixon explained that aurora sightings were likely in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with potential sightings in northern England and the Midlands. He added that a camera with long exposure could capture auroras even further south. Clear skies over much of the UK, except for parts of western Scotland, increased the chance of visibility. Residual viewings could be possible over the weekend, mainly in Scotland. However, rain and cloud could obscure visibility, making Thursday night the primary focus for aurora sightings. Auroras, commonly seen over high polar latitudes but visible in parts of the UK during geomagnetic storms, are influenced by solar activity. The sun’s 11-year solar cycle, with peak sunspot activity known as solar maximum, leads to potential Earth-directed energy bursts called coronal mass ejections, which cause auroras. Dixon noted the sun is nearing the peak of its solar cycle, resulting in more recent space weather events. Prediction centres, including the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre, expect the solar maximum later this year or early next year. Even after the solar cycle peak, Northern Lights sightings in the UK remain possible. As the cycle progresses, space weather events will gradually decline but won’t cease entirely, allowing for future aurora sightings. Aurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere around the magnetic poles. These collisions emit light at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky. What Other Media Are Saying - inews highlights stunning pictures of Northern Lights illuminating UK skies, captured in Buckinghamshire, Kent, and London, showcasing a spectacular display of aurora borealis.
