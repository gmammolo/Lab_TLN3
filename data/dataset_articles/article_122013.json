  "text": "The fiery colors were there, on the night of Thursday October 10 to Friday October 11, in the Alpes-Maritimes and the [Var](/tag/Var). Spectacular northern lights could indeed be observed in the sky of our two departments, as scientists had announced a few days earlier. Many readers of [Nice](/tag/Nice)-Matin and Var-Matin sent us beautiful photos during the night, after admiring this rare and unique spectacle. From Nice Here, a photo sent by Cassandra from Fabron Hill, in Nice. You can even see a shooting star, the highlight of the show! Whether from Vence, Carros, [Grasse](/tag/Grasse), Gréolières or Lorgues, the Côte d’Azur Weather Facebook page – Livealso shared photos, each more spectacular than the last. But individuals were also able to have fun. Taken from Nice, this photo, sent by Ivar, is adorned with magnificent pink hues. Here a photo taken by Laurine from [Le Cannet](/tag/Le+Cannet). In the Var Same thing in the Var this fabulous night, where the sky was adorned with pink glow on the northern horizon, thanks to a solar storm which offered us its most beautiful hues. Here in Castellet, this photo, sent by Vincent, looks like a painting. The weather conditions were perfect for optimal observation. Thus, in places where light pollution was minimal, the lucky ones were able to see a sky tinted with purple and pink. At Luc, still in the Var, Dorian witnessed an incredible show, which he shared with us. Solar storms can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, a flow of plasma made up of charged particles, which takes up to a few days to reach Earth. For a crazy show. Their interaction with the Earth’s magnetic field produces the Northern Lights, similar to gigantic, undulating, colorful curtains of light.",
