  "text": "Sunshine and warmer 80s through the weekend First Alert Forecast HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ([WAFF](http://www.waff.com/)) - Good morning and happy Friday! Fair skies and comfortable temperatures in the 40s and 50s start off our day, a light layer may not be a bad idea when heading out the door to work and school. Today is going to be a fantastic end to the work and school week with a few clouds and highs in the upper 70s to low 80s, winds should be calm through the day. It looks like a great fall evening for high school football games with temperatures in the upper 60s by kickoff. Skies remain clear overnight with cool morning lows in the upper 40s to lower 50s by daybreak Saturday. Temperatures warm into the weekend with more sunshine, afternoon temps will reach the low to middle 80s with some upper 80s possible Sunday. Another Fall cold front will sweep through on Monday of next week dropping our high temperatures well below average into the middle 60s to lower 70s. Morning low temperatures through the week are trending colder in the upper 30s to middle 40s. We will need to keep a close eye on any potential frost developing in the sheltered areas and higher elevations Wednesday and Thursday morning. With the ongoing abnormally dry and drought conditions across the Tennessee Valley, drought conditions will likely worsen quickly with no beneficial rainfall in the forecast for at least the next ten days.
