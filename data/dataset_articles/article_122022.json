  "text": "We have another ideal weather week for fishing, so get out there and make the most of it! With cooler morning temperatures, the prime fishing hours will be during the most pleasant time of day, so you won’t need to head out too early or stay too late. Plus, the fall foliage has reached its peak in the high country and is expected to reach its peak in the coming weeks throughout the valley, offering stunning views to complement some fantastic fall fishing.\nSilver Creek—With the Creek now fully in fall mode, you can expect to see primarily Baetis, along with a few Mahogany duns, October caddis and midge hatching during the most pleasant time of day. The best surface feeding occurs in a brief window from mid to late afternoon. Hatches can vary from sporadic to prolific, depending on the weather and your location on the Creek. As always, when hunting surface feeders, use a long leader down to 6x and be sure to make perfect, drag-free presentations. If the wind picks up, adjust your strategy: Shorten your leader, use stouter tippet and try terrestrials. Nymphs and streamers remain effective options as well.\nThe Wood—October is an excellent time to fish the Wood. The cottonwoods are changing color and there are plenty of beautiful wild trout eager to take a fly. Insects have been most active between noon until the sun leaves the water. Look for fish in the tailouts, along the seams of fast water and in the slower, gently flowing sections. During peak hours, focus on surface feeders using a long leader paired with a small baetis or caddis pattern. If there are no risers, try covering the water with a Hecuba (Red Quill) and a small nymph trailing behind. Euro-style nymphing is also effective this time of year to help turn quick takes into hookups.",
