From Belfast to Ballymoney and Carrickfergus to Ballynure, your pictures of the aurora borealis were breath-taking. Hues of green, blue, pink and purple danced across the sky during the eye-catching phenomenon, which is caused by solar activity that can cause charged particles in solar winds to smash into molecules in the Earth's atmosphere sparking the colourful displays.

Almost anyone armed with a smartphone or digital camera can take a picture of auroras in the skies. Experts advise checking the best spots to capture them and whether there will be cloud cover. And your pictures from Thursday night's display did not disappoint. Take a look here: For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.",
