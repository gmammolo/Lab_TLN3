Get ready to pull out your cameras: There's a geomagnetic storm underway, and it could produce the northern lights across the country.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) has called for a major geomagnetic storm that was anticipated to hit Earth Thursday and into Friday, and it's already begun.\nA geomagnetic storm is a disturbance of the Earth's magnetic field, typically triggered by solar activity on the sun.\nOn a scale of G1 to G5, the SWPC predicted a G4, which was reached earlier Thursday afternoon. For comparison, the geomagnetic storm that occurred on May 10-11 was a G5.\nBut the caveat, as always, is that the northern lights are difficult to predict.\nThe northern lights are seen over Harrowsmith, Ont., on the night of Oct. 8. (Malcolm Park)\nFor example, last week the SPWC had forecast a G3 storm for the weekend after two powerful solar flares erupted from the sun, followed by a coronal mass ejection, which sends particles from the sun on a fast wind towards Earth. If these particles interact with our magnetic field, we get the northern lights.\nInitially, however, it looked like it was a miss. A few days later, though, the northern lights could be seen as far south as South Dakota and other parts of the…\nNicole Mortillaro",
