  "text": "The “ storm of the century ” became “ not the worst case scenario ”, and Florida residents have wind shear to thank. Milton was a Category 5 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico, but was weakened by changes in wind speed and direction before it hit land and turned the sky purple.\nThe sting in the tail is that the disruption of a hurricane can spout tornadoes, dozens of which were reported across the state. One on the east coast killed at least four people in a senior living community.\nMillions of evacuated Floridians will now return home to assess the damage and hope their insurers pay out. “Lieutenant Dan”, a man in Tampa who went viral online after promising to ride out the hurricane in a 20ft boat, won’t have any problems as he survived with his vessel intact.\nDue to a last-minute wobble, Milton made landfall 70 miles south.\naLSO, in the sensemaker Nobels show cutting edge science going private\nEtonian named as middleman for Russia’s ‘ghost fleet’\nCern at 70 has given us answers – and questions\nAccusations mount against Harrod boss Al Fayed\nJoe Root: England cricket’s record-breaking Test run-scorer’s career by the numbers",
