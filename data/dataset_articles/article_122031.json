People across Devon were treated to an amazing display of the lights last night with vibrant shades of pink, purple, blue, and green illuminating the sky.\nAlthough the likelihood of seeing the aurora is lower today, the Met Office said there is a chance for people to get a glimpse. The Exeter-based forecaster posted a map on X which shows where and when is best to see the stunning natural phenomenon.\nAccording to the Met Office, Scotland gives the best chance of seeing the Northern Lights tonight. The best time will be at around 10pm.\nThe Met Office said in a post on X: \"Cloudier skies tonight will limit the chances of seeing the #northernlights , however Scotland offers the best chance of seeing the Aurora.\"\nThe Northern Light are caused by activity on the surface of the sun. It is usually only visible in the poles but Met Office forecasters revealed the phenomenon could be seen last night due to a severe solar storm.\nThe forecaster said there have been \"more space weather events in recent months\", including the Northern Lights. This is because the sun is nearing the peak of its solar cycle.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
