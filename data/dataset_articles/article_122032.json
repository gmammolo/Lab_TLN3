  "text": "Atmospheric conditions mean the aurora was visible on Thursday Gloucestershire Live readers have sent in their beautiful pictures of the northern lights as the aurora was visible in the county's skies on Thursday night (October 10). The Met Office issued a warning saying the phenomenon might be visible and how right they were despite it being usually more visible in the north of the UK. The south of the country has seen its fair share and according to the Met Office website: \"The northern lights (also known as aurora borealis) appear as large areas of colour including pale green, pink, shades of red, yellow, blue and violet in the direction due north. \"The northern lights are best seen in darkness, away from any light pollution. The lights generally extend from 50 miles to as high as 400 miles above the Earth's surface. The northern lights occur as a consequence of solar activity and result from collisions of charged particles in the solar wind colliding with molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere.\" Zoe Dykes from Alderton near Tewkesbury captured some amazing images of the northern lights, describing the view as \"humbling and exhilarating.\" \"It feels like watching the sky come alive with a dance of colours, Zoe said. \"There’s a quiet awe that settles over you, almost like time stops for a moment as the lights ripple above and it's a humbling and exhilarating reminder of how incredible our world is.\" Jo Findlay from Tetbury, who was lucky enough to witness the aurora borealis earlier in May too, said \"it feels amazing\" seeing them again. Some of the best images sent to us are below.
