  "text": "Hello hello and say hey to Friday Faves.\nI don’t know of anyone who doesn’t agree that our hearts go out to those affected by the onslaught of hurricanes and tornados last week and yet again this week. It’s absolutely devastating with support and donations needed for so many.\nThis week I sent my email subscribers a list of some of my favorite pumpkin recipes like these Pumpkin Cookies that are DIVINE. If you aren’t a subscriber yet, sign up here to get recipe ideas sent to you, ad-free and for free.\nI just watched this heartfelt and important documentary and it was really so moving. It’s such a beautiful depiction of friendship and unconditional love.\nThe best books so far this year . What have you read and loved lately?\n6 teachers on what their jobs are really like . I have the utmost respect for teachers. My mom was a teacher for over 40 years. I think it’s one of the most challenging and important professions and we should all feel indebted with gratitude.\nLoved this interview with Gwyneth who has become many follower’s health and mindfulness guru. And in case you’ve never made these blueberry muffins of hers, take this as your cue, because they are the BEST blueberry muffins I’ve ever made.\nThis video of Italian nonnas identifying types of bread merely on the sound it makes when broken is too good. I’m impressed!\nSpeaking of delicious Italian carbs… this almond ricotta cake looks impossibly moist and fluffy and I really wish I had a slice of it right now…\nMy husband is always experimenting so I know he’s going to want to take a look at the best way to cook steaks at home (according to professional chefs).\nButternut squash fries with hot honey –can’t get my Air Fryer out fast enough!\nMexican food is fall food and these chicken enchiladas are in need of making.\nHomemade apple cider just can’t be beat.\nThese beefy noodles look so slurpable.\nThis egg dish is one of my favorites to order when we’re out for breakfast or brunch. I haven’t tried making it at home yet, but this recipe looks legit.\nThis pasta salad has some of my favorite fall ingredients.\nHow fantastic does this luxuriously creamy coconut lime chicken look?\nThis soup is SO up my alley.\nAnd, this one is an all-time favorite of mine.\nA catch-all, one-pan, garlicky chicken dinner that packs a punch.\nThis sweet potato honey bun cake looks so dreamy.\nWhat a spectacular home tour . That big stained glass window! The marble soaking tub! That cozy back porch setup! All the heart eyes over this one.\nLove this sweater skirt ( in this season’s hottest color ).\nThe cuffs and sleeves on this oh-so-comfy sweater will likely be making their way to my closet because it is totally one I would live in all winter.\nI’m not a Tik Tok follower, but word is, that this viral trend actually works.\nI’ve been looking for some new fall makeup and just picked up this matte lip balm in the most gorgeous rose color. Lipsticks are generally too much for me, so I like that this is an easy, buildable color and it’s smooth too. Highly recommend.\nAlso, I finally bought this buzzy product that everyone seems to love and I’m excited to see if it lives up to the hype. Stay tuned…\nOn the hunt for the best water bottle? Here are 8 you might consider . This one’s my fave and always gets me to drink more water. The soft, flexible straw is the best!\nThe best advent calendars to buy this year (nope, it’s actually not too early).\nThat’s it for this week. Have a fantastic weekend and cook something good!\nWe send good emails. Subscribe to FoodieCrush and have each post plus exclusive content only for our subscribers delivered straight to your e-mail box.\nFollow me on Instagram , Facebook, Pinterest , and Twitter for more FoodieCrush inspiration.\nAs always, thank you for reading and supporting companies I partner with, which allows me to create more unique content and recipes for you.
