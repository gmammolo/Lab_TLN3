  "text": "PORTLAND (WGME)--- A gorgeous end to the week and start of the weekend is expected in Maine, before rain arrives later into the weekend. Friday will be nice and sunny. Highs will be in the low 60s for the afternoon. Saturday will be quite similar, but also much windier. We'll see lots of sun with highs in the low 60s once again. More clouds are in store for Sunday, and some rain showers will be possible by the late afternoon and into the evening. Temps will be in the 50s. Rain becomes steadier into Sunday night, and it likely sticks around through Monday morning, and may persist into the afternoon as well. Highs will again be in the 50s. A few showers likely linger on Tuesday, especially up in the mountains. As temps will be quite cool, high elevations will likelypick up some more snow. Highswill be in the lower 50s. Temps will be quite chilly for Tuesday and Wednesday nights next week. Lows will dip to near or below the freezing mark both nights, likely bringing the growing season to an end in many locations. A few rain and mountain snow showers will also persist into Wednesday. Several inches of snow will be possible in the highest elevations. Highs will be in the upper 40s or low 50s. We continue to slowly clear out into Thursday. Highs will be in the 50s.",
