  "text": "Halls Chapel Baptist Church showed signs of life despite destruction BURNSVILLE, N.C. (WBTV) - With much of western North Carolina still recovering from Helene, a powerful photo has gone semi-viral after a church was damaged in Yancey County. Like many other communities in the mountains, Yancey County was hit hard when Helene passed through on Friday, Sept. 27. The county has reported the second-most deaths in North Carolina with 11. Only Buncombe County, where Asheville is, has more. Yancey County was wrought with devastation, leaving homes and properties destroyed. Halls Chapel Baptist Church , located along the South Toe River in Burnsville, was not immune to the damage. The tiny, white-siding church was formerly part of a picturesque scene, nestled at the bottom of a hill with tall trees behind it and the river running in front of it. After Helene, though, the building was left in pieces. Photos of the church show major damage. The front awning was ripped off during the storm, and at least three walls were essentially blown out, leaving gaping holes behind. Despite the severe damage, the church presented signs of life and resiliency. A makeshift sign, made out of what looks like a bedsheet, read “SERVICE 11 AM SUNDAY.” A flag still hung from the front railing, and the steeple still stood high in the mountain air. So, perhaps, in some ways it still is picturesque. Pictures of the church were shared on Facebook by a woman whose fiancé and son took a helicopter to deliver a generator and other supplies to the area. In her post, the woman wrote, “You can wash away their belongings, destroy their homes, lose all security and access to transportation or food. Folks...you can’t take away your faith and spirituality.” The viral photo has been shared more than 10,000 times since it was posted on Oct. 4, with many commenters focusing on the resiliency the picture shows. Other photos were posted later. “Incredible devastation! But incredible strength!” one person commented. “At that service I bet they will be thankful!” another comment read. “After all that they have been through. A good reminder that no matter how bad it gets there is always something to be thankful for.” Others called the church’s resiliency “a touching moment,” and many offered their prayers and condolences. “This is the time when people need to gather together to praise God and support each other,” one commenter wrote. “I imagine there will be many people there come Sunday morning.” “The devil sent a storm to destroy their church and faith,” the original author said in a separate post . “It certainly didn’t touch their faith.” The woman said she has asked her fiancé to take her to the tiny, white-siding church when it is rebuilt. A fund has been set up to help with the rebuilding efforts. As of Friday morning, nearly $3,000 had been raised. Those wishing to give toward the rebuild can do so here .
