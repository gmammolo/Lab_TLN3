  "text": "(This story has been updated to add a photo gallery .) The northern lights were visible on Cape Cod Thursday night. The spectacular light show , usually seen only much closer to the Earth's poles, was visible last night thanks to a geomagnetic storm , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center . The storm, which is when an eruption of solar material and magnetic fields arrives at Earth, was expected to make the famous aurora visible to the northern half of the country . Cape Cod Times photographer Steve Heaslip caught an image of the lights over Barnstable Harbor , proving that the storm extended the phenomena to the Cape. \"Watches at this level are very rare,\" NOAA said. Officials didn't have an exact prediction yesterday for when the lights would be visible. NOAA has a spacecraft one million miles away from Earth that can detect when a solar storm is headed over the planet. When it is detected by the spacecraft, the auroras are expected to be seen over Earth within 15-30 minutes. The organization has a webpage dedicated to a 30-minute forecast of the aurora .
