  "text": "TODAY:\n82° & SUNNY\nAfter a cool/mild start to the day, things will be warming up nicely into the afternoon due to southerly winds.\nWithout cloud cover once the sun warms things up it'll feel a bit toasty but not too bad especially if you can find some shade.\nBut a beautiful evening tonight. Post sunset Fall-Fest conditions will be the warmest they've been so far so not needing to worry about layering up too much.\nBut a beautiful evening tonight. Post sunset Fall-Fest conditions will be the warmest they've been so far so not needing to worry about layering up too much.\nClear conditions so if we have the chance to see the aurora borealis again we'll at least see great viewing conditions. If we don't, at least a great opportunity to stargaze.\nTOMORROW:\n86° & SUNNY\nOur Saturday will be perfect for Fall Fest's last day. It'll be dry and some clouds will actually filter in and out helping the sun to not feel like it's beating down quite as much. Just be prepared for a hot day regardless of the clouds providing some shade. Only a few degrees from the 90s. At least no humidity.\nSUNDAY:\n54° / 82° & SUNNY\nSlightly cooler for our Sunday with temperatures not as hot with temperatures in the low 80s.\nNo chance for rain but a cold front will bring noticeably cooler conditions for our Sunday evening and overnight.\nNEXT WEEK:\n40s→30s / 60s & SUNNY\nAfter the passage of that Sunday cold front, things will be much cooler for our Monday and rest of week.\nOur high temperatures most of next week will be in the 60s! We may even see our first frosty lows with lows in the 30s.\nOur high temperatures most of next week will be in the 60s! We may even see our first frosty lows with lows in the 30s.",
