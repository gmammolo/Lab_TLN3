Elsa Arismendi Photo Advertisement Expand Listen to this article 00:01:12 The highly anticipated light show Thursday night did not disappoint.\nThe skies over Orillia — and around the globe — were alight with a spectacular northern lights display last night. Experts say the northern lights may again be visible Friday and possibly even Saturday thanks to some solar activity this week.\nThursday night's light show adds to the many major aurora borealis displays seen this year, all due to the sun’s magnetic field, which is at the peak of its 11-year cycle and putting out more solar storms, resulting in more frequent and strong displays of the northern lights.\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center continues to project that by the time the geomagnetic storm reaches Canada, we could reach G4 (severe) storm levels, and it has even mentioned a G5 (extreme) storm isn’t out of the question.\nA G5 storm is the same strength of storm that we saw May 10 and 11, resulting in an almost 13-hour display of the northern lights.\nDid you capture a good photo of last night's northern lights? If so email it to [email protected] and we'll add it to our photo gallery.\nTags: Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add If you would like to apply to become a verified commenter, please fill out this form .",
