  "text": "Advertisement Photos: Northern lights dazzle in skies over in New England The northern lights put on a vibrant show over New England on Thursday night. The dancing pink and green hues — visible even for many in light-polluted areas like Boston — were [caused by a solar flare](https://www.wbur.org/npr/g-s1-27384/solar-storm-power-grids-hurricanes) that erupted earlier this week. The sun has reached a period in its [11-year cycle](https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/10/04/northern-lights-new-england-massachusetts-boston-october-solar-cycle-25-newsletter) when it is most active, causing the northern lights to be more visible over New England recently. ([Here's more](https://x.com/NWSLaCrosse/status/1844511893135950110) on the science of auroras.) If you missed the display, or want to relive the magic, you may have another shot. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.spaceweather.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) shows there's a chance that the aurora will be visible in New England again Friday and Saturday night. Here's a look at the bright sights from last night:",
