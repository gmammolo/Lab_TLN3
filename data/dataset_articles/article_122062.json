Updated: 6:10 AM MDT Oct 11, 2024 FIESTA PARK WITH 530 JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WE ARE STARTING TO GET INTO THAT TIME OF MORNING WHERE THE CROWD JUST REALLY SWELLS HERE. YOU GOT THAT BUZZ OF EXCITEMENT AND YOU KNOW, THE DRONE SHOWS JUST ABOUT 20 MINUTES AWAY. THE PILOT BRIEFING SHORTLY AFTER THAT. THEN DAWN PATROL GOES UP. IT’S ABOUT TO GO DOWN HERE. AND I THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER REAL GOOD MORNING SO FAR. WE ARE SIX FOR SIX HERE AT FIESTA AND TODAY IS LIKELY GOING TO MAKE IT SEVEN FOR SEVEN. THE FORECAST HERE AT BALLOON FIESTA PARK GOT THAT EARLY MORNING NUMBER RIGHT AROUND 50 DEGREES FOR A FEW HOURS. I DO NEED TO DRESS FOR THE CHILL TO KIND OF SETTLE INTO YOUR BODY A LITTLE BIT. IF YOU’RE GOING TO COME ON DOWN, BUT I THINK THE WINDS WILL BE FRIENDLY FOR FLYING LESS THAN THAT 7 OR 8 MILE PER HOUR THRESHOLD. NOW THIS EVENING, SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY, IT JUST LOOKS QUIET AND QUITE DELIGHTFUL, TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY DROPPING DOWN THROUGH THE 70S. PROBABLY FINE TO BE IN SHORT SLEEVES HERE AT BALLOON FIESTA PARK. IT’S NOT OFTEN WE SAY THAT IN OCTOBER, RIGHT? HERE’S A LOOK AT FORECAST CONDITIONS AROUND THE REST OF THE STATE FOR THE AFTERNOON. WE EXPECT 70, 80 AND 90 DEGREE HIGHS. OBVIOUSLY WARMER THE FURTHER YOU HEAD SOUTH THESE NUMBERS CLOSE TO RECORD VALUES JUST A LITTLE PATCHY. CLOUD COVER DRIFTS IN FROM THE NORTH AND WEST. LOWS TONIGHT 40S AND 50S WITH A CLEAR OR MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. SATURDAY AFTER ANOTHER PROBABLY FRIENDLY MORNING FOR FLYING THE AFTERNOON HAS A CHALLENGING RECORD HIGHS AGAIN WITH DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. LITTLE CHANGE SUNDAY SUNDAY MORNING OF COURSE, WE WRAP UP FIESTA AND I THINK WE’LL GET THE BALLOONS IN THE AIR. ONE FINAL TIME. THERE’S A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT WE GO NINE FOR NINE IN THIS YEAR’S FIESTA, AND SUNDAY WE’RE BACK UP NEAR RECORD HIGHS AGAIN ACROSS THE STATE. HERE IS YOUR FORECAST ACROSS NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AREA. WE EVENTUALLY ARE IN FOR A TEMPERATURE DROP, BUT TODAY IT’S LOWER 80S AND WE KEEP IT IN THE LOWER 80S INTO THE WEEKEND. AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEKEND, DROP THE NUMBERS SLIGHTLY. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE MONDAY, MAYBE WEDNESDAY WHERE WE COULD HAVE A COUPLE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE AREA. HERE’S A LOOK RIGHT NOW AT SOUTHWEST NEW MEXICO. NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT A SLIGHT CHANCE AT RAIN. WE’RE BRIGHT. WE ARE WARM. WE’VE GOT 80S AND 90S OFF THE MOUNTAINS AND WE KEEP IT WAY WARM INTO AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND ONLY SLIGHTLY DROP THE NUMBERS NEXT WEEK. NOW THE COOLDOWN IS GOING TO BE MORE DRAMATIC IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE. THIS IS SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO, AND WE ARE WELL INTO THE 90S TODAY, TOMORROW, AND SATURDAY WE ARE CHALLENGING RECORD HIGHS. BEFORE WE DO DROP THE NUMBERS INTO NEXT WEEK. BUT EVEN AT THAT DROP IN THE NUMBERS NEXT WEEK, WE CONTINUE TO STAY ABOVE AVERAGE IN NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO. WHAT A WEATHER FRIENDLY DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES REAL CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES IN LAS VEGAS. AND YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A COOLDOWN COMING NEXT WEEK. NOTHING TOO STRONG OR SEVERE. AND YOU KNOW, RAIN CHANCES REALLY DON’T LOOK THAT GREAT WITH THE COOLDOWN. UNFORTUNATELY, UP AROUND NORTH CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, IT’S HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S OR EVEN 80S IN THE ESPANOLA VALLEY, RUNNING WAY WARM FOR THE TIME OF YEAR AND WE’LL KEEP THOSE HIGHS IN SANTA FE UP AROUND 80 UNTIL MAYBE SUNDAY OR MONDAY, WHEN WE DROP OFF A LITTLE BIT NEXT WEEK. NOT EYEING UP MUCH OF A RAIN CHANCE. SO WITH THAT COOL DOWN AND YOU KNOW, FOR THE ALBUQUERQUE METRO, THIS WILL BE THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW WITH A FORECAST HIGH TEMPERATURE AT 86 AT THE SUNPORT UPPER 80S TO THE RIVER VALLEY. RECORD HIGHS 88. AND THAT’S JUST OUT OF REACH FROM BEING TIED. YESTERDAY. WE DID TIE THE RECORD AT 86. NOW ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WE ARE WITHIN LIKE 1 OR 2 OF THOSE RECORD HIGHS. SO IT CONTINUES TO STAY VERY WARM. NOW THE COOLDOWN COMING NEXT WEEK. NOT AS POWERFUL AS WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. WE DO EVENTUALLY TRIM THOSE HIGHS INTO THE VERY UPPER 70S, BUT THAT’S STILL ALMOST TEN DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE AND SO NO END IN SIGHT TO THIS WARM RUN OF TEMPERATURES AND ALSO, SADLY, NO END IN SIGHT TO THIS DRY RUN OF DAYS.
