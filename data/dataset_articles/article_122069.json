  "text": "We’ve seen some absolutely stunning photos in 2024 of the northern lights — AKA Aurora Borealis — but that was back in May.\nSo why did we see them again in some places you wouldn’t expect in October that produced more amazing photographs in the United States and England? Good question!\nPer USA TODAY : It’s “thanks to the “severe” geomagnetic storm forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A coronal mass ejection of plasma clouds and charged particles driving the storm prompted NOAA’s Space Prediction Center to issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch for the second time this year .”\nHere’s a look at those amazing photos:\n1\nAurora borealis, or northern lights, produced by a solar geomagnetic storm are seen over Washington, DC on October 10, 2024. Severe geomagnetic storm conditions could hamper ongoing recovery efforts for Hurricanes Helene and Milton by disrupting satellite communications, power grids and GPS services, the US Space Weather Prediction Center warned October 10, 2024. A coronal mass ejection (CME) struck Earth this morning at 11:17 am (1517 GMT), disrupting the Earth’s magnetic field and quickly achieving G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm conditions at 12:57 pm, the agency said.
