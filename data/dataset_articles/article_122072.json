  "text": "TYLER, Texas — As we get closer to the peak of our sun's [11-year solar cycle](/article/weather/texas-northern-lights/285-3f507e57-4884-41d2-8072-7edac00ff46f), solar flares, sun spots, prominences and coronal mass ejections become more likely. It's these coronal mass ejections (CME) that are famous for causing the [Aurora Borealis](/video/news/local/northern-lights-shine-over-texas-panhandle/285-4d1b5c62-6604-49cc-9225-bfb68e4b7b99) to erupt in the sky across our northern latitudes. Just a few days ago, on Oct. 8, our sun produced one of those CMEs -- a big one! This severe solar storm sent a cloud of plasma and charged particles racing directly toward our Earth. NOAA defines this one as a G4-level storm. That's only one level away from the most severe level of G5. The storm arrived Oct. 10, and will last through the first part of the weekend. It's the kind of geomagnetic storm that can do damage to communication satellites, GPS devices and other electronic infrastructure but also produce a tremendous display of the [Northern Lights](/video/news/local/northern-lights-shine-over-texas-panhandle/285-4d1b5c62-6604-49cc-9225-bfb68e4b7b99).
