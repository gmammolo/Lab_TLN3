  "text": "PANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - Good Friday morning everyone! It’s a quiet start on satellite and radar with clear skies and plenty of sunshine on the way today. However, it’s cooler out the door! Most will get the early morning commute before 8am underway in the 50s. You may want to reach for a light jacket to start the day. Make sure it’s something you can shed by lunch as temperatures still warm up pleasantly by the midday and afternoon. Highs today warm into the upper 70s near 80 degrees for a beautiful afternoon. Average highs for Mid-October are closer to the low 80s. So, we’re running slightly below average today. Keep the jacket handy if you’ve got Friday dinner or evening plans as we’ll get cooler quicker tonight. Temperatures slip into the 60s after dinner and we’ll continue to cool all the way back down into the 50s by Saturday morning. Sunday morning returns to the 50s as well! Yet, our weekend is full of blue sky and sunshine. That helps warm are midday and afternoons to the seasonal low 80s. Columbus day is on Monday. We’ll see a slight peak in temperatures returning to the mid 80s in the afternoon. But a bigger cool down is on the way for mid-week next week where highs by next Wednesday may only reach the mid 70s. Copyright 2024 WJHG. All rights reserved.",
