  "text": "Never Stop Driving #118: Community Standards I’m thinking about the folks in Florida and the Southeast this week as they begin to recover from Hurricane Milton. At times like these, our special cars are not the priority, yet of course Hagerty is here to help. Several team members are also volunteering in the Asheville cleanup effort from Hurricane Helene, and the Hagerty claims department is on call seven days a week at 800-385-0274 or claims@hagerty.com. Hagerty monitors the storms to anticipate needs and help owners protect their cars along with the rest of their property. Last weekend, I watched videos from helicopter pilots who flew in supplies to residents stranded after Hurricane Helene, including this one from the [feed of former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle.](https://www.instagram.com/gbiffle/reels/?hl=en) Many of the affected communities in western North Carolina are in steep, inaccessible valleys that can only be seen from the air, since the roads are washed away. Biffle’s videos showed just how bad the damage was. Local news crews, which once would have supplied this information in spades, often no longer have the budgets to cover such disasters, so we’re left with social media platforms. Biffle’s videos were terrific, so I was shocked by some of the petty, downright mean viewer comments. People accused some of the other volunteers of being grandstanders for also posting videos about their rescue efforts. Viewer comments on websites, YouTube, and other digital platforms are a longtime thorn in the side of content producers. You want to build an engaged online community with free-flowing conversations and insights, but there are always people who will say things through a keyboard that they wouldn’t dare say face to face. We call them “trolls” and the rule of thumb about negative and abusive comments is “don’t feed the trolls.” It can be a minefield for editors, which is why a lot of newspapers have ceased publishing comments altogether. Through Biffle, I found [videos from Garrett Mitchell,](https://www.youtube.com/@CleetusM/videos) an automotive YouTuber I’ve long admired who is known by his stage name “Cleetus McFarland.” Hagerty Media contributing writer Sam Smith calls him, with great admiration, a carnival barker. Mitchell, who also has a helicopter, flew supplies to stranded people and transported those who needed to get out. Being a YouTuber well versed in the mechanics of videography, Mitchell documented everything, including the often-harrowing landings. I’ve never met Mitchell, but he’s a hustler, showman, and innovator in the best possible way. There is no idea that’s too stupid or ambitious for him to try. Sure, he’s playing for his massive audience, but I like his core philosophy. If an idea is decent, I often tell my kids, why wouldn’t we at least try it? Action beats talk, right? Mitchell also proves you don’t need perfect or expensive cars to have all sorts of fun on wheels, as Smith recalled after attending [a McFarland event.](https://www.hagerty.com/media/opinion/smithology/smithology-the-cleetus-mcfactor/) Speaking of actions beating talk, my car buddies have long groused that they’d like to get out and drive more. I wholeheartedly agree, so a few years ago, I organized a three-day rally which has become an annual tradition, in different locations. I plan [the routes](https://www.hagerty.com/media/magazine-features/hagerty-magazine/ohio-colonial-rufus-putnam-had-no-idea-his-town-would-become-a-beachhead-in-driving-paradise/), the overnight stops, and the food, setting the scene for a relaxing few days to share our passion. It’s super fun and I encourage you to do the same. Someone has to be the organizer so it might as well be you. We’re better versions of ourselves when we’re physically together so as much as I appreciate you reading this digital article, I’m also encouraging you to close the laptop, pull the car out of the garage, and get out and mingle.
