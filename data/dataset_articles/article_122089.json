A fantastic display of northern lights captivated Granite Staters in all corners of the state Thursday night. “It's stunning. It’s the first time I've ever seen them, and I don't think I'll ever forget it,\" Katie DeSisto said. >> Amazing timelapse video: [See northern lights, shooting star from Deerfield](http://www.wmur.com/article/deerfield-new-hampshire-northern-lights-timelapse/62579336) The lights were seen from Manchester to the Seacoast and up through the Great North Woods. \"I called everybody out, like, ‘Come out,’ like, ‘Come take a look.’ I've never seen anything like it before. It's crazy,” Camden Johnson said. The jaw-dropping colors, which were slightly visible to the naked eye, came alive through camera lenses. \"I mean, they came out amazing on camera. I didn't think I was going to be able to capture them, but they came out really well,\" Johnson said. The aurora was supercharged by a solar storm more than 90 million miles away from Earth. >> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: [Apple](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=109350X1567034&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fwmur-news-9-breaking-news%2Fid504646663%3Fign-mpt%3Duo%253D6&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wmur.com%2Farticle%2Fnorthern-lights-new-hampshire-101124%2F62578509&xcust=undefined) | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hearst.android.wmur&hl=en) << An X-class flare earlier this week launched a coronal mass ejection from the sun, which hit the Earth on Thursday. The geomagnetic storm triggered by the CME fluctuated from a moderate G2 to a severe G4. Auroras were observed across Europe and North America. “I think I'm still like processing it because it was so cool, and I went back out to look, and I was like, aw, it's kind of over now,\" DeSisto said. “It was an amazing experience. Very cool stuff,” Johnson said. [There is a small chance](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) we could see more again Friday night, though it likely won’t be as vibrant or widespread. On nights when atmospheric conditions are right for the northern lights, like they were on Thursday, the best time to try to catch a glimpse is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., though the northern lights were visible as early as shortly after sunset Thursday. For the best view, head to an area away from city lights, find an open space, and look north, low on the horizon. Your cellphone camera can help, as it picks up more light than your eyes. The camera app might show some colors in the sky that you can't see without it. While the northern lights can be seen by the naked eye, visibility depends on factors such as weather, aurora strength and your location. Using a slow shutter speed on your camera will allow for a better view. If your camera shows the greens or reds that are typical of the northern lights, snap a quick picture and then put your phone away to let your eyes adjust to the darkness while you attempt some naked-eye viewing. If you spot the northern lights, send your photos to the [u local New Hampshire Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/696353974089910). What causes the colors of the aurora? The colors of the northern lights can range from blue to red to green to purple, with a few less common colors mixed in. The colors indicate both the altitude of the aurora and the atmospheric gases that are affected. If the aurora is weak or the skies aren't perfectly dark, it can be difficult to see the colors sometimes because of the way our eyes work. In dark environments, light-sensitive rods in our eyes are more active, but they don't perceive color, so the aurora might look gray. If it intensifies, the colors will brighten, activating the cones in our eyes and letting us make out the different colors. Green: The most common color seen is green, which is produced when charged particles collide with atomic oxygen at about 150 miles up. Green is also the easiest color for humans to perceive, so it's likely the color you'll see first. Red: Oxygen is also linked to red auroras, but at higher altitudes than green, at about 180 to 250 miles up. The oxygen at that altitude is less concentrated, and the charged particles excite it a higher frequency, causing the red color. Purple: Less common than green or red are purple auroras. This color is caused by ionized molecular nitrogen at lower altitudes above 60 miles up. Blue: Blue auroras can be difficult to see in a dark sky. This color is also caused by molecular nitrogen, this time at altitudes up to 60 miles. Yellow and pink: Other colors, like yellow and pink, can sometimes be seen, as well. These are caused by a mixing of other colors and are associated with high solar activity. >> Watch a timelapse video of the northern lights from Deerfield:",
