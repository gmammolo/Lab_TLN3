  "text": "Missed the northern lights in Bucks County? You might get another chance Friday The Earth's magnetic field graced Bucks County with vivid aurora borealis Thursday night after the sun let off a coronal mass ejection Tuesday. The ensuing geomagnetic storm was stronger than normal, [allowing](https://www.wgal.com/article/northern-lights-when-you-can-see-them/46073862) the northern lights to be seen further south. Northern lights possible in Bucks County on Friday There's a chance we'll see aurora borealis again Friday night, but it would likely be much dimmer, said Patrick O'Hara of the National Weather Service in Mount Holly. When it comes to solar activity, O'Hara said, the forecast can change within six hours. Meteorologist Karen Rogers [told](https://6abc.com/post/northern-lights-visible-philadelphia-pennsylvania-new-jersey-delaware-due-unusually-strong-geomagnetic-storm/15414568/) 6ABC that while the auroral activity index was at 8.5 out of 9 on Thursday night, it will only be at 5 on Friday night. For the best chance at seeing the geomagnetic storm, head for a darker area with less light pollution, and aim to find a clear view of the horizon. \"We don't think it'll happen tonight,\" O'Hara said. \"But the sun might have other ideas.\" Reporter Jess Rohan can be reached at jrohan@gannett.com.",
