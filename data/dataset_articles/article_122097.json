  "text": "Northern lights put on dazzling display in Maine, which could see aurora borealis again very soon Maine residents were treated to a breathtaking display of northern lights Thursday night, with vibrant colors filling the skies across the state. The event was triggered by a rare and severe geomagnetic storm, which was the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) of plasma from the sun. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center, the burst of energy came off of the sun Tuesday, raced toward Earth and arrived in the atmosphere on Thursday. Experts say the northern lights occur when solar particles collide with oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere, causing the air to glow. The different colors appear at varying altitudes, with green auroras typically occurring about 150 miles above the surface and pink hues forming around 60 miles up. Reactions from atomized oxygen particles create the green colors, while reactions from ionized molecular nitrogen create the blue and purple colors at lower altitudes. Thursday night's aurora borealis was visible across much of the northern half of the United States and as far south as Alabama in the East to northern California in the West. Mainers could be treated to another aurora very soon, as forecasters predict another northern lights show may happen Friday. Go through the photo gallery below to see even more photos of the northern lights in Maine from Thursday night.",
