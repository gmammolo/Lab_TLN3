  "text": "Tom Cruise can breathe a sigh of relief after his luxury Clearwater, Florida, penthouse stood tall against the potentially devastating Hurricane Milton. The mega-storm, which meteorologists initially warned could reach a catastrophic Category 5, ended up sparing Cruise’s prized multimillion-dollar property. The hurricane had been predicted to wreak havoc on the city, raising fears of a deadly storm surge and intense flooding. But according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the storm weakened just before landfall, easing concerns. “The storm was significant, but thankfully this was not the worst-case scenario,” DeSantis said in a Thursday briefing. He noted that Tampa even experienced a rare reverse storm surge, which pushed water away from the city rather than flooding it. Photos obtained by The Post show Cruise’s Clearwater penthouse, located just blocks away from the Church of Scientology’s international headquarters, appeared untouched after the storm passed. The sprawling 20,000-square-foot condo, which Cruise has called home since 2018, features two floors of luxury, complete with a 39-foot rooftop lap pool, a private car elevator and a flight simulator. The actor, known for his high-octane roles, even has an infinity pool, a hot tub and an outdoor dining area — all of which came through the storm unscathed. Cruise was in London when the hurricane hit. He was spotted arriving in the UK looking concerned just a day before Milton made landfall. The “Top Gun” star bought the lavish Clearwater pad in 2016 after selling his Beverly Hills mansion for a cool $39 million. Cruise’s penthouse was the brainchild of millionaire Scientologist Moises Agami, who initially planned to offer more affordable units in the building. However, as development progressed, those plans shifted, and the SkyView became home to Cruise’s deluxe penthouse. His Florida retreat, part of the SkyView complex, is not only luxurious, but also close to the Scientology headquarters — a major draw for the actor, who is one of the church’s most prominent members. The church’s headquarters, much like Cruise’s penthouse, emerged from the hurricane without damage. In a statement to The Post, the Church of Scientology emphasized their preparedness: “We are taking Hurricane Milton very seriously and have completed all preparations to secure our staff, parishioners and neighbors,” the organization said before the hurricane hit. “This includes boarding up all windows and vulnerable access to our properties and those of all the shops in the downtown area.” Cruise’s move to Clearwater was part of a significant shift in his real estate portfolio. In the years leading up to his relocation, he offloaded several high-profile properties, including a New York City townhouse and his sprawling Colorado estate.",
