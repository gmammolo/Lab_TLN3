We have more newsletters\nShow Me No thanks, close See our Privacy Notice Scotland is currently in the grip of cold conditions with a blast of polar air expected to last over the weekend . Snow is even expected to sweep across northern parts of the country and the first signs of winter appear.\nBut next week could see very different conditions with parts of Scotland set to basque in an &apos;Indian summer&apos;. Weather maps show temperatures nudging into double figures across the country.\nBut WXCharts has pinpointed five areas where temperatures will rise around 50% above the October average. Thursday, October 17 is set to be the warmest day of the month, especially in southern parts of the UK with temperatures nudging 20C.\nBut even in Scotland it will feel mild. Dundee is set to be the hotspot with temperatures reaching 16C. And 15C will be felt in the Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders areas near the border with England. Aberdeen and Perthshire will also be warm with temperatures around 14 or 15C.\nREAD MORE: Finally seeing the Northern Lights was a bucket list item ticked off and a perfect recharge for the soul\nREAD MORE: When do the clocks go back as British Summer Time 2024 comes to an end - and why some people want practice scrapped\nThursday is also scheduled to be dry in the east of the country, according to WXCharts. While those five areas will be the hotspots, the likes of Edinburgh and East Lothian will also feel pleasant if the charts are correct.\nThe Cairngorms will be the coldest place in the UK, but even then temperatures will reach 10C, the average daytime temperature for October. The warmer conditions should last into Friday before things navigate towards the norm for the weekend.\nWXCharts shows temperatures warming up in October (Image: WXCharts) Separately, the Met Office predicts \"low pressure to the west will become increasingly influential\" next midweek, bringing \"an increased chance of rain, showers and perhaps strong winds, especially in the west or northwest\". But it does back up WXCharts on warmth, saying: \"With winds from a southerly direction at first, temperatures will likely trend above average, with some warm conditions possible at times,\" before things cool again.\nFor more news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter but never miss the latest top headlines and sign up to our daily newsletter here .\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
