  "text": "By Lisa Hidalgo ,\n2 hours ago We are in for a beautiful fall weekend across Colorado!\nAfter another unseasonably warm 85-degree day on Thursday, a cold front will bring us some relief from the heat!\nThis weak, dry cold front is moving in early this morning over the northeastern plains. We'll see winds shift out of the north and it will usher in some slightly cooler weather for much of northeastern Colorado. We'll see highs in the mid-70s Friday afternoon and that's about 10 degrees cooler than Thursday!\nIt'll be a bit of a roller coaster ride of temperatures heading into the weekend.\nThe October heat returns for the first half with highs in the low-80s around Denver with mostly sunny skies. Winds will pick up a bit, so watch out for high fire danger across portions of the plains.\nAnother cold front will zip across the state late Saturday night into Sunday morning, dropping temperatures yet again. Daytime highs will be a bit closer to normal on Sunday, in the low n to mid-70s for the Broncos game!\nThe more fall-like weather sticks around early next week with highs in the low-to mid- 70s. Unfortunately, the dry weather continues into much of next week.\nDenver7 live 24/7 weather stream\nDENVER WEATHER LINKS: Hourly forecast | Radars | Traffic | Weather Page | 24/7 Weather Stream\nClick here to watch the Denver7 live weather stream.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
