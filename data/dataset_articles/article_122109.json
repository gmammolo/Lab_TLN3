  "text": "It has been a big year for the [northern lights](https://www.syracuse.com/weather/2024/09/aurora-awestruck-northern-lights-dance-above-upstate-ny-photos-video.html) in the Empire State. Central New York, however, has mostly been left out of the stunning, celestial party. But last night, it was our turn to see the [aurora borealis](https://www.syracuse.com/state/2024/08/awesome-aurora-see-epic-photos-of-northern-lights-in-upstate-ny.html) in its full, unforgettable glory. The northern lights appeared Thursday in the Syracuse area, starting in the evening before residents turned off their lights and headed to bed. The lights then faded for a few hours before strengthening again shortly before midnight. The aurora arrived as promised after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center issued a [severe geometric storm alert](https://www.syracuse.com/outdoors/2024/10/northern-lights-forecast-upgraded-to-severe-could-dazzle-upstate-ny-tonight-or-tomorrow.html) for Oct. 10 and Oct. 11 — delighting Central New Yorkers in Brewerton, Baldwinsville, Pompey, Syracuse and beyond. The generous northern lights didn’t leave the rest of the state out: Photographers across Upstate New York captured stunning shots of the aurora borealis dancing from Geneseo to Seneca Lake and from Niagara Falls to Lake George. While the aurora borealis is forecasted to be visible again in Upstate tonight, the Syracuse area isn’t expected to be included in the encore appearance, according to [NOAA’s aurora forecast](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental). But sky lovers in the Adirondacks, the North Country and the Niagara Falls area might get lucky. Check out the gorgeous snaps photographers captured of the northern lights dancing above CNY. And keep checking back: We’ll continue to add photos throughout the morning. Did you see the northern lights Thursday in Central New York? Please send your videos and photos to [socialmedia@syracuse.](mailto:socialmedia@syracuse.co)com, including where the image was taken and who the shot should be credited to.",
