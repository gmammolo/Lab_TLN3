  "text": "Mayorkas confirms FEMA has funds for hurricanes Milton and Helene plus tornadoes Mayorkas previously indicated that the agency did not have enough money to get through the rest of hurricane season, which ends in November, and urged Congress to return to session and pass more funds for disaster relief. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Thursday reassured Florida residents that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has enough money to help residents impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton, along with recent tornadoes caused by Milton. Mayorkas previously [indicated](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/finance/fema-doesnt-have-enough-funds-last-through-hurricane-season-spent-millions) that the agency did not have enough money to get through the rest of hurricane season, which ends in November, and urged Congress to return to session and pass more funds for disaster relief. The secretary echoed the call to Congress on Thursday, but said there was enough for the \"immediate needs.\" \"We have the resources to respond to the immediate needs of individuals impacted by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and ... the tornadoes associated with the hurricane,\" Mayorkas [said at a press briefing](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-sec-mayorkas-says-fema-will-need-additional-funds-after-hurricanes-helene-milton?intcmp=tw_fnc). \"That being said, we will need additional funds, and we implore Congress when it returns to, in fact, fund FEMA as is needed.\" The comment comes after FEMA [revealed](https://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/dual-barreled-hurricane-crisis-exposes-femas-chronic-staffing-shortages) that only eight percent of its front-line staff were available to help with Hurricane Milton. Mayorkas himself is in North Carolina to help oversee the federal response to Hurricane Helene. Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis has deployed 10,000 National Guard members to help with Milton, including 3,000 who have been sent from other states. Milton only impacted Florida, but has also triggered at least [19 tornadoes](https://justthenews.com/nation/states/hurricane-milton-makes-landfall-floridas-west-coast-major-storm) on Wednesday before making landfall.
