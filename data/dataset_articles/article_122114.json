  "text": "ROANOKE — The Blue Ridge Parkway from milepost 0 to milepost 198 in Virginia, which closed due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, will reopen at 8 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 11, the National Park Service announced. That includes the 198 miles of the scenic byway from Shenandoah National Park south to Virginia 685-Skyview Drive/Turkey Ridge Road (near Fancy Gap); the Humpback Rocks, James River and Peaks of Otter visitor centers will reopen, as power and water have been restored to all facilities where it existed before the storm. The Mabry Mill Cultural Site will be open, and the Eastern National/America’s National Parks sales outlet will operate from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Peaks of Otter and Rocky Knob campgrounds will operate on a first-come, first-served basis until Oct. 14, at which time existing reservations will again be honored. Otter Creek Campground was closed for the season prior to the storm and will remain closed. People are also reading… Peaks of Otter Lodge will continue to operate (it did not close after the storm). The National Park Service hopes to reopen the remainder of the parkway in Virginia within the next two weeks. Meanwhile, roughly 25 miles of New River Trail State Park have reopened to the public after Helene caused significant damage to the trail, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation announced Thursday. Visitors can now enjoy hiking, biking and horseback riding along the following sections, according to a DCR news release: - Roughly nine miles from the Galax park entrance to the Gambetta park entrance. This portion of the trail includes Chestnut Creek Falls. - Roughly three miles from mile marker 33 through mile marker 29. This portion of the trail includes the Ivanhoe park entrance, Ivanhoe River Bridge and Austinville park entrance. - Roughly 12 miles from the Shot Tower park entrance to mile marker 13. This portion of the trail includes Foster Falls. - Roughly eight miles from mile marker 10 to the Dora Junction park entrance. This portion of the trail includes the Dalton Bridge, Sloan Creek Trestle, Draper park entrance, McAdams Trestle and Peak Creek Trestle. To access these sections of the trail, guests can park at the following entrances: Galax, Cliffview, Chestnut Yard, Gambetta, Austinville, Shot Tower, Foster Falls, Draper and Dora Junction. Before navigating the trail, guests are encouraged to download the geo-referenced park map from Avenza Maps, according to the release. This free app is available on both iOS and Android.
