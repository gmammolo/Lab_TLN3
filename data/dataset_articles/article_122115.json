These people did Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez , John Tufts Louisville Courier Journal People around the country, including in Kentucky, were able to see the northern lights on Thursday evening with some viewers capturing images of them and posting them to social media.\nA social media user named Neil Javins posted pictures on X, formerly Twitter, and said the northern lights were \"Absolutely unbelievable to witness.\"\nHere's what you need to know:\nWere the northern lights visible in Kentucky? Sometimes pictures do more justice than with the naked eye. The #NorthernLights are an example of that! All of these shots coming in along the #OhioValley last night. pic.twitter.com/UsHi0LKPEK\n— Sam Gabrielli (@SamGabrielliwx) October 11, 2024 Absolutely unbelievable to witness #Aurora #northernlights #kentucky #kywx pic.twitter.com/c11sdPbGJp\n— Neil Javins (@njavins) October 11, 2024 Just took a quick field trip to Oldham County (Brownsboro, KY).

Kentucky is outside the viewing line for auroras appearing Friday night, Oct. 11, according to NOAA.\nNational Weather Service of Louisville meteorologist Brian Schoettmer said the severe geomagnetic storm is at a G-3, which is categorized as a quiet aurora, according to NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).\nSchoettmer said there is a chance people in Southern Indiana and Central Kentucky might see the auroras on Friday, but the chances are not as likely as they were on Thursday evening. He said the forecast calls for clear skies which can help with viewing.\nWhat is a severe geomagnetic storm? During a solar storm, an explosion of particles, energy, radiation and other matter can be blasted like a shotgun toward Earth by a solar flare. This material, called a coronal mass ejection (CME) can take 3-5 days to reach our planet, according to NASA . When it does, the CME can interfere with Earth's magnetic field, creating what experts call a geomagnetic storm.\nThese storms, depending on their strength, can interfere with radio waves and cause power outages. But they also produce beautiful auroras as Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere shields us from the worst of the geomagnetic storm.\nTips for viewing the northern lights Experts say the best auroras are usually within an hour or two of midnight (between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time). These hours expand towards evening and morning as the level of geomagnetic activity increases. There may be aurora in the evening and morning, but it is usually not as active and therefore, not as visually appealing, according to NOAA.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
