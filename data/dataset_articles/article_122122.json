  "text": "MONTANA - A noticeable shift in weather has brought cooler temperatures and improved air quality to the region. A cold front has delivered temporary relief from the heat, moving temperatures away from recent highs in the 80s.\nAir quality has significantly improved, especially near the Elk Fire area, now classified in the green category, indicating good conditions. However, moderate levels and potential unhealthy air quality remain a possibility for sensitive groups along the Montana-Idaho State Line to the south.\nLooking ahead, Montanans can expect a generally dry end to the work week and a picturesque weekend. \"We're seeing mainly clear skies heading into Sunday as well, so definitely enjoy that weekend forecast,\" the local weather forecast stated.\nWinds today will vary, starting light to breezy, with gusty easterly winds expected in eastern Montana. Breezy conditions are forecasted to continue into the weekend, aided by northerly winds that have helped clear wildfire smoke in Wyoming.\nToday's temperatures will sit mainly in the 60s and 70s, still above seasonal averages but generally comfortable. However, northern areas across the High Line may experience chillier weather, with temperatures fluctuating around the freezing mark.\nDry conditions are anticipated for the next several days, extending into early next week. A cold front from the Pacific Northwest could arrive by Thursday, bringing crucial changes in temperature and much-needed precipitation. This shift is expected to bring more seasonal fall-like temperatures to the region, dropping from the 70s to the 50s.\nResidents are advised to enjoy the current pleasant conditions while they last.\nCurrent Contests Glacier Gallows Contest",
