  "text": "A spectacular display of auroras lit up the skies over Leh, India, on October 10, 2024, following a severe geomagnetic storm triggered by a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun. The vibrant auroras were observed at Hanle, home to India’s highest observatory, captivating onlookers with their brilliant hues against the night sky. This celestial event was caused by an X1.8 solar flare that erupted on October 9, sending charged particles towards Earth at speeds exceeding 1.5 million miles per hour. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified the geomagnetic storm as G4, indicating severe conditions that could disrupt power grids and satellite operations. Such intense storms can push the visibility of auroras much further south than usual, with reports of sightings as far away as Alabama and northern California in the United States. The auroras observed in Leh featured stunning reds and greens, providing a breathtaking spectacle for both residents and tourists. This phenomenon is part of a broader cycle of heightened solar activity as the Sun approaches its solar maximum, expected to peak in 2025. This cycle has resulted in an uptick in solar flares and CMEs, which produce auroras when charged particles interact with Earth’s magnetic field. While the display was awe-inspiring, scientists cautioned that the geomagnetic storm could lead to various disruptions. High-frequency radio communications were already facing interference, and concerns were raised regarding potential impacts on satellite navigation systems. Power companies and aviation authorities were advised to monitor conditions closely to mitigate any adverse effects. As the community revelled in the celestial light show, experts underscored the importance of understanding space weather's influence on technology and infrastructure. This geomagnetic event serves as a reminder of the Sun’s dynamic nature and its significant impact on life on Earth.
