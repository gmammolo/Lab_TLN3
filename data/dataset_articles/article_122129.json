  "text": "We will see more sunshine through the weekend as temps also increase into the mid 70s, just a few degrees above average. A very quiet weekend ahead in terms of weather after partly to mostly cloudy skies clear today. Next week starts with sunny skies and 70s before another trough passes through the region Tuesday night. The axis extends south and the longwave crosses the region through Wednesday morning. This will pull the upper jet stream south over the PNW leading to cooler temps in the 60s, rain on the west side of the Cascades with showers drifting across the shadow of the mountains to the east. A slight chance of some snow in the crests of the Cascades and MAYBE the tippy tops of the Blues. It would be very light so if you're climbing the mountains you'll notice some flurries but the snow line doesn't drop low enough to have a major impact at this time. Most precipitation will be rain in the mountains and the lower elevations. We will see wind speeds increase Tuesday afternoon/evening ahead of this next system's arrival Wednesday morning. Highs could even drop as cool as the low 60s and upper 50s by the end of next week making it feel more like fall by the weekend. Tri-Cities: Friday: Partly cloudy... 68/40 Saturday: Mostly sunny... 73/42 Sunday: Sunny... 72/41 Monday: Sunny... 75/47 Tuesday: Mostly sunny... 74/51 Wednesday: Partly to mostly cloudy, windy showers... 67/46 Thursday: Mostly cloudy, breezy strays... 62/43 Yakima: Friday: Partly cloudy... 66/37 Saturday: Sunny... 72/40 Sunday: Sunny... 74/39 Monday: Sunny... 75/46 Tuesday: Mostly sunny... 73/45 Wednesday: Partly to mostly cloudy, windy showers... 64/40 Thursday: Mostly cloudy, windy showers... 60/38",
