(WNEM) - It’s been another beautiful day around Mid-Michigan with plenty of sunshine and pleasant October temperatures. We’ll be watching the dry conditions tomorrow that have slightly overshadowed our beautiful weather lately, with Fire Weather Watches in place on Friday. Our winds will pick up, which will make burning dangerous. You can find more info on those watches on our [Weather Alerts page](//wnem.com/weather/alerts). We also had some areas added to the [Drought Monitor](https://www.wnem.com/2024/10/10/fire-weather-watch-friday-parts-mid-michigan-now-drought-stage/). This Evening & Overnight We expect a beautiful evening tonight, with mostly clear skies around the area. Temperatures in the 50s and 60s this afternoon once again are expected to drop off into the 40s, but not much further than that tonight. A southwesterly wind should keep us a bit warmer than the last few nights. All signs seem to be pointing to a good shot at seeing the northern lights tonight, so dress warm and get somewhere dark and look north if you plan on being up late tonight. We will of course let you know when we start getting sightings around the area, but you may be able to see them without waiting up too late tonight. Going out right when it gets dark tonight may even provide a chance. As always, space weather is never a guarantee. But so far, things look good as we move into tonight. We’ll do our best to keep you updated. Friday Friday we expect increasing clouds over the area and there may be a little wildfire smoke overhead, but beyond that, there should still be some sunshine poking through. Southwesterly winds will be breezy around 10 to 20 miles per hour with gusts near 25 to 30 miles per hour. Those winds will bring increased fire danger, so Red Flag Warnings will likely replace the Fire Weather Watches on Friday. Highs will benefit from those southwesterly winds, with 70s expected on Friday as we wrap up the workweek. We’ll be well above average on Friday, with a beautiful finish to the workweek. A cold front sweeping through the area may bring a slight chance for a light shower or sprinkle on Friday evening, but right now we don’t expect that to be a widespread chance. The front doesn’t have a ton of moisture to work with, so anything that develops will be fighting an uphill battle. As always, we’ll monitor conditions tomorrow morning and see if we need to up that chance. Copyright 2024 WNEM. All rights reserved.",
