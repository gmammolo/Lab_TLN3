  "text": "Spectacular Northern Lights in Michigan expected to make an encore Friday night LANSING — The Northern Lights put on a show across Michigan Thursday night, and could light up the skies again Friday night. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Forecast page says we will experience [a G4-level, or severe, geomagnetic storm](https://www.spaceweather.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) impact which will lead to numerous events — one of which is visible aurora borealis much farther south than typical. What's making the Northern Lights brighter? Earlier this week, the sun experienced a large solar storm that is sending a burst of radiation toward Earth. The [radiation interacts with the planet's magnetic field,](https://www.mtu.edu/tour/copper-country/northern-lights/) causing particles to collide and release energy in a burst of light. Solar storm radiation output is measured by \"Kp.\" A \"3\" rating means the aurora is relatively quiet, and generally only visible as far south as the Lake Superior basin or southern Canada. A Kp rating of 7 will allow the northern lights to shine over mid-Michigan and stronger solar storms reaching Kp 9 can send the northern lights as far south as Kentucky. The predictions for Friday is for 8.0 Kp event. Here's what people are sharing online: [Northern Lights put on a show in Michigan](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2024/10/11/northern-lights-michigan-aurora-borealis/75625572007/) Will the solar storm affect Michigan in other ways? NOAA says the solar storm could affect a variety of electric and electronic systems on Earth. There will be \"possible widespread voltage control problems and some protective systems will mistakenly trip out key assets from the grid,\" NOAA said. In addition, spacecraft, like the International Space Station, could experience surface charging and tracking problems, and corrections may be needed for orientation problems. Radios on Earth could experience sporadic issues, satellite navigation may be degraded for hours, and low-frequency radio navigation could be disrupted. Will the Northern Lights be visible Friday night? The National Weather Service's Grand Rapids office [says the weather should cooperate](https://www.weather.gov/grr/) Friday night. \"High pressure will control our weather through Friday, providing the region with mostly clear conditions,\" the weather service said. A cold front arrives Friday night and that will start a cooling trend that will last into early next week. Periods of showers will accompany the cooler weather, the NWS said. When's the best time to see the Northern Lights? [The best aurora borealis](https://www.spaceweather.gov/content/tips-viewing-aurora) viewing is usually within an hour or two of midnight, NOAA said. \"The hours of active aurora expand towards evening and morning as the level of geomagnetic activity increases. There may be aurora in the evening and morning, but it is usually not as active and therefore, not as visually appealing,\" NOAA said. The best seasons for aurora watching are around the spring and fall equinoxes. There is a tendency towards larger geomagnetic storms, and thus better auroras, to occur near the equinoxes. Where can I see the Northern Lights? Generally, all you may need to do is get away from city lights. Any dark patch of sky should provide a glimmer of the celestial event. You're in luck though if you're looking for someplace darker. [Michigan has a number of dark sky parks and international dark sky parks.](https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/places/state-parks/dark-sky-events) The Lake Hudson Recreation Area in Lenawee County, Negwegon State Park in Alcona County, Port Crescent State Park in Huron County, Rockport Recreation Area and Thompson's Harbor State Park in Presque Isle County, and Wilderness State Park in Emmet County all offer [specially designated dark sky preserves ](https://www.michigan.org/darksky)for viewing. In addition, Headlands Dark Sky Park in Emmet County, Keweenaw Dark Sky Park in Keweenaw County and Dr. T.K. Lawless Park in Cass County are designated as international dark sky parks. Beaver Island State Wildlife Research Area is a designated international dark sky sanctuary. Michigan also offers a variety of other [great locations](https://www.michigan.org/article/trip-idea/most-stellar-places-stargazing-michigan) that aren't necessarily designated as dark sky areas, but are still well away from interfering lights. When is the next full moon? [October's Hunter's Moon is also super](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2024/10/08/full-moon-october-2024-hunters-moon-supermoon/75559198007/) Can I see the Northern Lights near Lansing? Viewing in city parks may be compromised by lights from nearby buildings. Here's [a list](https://www.lansingmi.gov/524/Parks) of city parks. Ingham County parks all close at sunset, unless otherwise posted. Check the county's[ list of parks](https://pk.ingham.org/parks/index.php) for further information. Sleepy Hollow State Park in Victor Township may provide viewing.
