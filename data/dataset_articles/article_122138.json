[Click here](https://www.tnsattorneys.com/) to learn more and to get in touch. Long Island was treated to a rare and vibrant display of the Northern Lights Thursday night, lighting up the sky in a dazzling array of colors. Thanks to a rare [geomagnetic storm](https://greaterlongisland.com/northern-lights-could-be-viewable-again-this-week-on-long-island/), the aurora was visible as far south as Alabama, with the best views on Long Island around 7 p.m. The Northern Lights have been viewable multiple times this year on the Island, including in [August](https://greaterlongisland.com/northern-lights-viewable-once-again-on-long-island/) and [May](https://greaterlongisland.com/great-photos-long-islanders-took-of-the-northern-lights-this-past-weekend/). Long Islanders didn’t miss the chance to capture the moment, sharing stunning views to [Greater Long Island](http://greaterlongisland.com) on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/greaterlongisland/posts/pfbid02TqaJhmuC9rCbMWeWWvmjSxrgY73GsYKmiPxrSNfUsSghscXthpKH7jbdosNUz3Kol).
