  "text": "MACON, Ga. — Many members of the 13WMAZ Weather Network Facebook group shared some extraordinary photos of the northern lights over Central Georgia Thursday. While very faint to the naked eye, when people pulled out their phones, they captured a beautiful skyscape of pink and purple. It is the second time this year the Northern Lights graced the skies here in Georgia. Back in May, [Central Georgia also got a taste of the astronomical phenomena](/article/news/local/northern-lights-seen-across-central-georgia-check-out-photos-magical-phenomena/93-0f44a3b3-164e-4903-b5ea-0dba14e7ae43), producing beautiful sights when turning your phone to the sky. This time around, here's a look at some of the best photos that were shared in the 13WMAZ Weather Network. But it's not too late to share your own! For more on how to join, click here . In Rentz in Laurens County, Tony Taylor captured this magnificent view of the Northern Lights. Carmen Smith shared this photo of the Northern Lights from Baldwin County. Julie Presley EA shared these photos of the skies in Forsyth. Shalonna Guy shared this photo of the Northern Lights from Butler in Taylor County Also in Taylor County, Denise Workman shared this photo of the Nothern Lights. In the skies over Lizella, Peggy Mazo Bailey shared the Northern Lights from a backyard. Andrea Veal Brewer captured the Northern Lights gracing the skies over Lake Sinclair. In the skies over Centerville, Patricia Martin Carter shared this photo of the Northern Lights. Brandi Shay shared this photo from Rentz. She says that you can't see it with the naked eye, but when she took the photo on her iPhone, the Northern Lights appeared. Elizabeth Cunard Copeman shared this photo of the Northern Lights from Dudley. Now, if you're wondering what the northern lights are, here is a simplified explanation. Normally, charged particles from the sun get in near the poles because the orientation of the magnetic field creates an opening. Those particles create the red, purple, pink or green colors in the sky. However, typically, it is only visible in areas closer to the poles. But a G4 geomagnetic storm occurred, meaning more charged particles that produce the northern lights were emitted. That has allowed the phenomena to be seen in more parts of the U.S., including Central Georgia. We'd still love to see your photos! You can share them in the 13WMAZ Weather Network or on our Facebook page.",
