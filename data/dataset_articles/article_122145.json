The aurora borealis seemed to be more prominent on Thursday than it had been earlier in the week. In Petoskey, handfuls of people gathered at Sunset Park and along the waterfront to watch the cosmic show.

The stellar display was amplified when a solar coronal mass ejection of plasma clouds and charged particles drove a geomagnetic storm toward Earth. The storm was so strong that it prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to issue a rare G4 geomagnetic storm watch for the second time this year. — Contact Jillian Fellows at jfellows@petoskeynews.com.",
