  "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Just about everyone seems to be interested in the weather.\nEvery year since 1792, forecasts have been a key component of The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\nThough the forecasts are made months in advance, they have proven to be amazingly accurate, its publishers say.\nAlready on the shelves of stores across the nation, the 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac is predicting a “calmer, gentler” winter for many parts of the United States.\nThat would be good news for those of us who live in the Midwest.\n“This winter, temperatures will be up and snowfall down throughout most parts of the United States,” says Carol Connare, the Almanac’s editor. “While there will still be plenty of winter chill out there and powdery snow to enjoy, the high costs associated with the season shouldn’t hit so hard.\n“It will be, by and large, a very temperate, uneventful winter and potentially a welcome reprieve from the extremes of recent years.”\nThere will be exceptions to those predictions, something the Almanac doesn’t shy away from noting. Winter rainstorms will leave Florida, the Deep South and southern California sopped and soaked, Meanwhile, heavy snowfall is expected in central and southern Appalachia, the western Ohio Valley and the Rockies — which will be welcome news for skiers.\nA more moderate winter will eventually give way to a sweltering summer, especially for folks without air-conditioning, the Almanac predicts. The new edition shares the best ways to beat the summer heat, including advice on how to make an inexpensive, homemade air-conditioning unit from a box fan and 1-liter bottles.\nThe 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac also explores: how tomatoes -- once dismissed as “odious and repelling-smelling berries” by The Horticulturalist -- became North America’s favorite vegetable; the surprising Canadian history of America’s favorite pastime; and why incidences of “white dragons” -- also known as avalanches -- are on the rise. In addition, the Almanac looks into whether Earth is on a collision course with the collection of space rubble known as “Bennu.”\nBeyond weather prognostications, the newest edition of The Old Farmer’s Almanac features a healthy dose of wit and wisdom along with tried-and-true advice, including:\n• Trick a garden located anywhere into growing almost anything\n• Start and care for a backyard flock of chickens\n• Catch, cook, and truly appreciate Nature’s original “fish sticks” — that is, smelts.\n• Garden by the cycles of the Moon\n• Understand and interpret the curious behaviors of cats\n• Find health and happiness in a cup of tea\n• Give the perfect hug\nIn an email interview, the Almanac’s associate editor Tim Goodwin discussed what keeps the publication fresh and relevant after 233 years.\n• What is new this year with the 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac?\n“There is a great collection of features that grace the Almanac pages in the 2025 edition, covering all the subjects that Almanac readers have come to expect. For gardeners, there are stories about tomatoes, gardening by the Moon, and how to trick plants to be ‘Zone Cheaters.’ We received a large collection of recipes for our holiday recipe contest and, after extensive testing, we narrowed it down to the top four to share. We explain why your cat does some of those curious behaviors, the folklore behind the ocean tides, and why you should be aware of Bennu. Add in the Canadian roots of America’s pastime, the science behind avalanches, and the best way to give -- and receive -- a hug, and the 2025 Almanac truly has something that will interest everyone.\n“And, of course, all the mainstays of the Almanac return — from the calendar pages and regional weather forecasts, to the astronomical data and gardening charts that are handy throughout the year.”\n• Why do you think the Almanac stays popular year after year? What’s its appeal?\n“For one thing, the iconic yellow cover is immediately recognizable and we like to think it brings upon a sense of nostalgia. We have been published every year since 1792 -- the oldest continuously published periodical in North America -- and the love of the Almanac is something that is passed down through the generations. With 2.5 million copies distributed each year, the Almanac is in the hands of so many people across the country and our faithful readers love to share what the Almanac is all about.\n“The appeal is what the Almanac provides. There is no other publication where you can get this kind of wealth of information — which has been tirelessly edited, fact-checked, and proofed—in one place and it’s something that you can use throughout the year.\n“The Almanac is so well known for its long-range weather forecasts and that’s what so many people come back for year after year, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.”\n• What makes the Old Farmer’s Almanac unique?\n“Outside of the long-range weather forecasts, it’s the useful information that it provides. Where else can you get information about upcoming eclipses, what to see in the night sky each month, and the rise and set times of the Sun and the Moon in the same book as the first and last frost dates for the year, when to set eggs, and the best day to have dental work, mow your grass to promote growth, and go camping based on the Moon’s sign? But it’s far from just dates and charts, the carefully chosen collection of features in gardening, food, astrology, astronomy, etc., provide insight into many topics that offer a new perspective with a wealth of knowledge.”\n• Who is the primary audience for the Almanac?\n“We like to think the Almanac has something for everybody. Whether you’re passionate about weather, gardening, astronomy, or food, there is a story that will make you say ‘I never knew that!’ There will be data, dates, times, conversions that help you in everyday life. If someone out there doesn’t believe the Almanac is for them, pick it up and give it a look because you might be surprised how much will interest you.”\n• How do you appeal to younger audiences?\n“It’s all about providing new information that will pique everyone’s interest. Since we have such a long history, there is a reasonable assumption that most folks know what the Almanac is or have least seen it -- again that yellow cover -- so it is important to make sure that each year is unique. You want to have that historical aspect, the pages and sections that are hallmarks of the OFA, but at the same time we always want to make sure that we provide our readers—new and returning, younger and older—with a reason to pick it up throughout the year and, of course, the next year.\n“Younger readers are value-conscious and we are giving them something that is useful every day of the year for less than $10. Also, there’s new interest in the old ways—ways of gardening for instance—that have stood the test of time.”\n• Everyone is interested in the weather, it seems -- how does the Almanac make its predictions so far in advance and how accurate are the forecasts?\n“There is a great interest in the Almanac’s long-range forecasts. When the OFA comes out each year, we talk to radio and TV stations, as well as podcasts and newspapers across the country and in Canada. We also get questions through our website about weather predictions well in advance for specific dates as people plan weddings, events, and trips based on the OFA.\n“When Robert B. Thomas started the Almanac and the long-range forecasts, he did so with the belief that weather on Earth was influenced by sunspots—magnetic storms on the surface of the Sun. We still use solar science as part of the three scientific disciplines employed to make our forecasts, along with climatology and meteorology. We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions, using among other things, 30-year statistical averages prepared by government meteorological agencies to predict temperature and precipitation deviations from averages, or normal.\n“Our results are typically very close to our traditional claim of 80%, but of course some years are better than others. That’s just how it goes when predicting the weather.\n“It really depends on where you live, because for some zip codes and regions we are spot on or very close, while in other areas we miss by a larger margin. For Topeka, we predicted November 2023 to March 2024 would be .5 inches over normal precipitation and it was actually .2.”\n• What’s the greatest appeal of the Almanac, especially in a world that seems to be changing so quickly?\n“I think the appeal is that The Old Farmer’s Almanac has stayed true to its roots for 233 years and readers know what to expect. When Robert B. Thomas founded the OFA, he laid a foundation for this yearly periodical that still remain to this day. It continues to be a calendar of the heavens and provide long-range weather forecasts much like it did in the beginning. Not everyone is looking for the ‘latest and greatest,’ and there’s a draw to something that not only has lasted over two centuries and can be a link to previous moments in time, but also be current and informative. And, part of our mission is to have a pleasant degree of humor as stated by the founder himself, and who couldn’t use a little more lightheartedness in their day?\n“We saw last year how the winter just wasn’t as cold and our forecast for the 2024–25 winter reflects what we have seen in recent years. A good portion of the country, including the Heartland (where Topeka resides) will experience more milder temperatures this winter, while areas that typically see snow will not see as much snow when compared to those 30-year averages. As for summer 2025, most of the country should be prepared for hot and dry conditions.”\n• Do city folks read it as well as those in the country?\n“The Almanac has something for everyone, especially people who like to grow things. You don’t have to live in an area where it is farmland and acres of land for gardens, people do a lot with patios and even windowsills. The Almanac can be “useful, with a pleasant degree of humor” no matter where you live. Whether you’re interested in astronomy, gardening, or food, or simply like to be presented with new interesting material, you will find something in the Almanac. You can garden anywhere, observe the night sky in all different locations, and cooking is a universal language that isn’t governed by where you live. Pick it up and see for yourself!”\n• Where can people pick up copies?\n“Anywhere books and magazines are sold! Many retailers — like supermarkets, pharmacies, bookstores, and wherever you buy gardening supplies like Lowe’s, Tractor Supply and Walmart — carry The Old Farmer’s Almanac. If folks can’t find it, they can go to almanac.com/wheretobuy and select what state they live in and a list of retailers will be provided. It can also be ordered on almanac.com/shop or through Amazon and sent right to your mailbox.”\n• Anything else?\n“We are currently working hard on the 2026 edition, which will have at least a few stories celebrating America’s 250th anniversary. And the OFA brand is more than just the Almanac: we have an annual Garden Guide, an OFA Kids that comes out every other year (Volume 11 will hit the shelves next summer), a collection of calendars, a planner, and a gardening handbook series!”\nThe new edition includes all of this, plus the Almanac’s “Trends” predictions for 2025; the humor of “Anecdotes & Pleasantries”; “Mind-Mangling” puzzles; award-winning holiday recipes; and weather forecasts for all 18 regions of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.\nFor those who live on farms -- and those who reside in cities, towns and villages across the country -- The Old Farmers’s Almanac offers an enjoyable and entertaining way to spend some time on a cold winter’s night, or evenings in the spring, summer and fall, for that matter.\nPick it up, take a few minutes to glance at some of the material it contains, and chances are you’ll find out something you didn’t previously know, while having a good time learning about it.\nThe Old Farmer’s Almanac — with its iconic yellow cover and classic corner hole — originates from Yankee Publishing Inc., a 100% employee-owned company in Dublin, N.H.\nThe Almanac’s editors also produce their annual Garden Guide ; digital monthly magazine EXTRA !; The Old Farmer’s Almanac for Kids Vol. 10, now available; and a collection of wall and desk calendars, including The Old Farmer’s Almanac Planner .\nThey also publish a collection of gardening titles, such as the Container Gardener’s Handbook , released in Spring 2024; the Flower Gardener’s Handbook ; and the Vegetable Gardener’s Handbook , now in its seventh printing.\nThe 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac is available for a cover price of $9.95 wherever books and magazines are sold. A full list of stores that carry The Old Farmer’s Almanac is available at Almanac.com/Wheretobuy .\nPrint and digital copies of The 2025 Old Farmer’s Almanac also are available online at Almanac.com/Shop and on Amazon.\nDaily Almanac wit and wisdom are available through Almanac.com , Facebook , Pinterest , Instagram , TikTok , and the Amazon Echo voice assistant.\nCopyright 2024 WIBW.
