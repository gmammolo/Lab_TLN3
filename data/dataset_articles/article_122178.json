  "text": "SAN ANGELO, TX - San Angelo residents were treated to a rare glimpse of the Northern Lights late on Oct. 10, as the auroras reached as far south as Texas following a powerful solar storm. The National Weather Service in San Angelo confirmed that the aurora was faintly visible to the naked eye in the area, though more pronounced through cameras. Residents across Texas are encouraged to keep an eye out for the display in the coming nights. [The recent light show is the result of a strong geomagnetic storm](https://sanangelolive.com/news/outdoors/2024-10-10/strong-geomagnetic-storm-could-bring-northern-lights-texas-tonight) caused by a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun on Oct. 8. The CME sent a cloud of plasma and charged particles hurtling toward Earth, generating auroras across latitudes far beyond their usual range. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified the solar event as a G4-level storm, one step below the most severe level of G5. The storm arrived in Earth’s atmosphere on Oct. 10 and is expected to last through Saturday, Oct. 12. While auroras are typically seen at higher latitudes, the strength of this storm has expanded their visibility, allowing those in Texas to witness the Northern Lights potentially. Areas as far south as Dallas, Wichita Falls, and Amarillo stand a good chance of seeing the auroras again in the coming days, particularly in locations with low light pollution. However, the NWS cautioned that the likelihood of seeing the aurora again in San Angelo may be lower tonight, as the chances were likely better during the initial wave of the storm. “Auroras are like weather and are not the easiest thing to predict,” the NWS said in a social media post. They advised locals to remain hopeful and watch for updates as space weather experts continue to monitor the situation. Those wanting to catch a glimpse of the auroras are advised to get away from city lights and look toward the northern horizon, particularly late at night when the sky is darkest. With clear skies expected in parts of Texas, the Northern Lights may continue to put on a rare and spectacular show through the weekend. According to NWS auroras have been seen in Texas before, with the most recent occurrence in May, although cloud cover obstructed the view locally at that time. Another notable instance of auroras visible this far south occurred in 2003. The current sightings come as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year sunspot cycle, a period when solar storms and solar flares are more frequent and intense, increasing the likelihood of auroras being visible in southern regions like Texas. The NWS will provide further updates as more information becomes available from NOAA and space weather experts. Most Recent Videos Post a comment to this article here:",
