  "text": "Could northern lights be visible across Ohio again tonight?\nA powerful solar storm on the sun has made for some great views in the sky in some parts of greater Cincinnati Thursday.\nOne viewer, Chris, from Brookville, Indiana, captured a beautiful view of the auroras.\nThe colorful solar spectacle is all due to a geomagnetic storm.\nExperts say, it's triggered by a number of solar flares.\nUsually, you can only see the northern lights in high latitudes.\nBut, during these intense solar storms, they can be seen as far south as Alabama and in the Ohio River Valley.\nMany may remember the solar storm in May that resulted in auroras being visible across the country, including in Cincinnati.\nSpace weather forecasters say there has been an uptick in activity during this storm cycle than in ones previous as they've seen roughly four severe storms.\nSo could we have a chance at seeing them again Friday night? According to experts, they are less likely to show up as far south as they did Thursday night, but again, they are hard to predict far in advance.",
