  "text": "pQuiet into at least the start of our weekend. Friday will be the warmest day just ahead of a cold front with 70's for daytime highs. We may squeeze out a shower or two Friday afternoon but a better chance for some rain (lighter showers) arrives Sunday into early next week along with the coldest temperatures of the fall season so far. <>pFIRE DANGER: Much of Northern Lower Michigan is under a Fire Weather Watch for critical fire danger Friday. The combination of above normal temperatures, gusty SW to NW winds up to 30 mph and dry fuels with the lack of rain could lead to the rapid spread/development of a wildfire if it were to escape a contained area. <>pNORTHERN LIGHTS will be possible tonight. We have G2-G4 strong to severe geomagnetic storm levels tonight and Friday evening. Cloud cover will be an issue with partly cloudy skies but you do have a chance of viewing the northern lights. The Kp index will peak at 6 between 7pm to 7am Eastern Time Thursday night. <>pFRIDAY (OCT 11): Friday will be the warmest day of the forecast out ahead of a cold front approaching Northern Michigan with skies clouding up some so mostly cloudy overall to end the workweek. With gusty winds expected, we will have elevated fire danger. A few showers could develop along our approaching cold front Friday afternoon but they'll be hit and miss at best. High temperatures will reach 67-79F. SW to NW wind 15-25 mph and gusty. br<>pSATURDAY (OCT 12): Cooler (but comfortable) weather Saturday along with dry conditions setting up a nice start to the weekend. There won't a be a lot of sunshine however as skies will trend mostly cloudy to even overcast in the afternoon/evening hours. I suppose an afternoon sprinkle or two is possible in the Lower Peninsula but most spots will remain dry. Forecast high temperatures will reach between 55-60F. NE to SSE wind 5-10 mph. <>pSUNDAY (OCT 13): Low pressure passes south of the region Sunday but will sweep in the chance for some rain at times Sunday across Northern Michigan with cloudy to mostly cloudy skies. <>pLONGER RANGE FORECAST: Wrap-around showers will persist into Monday and Tuesday but will not be very heavy. The coolest weather of the autumn season so far arrives early next week with highs Monday and Tuesday only in the upper-40's/low-50's across Northern Michigan. Temperatures rebound some later next week. <>p-Meteorologist Joe Charlevoix<>",
