  "text": "Thanksgiving weekend is upon us and that means turkey dinners and fall yard cleanups. After a few weeks of mostly cool and wet weather, the long weekend forecast for Prince George promises temperatures well above normal for this time of year with only a small chance of rain – at least for Saturday and most of Sunday. But Monday is expected to be rainy, so if you have outdoor activities on your agenda you’d best get to that early in the weekend. We’re heading for a high today of 11 C and an overnight low of -2 C, but Saturday is looking spectacular, with a sunny high of 16 C – six degrees above average. Clouds are expected to move in Saturday night and that will keep the overnight temperatures from dropping below 7 C. Expect cloudy skies on Sunday with a high of 16 C and a low of 6 C, with a 30 per cent chance of showers at night. Clouds will continue to build on Thanksgiving Monday and the chance of rain will increase to 60 per cent with a forecast high of 10 C, dropping to -1 C overnight. The start of the work week on Tuesday will bring a mix of sun and cloud with the high reaching 11 C. More wet weather in store for Wednesday and a predicted high of 8 C.",
