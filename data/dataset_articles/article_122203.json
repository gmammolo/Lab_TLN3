  "text": "A warm end to the week with rain chances Saturday ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - This afternoon will feel much more like August as highs will be in the middle 80s with a good amount of sunshine. We will have a few clouds here and there, I’ll chalk it up to partly cloudy. Winds will be on the gusty side out of the southwest near 25 mph, bringing in this warm dry air. The strong wind and dry air will make it dangerous to burn outside so please avoid if you are able. Overnight tonight, a cold front will make it’s way through, shifting our winds to be out of the northeast. Clouds will stick around through the night with lows staying in the mid-50s. Winds continue to shift Saturday to be out of the east. The winds along with some cloud cover in the afternoon will give us a much more fall like day as highs top out in the upper 60s. I can’t rule out an stray shower or storm late tomorrow afternoon/evening as there will be some instability in our atmosphere. The issue with our rain chances comes down to how much moisture is in the atmosphere. It has been exceptionally dry the past few weeks and dewpoints will still be on the lower end. With this in mind any rain will be few and far between but still the chance exists. Yet another cold front will make it’s way through Saturday night which will give us a little bit better chance for showers or a rumble or two, but again we will be dry so it will be more on the scattered side. Lows overnight will bottom out in the mid-40s. Northwesterly winds will be howling Sunday as some gusts could reach 35 mph. This will lower temperatures yet again to the mid-60s. Otherwise, Sunday looks to be pretty pleasant with a few clouds here and there. Looking ahead to the start of next week, it is going to be chilly. Highs will be in the upper to middle 50s, with overnight lows near freezing. This means our first frost chances of the season are likely. Copyright 2024 WIFR. All rights reserved.",
