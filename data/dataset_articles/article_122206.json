  "text": "I don’t if other Denver area residents will agree, but this week finally felt like it was actually fall even though the temperature reached 80°F pretty much every day. Fortunately over the next week the temperature is set to keep decreasing, with highs in the 60°s looking not too far away. Plus, mountain weather meteorologist Chris Tomer has some good snow-related news for several parts of the Intermountain West.\nChris Tomer is an avid skier and trail runner, bringing his love for the outdoors into his mountain weather forecasts. With them, he helps winter recreators around North America make the best weather dependent plans he possibly can. He’s also been in weather consulting for around 20 years providing vital information for expeditions around the world, including at least one on all fourteen of the world’s 8,000 meter peaks.\nThere’s not a load of snowfall headed to the lower 48 over the next 10 days but there is a few inches in some places, and that’s more than we’ve had in a while. Northern Washington mountains seem like they’ll be the biggest winners, with Mount Baker potentially seeing 9 inches of snow. Big Sky in Montana has a forecasted 5 inches of snowfall and in Colorado many mountains could see 2-3 inches. Again, not a ton of snow, but at least it’s a start!\nAbout Chris Tomer:\nTomer earned a B.S. in Meteorology from Valparaiso University graduating with Honors – where he also played basketball. Tomer minored in mathematics and broadcasting. Tomer is a fully certified meteorologist having earned the CBM and NWA Seal’s of Approval. Tomer also serves on the NWA panel of Television Seal evaluators. Chris has specialized knowledge of Mountain Meteorology.",
