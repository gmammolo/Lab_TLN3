YOU DEFINITELY WANTED A JACKET OUT THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY TO WORK. BOONE DROPPED DOWN TO 32 THIS MORNING HERE AT PTI. WE GOT DOWN TO 45, WHICH IS STILL PRETTY CHILLY, BUT SOME OF OUR OUTLYING COOLER SPOTS DROP DOWN INTO THE 30S. IT WAS ACTUALLY OUR COOLEST MORNING SINCE BACK IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. APRIL 23RD. THERE WAS EVEN SOME PATCHY FROST IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS MORNING, WHICH IS KIND OF RIGHT ON TIME FOR THAT FIRST FROST. WE USUALLY SEE IT DURING THE EARLY PART OF OCTOBER IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE MIDDLE PART OF THE MONTH FOR THE FOOTHILLS, AND THEN LIKELY LATE OCTOBER IS WHEN WE USUALLY SEE THAT FIRST FROST HERE IN THE PIEDMONT. BUT NO, NO WORRIES WITH FROST. THIS AFTERNOON. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. CLEAR BLUE SKIES, NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN. WE’VE GOTTEN UP INTO THE LOW TO MID 60S. VERY COMFORTABLE OUTSIDE WITH THAT. THAT NICE MILD REFRESHING AIR. AND IT’S GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL REST OF OUR DAY TOO. WE’LL GET INTO THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 LATER THIS AFTERNOON, BUT PLENTY OF SUN AND A NICE BREEZE WILL HELP IT FEEL SUPER A GREAT WEATHER FOR GOING TO THE FAIR, OR MAYBE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES LATER THIS EVENING TOO, BUT JUST UNDERSTAND, ONCE THAT SUN SETS, IT’S GOING TO COOL OFF PRETTY QUICKLY. SO YOU MIGHT WANT A JACKET OR A HOODIE OR A SWEATSHIRT LATER ON THIS EVENING. IF YOU HAVE OUTSIDE PLANS DOWN INTO THE 50S AND 40S AGAIN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. UPPER 60S FOR THE FOOTHILLS AS WELL, AND MID 60S FOR OUR NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS, WITH ANOTHER CHILLY NIGHT ON THE WAY TO START OFF OUR WEEKEND. AND SPEAKING OF WEEKEND, IT LOOKS JUST BEAUTIFUL. PLENTY AND PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. CHILLY MORNINGS WILL CONTINUE, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR FRIENDS IN THE NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS, BUT WE’RE GETTING A BIT WARMER THIS WEEKEND. STILL, SOME GORGEOUS WEATHER THOUGH, AND COMFORTABLE THANKS TO THAT LOW HUMIDITY. I EXPECT HIGHS TO BE IN THE UPPER 70S BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, SO A NICE WEEKEND TO GET OUTSIDE. IT’S THE LAST WEEKEND OF THE CAROLINA CLASSIC FAIR. GOT COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES HAPPENING TO. IT’S GOING TO BE A GREAT WEEKEND TO GET OUTSIDE, BUT OUR OUR TEMPERATURES KIND OF TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER RIDE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. WINDS SHIFT OUT OF THE SOUTH OVER THE WEEKEND, SO WE GET A BIT WARMER IN THE UPPER 70S. AND THEN ANOTHER FALL. STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY AND THAT REALLY BRINGS SOME COOLER AIR IN. I THINK TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY OUR HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO GET INTO THE LOW 60S. SO COOL. A COOL DOWN ON THE WAY EARLY NEXT WEEK, BUT FOR NOW WE’VE GOT A WARM WEEKEND RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. LOOKS BEAUTIFUL HERE IN THE TROPICS, MAINLY QUIET AS WELL. THERE’S A NEW TROPICAL WAVE COMING OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA THAT HAS ABOUT A MEDIUM CHANCE OF DEVELOPING SATELLITE DATA SHOWS THERE’S A BIT MORE WIND AND SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS WITH THIS SYSTEM. IT’S JUST AN AREA WE’RE WATCHING AGAIN. IT’S A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM INTERACTING WITH ANY LAND, SO IT’S NOT SOMETHING WE’RE CONCERNED ABOUT. IT WILL BE A LONG TIME BEFORE IT WOULD EVEN GET CLOSE TO US, AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT’S GOING TO STAY FAIRLY WEAK. IF IT DID BECOME A BRIEF TROPICAL STORM OVER THE OPEN WATERS OF THE ATLANTIC, IT WOULD BE NAMED NADINE. THAT’S THE NEXT STORM ON THE LIST AFTER OUR BUSY HURRICANE SEASON SO FAR. SO WE’VE GOT CHILLY MORNINGS THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, A BIT WARMER OVER THE WEEKEND WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ALMOST COMPLETELY DRY. SEVEN DAY FORECAST AND THAT\nAdvertisement\nWATCH: Mild Friday, warmer weekend ahead\nWarming up this weekend ahead of a big cool down next week\nMeteorologist Dylan Hudler has your Friday afternoon forecast.\nMeteorologist Dylan Hudler has your Friday afternoon forecast.\nAdvertisement",
