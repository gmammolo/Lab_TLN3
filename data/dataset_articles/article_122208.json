  "text": "A rare sight for southern Ontario, CBC reporters captured photos Thursday night’s brilliant light show in and around Toronto. Thursday night's brilliant light show was captured in photos by CBC reporters in and around Toronto CBC News · Posted: Oct 11, 2024 11:12 AM EDT | Last Updated: 4 hours ago The northern lights were visible in parts of southern Ontario Thursday night and Friday morning. The light show was caused by a geomagnetic storm. (Lane Harrison/CBC) Social Sharing Torontonians may be used to bright lights, but Thursday night was brighter — and prettier — than usual.\nDue to a geomagnetic storm, the northern lights were visible around Toronto and parts of southern Ontario late Thursday evening into Friday morning.\nIn Toronto, CBC's Nicole Mortillaro photographed the lights dancing above The Beaches in the city's east end Thursday night. The Balmy Beach Club is visible in the distance.\n(Nicole Mortillaro/CBC) Even above the downtown lights and the CN Tower, the red hue of the Aurora shone through.\n(Nicole Mortillaro/CBC) Over near the Scarborough Bluffs, CBC's Rozenn Nicolle got a shot of a bright green sky above the waters of Bluffers Park Marina.\n(Nicolle Rozenn/CBC) And further north, though not as far as one might expect, CBC Toronto's Lane Harrison caught an even more dazzling light show in Bracebridge, Ont., Thursday.",
