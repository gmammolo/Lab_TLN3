  "text": "If you’ve been seeing amazing [aurora borealis photos](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/05/upstate-ny-captivated-by-stunning-northern-lights-display-photos-videos.html) taken across Upstate New York and want to catch a glimpse yourself, you might get another chance tonight — or tomorrow. A severe geomagnetic storm alert has been issued for Oct. 10 and 11 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center. The daily aurora forecast is predicting there could be colorful skies across most of Upstate New York during the event. The NOAA says the possible G4 storm caused by a large solar flare could be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California tonight if the skies are clear. Tonight’s event is forecast to have a Kp index of 8 which means the aurora will move even further towards the equator and it will become very bright and very active. The NOAA reports these are the events that create the best aurora and the extended auroral oval will be observable by the most people. Residents in the [United Kingdom](https://x.com/physicsJ/status/1844457718310109652?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), near London, have already posted photos of aurora-filled skies to social media. New York has had several chances this year to see beautiful night rainbow skies including May, [August](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/08/awesome-aurora-see-epic-photos-of-northern-lights-in-upstate-ny.html), [September](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/2024/09/aurora-awestruck-northern-lights-dance-above-upstate-ny-photos-video.html) and earlier this [October](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/outdoors/2024/10/will-the-aurora-borealis-appear-above-upstate-ny-this-week-we-like-our-chances.html). Where is the best place to see the northern lights? Head into the darkness if you want the best chance to see the neon skies. Avoid as much light pollution as possible and find a clear view of the horizon facing north. Popular spots include dark sky territory like the [Adirondacks](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/adirondacks/) and clear horizons like Lake Ontario or [Northern New York](https://www.newyorkupstate.com/northern-ny/) bordering Lake Champlain. When will the northern lights appear? Predicting when and where the lights will be visible is not an easy task. The NOAA says the best aurora is usually within an hour or two of midnight, between 10 PM and 2 AM local time, but can appear any time after sunset or sunrise. For an updated aurora forecast, visit [NOAA’s website](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/communities/aurora-dashboard-experimental) or the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NWSSWPC) for the Space Weather Prediction Center. How can I photograph the northern lights? You don’t need an expensive camera to capture the auroras. [Visit Iceland](https://www.visiticeland.com/article/how-to-photograph-the-northern-lights-with-a-smartphone), a popular northern lights viewing destination, offers tips to capturing the event with your smartphone. They suggest putting your phone in night mode and adjusting the exposure time if possible to 10-15 seconds to fully capture the sky. A tripod is also helpful to keep your phone steady and your lens in focus. If the northern lights appear tonight, we would love to see your photos. Please send your captures to [features@nyup.com](mailto:features@nyup.com) and make sure to include your name and where the photos were taken.",
