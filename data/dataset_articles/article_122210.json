  "text": "Military bases in Florida were still assessing damage from Hurricane Milton Thursday, but it initially appeared they had avoided the wide-scale destruction feared as the storm approached this week.\nA recovery team was sent to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa -- home to U.S. Central Command -- to survey any damage and begin recovery efforts after the Sunshine State was hit with less-than-anticipated storm surge and flooding compared to Hurricane Helene, which tore through the state and devastated parts of the Southeast last month.\nBrig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon's top spokesperson, told reporters Thursday that \"it wasn't the worst-case scenario\" but added that the teams were just starting to analyze the extent of Hurricane Milton's Category 3 destruction after the storm made landfall south of Tampa Wednesday evening.\nRead Next: Here Is the 2025 Pay Raise for Disabled Veterans and Military Retirees\n\"In other words, there's some damage, but not extensive damage,\" Ryder said. \"But again, we need the time to be able to go in, have the teams make those assessments and come back with more detailed information.\"\nFlooding was far more significant in the state late last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a briefing Thursday morning. He said surges were as high as 10 feet during Milton and as high as 20 feet during Helene.",
