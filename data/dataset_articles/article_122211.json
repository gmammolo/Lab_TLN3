  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Some Central Texans saw a rare atmospheric phenomenon Thursday night. Parts of the state got a glimpse of the northern lights, as a strong geomagnetic storm produced good viewing across northern portions of the United States. While viewing the northern lights with the naked eye was primarily only possible north of Texas, some people were able to see the colorful skies through photographs. Longer exposure from photographs helps to view the northern lights because increased shutter speeds can \"freeze\" the movement of the aurora. For Austin and Central Texas, it was a close call, but parts of the area were able to see the lights through photographs low on the horizon. If you missed your chance to see the aurora borealis Thursday night, you might have another opportunity to see the lights again Friday. If you want to try capturing the phenomenon on camera, look north and use the long exposure feature on your phone. Here's what the sky looked like last night in parts of Central Texas:",
