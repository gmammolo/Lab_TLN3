This comet will be the [brightest comet of 2024](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/skywatching/whats-up-october-2024-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/), according to NASA, and here’s how to see it before it begins its journey to the edge of the solar system. A comet named [C/2023 A3](https://space.com/comet-tsuchinshan-atlas-brightening-perihelion-how-to-see) Tsuchinshan–ATLAS is making an 80,000-year orbit around the sun. Some have dubbed it the \"comet of the century\" because of how brightly it might shine in the night sky. When was the comet discovered? In January 2023, writes [Space.com](https://www.space.com/), astronomers at China's [Purple Mountain Observatory](https://web.astronomicalheritage.net/show-entity?identity=163&idsubentity=1) spotted an object hurtling through space they believed was an asteroid. Scientists a month later at the [Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System](https://atlas.fallingstar.com/) (ATLAS) discovered the object was actually a comet, one that hasn't been seen for tens of thousands of years. Article continues after gallery. Where did it come from? Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS (pronounced Choo-cheen-SHAHN) is believed to have come out of what astronomers call the [Oort Cloud](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/), which lies far beyond Pluto. NASA describes the Oort Cloud as a giant spherical shell of icy space debris that surrounds our solar system. It's home to many long-period comets. How to see the 'comet of the century' To begin, don't worry if the night is cloudy. Comet C/2023 A3 will be zooming in the sky throughout October, meaning you'll have several opportunities to witness it. For the best experience, you'll want to get away from bright city lights — the darker the skies, the better the view. Bring binoculars and maybe a comfy blanket to keep warm. What time will Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS appear? Morning or night? That depends on the date in October. Skywatchers in the United States can spot the comet early in the morning during the first few days of the month. Later, the schedule flips. Grab a pair of binoculars or a telescope with a wide-angle view and look East just above the horizon. Where to look to see the comet Finding comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS in the Northern Hemisphere isn't about looking \"up,\" experts say, so much as looking \"out.\" Starting in mid-October you'll want to be somewhere with a good view of the horizon, [according to the Planetary Society](https://www.planetary.org/articles/how-to-spot-comet-tsuchinshan-atlas), because the comet won't appear high in the sky. Just after sunset, look toward the west and find the constellation Virgo, the second largest constellation in the sky, and that's where Tsuchinshan-Atlas should appear. But for a really impressive show, astronomers say to wait until mid-October. How close will the comet get to Earth? Between Oct. 12-13, the comet will make its closest approach to Earth, coming to within a distance of roughly 44 million miles, [according to TheSkyLive.com](https://theskylive.com/c2023a3-info). While a comet's behavior can be tricky to predict, astronomers say Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS could become bright enough to spot with the naked eye. Need help finding stars, planets and constellations?
