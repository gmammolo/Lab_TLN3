  "text": "By Brody Wooddell ,\n1 hours ago\nTAMPA (BLOOM) – Hurricane Milton has left many Floridians without power, and for many residents, this may be their first time using a generator.\nWith a rapidly growing population and new residents who might be unfamiliar with hurricane preparedness, it’s important to understand how to use generators safely to avoid serious risks.\nWhether you’re a seasoned Floridian or facing your first major storm, these generator safety tips will help you stay safe and power through the outage.\nDeSantis helps Waffle House employees cook for first responders Using generators safely is crucial to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, electrical hazards, and other deadly risks.\nCarbon Monoxide: A Deadly Threat\nUS Consumer Product Safety Commission Generators can produce carbon monoxide (CO), an odorless, colorless gas that can be fatal. Protect yourself and your family by following these guidelines:\nRun your generator outdoors , at least 20 feet from your home, doors, and windows. Never use a generator in an enclosed area, such as a garage, shed, or basement—even if doors or windows are open. Install carbon monoxide detectors in your home. These devices can alert you to dangerous CO levels. Prevent Electrical Hazards\nImproper generator use can lead to electrocution or fire. Follow these tips to prevent electrical hazards:\nUse heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords to connect appliances. Make sure the cords are undamaged. Never plug a generator directly into a wall outlet—this can cause “backfeeding,” which is dangerous for utility workers repairing power lines. Hire a qualified electrician to install a transfer switch if you need to connect your generator to your home’s electrical system. Where to find gas in Tampa Bay after Hurricane Milton Handle Fuel Safely\nIncorrect fuel handling can cause fires or explosions. Follow these fuel safety tips:\nStore fuel in approved containers and keep it away from heat sources. Turn off the generator and let it cool before refueling to prevent fires. Consider Solar Generators\nLion Energy Solar Generator “Safari” Solar generators offer a cleaner, safer alternative to traditional gas-powered generators. Unlike gas generators, solar generators do not produce carbon monoxide and have fewer risks when used properly. Here are some benefits of using solar generators:\nNo Carbon Monoxide : Solar generators do not emit carbon monoxide, making them safer to use indoors compared to gas generators. Quiet Operation : Solar generators operate quietly, which is ideal for those who want a noise-free solution during power outages. Renewable Power Source : Solar generators use energy from the sun, which means you don’t have to worry about storing or handling fuel. Simply recharge the unit with solar panels during daylight hours. Low Maintenance : Solar generators have fewer moving parts compared to gas generators, reducing the need for maintenance and making them more reliable in the long term. When using a solar generator, ensure you place the solar panels in an area where they receive ample sunlight, and be mindful of power consumption to avoid draining the battery too quickly. Solar generators are a great option for powering essential appliances, electronics, and medical devices during an outage.\nOne great option is from Lion Energy . Their solar generator is ideal for Florida and our hurricanes.\nUsing a Portable Generator\nPortable generators are a flexible option for providing emergency power. Unlike home standby generators that are permanently wired and automatically turn on during an outage, portable generators can be easily transported and replaced as needed.\nPreparation Is Key\nIt’s essential to prepare in advance if you plan to use a portable generator. Buy a generator well before a storm hits to ensure it’s ready when you need it. Select a generator that meets your power requirements by estimating the power needs of your home. Check out our Portable Generator Buying Guide and How to Choose a Solar Generator for help finding the right generator and estimating power needs.\nFor gas-powered, propane, or dual-fuel generators, make sure you have an adequate supply of fuel on hand. Solar generators need time to charge, either through solar panels or a household power outlet. Some models can also function as wind generators and will require windy conditions for charging. Keep your solar generator charged and ready, and test any generator regularly to ensure it’s in proper working condition.\nSteps for Using a Portable Generator\nEstimate Your Power Needs : List the items you want to power with your portable generator, such as the refrigerator, lights, and important chargers. Check the wattage requirements for each device, including both running wattage and starting/surge wattage for larger appliances. Place the Portable Generator : For gasoline-, propane-, or natural-gas-powered generators, place the generator outdoors at least 20 feet away from your house on a flat, stable surface, with its exhaust venting away from windows and doors. During inclement weather, you may need a cover or shelter. Solar generators can often be used indoors since they do not emit CO, but always check the manual for specific placement instructions. Plug In the Emergency Generator : Use heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords designed for use with generators. For gas-powered generators, run the cords through a window or door to the unit set up outside, but do not connect them to the generator until it is running. For hard-wired appliances, such as a well pump or furnace, have an electrician install a power-transfer switch. Start the Generator : Before starting a gas-powered generator, ensure no cords are plugged into the unit and that the fuel tank is full. Turn the fuel valve and on/off switch to the “On” position, pull the choke handle to the “Choke” position, and press the start switch until the generator starts. Gradually move the choke handle to the “Run” position and let the motor run for a while before plugging items in. For solar generators, starting is typically as easy as pressing a button or flipping a switch. Plug In the Devices and Appliances : Check the manual for any specific procedures for connecting devices. Often, it is recommended to start with items that pull the most power, such as a refrigerator, and let it run for a while before connecting other items. Plug each device into an extension cord, then plug the cord into the generator housing. Solar models may allow direct connection of devices.
