  "text": "Montreal’s Thanksgiving forecast, something to be grateful for this weekend?\nPosted October 11, 2024 12:05 pm.\nLast Updated October 11, 2024 12:24 pm.\nMontrealers can add the long weekend to their list of things to be grateful for as they celebrate Thanksgiving on Monday, but will they add the weather forecast to it too?\nMaybe!\nTo end the work week, a high of 17 degrees is being felt — bringing a cool yet comfortable fall atmosphere to the city.\nLate this evening and overnight, you might find yourself falling asleep to raindrops on your windows — as there’s a 60 percent chance of showers.\nCome Saturday though, skies are set to clear in the morning.\nIt’ll be a high of 12 degrees according to Environment Canada, chillier yes, but a perfect time to wear your favourite cozy sweater while admiring the leaves changing colours.\nThis seasonable weather looks like it’ll continue into Sunday — sun and clouds forecasted with a high of 11 degrees.\nNow, rain will fall on Thanksgiving — but depending how you look at it, this could be added to your list of things to be grateful for.\nYou’ll most likely be indoors — away from the wet weather — while eating a grand meal alongside loved ones.\nAnd well, a least it isn’t snow.",
