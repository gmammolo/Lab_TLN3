  "text": "Hope After The Hurricanes: Join KSL to help aid victims Oct 11, 2024, 11:03 AM | Updated: 6:54 pm SALT LAKE CITY — KSL NewsRadio, through Bonneville International, is joining the effort to raise funds to support the American Red Cross in its efforts to profile critical relief for victims of the recent hurricanes. We are inviting you to join in our Hope After The Hurricanes initiative. The Red Cross is on the ground delivering food, shelter, and supplies to those who have been hardest hit, and they need our help to continue these lifesaving efforts. This is our opportunity to offer hope and help to families who’ve lost their homes and livelihoods after these devastating hurricanes. Together we can make a difference Every dollar counts, and your contribution, no matter how small, can provide meals, shelter, and medical assistance to those in urgent need. All proceeds go directly to the American Red Cross to aid its hurricane recovery efforts.
