  "text": "The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) predicted the unusual solar winds to spark a visible Aurora Australis on Friday and Saturday nights. Aussie stargazers will be treated to a dazzling light show over the next two nights after a massive solar burst.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) predicted the unusual solar winds to spark a visible Aurora Australis on Friday and Saturday nights.\nThe phenomena, also known as the Southern Lights, is caused by solar activity interacting with the Earth's magnetic field.\nIt is more active in locations with minimal light pollution such as rural beaches or a hill as far south as possible to be closer to the South Pole.\nBOM's Space Weather Forecasting Centre said that a 'coronal mass ejection' is expected to hit Earth by midnight on Friday.\n'Possibly resulting in significant geomagnetic activity and visible auroras during local nighttime hours,' the statement reads.\nThe centre will issue further alerts if 'significant geomagnetic activity actually occurs'.\nIt comes just months after the Southern Lights lit up skies from Tasmania to as far north to Mackay after a huge geomagnetic storm in May.\nAussie stargazers could soon be treated to a stunning display of aurora australis (pictured), or the Southern Lights, on Thursday, Friday and Saturday…\nFreddy Pawle",
