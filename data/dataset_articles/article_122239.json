WELL, I JUST NEED THE PUFFER JACKET. I MEAN, WELL, WE DO HAVE SOME COOLER WEATHER THAT’S GOING TO BE HERE. IT’S BEAUTIFUL. RIGHT NOW. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS GOING TO BE COMING THROUGH ON TUESDAY.

EVERYONE ELSE IN THE LOW 80S RIGHT NOW. 81 ON BEAUTIFUL GRAND ISLE. 81 OUR CURRENT TEMPERATURE IN GULFPORT. HERE ARE YOUR CURRENT CONDITIONS AT LOUIS ARMSTRONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 58 THE DEW POINT. THAT’S A GOOD DEW POINT. WINDS FROM THE EAST TO NORTHEAST AT ABOUT TEN MILES PER HOUR. A TOUCH ON THE BREEZY SIDE TODAY, ALTHOUGH THE WINDS AREN’T EXPECTED TO BE OVERLY STRONG. TAKE A LOOK AT THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. EXTREMELY DRY AIR IN PLACE AT THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE, AND THE FOLKS IN FLORIDA, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN SOME VERY DRY AIR MOVE IN ON THE BACKSIDE OF MILTON. SO PEOPLE THAT DON’T HAVE POWER IN FLORIDA. THANKFULLY, IT ISN’T OPPRESSIVELY HOT. THINGS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER AND DEW POINT TEMPERATURES THERE ARE IN THE LOW 60S, SO THEY’RE SEEING A SIMILAR WEATHER TO WHAT WE’RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IN THE TROPICS. NOTHING THAT YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS AREA OF CLOUDINESS. HURRICANE CENTER I’M SURE, IS WATCHING IT, BUT IT’S NOTHING OFFICIAL. WE ACTUALLY HAVE ONE TROPICAL WAVE THAT THE HURRICANE CENTER IS KEEPING THEIR EYES ON. 50% CHANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN HERE’S LESLIE. YOU ALREADY KNOW LESLIE ISN’T GOING TO BE A FACTOR FOR ANYONE. SO AS FAR AS WE’RE CONCERNED, WE CAN CALL THE TROPICS. QUIET. LET’S GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOU THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. TEMPERATURE WISE TONIGHT. GREAT EVENING FOR A WALK AROUND THE BLOCK AFTER DINNER, RIGHT AROUND 70 DEGREES. HERE WE ARE AT 8:00 IN THE EVENING. AS WE GO THROUGH THESE COMPUTER MODELS, IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR CLOUD COVER, YOU’RE NOT GOING TO FIND MUCH. FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING, WE’RE GOING TO BE IN THE 50S ON THE NORTH SHORE. ACTUALLY 50S, JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE. AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON, PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AGAIN. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD MAKE IT TO THE LOW AND MID 80S, BUT THE HUMIDITY STAYING VERY, VERY MANAGEABLE. AND EVEN THOUGH ON SUNDAY IT MAY BE JUST A TOUCH WARMER AND A TOUCH MORE HUMID, IT’S STILL GOING TO BE GREAT. WE’LL START IN THE 50S. SUNDAY MORNING, SUNDAY AFTERNOON 1 OR 2 DEGREES WARMER, MID TO UPPER 80S ON SUNDAY. BUT THEN AGAIN WE’RE GOING TO BE TRACKING THAT COOL FRONT THAT WILL BE MOVING THROUGH ON TUESDAY. AND THAT FRONT. I’LL WAIT TILL YOU SEE THE SEVEN DAY FORECAST HERE IN JUST A MINUTE. SUNNY SKIES. VERY NICE. NOT HUMID TODAY. HIGH TEMPERATURE IN THE LOW TO MID 80S. AND THEN TONIGHT. MOSTLY CLEAR, COOL AND COMFORTABLE. ALL RIGHT. LET’S LOOK AT THOSE MORNINGS. ONCE WE GET TO WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY. LOOK AT THAT. WE’RE IN THE 40S. FRIDAY IS GOING TO BE IN THE 40S AS WELL AT LEAST ON THE NORTH SHORE. SO THAT’S WHEN WE MAY ACTUALLY NEED A JACKET FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK AT YOUR\nAdvertisement\nComfortable weekend ahead, tracking another cold front\nWe have very dry air in place right now at the mid upper levels of the atmosphere, and with the dewpoint in the 50s and many locations, it will be very pleasant and comfortable through the weekend. Our next cold front will likely arrive on Tuesday, and it’s only going bring us a very small chance for rain. However, behind this front on Tuesday,, mornings will get down into the 40s on the North Shore, and afternoon highs will only be in the 70s for much of next week.
