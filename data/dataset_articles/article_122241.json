  "text": "Breathtaking northern lights seen across Ottawa. Here’s what it looked like Posted Oct 11, 2024 11:44:46 AM. Last Updated Oct 11, 2024 01:09:59 PM. A powerful geomagnetic storm caused the northern lights to dance across the nation’s capital on Oct. 10. This resulted in the breathtaking hues of the aurora borealis ending up all over social media. Amateur and professional photographers alike headed out into the crisp night air on Thursday to capture what many never thought they’d see before. The spectacle was seen across the province; as the pink, green and red lights lit up Ottawa communities. According to an [astronomer at Western University](https://kitchener.citynews.ca/2024/10/11/aurora-borealis-lights-up-night-sky-in-waterloo-region/), the increase in auroral activity is thanks to the sun’s natural cycle, which comes together in a period of increased activity about every 11 years. Experts note, the sun’s activity has increased in the past year and is higher than it’s been in more than 20 years.
