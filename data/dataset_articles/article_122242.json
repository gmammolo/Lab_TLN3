  "text": "Residents across Edinburgh were overjoyed when the Northern Lights covered the city on Thursday night. The phenomenon appeared over the capital, and much of Scotland, and it could be seen once again tonight (Friday) according to the Met Office. The aurora was visible from beauty spots like Calton Hill and Arthur's Seat . Strong red and green tones were seen in the skies above due to a rare 'solar storm' with the lights caused by activity on the surface of the sun - typically visible in the poles or surrounding areas. Advice from the Met Office said the best conditions to view the lights are when the sky is dark and clear of any clouds.

The Mirror has reported we might be in for another treat in the skies on Friday, though it is a bit less likely than Thursday. What causes the Northern Lights? The Met Office says: \"Northern lights occur as a consequence of solar activity and result from collisions of charged particles in the solar wind colliding with molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere. \"Solar winds are charged particles that stream away from the Sun at speeds of around 1 million miles per hour. When the magnetic polarity of the solar wind is opposite to the Earth's magnetic field, the two magnetic fields combine allowing these energetic particles to flow into the Earth's magnetic north and south poles.\" Sign up for Edinburgh Live newsletters for more headlines straight to your inbox Which weather conditions are best to see the lights? The best weather conditions to view the lights are when the sky is dark and clear of any clouds, according to the Met Office. \"Cloud cover blocks the view of the light. Ideally, the lights will be best viewed away from any light pollution, in remote areas, facing the northern horizon - north facing coasts produce some of the best viewing locations\", the weather experts said. The Northern Lights are most active during March and April and September and October. Will Brits be able to see the Northern Lights tonight? Brits wanting to see the Northern Lights tonight may have less of a chance compared to last night. The Met Office’s latest weather forecast reads: \"The chances of aurora remain initially, though gradually easing through October 11, becoming increasingly confined to far northern geomagnetic latitudes by October 13.\" The weather forecast added that we’ll see \"rain across Scotland and Northern Ireland becoming more widespread through the night, although far north clearer with the odd wintry shower.\" Join Edinburgh Live's Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. The Met Office Space Weather forecasting service said that last night was likely to be the most intensive display caused by a severe geomagnetic storm - but that it is having ‘ongoing effects’ into Friday. It said aurora would be seen on Friday and will gradually ease until Sunday - meaning there is a decent chance of another display later Although there could be some residual viewings possible over the weekend, however, this is likely to be confined to Scotland. The Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said Thursday night was the \"main focus in terms of any aurora visibility\".",
