  "text": "Dustin’s First Alert Forecast: A mostly sunny weekend with fall-like temperatures Cooler overnight lows next week As we end the work week and head into the weekend, we will be spoiled with mostly sunny skies and seasonable temperatures in the afternoon. Highs will be in the mid-70s and calm breeze from the northwest. Overnight lows will be on the chiller side as we will see mostly 40s inland and lower 50s along the coast. A light jacket or sweatshirt will be needed if you are heading to the Mumfest or other activities that are scheduled across ENC. As for our area beaches, watch for rip currents and larger swells, as they will be on the higher side. The start of next week will be nice and slightly warm, as temperatures will be in the upper 70s to near 80° in the afternoon. By the time Monday night approaches, cooler and chillier air dips from the north. A few showers will be possible, but not a slamdunk of a washout is forecasted. Highs Tuesday-midweek will hold in the lower 60s and overnight temperatures drop to the lower 40s, with a few outlining areas dipping in the upper 30s. While a hard freeze is not forecasted, patchy frost could be possible for some. Our average frost/freeze is usually late October and early November.
