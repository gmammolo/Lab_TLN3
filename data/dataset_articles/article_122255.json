  "text": "Hurricane Milton brought more than just rain to this thrilled Florida couple that found their missing wedding ring amid the mud and muck.\nNine years ago, Laura and Basil Yorio were in the middle of a construction project when Basil's ring \"just disappeared,\" Lauren told FOX 35.\nThe couple said they searched their yard in Palm Coast numerous times over the years but were never able to recoup their loss, nor did their weekly landscaper.\nIt wasn't until they returned home after evacuating ahead of Hurricane Milton that the couple struck silver, Fox 35 reported.\n\"I looked down and saw a silver ring and thought it was like a key ring,\" Laura said. Turns out, it was her husband's missing wedding ring.\nDespite the devastation surrounding them, the Yosios are grateful the hurricane's heavy rains brought them their good fortune.\n\"We're very mindful that a lot of people are going through terrible things, and I feel almost a little guilty feeling happy about all of this, but it was something good,\" she told FOX 35.\n© 2024 Latin Times.
