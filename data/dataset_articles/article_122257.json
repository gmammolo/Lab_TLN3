Be careful.” Afterwards, the teen was able to swim to the boat as two officers reached out and pulled him to safety.\nChronister recalled that the boy — who had been trying to walk back home, but misjudged how deep the water was — was “out of breath, gasping for air as we pulled him up.” Chronister went on to say that the area was not in an evacuation zone.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nThere were 350 calls for help between 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 9 and 3:30 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 10, the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue told WFLA-TV.\nAnderson Cooper Struck by Flying Debris from Hurricane Milton During Live News Report: 'That Wasn't Good' Hurricane Milton made landfall around Siesta Key, Fla., around 8:30 p.m. local time on Wednesday, Oct. 9, according to the National Hurricane Center .
