  "text": "As Hurricane Milton neared Florida's Gulf Coast, 22-year-old Kenzie Lewellen went into labour at 4 am on Wednesday in Port Charlotte. Lewellen and her boyfriend, Dewey Bennett, faced the difficult task of getting to a hospital while bracing for the approaching storm, as reported by NBC News .The storm hadn’t yet made landfall, but water was already seeping into their home when Lewellen’s contractions began. At 39 weeks pregnant, they knew they needed to act quickly, fearing that flooded roads would prevent them from reaching the hospital in time. “I just didn’t want to go through what I had to go through with the last hurricane back in 2017,” said Bennett, whose father had died after emergency services couldn’t reach him during the storm.While contemplating evacuation to West Palm Beach, which was hit by nine tornadoes, they decided to stay put. When Lewellen’s contractions intensified after 4.5 hours of labour at home, they went to Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Venice. “My mum was driving us, and it was extremely windy,” Lewellen said, adding that few cars were on the road due to the dangerous conditions.Once at the hospital, Lewellen's mother wasn’t allowed to stay with her due to hospital restrictions. “I was very upset that my mum couldn’t stay because she’s my best friend,” she said. They managed to stay connected via FaceTime throughout much of the labour.As the hurricane intensified, Lewellen watched from her hospital window as strong winds battered Sarasota. “I was telling him, ‘Oh, that tree looks like it’s going to fly out of the ground!’” she said. The tree eventually uprooted, heightening the tension of the night.Problems arose when doctors informed Lewellen that her baby was in the wrong position, requiring an emergency C-section. A failed epidural left her in severe pain until she was given anaesthesia. “I was very scared. If I didn’t have the doctors and nurses I had, it would’ve been a lot worse,” she said.At 11.45 pm, Dewey Lester Bennett IV was born, an 8-pound baby boy. Bennett said, “My cheeks hurt because I haven’t stopped smiling.”Despite the storm, Lewellen and Bennett were elated by their newborn’s safe arrival. Holding their son for the first time, Lewellen described it as “the most indescribable feeling.” Reflecting on the birth, she added with a smile, “He is a miracle baby.”",
