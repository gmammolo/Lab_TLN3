  "text": "A Maltese woman living in Florida experienced Hurricane Milton firsthand but, fortunately, was not severely affected by the natural disaster.\n“It was a nasty, frightening storm, but it has passed and we’re so grateful for that,” Jade Satariano, resident of Sarasota city, wrote on social media\nHurricane Milton has left a path of destruction across Florida killing 16 people and leaving around three million residents without power.\nMilton hit landfall Category 3 hurricane near Siesta Key, a barrier island connected by two bridges to Sarasota. It spawned dozens of tornadoes, 8.5 metre waves, strong winds, heavy rainfall, and a storm surge.\nMilton was forecasted to be the first major hurricane to hit Sarasota in more than 100 years. So, that’s exactly what residents there prepared for. Thankfully, the storm was not catastrophic in the area and Jade was marked safe.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Lovin Malta (@lovinmalta)\nJade sent footage to Lovin Malta of the storm’s aftermath near her home. Trees were uprooted, rain puddles were left and the roof of the barn her horses stayed at broke off. But fortunately, that was the worst of the damage for Jade.\n“Hurricane Milton reminded us that while we can’t control nature, we can control how prepared we are. Grateful for our safety, our animals safety, and for Governor DeSantis’ efforts to keep our state as safe as possible,” Jade told the newsroom earlier today.\n“We’re incredibly grateful for the minimal damage to our homes and for the barns that held strong, keeping our sweet animals safe,” her post continued.\nSatariano and her partner decided not to evacuate their home. Trusting that the house was “boarded up and sturdy” and preparing with food, water and supplies, they decided to stay put. However, they did decide to leave their horses at a barn.\nWaking up after a long and stressful night, Jade posted a heartwarming photo embracing her horse and writing “the very tired and disheveled face of a girl who got to hug her horse after Milton this morning”.\nAll wind and storm surge warnings for Milton have been discontinued after the hurricane exited Florida’s east coast. The National Hurricane Center warned that “hazards remain” from damaged buildings, downed power lines and floodwaters.\nLovin Malta’s thoughts are extended to all those devastated by the storm",
