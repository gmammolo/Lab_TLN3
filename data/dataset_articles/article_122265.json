  "text": "The northern lights may be visible in New Hampshire Thursday night, following a geomagnetic storm triggered by a powerful solar flare. An X-class flare launched a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the sun on Tuesday, hitting Earth Thursday and causing the geomagnetic storm to fluctuate from moderate G2 to severe G4 levels. Auroras have already been seen across parts of Europe, including Switzerland, Italy, and Scotland. New Hampshire stargazers could catch a glimpse of the northern lights if weather conditions cooperate. Partly cloudy skies are expected in central and southern parts of the state, while cloud cover may linger over the mountains and North Country. The ideal viewing time for the aurora typically falls between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., depending on atmospheric conditions. For the best experience, find an open area away from city lights, ideally looking north, low on the horizon. Cameras can enhance visibility, as most cellphone cameras capture more light than the human eye, sometimes revealing colors not visible unaided. Adjusting your camera’s shutter speed to a slower setting can also improve image clarity, as the aurora’s visibility depends on factors such as aurora strength, weather, and location. Though the northern lights can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, camera assistance can enhance the experience. Those planning to venture out are advised to prepare for weather changes and to monitor aurora forecasts, as the phenomenon’s visibility may fluctuate. The aurora is predicted to arrive on Earth between Thursday morning and mid-afternoon, according to officials, but they won't be able to pinpoint the ideal moment to see it until the storm approaches the planet. One million miles from Earth, a satellite operated by NOAA is capable of identifying when a solar storm is approaching the globe. Within fifteen to thirty minutes after the spacecraft detects it, auroras are predicted to be visible over Earth. When officials get additional details regarding the date, NOAA said that they would post a notice on their website.
