  "text": "The National Park Service (NPS) announced that the Blue Ridge Parkway from milepost 0 to 198 in Virginia reopens today. After initially closing due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, the reopened section returns access to multiple scenic overlooks and other visitor favorites such as Peaks of Otter, Roanoke County’s Explore Park, Rocky Knob, and Mabry Mill.\n“We are extremely thankful that much of the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia has reopened to the public following Hurricane Helene,” Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge, stated in a press release. “Virginia’s Blue Ridge region (the Cities of Roanoke & Salem and the Counties of Botetourt, Franklin, and Roanoke) was fortunate to have sustained minimal damage during the storm and our hearts go out to our neighbors who are still cleaning up from Helene.”\nNPS reports that the Humpback Rocks, James River, and Peaks of Otter visitor centers have also reopened today following the restoration of water and power. While trail assessments are ongoing, officials advise hikers to exercise caution until all areas are fully evaluated. The NPS aims to reopen the remainder of Virginia’s section of the parkway within the next two weeks.\n“Due to the hard work of the Blue Ridge Parkway crews, we are able to open nearly 200 miles of the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia, a vital and scenic route that both embodies the natural beauty and cultural heritage of our region and plays a vital role in the local economy through tourism and community engagement,” Tracy Swartout, superintendent of the Blue Ridge Parkway, stated in a press release. “While we celebrate this achievement, we also recognize that significant and, in some areas, long-term work remains in North Carolina. We are committed to restoring all sections of the parkway to the highest standards of safety and accessibility for our visitors.”\nThe entire portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina remains closed as crews are still conducting emergency stabilization and damage assessment.
