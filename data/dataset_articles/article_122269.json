Temperatures remain slightly below-average Friday afternoon, with highs in the upper 70s to low 80s. The sky remains near-cloudless due low humidity. Friday night looks clear and cool again, with temperatures gradually falling to near 50° by sunrise Saturday.\nSunshine fills the sky this weekend. The sky may remain cloudless or close to Saturday and Sunday. Saturday’s temperatures look similar to Friday’s, with highs in the low 80s. Saturday night lows fall to near 50°. Sunday looks warmer, with highs in the mid to upper 80s. Sunday night also looks warmer, with lows closer to 60°.\nNext week begins warm, with highs in the mid 80s Monday.
