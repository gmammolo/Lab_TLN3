  "text": "By Juliana Kim | NPR ,\n3 hours ago\nThe northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are seen in the sky across Whitby Harbour, Whitby, UK, on Oct. 10. (Alfie Cosgrove) On Thursday, the northern lights — also known as the aurora borealis — illuminated vast expanses of Europe and the United States.\nThe rare and fleeting appearance brought many to a standstill, evoking a moment of awe and wonder in seasoned aurora chasers and novice stargazers alike.\nSome kept their eyes peeled all night at the evening sky. While others were delightfully surprised by the sudden splashes of red, green and purple hues shimmering above them.\nThe dazzling display of color was the result of a powerful solar storm that slammed into Earth. People typically travel to Alaska, Iceland and other regions within the Arctic Circle to witness the celestial phenomenon. But the geomagnetic storm triggered the aurora to light up night skies father out. It's the second time a severe solar storm crashed into Earth this year, the first being in May .\nThe light show was expected to be visible as far south as Alabama and northern California, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But some reported seeing the aurora as far south as Texas, Arizona, as well as in Australia.\nAnd sky-watchers who missed the show may have another chance to see the lights — experts say they could pop out again during the weekend.\nThe Milky Way and northern lights are seen together as the aurora makes a rare appearance in the early morning hours of Oct. 8, southwest of Mammoth Lakes, California.

(Jonah Lawless) An aurora borealis makes an appearance over pumpjacks as they draw out oil and gas from well heads near Cremona, Alberta, Canada, on Oct. 10. (Jeff McIntosh) The northern lights, produced by a solar geomagnetic storm, are seen from Shenandoah National Park in Rileyville, Virginia, on Oct. 10. (Saul Loeb) Auroras are seen in Sugarloaf Key, Florida, in the early morning hours of Oct. 11. (Jen Golbeck) An aurora borealis is seen from the Pujalt astronomical observatory on Oct. 10 in Pujalt, Barcelona, Spain. (Lorena Sopêna) The night sky in Wisconsin glows with the northern lights as a geomagnetic storm brings vibrant pink and green colors to a majority of the northern states, and beyond. (Ross Harried) Northern lights shine in the night sky above Trakai castle, about 18 miles from Vilnius, Lithuania, on Oct. 10. (Yauhen Yerchak) Northern lights on display in the skies over Great Chart Church, Ashford, Kent, England, on Oct. 10.
