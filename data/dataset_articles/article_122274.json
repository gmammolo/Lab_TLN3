Clear and calm nights will allow for chilly temperatures for the morning hours, coldest in the mountains, but afternoon sunshine will warm us back into the upper 70s on Saturday. We’ll even reach the low 80s on Sunday in Charlotte. Another cold front then approaches our area, bringing breezy conditions and much colder temperatures our way by the start of next week.
