(Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\nAfter a previous light show on Monday , the aurora borealis returned to the sky overnight, putting on a dazzling show for many people across Saskatchewan.\nThe swirling lights were clearly visible in Saskatoon, despite the light pollution that often makes the phenomenon difficult to view from densely populated areas.\nThe lights could be seen in Saskatoon on Thursday despite the local light pollution. (Peter Frederiksen/Submitted)\nThe skies over the Bridge City were filled with dancing bands of green, red, pink and purple, which were captured on film by a number of local photographers.\nThe skies putting on a show, and we have front row seats 🌌✨ @CKOMNews @CJMENews #yxe #saskatoon #LandOfLivingSkies pic.twitter.com/0Gfk3WdoLn\n— Alex Brown (@AlexBrownYXE) October 11, 2024\nDr. Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen, who took a number of snaps of the aurora this week , said watching the northern lights was a fantastic experience.\nDr. Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen said it was a fantastic experience to watch the colours dancing in the night sky. (Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\n“As I stood under the vast expanse of the sky, I was struck by the ethereal quality of the lights. They shimmered and danced, evoking a profound sense of awe and tranquility,” Yaseen said.\nThe northern lights were even brighter outside of the city near Clavet. (Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\n“This display was not merely a visual feast; it served as a poignant reminder of the beauty and power of nature. The experience left me feeling deeply connected to the universe, as if I was witnessing a cosmic ballet.”\nNorthern Lights so strong tonight you can see them over downtown Saskatoon. @CKOMNews #YXE pic.twitter.com/WxHuwVfSLg\n— Shane (@ShaneC06) October 11, 2024\n(Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\nAccording to the Canadian Space Agency, the northern lights, or aurora borealis, are caused when the Sun shoots charged electrons and protons out into space in a phenomenon called solar wind.\nBands of pink and green took over the night sky on Thursday. (Gerald Bauman/650 CKOM)\nThe Earth’s magnetic field then launches those charged particles down towards the planet’s surface along the magnetic field lines. Northern lights occur when these charged particles launched along Earth’s magnetic field collide with gases in the upper atmosphere. Those collisions produce tiny flashes of light that fill the sky with colours.\nThe northern lights lit up the sky in the Saskatoon area like fireworks. (Shaden Rislan Bani Yaseen/Submitted)\nThe northern lights were visible over the University of Saskatchewan campus on Thursday. (Devan Mescall/Submitted)\nThis light works the same way as a neon lamp or an old cathode ray tube television set. As billions of flashes occur in sequence, the aurora appears to move or dance in the sky.\n(Vicky Parohl/Submitted)\nSend us your stories, photos and video Did see the northern lights in your area?
