  "text": "Photo: Noppawat Tom Charoensinphon / Moment / Getty Images\nJacksonville, FL - Following the passage of Hurricane Milton, residents on Jacksonville's Northside were treated to a rare and stunning spectacle as the Northern Lights were visible in the region for the first time since 1989.\nThe appearance of the Northern Lights was due to a severe geomagnetic storm caused by a recent solar outburst.\nGeomagnetic storms are disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a sudden release of energy from the sun.\nThese disturbances can disrupt power grids, satellite communications, and other technologies.\nThey are often associated with solar flares, which are intense bursts of radiation from the sun's surface.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has notified operators of power plants and spacecraft to take precautions and alerted FEMA about potential power disruptions.\nX (formerly Twitter) user @WeatherGarrett Tweeted \"I’ve got the #aurora in Tallahassee, Florida!!\"\nWhile the current solar storm is not expected to surpass the record-breaking one in May, its impact remains uncertain until it gets closer to Earth.\nThe solar storm is just 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away from Earth.\nScientist Rob Steenburgh, of NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, tells Florida Coast News that Florida's southern location offers some protection from potential power disruptions, as the state is far enough south to avoid any power disruptions from the solar surge unless the solar surge gets a lot bigger",
