The Escarpment spans over 30 kilometres, dividing and Canadian Shield and the St. Lawrence Lowlands. Visitors can enjoy views of the valley and fall colours on this trail that features ten lookouts. Trail updates and closures in Gatineau Park The National Capital Commission (NCC) has outlined trail closures this fall, due to the Aug. 9 rainstorm that damaged trails and roads in Gatineau Park. Closures are related to work being done to repair affected areas. Gatineau Park trail closures, according to the NCC: - Trail closures include Trails #1 (from Penguin picnic area to #30), #3, #4, #36 (from Meech Lake Road to Fortune Lake Parkway), #51 (west of Philippe Lake Parkway), #52 (from #57 to #50), #55 and Dunlop Trail. The Dunlop parking lot is also closed. - The Penguin Picnic Area parking lot will be closed from October 15 to November 15, 2024, to repair damages to Trail 1. The picnic area will remain open. ( [Closure Advisory).](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/closures/full-closure-of-the-penguin-picnic-area-parking-lot) - Trail 62 (Wolf Trail) and Trail 38 will be partially closed from October 11 to 21, 2024, as part of Gatineau Park’s Responsible Trail Management project. During the partial closure, you will not be able to complete the loop on Trail 62 (Wolf Trail). - On October 21st, there will be a full closure of Trail 62 (Wolf Trail) and Trail 38, until the winter season is launched in Gatineau Park. - Parking lot 13a will also be closing from October 21st, until the middle of November.

Getting to and from Gatineau Park in October NCC is offering a free shuttle service to Gatineau Park six days a week (Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday to Sunday) until Oct. 27.

On weekdays, transportation is available from the Visitor Centre to Pink Lake only — entering and exiting the parkways three times a day via the Visitor Centre. Additionally, the NCC has partnered with [Transcollines](https://transcollines.ca/en/) to offer free rides on weekends and holiday Mondays to Meech Creek Valley and Philippe Lake, until Oct. 27. “It is a great way to explore lesser-known and quieter areas of Gatineau Park,” wrote the NCC.",
