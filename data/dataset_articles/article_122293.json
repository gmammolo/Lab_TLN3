  "text": "The Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia reopened Friday, two weeks after remnants of Hurricane Helene caused disastrous flooding in the Appalachian region. The parkway is now open from milepost 0 to milepost 198 in Virginia, which includes scenic views of Shenandoah National Park. “We are extremely thankful that much of the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia has reopened to the public following Hurricane Helene,” said Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia’s Blue Ridge. Howard noted that Roanoke, Salem and other nearby localities saw minimal storm damage. Fall foliage is anticipated to peak at the end of October, and Roanoke is an ideal place for those looking to explore the area, according to a release from Virginia’s Blue Ridge. The North Carolina stretch of the Blue Ridge Parkway remains closed. Crews continue emergency work to stabilize the road as they assess the damage. Hurricane Helene’s death toll has surpassed 200, making it the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Communities in western North Carolina are still reeling from damaged homes, washed-out river banks, knocked-out power and impassable roads. Additional updates on the Blue Ridge Parkway can be found here. Hannah Eason, hannah.eason@virginiamedia.com",
