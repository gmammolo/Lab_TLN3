  "text": "Great fall weather rolls on into the weekend Enjoy the warmth as some changes are not far off It’s been a perfect week of weather across Central and Eastern Kentucky capped off by a tremendous Friday. After quite the chilly start this morning with temperatures in the low 40s, bright sunshine was the rule once again as afternoon highs climbed back into the mid-70s. This amazing October weather pattern is going to stick around for the upcoming weekend but some changes are right around the corner. One advantage of the clear skies was great viewing for the Northern Lights Late Thursday as a strong geomagnetic storm allowed for much of the lower 48 to catch a peek. Saturday looks like a fantastic day from start to finish with plenty of sunshine expected along with unseasonably warm temperatures. Afternoon highs should climb into the upper 70s so it will be a perfect day for outdoor activities. If you are doing the Keeneland-Kentucky football daily double, Mother Nature couldn’t have lined things up any better. Make sure and take the sunscreen along if you are headed to the track or outside for any length of time with all the sunshine expected. Temperatures will drop off nicely into the evening hours so you may want to take along a jacket or a pullover if you are heading to Kroger Field for Kentucky and Vanderbilt on Saturday evening. It should be a nearly perfect night for football. A frontal boundary will be stretched out across the Ohio Valley for the second half of the weekend and will eventually drop through the commonwealth. The front will be lacking much moisture to work with but there may be enough to squeeze out a shower or a thunderstorm late in the day but more so possible into Sunday night. Winds will pick up out of the southwest and be gusty at times, driving afternoon highs to near the 80 degree mark. This front will be the leading edge of a much cooler air-mass so it will definitely feel like fall into early next week with some legitimate frost potential in play. With scattered clouds and a chilly northwest breeze in place, Monday will definitely be a chilly day as temperatures struggle to get out of the 50s for afternoon highs. Some upper level energy will rotate through the region keeping the wind up and some clouds around so that may limit the frost potential Monday night and possibly squeeze out a few isolated showers/sprinkles Monday and Tuesday. Unseasonably cool air will hang tough for Tuesday with highs in the mid-50s and a mix of clouds and sunshine so plan on dressing accordingly. Our best chance for frost will be Tuesday night as winds lighten up and skies clear a bit. Temperatures may drop into the low to mid-30s so that will increase the frost potential area-wide. Quiet weather will stay in place into the middle of next week as temperatures begin to moderate with highs climbing back through the 60s. ABC 36 HOUR FORECAST FRIDAY NIGHT: Clear skies and pleasant. Lows in the upper-40s. SATURDAY: Lots of sunshine, very nice. Highs in the upper-70s to around 80. SATURDAY NIGHT: Fair skies and mild. Lows in the upper-50s FRIDAY NIGHT: Clear skies and pleasant. Lows in the upper-40s. SATURDAY: Lots of sunshine, very nice. Highs in the upper-70s to around 80. SATURDAY NIGHT: Fair skies and mild. Lows in the upper-50s",
