  "text": "The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man who rode out Hurricane Milton by clinging to a cooler in the Gulf of Mexico, officials announced on Oct. 10. According to a release, a Coast Guard Air Station Miami helicopter crew rescued the man on Oct. 10. He was found about 30 miles off Longboat Key following the hurricane. He was wearing a life jacket. Man rescued after being found clinging to a cooler. U.S. Coast Guard via YouTube U.S. Coast Guard officials say the unidentified man is the captain of a fishing vessel named Capt. Dave. He was actually rescued twice this week — the first time was on Monday before the hurricane made landfall. At the time, the captain and a crew member were stuck on the disabled ship about 20 miles from the shore. The two were rescued by helicopter at the time, the Coast Guard said, and brought back in good condition. \"The vessel was left adrift and salvage arrangements were to be made,\" the Coast Guard release reads. Then, around noon on Wednesday before Hurricane Milton made landfall, the owner of the fishing boat reported to the Coast Guard that the captain had gone back out to the boat to make repairs at about 3 a.m. and hadn't checked in. The Coast Guard was able to make radio contact with the captain, the release says, and he reported that \"the rudder was fouled with a line and became disabled during his transit back to port.\" The weather conditions were \"quickly deteriorating\" as the hurricane approached, so the Coast Guard told the captain to put on a life jacket and say with his boat's \"emergency position indicating radio beacon.\" Around 6:45 p.m. Wednesday — as Milton was making landfall — the Coast Guard lost contact with the captain. The captain was rescued from the water at approximately 1:30 p.m. on Thursday, officials said — 17 hours after Milton’s landfall. In a video discussing the rescue , Lt. Landon Klopfenstein said they spotted the captain in the water after searching the last known location of his beacon. \"It looked like just a big object — a silhouette — as we were approaching,\" Klopfenstein said. \"As we got closer, we saw (his) arms reach up in the air and realized at the moment that we'd found the survivor floating — clinging — to a big fishing cooler. \" Klopfenstein and Lt. Ian Logan took the captain to Tampa General Hospital. \"We couldn't believe it, honestly, that he was OK,\" Klopfenstein said. \"Great story of perseverance, crew going with their gut and staying out there and ending with a success story — a miracle.\" In the release, Lt. Cmdr. Dana Grady — St. Petersburg’s command center chief — said the boat captain \"survived in a nightmare scenario for even the most experienced mariner.\" \"To understand the severity of the hurricane conditions, we estimate he experienced approximately 75-90 mph winds, 20-25 foot seas, for an extended period of time to include overnight. He survived because of a life jacket, his emergency position indicating locator beacon, and a cooler,\" Grady said. There is no official word yet on his condition.\nSamantha Kubota Sam Kubota is a senior digital editor and journalist for TODAY Digital based in Los Angeles. She joined NBC News in 2019.",
