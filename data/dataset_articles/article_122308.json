  "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – The Friday evening forecast is fantastic! As is the weekend and week ahead.\nGusty conditions will continue through sunset tonight, but we’ll stay dry. Temperatures will drop into the upper 40s for parts of Ware and Pierce counties in Southeast Georgia, while upper 50s and low-to-mid 60s round out the rest of Southeast Georgia and Northeast Florida. Slightly warmer along the Duval beaches.\nThere could be some light showers overnight along the St. Johns County coast, but otherwise a nice dry, cooler weekend ahead. Partly cloudy skies on Saturday with highs in the mid-to-upper 70s!\nA Coastal Flood Warning continues through 6 p.m. Saturday along the St. Johns River, especially around high tide where there could be localized flooding. High rip current rip at the St. Johns and Duval beaches through Saturday evening, high surf advisory through 5 a.m. Saturday.\nThe week ahead has no rain in the forecast, a warm-up on Tuesday before a cold front drops high temperatures into the upper 60s.\nCopyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",
