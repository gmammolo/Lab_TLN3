  "text": "Off the chilliest lows of the season, we ended up with a winner of a Friday. Morning temperatures ranged from the mid-30s to mid-40s across a big chunk of the region. Even the regional hot spot at National Airport dipped to a fall low of 48. Afternoon highs in the mid-60s to around 70 were also a touch cooler than typical. Temperatures warm a good deal this weekend. Listen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options Through Tonight: Mainly clear skies last through the night. It won’t be quite as chilly as last night. Still on the cool side. Most locations dip into the 40s. More like near 50 downtown. View the current weather at The Washington Post. Tomorrow (Saturday): Another day filled with tons of sun. We might see somewhat increased clouds by afternoon. Highs should mainly make it to a mid-70s to near 80 zone during the afternoon. Winds blow out of the northwest around five to 10 mph. Sunday: Mostly to partly sunny ahead of the next cold front. Perhaps a touch warmer than Saturday, with afternoon readings mainly in the upper 70s to low 80s locally. Winds blow from the south and southwest around 10 mph. See Camden Walker’s forecast through the beginning of next week . And if you haven’t already, join us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram . Fall foliage: It will be another fine weekend for regional leaf peeping, albeit on the warm side for mid-October. Most spots are seeing at least a little color locally, with conditions somewhat hit-or-miss given the stressful summer that trees went through amid dryness and heat. Moderate color is into the Interstate 81 corridor, per foliage tracking website Explore Fall . All but the highest elevations of West Virginia and western Maryland are still around high color or peak color this weekend. High spots in the Alleghenies are moving deeper past peak. It should be mostly sunny Saturday and Sunday. 60s to low 70s, except for the highest elevations of the mountains. Mainly 70s to near 80 in the local area and the Shenandoah Valley region.",
