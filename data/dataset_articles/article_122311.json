  "text": "The northern lights were amazing last night over Michigan. The experts at forecasting northern lights say they are again possible.\nThe wording from NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) is not as confident on strong northern lights tonight. They do say we will likely have northern lights, but give the various levels of northern lights a lesser chance than last night.\nAt 2:30 p.m. today SWPC said, “A G3 (Strong) geomagnetic storm watch remains in effect for 11 Oct as CME effects continue to diminish. A G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm watch is in place for 12 Oct due to lingering CME influences in addition to the possibility of relatively weak coronal hole high speed stream effects.”\nIn other words we should attempt again tonight to watch for northern lights. The Kp Index is usually a good way to tell how expansive the northern lights will be on a given night. Last night the Kp Index shot up to a very high Kp=9.\nHere is the current Kp Index forecast for today through Sunday night.\nThe Kp Index for tonight is in the bottom left column of numbers and the top numbers in the center column. Notice SWPC shows the Kp Index lowering through the night. the Kp Index for tonight is expected to start at Kp=6.0 and drop to Kp=5.33 during the middle of the night. This would imply the best chance to see northern lights will be late this evening.\nThe sky will be clear enough to see the northern lights for most of Michigan. There is a thicker patch of clouds across northern Lower Michigan as of 4:00 p.m. Those clouds will drift south and may stretch across central Lower late this evening. As the clouds drift into central Lower Michigan they will clear out of northern Lower Michigan. So some of us may have clouds that would obscure northern lights.\nGenerally it is thought we will have northern lights again tonight, but not to the extent of last night.\nGood luck.\nYou can see many great images from last night on our [Michigan Weather Facebook Group].",
