  "text": "Pedro Cáceres has gone viral after a photo of his house strapped down to withstand Hurricane Milton, which hit Florida starting October 9th, was posted on X. Cáceres and his daughter Raisa explained in an interview with a local station that there was a thought process behind the way the roof was strapped down. They’ve sadly been through this before.\nThe straps are connected to hooks, which are attached to 8-foot-deep holes that are filled with cement, which means the straps support thousands of pounds each. The man, who was born in Puerto Rico, said in an interview that the hurricanes he experienced on the island served as experience. He previously did the same thing in 2004 for Hurricane Charlie.\nLa foto viral de una casa en Orlando amarrada por el paso del Huracán Milton, es propiedad del puertorriqueño Pedro Càceres.\nEl boricua y su hija Raisa explicaron que los ganchos están agarrados a unos hoyos de 8 pies de profundidad rellenos de cemento y que las correas soportan… pic.twitter.com/qJ5DHr4Hlv\n— Molusco (@Moluskein) October 10, 2024\n“We had a hurricane that we went through,” his daughter Raisa told CNN. “And the back of our roof lifted a little bit, it was aluminum.” So the idea of strapping down the roof was born.\n“They hold about 5,400 pounds of weight and wind, so we’re giving it a test,” Raisa added.\nWith Milton now having moved past Orlando, the question is, did it work? And the answer seems to be a resounding yes. There are no pictures of the house in the aftermath as of yet, but an update from a social media account that seems to be from Cáceres indicates the straps kept the roof from sustaining any major damage because of Milton.\nUpdate – The straps worked #Milton #HurricaneMilton #Florida pic.twitter.com/4nqBjL0i8g\n— Gary FrostGermanotta (@frostygary) October 10, 2024\nWhoever said unconventional thinking couldn’t save the day?\nTo learn how to provide aid for those affected by Hurricane Milton, learn more here .",
