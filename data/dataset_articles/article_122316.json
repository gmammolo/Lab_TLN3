The Northern Lights graced night skies across Wisconsin including across Outagamie County on Thursday night after an eruption of solar material caused the NOAA Space Weather Prediction to issue a severe geomagnetic storm watch .\nWatches at this level are very rare. Strong geomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operation, NOAA says.\nThe watch continues into early Saturday morning, so if you missed the Aurora Borealis last night, you still may be able to see them tonight.\nIf you can't catch the Northern Lights either night, check out these pictures that Appleton and other Outagamie County residents took last night.\nNorthern lights over Appleton, WI. Never in my life have you been able to see them this vibrant in town with the naked eye.\nPosted by Michael Welhouse on Thursday, October 10, 2024 Northern lights over Appleton tonight are awesome\nPosted by Ricky Lucy on Thursday, October 10, 2024 Northern lights came out very bright just north of Appleton for a bit. So cool could see them very good with the naked eye. Some of my pics aren't focused the best my camera was a acting up a bit tonight.\nPosted by Austin Kealey on Thursday, October 10, 2024 My view of the Northern Lights. 🌙💜 #natureisawesome #magic #northernlights #mybackyard\nPosted by Ashley Schmit on Thursday, October 10, 2024 ✨Northern Lights✨ Appleton Wi. #northernlights #appletonwisconsin\nPosted by Fatima Marinez Martinez on Thursday, October 10, 2024 Northern lights Appleton, Wisconsin\nPosted by John Jacob on Thursday, October 10, 2024 For the first time in my life I saw the Northern Lights last night. 🌌 Absolutely incredible!\nPosted by The Statement Piece LLC on Friday, October 11, 2024 Northern lights #northernlights lights\nPosted by Patrick Roeland on Thursday, October 10, 2024 The Northern lights were beautiful over the farm tonight!\nPosted by Legacy Rose Farm on Thursday, October 10, 2024 What causes the Northern Lights? Also known as Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights are a natural light display in Earth's sky that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres.\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen , causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\nAs Auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\nWhen Northern Lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\nAre the Northern Lights becoming more common? This isn't the first time this year people throughout Wisconsin caught a glimpse of the Northern Lights. In May, a powerful geomagnetic storm unleashed spectacular views of the northern lights in areas of the U.S. where Auroras are seldom visible.\nAs the sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter Northern-Light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity.\nBest places in Wisconsin to see the Northern Lights In case you want to see the lights from somewhere that isn't your porch, here are a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky:\nNewport State Park , Ellison Bay Driftless Region, Wisconsin Harrington Beach State Park , Belgium Kettle Moraine State Forest , Eagle Kohler-Andrae State Park , Sheboygan Parnell Tower , Plymouth Rashad Alexander can be contacted at ralexander@gannett.com and 920-431-8214.
