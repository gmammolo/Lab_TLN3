  "text": "In a recent news conference, Governor Ron DeSantis announced Florida avoided a devastating “worst-case scenario” as Hurricane Milton weakened before making landfall. Though the storm caused significant damage and left millions without power, the state was spared from the catastrophic impact it initially feared Hurricane Milton struck the Florida coast Wednesday evening as a Category 3 storm, a major hurricane but far less severe than the Category 4 or 5 that had been forecast earlier in its path. The storm made landfall near Siesta Key, about 70 miles south of Tampa, avoiding a direct hit on the heavily populated Tampa Bay area. Despite the hurricane’s weakening, Florida still experienced substantial destruction. The storm claimed at least 10 lives, knocked out electricity for over 3 million residents, and tore the roof off Tropicana Field, home to the Tampa Bay Rays. Flooding and wind damage were reported across the state, and recovery efforts will take time. Speaking at a press conference Thursday morning, DeSantis expressed relief that the storm wasn’t as devastating as it could have been. “The storm was significant, but thankfully, this was not the worst-case scenario,” he said. “The storm did weaken before landfall, and the storm surge, as initially reported, has not been as significant overall as what we saw with Hurricane Helene.” Hurricane Helene, which hit Florida just two weeks prior, caused widespread destruction, especially in the panhandle and surrounding areas. “Helene produced a major surge all across the west coast of Florida and the Big Bend area,” DeSantis said, describing its impact as “biblical.” By contrast, Milton’s storm surge was much lower, particularly north of the landfall zone. While Milton’s weakening brought relief, DeSantis reminded Floridians that the damage was still extensive. “We have much destruction and damage to deal with,” he said, noting that recovery would be a long process. Portions of the state received up to 18 inches of rain, and more than 6,500 National Guard personnel have been deployed to assist in relief efforts. Before Hurricane Milton made landfall, several Christian leaders had urged people of faith to pray for the storm to weaken. Evangelist Franklin Graham of Samaritan’s Purse and Bryant Wright of Send Relief, among others, called on Christians to seek God’s protection for the state. In hindsight, many Floridians see Milton’s reduction in strength as an answer to those prayers. The power of prayer has long been a source of comfort for those facing natural disasters, and this storm was no exception. Governor DeSantis acknowledged the faith community’s resilience and contributions during difficult times. “People of faith have always played an important role in these moments,” he said, thanking churches and organizations for their ongoing support of recovery efforts. As Florida begins the recovery process, DeSantis emphasized the need for continued teamwork and resilience. “I think everybody responded very quickly. I’m proud of everybody’s hard work,” he said. He assured Floridians that critical infrastructure, including the Tampa airport, should reopen by Friday. “We’ve got more work to do, but we will absolutely get through this.” The coming days and weeks will reveal the full extent of Hurricane Milton’s damage. However, the state’s quick response, combined with the storm’s weakening, prevented what could have been a far greater tragedy. As Floridians begin to rebuild, they are reminded of the importance of faith in the face of adversity. The prayers for protection may not have stopped the storm entirely, but many see Hurricane Milton’s weakening as a testament to God’s mercy and a reminder that hope and prayer can carry them through even the most challenging times. A Prayer for Florida’s Recovery Heavenly Father, we come before You with gratitude for sparing Florida from greater devastation during Hurricane Milton. We thank You for hearing the prayers of Your people and weakening the storm. Lord, we lift up those who have lost loved ones, homes, and security during this time. May You comfort them and give them peace. Guide and strengthen the responders, the National Guard, and all those working tirelessly to bring relief and restoration. We pray for the rebuilding of communities and the healing of broken lives. Let Your presence be felt in every step of the recovery process. May those affected by this storm draw closer to You, finding hope, comfort, and strength in Your love. In Jesus’ name, we pray, Amen.
