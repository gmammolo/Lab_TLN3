AUGUSTINE, Fla. – One St. Augustine family will remember the day Hurricane Milton arrived much differently than many others, as they welcomed a new family member.\nKatelyn Hicks and Christopher Washington welcomed Nova Reign Washington who made her arrival at UF Health Flagler Hospital, only a few hours before Milton landed on Florida’s west coast.\nRecommended Videos\nRELATED | Downtown St. Augustine businesses, homes spared after flood waters flow into historic city\nThe new bundle of joy weighed 7 pounds and one ounce at birth.\n“Delivering our baby and then riding out a hurricane was not part of the plan and certainly unexpected,” Hicks said. “We watched the palm trees blowing from our hospital room window and felt safe the entire time.
