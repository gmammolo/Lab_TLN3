  "text": "Solar storm brings northern lights to western Massachusetts SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) - Beautiful colors lit up our sky Thursday night, which led to stunning sights and photos all across New England, including in western Massachusetts. That was thanks to the aurora borealis, otherwise known as the northern lights. The skies were filled with green, pink, and magenta as the northern lights became visible in western Massachusetts. It’s something we don’t usually get to see too often and that was thanks to a strong geomagnetic storm. You may be wondering: what are the northern lights and why were we able to see them in western Massachusetts when, normally, that’s not the case? The earth has a magnetic field and the sun emits a solar wind with charged protons and electrons that come towards the earth. They travel right along the earth’s magnetic field and go right to the poles where the magnetic field is at its weakest. Those charged protons and electrons will interact with molecules in our atmosphere to create those beautiful lights and, when the geomagnetic storm is strong enough, that’s when we can see those northern lights going a little bit further south more than normal. You can see anything from those beautiful greens to some blues and reds. To view them, you want to go out into a big open sky, away from city lights, where you’re away from that light pollution and it’s also best to look at it through a long exposure camera.
