A warm October weekend on the way Chief meteorologist Jay Cardosi talks about the warm weather expected this weekend followed by a big cool-down early next week. PROCESS. NOW, YOUR WLKY WEATHER WITH CHIEF METEOROLOGIST JAY CARDOSI. ALL RIGHT, GANG, HERE IT IS FRIDAY LATE AFTERNOON. HEY. THE WEEKEND RIGHT. IT IS HERE. AND BOY, WE’RE STARTING OFF THE WEEKEND PERFECTLY WEATHER WISE. BRIGHT SUNSHINE AGAIN ON THIS FRIDAY. RIGHT NOW. CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REGION. 78 WARM DEGREES HUMIDITY, NICE AND LOW. A WEST SOUTHWEST WIND AROUND SIX MILES AN HOUR. THE WEATHER PATTERN REMAINS SO VERY QUIET ACROSS ALL OF THE OHIO VALLEY. FEW CLOUDS WELL OFF TO THE NORTH, FEW HIGH CLOUDS. THOSE WILL ACTUALLY VISIT THE REGION TOMORROW AFTERNOON. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE’RE GOING TO CALL IT PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY. CERTAINLY NO RAINFALL. THERE IS A FRONTAL SYSTEM OFF TO THE NORTH, BUT LOTS OF THAT ENERGY WILL STAY WELL OFF TO THE NORTH OF US THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BOTTOM LINE, WE’RE EXPECTING WARM, DRY CONDITIONS FOR YOUR SATURDAY AND YOUR SUNDAY, AND EVEN THIS EVENING. NOT ALL THAT BAD, RIGHT? BOY, IT’S GOING TO BE WONDERFUL. 74 AT SEVEN, DOWN TO 70 AT EIGHT. AND WE’LL SLIP INTO THE MID 60S A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THIS EVENING. OKAY. WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING, MAINLY CLEAR SKIES WILL GREET YOU. THOSE TEMPERATURES COOL. BUT NOT CHILLY. I MEAN, IT’S GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL START. UPPER 40S, LOW 50S IN THE OUTLYING REGIONS AROUND 55 RIGHT HERE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA. WEATHER IN MOTION ON THE FUTURECAST. THERE ARE THOSE HIGH CLOUDS TRICKLING THROUGH, MOST NOTABLY IN THE AFTERNOON. ASIDE FROM THAT, IT WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY AND LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS ON YOUR SATURDAY AFTERNOON. WOW. UPPER 70S, LOW 80S. WELL ABOVE AVERAGE 92. THE OFFICIAL HIGH IS FORECAST IN TOWN TOMORROW. WE’RE GOING TO BE EVEN WARMER ON SUNDAY. OKAY, U OF L THERE OUT AT VIRGINIA, I BELIEVE TOMORROW UK THERE AT HOME. IF YOU’RE HEADING OVER 64 EASTBOUND TO LEXINGTON TOMORROW EVENING, 7.45 AT KROGER FIELD. BIG BALL GAME. VANDY COMING TO TOWN. THEY HAD THAT HUGE UPSET LAST WEEK. HERE’S THE FORECAST GAME TIME AROUND 745. KICKOFF 71 DEGREES. IT’S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL THROUGH THAT GAME 66 FOR THE LAST PLAY. SO WE HAVE THE 82 TOMORROW. WE’LL JUMP UP TO 83 TO 85 AS WE MOVE ON INTO SUNDAY. A WARM DAY RIGHT? ENJOY THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME CHANGES IN STORE AFTER THAT. A BIG DIP IN THE JET STREAM IS GOING TO BE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN ONE HALF OF THE LOWER 48 BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. THAT WILL SEND A LOT OF COOL WEATHER DOWN INTO THE REGION. SO AFTER THE 80S, THIS WEEKEND, I THINK WE’LL BE IN THE UPPER 50S AND LOW 60S FOR MONDAY TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. ALL RIGHT. HERE’S OUR FORECAST NOW FOR THIS EVENING. CLEAR AND PLEASANT 70S BACK INTO THE 60S. YOUR DETAILED 12 HOUR FORECAST TOMORROW. WE’LL START OUT IN THE MID 50S. A LITTLE COOLER IN THE OUTLYING REGIONS. AND THEN JUST WONDERFUL MIX OF HIGH CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE, HIGH TEMPERATURES OF 82. WE’LL GO 85 ON SUNDAY. THEN THAT FRONT MOVES THROUGH AND IT TURNS QUITE A BIT COOLER WITH UPPER 50S AND LOW 60S ACROSS THE VIEWING AREA. MONDAY AND TUESDAY, EVEN INTO WEDNESDAY AND AS WE CLEAR OUT THOSE SKIES COMPLETELY BY WEDNESDAY MORNING AND AGAIN THURSDAY MORNING COULD BE JUST COLD ENOUGH TO SEE SOME PATCHY FROST ACROSS THE REGION.
