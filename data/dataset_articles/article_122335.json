  "text": "STATEWIDE -- If you stepped outside Thursday night, you may have caught a glimpse of the Northern lights -- they were visible across our state and some of our viewers captured some eye-catching photos. According to Shawn Laatsch, director of the Versant Power Astronomy Center at the University of Maine, this is because the Sun is nearing the peak of the solar cycle -- which means more solar flares and the release of charged particles, leading to more frequent viewings in recent months. Those particles then collide with molecules in our own atmosphere -- creating those beautiful colors. \"The Sun has a variety of solar weather, and when it typically has what are called major solar flares or storms, it will release particles that will travel out on the solar wind. They impact the Earth's atmosphere and they're sort of deflected by our magnetic field,\" said Laatsch. Most smartphones can capture the phenomenon, even if you can't see it with the naked eye. So, if you're having trouble viewing the Northern lights when they come around, Laatsch says you might want to snap a picture of the night sky anyways. \"If you go out and they're saying you might see Aurora but you don't see it, try taking a picture of the Northern sky. Usually, a few-second exposure will help you find it,\" said Laatsch. Additionally, Laastch says dark skies are essential for viewing the Northern lights, which means heading out of the city and waiting until late at night for the best views. But you might get more chances as the Sun gets closer to peak activity next year. \"Aurora are always very difficult to predict, and one of the reasons is it depends on that particle stream from the Sun -- sometimes we have more, sometimes we have less. Right now, we're moving toward a solar maximum, which will happen sometime early next year and as a result we'll probably have more of these solar storms,\" said Laatsch. If you missed the phenomenon Thursday night, Laatsch says there's a chance you could see them again Friday night. You can visit spaceweather.com to track the latest solar flares and find viewing conditions in your area.",
