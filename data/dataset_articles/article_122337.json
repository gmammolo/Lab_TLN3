We warm up this weekend before a big drop in temps next week.\nWITH OUR METEOROLOGIST ALLISON ROGERS. IT IS BEAUTIFUL OUT THERE FOR JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TONIGHT FOR YOUR FRIDAY NIGHT HIGH. ALLISON. IT IS. HEY THERE. SHERRY. LOOK AT THIS. SO, HALLOWEEN HOT GOING ON AT KINGS ISLAND. AND I KNOW IT’S NOT DARK YET, BUT STILL, YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE FUN THAT’S GOING ON THERE. LOOK AT THE SKELETONS THERE ON INTERNATIONAL STREET. SO A GOOD NIGHT FOR THAT. IT’S GOING TO BE CLEAR. IT’S GOING TO BE QUIET. IT’S GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL. A GOOD NIGHT IF YOU’RE HEADED OUT TO ANY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES OR IF THE KIDS HAVE HOMECOMING GOING ON THIS WEEKEND. AWESOME. FOR ANY OF THOSE EVENTS. I MEAN, IT’S 73 RIGHT NOW IN CINCINNATI. WE HAVE 75 IN HAMILTON. IT’S 74 IN DALE. HIGH TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT NORTHERN KENTUCKY ARE SITTING ANYWHERE FROM 73 UP TO 75. AND INDEPENDENCE AT 79. IN OXFORD. AND ACTUALLY MORE OF THAT TO COME FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO REACH INTO THE 80S. BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. NOW, AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF TONIGHT AGAIN, I MENTIONED IT’S PERFECT, BUT HERE’S FURTHER PROOF 65 DEGREES CLOSER TO ABOUT SEVEN. AND THEN TEMPERATURES START TO FALL DOWN TO ABOUT 58 AS THE SUN SETS OVERNIGHT AND WE GET CLOSER TO THE FOURTH QUARTER. SO RIGHT AROUND ABOUT 10 OR 11:00 TONIGHT, DOWN TO THE UPPER 50S AS WE GO THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW, YOU MIGHT SEE AN OCCASIONAL CLOUD MOVING THROUGH OVERNIGHT, THOUGH IT’S GOING TO STAY QUIET AND DRY. WE DO HAVE A SOUTHWEST WIND MOVING IN HERE TONIGHT, AND THAT’S ACTUALLY GOING TO KEEP TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT INTO THE 50S. SO NOT AS CHILLY AS YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING TOMORROW. SO IF YOU’RE DOING THE QUEEN BEE, IT SHOULD FEEL GREAT. IF YOU’RE RUNNING IT NOW. OF COURSE, IF YOU’RE ON THE SIDELINES CHEERING SOMEONE ON A LITTLE BIT CHILLY FOR YOU. SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN EXTRA SWEATSHIRT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR THE MORNING. BUT AS WE GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY, WE’LL SEE A COUPLE CLOUDS PASSING BY OCCASIONALLY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES CLIMBING UP TO 80 DEGREES. NOW, AS WE GET INTO NEXT WEEK, HERE’S WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. A DRY FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON SUNDAY. THERE IS A CHANCE OF A PASSING SHOWER ON SUNDAY, BUT I DO, FOR THE MOST PART THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE DRY. SO WITH THAT FRONT MOVING THROUGH ON SUNDAY INTO MONDAY, EVEN THOUGH IT’S NOT BRINGING US ANYTHING IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, IT IS GOING TO BRING US SOME SERIOUSLY COOL WEATHER AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEK. EVEN COLD AT TIMES. SO HIGH TEMPERATURES. THAT’S THE NUMBER THAT YOU SEE HERE 58 ON MONDAY, 57, TUESDAY, 59 ON WEDNESDAY. BUT WE WILL FALL DOWN INTO THE 30S IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE DROPPING DOWN TO ANYWHERE FROM ABOUT 35 TO 37 DEGREES FOR A COUPLE OF THESE MORNINGS. SO FROST IS A POSSIBILITY. THEN ON TOP OF THAT, OF COURSE, IT’S JUST GOING TO BE COLD. YOU MIGHT EVEN HAVE TO WAKE UP A LITTLE BIT EARLY. MAKE SURE THE WINDSHIELD DOESN’T NEED DEFROSTING IN THE MORNINGS. I THINK, ESPECIALLY ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY MORNING, THAT’S WHEN I THINK IT’S GOING TO BE THE COLDEST THURSDAY MORNING FOR SURE. BUT NOTICE WE DO START TO WARM UP MORE SO AS WE GET INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S 64 THURSDAY 68 ON FRIDAY.
