  "text": "WASHINGTON (7News) — Reporter's Notebook: What a show the universe put on for us Thursday night – stunning images of magenta, pink, purple, and green dancing in the night sky. We spoke with a few photographers who said capturing the Northern Lights last night was like watching sky magic. ---- The Northern Lights – also known as aurora borealis – dazzled the senses thanks to powerful sun particles slamming into Earth’s atmosphere. Our planet’s magnetic field guided those particles toward our poles. What stargazers witnessed last night – the Super Bowl for sky watchers. “My brush is my camera and my palette is the world,\" said J.A. Rodriguez. Professional photographer J.A. Rodriguez remains in utter awe of what he saw last night from his camera while working along Skyline Drive. I felt like I was in a box of Crayola crayons. I kid you not. It was so powerful,\" said Rodriguez. Rodriguez said seasoned photographers and amateurs alike along Skyline Drive were either watching in stunned silence or screaming with joy. SEE IT: Northern Lights illuminate sky over DC, Maryland, Virginia and beyond “It was surreal. It was almost like I forgot the camera when it happened. It’s almost as if I forgot it and I was just admiring nature and what was happening. The sky went from grey and all of a sudden, the colors just dropped. Then you saw greens, and pinks, and reds, and blues, and columns. If you’ve never seen the northern lights, ok, look for them. You have to do it at least once in your lifetime,\" concluded Rodriguez. For Kathleen Cairns, the magic unfolded while attending a football game in Maryland. “And then all of a sudden the band members and then people watching turned around and were all going to the top of the stands to look out onto the soccer field,\" said Cairns. She added, “And the colors were just amazing. Amazing doesn’t even describe it and it lasted about four minutes and kind of faded out. No one was watching the football game at that moment, so that was funny.” READ MORE | Will there be another chance to see the Northern Lights in the DMV? Cairns said the stands fell silent amid the euphoria of that moment. “I have been to Iceland and I’ve been to Scotland several times even in the winter. I have never seen the northern lights. So, now I see the Northern Lights in Maryland. That’s insane!\" concluded Cairns. Scientists say if you missed the light show last night, you’ll have more opportunities in the coming months since the sun is in a cycle of ejecting a lot of particles.",
