  "text": "By HANNAH POWELL ,\n1 hours ago\nJANESVILLE — The aurora borealis — or northern lights — have put on a memorable show in Wisconsin this week.\nThursday night marked the second biggest geomagnetic storm this year, with the first back in May. That made the aurora borealis highly visible all the way down to the southern region of the United States.\nThere was potential for another viewing Friday night, though less spectacular, if the cloudy skies let up, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe best time to view the northern lights is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\nGeomagnetic storms are not harmful to humans directly but can cause radio and GPS disruptions.\nWith the sun reaching the peak of its 11-year cycle in 2025, northern lights sightings will become more frequent and even more visible due to the increase of electromagnetic activity.\nKeep an eye on your local weather reports for future chances to see these striking late night sky shows.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
