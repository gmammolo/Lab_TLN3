  "text": "The northern lights were on display Thursday night across Northern Virginia. About an hour after sunset, a dazzling light show illuminated the night skies, captivating residents across the region. Like earlier this year, the lights were visible across more parts of the country than usual, as far south as Florida and as far west as California. The sky lit up in pink, red and purple hues over the National Mall in Washington, D.C, which is unusual due to the light pollution in the nation’s capital. But 75 miles west of Washington, D.C., in Shenandoah National Park, the phenomenon known as aurora borealis wowed skywatchers with a light show so vibrant it may have been a once-in-a-lifetime experience. “Everyone was in awe,” said Robin Finehout, a retired science teacher and Prince William County resident who gazed at the lights from the Signal Knob overlook at the national park. While Finehout might have been able to see the lights from her home in the mid-county area, she decided to make the trek west for the best viewing in the dark sky away from suburban lights, she said. Finehout arrived around 6 p.m. and said she watched the sunset and even saw a comet. Then, she said, the aurora colors started around 8 p.m., first to the north but later toward the west. “They were bright pink at first, then turned green and even light purple,” she said. “Toward 9:30 p.m., hundreds of people started coming!” Finehout said. “It was like ‘Close Encounters of the Third Kind.’” The audience first included “aurora chasers with large cameras,” and later families who rushed to the park after learning about the lights on social media, she said. People were “oohing and aahing and even cheering.” Finehout said she was glad to witness the phenomenon with others. “To me, it seemed like everyone was looking for something joyous and a community to share in it,” she said. The lights were also visible across Nokesville, including over the baseball fields at Nokesville Park off Aden Road. Coaches paused a Brentsville Baseball League game long enough for the teams to take in the lights, which glowed hot pink over the trees lining the baseball diamonds. Thursday’s light show was caused by a solar event called a c[oronal mass ejection](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections) that created the big geomagnetic storm that’s associated with bright and active auroras. The coronal mass ejection erupted from the sun on Tuesday and arrived in the Earth’s atmosphere on Thursday, as predicted, but it was visible from a much larger area than expected, according to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration It’s not clear when the northern lights might again be visible from Northern Virginia. Because the storm is settling down, the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center said there’s nearly no chance of viewing them locally tonight.
