  "text": "Northern Lights in California: Will there be another chance to see an aurora on Friday?\nThe aurora borealis dazzled people across the United States on Thursday.\nThe aurora borealis dazzled people across the United States on Thursday.\nThe aurora borealis dazzled people across the United States on Thursday.\nNorthern California skywatchers hoping for another chance to capture photos of the Northern Lights on Friday do not appear to face conditions as favorable as they were a night earlier.\nNOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Thursday, saying that auroras could become visible in Northern California.\nNOAA’s aurora forecast dashboard had a view line that extended to southern Oregon. Even so, many people across Northern California outside city lights could capture photos of the Northern Lights with camera equipment on Thursday night. To the naked eye, the glow was much less pronounced, if at all.\nNOAA’s aurora dashboard for Friday shows the view line extending toward southern Washington, which is still further south than usual.\nMeteorologist Dirk Verdoorn said Friday afternoon that the forecast is mostly clear for Friday night.\nThose who want to see if they can capture an aurora borealis with their smartphone camera can check during the peak hours of 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.\n| LEARN MORE | What's behind the northern lights that dazzled the sky farther south than normal\nSee more coverage of top California stories here | Download our app | Subscribe to our morning newsletter",
