  "text": "Friday morning Gov. Roy Cooper made his first trip to Transylvania County to visit people and businesses impacted by Hurricane Helene and shared the message that his administration and federal disaster officials are here to help.\n“This is a unique and devastating disaster that has occurred here,” Cooper said. “I know there are thousands of assessments that have already been made. Assessments of damages leads to quicker recovery and that work is ongoing. We’ve been here to assist, but it’s going to be the strength of the local people in western North Carolina that’s going to be the heart of this recovery.”\nCooper toured Pisgah Fish Camp off Old Hendersonville Highway Friday at the invitation of former County Commissioner Mike Hawkins, whose family founded the popular local restaurant in 1968. The building sustained massive flooding from the Sept. 26 storms and began the process of repairing water-logged flooring and flood-damaged walls Tuesday, but the restaurant may not reopen until the Christmas holidays.\n“This is the twelfth or thirteenth county that I’ve been in and the devastation has been catastrophic, but the determination and courage of the people of western North Carolina has been indescribable in that it has been so very strong. The commitment to build back better, stronger and more resilient is ever-present. What’s happening is a coordinated, massive effort that is unprecedented in North Carolina.”\nAs of Friday morning, officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said they have already approved 1,200 households in Transylvania County for individual assistance and $1.4 million directly to local survivors of the storm with more assistance on the way.\n“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and this is such an unprecedented crisis that we need to do more than that,” Cooper said. “I want to work in a bi-partisan way with the State Legislature and Congress to come up with some kind of grant program for our small businesses because many of them are looking at devastation and have to decide if they are going to rebuild. We want to help them in a more resilient way because we want them to stay here and we want them to be here.”\n“This was a tremendously massive storm impacting a lot of communities all the way through the Gulf Coast and through North Carolina and Tennessee as well,” said FEMA Deputy Director Erik Hooks as he stood beside Cooper in the fish camp parking lot. “Despite the fact that we’ve had to deal with Hurricane Milton, the work is ongoing for western North Carolina and we’ll continue to be with you throughout the entire time.\n“The president and vice-president have been unambiguously clear that the full weight of the federal government will be here for this great governor and this great community.”\nAs local elected officials and county staff thanked the governor for coming to Pisgah Forest, they also shared their appreciation for the ongoing support state agencies directed to Transylvania County at a time when many other neighboring communities were wrecked by Helene’s unrelenting wrath even more than what was experienced in Transylvania County.\n“First and foremost, we are so thankful that we did not lose any lives in the storm and that is partially due to support from Emergency Management,” said Transylvania County Manager Jaime Laughter. “We put in an early request for two swift water rescue teams and two high-clearance vehicles. We know that saved some of our citizens’ lives and some of our first responders’ lives.”\n“Transylvania County is very lucky and very blessed that our facilities did not sustain any major damage,” School Superintendent Lisa Fletcher told Cooper. “We are all accounted for and we are so excited to go back Monday. We are really blessed compared to our brothers and sisters around us.”\nBrevard Mayor Maureen Copelof shared with Cooper that the downtown area was largely spared the brunt of the storm, but explained that it did not escape without its own set of ongoing challenges created by the flood waters.\n“We have housing areas where we have displaced families. We have a trailer park that was pretty much wiped out. We have houses where the water was 6-feet high,” Copelof said. “We had to take 58 people out of home by raft in the middle of the hurricane and our first responders did that safely, but it’s going to be a long recovery. Even though you don’t see that much damage everywhere, people have lost so much. Those who have lost their homes tend to be a lot of lower-income families. We already had an issue here with affordable housing. This has just really compounded the problem.”\nShe also praised the cooperative work between so many city, county and state agencies at a time when assistance was so desperately needed.\n“Even though we have had trauma and suffering, I look out with such pride how the county and the city have stood together, how the different state agencies and our faith organizations have stood up,” Copelof said. “We have had such a massive effort to feed people and we have come through it. We have survived and we are going to move forward, but we are going to need a lot of help. That is why I am so glad that you are here today because you are going to be hearing from us and we will need assistance. There’s just no way around it. People are hurting and we need to take care of our people.”\n“I’m glad you pointed out this disaster is so much different than the disasters we’ve seen across the country,” Cooper responded. “It is really unprecedented and it’s really complex because of the topography and the way the water flows here, but one thing that remains constant across the country is that those who get hit hardest are those who can afford it the least.\n“That is something we want to put at a priority as well. I know it’s going to be a massive effort here and it’s going to require a massive investment. Billions and billions of dollars is what it’s going to take, but I’m hearing from people on both sides of that aisle that they’re ready to make that commitment.”\nTags Federal Emergency Management Agency Emergency Management Natural Disasters Natural Events Disasters Humanitarian Crises Transylvania County, North Carolina Atmospheric Circulation Atlantic Hurricanes Tropical Cyclones Weather Events Storms Atlantic Hurricane Seasons Natural Hazards Vortices Meteorology Tropical Meteorology Tropical Cyclone Seasons Pacific Hurricanes Tropics Climate Of The United States Storm Synoptic Meteorology And Weather Seasons Branches Of Meteorology North Carolina Trending Video Recommended for you Trending Recipes Obituaries Billie Jo Farmer Mooney",
