  "text": "By Addison Green ,\n59 minutes ago\n\"\nTemperatures get warmer for Saturday, reaching into the 70s. There will also be sunny skies and a pleasant breeze. Sunday has a chance for showers. Most locations south of I-84 will stay dry through the day. Areas north of that interstate will see scattered showers through the day. Eventually, everyone will see on-and-off rain showers overnight and into Monday morning. A system will be swinging through the region Sunday into Monday. And once it leaves us by midday Monday, cooler and drier air will return to the region. The temperature roller coaster we have been on this week will continue into next week. Temperatures will cool down into the 60s and 50s through the week, and breezy winds will be around Tuesday and Wednesday. Long sleeves, coats, hoodies and hats will be needed. This type of warm and cool temperatures could lead to many catching a cold. Temperatures get back to seasonal levels by next Friday and for next weekend. TROPICS: There are two systems being monitored by the National Hurricane Center. Leslie is in the open waters of the central Atlantic Ocean and doesn't pose a threat to any landmasses. It will be heading in a northeasterly direction, then turning east through the next several days. It is a tropical storm now and will weaken to a tropical depression by Monday. The second system is off the west coast of Africa. It will move to the northwest and has a 50% chance of development in the next two to seven days. 10-DAY FORECAST: OVERNIGHT: Mostly clear, cool and crisp. Not as cold as the previous night. Lows: low- to mid-50s. SATURDAY: Mainly sunny with above-average temperatures and a breeze at times. Highs: low- to mid-70s. Lows: mid-40s. SUNDAY: Sun and clouds with a chance for showers during the day (north of I-84) and late in the day for everywhere else. Highs: mid- to upper 60s. Lows: mid-50s. MONDAY: After scattered early showers fade, partly cloudy skies and breezy winds at times will follow. Highs: low-60s. Lows: upper-30s to low-40s. TUESDAY: Partly cloudy and breezy. Highs: mid-50s. Lows: upper-30s to low-40s. WEDNESDAY: Partly cloudy and breezy. Highs: mid-50s. Lows: upper-30s. THURSDAY: Sunny. Highs: upper-50s to low-60s. Lows: upper-30s to low-40s. FRIDAY: Sunny. Highs: mid-60s. Lows: mid-40s. SATURDAY: Sunny. Highs: mid-60s. Lows: mid-40s. SUNDAY: Mostly sunny. Highs: mid- to upper 60s. Lows: upper-40s. MONDAY: Mostly sunny. Highs: upper-60s. Lows: upper-40s. \" Expand All Read in NewsBreak",
