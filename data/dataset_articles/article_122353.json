  "text": "Auroras lit up the sky in vibrant shades of purple, red and green across the north country ans various parts of the world Thursday night.\nHave you seen the northern lights this week? You voted: Yes! Maybe I tried, but didn't see anything I haven't been watching for them Vote View Results Back The lights, normally only visible closer to the planet’s poles, were seen throughout the United States and Europe and also illuminated parts of Australia, because of an unusually strong geomagnetic storm, rated 4 out of 5, or “severe” by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nIn the United States, the northern lights, or aurora borealis, reached unusually far south, into Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Arizona.\nThursday’s geomagnetic storm, which arrived in the morning and continued deep into the night, was created by an explosion of solar particles and energy on the sun, called a coronal mass ejection, which temporarily disturbed Earth’s protective magnetic bubble. The fast-moving ejection hit Earth at nearly 1.5 million mph.\nAs some of the solar particles traveled along our planet’s magnetic field lines into the upper atmosphere, they excited nitrogen and oxygen molecules, and released photons of light in different colors — or the aurora. At lower latitudes, red auroras were more common because red occurs at higher altitudes and can be seen farther from the poles.\nThe northern lights first reached Europe on Thursday — producing colorful skies in London and even into southern France. Some aurora chasers expressed concern the light show might fade before sunset in the United States, but it held strong — delighting sky watchers from coast to coast.\nSome locations that missed the northern lights in May, including D.C., were treated to the rare spectacle. In the D.C. area, the lights could be seen even with the naked eye between about 7:10 and 7:25 p.m., and then with more sensitive camera lenses for the rest of the evening.\nThese intense geomagnetic storms are occurring amid the peak of the 11-year solar cycle, when such outbursts from the sun are most probable. Space scientists told The Washington Post in August that many more instances of the northern lights may still be in the pipeline.\n“The next three or four years, we should see some fine displays of aurora,” said Bob Leamon, a solar physicist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and NASA. “It’s like a whole generation of people discovering something for the first time.”\nTransfer",
