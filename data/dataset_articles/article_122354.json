That clash, if strong and persistent enough, can produce the Northern Lights, a dancing display of brilliant reds, greens, and purples in the northern nighttime sky.\nFor it to be seen in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, we do need an especially strong storm, and for just the right interaction at the top of the atmosphere. The planetary \"k-index\" is used to measure the strength of the geomagnetic storm, and as of Thursday evening, the k-index was around an 8.\nFor the aurora to be visible here, we generally need a k-index value of at least a 7, with an 8 or a 9 more favorable for more widespread and colorful Northern Lights displays.\nIn order to view any potential auroras, it's rather simple. Find a dark spot away from light pollution, and a spot with a clear view of the northern horizon, and look north.\nGood auroras can easily be viewed by the naked eye. More marginal auroras are more easily viewed with long-exposure cameras or other equipment.\nMother Nature will cooperate as far as viewing conditions are concerned, as skies will be mainly clear throughout the night. But it will be a chilly night with frost possible towards morning, so dress warmly if you're going out in search of those colorful lights.\nThe strength and duration of the geomagnetic storm can be fickle and tough to forecast, so any changes in either can increase or decrease our chances of seeing the colorful light display. But at least for now, any time after darkness settles in (sunset is 6:30 p.m. Thursday evening) may be worth a glance towards the northern skies to try your luck.\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Dan Skeldon Meteorologist\nAuthor facebook Author twitter Author email Follow Dan Skeldon Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!
