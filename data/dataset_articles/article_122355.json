  "text": "7 days ago President Joe Biden took to X today to share an update on his administration’s efforts to support communities affected by Hurricane Helene. His post, captioned \"Here's an update on my Administration's ongoing efforts to support communities impacted by Hurricane Helene,\" highlighted the following key recovery statistics:\nMore than 9,000 federal personnel are involved in response and recovery efforts. Over $408 million in assistance has been provided to survivors. More than 12.6 million meals and 12.7 million liters of water have been delivered to impacted states. Over 1,000 urban search and rescue personnel have helped more than 3,200 survivors. FEMA Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams are actively on the ground. Though the earlier figures focused on Hurricane Helene, Biden also shared another update today addressing Floridians impacted by recent storms. His message read:\n\"To the people of Florida:\nI know recovery and rebuilding periods can be long and difficult. And that long after the press and cameras move on, you have to pick up the pieces.\nBut I want you to know I will do everything in my power to help you put the pieces back together.\"\nScreenshot from POTUS X account Photo by POTUS on X With recovery efforts in progress and further assistance pledged, communities affected by Hurricane Helene and other storms can expect continued support as they work through the recovery process.",
