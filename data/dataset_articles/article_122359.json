  "text": "HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - The weekend is here, and with it comes some very festive weather. Sunshiny days and clear nights will be perfect for outdoor plans. Highs will flirt with 80 on Saturday then march well into the 80s on Sunday. The Sunday warmth will come thanks to a stiff southwest breeze.\nBy Sunday night, a cold front will arrive with a broken band of showers and thundersqualls. Gusty winds can knock some leaves down as the front passes.\nNext week behind that front, a true taste of autumn air will grace our world. Daytime highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s set us up for the first frost of the season and at Snowshoe-Canaan Valley the first dusting to inch of snow of the fall.\nEvents to enjoy this weekend include Chili-fest (Huntington), Bob Evans Farm Fest (Rio Grande), Black Walnut Fest (Spencer), Jenny Wiley Days (Prestonsburg)and the WVU game in Morgantown.\nNow with warm weather likely again for late October, you will want a gameplan next week to cover your tender plants so they can last into November this year.\nCopyright 2024 WSAZ.
