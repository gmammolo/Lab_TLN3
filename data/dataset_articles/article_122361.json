  "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Warm weather will remain firmly in control over the weekend before changes arrive next week.\nKPLC First Alert Forecast (KPLC) Highs near 90 degrees are expected both days this weekend. Humidity will start to increase a little Saturday night, so lows on Sunday morning will only fall near or above 60. But rain remains out of the forecast, which is great for any outdoor plans you might have but of course will not help the drought situation in SWLA.\nKPLC First Alert Forecast (KPLC) There’s good news for cooler weather fans out there, as another cold front will move through early next week! Models are still a bit unsure of the timing, with some suggesting it may take until Tuesday to move through fully. We’ll keep monitoring trends, but by Wednesday we’ll certainly feel the impacts. Highs may not reach the 80 degree mark on Wednesday. Morning lows look as cool or cooler than the last go around with low-to-mid 50’s likely. Some models even suggest 40’s may be possible! We won’t go that cool on the forecast quite yet but it is something we’ll watch over the weekend.\nFirst Alert Forecast (KPLC) The downside to the dry weather remains the lack of rain. We have not received any measurable rain since late September at the Lake Charles Regional Airport, and it has been since early September for the last time of appreciable rain. Accordingly, much of SWLA has been placed under the level 2/5 (moderate) drought in the US Drought Monitor. Virtually all of SWLA is under the level 1. Rain continues to be absent from the 10-day forecast, so expansion or worsening of these areas is certainly possible over the next week. This also means more burn bans may pop-up, so do be careful with any outdoor plans you have and make sure to check on local advisories.\nKPLC First Alert Forecast (KPLC) The tropics are more quiet now that Milton is gone. Leslie will weaken into a remnant low soon in the open Atlantic. A tropical wave near the African coast has a chance to develop over the next few days. After that, conditions will likely become more hostile for it. Beyond that, there are *some* signs that we may need to watch the southern Caribbean for possible development next week. But not all models agree with that and even if anything were to form, it is impossible to say right now where any system would go. So there still are no tropical worries for SWLA though we’ll continue to keep an eye on things.\nFor a look at current conditions, our hour-by-hour forecast, radar, and other forecasting tools, visit the KPLC weather page: https://www.kplctv.com/weather/\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.
