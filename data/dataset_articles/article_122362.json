  "text": "High pressure will continue to build this weekend, resulting in above average temperatures. Daytime highs will be in the 70s through early next week. Overnight lows will be chilly as they drop into the mid to upper 30s. Smoke from local and regional fires will create a noticeable haze. Enjoy the beautiful weather over the next few days because the ridge will breakdown by the middle to end of next week. Daytime highs will cool below average into the 40s and 50s. Showers will be possible with snow levels falling to as low at 4,500 feet by Thursday night.",
