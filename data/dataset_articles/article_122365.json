  "text": "It’s almost a throwback to summer this weekend in Southern Indiana as temperatures near 80 degrees make a brief comeback. While far from muggy, more humid air flowing in as soon as Saturday morning will keep low temperatures from dipping much past the lower 50s. This and abundant sunshine mixed with a few clouds Saturday afternoon sets us up for high temperatures near and just above 80 degrees. You’ll likely be able to get away with shorts and T-shirts the whole day and into the evening as temperatures won’t fall terribly much Saturday evening, with 70s likely until just after dark. We’ll wake up to upper 50s and lower 60s on Sunday morning, which is certainly warm for this time of year. Despite a cold front and a few clouds moving through in the afternoon on Sunday, we’ll only see a very small chance for an isolated shower and sprinkle during that time. High temperatures will also get close to 80 degrees again as the cooler air behind this cold front won’t arrive until late Sunday evening. That cold front will be the catalyst for a markedly cooler weather pattern next week, one that takes us down into frost territory by Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday mornings. This is when overnight lows will get down into the 30s across the region. While a freeze is somewhat unlikely, rural and suburban frost potential is certainly there. High temperatures in the afternoons next week will only top out in the 50s and 60s. weekend FORECAST SATURDAY Partly sunny HIGH: 82° SUNDAY Partly sunny Isolated shower (10%) HIGH: 80°",
