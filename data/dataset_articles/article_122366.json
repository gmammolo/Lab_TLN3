  "text": "2 hours ago Geoff Bansen ,\nWe have incredible weather lined up for Saturday. Full sunshine is expected, with temperatures in the low 70s. It will be quite breezy however! Gusts up to 30 mph are expected.\nUnfortunately, things go downhill fast into Sunday. A warm front will move into the Northeast, and depending on exact placement, temperatures may not get out of the 50s!\nIt will naturally also bring cloudy skies along with it, with some passing showers too.\nThe warm front will lift north into Sunday night and briefly dry things out, but a cold front approaches Columbus Day Monday and shower chances eventually return.\nThere could even be a thunderstorm along the way. The cold front passes Monday night and while dry weather returns for the rest of the week, a fall chill returns as well.\nDaytime temperatures won’t get out of the 50s Tuesday and Wednesday, with overnights dropping into the 30s!\nAs a result, we will see widespread frost; for those that didn’t get any early this morning, it will likely be the first of the year.\nCategories : News , Weather Forecast Facebook Pinterest Twitter Linkedin",
