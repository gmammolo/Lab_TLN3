  "text": "ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - An extended stretch of dry weather continues through the weekend into next week. Along with low humidity, clear cool nights and sunny warm days hold. Highs briefly in the 80s before Tuesday’s dry cold front ushers in the coolest air of the season so far.\nTemperatures drop from cooler upper 70s Tuesday to chilly 60s on Wednesday then cold mid 40s Thursday morning. The reinforcing shot of drier air keeps rain away through the end of the week.\nIn the tropics, NHC has given a medium 50% chance of development to a disturbance just off the west coast of Africa in the eastern Atlantic. This bears watching but remains far away from land. For now any development may be short-lived as the system tracks into an unfavorable environment in the coming days. In the central Atlantic Tropical Storm Leslie poses no threat to land as it weakens.\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction? Let us know.
