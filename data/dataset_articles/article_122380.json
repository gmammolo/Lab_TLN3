  "text": "MONTANA – Residents across the state are enjoying sunny weather with temperatures above the seasonal norms for this time of October. Highs reached the upper-60s to low-70'stoday, bringing an awesome Friday for Montanans.\nThe warm trend is set to continue into tomorrow, promising excellent conditions for Grizzly and Bobcat fans heading to home football games. Temperatures are expected to climb to the low-to-mid-70s, ensuring fantastic weather from the 10 am Homecoming Parade in Missoula to the evening kickoff at 8:15 p.m. in Bozeman.\nThroughout the weekend, Montanans can expect mostly sunny skies and clear nights. Little activity is noted on the satellite radar, with subtle gusts predicted in the eastern plains early tomorrow. Overnight lows are anticipated to range predominantly in the upper 30s to mid-40s, with Billings remaining warmer at approximately 47 degrees, and Cut Bank cooler around 30 degrees.\nAs Montana moves into the next week, a noticeable cooling pattern emerges. By next Friday, temperatures will dip to the 40s and 50s. There is a chance of showers in the second half of the week coinciding with the cooling pattern. Normal temperatures and precipitation levels are anticipated to finally arrive in the following 8 to 14 days.",
