  "text": "Tyler and Kayla Fite did not let Hurricane Milton stop them on their wedding day in Florida. (Source: WJHG) By Megan Kennedy and Jordan Gartner Published: Oct. 11, 2024 at 2:54 PM CDT | Updated: 6 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nPANAMA CITY, Fla. ( WJHG /Gray News) - Rain on your wedding day can symbolize good luck, but a hurricane can bring a lot more with it than that.\nTyler and Kayla Fite had planned to marry on the beach in Sarasota with 100 guests but plans quickly changed as Hurricane Milton headed toward the west coast of Florida earlier this week.\nHowever, the couple did not let the hurricane stop them as they tied the knot in Santa Rosa Beach Thursday evening even with a few fewer guests than planned.\n“We had our beach wedding, just on a different beach in a different location with less friends and family, but it’s OK. This is the date that we wanted, and we stuck with it!” Tyler Fite said.\nThe No. 10 is a very special number for the Fites.\n“10/10 is super special to us. I think there was just no way we weren’t going to do it,” Kayla Fite said. “It’s both of our favorite numbers growing up ... it was both of our numbers playing sports.”\nShe added, “We wanted to have an actual wedding and ceremony. That ended up getting canceled, but it wasn’t going to stop us!”\nKayla Fite’s sister, April Conrady, got her flight changed at the last minute and was one of the couple’s family members to attend their wedding.\nShe even got ordained online and was ready to help her sister pull off the big day.\n“At first, when we discussed it, it was hilarious, we were laughing about it, and then I did some research, and I was like, ‘Wait, I can actually do this!’ she said. “It’s all so emotional, and I’m just glad that I could make this happen for my sister.”\nCopyright 2024 WJHG via Gray Local Media, Inc.
