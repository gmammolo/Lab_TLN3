  "text": "Alyana Gefroh, now an occupational therapist in Florida, faced Hurricane Milton head on, choosing to stay at the hospital to care for patients during the storm. TAMPA, Fla. — Imagine getting the chance to work in an area that's surrounded by palm trees and warm weather, but then, two months, later a hurricane takes over and leaves you stuck at work. That's what happened to a University of North Dakota graduate, who is now a travel occupational therapist in Tampa, Fla. ADVERTISEMENT Alyana Gefroh, 29, graduated from UND during the COVID-19 pandemic. After graduation, she landed a job for four years before becoming a traveling occupational therapist. \"The facility prepared me as best as they could, but when you're a travel OT, you learn that you kind of have to go in expecting the unexpected, because you can only learn so much about a travel assignment until you're there and then you kind of have to hone in on your skills,\" Gefroh said. In August, she was sent to Tampa, Fla., to cover a maternity leave. Just two months later, she faced a tough decision to make as Hurricane Milton approached. \"Hurricane Milton was quite quite scary, so my husband evacuated, and then I decided to stay on ... at the hospital,\" she said. \"Because there are only so many hospitals that can evacuate, and I know our facility was one of those that took in patients from other hospitals because of the hurricane.\" As the winds picked and the rain poured, the power went out. The hospital ended up running off a backup generator. She said she made the right decision to stay. \"I felt a lot safer knowing that they were people around me, rather than being at home alone,\" Gefroh said. ADVERTISEMENT Many of the hospital staff spent their nights on air mattresses, ready to treat patients at all hours. \"Health care doesn't stop for anything,\" she said. \"(The hospital) kind of tried to run as normal as they could, working at the hospital for the patients because they're looking at us. The tension was quite high.\" A similar tension her mother reminded her they faced with typhoons where she grew up in the Philippines. \"I learned this a lot, too, that until COVID came, and then obviously with disasters like this, that patients still need us,\" Gefroh said. Gefroh will be staying in Tampa until November. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT",
