He’s outside recording them. 10-year-old Jayden Lew documented his experience during Hurricane Milton on his YouTube channel, [Jayden Lee’s World.](https://www.youtube.com/@jaydenleesworld8387/featured) While most people would shelter inside their home, this kid says he’s not afraid. “Unless a tree starts falling, then I will get scared, or if shingles came off because then my window might pop open,” said Lew. “But other than that, I really like hurricanes and I enjoy them.” TRENDING: [Marion County residents continue recovering after Hurricane Milton](https://www.wcjb.com/2024/10/11/marion-county-residents-continue-recovering-after-hurricane-milton/) Milton wasn’t his first storm either. He covered Hurricane Ian two years ago, along with Tropical Storm Nicole, and Hurricane Helene a few weeks back. This fifth grader does all the recording, but says he gets some help from self-proclaimed ‘momager’ Cheryl Reith. “He has to take a look at everything and tell me hey this is okay, this lettering is okay, those graphics are okay,” said Reith. “I always get the approval from him before I’m allowed to post anything.” Jayden says he likes feeling the wind and rain, and knows how to make good content by watching the storms outside. “I might be like a hurricane hunter, flying for the storms cause the eye looks really cool and you get to feel the wind,” he continued. “In front of you, all you see is all that gray wind and rain, so I would like to fly for that.” It’s an interest this kid picked up from his mom, who says she loves watching storms and making memories with her son. “We were out here filming this so we were getting pounded with rain, we were cold, we were wet, we were getting blown away, but it was so fun,” said Reith.
