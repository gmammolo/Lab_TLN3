  "text": "Animal Kingdom’s inhabitants are safely back home after sheltering during the hurricane Hurricane Milton passed through Walt Disney World on the night of October 9, bringing strong winds and rain that prompted park closures and extensive cleanup efforts. However, the thousands of animals that call the parks home, particularly at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, were safely protected during the storm. On October 11, Dr. Mark Penning, Vice President of Disney’s Animals, Science, and Environment, shared an update on Instagram, praising the dedication of the resort’s animal experts in keeping the animals that call Animal Kingdom home safe during the storm.\nRelated: Disney’s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park Expected to Open this Weekend\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Dr. Mark Penning (@drmarkatdisney)\n“Just as our cast members and guests rode out the storm during Hurricane Milton, our team of animal experts cared for the thousands of animals that call Walt Disney World home,” Penning wrote. He highlighted the team’s vigilance during the storm, ensuring the safety of animals ranging from butterflies to flamingos, and even the family of western lowland gorillas. Animal care teams monitored conditions closely and sprang into action to clear storm debris before returning the animals to their habitats once the storm passed.\nRelated: Disney World Extends Cancellation & Change Fees Policy Due to Hurricane Milton\nFallen tree limbs on Kilimanjaro Safaris following Hurricane Milton As of October 11, Walt Disney World theme parks, including Animal Kingdom, have fully reopened. Animal experiences have resumed, with the animals safely back in their natural environments. We visited Animal Kingdom on the 11th and found the park to be in tip top shape with the only signs of damage coming in the form of some fallen tree limbs on the safari . This careful coordination is a testament to the behind-the-scenes efforts of Disney’s wildlife professionals, ensuring the well-being of these creatures during and after the storm.\nThis effort reminds us of the extraordinary commitment Disney places on caring for the wildlife in its parks, even in the face of unpredictable natural events like Hurricane Milton.",
