Updated: 11:37 PM EDT Oct 11, 2024 UP NEXT IN SPORTS. THIS IS A WPBF 25 EDITORIAL. HERE IS PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER CAROLINE TAPLETT ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, HURRICANE MILTON ROARED INTO OUR AREA, LEAVING DEVASTATING IMPACTS FROM MULTIPLE TORNADOES, INCLUDING AN EF THREE RIGHT HERE IN PALM BEACH COUNTY. OUR TEAM IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZED TO GET ON AIR AND ONLINE, PROVIDING LIFE SAVING EMERGENCY INFORMATION TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WPBF 25 WAS FIRST ON AIR WITH 75 HOURS OF NONSTOP CONTINUOUS COVERAGE, INFORMING AND EDUCATING OUR VIEWERS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE WERE OVER 100 TORNADO WARNINGS IN OUR AREA. TO ME, THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF LOCAL BROADCASTERS AND THE VITAL ROLE WE PLAY IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE ARE THE LIFELINE TO OUR CITIZENS WHEN THEY NEED US MOST, AND THERE IS NO OTHER MEDIUM THAT CAN MOBILIZE SO QUICKLY. WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND DISSEMINATING CRITICAL INFORMATION IN REAL TIME, WE HAVE RECEIVED SO MANY NOTES AND LETTERS THANKING US FOR OUR SERVICE. ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER, IT IS US WHO WANTS TO THANK YOU. YOU STAYED WITH US DURING THE STORM. YOU TRUSTED US TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SAFE. WE CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE LIVE AND WORK WITH EVERY DAY, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE WILL BE HERE FOR YOU TOO. IN THE AFTERMATH, HELPING TO SUPPORT ALL OF OUR CLEANUP EFFORTS AND TO REBUILD OUR COMMUNITY. THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL OUR LOYAL VIEWERS AND PLEASE KNOW IT IS OUR HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO SERVE YOU EVERY DAY, ESPECIALLY IN LIFE THREATENING TIMES LIKE THESE.
