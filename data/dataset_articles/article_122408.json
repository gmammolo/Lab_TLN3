  "text": "Will northern lights be visible again tonight in Arizona? The northern lights were visible across Arizona on Thursday night, with people capturing photos of the rare phenomenon from Flagstaff to southern Tucson. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center reported that a coronal mass ejection occurred on October 8, when solar material and magnetic fields erupted. This triggered a geomagnetic storm, which reached Earth on Thursday, making the aurora borealis visible in parts of the country. Although NOAA predicted the aurora would be visible as far south as northern Utah on Thursday night, [some Arizonans](https://www.azcentral.com/picture-gallery/news/local/arizona/2024/10/11/northern-lights-visible-in-arizona/75627200007/) in areas with low light pollution were able to catch a glimpse. Many residents shared the rare sight of pink and purple beams over the desert skies on social media. \"What a magical night!,\" one user posted with a timelapse video of the lights as seen just outside of Tucson. Here's the science behind this charming sky phenomenon, and when Arizona residents may be able to see it again. What is a geomagnetic storm? Why were northern lights visible so far south? A geomagnetic storm is a disturbance in Earth's protective magnetic field caused by solar flares unleashing coronal mass ejections toward Earth. When large enough, these plasma eruptions from the sun's corona can cause the aurora borealis to be visible further south. Thursday's storm was a category four out of five, considered severe and uncommon, according to Dahl. However, there have been five category 4 or higher storms in the past few years. Dahl said these storms are becoming stronger and more frequent because the solar cycle reached a period called solar maximum last year. \"Activity like this tends to happen more than it does at any other point in the 11-year cycle of the sun,\" he said. Thursday's space weather event follows a [historic occurrence in May](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2024/05/20/northern-lights-in-arizona-2024/73767877007/), when a geomagnetic storm, featuring the [strongest solar flare in seven years](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/15/sun-solar-flare-nasa-geometric-storm/73697831007/), reached the top category 5. That storm also treated Arizonans to a natural spectacle similar to Thursday's. When will northern lights be visible again in Arizona? The storm was likely to persist through this evening, but lights were unlikely to be seen again from Arizona because solar winds were slowing down, ostensibly weakening the storm into a category 2 by Friday evening, Dahl said. Still, if solar activity picks up, people can have a chance to catch the lights once again. \"The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right,\" according to NOAA statement. Dahl said Arizonans will also have several opportunities to enjoy similar space weather shows in the next few years as the solar cycle reaches its peak. Peak solar activity is expected either later this year or early next year, Dahl explained. However, \"it doesn't just shut off ... it's a slow comedown,\" he said. \"So the rest of this year, all of next year, and even until the year 2026, we’re still going to have a possibility of more storms like that.\" (This story was updated to add a photo.)",
