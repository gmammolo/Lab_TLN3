  "text": "Credits- Mark Mandale, X Skygazers in many parts of the world were treated to colourful Northern Lights at latitudes beyond the polar extremes where they normally light up the skies. The Northern Lights illuminated the skies over the UK and parts of the US, with hues of striking purple, pink, and indigo. The aurora show was caused by a powerful solar flare that triggered a geomagnetic storm.\nThis storm in turn sparked northern and southern lights -- aurora borealis and aurora australis -- in swathes of Europe, the United States, Australia and elsewhere. An unexpected display of the auroras was visible further south than predicted.\nAccording to the Met Office, the light show was expected to be seen only up to the Midlands. However, the phenomenon extended, giving more people the chance to witness it. In the United States, parts of the northern states also experienced this dazzling event.\nNorthern Lights with shooting star seen in UK Many social media users shared stunning pictures of spectacular views on Thursday as the northern lights appeared as bright, dynamic curtains of colour in the night sky of the northern hemisphere. A user by X, Mark Mandale , shared a picture of a shooting star that occurred during the northern lights in the UK, leaving the internet in awe. \"OMG OMG!!!! Look at that a shooting star, what a shot!!!! #auroa #northernlights,\" he wrote in the caption.\n— cumbrianbluess (@cumbrianbluess)\nMarketing\nDigital Marketing Masterclass by Neil Patel\nBy - Neil Patel, Co-Founder and Author at Neil Patel Digital Digital Marketing Guru",
