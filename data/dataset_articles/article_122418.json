  "text": "( MENAFN - Live Mint) The skies above Leh were illuminated by a breathtaking aurora display on Thursday (October 10) when a severe geomagnetic storm hit Earth. The rare occurrence was captured at India's highest observatory in Hanle.\nAlso Read | Northern lights in New York this weekend? Here's how to see aurora The event was initiated by a potent coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun that arrived at Earth on Friday. The CME stemmed from an X1.8-class solar flare on October 9 and hurtled through space at speeds surpassing 1.5 million miles per hour.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has classified the geomagnetic storm as G4, signaling severe conditions that can potentially disrupt power grids and satellite operations.\nSuch storms can make auroras visible much farther south than usual, with sightings reported as far south as Alabama and Northern California in the United States.\nAlso Read | Solar Storm 2024: Satellite operators to stay on high alert Rare auroras in LadakhIn Leh, the auroras' vibrant colours created a breathtaking spectacle against the backdrop of the night sky .\nAlso Read | Solar storm on Mars: NASA Rover hit by radiation equivalent to 30 chest X-rays The geomagnetic storm is a result of the current period of increased solar activity, with the Sun nearing its solar maximum, which is anticipated to reach its peak in 2025.\nThis cycle has resulted in a rise in solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which cause auroras when charged particles interact with Earth's magnetic field.\nThe auroras seen in Leh were the direct consequence of these interactions, displaying dazzling reds that enthralled spectators.\nWhile the visual spectacle was breathtaking, scientists cautioned against possible disruptions due to the storm.\nHigh-frequency radio communications are already experiencing interference, and there is concern about the potential impact on satellite navigation systems. Power companies and aviation authorities have been advised to monitor conditions closely to mitigate any negative impacts.\nResidents and tourists alike were captivated by the celestial light display, while experts highlighted the significance of comprehending the effects of space weather on technology and infrastructure. This geomagnetic phenomenon demonstrates the dynamic nature of our Sun and its impact on life on Earth.\nMENAFN12102024007365015876ID1108772000",
