  "text": "Following the devastating arrival of Hurricane Milton, Florida’s major theme parks, including Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, and SeaWorld, are preparing to reopen their gates on Friday. After assessing the damage caused by the Category 3 storm, the parks announced they would resume operations, though not all attractions or special events, particularly the Halloween festivities, will be available. Despite these limitations, the public is welcome to return, offering a sense of normalcy for tourists and locals alike. The parks had closed down on Wednesday as Milton made landfall, interrupting the vacation plans of thousands of tourists, many of whom sheltered in place in Orlando hotels. Hurricane Disrupts Tourist Plans The closures significantly impacted Orlando’s tourism industry, especially as the storm forced the shutdown of Orlando International Airport, Florida’s busiest airport. Flights resumed on Thursday for domestic arrivals, with departures expected to start on Friday. The shutdown left tourists like Simon Forster and his family stranded. Visiting from Scotland, they had been set to fly home but found themselves extending their stay by two days. Forster described the storm’s arrival as “intense,” with palm trees swaying violently outside their hotel window. Despite the stress of the situation, Forster noted the lively atmosphere at Universal Orlando Resort, where guests turned the ordeal into a social event. “The bar was good fun,” he said. “Two extra days here – there are worse places we could be.” For other tourists, activities like miniature golf became popular. Craig Greig of Glasgow took his family to Congo River Golf after being unable to visit the Magic Kingdom due to park closures. The family was eager to leave the hotel and enjoy some fresh air after enduring Hurricane Milton. Animal Attractions Also Rebound In Tampa, popular tourist spots ZooTampa and The Florida Aquarium are working to reopen by Saturday. Zoo officials confirmed that the animals are safe, and housed in their secure hurricane shelters. However, the zoo sustained damage from high winds, and power outages remain a challenge. Cleanup and restoration efforts are already underway, with staff working to clear debris from the animal habitats. The Florida Aquarium also reported positive news, stating that its animals fared well through the storm. “Our buildings weathered the storm well, as did our animals,” said Roger German, the aquarium’s CEO. Like ZooTampa, the aquarium is in the process of clearing debris and restoring operations before welcoming guests back. Orlando’s Resilience and Recovery Though hurricanes in the Orlando area are rare, they are not unheard of. Milton’s arrival brings back memories of the three hurricanes—Charley, Frances, and Jeanne—that struck the region in 2004 and the recent impact of Hurricane Ian in 2022, which caused significant flooding. Despite this, Orlando remains one of the most visited tourist destinations in the United States, drawing 74 million visitors last year alone. With theme parks reopening and the tourism industry bouncing back, the city is expected to recover quickly from Hurricane Milton, as it has after past storms. The resilience of both the attractions and the community ensures that Florida’s tourism hub will soon return to its vibrant state.",
