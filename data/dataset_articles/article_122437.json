  "text": "Dubai: In mid-October, the UAE will transition into the ‘Wasmi’ season, a highly anticipated period characterised by moderate temperatures that will last until December 6.\nThis season, celebrated across the Arab world, is welcomed as a respite from the intense summer heat and a prelude to the chill of winter.\nAccording to Ibrahim Al Jarwan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Emirates Astronomical Society, the ‘Wasmi’ season follows the appearance of the ‘Suhail’ star, signalling the end of extreme heat. He explained that ‘Wasmi’ is the second phase of autumn, following the season known as ‘safari.’\"\nalso see UAE weather: Heavy rain and hail in parts of Dubai, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah During the ‘Wasmi’ period, daytime temperatures become more moderate while cooler temperatures gradually take hold at night.\nBy the end of the season in December, cold weather becomes more prominent, marking the onset of winter's first phase, known as the ‘Mirba`aniya,’ when the chill intensifies.\"\nThe season is also characterised by increased agricultural activity, as conditions favour plant growth. Average temperatures range from 30 to 34 degrees Celsius at their peak and from 12 to 18 degrees Celsius at their lowest.\"\nAl Jarwan highlighted that Bedouins observe the start of the ‘Wasmi’ season by noting the alignment of stars such as Suhail and Sirius in the southern dawn sky\nAdditionally, the rains during this period, known as ‘Wasam,’ are considered beneficial for replenishing underground water sources and supporting agriculture. Some rains even arrive in the ten days leading up to the season, a phenomenon referred to as ‘preceding Wasam.",
