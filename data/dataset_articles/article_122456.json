  "text": "Stargazing New Englanders who missed the dazzling display of pink and green northern lights this week may get another shot to see them on Friday night.\nThe northern lights made a rare appearance further south than usual on Sunday and again on Thursday, thanks to a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused vibrant aurora borealis.\nAccording to the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), that solar storm has since subsided from a G4 to a G3. While the storm’s effects continue to diminish, Friday’s clear evening forecast means it’s still possible to catch a glimpse of the northern lights.\nA G3 Watch remains in effect for 11 Oct as CME effects continue to diminish. A G1 Watch is in place for 12 Oct due to lingering effects.

The lights don’t need to be directly overhead to be seen, but if the aurora is bright and conditions are right, they can be observed from as far away as 1,000 kilometers.\nBoston.com Today Sign up to receive the latest headlines in your inbox each morning.\nSubmit your email Enter your email address\nSign up",
