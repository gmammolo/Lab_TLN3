  "text": "We need the rain. We’ve had only a few drops so far this month, on the heels of an extremely dry September.\nThat normally wet month left only 1.5 inches of rain at Pittsfield Municipal Airport, compared to the historical average of 4.5 inches.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows most of Massachusetts and portions of nearby states as abnormally dry as of this past Tuesday when weekly data is collected and analyzed. That pre-drought category includes Berkshire County. The North Shore up through the New Hampshire coast and a sliver of southwest Maine already fall into a moderate drought zone.\nBut the three-day holiday weekend isn’t the ideal time for steady rain. On the bright side, look for a dry, mostly sunny, pleasantly mild but very breezy Saturday here in the Berkshires before the clouds roll in late at night.\nEarly risers may see a few showers on Sunday, but a storm system south of the Berkshires should yield some steady rain by the afternoon and evening. Total rainfall could top an inch, according to AccuWeather.com, before it ends by early Monday.\nThe forecast for the holiday into mid-week calls for blustery, chilly, unsettled conditions, according to the National Weather Service. Occasional showers are likely.\n“Some snowflakes will likely mix in at times across the higher elevations where some spotty coatings of accumulation cannot be ruled out,\" said government forecaster Brett Rathbun in an online post.\nA gradual clearing out and warmup is expected by midweek, continuing into the following weekend.\nSPECTACULAR LIGHT SHOW\nEarly Thursday evening, photos of a spectacular northern lights show popped up online from Williamstown to Great Barrington. The severe geomagnetic storm produced an awesome aurora borealis show of purple, pink and green images all across Massachusetts, the Cape and Islands between 7 and 8:30 p.m.\nThe light show even reached Texas and California. The remarkable display was caused by a massive coronal mass ejection, a large expulsion of plasma from the sun that occurred earlier this week, according to Boston Globe meteorologist Ken Mahan.\nGeomagnetic storms are harmless to humans but may cause disruptions and lasting impacts to satellites, technology and communications, per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s space weather prediction center.\nBack on Earth, the extended weather outlook from the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center for Oct. 19-25 indicates above-average temperatures and near-normal rainfall.\nDay by day . . .\nSaturday: Sunny, very windy, high around 60. Clouds gather at night, low in the mid-30s.\nSunday: Rain likely in the afternoon and after dark, high 50-55, low 40-45.\nMonday: Early morning rain, then mostly cloudy, high near 55, nighttime low near freezing.\nTuesday: Partly sunny, upper 40s; mostly cloudy at night, low around 32.\nWednesday: Partly cloudy, high 45-50, overnight low near 30.\nThursday: Mostly sunny, near 55. Clear at night, mid-30s.\nFriday: Some sunshine, 55-60; partly cloudy after dark, mid-30s.\nSaturday (Oct. 19): Sunny, mid-60s.\nSources: National Weather Service and http://AccuWeather.com",
