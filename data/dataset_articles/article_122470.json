  "text": "Colourful northern lights illuminate night skies due to solar storm Earlier this week, people across North America were treated to a surprising sight when northern lights illuminated the night skies as a result of a solar storm.\n@dressymess unexpectedly caught the northern lights today 😧 (oct 10 2024) #auroraborealis #nyc #newyorkcity #brooklynbridge #northernlights\n♬ original sound – rxnplify\nAccording to CBS News, residents in New York and New Jersey were able to see the aurora borealis early Thursday (10 Oct) evening .\n“Severe” solar storm causes night skies to light up The lights were visible as far south as Washington D.C. and Kentucky as well, reported the New York Times.\nBut perhaps most surprising was that the lights were visible in the New York metro area, despite all the light pollution.\nSource: @kirit143 on Instagram\n“To get them here to the New York metro area is pretty rare,” said New Jersey’s state meteorologist.\nThe lights were caused by a solar storm that erupted from the Sun on 8 Oct.\nThe US Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) said that Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) from the sun was expected to reach Earth on 10 Oct . It also classified the solar storm as a “severe” one.\nAdditionally, New York authorities warned the solar storm could potentially, although unlikely, cause disruptions to radio, satellites, and even the power grid .\nLocals enjoy the beautiful night sky Fortunately, many enjoyed the beautiful night sky without experiencing many disruptions.\nResidents across the US flooded social media with photos of the aurora borealis, from New York to Colorado and more.\nMany New Yorkers were stunned by the sight.\nOne on Reddit even said, “Never in a million years did I ever think that my first time seeing the northern lights would be here in New York City .”\nAnother Colorado resident also shared photos they took around their barn .\nSource: Facebook\nActor Simu Liu even posted photos of the Northern Lights he took aboard his flight.\nAlthough the northern hemisphere enjoyed its display of lights, people in the southern hemisphere were not left empty-handed either.\nAustralians also enjoyed their version called the aurora australis , or the Southern Lights.\nSource: 7NEWS Adelaide on Facebook\nAlso read: 9 white ‘beams’ seen in Japan amid Aurora sightings, resemble sci-fi anime\n9 white ‘beams’ seen in Japan amid Aurora sightings, resemble sci-fi anime\nHave news you must share?
