  "text": "Polk County Continues Recovery After Hurricane Milton (PCSO) POLK COUNTY, Fla. – The Florida Department of Health in Polk County (DOH-Polk) is urging residents to prioritize their health and safety as they navigate the aftermath of Hurricane Milton.\nThe department emphasizes the importance of vigilance and preventative measures to avoid potential health risks associated with flooding, contaminated water, and other post-storm hazards.\nFloodwater Precautions:\nFloodwaters can carry contaminants that pose significant health risks. DOH-Polk stresses the importance of avoiding contact with floodwater whenever possible. If contact is unavoidable, thorough handwashing with soap and disinfected water is crucial, especially before handling food, after using the restroom, and after participating in cleanup activities.\nREAD: UF/IFAS Needs Your Help To Assess Hurricane Milton’s Impact On Florida Agriculture\nAny open wounds exposed to floodwater should be cleaned immediately, and individuals should seek medical attention if signs of infection develop.\nVibrio vulnificus Awareness:\nDOH-Polk warns residents about the risk of Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in warm brackish water that can cause severe illness, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems or open wounds. Symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain should be reported to a healthcare professional immediately, especially if they occur after potential exposure to floodwater.\nCarbon Monoxide Safety:\nThe use of generators and other fuel-powered equipment indoors poses a serious risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. DOH-Polk reminds residents that these devices should only be operated outdoors in well-ventilated areas. Recognizing the symptoms of CO poisoning, such as headache, dizziness, and nausea, is critical. If CO poisoning is suspected, seek immediate medical attention.\nREAD: GasBuddy: A Must-Have App For Florida Drivers Battling Hurricane Milton Fuel Shortages\nMosquito Control:\nStanding water left behind by the storm provides ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, increasing the risk of mosquito-borne illnesses. Residents are encouraged to eliminate any standing water on their property and take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using repellent and wearing protective clothing.\nWater Safety:\nDOH-Polk advises residents to heed any boil water notices issued for their area. Water should be brought to a rolling boil for at least one minute before consumption or use in food preparation.\nWildlife and Animal Safety:\nDisplaced wildlife can pose a risk to residents in the aftermath of a hurricane. DOH-Polk recommends exercising caution around animals and seeking medical attention for any animal bites. All bites should also be reported to Polk County Animal Control.\nMold Prevention and Remediation:\nMold growth is a common concern after flooding. DOH-Polk provides guidance on proper mold cleanup and removal, emphasizing the importance of drying affected areas quickly and thoroughly. Individuals with respiratory conditions or compromised immune systems should avoid direct contact with mold.\nDOH-Polk remains committed to supporting the community’s health and well-being throughout the recovery process. Residents are encouraged to stay informed and follow safety guidelines to protect themselves and their families.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism .
