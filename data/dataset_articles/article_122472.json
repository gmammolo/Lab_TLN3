  "text": "CHAMPAIGN — When Ameren linemen from Illinois set out to assist in recovery from Hurricane Helene, they knew it would be a different animal from repairs back home. They didn’t know they’d be carrying their tools up mountains by hand and placing new poles by helicopter in northern Virginia. “People that lived on the mountainside … it’s family-owned ground, it seemed like it was generation after generation that had been there,” said lineman Curtis Hayes. “They all know each other.” Hayes worked to bring power back after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 but said the mountainous landscape this time around created totally different challenges, as sliding mud and water loosened entire trees that hit and broke power poles. Derek Rhodes wasn’t working at Ameren yet when Katrina hit, so this was his first hurricane response. Both typically work in the Champaign County area and were just some of the 125 Ameren personnel and 250 contractor personnel sent out east to help. “We did hear that they had maybe asked other crews and they said no,” Rhodes said of one of the first jobs their crew took on. “We heard this after we were up in the mountains. … We didn’t complain; we grabbed our stuff and started marching up there.” By “marching up there,” Rhodes means a mile-and-a-half climb up a mountain, bringing the crew to around 4,200 feet in elevation, where the air was thin enough to be noticeable. Once up there, they were digging poles out by hand in an area with no phone service ... which also meant no lunch drop-offs on 7 a.m.-to-11 p.m. work days. The crew worked on power lines for rural areas, typically serving scattered individual families. Both Hayes and Rhodes said they were impressed with the folks out in the mountains who never seemed to complain and were always willing to help. “They’re used to a simpler way of life out in the mountains,” Hayes said. “When we do storms in town, people think we’re just supposed to flip a switch and get their lights back on. These people, they were super helpful and kind of used to it.” People shared their vehicles in areas Ameren trucks couldn’t access or got a hold of their neighbors to make sure workers could get on their land. Others gathered at a school that had to be closed to cook all the food that would’ve been for the kids and offer it to work crews; they fed at least 250 crews one day. Finally back after a 10-day stint, the linemen are just waiting to see if they’ll be called on to help in the wake of Hurricane Milton.",
