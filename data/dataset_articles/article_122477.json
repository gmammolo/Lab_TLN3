  "text": "First Alert Forecast: Gorgeous weekend on the way Lots of sunshine, warm afternoons ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - A beautiful, Fall-like weekend is in store across North Georgia! After quite the cool morning in the 40s to mid 50s, temperatures will warm nicely this afternoon under sunny skies. Highs today will climb into the mid to upper 70s. Tomorrow will be a touch warmer, but we will continue to see lots of sun! After a chilly morning in the upper 40s to mid 50s, highs will climb into the low 80s Sunday afternoon. The upcoming week brings quite the cool down. In fact, a First Alert Weather Day is on the way Tuesday for the coldest temperatures since Mid May. Monday, highs will be in the mid 70s, but as a front moves in Monday night, temperatures quickly drop. Tuesday morning will be in the low 40s to near 50 across the area, but highs will only reach the mid to upper 60s. It will also be breezy, so be sure to have a slightly heavier jacket Tuesday. Highs will say in the 60s with morning lows anywhere from the upper 30s to low 40s Wednesday through Friday. No rain expected this week. Copyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",
