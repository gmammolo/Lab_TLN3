  "text": "SIESTA KEY, Florida (Reuters) - Chris Fiore was supposed to be accepting delivery of new household appliances and furniture, replacing items that were swamped by Hurricane Helene just a few weeks ago.\nInstead, the resident of Siesta Key, the Florida barrier island town where Hurricane Milton made landfall this week, was using a broom to push muck and seawater out of her ground-floor condo, a dream home she purchased just four years ago.\n\"There is no chance I'm pulling up stakes,\" Fiore said on Friday, pointing out the waterline where ocean water earlier this week was two feet (60 cm) up a wall. \"I'm doubling down, thinking about hurricane windows and doors, figuring out how to stop this water from coming in.\"\nThis sentiment was echoed by several residents of Siesta Key who spoke with Reuters on Friday. Residents were outnumbered by clean-up workers and people handing out cards advertising roofing and other construction services following two major hurricanes in two weeks.\nAll were feeling down from the double whammy of Helene and Milton. But no one seemed defeated, despite the threats of more and stronger hurricanes coming their way in the future.\n\"Paradise is still paradise, despite this mess,\" said Pat Hurst, who along with her husband Bill has lived on Siesta Key since 2011 and has been visiting for well over two decades.\n\"That said, cleaning up from one hurricane while trying to prepare for another was really stressful.\"\nWhile those living outside hurricane-prone zones may wonder why their residents choose to stay, it is easy to see Siesta Key's appeal, even after a hurricane. The place is a Jimmy Buffet song come to life. The mix of low-slung homes and three-story condos are painted in pleasant pastels, and downtown is lined with appealing restaurants and bars.\nAfter Milton, fine white beach sand covered roads several blocks inland. Homes were turned inside out, with every imaginable household possession ruined by Helene heaped along roads. Coconuts were blown from trees and thrown asunder.\nBoats normally docked in canals were tossed on land. Dumpsters already full from the Helene cleanup were being topped by Milton's debris.\nMilton, the fifth-most-intense Atlantic hurricane on record, intensified quickly from a Category 1 storm to the maximum Category 5 at sea in less than 24 hours, the latest example of a worrying trend that has seen storms growing more powerful, more quickly, due to climate change.\nMilton made landfall as a Category 3. At least 16 deaths were attributed to Milton, CBS News cited the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as saying.\nAsked by reporters about possible discussion of not letting people rebuild, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Friday that \"the reality is people work their whole lives to be able to live in environments that are really, really nice, and they have a right to make those decisions with their property as they see fit.\n\"It is not the role of government to forbid them or to force them to dispose or utilize their property in a way that they do not think is best for them,\" DeSantis said.\nSherry Tom, 49, convinced her husband and three daughters to leave Pittsburgh's cold winters and move to Siesta Key in 2021.\n\"This place is my whole heart,\" she said. \"But I will admit - I'm worried about living in fear that this will happen again. But if we can, we're staying.\"\nTom said she thinks that they will have to knock down what remains of their home and build from scratch. She wasn't certain how they will get that done, but was resolute about staying.\nMarko Radosavljevic, 54, owns one of the original homes built by Siesta Key's first developer, Frank Archibald. It's a coral green beauty built with pecky cypress wood, known for its water resistance. Water and wind have nonetheless done damage in the past two weeks.\nAs he worked to clean out debris from the house he's owned since 2017, Radosavljevic said that he was not even considering leaving behind a place \"with a special island vibe.\"\n\"I refuse to be pushed out,\" Radosavljevic said, referring to both storms and drives to put up hotels in place of the older homes like his.\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks; editing by Donna Bryson and Sandra Maler)\nBy Brad Brooks\nShare © Reuters - 2024",
