  "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Happy Saturday! We have another weekend full of fun events and several fall festivals across Central Alabama. The good news is that the weather will not be an issue for you. The big story in the short term is that temperatures will trend several degrees above average for afternoon highs. Significantly cooler air will return next week. Temperatures are a little chilly this morning with most of us starting out in the upper 40s and lower 50s. Temperatures are nearly three to five degrees cooler than at this time Friday morning. First Alert AccuTrack Satellite and Radar is showing us clear and dry. High pressure remains in place giving us plenty of sunshine this weekend. We are looking at temperatures climbing into the lower 80s this afternoon with a sunny sky. Winds today will likely come from the west at 5-10 mph. You’ll definitely want to grab the hat and sunglasses if you plan on being out today. I also recommend sunscreen if you plan on attending the Alabama football game at 11 a.m. CDT in Tuscaloosa. If you have any evening plans, we will remain clear and dry with temperatures cooling into the upper 60s and lower 70s by 7-8 p.m. CDT.\nFall Cooldown (wbrcnews) Very warm Sunday: We want to give you a first alert for very warm temperatures tomorrow afternoon! We will likely start tomorrow morning mostly clear with temperatures a little warmer than this morning in the mid 50s. We should end up sunny tomorrow afternoon with a few clouds possible to the north. Temperatures will likely trend 5-8 degrees above average with highs in the mid 80s. Upper 80s can’t be ruled out in far west Alabama. Winds will likely come from the southwest at 5-10 mph.\nOak Grove Fall Festival (wbrcnews) Next Big Thing: The big story next week is the arrival of a strong cold front Sunday night into Monday morning. This cold front will likely drop our temperatures below average for mid-October. Breezy conditions will be possible Sunday night into Monday as a cold front approaches the state. A stray shower can’t be ruled out early Monday morning, but I think the majority of us will remain dry. Temperatures will likely cool into the mid 70s Monday afternoon. It will end up even cooler Wednesday and Thursday with highs in the mid to upper 60s. You will likely need a coat or jacket on Wednesday and Thursday mornings with temperatures cooling into the lower 40s. It would not surprise me if we saw some upper 30s along and north of Hwy 278. Scattered frost will be a possibility for areas north of I-20. You may need to cover or bring any sensitive plants inside by the middle of next week. The upcoming week will remain dry and sunny. No sign of any rainfall over the next seven days.\nTropical Update (wbrcnews) Tropical Update: Tropical Storm Leslie continues to spin away in the Central Atlantic. Winds are at 50 mph as it rapidly pushes to the northeast at 20-25 mph. Leslie will not impact the United States. It will continue to push to the east-northeast and lose tropical characteristics over the next couple of days.\nWe are also watching a tropical wave in the far eastern Atlantic that is located a couple of hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Odds for development are up to 40% over the next couple of days. We will need to watch this system as it will likely move to the west and not curve out into the Atlantic. The next name up on the 2024 Atlantic hurricane list is “Nadine”.\nNo tropical systems are forecast to impact the United States over the next seven days. Hurricane season officially ends on December 1st.\nMake sure you download the WBRC First Alert Weather app on Android and Apple devices for the latest weather information.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.
