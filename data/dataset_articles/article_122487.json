  "text": "After shutting down ahead of Hurricane Milton, Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will welcome back guests on Oct. 11.\nIn a statement, Disney World said it was \"grateful\" that the park had weathered the storm and is \"currently assessing the impacts to our property.\" Disney initially plans to reopen theme parks and dining/shopping district Disney Springs this Friday, with other areas slated to follow.\nFor Walt Disney World visitors holding partially used multiday tickets, expiration dates will be extended to Oct. 11, 2025.\nUniversal Orlando Resort on Oct. 11 will restart normal operations for its theme parks and CityWalk. Universal is resuming its Halloween Horror Nights.\nGuests with tickets to visit Universal Studios or Islands of Adventure on Oct. 10, as well as those with tickets to visit waterpark Volcano Bay on Oct. 9 or Oct. 10, will be able to use those tickets to visit any day through Dec. 18, 2024.\nUnited Parks & Resorts said it will reopen the SeaWorld Orlando, Aquatica Orlando and Discovery Cove parks on Oct. 11, though SeaWorld's Spooktacular and Howl-O-Scream events remain canceled for Friday.\n\"We are grateful for our dedicated team of animal care experts, including veterinarians, who remained onsite during the storm to monitor the animals, and we appreciate our ambassadors who are onsite to help ensure our park is ready to welcome you,\" United Parks & Resorts said in a statement on its website.\nBusch Gardens Tampa, however, remains closed.
