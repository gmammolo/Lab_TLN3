  "text": "Dustin’s First Alert Forecast: A nice and warm weekend with plenty of sunshine Chillier temperatures next week Sunny skies and seasonable temperatures will kick off the weekend, just in time for Mumfest in New Bern. Highs will top out in the upper 70s on both days, with a light breeze from the southwest from 5-15 mph. Overnight lows will be in the upper 40s & 50s to the upper 50s to lower 60s. As we head into Monday, it will be the last of our warmth to linger around ENC. We could see a stray shower or sprinkle late in the day, but most will be dry, as it is part of a cold front, and this will usher in our first taste of fall-like air. Highs fall to the 60s and overnight lows back in the mid-40s. We will also see northwest breezes sustaining up to 15-20 mph and gusting up to 25-30 mph. Breezes will continue through Wednesday morning before calming down to a sustainable breeze from the north-northeast from 5-10 mph. By Thursday morning, a few areas could see frost to start the morning, as we could wake up in the upper 30s to lower 40s. Sensitive plants will need to be protected or brought indoors. More of the cooler airmass will linger into next weekend. Stay tuned to the latest tropical updates and local town forecasts on the WITN First Alert Weather App. Copyright 2024 WITN.
