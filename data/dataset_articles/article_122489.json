  "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - It’s a beautiful weekend with plenty of sunshine and warm but comfortable temperatures, starting out in the 60s south of the lake and the 50s north on Saturday.\nExpect afternoon highs to bounce into the low 80s. Make sure to keep the sunblock and sunglasses handy as you head out to a jam-packed weekend of activities. Sunday looks just as nice, with temperatures a smidge warmer.\nThe big story is looking ahead to our first real fall front. Ahead of the front Monday, compressional heating will allow it to get a bit warm, with highs bouncing back to near 90. It’s very dry, so no rain to speak of, but we will see even lower humidity. Temperatures will dip into the 70s for highs by midweek with some 40s for lows north of Lake Pontchartrain.\nThe chill won’t last long, with temperatures rebounding again by Friday.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
