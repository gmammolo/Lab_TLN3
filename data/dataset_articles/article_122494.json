  "text": "The sun will come out tomorrow and also today. The forecast for St. Albert and the wider Edmonton region for the weekend is full of clear skies and lovely temperatures, if Environment Canada is to be believed. Friday’s fall-ish high of 10 C and overnight low of just 1 C will be naught but a memory in a matter of hours. Clear, calm conditions that persisted overnight will pave the way for a decidedly seasonal Saturday, with a high expected to reach 14 C and clear conditions forecast all day Saturday and Sunday, for that matter. Saturday’s overnight low of 4 C will surrender to the sun on Sunday as the mercury climbs like a spawning salmon all the way through the teens to a high of 20 C. The overnight low of 5 C will set the stage for another lovely 21 C high on Monday, when ECCC expects the day to be dominated by a mix of sun and cloud, before overcast conditions bring the temperature back to earth mid-week. Precipitation could return to the region by Wednesday, when the ECCC forecast calls for a 60 per cent chance of showers.",
