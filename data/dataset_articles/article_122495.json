  "text": "CNN Host Struck by Flying Debris While Reporting on Hurricane Milton CNN’s on-ground reporter faced a terrifying incident while covering the chaos of Hurricane Milton, as debris flew into the camera’s shot during a live broadcast. This dramatic moment underscores the severe impact of the storm as it wreaked havoc across Florida.\nHurricane Milton Causes Devastating Damage in Florida With at least 17 confirmed deaths , Hurricane Milton has left a trail of destruction across the state of Florida. Experts warn that the risk of flooding persists, potentially lasting for “days to weeks.” Authorities are scrambling to assess the damage, particularly in the severely affected west-central region of the state.\nAs of early Saturday, approximately 1.8 million households remain without power, prompting over 50,000 utility workers to be deployed for restoration efforts, as confirmed by Governor Ron DeSantis.\nEnvironmental Impact A phosphate mine operator faced backlash after releasing thousands of gallons of pollutants into Tampa Bay due to overflowing drains during the storm.\nHurricane Milton’s Powerful Path Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm on Wednesday night, particularly affecting Sarasota County’s Siesta Key. The hurricane’s force spurred numerous tornadoes, created 28-ft waves, and produced heavy rainfall and severe storm surges.\nTragedies struck in a retirement community in St. Lucie County, where six lives were claimed after tornadoes surged through the area in a mere 20 minutes.\nSubstantial winds caused a crane to topple onto The Tampa Bay Times building in St. Petersburg, while the Tampa Bay Rays reported significant damage to the roof of their Tropicana Field stadium.\nStorm Outcome and Community Resilience As recovery and rescue operations continue, Florida’s communities are rallying together. Evacuations preceding the storm likely mitigated the potential death toll, with many recalling the devastation from Hurricane Helene just weeks prior, prompting widespread preparations for Milton.\nLocal Stories of Survival Florida residents, including Fred and Rita Neuman, reflected on their evacuation journey to the Panhandle. Living in Siesta Key, they chose safety after witnessing the terrifying power of Helene. “I love my house, but I’m not dying in it,” Fred stated as he faced the aftermath awaiting at home.\nIn nearby Palmetto, residents Lee and Pamela Essenburm took precautions as winds ravaged their backyard trees. “I wasn’t going to take a chance on it,” Lee expressed, showcasing the community’s proactive stance against such storms.\nFlorida Faces Ongoing Rescue Operations Rescue efforts are crucial as the full scope of Hurricane Milton’s impact becomes clearer. Authorities collaborate with local organizations on search and rescue missions for residents and their animals, including pets unexpectedly caught in the storm’s aftermath.\nEnviromental Observations As the state assesses the storm’s environmental aftermath, reports state the hurricane’s increased rainfall by 20 to 30 percent is attributable to the climate crisis. This includes an approximate 10 percent rise in winds due to humanitarian-driven warming. Experts highlighted the urgency of hurricane preparedness as storm frequency and intensity continue to rise.\nAerial Views of the Destruction Contrasts in safety remind families across Florida of daunting realities. Aerial footage showcases ravaged neighborhoods due to tornadoes as Hurricane Milton passed. This visual evidence underscores the need for expanded emergency measures and community recovery efforts.",
