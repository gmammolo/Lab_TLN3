Updated: 8:37 AM EDT Oct 12, 2024 WE’RE KICKING OFF THE WEEKEND ON A BEAUTIFUL NOTE. WE’VE GOT LOTS OF SUNSHINE AHEAD DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE. STILL BEING LOCKED IN. SO THAT’S CONTINUING THIS NICE DRY STRETCH OF WEATHER. EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED FOR THE MOST PART. NOW THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO MOST OF NEXT WEEK. LOOKING NICE AND DRY. THERE’S ONLY A SMALL CHANCE FOR A FEW SHOWERS DUE TO A COLD FRONT THAT WILL SWING ACROSS THE REGION AS WE MOVE ON INTO SUNDAY AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER, IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE IT’S GOING TO BRING MUCH MOISTURE WITH IT, WHICH IS ALSO GOOD NEWS FOR US. LOOKING AT OUR AFTERNOON HIGHS. COULDN’T ASK FOR BETTER WEATHER. CHILLY START TO THE MORNING, BUT AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL REBOUND INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S. SO OVERALL TEMPERATURES TODAY VERY SEASONABLE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. TOMORROW WE WILL BE BACK INTO THE LOWER 80S. SO A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER WITH OUR TEMPERATURES. BUT AS WE START TO GET ON INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THAT COLD FRONT SWINGS THROUGH SUNDAY INTO MONDAY, IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME FOR THAT COOLER AND COLDER AIR TO REALLY START TO WORK INTO THE REST OF THE REGION, SO WE’LL GET A TASTE OF IT ON MONDAY. HIGHS IN THE MID 70S. VERY SEASONABLE OVER AS WE MOVE INTO MONDAY NIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY. OUR TEMPERATURES DROP INTO A DROP IN A BIG WAY, DROPPING ABOUT TEN DEGREES FROM MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. REMAINING IN THE 60S THE REST OF THE WEEK FOR AFTERNOON HIGHS. AND THOSE OVERNIGHT LOWS. GETTING INTO THE 40S AND POTENTIALLY THE 30S. IN FACT, PARTS OF WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA COULD POSSIBLY SEE SOME FROST CONCERNS ACROSS THE REGION. SO WE WILL GET A TRUE TASTE OF FALL AS WE MOVE INTO NEXT WEEK. SO IF YOU’RE ANXIOUS FOR COOLER WEATHER, WE CERTAINLY HAVE THAT AHEAD. AS FAR AS THIS WEEKEND GOES, IT IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT ON THE WARMER SIDE COMPARED TO WHERE WE’VE BEEN LATELY, BUT BEAUTIFUL CONDITIONS ALL DAY LONG. GET OUTSIDE AND ENJOY THE SUNSHINE. IF YOU’RE TRYING TO GET THE KIDS OUTDOORS, MAYBE HEADED TO THE SWAMP RABBIT TRAILL. GREAT DAY TO DO SO. MOVING ON INTO SUNDAY. ALSO GOING TO BE NICE AND QUIET THROUGH THE DAYTIME. MIGHT WAKE UP TO SOME PATCHY FOG IN A FEW LOCATIONS AND THEN AS WE HEAD THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE MORNING ON SUNDAY, THAT FOG WILL BURN ON OFF AND THAT WILL MAKE WAY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES LATE IN THE DAY. SUNDAY. WE DO HAVE THAT COLD FRONT STARTING TO WORK ACROSS THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST, SO OUR WINDS ARE GOING TO BE SHIFTING FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND THEN INTO INTO MONDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THEY WILL SHIFT INTO THE NORTHWEST. THAT WILL BRING IN THAT COOLER AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THAT COLD FRONT. SO RIGHT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE NORTH CAROLINA LINE, WE COULD SEE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP. THAT SHOULD QUICKLY DISSIPATE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY, MAKING WAY FOR BEAUTIFUL CONDITIONS. THE REST OF THE WEEK. SO MONDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK, ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. TAKING A LOOK AT THE TROPICS THOUGH RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE TWO AREAS WE’RE WATCHING IN THE ATLANTIC, BUT NEITHER OF THESE ARE GOING TO POSE ANY IMPACTS TO THE U.S. OR THE CARIBBEAN. LESLIE STILL WORKING ITS WAY FAR TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. AND THIS DISTURBANCE OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA. INVEST 94 ELM. ALTHOUGH IT HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING INTO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION OR STORM THROUGHOUT, TODAY, IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE IT’S REALLY GOING TO AMOUNT TO MUCH AFTER THAT. IT SHOULD GRADUALLY FIZZLE ON OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC, POSING NO IMPACTS HERE AT HOME. JUST WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR. FOUR DAY LOOKS LIKE THIS. MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES THROUGHOUT THIS WEEKEND, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE BIT WARMER THIS WEEKEND. IT IS GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL NEXT WEEK. NICE AND DRY CONDITIONS STICKING AROUND, BUT OUR TEMPERATURES TAKING A BIT OF A TUMBLE, ESPECIALLY BY TUESDAY AND THEREAFTER HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 50S AND 60S AND THOSE OVERNIGHT LOWS DIPPING INTO THE 40S AND EVEN GET LOCAL BREAKING NEWS ALERTS The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox.\nYour Email Address Submit Privacy Notice Advertisement Coolest Air of the Season Next Week Share Copy Link Copy {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied!
