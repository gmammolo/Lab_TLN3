  "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) - Sunny skies for Saturday with afternoon highs in the low 80s with a light breeze out of the northeast. Chilly again overnight tonight into Sunday morning with temperatures dipping into the upper 40s to low 50s.\nSunny skies for Sunday with afternoon highs in the mid 80s. Monday will bring mostly sunny skies with toasty temperatures in the afternoon in the upper 80s to near 90.\nAnother cold front will move through our area on Tuesday. Perhaps an isolated shower pops up as the front moves through, but besides that most spots will stay dry. That cold front will bring our afternoon highs down into the 70s for Wednesday and Thursday. Morning lows on Wednesday will dip back into the low 50s, while Thursday morning will start in the 40s!\nIn the tropics, nothing is currently brewing in the Gulf or Caribbean. Reminder, hurricane season extends through the end of November, so we must continue to keep our eyes on things, even when it gets cold here!\nWatch the attached video for the full forecast:\nTo stay updated on all the latest forecasts and weather, follow WCTV First Alert Weather on Facebook and X ( Twitter ) .\nClick here to see all the latest weather headlines and here to view the First Alert Radar.
