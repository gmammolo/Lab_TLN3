  "text": "A Georgia woman is grateful for the 'divine intervention' after Hurricane Helene wiped out the entire first floor of her house, CRC Coffee House, but somehow her Bible was still left intact amidst the ruins. According to 62-year-old Cindy Cole, she was guided by a sound she believed was divine intervention that alerted her before the tragedy struck. While this happened in September, currently thousands of people in Florida are reeling under the impact of Hurricane Milton.The horrifying events of September 26 began like any other day for Cole who was asleep in her bed oblivious to the raging storm outside. However, at that point, just before the heavy winds started wreaking havoc and the lights turned off, a voice called out to Cole: “Get up! Change rooms in the house.”At the beginning, Cole assumed that it was only a voice in her head but she heard it time and again and decided to take action. Realising the urgency of the matter, she obeyed the orders and changed the location slightly. In less than five minutes a large tree from the neighbor’s yard fell in her bedroom and right onto the bed where she had been lying just a moment ago. 114172095 “I just knew it was the Lord spurring me on to find somewhere safe,” Cole stated, still bewildered by the turn of events. Once the storm died down, Cole made her way back to her bedroom to check for any losses. The sight was painful: her room was in utter disarray. All the furnishings were overturned, the glass windows broken, and pieces of trash everywhere. But in all the mess Cole found the unbelievable – her Bible, standing on the nightstand, completely unscathed by the chaos.\\\"In that moment, I saw the Bible, and I was like, wow! I mean I thought to myself, ‘Isn’t that still standing?’” ‘They say you can’t alter the word of god, she concluded’, pointing to the book. All this while the storm was raging across Georgia and the neighbouring states which led to 230 casualties and rendered entire towns lifeless. The fact that Cole is alive can only be termed as a miracle. “At some point in time, I had also been praying for protection and I have no doubt the Almighty protected me,” relates Cole who still continues to cherish that very message which saved her life. Hurricane Helene was a powerful tropical cyclone that affected many states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. 94335227",
