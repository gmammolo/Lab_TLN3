  "text": "Winds will gust on Sunday up to 25 & 30 mph at times with a warmer day ahead. KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - It’s a pleasant evening that’s ahead for us, some of you will want a light sweater as the evening moves along. Join us on the WVLT First Alert Weather app for iPhone or Android to stay informed on the go and between newscasts. We share custom videos, and you can receive our messages on the latest conditions and forecasts. WHAT TO EXPECT The sunshine fades away this evening leaves us with a crystal clear sky. A great evening to watch the Vols play at home or simply have a bonfire in the backyard. We’ll wake up on Sunday morning to temperature near 50. The clear skies give way early on Sunday morning to a few more clouds. LOOKING AHEAD There’s a mix of sun and clouds for Sunday and it is warmer. Temperatures on Sunday will reach near 83 for the afternoon. Also, hold onto your hats. The winds will be out of the southwest at 10-15 mph with some gusts near 25. That leads to the few showers we’ll have overnight into Monday morning. After midnight and before sunrise there will be a few stray storms that move through. We’ll pick up less than 10th of an inch. That sets us up for the next week. That cold front will cool us down as we struggle with highs to get out of the 60s. Your hint of fall is here! 60s for highs next week, lot of sunshine and clear skies allow for temperatures fall back to the 30s for morning lows. Some of you will want the trade out for a heavier jacket. Copyright 2024 WVLT. All rights reserved.",
