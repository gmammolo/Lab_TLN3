  "text": "Fantastic weekend weather, slightly cooler temperatures next week BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Today’s Outlook: Much of the same remains today as we start off our weekend with another cool morning in the low to mid 60s. Once again, expect temperatures to quickly warm to the low 90s by the afternoon underneath clear sunny skies. Today’s high should top out right around the 90 degrees. Temperatures should fall nicely into the low to mid 80s for LSU v. Ole Miss kickoff in Tiger Stadium. Clear skies remain and throughout the game allowing for temperatures will make their way down into the 70s, making for a cool and comfortable evening. The next fall front Daytime highs are still warm in the low 90s through Monday, which is above normal for this time of year. Another cold front looks to arrive on Tuesday, helping to usher in another round of dry and cool air from the north. High temperatures fall below normal, possibly as low as the upper 70s, and mornings as cool as the low 50s. Extended Outlook The stretch of pleasant sunny and dry days remains through the next work week. Afternoon temperatures stay in the low 90s through Monday ahead of our next fall front to help cool us down slightly below normal for the middle latter part of next week. Rain chances don’t come back into the forecast until beyond the next seven days into next weekend and early next week. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo.
