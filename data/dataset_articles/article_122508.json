  "text": "{p}{strong}From Nick Russo, Storm Team 10 Meteorologist:{/strong}{/p}{p}Clear and cold tonight with lows in the upper 20s as winds ease up. The winds pick back up on Sunday, resulting in a high fire danger again. A Red Flag Warning is in effect from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday across all of Southern New England. High temperatures Sunday will be a touch warmer in the upper 50s to near 60.

Not much rain is expected with that system, only around a quarter inch in most spots.{ }{/p}{p}Monday will be the warmest day of the week as sunshine returns and high temperatures reach the mid to upper 60s.
