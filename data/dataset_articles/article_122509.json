  "text": "The Northern Lights could be visible in Missouri for the second time this week. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center noted that a CME or Coronal Mass Ejection erupted from the Sun the night of October 8th. Forecasters expected the CME to arrive on Thursday, October 10th, and cause a strong to potentially severe geomagnetic storm . The exact strength of the CME won't be known until it is roughly 1 million miles from Earth when it's measured by the DSCOVR and ACE satellites. What we do know is that a strong geomagnetic storm noted as G3, is capable of producing the Northern Lights as far south as Illinois and Oregon. A severe geomagnetic storm or G4 would allow the aurora to be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California. Viewing as far south as Alabama would be most likely low on the horizon but further north into Missouri the chances of the aurora being visible overhead is higher. If the forecasted strength of a strong to severe storm continues your best chance of seeing the aurora will be by getting away from city lights as much as possible. Photos of the aurora will be best taken using long exposure mode. To do this on an iPhone you first open the camera app and turn on Live Photo mode. That is done by clicking the icon in the top right corner (vertical photos) or the top left corner (horizontal photos). Next, you want to then take a photo of the night sky. After taking a photo open the photo app and click on your recently taken photo. Once that is open, tap the \"live\" label in the top left corner and select \"long exposure\" from the options. After turning on \"long exposure\" mode your camera will display a yellow timer in the top left corner of your camera screen. On an Android phone, you will want to open the camera app and click the more option in the top right corner or bottom of the screen. Once that menu is open select the \"pro\" option and then where it says \"speed\" you want to select that. After opening the \"speed\" menu you want to then scroll the yellow bar to a number longer than 1/30th, look for whole numbers and not fractions. When taking a long exposure photo it is best to use a tripod as you want to limit the movement of your phone as much as possible.",
