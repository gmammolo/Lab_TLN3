  "text": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - As hurricane Milton ripped through the area, Shawn Schaper, his wife and their son hunkered down and hoped their choice to shelter in place was the right one. “Sleeping was off and on, pretty much minimalistic,” said Schaper. “You get the smacking noises, you get the faster speeds every so often and they would constantly keep you aware and awake.” Thursday morning, he surveyed the inside and outside of his home to find minimal damage. After checking in with neighbors and others in Florida, he says since living in the Tampa area, Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Debbie caused much more severe damage. “Last night we had some areas not set up for it that flooded a little bit, but as far as our neighborhood we just took some direct impact of winds,” said Schaper. And while his area was not under a mandatory evacuation, surrounding towns were. And he’s glad they stayed. “We would have put our self probably more in harm’s danger or made ourselves more vulnerable two different things that we couldn’t take into account whether having electricity and power and Internet somewhere else, or having food and things that we needed to survive. I mean, those are all guesstimates at that point in time,” said Schaper. The Schaper family only lost power for a few hours. While they did have a generator available, he says they were prepared enough to preserve the energy in their fridge and freezer in order to use it. Copyright 2024 KCRG. All rights reserved.",
