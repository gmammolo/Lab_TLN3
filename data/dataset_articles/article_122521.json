  "text": "Friday, October 11th 2024, 5:48 pm This weekend will be unseasonably warm! Keep this in mind if you are heading to Dallas for the OU game! A cold front will move in overnight into tomorrow morning. It'll make for a nice Sunday afternoon as temperatures drop to the 80s. Temperatures will drop into the 70s on Monday! What is the weather like this weekend? Today is going to be hot; a record is in jeopardy! Today's temperatures are resting in the mid to high 90s. The perfect day to stay inside and watch OU take on Texas. Temperatures cool off tonight as a cold front moves in across the state. A strong cold front arrives Sunday but temperatures will still be above average. The truly cool air moves in Monday and will bring real October temps back to Oklahoma. EMSA HEAT SAFETY TIPS -HYDRATION is key in preventing heat-related illness. Drink plenty of water or electrolyte replacement drinks several hours before and during long exposure to the summer heat. Wear light-colored, loose fitting clothing and a wide-brimmed hat if working outdoors, and take plenty of shade breaks. No alcohol or caffeine. If you do not have air conditioning, find a cooling station or public space (such as libraries or malls) during the day. Don’t limit your use of air conditioning. Use the buddy system if working outdoors and check on elderly neighbors. Keep a cellphone on you at all times when outdoors, including walking, running daily errands, yard work or sports and physical activity. Follow our meteorologists!
