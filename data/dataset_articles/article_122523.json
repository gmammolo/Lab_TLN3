A cold front drops our temperatures to chilly ranges next week.\nWarm weather for the weekend\nWarm weather and breezy skies are expected through the weekend. A cold front drops our temperatures to chilly ranges next week.\nHEAD TOWARDS THAT TIME FRAME. RIGHT NOW, KINGS ISLAND LOOKING LIVE HERE. LOOKS LIKE I’VE GOT A GOOD CROWD OUT THAT DIRECTION. THE FOUNTAINS ON AND THEY’RE IN FULL HAUNT MODE HERE. SO IF YOU’RE HEADING OUT TO THAT TONIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE A REALLY GOOD NIGHT. SHOULD HAVE SOME DECENT CROWDS. THE WEATHER LOOKS COMFORTABLE AND SKIES SHOULD BE CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY 61 DEGREES RIGHT NOW. SO A NICE MILD START TO THE DAY. AND THEN AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, TEMPERATURES START TO WARM UP AS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO HOLD TIGHT. SO WE’VE GOT A VERY SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT HERE. WE’VE GOT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHWEST OHIO ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. WE’RE NOT EXPECTING TO SEE ANY THUNDERSTORMS SHOWERS HERE TODAY. I THINK A FEW CLOUDS DROPPING IN AS WE GO THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. BUT ONCE THIS FINALLY GETS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA THAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW. THAT WILL ALLOW FOR SOME BREEZIER CONDITIONS. AND IT’S GOING TO MAKE THINGS FEEL PRETTY CHILLY AS WE HEAD INTO NEXT WEEK. TODAY WE GET 78 FOR THE HIGH WARM FEW CLOUDS, ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. AND THEN TONIGHT WE’RE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S. NOT QUITE AS CHILLY TONIGHT. I THINK A LOT OF US COMING UP JUST SHY OF 60 DEGREES. SO A NICER START TO TOMORROW PROBABLY WON’T NEED AS HEAVY OF A JACKET. AND THEN TOMORROW AFTERNOON SHORTS AND T SHIRT WEATHER. WE’LL HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY TO PARTLY SUNNY SKIES, BREEZY, POSSIBLY A SPRINKLE AS THAT COLD FRONT DROPS IN SO YOUR FUTURECAST TODAY IS GOING TO SHOW THAT SCATTERED CLOUD COVER AGAIN. NO RAIN. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT CLOUDS AT LEAST THROUGH SUNSET. MAYBE A FEW PASSING CLOUDS TONIGHT. WAKING UP TO SOME SUNSHINE TOMORROW. TIMES OF SCATTERED CLOUDS TOMORROW AFTERNOON WITH A BETTER SHOT AS YOU HEAD TOWARDS SUNDAY NIGHT, YOU MIGHT SEE 1 OR 2 SPRINKLES AS THIS FRONT IS APPROACHING, BUT I THINK WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO NOTICE MORE THE BREEZIER CONDITIONS AS WE GO THROUGH YOUR SUNDAY. SO WINDS TODAY, MAYBE AROUND 15MPH. A LITTLE BIT OF A BREEZE, BUT TOMORROW YOU’RE GOING TO NOTICE THE MORE GUSTS TO 20 TO 25MPH THROUGH THE MORNING, MAYBE UP TO 30 IN SOME CITIES, AS YOU HEAD TOWARDS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. SO HERE YOU ARE AT NOON, YOU CAN SEE SOME STRONGER SOUTHWEST WINDS. THOSE WILL BE WARMING WINDS FOR US. THEY WILL START TO DECREASE AS YOU HEAD TOWARDS SUNDAY NIGHT, BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE NORTHERLY WINDS TO RETURN AS YOU HEAD INTO MONDAY, AND THAT WILL MAKE THINGS FEEL PRETTY CHILLY FOR US AS WE HEAD THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEK. SO THE WARMTH DOES END SUNDAY. THAT’S GOING TO BE YOUR LAST DAY IN THE 80S. FOR A WHILE HERE, I WAS SAYING THIS EARLIER, YOU JUST DON’T KNOW HOW MANY MORE DAYS OF THOSE 80S YOU’RE GOING TO GET WHEN YOU START GETTING INTO MID LATE OCTOBER. SO ENJOY IT. WE’VE GOT THE WARMTH THROUGH THE AFTERNOON, BREEZY SKIES WHEN YOU’RE WATCHING THE BENGALS ON WLWT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, YOU’VE GOT GREAT WEATHER. TEMPERATURES JUST SHY OF 7050S FOR HIGHS AS YOU HEAD INTO TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE GOING TO START TO GET CHILLIER THROUGH THE MIDWEEK TOO. SO I THINK OUR BEST SHOT AT FROST IS GOING TO BE WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY MORNING AS LOWS DIP TO THE MIDDLE 30S. RIGHT NOW, I WOULD SAY PATCHY, JUST BASED ON WHERE THOSE OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE. BUT IF WE GET A LITTLE CHILLIER, MAY END\nAdvertisement\nWarm weather for the weekend\nWarm weather and breezy skies are expected through the weekend.
