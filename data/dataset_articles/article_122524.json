  "text": "Get ready for another very warm weekend across the state as highs climb well into the 70s and 80s just about statewide. A few places on the southeast plains will approach 90 degrees! Even the mountains are warm with highs well into the 60s as high as tree line. To put this into perspective, the average high in Denver for Oct. 12 is 67 degrees. Skies will be hazy in northern Colorado this weekend due to wildfire smoke coming from fires in Utah and Wyoming. We'll also see some afternoon clouds today with the approach of a weak, but dry, cold front. That front will cool us down a few degrees on Sunday. Here's a look ahead: SATURDAY: Very warm and breezy with afternoon clouds. Continued dry. High 81, low 46. SUNDAY: Still warm and dry but a touch cooler. High 75, low 45. MONDAY: Mostly sunny and very warm with a high around 80. Mostly clear at night, low 47. TUESDAY: Mostly sunny and warm, high 78. Mostly clear overnight, low 45. WEDNESDAY: Continued very warm with elevated fire danger, high 80. Partly cloudy overnight, low 48. THURSDAY: Breezy and still quite warm, high 78. Partly cloudy overnight, low 50. FRIDAY: Potentially turning cooler with a slight chance for afternoon rain showers, high 66. Cloudy overnight 35.",
