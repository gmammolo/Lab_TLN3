ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Oct. 12, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy Florida is continuing with power restoration in areas impacted by Hurricane Milton. Outages have decreased from over 1 million immediately post-storm to approximately 580,000 as of 12 p.m. ET today, Saturday, Oct. 12. The company recently issued estimated times of restoration for all storm-impacted customers who are able to receive power. Those in Brevard, Citrus, Hernando, Highlands, Lake, Marion, Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia counties will be restored by 11:59 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 13, and customers in Pinellas and Pasco counties will be restored by 11:59 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Oct. 15. \"It's only been a few days since Hurricane Milton tore through the state, leaving behind unimaginable destruction and more than a million of our customers without power,\" said Todd Fountain, Duke Energy Florida storm director. \"While we've already made significant restoration progress in that short time, we will not stop until we get the lights back on for all our customers.\" It is important to note that customers who experienced extensive damage or flooding may require additional time for restoration and some should be prepared for extended outages. Updates will be communicated as soon as possible. Customers who cannot receive power as a result of damage to the property's meter base, breaker panel or customer-owned electrical wiring should contact their local municipalities for guidance.
