  "text": "Today’s near-80-degree warmth gets even warmer tomorrow. A few mid- and high-level clouds move in tonight as breezes calm. Tomorrow, high temperatures may surpass 10 degrees above average but probably well short of any record high temperatures. We also turn noticeably breezy during the afternoon. Through Tonight: Breezes decrease as clouds increase slightly. It’s mainly clear with filtered moon and starlight and only an extremely low chance of a stray sprinkle. Temperatures bottom out in the low-to-mid-50s. View The Washington Post current weather Tomorrow (Sunday): We slowly turn breezy with mid-to-late-afternoon gusts from the south-southwest as high as 25 mph. Mainly sunny with high temperatures near 80 to mid-80s. Even if we get warm again later in October, it’s looking less likely with each passing week that mid-80s are attainable. Enjoy one last September-like day! Overnight, as our next cold front approaches with clouds, we have a slight shower or storm chance and temperatures barely falling toward the 60-degree mark or so. It’s borderline windy at times into Monday as high temperatures struggle to get a few degrees warmer than low temperatures. Much cooler November-like weather filters in during the workweek! See Ian Livingston's forecast through Tuesday . We’re on YouTube , Facebook , Instagram , & X . Allergens check (they’re behaving) Not bad looking in all four allergen categories! Our region currently has only low-level concentrations of trees, grasses, weeds and spores. Let me know if you’re still feeling problems from even these lower levels. Trees are well past their peak, as expected, when we look at a typical pollen profile over a year’s time. Grasses have had their secondary annual peak here in the fall, and appear poised to stay muted through the winter. Weeds had been tracking a bit higher and ahead of schedule in the spring and summer but have actually fallen below typical levels for autumn. Spores have been the most persistently bothersome this year, based on the data. Several times this year levels have poked above typical average peak levels!",
