  "text": "By Alex Calamia ,\n1 days ago\n\"\nIt's a gorgeous and mild Saturday with highs soaring into the 70s this afternoon under ample sunshine. Clear skies overnight will allow temperatures to drop to near 50 by Sunday morning, but it'll be another pleasant afternoon with highs in the 70s for most afternoons. The only downside to the weekend will be the breeze which could reach 20 mph at times. We'll also watch for more clouds on Sunday with a stray shower to the north. Rain is expected overnight Sunday and Monday morning along a cold front, but it is very scattered and light for most spots. The heaviest rain will occur to our north. Behind this is our coldest air of the season. The usual cool neighborhoods will see frost Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday with low temperatures in the low 40s for the rest of us. Sunshine will continue with no rain in the forecast through next weekend - aside from late Sunday and early Monday. TODAY: Sunny and warmer with highs in the mid 70s. A bit breezy. TONIGHT: Clear and cool with lows near 50. SUNDAY: Sun and clouds. Nice with highs near 70. Chance for a few light showers midday, mostly north. SUN NIGHT: Mostly cloudy with the chance of some showers. Lows in the upper 50s. MONDAY: Partly sunny and mild to start with showers. Then some sun in the afternoon with highs steady in the low to mid 60s. REST OF WEEK: Dry but chilly with highs only in the 50s on Tuesday and Wednesday and frost possible in rural and low-lying spots. \" Expand All Read in NewsBreak",
