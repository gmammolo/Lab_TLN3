ASHEVILLE, N.C. - Jansen and Travis Putnam had planned their dream wedding. They were set to get married at the iconic Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina , on Sept. 28, in front of 170 guests.\nThen, Tropical Storm Helene hit , and the couple found themselves stuck at the hotel: They had to tell their 170 guests the wedding would be canceled.\n\"We were on the grounds of the Biltmore Estate, so at that point they had pretty much informed us that it wasn’t safe to leave and it wasn’t safe for people to get on the grounds either, so people couldn’t come in,\" Jansen said in an interview with LiveNow from FOX .\nBut the Biltmore staff and other guests who couldn’t leave the estate weren’t going to let a storm hamper the couple’s big day, even if the hotel was without electricity and water.\nRELATED: Nearly 200 miles of historic Blue Ridge Parkway reopens in Appalachia following Helene\nOne of the staff members at the Biltmore got ordained just so she could marry them. They made a flower bouquet for the bride that was wrapped in napkins. A photographer who happened to also be stuck at the estate took photos for them on her iPhone.

Hotel guests and staff attended the impromptu ceremony.\nJansen and Travis Putnam (Moments by MCQ)\n\"Not only did people come together, but it looked so good when it did come together.
