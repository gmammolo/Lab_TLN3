  "text": "Panaji: While a well-marked low pressure area over eastcentral Arabian Sea and north Karnataka lay off Maharashtra coast, the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Panaji, issued a yellow warning at 4pm on Saturday, as some parts of Goa received some quantum of rainfall.The associated cyclonic circulation with this system is likely to move northwestward and intensify into a depression over the central Arabian Sea on Sunday.During this post-monsoon month, nine days produced less than 10mm rainfall. But the wettest 24-hour spell during this month so far yielded 132.4mm—103.1mm on Oct 9 and 29.3mm on Oct 8. This created a high surplus of 63.1%, as the post-monsoon total swelled to 145.1mm while the normal value is 88.9mm at this stage.The spell on Oct 9 of 103.1mm was perhaps the second highest 24-hour spell in Oct after 108mm was recorded by IMD on Oct 25, 2019. This was due to super cyclone Kyarr, which came close to 150km to 200km to Goa’s coast five years ago.During the 24 hours till Saturday morning, IMD recorded a state average rainfall of 1.4mm, as compared to 0.9mm and 0.8mm on Thursday and Friday.Canacona recorded the highest rainfall of 3.4mm, Sanguem 2.9mm, Mapusa 2mm and other centres on a lesser scale. Figures of four centres were not available.The yellow alert issued by IMD will continue till Oct 14.",
