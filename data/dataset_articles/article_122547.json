  "text": "Flip-flop weather has returned with a fantastic fall warm-up for the weekend. Skies will be sunny and highs will range from upper 70s Saturday to low 80s Sunday. It’s a perfect few days to put up Halloween decorations or head to the pumpkin patch.\nIf you want to see fall leaves, take a short drive to the Poconos or parts of the Lehigh Valley, where leaf colors reach moderate to high color.\nHigh pressure is the dominant feature of the region, keeping us dry and unseasonably warm on Saturday and Sunday.\nTable of Contents\nToggle\nBalmy for the birds Next week it will look more like November Here’s your seven-day forecast: More from CBS News Balmy for the birds\nThis means great weather for the Eagles game Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field. Kickoff Sunday is at 1:00 PM against the Cleveland Browns and conditions will be in the mid-70s under mostly sunny skies.\nBy Sunday evening, the aforementioned low-pressure system will sweep its associated cold front across the region, bringing a slight chance of a few stray showers across the region into early Monday morning. At this point, it looks like the slight chance of rain will disappear from the region Monday morning for the commute.\nClouds will approach Sunday evening, followed by a cold front from the west. That front could bring some isolated showers and a few thunderstorms Sunday night and Monday morning.\nNext week it will look more like November You’ll need to find the fall coat on Monday as the coldest air so far this season arrives behind the cold front. Highs will struggle to reach the mid to upper 50s on Tuesday. Our average high this time of year is in the upper 60s, but the next week will be cooler than average.\nThis will also be a very dry and sunny week with a mix of sun and cloud on Monday, and sunny Monday afternoon through Friday.\nCBS Philadelphia\nThings will be a bit cooler on Wednesday as low temperatures bottom out in the low 40s, with highs only in the mid 50s. The last time the Philadelphia area had high temperatures in the 50s was on May 12, when the high temperature was 56 degrees. The average first day that temperatures stay in the 50s is October 10. This real sample of autumn comes at exactly the right time.\nThese conditions will not help with the rapidly approaching moderate and even severe drought for parts of the area.\nHere’s your seven-day forecast:\nCBS Philadelphia\nSaturday: Sunny. High 76, low 53.\nSunday: Warmer. High 79, low 54.\nMonday: Cooler. High 66, low 60.\nTuesday: Cold, sunny. High 59, low 44.\nWednesday: Cool, sunny. High 58, low 44.\nThursday: Mostly sunny. High 62, low 43.\nFriday: Mostly sunny. High 67, low 45.\nNEXT Weather radars\nHourly forecast\nMore from CBS News",
