  "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. — Saturday's weather will be clear and calm, thanks to high pressure hanging around our area. Expect a dry, sunny day with no significant weather events. Daytime highs will reach the upper 70s to around 80 degrees. Looking ahead to Sunday and Monday, dry weather will continue, but temperatures will rise above normal. Sunday will be quite warm, with afternoon highs in the mid-80s. From overnight into Monday, temperatures will be mild, staying in the low 60s. By Monday afternoon, as cooler air arrives, highs will fall into the mid-80s: 83. A cold front will move through Monday morning, bringing colder air by the evening. Expect colder nighttime lows, dipping into the 40s. Here is some exciting news: For Saturday, the weather at the South Carolina State Fair in Columbia looks ideal. Expect sunny skies with temperatures rising to a pleasant high in the upper 70s by the afternoon. Winds will be light, making it a comfortable day to enjoy the fair. As evening approaches, temperatures will cool back down, so it's a good idea to bring a light jacket if you'll be staying later. No rain is expected, so it should be a perfect day to explore all the attractions.",
