  "text": "SEBASTIAN, Fla. — Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) crews have arrived in Central Florida to assist in restoring power following the devastation of Hurricane Milton. The crews are part of a large-scale mutual-assistance effort involving more than 50,000 workers from 43 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada, according to the Edison Electric Institute. Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Fla., as a Category 3 storm and left at least 16 people dead and caused widespread damage, including dangerous storm surges, strong winds, heavy rains and flooding. The storm also spawned at least 36 confirmed tornadoes. As of Friday, PG&E said more than 2 million customers in Florida were without power, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) reporting about 680,000 outages. PG&E's base camp is set up at the Sebastian airport, located on the Atlantic Coast between Cape Canaveral and West Palm Beach. PG&E said crews are tasked with replacing broken power poles, cross-arms and installing new transformers and power lines. PG&E said crews are working to restore 13 circuits serving approximately 27,000 customers. Bobby Severson, incident commander of PG&E’s deployment, said, \"We left California a week ago, heading to Georgia to help utility customers there after Hurricane Helene. We are now in a different state responding to the damage from a different hurricane, but our mission to safely restore power to customers who need it as a first step to getting their lives back in order remains the same.\" The PG&E team, consisting of 400 workers and 300 vehicles, initially traveled to Georgia to assist with restoration efforts following Hurricane Helene. After completing their work in Georgia, PG&E said they moved to Florida to prepare for Hurricane Milton. Gavin Salcido, a general construction worker with PG&E, shared his experience from a previous mutual-assistance mission after Superstorm Sandy. \"It was very rewarding,\" he said. \"The people who we helped, you could tell they didn’t have much, but they were there and brought us coffee. And when we did get the power back on, they were so grateful.\" -- To report errors or issues with this article please[ email](mailto:comments@krcrtv.com?subject=Story%20Issues) the editorial team.",
