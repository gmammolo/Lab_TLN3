  "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - With winds flipping back out of the southwest our temperatures will be on the rise the next couple days with highs in the 80s Sunday and Monday. First Alert Weather Headlines: - Another cool night with lows in the 40s. - Highs for Sunday and Monday rebound to the 80s. - Temps tumble back down Tuesday with highs near 70 degrees. First Alert Weather Summary It was a gorgeous start to the weekend with bright sunny skies warming highs into the upper 70s. Once the sun goes down our temperatures will cool off quickly again as lows will drop into the mid to upper 40s for the Midlands. Sunday will continue the warming trend for the Carolinas as high pressure slides off to the east, out into the Atlantic, causing our winds to now come out of the southwest pumping in warming air to the region as highs will climb to the low to mid 80s. But it will be another great day to head out to the South Carolina State Fair as we will have sunny skies and low humidity levels. Monday will be another warm day with highs in the 80s under mostly sunny skies. Late Monday into Tuesday a strong cold front sweeps through the Carolinas ushering in a blast of cool, Canadian air. Highs Tuesday through Friday will be below average in the 60s to lower 70s. It will also get quite cold first thing in the mornings with lows dipping down into the lower 40s with some rural locations maybe falling into the upper 30s. Also the dry conditions look to continue for the Midlands as it has now been 15 days since our last day with rain and looking ahead we are not tracking any rain chances over the next 10 days so we could be looking at a completely dry October. First Alert Weather Forecast Tonight: Clear and cool with lows in the mid to upper 40s. Sunday: Sunshine continues and warmer. Highs in the mid-80s. Monday: Mostly sunny skies. Warm, with highs in the low to mid-80s. Tuesday: A few passing clouds. Cooler, with highs nearing 70 degrees. Wednesday: More sunshine but cool with highs in the mid-60s. Morning lows in the lower 40s. Thursday: Another sunny but cool day with highs in the 60s after starting out in the lower 40s. Feel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.
