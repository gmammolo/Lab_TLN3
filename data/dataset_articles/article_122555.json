  "text": "Preparation is key — that is the message that the Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) wants Australians to know ahead of a “severe weather season” filled with cyclones , thunderstorms, flooding, heatwaves, and fires .\nMeteorologists expect there will be about 11 tropical cyclones across the Australian region this year, and predict that due to warmer ocean temperatures, they are likely to be stronger than average.\nBetween October and April is the peak season for extreme weather in Australia , but cyclone season kicks off in November and the first cyclone of the season generally hits the coast from December onwards.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nOf the 11 cyclones expected in the region — which also includes Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia — only four are expected to cross the Australian coastline.\nBut because of climate change, it is not just cyclone strength at a heightened risk of increasing.\nMillions evacuated as once-in-a-century storm strengthens 3 min read\nDire warning as Great Barrier Reef water temperature hits 400-year high: ‘In danger’ 2 min read\nStorm surges — powerful ocean movements caused by wind action and low pressure on the ocean’s surface — can also be caused by cyclones.\n“Storm surge, including from cyclones that don’t make landfall, is a major hazard to coastal communities,” BoM said.\n“These impacts can extend beyond the tropics into the southern parts of Australia.\n“Due to rising sea levels, the risk of storm surge from tropical cyclones is likely to continue to increase.”\nBoM national community information manager Andrea Peace said the cyclones also brought additional dangers such as flooding.\n“Any tropical cyclone can be dangerous, and it only takes one to significantly impact communities. Last year we had eight tropical cyclones across northern Australian waters.\n“Four crossed our coast, bringing damaging winds and heavy rainfall, leading to flooding.”\nLong-term average number of tropical cyclones, using data from the 1969–70 season to the most recent season. Credit: BoM Thunderstorms and flash flooding Heavy rainfall, damaging winds, large hail and the risk of flooding across Australia are all set to ramp up in the coming months as the warmer weather brings more severe thunderstorms, BoM said.\nThe east coast, including Northern NSW and southern QLD, has the highest risk of severe thunderstorms.\n“There’s also a significant risk through inland Western Australia and across the tropical north during the wet season,” BoM said.\nThe bureau warned that flash flooding and riverine flooding was also more common for the upcoming season, particularly across the northern and eastern parts of the country.\nHeatwaves and fires The Bureau released a heatwave warning this last week for northwestern sections of Australia, but it said on Tuesday that more dangerous stretches of sweltering heat are expected, as is an early start to fire season.\n“Severe heatwaves can be dangerous for many people, especially older people, babies, children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, people with medical conditions and people who are unwell,” BoM said.\nBut aside from the related health impacts, heatwaves can also lead to an uptick in “dangerous and destructive fires”.\n“Fire authorities are advising an increased fire risk in the spring months for parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, western Victoria and southeast South Australia,” Peace added.\n“They also advise a potential early start to the fire season in parts of South Australia and Victoria, and extending to Tasmania, if there are warm and dry conditions leading into summer.”\nBoM urged Australians to prepare their homes and properties, review and update their emergency plans and create their emergency kits.\n“Severe weather can develop quickly and threaten lives and property. Now is the time to prepare,” it said.\n“The local emergency authority in each state and territory provides advice on how to prepare.”\nThe planet has experienced its hottest day on record: ‘Truly staggering’ 2 min read\nTens of thousands of birds dropped dead after crashing into one building 4 min read\nStream free on\nNews BOM Cyclones Fires Severe Weather Sponsored Content Weather",
