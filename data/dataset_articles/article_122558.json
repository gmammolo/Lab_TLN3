  "text": "A pleasant weekend is in store for us, with mostly sunny skies and highs some 10 degrees or so above normal. Our average high for Oct. 12 is 65 degrees, with the record in 1991 at 86 degrees. The record high for Oct. 13 was 85 degrees in 2022. As you can see, it can still get quite warm at this time of the year, but there appear to be no record highs in our near future.\nEnjoy the nice weather, as clouds will increase on Monday and a series of storms will usher in autumn rains the remainder of next week. These will be typical soaking fall rains, and rain will be noted for several days in a row. That hasn’t occurred since May or early June. Will it be the official start of the rainy season? Perhaps.\nMost forecast charts indicate a shift in the weather pattern globally, so we may finally be into the wet season. Not to say we won’t have some periods of dry and mild weather, but it’s time, don’t you think? With dense clouds and rain later next week, I expect high temperatures to struggle to reach 60 degrees, which is commonplace with fall rainstorms.\nColder air will follow in the path of these storms, and the higher ski areas on Mount Hood will receive some snow, perhaps half a foot by the end of the week. But remember the old saying: October snows come and go. I’m sure it will be a while before we begin the annual snowpack gains signaling the start of the ski season. We have a great chance to ski for Thanksgiving weekend this year.",
