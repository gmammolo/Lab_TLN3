  "text": "Beautiful Sunday weather! A big drop in temperatures next week! BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - It’s going to be a warm, sunny end to your workweek! Temperatures will remain above normal on Sunday with lows in the 60s and highs in mid-upper 80s and low 90s. Next week’s weather looks a bit interesting for south Louisiana! Warm weather is expected to continue through early next week until a cold front moves through the region on Tuesday. This will bring cooler temperatures to the region with highs in the 70s on Wednesday and Thursday! This will be a dry cold front, so rain is not in the forecast. Temperatures should return to normal, in the low 80s, by the end of next week. [Click here](mailto:typo@wafb.com) to report a typo. Please include the headline.
