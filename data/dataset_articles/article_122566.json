  "text": "(Boursier.com) — Phew of relief for the reinsurance sector. Large European groups such as Swiss Re and Munich Re are making progress on the stock market as Hurricane Milton moved away from the coast of eastern Florida after making landfall near Tampa. Experts estimate that the cost of the natural disaster could be lower than initially feared, as the strength of the hurricane had diminished before making landfall.\n“Reinsurers’ fears that Hurricane Milton could result in losses of more than $100 billion could be allayed, with losses potentially lower than the $60 billion incurred during Hurricane Ian in 2022, which “Milton moved to Category 3 before landfall,” said Charles Graham, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Abid Hussain, an analyst at Panmure Liberum, says that although it is too early for loss estimates, it will probably be a loss of less than $50 billion for the insurance sector. “Milton could be one of the most destructive hurricanes ever recorded in west-central Florida,” warned the United States National Hurricane Center (NHC).\nIn Paris, the Score rises 2.4% to 20.5 euros.\n©2024 Boursier.com",
