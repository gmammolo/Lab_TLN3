  "text": "If you’re disappointed that you missed earlier northern lights displays —or lucky enough to have caught a few—this weekend could be another treat!\nA strong G4-level geomagnetic storm is expected from Oct. 10 to 12, which could create a stunning aurora borealis show across Canada, including parts of southern Ontario, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe Canadian Space Agency shared a post on social media noting that “auroras will likely be visible across Canada as night falls,” suggesting that dark-sky locations in southern Ontario, like conservation areas around Hamilton, Milton and along Lake Ontario, may provide the best views.\nFor the best chance to catch the northern lights, make sure skies are clear before heading out between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., for optimal viewing conditions across the GTA.\nHowever, Environment Canada predicts that Saturday and Sunday night skies are expected to be mostly overcast, which could obstruct the spectacular event.\nThis highly anticipated display follows an active season of auroras , with views reaching much farther south than usual in recent months, including last weekend.\nAs the solar cycle nears its peak between late 2024 and early 2025, more chances to see the northern lights may be on the horizon, if solar activity remains high.",
