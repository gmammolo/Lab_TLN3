  "text": "Warm temperatures have continued into the weekend as we saw the mid 80s this afternoon. Paired with that was abundant sunshine which made for a perfect Saturday outside. These above average temperatures and clear conditions will continue into our Sunday. High pressure will keep us dry and keep those skies clear if anyone is planning on heading to the park or the pumpkin patch. Temperatures will start in the upper 50s and rise into the upper 80s and maybe even low 90s for some of us. This is abnormally warm for this time of year, but that'll change quickly into the work week. A cold front will move through the area Monday morning causing those temperatures to change as soon as that afternoon. High temperatures for Monday will be in the low to mid 70s. Much more like what we'd expect this time of year. The cold front will be a dry front, so no rain and barely even any clouds are expected for the start of our work week. As the week continues, the temperatures get colder and colder. By midweek, our high temperatures will only be in the mid 60s and low temperatures will be in the low 40s with some of us seeing the upper 30s. It may be time to check on those heaters if you haven't already.",
