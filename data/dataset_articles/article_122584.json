  "text": "Homeowner Pedro Casares of Orlando strapped down his family home to try and save it from Hurricane Milton as it made landfall as a Category 3 storm. Casares reportedly spent US$22,000 (AU$ 32,590) on the cement anchors and made-to-order straps that lined the roof of the home. In addition to the straps, the family also boarded up windows, The idea came to Casares after the family had endured a hurricane while living in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, and the aluminium roof of their home almost flew off. Casares’ daughter took to TikTok to share the state of the house after the storm. [@simplyuniquesmiles93]We made it through our second Hurricane and we are blessed to have no crazy damages to rhe home. My prayers still continue to those heavily affected during this time. Me and my dad are about to drive to see if anyone needs help🙏🏼🏠[#HurricaneMilton][#CentralFL][#Orlando][#FLhomegoesviral][#homestrappeddown][#homedepot][#lowes][#USCC][#cargocontrolstraps][#acehardware][#CNN][#wash2news][#spectrumnews][#telemundo][#univision][#dailymail][#abcnews][#ukradiostation][♬ Inspirational - neozilla] “The house, thankfully, we’re good. There are just a lot of leaves everywhere, but everything is still intact. There’s a lot of affected areas near our home,” she said in the video. “The home is intact. Not a single shingle nor tile has lifted from the roof. Everything is good. We’re not taking the straps off until the hurricane is over!” she added. Millions are still without power in Florida, while flooding still remind a threat along rivers in the area.",
