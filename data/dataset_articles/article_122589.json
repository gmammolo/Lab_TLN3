  "text": "Breezy and feeling like fall to wrap up the weekend\nTemperatures will feel a good bit cooler throughout the region today, with a northwest wind keeping temperatures in the 50s this afternoon.\nToday looks to be a cloudy fall day across southeast Minnesota, as we get the wind blowing in out of the northwest this morning giving a good rustle to the leaves throughout the region. Winds will pick up to 20-30 mph throughout the afternoon, and with the clouds lingering about, highs will struggle to make it much above 50° today.\nTonight lows will dip down into the 30s for much of the region, with a few spots further to the north dropping down below freezing. Throughout the day tomorrow highs will be cool once again, with a few clouds passing on through and highs topping out in the low 50s. Tuesday we see overnight lows dropping towards freezing yet again, and throughout the day highs will only warm up into the low 50s despite rather sunny skies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMidweek, we are keeping an eye on another brief warm-up with a stretch of 60s and 70s for the region through Friday, but that stretch looks to be short lived, as showers and seasonable temperatures return heading into next weekend.\nADVERTISEMENT",
