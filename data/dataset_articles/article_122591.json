  "text": "Happy fall warm-up in Philadelphia this Sunday. Here’s the full forecast.\nHappy fall warm-up in Philadelphia this Sunday. Here’s the full forecast.\n03:31\nFlip-flop weather has returned with a fantastic fall warm-up for the weekend.\nSkies will be sunny and highs will range from the upper 70s on Saturday to the low 80s on Sunday. It’s a perfect few days to put up Halloween decorations or go to the pumpkin patch .\nIf so leaves fall you want to see, take a short drive to the Poconos and parts of the Lehigh Valley where leaf colors reach moderate to high color.\nCBS News Philadelphia.\nHigh pressure is the dominant feature of the region, keeping us dry and unseasonably warm on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday evening, cloud fields will move in from the west ahead of a cold front. That front could bring some isolated showers and a few thunderstorms Sunday night and Monday morning.\nYou’ll need to find the fall coat on Monday as this season’s coldest air arrives behind the cold front. Highs will struggle to reach the mid to upper 50s on Tuesday. Our average high this time of year is in the upper 60s, but the next week will be cooler than average.\nCBS News Philadelphia.\nThis will also be a very dry and sunny week with a mix of sun and cloud on Monday, and sunny from Monday afternoon to Friday.\nThese conditions will not help the rapid development of a moderate and even severe drought in parts of the area.\nHere’s your seven-day forecast:\nCBS News Philadelphia.\nSunday: Sunny and warm. High 81, low 53.\nMonday: Sun with some clouds. High 65, low 60.\nTuesday: It’s getting chilly. High 59, low 43.\nWednesday: Sunny and cool. High 57, low 41.\nThursday: Sunny and cool. High 61, low 39.\nFriday: Sunny and seasonal. High 68, low 39.\nSaturday: Warm up. High 70, low 42.\nNEXT Weather radars\nHourly forecast",
