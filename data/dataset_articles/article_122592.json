This weekend will be warmer-than-usual. The workweek will mark a dramatic cool-down with chances for lowland rain, mountain snow and breezy weather at times.\nThis weekend will feature morning fog with stunning afternoon sunshine. Highs will jump to the upper 60s – low 70s. For perspective: the normal high for today at Sea-Tac Airport is 62.\nTemperatures in Seattle will rise to the upper 60s on Saturday. (FOX 13 Seattle)\nHighs in the greater Seattle area will boost to the upper 60s and low 70s on Saturday. (FOX 13 Seattle)\nMonday will be mostly cloudy with showers and slightly cooler temperatures.\nAn atmospheric river (a corridor of moist air in the atmosphere) will spark more rounds of rain on Tuesday.\nHighs will cool to the mid 60s in Seattle on Monday after a warmer-than-normal weekend. (FOX 13 Seattle)\nWednesday currently looks like the busiest day of weather this week. It’ll be blustery with times of wet weather. Mountain snow is possible on Wednesday and Thursday. There could be snowflakes flying as low as the elevation of Stevens Pass, but accumulations at 4,000 feet are unlikely.\nThe highest peaks of the Cascades and Olympics could experience accumulating snow! You’ll notice temperatures dropping in a big way, too.\nRiver levels will be rising this week due to the soggy weather pattern; however, we don’t expect flooding at this time.\nThere may be rain for the Seattle Reign game on Friday.\nHighs in Seattle will cool to the 50s during the workweek.
