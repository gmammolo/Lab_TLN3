  "text": "New Delhi: For about a week now, the Comet C\\/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) has been moving towards the Sun, showing up in images captured by heliophysics observatories, and has made its closest approach to the Earth on 12 October. For about a week now, the comet is expected to be visible to the naked eye. The comet is a rare sight as it only visits the Sun about once every 80,000 years, and has travelled from the outer reaches of the Solar System. The ancient comet is from the Oort Cloud, and was discovered in 2023. Tsuchinshan means 'Purple Mountain', and was named after the Tsuchinshan observatory in China and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) instrument in South Africa, that discovered the comet together. The closest approach to the Sun occurred on 27 September. Scientists expected the comet to break up and fragment during the close encounter, but the comet has survived. The comet will be moving through the constellations of Sagittarius and Scorpio, and is better observed from the southern hemisphere. In the future, the comet may be shot out of the Solar System entirely, because of the gravitational influence of the gas giants. Will Comet C\\/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) be visible from India? Yes, the comet will be visible from India for about a week to the naked eye, with the best time for observing between 14 and 24 October. The tail of the comet will be well-illuminated by sunlight, and it will be rising earlier in the evening every day. The comet will be visible shortly after sunset. The visibility conditions in individual cities is hard to predict, especially because of varying levels of pollution. It is better to head out to remote regions with minimal air and light pollution to observe the comet. The comet will be visible towards the west, shortly after sunset.",
