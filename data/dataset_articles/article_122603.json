  "text": "Scotland is currently experiencing chilly conditions , with a blast of polar air expected to persist over the weekend. Snow is even forecasted to blanket northern parts of the country as the first signs of winter emerge. However, next week could bring a stark contrast in weather, with parts of Scotland set to bask in an 'Indian summer' . Weather maps indicate temperatures creeping into double figures across the nation. WXCharts has identified five areas where temperatures will soar around 50% above the October average. Thursday, October 17 is predicted to be the warmest day of the month, particularly in southern parts of the UK where temperatures could reach 20C. Even in Scotland, it will feel mild. Dundee is anticipated to be the hotspot with temperatures hitting 16C. And 15C will be experienced in the Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders areas near the border with England. Aberdeen and Perthshire will also enjoy warmth with temperatures around 14 or 15C, reports the Scottish Daily Express . Thursday is also expected to be dry in the east of the country, according to WXCharts. While those five areas will be the hotspots, places like Edinburgh and East Lothian will also feel pleasant if the charts are accurate. The Cairngorms will be the coldest place in the UK, but even there temperatures will reach 10C, the average daytime temperature for October. The warmer conditions should persist into Friday before things return to normal for the weekend.

In a separate forecast, the Met Office has predicted that \"low pressure to the west will become increasingly influential\" by the middle of next week. This could bring \"an increased chance of rain, showers and perhaps strong winds, especially in the west or northwest\". However, it does agree with WXCharts on the possibility of warmer weather, stating: \"With winds from a southerly direction at first, temperatures will likely trend above average, with some warm conditions possible at times,\" before a return to cooler temperatures.",
