  "text": "By Sarah Ping ,\n46 minutes ago The Northern Lights have lit up skies in bright pink and faint green hues over England (Ella Pickover/PA) Ella Pickover/PA The Northern Lights have lit up the skies with bright pink hues visible on Thursday.\nPhotos of the dazzling natural phenomenon, also known as aurora borealis, were captured across England .\nThe lights could be seen as far south as Kent and East Anglia , and were also spotted further north in Lancaster by Professor Jim Wild, 49, who captured the Northern Lights from his back garden.\nA resident of Cromer, Norfolk, captured the Northern Lights as it lit up skies over their home (Walking Tractor/PA) The academic, who researches the aurora and space weather at Lancaster University, told the PA news agency: “My research focuses on the physics of the connections between the Sun and the Earth.\n“Over the years, I’ve been to the Arctic Circle several times to make measurements of the aurora, but it’s really special to see the northern lights from your back garden with your whole family.”\nProfessor Jim Wild from Lancaster captured the green hues of the Northern Lights which lit up the skies above his home town (Jim Wild) The Met Office said relatively clear skies were forecast for much of the UK, creating a “decent chance of visibility”.\nA spokesman for the forecaster said there had been “more space weather events in recent months”, including the Northern Lights, because the sun was nearing the peak of its solar cycle.\nThe Northern Lights on display in the skies over Great Chart Church, Ashford, Kent (Gareth Fuller/PA) (PA Wire) Met Office spokesman Stephen Dixon said there was a chance of some visible auroras across parts of the UK on Thursday night and into the early hours of Friday.\nThe auroras on Earth, which are most commonly seen over high polar latitudes but can spread south, are chiefly influenced by geomagnetic storms which originate from activity on the Sun.\nThe Northern Lights on display in the skies over Rushmere St Andrew (Joe Pickover/PA) (PA Wire) The sun works on a cycle of around 11 years called the solar cycle – with peak sunspot activity on the surface of the Sun referred to as solar maximum.\nSunspots give the potential for Earth-directed releases of large bursts of energy, called coronal mass ejections, which can lead to aurora visibility.\nAurora displays occur when charged particles collide with gases in the Earth’s atmosphere around the magnetic poles.\nAs they collide, light is emitted at various wavelengths, creating colourful displays in the sky.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
