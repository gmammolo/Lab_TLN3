  "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Good morning and happy Sunday! Temperatures are slightly warmer compared to Saturday morning. Most of us are starting out in the low to mid 50s. I recommend a light jacket for the morning hours. By 10-11 a.m. CDT, you’ll likely won’t need it as temperatures rapidly warm into the 70s. First Alert AccuTrack Satellite and Radar is showing us clear and dry. High pressure is moving off to the east and will provide us with a southwest wind today at 5-10 mph with gusts up to 15 mph. The southerly component to the wind will warm us into the mid 80s this afternoon. It is possible that parts of west Alabama could warm into the mid to upper 80s. Temperatures this afternoon will likely end up five to ten degrees above average for October 13th. I doubt we will tie or break any record highs this afternoon. Most of the records are around 89°F-90°F. We will likely remain sunny this afternoon with a few clouds possible late this evening and tonight as a cold front approaches Central Alabama. If you have any evening plans, we should remain mostly clear with temperatures cooling into the lower 70s by 7 p.m. CDT. It’ll be perfect weather to cheer on Legion Soccer this evening at Protective Stadium.\nBarber Vintage Festival (wbrcnews) Cooling down Monday: We want to give everyone a first alert for cooler temperatures Monday afternoon! A cold front will move through Alabama tonight into Monday morning. We may see a few clouds move through early Monday morning, but we will likely see plenty of sunshine and blue sky in the afternoon hours. Temperatures will likely start out in the upper 50s tomorrow morning. Monday will likely end up cooler than today with highs in the low to mid 70s. It’ll likely be a breezy day as drier air moves into the state. Winds will likely come from the northwest at 10-15 mph with isolated gusts up to 20 mph.\nTropical Update (wbrcnews) Next Big Thing: The big story this week is that temperatures will likely trend well below average. We will likely see morning temperatures cool into the upper 40s Tuesday morning with afternoon highs in the upper 60s and lower 70s. Another round of cooler air will move into Alabama Tuesday afternoon giving us a partly cloudy sky. The coolest temperatures this week will likely occur Wednesday into Thursday morning.\nHigh Temperatures (wbrcnews) We want to give everyone a first alert for the potential to see patchy frost Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Temperatures will likely drop into the upper 30s and lower 40s. Patchy frost will become more likely for areas north of Birmingham. It will not surprise me if some locations drop in the mid 30s along and north of Hwy 278. If you are worried about sensitive plants, I would highly recommend covering them up or bringing them inside Tuesday evening and again Wednesday evening. High temperatures will likely remain in the mid to upper 60s Wednesday and Thursday. By the end of the week, we should see plenty of sunshine with high temperatures warming into the 70s with lows in the mid to upper 40s Friday and Saturday. No sign of rain over the next five to seven days.\nTropical Update: The Atlantic is thankfully very quiet at the moment. Leslie dissipated in the Central Atlantic, and the only system worth watching is a weak tropical wave located in the eastern Atlantic. Odds for development has lowered to 20% for the next seven days. Long-range models hint that this low will remain weak for the first half of the week as it pushes off to the west. There’s a chance that it could try to develop by next weekend as it approaches the Lesser Antilles, Hispaniola, and possibly Cuba. It remains too early to know if it could impact the United States. For now, rest easy knowing that the tropics remain quiet for the United States over the next seven days. The next name up on the 2024 Hurricane list is “Nadine”. Hurricane season officially ends December 1.\nMake sure you download the WBRC First Alert Weather app on Android and Apple devices for the latest weather information.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2024 WBRC.
