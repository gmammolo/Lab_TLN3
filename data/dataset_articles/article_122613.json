  "text": "Sunny and Warm Sunday\nSunny and Warm Sunday\nWE’RE STARTING OFF WITH SOME FOG. WHERE ARE WE SEEING THAT THE FOG IS QUITE DENSE? THIS MORNING IN MARION COUNTY. OUTSIDE OF THAT, WE’RE NOT REALLY DEALING WITH THAT DENSE FOG VISIBILITY DOWN TO JUST A MILE AND A HALF RIGHT NOW IN OCALA, A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES RIGHT NOW, ROMEO AND WE’RE ALSO DEALING WITH VERY DENSE FOG THIS MORNING IN REDDICK CITRA, AS WELL AS LYNN WEIRSDALE. LOOK AT THAT HALF MILE VISIBILITY. SO JUST A HEADS UP, IF YOU’RE HEADING OUT THIS MORNING, PARTICULARLY IN MARION COUNTY, MAY BE DEALING WITH SOME VERY, VERY LOW VISIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF THAT THOUGH COMFORTABLE. START ON YOUR SUNDAY MORNING 67 RIGHT NOW IN DELAND, 68 IN LEESBURG. GOOD MORNING ORLANDO. YOU’RE AT 70 RIGHT NOW. HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON WILL CLIMB INTO THE LOW 80S FOR AREAS ALONG THE COAST. WHILE INLAND SPOTS. EXPECT YOUR HIGHS IN THE MID 80S THIS AFTERNOON WHICH IS QUITE TYPICAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. JUST TRACKING A FEW RAIN SHOWERS THIS MORNING IN COASTAL BREVARD COUNTY. JUST A TINY SHOWER THERE NEAR SATELLITE BEACH IN COCOA BEACH. AND WE ALSO HAVE THIS RAIN SHOWER RIGHT NOW HOVERING OVER FLORIDANA BEACH THIS MORNING. CHANCES OF RAIN TODAY ARE GOING TO BE FAIRLY LOW. I ONLY HAVE A 10% CHANCE IN THE FORECAST. THAT’S MOSTLY GOING TO BE FOR COASTAL BREVARD COUNTY TODAY. SO IF YOU’RE HEADING OUT TO THE THEME PARKS OR MAYBE YOU’RE CLEANING UP AFTER MILTON, STILL, WEATHER WISE, IT SHOULD COOPERATE. IT WILL BE A WARM AFTERNOON, THOUGH, RIGHT AROUND 79 DEGREES BY NOONTIME ALREADY. THEN WE’LL CLIMB INTO THE MID 80S BY ABOUT 3:00 TOMORROW MORNING. STARTING OFF A PRETTY SIMILAR A COMFORTABLE START IN WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 60S, AND THEN TOMORROW AFTERNOON SLIGHTLY WARMER HERE. WE’LL TOP OUT RIGHT AROUND THE MID TO UPPER 80S TOMORROW AFTERNOON IN ORLANDO. HIGHS TOMORROW IN THE MID 80S FOR AREAS ALONG THE COAST. NOW LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE RIVER LEVELS. LET’S DO THE SAINT JOHNS RIVER STARTING OFF AT LAKE HARNEY. RIGHT NOW IT’S AT 9.6. IT’S EXPECTED TO CREST THOUGH JUST A LITTLE BIT OVER TEN FEET ON WEDNESDAY. RIGHT NOW IT’S AT MODERATE STAGE. BUT LOOK IT’S GOING TO CLIMB INTO MAJOR STAGE FLOOD STAGE AS WE GET INTO EARLY WEEK MONDAY AND TUESDAY BEFORE CRESTING ON WEDNESDAY. HERE’S A LOOK AT THE SAINT JOHNS RIVER NEAR SANFORD. WE’RE RIGHT NOW AT MINOR FLOOD STAGE, BUT EXPECTED TO CLIMB TO MODERATE FLOOD STAGE THE NEXT FEW DAYS. IT IS EXPECTED TO CREST ON THURSDAY AT 7.9FT. RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, WE’RE CURRENTLY AT 6.5 AND RISING. THE SAINT JOHNS RIVER AT DELAND. WE ARE EXPECTING IT TO CREST ON THURSDAY AS WELL. RIGHT NOW IT’S AT 5.4, RIGHT? IT’S AT MAJOR FLOOD STAGE AND WILL CONTINUE TO CLIMB AS WE GO INTO LATE WEEK. AND FINALLY, THE SAINT JOHNS RIVER AT ASTOR RIGHT NOW AT 4.7, DEFINITELY A MAJOR FLOOD STAGE. THE GOOD NEWS IS IT IS SLOWLY RECEDING. THERE AT ASTOR, HEADING OUT TO THE TROPICS, TRACKING THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE THAT IS NOW NINE TO INVEST. 94 L WATCHING THAT LOW CHANCE OF DEVELOPMENT. BUT WE’VE GOT TO WATCH AS IT MOVES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. SOME OF THE MODELS ARE HINTING IT MAY STRENGTHEN OR DEVELOP INTO SOMETHING AS IT MOVE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. AGAIN WE HAVE SEVERAL DAYS OUT TO WATCH THAT. HERE’S A LOOK AT YOUR CENTRAL FLORIDA CERTIFIED MOST ACCURATE FORECAST. A COLD FRONT MOVES IN LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY, BRINGING US MUCH COOLER WEATHER, LATE WEEK.\nAdvertisement\nSunny and Warm Sunday\nSunday Forecast\nSunday Forecast\nAdvertisement",
