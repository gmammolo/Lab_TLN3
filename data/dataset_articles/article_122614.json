  "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - This weekend is proving to be picture-perfect. But you don’t have to wait long for cooler temperatures and a nicer fall feel.\nAfternoon highs will return to the 80s today through Tuesday with lows in the 50s and 60s.\nBruce: It's a Saints Sunday and sunny skies and a Saints win will prevail. Highs today warming to the low to mid 80s. Lows in the 60s north and south. A real fall front artrives Wednesday as temps fall a good 10-15° degress. pic.twitter.com/UgUqBro0PY\n— Bruce Katz (@BruceKatzFOX8) October 13, 2024 A cold front arrives late Tuesday, dropping our daytime highs to the 70s Wednesday through Friday.\nThe drier air will also allow for overnight lows to cool significantly. Some of the coolest temperatures we’ve seen this season will arrive on Thursday morning when many on the Northshore will fall to the 40s while the Southshore will see the upper 50s.\nThe dry conditions continue through next week with rain chances returning next weekend.\nTropics: Remnants of Leslie still meander out to sea... while a tropical disturbance just off the coast of Africa has a small chance of developing.\nOther than that, the tropics remain fairly quiet.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
