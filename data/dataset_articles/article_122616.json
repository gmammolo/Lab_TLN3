  "text": "SHREVEPORT, La. (KSLA) - Happy Sunday! Today’s highs will be approaching or breaking daily record highs around the area. Highs will be ranging from the lower 90s to the north to the upper 90s, maybe even the triple digits, near east Texas! This is mainly due to compressional heating from the incoming cold front from the northwest, which is destined to bring us more fall-like weather.\nThe incoming cold front will remain dry and will move southeastward across most of the country, sending our highs into the 80s by Monday and Tuesday and into the 70s by Wednesday! Our lows will also drop into the 40s for a couple of mornings before rising back into the 50s later in the week. Something exciting to look forward to if you are tired of the warm weather!\nToday, though, there is an elevated risk for wildfires around the ArkLaTex. This is caused by breezy conditions, dry vegetation, and relatively low humidity. Some key things to watch out for today, and the next few days, are properly disposing of cigarettes and avoiding activities involving an open flame or spark. Stay safe and enjoy your Sunday!\nCopyright 2024 KSLA.
