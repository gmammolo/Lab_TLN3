  "text": "The good thing about being from New Hampshire and getting caught in Hurricane Milton is many hearty folks from these parts have “transferable skills,” having survived blizzards, microbursts and wild thunderstorms. The bad thing is that Florida’s brand of natural disasters can be a tad more intense when you’re staring down a tropical cyclone raging toward the coast as a Category 5 a day before it makes landfall. Olivia Torres, 21, who grew up in Nashua and is now a senior at the University of Tampa, said she’s definitely getting the hang of it. “Since this is technically my third hurricane, I knew what I was going into, but the fact that it turned into a Category 5 had me a little bit worried,” Torres said. “Especially because where the University of Tampa is situated, it is in Flood Zone A. So out of everybody in Tampa, we were the first to be like, ‘Yeah, we need to go.’” Hurricane Milton weakened as it approached Tampa, making landfall as a Category 3 late Wednesday. Torres and her classmates had already bugged out of their on-campus housing by Tuesday morning. Torres’s 19-year-old brother, Jackson, is also a UT student. Their dad, Walt, came to get them on Monday night and take them to Kissimmee, where he and his wife, Gloria, recently moved. “Thankfully, there hasn’t been too much damage where I am,” Olivia Torres said. “I know some other places can’t say the same.” Although most of their family is still back in New England, Olivia Torres said she now feels like a battle-tested Floridian. “I definitely think after four years of living here, I’m an official Florida resident because when this hurricane came around, I was like, ‘All right, let’s go.’ I already had a plan in place,” she said. “It’s like you’re trading in your snow days for hurricane weeks, or ‘hurrication’ as they call it down here.” ‘Gator Aid’ From Tampa to Kissimmee to Gainesville, several New Hampshire residents were in Florida during the storm, which brought dangerous winds, heavy rain, flooding, storm surge and nearly 40 tornadoes. Five [logistics specialists from New Hampshire’s Army National Guard](https://www.unionleader.com/news/safety/new-hampshire-guard-races-to-florida-ahead-of-hurricane/article_bb9bc98c-84f5-11ef-9bbc-5beb4fedd2f4.html) settled into their weeklong mission Wednesday after arriving at the Robert F. Ensslin Jr. National Guard armory in Gainesville on Tuesday after 19 hours of driving. With an unofficial moniker of “Gator Aid,” the Granite Staters began their mission of managing convoys of supplies and personnel. Lt. Col. Greg Heilshorn, public affairs officer for the New Hampshire National Guard, provided an update on Facebook from the team Thursday after speaking on the phone with Capt. James Kelly, a logistics chief for Joint Force Headquarters. “We are providing breathing room for Florida as all this extra help flows into the state,” said Kelly, a Nashua resident. Kelly’s team is coordinating incoming support from the rest of the country, including 6,000 inbound guardsmen from 15 states, 22 helicopters, more than 500 high-water vehicles, and 13 boats, he said. As of noon Thursday, the team was tracking 35 separate movements and 1,400 guardsmen in transit. New Hampshire also sent Capt. Justin Moran, 1st Lt. Christopher Bruneau, Master Sgt. Bernard Hudgens and Sgt. 1st Class Scott Jones. Hudgens and Jones were among 500 New Hampshire guardsmen who deployed to New Orleans in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. “The group we have down here — everyone gets along,” Kelly said. “We are plugged in. We are working super hard. Morale is great.” New Hampshire [also deployed five members of its Homeland Security and Emergency Management team](https://www.unionleader.com/news/safety/new-hampshire-sends-more-aid-to-florida-for-life-threatening-hurricane-milton/article_626769e8-866c-11ef-bcc9-ef1f6dadc73f.html) to Florida on Wednesday. Lisa Carter, who lives in New Hampshire, has family in Lakeland, Florida. Her mother, stepfather and sister sheltered together. Carter’s mom, Diane Wilkes, moved to an upscale 55-plus mobile home community in Florida in 2016. Her sister, Tresa Carter, moved there from Delaware recently to be closer to their mom. Wilkes and her husband, Peter, stayed with Tresa Carter. “Everybody is doing great. I was just on the phone with them earlier today,” Lisa Carter said Thursday afternoon. Lakeland was spared from Milton’s full wrath, but Lisa Carter’s family lost power and there was some damage to the rental property Tresa Carter owns. The tornadoes did get pretty close to them in Lakeland though. “There were tornadoes along Interstate 4 going into Orlando. Mileage-wise, that was only about 10-15 miles from where my parents and my sister were,” she said. Lisa Carter runs a website called [letsmovetofla.com](https://www.letsmovetofla.com), which helps people from other states learn everything they can about moving to Florida. Through the website and social media, she ended up helping direct first-timers to the resources they needed on the ground during the hurricane. “There’s so much you don’t know before you get down there,” she said.",
