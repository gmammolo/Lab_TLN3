  "text": "Happy Colorado Sunday, friends.\nThis has been a particularly blissful autumn (and I know, I just jinxed us all by saying it), the temperate days a lovely invitation to take a walk around and just observe.\nI’ve been a bit obsessed by the scraggly apple trees along my walking routes, wondering what magic has allowed them to survive and thrive, and this year in particular, put out staggering amounts of fruit. These are old trees, not some twee varieties grafted up to appeal to the eyes of supermarket shoppers or factory orchards that value refrigerator hardiness over flavor. I often wonder where they came from, and I’m excited to occasionally see trees in my neighborhood that have been inventoried and tagged by the Boulder Apple Tree Project , which hopes to better understand the genetics of the most resilient trees in our county.\nIt’s that kind of work that led to the rescue of the Colorado Orange apple. In this week’s cover story Sue McMillin explains how a single tree in Fremont County has led to a kind of orchard renaissance for a variety of fruit that was economically important back in the day.\nDana Coffield\nEditor\nThe Cover Story Secrets of the Colorado Orange apple starting to be revealed Apple trees draped in fruit tree worm netting at Ela Family Farms near Hotchkiss. (William Woody, Special to The Colorado Sun) When I read The Sun’s story five years ago about the Colorado Orange apple, I was intrigued because I live in Fremont County, where that heritage apple originated and where that last tree was discovered. The precise location of the tree was a deeply held secret until the tree died and nobody had to worry about people searching for it. Turns out it was only a few miles from my house.\nBut now there are new Colorado Orange apple trees popping up in Fremont County and around the state, and this year the first known harvest of a few apples is taking place.\nIt was a joy to talk to the people who made that happen because they are passionate about what they do. Jude Schuenemeyer, whose grafts led to the trees being on the market, and Steve Ela, who was beginning to taste test the first couple dozen apples appearing at his Hotchkiss orchard, were more than willing to talk about the Colorado Orange and the revival of heritage apples.\nIt might not turn out to be the tastiest eating apple — or maybe it will, the verdict isn’t in. But it sure was fun to write about its rebirth.\nREAD THIS WEEK’S COLORADO SUNDAY FEATURE\nSue McMillin | Writer\nThe Colorado Lens People make the place and our visual journalists encountered some highly compelling characters in their travels last week.\nA supporter of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, wearing a Trump costume, waits for a rally to begin Friday at Gaylord Rockies hotel in Aurora. (Tri Duong, Special to The Colorado Sun) Democrat Adam Frisch, left, and Republican Jeff Hurd, candidates for U.S. House of Representatives for Colorado District 3, listen to presentations during a candidate forum Wednesday in Montrose. (William Woody, Special to The Colorado Sun) Former Denver City Council President Albus Brooks leads a walk Tuesday through the Golden Doors, which are brought out every time a new block on the 16th Street Mall reopens. The 16th Street Mall Project, under renovation since April 2022, is about half complete. The mall is expected to fully reopen by summer 2025.

(Danika Worthington, The Colorado Sun) Colorado knows The Wolf’s Tailor is good — that’s why you’d be wise to get a reservation in advance. The Michelin Guide knows it’s good — that’s why they awarded it one star and a green star for sustainability. James Beard knows it’s good — that’s why Kelly and Erika Whitaker won the Outstanding Restaurateur Award in 2024 for the eateries under their umbrella.\nSurely it’s time for more everyday foodies to start catching on, right?\nLast weekend was a chance to find out. Chef de cuisine Taylor Stark headed to the desert to join acclaimed chef Angelo Sosa at his J.W. Marriott restaurant Kembara in Scottsdale, Arizona, for an S. Pellegrino-sponsored event, A Taste of Mentorship.\nStark, along with his mentee chef Caleb Rocha, collaborated with Sosa, a “Top Chef” alum, and his mentee, Kembara’s chef de cuisine Penny Tagliarina, to create an eight-course menu featuring their interpretations of Asian classics in an intimate dining experience.\nAnd while the focus of the evening was on how chefs can bring up young talent in the culinary world, I couldn’t help but notice a discrete sous chef in the kitchen: Colorado.\nThanks to Stark’s hardline dedication to sustainability, many of his dishes had a bit of Colorado in them, from bison strip loin sourced from local farms and ranches to spruce tips cultivated at high altitude during the summer.\nStark ended the night by thanking everyone for the rare opportunity to take his food out of Denver. The Arizonans got to see how “transformative” and “powerful,” as Sosa described it, the Wolf’s Tailor is. But as I mentioned, we here in Colorado already knew that.\nThe Wolf’s Tailor is located at 4058 Tejon St., Denver, 80211. It’s open 5-9 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Be smart and make a reservation. thewolfstailor.com\nDanika Worthington | Presentation Editor\nSunLit: Sneak Peek In “Homestead,” a plot of frontier land leads to a quick courtship “He is not wide or tall in strap, but wiry, a spine set straight. She dares not turn her head around and sinks into her seat. Then a tap on her shoulder. On a scrap of paper he has written: 150 ACRES. ”\n— From “Homestead”\nEXCERPT: Author Melinda Moustakis’ debut novel “Homestead,” a finalist for the Colorado Book Awards, calls on her Alaskan roots and family history to create a stunning portrait of the everyday challenges of building a life and a relationship from a tract of government-issued land on the frontier. Her excerpt introduces the main characters, Lawrence and Marie, as well as the wilderness they will call home and the straightforward beginning of their connection.\nREAD THE SUNLIT EXCERPT\nTHE SUNLIT INTERVIEW: Moustakis’ first book, the short story collection “Bear Down, Bear North: Alaska Stories” told tales of three generations of this same homesteading family. For her first novel, she decided to zero in on one of those generations and tell their origin story. Here’s a portion of her Q&A:\nSunLit: Tell us this book’s backstory. What inspired you to write it? Where did the story/theme originate?\nMelinda Moustakis: “Homestead” was inspired by my maternal grandparents, who met in Anchorage and very quickly married and lived on an old school bus on 150 acres of a homestead claim in Point MacKenzie through their first winter waiting to build a cabin. The book takes place between 1956 and 1959. My grandmother was from Texas and met my grandfather on a trip to Anchorage while visiting her sister. They were married for 50 years, which I could wrap my head around, but what I could not imagine was the everydayness of being married to a practical stranger and living on a bus in the first winter of a marriage.\nSo the project came out of the question of how to survive one day at a time.\nREAD THE INTERVIEW WITH MELINDA MOUSTAKIS\nLISTEN TO A PODCAST WITH THE AUTHOR\nKevin Simpson | Writer\nSunday Reading List A curated list of what you may have missed from The Colorado Sun this week.\n💧 WATER MYTHS Cities in the West are booming.
