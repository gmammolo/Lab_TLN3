  "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - This weekend is proving to be picture-perfect. But you don’t have to wait long for cooler temperatures and a nicer fall feel.\nAfternoon highs will return to the 80s Sunday through Tuesday, with lows in the 50s and 60s.\nBruce: It's a Saints Sunday and sunny skies and a Saints win will prevail. Highs today warming to the low to mid 80s. Lows in the 60s north and south. A real fall front artrives Wednesday as temps fall a good 10-15° degress. pic.twitter.com/UgUqBro0PY\n— Bruce Katz (@BruceKatzFOX8) October 13, 2024 A cold front arrives late Tuesday, dropping our daytime highs into the 70s for Wednesday through Friday.\nThe drier air also will allow for overnight lows to cool significantly. Some of the coolest temperatures we’ve seen this season will arrive Thursday morning, when many on the north shore will fall into the 40s while the south shore will see the upper 50s.\nThe dry conditions continue through next week, with rain chances returning next weekend.\nIn the tropics, the remnants of Leslie are meandering out to sea, while a tropical disturbance just off the coast of Africa has a small chance of developing.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
