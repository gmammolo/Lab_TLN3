  "text": "Temperatures in the 90s ahead for Phoenix area PHOENIX (AZFamily) —The heat is not quite done yet. On Sunday, expect a high of 103 degrees in the Valley. That is 2 degrees above the record of 103 degrees and 13 degrees above the normal 90 degrees. The forecast high for Monday is 100, followed by a high of 96 on Tuesday. We have not had high temperatures in the 90s since Sept. 22nd! A disturbance in the jet stream will move in mid to late week and knock temperatures down even further. Highs will likely be in the low 90s on Thursday and maybe the upper 80s by Friday and Saturday. This disturbance will also increase the chance of showers late in the week, although the best chance of showers will be in the higher terrain northeast of Phoenix. In addition to the shower chance for the mountains late in the week, there is a slight possibility that the highest elevations could receive a little snow. Stay tuned!
