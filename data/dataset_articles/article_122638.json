  "text": "It’s hard to believe that it was seven years ago. I’ll never forget Hurricane Harvey. It wasn’t the only hurricane I’ve experienced here in south central Texas, but it was by and far the biggest and most damaging storm I have lived through. My most vivid memories of Hurricane Harvey, however, are not of the storm itself, but of the days and weeks which followed. Thirty volunteers from other parts of Texas descended on our church to spend four days in Edna, helping us and our neighbors clean up. Our national church body sent tools and supplies. Individuals from around the country donated thousands of dollars to disperse to those in need. Together with a crew from our church, the volunteers were able to assist over one hundred households in our community, clearing out trees and branches from yards, mending fallen fences, and temporarily patching roofs. The generosity of other Christians from here in Texas and around the country was truly a blessing to our small church and community. God and our neighbors stepped up in our time of need. I’m sure many living in the southeastern United States won’t soon forget Hurricane Helene. The huge hurricane hit Florida with a bang, but it didn’t stop there. It cut a path of destruction up through Georgia and the Carolinas and into Kentucky. People living hundreds of miles from the coast, who never dreamed they would experience the wrath of a hurricane, now find themselves where we were seven years ago. This last Sunday, we prayed for them at our church. We prayed that God give them hope and help and comfort in their time of need. What we sometimes forget as Christians is that we are often God’s answer to our prayers. What I mean is that God uses us to provide his help and hope and comfort to others. In many ways, we are God’s hands and feet and mouth here on earth. For those of us living on the Gulf Coast of Texas, we now have the opportunity to do just that—to be God’s hands and feet and mouth. We can give. We can go. We can help. We know firsthand how it feels to see our homes and yards and cars devastated by damage. We know how it feels to sit for days without electricity. We know that the cleanup and rebuilding doesn’t end when the camera crews move on and the next disaster dominates the news cycle. So, pray for the people who are still cleaning up and getting back on their feet after Hurricane Helene. But also remember that you may be the answer to that prayer. Give. Help. Volunteer. You know how encouraging it is to receive a helping hand.",
