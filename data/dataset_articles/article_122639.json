  "text": "In the Spell Wallet mini app, users purchase upgrades and solve challenges to earn MANA, which gives holders access to crypto airdrops. The mini app has a magical theme, and also features an NFT marketplace where users can mint their own NFTs or purchase NFTs created by other players.\nSpell Wallet daily puzzle for October 14, 2024\nEvery day, players can solve a puzzle to earn a 1 MANA reward. Here is the Spell Wallet daily puzzle solution for October 14, 2024:\nTo solve the daily puzzle, go to the â€œQuestsâ€� section of the Spell Wallet mini app and scroll down to â€œDaily Puzzleâ€�. Then, select the correct combination to get a reward of 1 MANA.\nIf you enjoy Telegram games, weâ€™re sure you will love CoinGram, the official mini app from CoinCodex! By earning coins in the app, you will become eligible for monthly giveaways with real rewards. The more coins you get, the better chances you will have at winning a prize.\nHow to maximize your Spell Wallet rewards\nUnlike many other Telegram games that are popular at the moment, Spell Wallet is not a â€œclickerâ€� game.\nAlthough you have to tap the screen a few times to start MANA production, the vast majority of the game revolves around purchasing upgrades that increase your passive earning power. After you activate autoclaim, you should try to enable your boost every 6 hours if you want to maximize rewards.\nIn addition to buying upgrades, you can also earn MANA in the Spell Wallet mini app by completing quests, solving the daily puzzle, and inviting friends to the app.\nThereâ€™s a variety of quests in Spell Wallet. Some quests involve basic tasks such as following official Spell Wallet accounts on different social media platforms such as Telegram and X (formerly known as Twitter).\nOccasionally, Spell Wallet also partners with other crypto and blockchain projects to launch quests with special rewards.\nYou can earn substantial amounts of MANA by referring your friends to Spell Wallet. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of the rewards you get when you reach different referral targets:\n- Invite 1 friend: 3 MANA, plus 3% of each friendâ€™s claim\n- Invite 10 friends: 15 MANA, plus 5% of each friendâ€™s claim\n- Invite 20 friends: 30 mana, plus 7% of each friendâ€™s claim\n- Invite 100 friends: 150 MANA, plus 10% of each friendâ€™s claim\nSpell Wallet airdrop\nUnlike most other games on Telegram, where users earn points to be eligible for the gameâ€™s airdrop, the goal of Spell Wallet is to connect users with new cryptocurrency projects and earn their tokens.\nBy participating in the Spell Wallet mini app and earning mana, users can become eligible for airdrops from a variety of projects. So although there is currently no information about a Spell Wallet airdrop, the Spell Wallet mini app allows you to discover and participate in airdrops from exciting new projects.\nHamster Kombat is just one of the many tap-to-earn games that have become extremely popular in recent months.
