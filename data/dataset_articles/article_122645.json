  "text": "Journalist Kevin Myatt has been writing about weather for 20 years. His weekly column, appearing on Wednesdays, is sponsored by Oakey’s, a family-run, locally owned funeral home with locations throughout the Roanoke Valley.\nA once-in-a-generation aurora display lit up Virginia night skies on May 10. Then, exactly five months later, it happened again.\nThursday night’s G4-level geomagnetic storm of ejected solar particles was not quite as strong as the G5 storm that occurred in May, but depending on location and timing of viewing, many Virginians who witnessed it considered the aurora show it produced just as spectacular as, if not even a little better than, the one just five months before.\nPillars of red light move across the northern sky as seen from the author’s location south of Roanoke, which had more visibility for this past Thursday’s aurora than occurred in May. Photo by Kevin Myatt. Photos within and at the bottom of this article, taken by Cardinal News readers and supporters from across our Southwest and Southside Virginia coverage area and slightly beyond, illustrate the vivid nature of Thursday’s aurora display. We documented the same for May’s aurora event, linked here , and also recalled a spectacular aurora show that flashed over the Battle of Fredericksburg during the Civil War.\nThe May 10 and October 10 events mark the first times the aurora borealis has been seen this widespread and as brilliantly at Virginia’s latitude – and even farther south – in at least 21 years, since late October 2003. The aurora has been seen by those at more remote locations in the commonwealth away from city lights perhaps a half-dozen other times in 2024, including as recently as the previous weekend .\nTyler Anderson traveled from the Roanoke Valley to the summit of Spruce Knob in West Virginia to witness the full spectacle of the aurora borealis from the highest point in West Virginia. Courtesy of Tyler Anderson. “I am without speech,” photographer Billy Bowling posted on social media as a radiant show of the Northern Lights unfolded before him at his Belfast viewing location in Russell County. Bowling has spent many prior days documenting the Hurricane Helene disaster in western North Carolina and Southwest Virginia, delivering goods to those in in need. Courtesy of Billy Bowling. There are two independent concepts to understand why there has been a sudden excited buzz about auroras this year in Virginia and over much of the U.S. far away from the northern states that see them more regularly.\nFirst, we are at the peak of an 11-year solar cycle when the sun has been emitting more frequent and more intense sprays of charged particles. So yes, what we’ve been seeing lately with auroras is unusual.\nSecondly, the technology of digital photography and the ubiquitousness of social media have allowed these events to be captured much more easily by exponentially more people and communicated widely very quickly.\nEllis Gross, a Liberty Universty freshman from Roanoke County, traveled to Shenandoah National Park for a look at the aurora borealis display. Courtesy of Ellis Gross. What would have, in the past, been documented well only by a small percentage of professional and advanced amateur photographers with the right equipment on precise settings is now literally at the fingertips of millions of smartphone users, their devices capable of pulling in images far better than the naked eye can detect with little or no technical knowledge or special ability. And those images can be transmitted globally with a few more keystrokes to post on social media.\n“There’s more to it though than just the elevated solar activity — digital camera photography has absolutely exploded in the last 20 years,” said Peter Forister, a Charlottesville- based natural phenomenon photographer . “Now the most basic smartphone has a more advanced and sensitive camera sensor than even the best digital cameras around 2000. Also throw social media in the mix — word gets around to everybody, and it gets around fast. Now, everybody with a smartphone and vague interest in the night sky can capture aurora photos and follow updates to the second of when activity is occurring.”\nThis photo from Peter Forister looks southward at Dolly Sods in West Virginia, capturing what is likely a “stable auroral red” (SAR) arc during Thursday night’s geomagnetic storm that produced a strong display of the aurora borealis. The SAR arc was faintly visible overhead in Southwest Virginia around 10 p.m. Thursday night. The bright light is the first-quarter moon. Courtesy of Peter Forister. Forister, a degreed meteorologist from Virginia Tech who also helps run the Explore Fall website and associated social media that track changing fall foliage nationally, was among those alerting his followers to the potential for Thursday’s major solar storm as early as Wednesday. He traveled to the open high country of the Dolly Sods Wilderness in West Virginia for expansive views of Thursday night’s aurora uninhibited by terrain, vegetation, or light pollution.\n“We’re at the peak of the solar cycle right now in late 2024 and will continue to see elevated activity for the next couple of years at least,” said Forister, who said he fell in love auroras having seen them Iceland while photographing volcanic activity and in the Northern Plains during storm chasing trips. “Additionally, this solar cycle is quite a bit stronger than the last one in the early 2010s, so it’s really the first period in over two decades that we’ve had this kind of elevated geomagnetic activity. The last time would have been 2001-2003, when there are plenty of aurora reports and pics from equally far south.”\nOrran Oakey said he and his wife saw the aurora borealis for the first time in their over 70 years, driving a short distance from northern Franklin County to near the Blue Ridge Parkway in Floyd County.

So it is very likely aurora displays at least visible in more remote areas away from city lights will continue to recur in the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, with at least some chance of something similar to the more widely visible May and October aurora displays occurring yet again.\nThe Hanging Rock Raptor Observatory, just over the state line from Craig County near Union, W.Va., provided both a spectacular viewpoint for Luke Barrette, a Virginia Tech meteorology student from Roanoke, and scenic foreground for the aurora borealis on Thursday night,.Oct. 10.

Did a derecho make the difference at the Battle of Yorktown? James S. Baillie depicts British Gen. Cornwallis handing his sword to American Gen. George Washington, with the French fleet lined up in the Chesapeake Bay beyond, after the Battle of Yorktown in October 1781. This scene apparently never occurred, as Cornwallis is reported to have cited illness and left the sword surrender to another general. Courtesy of The Smithsonian. The year 2026 marks the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Cardinal News has embarked on a three-year project to tell the little-known stories of Virginia’s role in the march to independence. The next installment publishes Tuesday. In it, Cardinal weather journalist Kevin Myatt writes about how the weather may have made a difference at the Battle of Yorktown.
