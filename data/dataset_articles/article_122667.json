  "text": "Considering the wintry weather that has prevailed since about mid-November, it’s almost startling to remind oneself that, on the calendar, it’s still fall.\nThat’s right, the season of winter technically doesn’t arrive in our Northern Hemisphere until 10:03 a.m. (EST) on Sunday.\nThat marks the arrival of the winter solstice, the day with the fewest hours of sunlight throughout the year, making it the shortest day of the year.\nThankfully, after we reach the winter solstice, the days begin to grow longer again until we reach the summer solstice — the first day of summer and the longest day of the year.\nBut in the meantime, it’s winter. Decidedly winter.\nOur Twin Tiers region has had more snow in latter November and up to this point in December than is usual for the last several years and, for many area residents, it’s a time to either hate it — or embrace it.\nFor those who embrace winter and the potential fun that it can bring, today’s printed Olean Times Herald includes the annual winter special section, Venture into the Alleghenies, produced by staff who write for the OTH as well as The Salamanca Press and The Bradford Era. The insert includes several articles about winter activities, from skiing in Ellicottville, to cross-country skiing, fat-tire biking and snowshoeing in Allegany State Park and snowmobiling throughout the region.\nThere’s even some information about possible indoor activities for folks who are getting a little stir-crazy in the grip of the cold and snow.\nWe hope you check it out.\nTHEATER PRODUCTION BENEFITS OPERATION WARM HEARTS\nSometimes live theater is about performance, sometimes it’s about storytelling and sometimes it’s about bringing a community together in the spirit of the season.\nThis holiday season, it proved to be all of that and more.\nFrom left are Alan Bernstein, Ann Marie Sitter-Tompkins, Paula Bernstein, Darrell Klute, Fred Tompkins, Jake Riggs and Angela Martin Emley. The OTW production of “Every Christmas Story Ever Told (And Then Some!)” helped benefit Operation Warm Hearts Inc.\nOver the course of four Olean Theatre Workshop performances, local audiences gathered to enjoy “Every Christmas Story Ever Told (And Then Some!),” a fast-paced holiday comedy that filled the theater with laughter and cheer. Friends, families and neighbors came together in fellowship, celebrating the joy of live performance during one of the busiest and most meaningful times of the year.\nBut the impact of the show extended well beyond the stage.\nAs part of the production’s community outreach efforts, audience members were encouraged to give back by donating items to Operation Warm Hearts Inc., a local organization that provides essential support to families in need. By the final curtain call, the generosity of the community was unmistakable.\nIn total, donations included 837 diapers, 31 pairs of pajamas, 21 hats, and many other much-needed items, all delivered to Operation Warm Hearts to help support local families during the winter months.\nPaula Bernstein, one of the “Cindys” in the production and producer of the show, expressed gratitude to everyone who attended the performances, shared in the holiday spirit, and contributed to the donation drive.\n“Through laughter, generosity, and community connection,” she says, “the production transformed live theater into something even more meaningful this holiday season, proof that the arts can make a real difference both on and off the stage.”",
