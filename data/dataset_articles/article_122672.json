  "text": "The holidays are here, and in Minnesota, that comes with chilly temperatures and unpredictable winter weather. As the temps drop and the snow piles up, our thoughts often turn to holiday shopping and cozy nights in. But December is more than just a time to celebrate with loved ones at home; it’s a time to protect your home too.\nOur state’s weather is becoming more extreme. From brutal winter ice and wind to summer hail and torrential downpours, a resilient home is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity. Minnesota is not far behind states like California and Florida when it comes to extreme weather events and its impact on rising insurance rates. By taking proactive steps now, you can protect your most valuable asset and potentially find ways to save on your homeowners’ insurance too.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhile we can’t control the elements, we can control how prepared our homes are to face them. As independent insurance agents who work with Minnesotans every day in every corner of our state, we often talk to customers about what different insurers and packages offer for coverage, as well as smart ways to prevent a loss before it happens. Some of these preventative measures can also lead to real cost savings.\nHere are a few tips Minnesotans can do to weatherize their homes and make them more resilient to the elements:\n- Hail-resistant roofing. Our summers bring destructive hailstorms that lead to massive insurance claims. Upgrading your roof with impact-resistant shingles provides superior protection and can also qualify you for a notable discount from many insurance providers. The investment now can mean avoiding a costly deductible and rate hike later. Independent insurance agents can help you navigate what options are out there that align with your coverage needs.\n- Tree trimming and pruning. Heavy snow and high winds make dead or overgrown branches a serious threat. A fallen limb can cause catastrophic roof damage. Use the early winter to clear away vulnerable branches that overhang your house, mitigating a major source of claim risk.\n- Sump pump reliability. While your basement might be dry now, spring melt and deep winter freezes can lead to water intrusion. Ensure your sump pump is fully operational and consider installing a battery backup. Water damage is one of the most common and costly homeowner claims, and this simple check is a powerful defense.\n- Ice dam prevention. Clean gutters and downspouts to prevent blockages, and be sure to remove snow buildup after heavy snowfall. Inspecting and upgrading your attic insulation and ventilation can also help prevent water from backing up under your shingles and flooding your walls, and could also help secure a premium discount.\n- Protecting pipes. Water damage is a common reason people file claims on their homeowners insurance, and pipes freezing are a major contributor to that. When traveling, make sure your house maintains heat while you’re away. Insulating pipes and sealing air leaks also prevent the cold air from impacting your home’s pipes.\nIn addition to the above tips that Minnesota homeowners can do individually, recognizing that extreme weather events are impacting the cost of insurance in our state, the legislature should also act. In 2023, lawmakers created the “Strengthen Minnesota Homes Grant Program” with the aim of creating a pre-disaster mitigation funding that helps homeowners fund resilient roof upgrades. That program has yet to be funded and fully established, but could go a long way to helping Minnesotans make their homes more resilient to hail and storm damage. It will also help secure premium discounts for homeowners who take advantage of the grant program. As the legislature comes back in 2026, they should make this program a priority to support homeowners.\nSo, as we enter into the heart of the winter season, remember that a well-maintained, weatherized home is a lower risk to insure. The end of the year is a great time to take another look at your homeowners’ insurance, explore if there are any critical gaps in your coverage, and see what potential resiliency and weatherization discounts may be available. Independent agents can help walk through your insurance plan to ensure you have the right coverage and can benefit from available opportunities and discounts.\nApril Goodin is executive vice president and CEO of Big I Minnesota, which represents more than 700 agencies and their 3,500 employees and independent agents across Minnesota.",
