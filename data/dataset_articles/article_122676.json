  "text": "December 18, Colombo (LNW): United States Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has drawn attention to the role being played by American companies and institutions in supporting the country’s recovery following the devastation caused by Cyclone Ditwah.\nIn a message shared on social media, the Ambassador said a number of US-based organisations have mobilised resources to assist relief and rebuilding efforts. She noted that technology providers such as Starlink and Microsoft, together with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are contributing practical support on the ground.\nStarlink has extended complimentary connectivity to both new and existing users until the end of December 2025 and has also supplied 145 satellite units to help strengthen communications during emergency operations.\nAt the same time, Microsoft is working in partnership with MIT on a new initiative designed to gather reliable information on businesses and properties damaged by the cyclone, a move intended to improve planning and aid distribution.\nAmbassador Chung said these actions demonstrate the spirit of innovation, partnership and generosity that characterises American engagement, adding that US organisations remain committed to standing with Sri Lanka as it works towards recovery and resilience.",
