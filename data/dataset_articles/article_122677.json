  "text": "Above-average rainfall helps West Country recover from prolonged dry weather\nHeavy rain has pushed the majority West Country’s water situation into recovery\nRecent heavy rain has helped much of the West Country move out of prolonged dry weather conditions, though groundwater levels in parts of Wiltshire remain critically low.\nThe Environment Agency announced today (18th December) that the majority of its Wessex area, which covers Bristol, Somerset, Dorset, south Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire, is now in “recovery.”\nThis follows months of above-average rainfall.\nSeptember saw 142% of average rainfall across the region, followed by 128% in November and a wet start to December.\nThe Environment Agency say high river flows and water company reservoirs partially refilling, are signs the water situation is improving.\nHowever, an area of Wiltshire including Devizes and Salisbury remains classified as experiencing prolonged dry weather due to exceptionally low groundwater levels.\nThey added that sustained rainfall over the winter months is needed to ensure water is available for abstractions and river flows next year.\nIan Withers of the Environment Agency said:\n“The return of heavy rain has benefited the environment after a very dry period. But there is no guarantee that sustained rainfall will continue. We still need a wet winter to prevent the water situation from deteriorating again.\n“Best practices for water sustainability can’t be discarded. Rain or shine, we all have a responsibility for sensible water use.\n“The risk of flooding remains even during a drought. Stay alert, follow flood warning guidance and be ready to deploy any personal property protection.”\nThe Environment Agency say they are continuing to monitor the risk of both flooding and drought.\nThe Met Office’s long-term forecast predicts unsettled weather patterns, but the Agency warns that above-average rain is essential over the winter months to maintain improvements and prevent water supply concerns next year.",
