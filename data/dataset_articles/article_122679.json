  "text": "White Pass Ski Area could open as soon as this weekend if a promising forecast delivers more snow following an unusually warm and rainy start to December.\nThe base and most of the slopes visible from U.S. Highway 12 looked virtually bare earlier this week thanks to significant precipitation from an atmospheric river that caused flooding throughout Washington. Director of skier services Kathleen Goyette said Tuesday afternoon White Pass will be ready to go Saturday if Mother Nature can deliver before five inches of snow fell overnight with another two to three feet expected by Friday night, according to the National Weather Service.\n“It’s always a big reunion when we get open,” Goyette said. “We’re certainly disappointed that we’re not open, but it’s something that’s beyond our control.”\nShe said they’re most concerned about part-time employees, especially those who moved to the area or otherwise upended their lives and have not yet received a paycheck. Fortunately, no staff members have been displaced by flooding, and the White Pass Foundation wants to help students at White Pass School through an Amazon link created to gather any supplies they might need.\nLate openings seem to happen about once every decade and Goyette said this one was overdue, since the last time it happened was the 2014-15 season. White Pass opened on Dec. 12 that season and closed again multiple times due to limited snow, and a similar situation occurred during the 2004-05 season.\nOther Pacific Northwest ski area are going through similar struggles, with only Mission Ridge able to open limited terrain Dec. 4-7 thanks to its superior snowmaking ability and a sizeable storm near Wenatchee. But even the best snowmaking equipment can’t overcome recent conditions, since the machines only work when the weather’s cold and dry.\nThe situation’s even worse at places like Stevens Pass and Crystal Mountain, where road closures caused by flooding have made it impossible to reach the slopes with no estimated date for re-opening. A significant washout on Highway 12 in Naches will keep it closed for several weeks, but a detour offers a relatively easy way for skiers and snowboarders to travel to White Pass from the eastside.\nClosures to Highway 2 and State Route 410 could bring more skiers and snowboarders to White Pass, where Goyette said staff will be ready to handle as many people as possible. Once enough snow falls to give the mountain full coverage, it could be a little more open thanks to the addition of a new fixed grip Dopplemayr Quad to replace Chair 4, an older and slower riblet double.\nGoyette praised workers from Dopplemayr and White Pass for their efforts to complete construction on schedule, allowing it to be certified earlier than anticipated. The new chair will run daily through Christmas break, then Friday through Monday after that, and includes a loading carpet and comfort bar.\n“It’s going to change how people utilize that terrain,” Goyette said. “We’re definitely looking forward to seeing what we think will be a very positive impact from adding that chairlift.”\nWhite Pass held off on selling individual lift tickets for any days before this weekend, and Goyette said customers can change their reservation or simply transition those passes to a “resort credit” online at skiwhitepass.com. Season passes sold well once again, which Goyette said provides even more motivation for staff to work hard and ensure a quality experience for skiers and snowboarders.\nA new variable pricing system already adapted at many other Washington ski areas means daily rates will range from $69-$99 on off-peak days and $89-119 on peak days, depending on a variety of factors. The most affordable skiing will be $59 for adults and $39 for kids during an extended night schedule featuring nine days if White Pass is open — Dec. 26, 27 and 31, Jan. 2,3 and 24, and Feb. 7, 18, 28.\nThe 2024-25 ski season lasted well into April, so the potential exists for plenty of good opportunities so long as the snow and temperatures provide adequate conditions. That will determine how much of the mountain can open and Goyette remains hopeful despite the disappointing start to December.\n“It’ll have an impact but not a giant one,” Goyette said. “We’re kind of focused on looking at the encouraging forecast.”",
