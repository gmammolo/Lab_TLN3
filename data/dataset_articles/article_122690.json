  "text": "Will it be cold in Florida on Christmas? Christmas Eve and Day prediction\nLianna Norman\n- Florida is expected to have a warm Christmas in 2025, with most of the state seeing highs in the 70s.\n- The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts a cooler-than-usual winter for 2025-2026, while the National Weather Service forecasts warmer temperatures.\n- The last time it snowed in Florida was January 2025, when a winter storm brought significant snowfall to the Panhandle.\nFlorida winter is pretty unpredictable. Although much of North Florida has seen freezing temperatures and cold weather for a significant portion of the first two weeks of December, it’s expected to warm up for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\nHere’s what we know about the predicted weather for Christmas 2025 in Florida as of Dec. 18, the Old Farmer’s Almanac prediction for December and January temperatures and the last time it snowed in Florida.\nWill it be cold in Florida for Christmas?\nThe weather in Florida changes significantly depending on where you are in the state. It typically gets much colder in North Florida than it does in South Florida.\nAlthough North Florida has seen a stretch of cold weather in the first two weeks of December, it’s expected to warm up on Christmas Day, Thursday, Dec. 25. This year, nearly all of Florida will see highs in the 70s.\nHere areThe Weather Channel’s predictions for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Orlando and Miami, as of Dec. 18:\n- Jacksonville\n- Christmas Eve: Sunny, high of 70F, low of 54F, 9% chance of rain\n- Christmas Day: Partly cloudy, high of 71F, low of 54F, 8% chance of rain\n- Tallahassee\n- Christmas Eve: Mostly sunny, high of 75F, low of 48F, 9% chance of rain\n- Christmas Day: Mostly sunny, high of 74F, low of 49F, 9% chance of rain\n- Orlando\n- Christmas Eve: Partly cloudy, high of 79F, low of 56F, 8% chance of rain\n- Christmas Day: Partly cloudy, high of 79F, low of 54F, 8% chance of rain\n- Miami\n- Christmas Eve: Partly cloudy, high of 78F, low of 69F, 11% chance of rain\n- Christmas Day: Partly cloudy, high of 79F, low of 67F, 3% chance of rain\nWill winter 2025-2026 be cold in Florida?\nAccording to the Old Farmer’s Almanac 60-day extended weather forecast for Florida, overall, winter is expected to be cooler than usual, with the coldest temperatures in mid-to late December and much of January. Rainfall is forecast to be above normal as well.\nAccording to the same forecast, the average temperature throughout the state for all of December is expected to be two degrees colder than is typical, at 63F, and the average temperature for January is expected to be three degrees colder than is typical, at 58F.\nBy contrast, the National Weather Service’s winter 2025-2026 prediction says that “warmer than normal temperatures and near to below normal rainfall is forecast across much of the southern and eastern continental U.S.”\nWhen was the last time it snowed in Florida? Did it snow in Florida in 2025?\nThe last time it snowed in Florida was in January 2025.\nA freak winter storm that swept the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, brought more than seven inches of snow to Pensacola, doubling the previous record of three inches in 1895.\nCities in Florida’s western panhandle saw between five and 10 inches of snow, while the northeastern portion of the state saw freezing rain and ice that melted once it hit the ground (Jacksonville, for example).\nThe official total from the National Weather Service was 7.6 inches of snow in Pensacola, Jessica Chace, warning coordination meteorologist, told the USA TODAY Network-Florida in January. Santa Rosa County saw even more snow than Pensacola and Tallahassee saw some sludgy snow that collected on the ground, but mostly sleet.\nPensacola saw 7.6 inches of snow between midnight Jan. 21 to midnight Jan. 22, Chace said. Snow started falling at 12:30 p.m. Jan. 21 and ended about 9 p.m. The Milton and Jay areas got nine to 10 inches of snow and some locations near the state line may have received closer to 11.",
