It’s looking like clear skies and warm weather for Christmas in Perth this year, with the early forecast predicting a mostly sunny day and a maximum temperature of 39C. Cottesloe Beach could be the perfect location for CHristmas Day, with a maximum temperature of 39C expected. Credit: Getty Images The Bureau of Meteorology has released its predictions for the weather conditions for Christmas Day in the metropolitan area, with a minimum of 25C expected for next Thursday. BOM is expecting sunny weather with a low possibility of rain - a 95 per cent chance of no rain - an improvement on the cooler conditions of 2024. Last year, the thermometer only reached around 25C and is considered one of the coolest Christmas Days in recent memory. This is compared to the record peak of 42.8C that was recorded back in 2021, which followed a heatwave in 2020 when three days of 40C were recorded over the Christmas period. Christmas Eve this year is also expected to be warm and sunny, with a minimum of 20C and a maximum temperature of 37C predicted. In the week leading up to Christmas it is expected to get progressively warmer, from a low of 29C on Saturday and Sunday, followed by 32C on Monday and up to 35C on Tuesday. Rottnest Island is expected to be a popular destination with warm weather expected on Christmas Day.

As per usual, Hobart appears likely to be the coolest of the state capitals, with a peak of around 19C expected. Prior to the record peak in 2021, Perth’s hottest Christmas temperature of 42C was recorded in 1968 while the lowest Christmas temperature of 19.7 was recorded in 1945, which is also considered the wettest with 17.8mm of rain falling. The hottest Christmas period – Christmas eve, Christmas day and Boxing Day – was registered in 2007 when Perth sweltered through a three-day average temperature of 40.3 degrees.
