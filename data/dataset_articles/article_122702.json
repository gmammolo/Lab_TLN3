  "text": "News\nIllinois farmer credits conservation practices for field’s resiliency to weather extremes\nA north central Illinois farmer says that long-term use of conservation practices is helping his fields cope with weather extremes.\nBrian Corkill, who farms in Henry County, says cover crops and minimal tillage have increased his soil’s water-holding capacity.\n“I don’t even think we had half an inch of rain in August, and it was dry in September, and it was dry in October.” He says, “We had almost 9 inches in July, so with some of the farming practices I do on my farm, we can help retain that water in the field. And so, then there’s more available when we do hit those dry spells.”\nHe tells Brownfield this year that led to above-average results.\n“We had a much better year this year than we did last year.” He says, “Last year, we had a windstorm that did a significant amount of damage. We had one farm that had a significant amount of hail damage, so yields this year were a lot better.”\nCorkill says this year’s cover crops went on smoothly following harvest, and despite the drought, he’s pleased with stand establishment heading into winter.\nAUDIO: Brian Corkill – Illinois farmer",
