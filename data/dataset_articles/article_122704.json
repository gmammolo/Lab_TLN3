  "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – ‘Tis the season for a warm Florida Christmas! Hey Weather Insiders, it’s Chief Meteorologist Candace Campos .\nIf you’re hoping for a chilly holiday week, you might need to travel much farther north as a warming trend looks to hold over the area as Santa comes into town!\nRecommended Videos\n(Submitted) Click here to read more on your weekend and holiday forecast ahead! Merry Christmas to all!\n❄️☃️ Hunting for that cinematic White Christmas? I’ve got you covered 🎄 Snow-covered trees (PIxabay) A WARM welcome back to your newsletter folks, meteorologist David Nazario returning to you to completely avoid talking tropics this go around! Although... note I had to work it in somehow. It’s instinct at this point, to be expected right?\nNo, today for your newsletter I want to touch on that symbolic and cinematic White Christmas a lot of us are (I’d believe) fond of! Maybe not so much if you’re a native Floridian, but I know a lot of you might want to at least experience it once in a lifetime to check it off the old bucket list.\nFlorida looks to bob and weave like a true boxer avoiding all wintry-style weather down here in the southeast. Overall, it might be a little tricky to get yourselves in the path of a White Christmas and fresh snowfall.\nI have a full early breakdown available to you HERE if you have some spare time and want to plan some last minute traveling before the Christmas holiday is in full swing. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions at all!\n🎄 Holiday fun in the Florida sun ☀️ How did the end of the year sneak up on us so fast? Christmas is next week, and we’ll be ringing in the New Year before we know it. Hi there! Meteorologist Michelle Morgan here, with a weekend packed with fun and FESTIVE events across Central Florida.\nIf you’re looking for some last-minute festive fun to enjoy with family or friends — or if you have visitors in town — this weekend is packed with great things to do, and the weather will be fantastic.\nDezerland Park is hosting a Christmas Wonderland this weekend, and it’s definitely a must-see. You can meet the big guy himself, go ice skating on synthetic ice, check out the go-karts, and explore some really cool antique cars.\nLooking for a little staycation? The 12 Days of Holiday Fun at the Orlando World Center Marriott kicks off this weekend and runs through New Year’s Eve, with tons of activities for hotel guests to enjoy.\nOrlando World Center Marriott For all the details — and to check out the rest of my 6 Things to Do — here’s the link.\nCopyright 2025 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",
