  "text": "Wind Warnings Faded, but the Warm Temperatures Have Not\nThe warming ridge may only continue to intensify in the coming days.\nGRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KKCO) -\nHigh winds and snowfall impacted the Northern Mountains overnight. The Front Range also endured powerful wind gusts yesterday. Wind is still impacting the Eastern Plains and Central Mountains this morning, but most precipitation has dissipated.\nWestern Colorado and the Southwestern United States did not experience heavy winds or turbulent weather to the same extent because a high-pressure ridge continues to control the weather, keeping things mild and clear. The temperatures have fallen slightly in response to the surrounding turbulence, but remain unseasonably warm.\nThere is no cooling on the horizon for Western Colorado. Temperatures will rise over the next five days. The high-pressure ridge will move closer to Colorado day by day, eventually centering over the state. Once the epicenter of the warming ridge is over the state, temperatures will hit nearly 60°.\nLong Term:\nLong-range forecast models have begun to show very minor signs of a potential cool-down and shower system late next week. Favoritism for this change may not hold up over the coming days, but the First Alert Weather Team will continue to monitor it.\nCopyright 2025 KKCO. All rights reserved.",
