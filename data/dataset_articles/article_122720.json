With an air temperature of 23 degrees and a steady wind cutting across the course, conditions felt even colder for skiers and spectators alike. A series of last-minute changes sent the meet from its original site to Mahtomedi, and with no lights on the course, teams started early to beat the darkness.\nDespite the unsettled lead up and the biting wind, the Raiders delivered a strong overall performance, highlighted by a first-place finish from the boys varsity team in the Metro East Conference skate race.\nThe Hastings boys totaled 466 points to edge out Two Rivers at 450 and Mahtomedi at 449, a tight race that stayed close throughout the afternoon. Hastings depth proved to be the difference, with multiple skiers finishing near the front of the pack.\nParker Stoltz led the way for the Raiders, skiing to a third-place finish with a time of 18:22.1. Close behind was Micah Trost, who placed fourth in 18:49.0. Aiden Reuter added a seventh-place result in 19:46.9, giving Hastings three skiers in the top ten. Gabe Peterson crossed the line in 11th place at 20:45.4, while David Tireman and Will Carry finished 14th and 15th, continuing the steady scoring for the Raiders. Ben Schwanke and Finn Cullen also contributed varsity finishes, rounding out a balanced team effort in difficult conditions.\nOn the girls side, Hastings earned a third-place team finish with 363 points, behind Two Rivers and Mahtomedi. The Raiders were led by Linnea Ronning, who placed fifth overall with a time of 23:25.9. Denae Trost followed closely in sixth at 25:14.2, giving Hastings a solid one two presence near the front. Annika Hauk finished 13th in 26:59.8, and Mirriam Garofolo added a 19th place result, helping the Raiders hold their position in the team standings.\nWith weather, venue changes, and early start times all part of the day, the meet tested focus as much as fitness. The Hastings skiers responded with resilience and teamwork, opening the season with a conference win for the boys and a steady showing from the girls, a promising start as the winter schedule continues.\nThe Raiders will finish the 2025 calendar year with a meet at Battle Creek Regional Park on Dec. 17 at 3:45 p.m. and kick the new year off on Jan.8 at Hyland Park Reserve, also at 3:45 p.m.",
