  "text": "Perfect Week 16 TNF FanDuel DFS Lineup: Consider Blake Corum in Very Windy Weather\nIn this story:\nWe have an amazing game heading to Seattle for Week 16 Thursday Night Football. The (11-3) Los Angeles Rams will be taking on the (11-3) Seattle Seahawks and this game may very well decide the NFC West title. We are looking to attack this game from the DFS angle, set on providing you with the best lineup advice that is out there. Both teams have great depth to play to a win, and this is how it will break down.\nBest MVP/Captain Picks\nIt is important of us to note that we have very bad weather in store for tonight's game. Especially in the first half, we may see winds well over 20 MPH. Combined with rain, we may see more run-heavy and conservative football.\nOwnership will be split quite evenly across the top names of Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Kyren Williams, among others.\nWe want to chase touchdowns and volume. Williams has the best of them all on the ground. He has an over/under of just (55.5) Yards, and I would love to bet this over, although this is not a betting preview. I would happily put my money on Williams with well-over a 50% chance to score.\nCorum is going to be more cheaply owned. He is working in a near 50-50% split with Williams, so you can save salary and maintain similar upside to Williams. Corum has (280) Yards on (30) Attempts over his last three games, adding (4) Total Touchdowns.\nCharbonnet is the touchdown play in this Seahawks backfield. He has (8) Touchdowns to Walker's (4). He also has (37) Red Zone Rushes to Walker's (32).\nBest MVP/Captain Picks\n- Kyren Williams $15,600\n- Zach Charbonnet $12,300\n- Blake Corum $10,800\nQuarterback: Matthew Stafford vs Sam Darnold\nStafford is on his MVP chase and he does not look to slow down. He is playing without Davante Adams tonight, which surely hurts his upside. Nonetheless, they will push the ball to Jordan Whittington, Konata Mumpfield, Colby Parksinson, and Davis Allen. They should cumulatively replace Adams not to 100%, but to a good percentage.\nThe Seahawks are 7th best versus Quarterbacks. When these two teams met in November, Stafford was held to (13.2) FanDuel Points on 18-28, 243 Yards, 2 Touchdowns, and 2 Interceptions. Stafford is more boom-or-bust than usual.\nDarnold is working to great volume, averaging (240) Yards over his last seven games. When Darnold last played the Rams, he threw (0) Touchdowns and (4) Interceptions. The Rams are 15th versus Quarterbacks, but Darnold has proven to struggle mentally at times, so I would not want to play him tonight.\nIf you play a Quarterback, use Matthew Stafford with high upside, but high-than-usual risk added.\nBest Running Back Picks\nKyren Williams is working to a 50-50% split with Blake Corum. However, this has been a calculated effort by the Rams to conserve Williams. This game matters as much as a playoff game, so they will not hold him back.\nHowever, Corum is averaging over (9) Yards per Attempt over his last three games. The effort is as good as anyone in the NFL. This counteracts any case of Williams gaining a 60-70% workload. I expect a 50-50% split to remain as it has proven very beneficial.\nThe Seahawks are 4th versus Running Backs. This duo went 20-for-101 and 1 Touchdown in their first meeting. It is a moderately difficult matchup.\nKenneth Walker works in a up-and-down split with Zach Charbonnet. For the most part, Walker wins about 55-45%. He does lose in the Red Zone where Charbonnet has a 2-to-1 Touchdown advantage.\nThe Rams are 1st versus Running Backs. This duo combined to go 27-for-104 and 1 Touchdown in their last meeting. You are better off chasing a Touchdown, which favors Charbonnet.\nBest Running Back Picks\n- Kyren Williams $10,400\n- Zach Charbonnet $8,200\n- Blake Corum $7,200\nBest Wide Receiver Picks\nNacua is operating without Adams tonight. When we adjust projected target shares, it brings Nacua to well-over 40%. He should exceed (100) Yards in this game and his usually sub-20% Red Zone Target Share now surges upwards of 30%.\nThe only Rams Wide Receiver to play will be Nacua. In of himself, he may be the WR1 overall this week. The Seahawks are 2nd versus Wide Receivers, but it may not matter against a dynamic Nacua. He went 7-for-75 on 8 Targets in their last meeting.\nThe only Wide Receiver with more volume than Nacua is Jaxon Smith-Njigba. He has a 47% Target Share, which is astonishing. To have over 30% is dominant, to have over 35% is elite, to have... 47% ... that is record-setting.\nThe Rams are just 25th versus Wide Receivers. They will rely on pressuring Darnold to stop the offense. When Darnold gets it out, he should connect well with Smith-Njigba, projecting well-over (100) Yards. Smith-Njigba went 9-for-105 on 12 Targets in their first meeting.\nKupp recorded his fourth game of 7+ Targets in his last game versus the Colts. He maintains the WR2 role, snapping over 75% of snaps in most games. Kupp does only have a 14% Red Zone Target Share, so his upside remains very limited on volume.\nBest Wide Receiver Picks\n- Puka Nacua $12,600\n- Jaxon Smith-Njigba $13,000\nBest Tight End Picks\nColby Parkinson has earned himself a big role in this Rams offense. Can he keep it up?\nParkinson has (17) Targets over his last three games. This has brought him to (12) Receptions, (134) Yards, and (3) Touchdowns on (7) Red Zone Targets. His the trusted replacement to Adams, despite being a Tight End. Success is success, so there is no reason to stop working to Parkinson. The Seahawks are 26th versus the Tight End.\nDavis Allen works to a small, but effective workload. Allen averages 1.9 Targets and 1.3 Receptions per Game, with 3 Total Touchdowns. For $1,600, he might be worth a shot. He very well could score without Adams threatening targets.\nTerrence Ferguson is working to less volume than Allen. He is mispriced, in my opinion. Ferguson has (6) Targets over his last four games. He is snapping on-par with Allen over his last two games.\nAJ Barner is working to a 13% Target Share. He has a 15% Red Zone Target Share, on top of (3) tush-push attempts. Barner is touchdown reliant. The Rams are 13th versus Tight Ends, but Barner did rip off 10-for-70 yards on 11 Targets in their first meeting. He is a risk/reward option, but likely worth it for $5,000.\nBest Tight End Picks\n- Colby Parkinson $7,600\n- AJ Barner $5,000\n- Davis Allen $1,600\nBest Sleeper Picks\nTutu Atwell $4,600\nIf we are playing a sleeper, we are shooting for big plays above all. Atwell averages (34.6) Yards per Reception on his limited sample size of (5) Receptions this season. Atwell averages (14.8) Yards per Reception over his career.\nAtwell returned last week for his first game since Week 7. Xavier Smith offers explosive ability, but he dropped down from 20-30% of snaps to 4% in Week 15. Atwell only played 6%, but he should trend higher as Adams is out and Atwell is a veteran in this offense.\nThe Seahawks work heavily to their common items. They have no sleepers worth playing, in our estimation.\nDefense/Special Teams\nHere is how each teams ranks in key metrics:\nLA Rams | Seattle Seahawks | |\n|---|---|---|\nTotal Offense | 4th | 9th |\nTotal Defense | 14th | 4th |\nSacks per Game (D) | 9th | 4th |\nSacks Allowed per Game (O) | 3rd | 2nd |\nTakeaways per Game (D) | 6th | 5th |\nGiveaways per Game (O) | 6th | 31st |\nBoth teams are elite across the board. The only weakness is Seattle high turnover-rate. Darnold threw (4) Interceptions against the Rams last time out, so any upside to chase might lie with the Rams defense. The Rams are high-upside, but only to be played if you want to save salary and use them at ($6,400)\nKicker: Harrison Mevis vs Jason Myers\nMevis is 5/5 in his short stint with the Rams. This stint does go over four games, averaging (1.25) Attempts Game â€” a low rate. The Rams only average (1.6) Attempts per Game.\nMyers is the K1 in Fantasy Football. He is 37-for-42, but with (9) makes from 50+ and (11) makes from 40-49 yards.\nSeattle will have 20-40 MPH winds tonight, so any kicker is unplayable. Weather should calm down a bit for the 2nd half, but still not great with rain.\nMore Fantasy Sports On SI News:\nTHOMAS CARELLI\nThomas Carelli is a sportswriter based on Northern New Jersey.
