  "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — With the arrival of winter and colder temperatures across Ohio, Columbia Gas is encouraging customers to take steps now to stay safe, warm, and prepared during the winter months.\nSunday, Dec. 21, marks the first official day of winter, and the utility is reminding residents that proper preparation and safe heating practices can help prevent emergencies and keep homes comfortable throughout the season.\nSafety Tips Inside the Home Columbia Gas advises customers to use space heaters cautiously, placing them on hard, non-flammable surfaces and keeping them away from furniture and other flammable materials. Homeowners are also encouraged to ensure furnaces, water heaters, and stoves are inspected regularly and operating according to manufacturer instructions.\nThe company warns against using ovens or stoves as heat sources and stresses that charcoal grills or generators should never be used indoors or in enclosed spaces. Fireplaces should only be used after chimneys are cleaned and checked for blockages at least once a year.\nOutdoor Precautions Customers are also urged to keep outdoor gas equipment clear of snow and ice. Intake and exhaust vents should remain unobstructed to prevent carbon monoxide buildup and appliance malfunctions. Gas meters should always be visible and accessible, and residents are reminded not to use shovels or hammers to remove ice—using a broom instead is recommended. Extra caution should also be taken when operating snow blowers or plows near gas meters.\nGas Leaks and Carbon Monoxide Concerns Columbia Gas emphasizes that safety should be the top priority if a gas leak or carbon monoxide (CO) exposure is suspected. Anyone who smells the distinctive “rotten egg” odor associated with natural gas should leave the area immediately and call 911 and Columbia Gas at 800-344-4077 .\nIf carbon monoxide buildup is suspected—especially if symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or unusual fatigue occur—residents should get outside immediately and call 911. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas produced when fuels burn incompletely.\nHelp with Heating Costs For customers struggling to pay their gas bills during the winter months, Columbia Gas encourages them to reach out for assistance. Payment plan options are available by calling 800-344-4077 , Monday through Friday, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nAdditional winter weather and gas safety information can be found at www.columbiagasohio.com .\nAbout Columbia Gas of Ohio Columbia Gas of Ohio provides natural gas service to approximately 1.5 million customers statewide and is the largest natural gas utility in Ohio. Headquartered in Columbus, the company is part of NiSource, one of the nation’s largest fully regulated utility companies, focused on delivering safe, reliable energy to communities across the state.",
