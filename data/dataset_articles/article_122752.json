  "text": "New outlooks from the Climate Prediction Center indicate a pronounced and persistent warm pattern developing across much of the United States over the next one to two weeks, including through the Christmas holiday . Both the 6–10 day and 8–14 day temperature outlooks show above-normal temperatures dominating the central and eastern portions of the country , signaling a sustained break from typical late-December cold.\nA large area of strongly above-average temperatures is forecast to build across the Plains, Midwest, and South, with the warmest anomalies centered from the central Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley. This warm ridge is expected to expand eastward as we head closer to Christmas.\nMid-Atlantic Focus\nFor the Mid-Atlantic region , including Delmarva, confidence is increasing in a milder-than-normal stretch of weather heading into and through the holiday period. Temperatures are favored to run above seasonal averages , with daytime highs frequently reaching the 50s and potentially near 60 degrees at times , depending on cloud cover and frontal timing. Overnight lows are also expected to remain milder, reducing the risk of prolonged cold snaps.\nWhile brief cool-downs remain possible as weak fronts pass through, no sustained Arctic air intrusions are currently indicated in the extended outlook. This pattern significantly lowers the chances for a widespread white Christmas across the Mid-Atlantic, with precipitation events more likely falling as rain rather than snow.\nLooking Ahead\nOverall, the pattern supports a quiet and relatively mild end to December for much of the eastern U.S. If this outlook holds, the Mid-Atlantic can expect a holiday season that feels more like late fall than mid-winter , with continued monitoring needed in case pattern shifts develop closer to Christmas.",
