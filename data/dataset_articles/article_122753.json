  "text": "Record Warmth Possible Around Christmas\nOKLAHOMA CITY (KOKH) — Temperatures will continue to remain warmer than average despite a few cold fronts passing through. This trend will continue for the week of Christmas where we could be looking at multiple days close to record highs!\nWe'll get a taste of that this weekend when Saturday's highs are able to rise into the upper 60s! Another cold front will knock the temperatures down for Sunday, but even the middle 50s would still be about 5 degrees warmer than normal.\nAfter that cold front, we then look to be very warm for next week with highs running into the 70s!\nWith a large ridge of high pressure keeping us warm, travel should be easy across most of the Lower 48!\nTemperatures leading up to Christmas could set new record high temperatures! Right now, we've got a high of 74 expected for Christmas Day, beating the record of 73 from 2016! It'll be great to be outside, but there's no chance of a White Christmas!\nThis warm trend will continue all the way towards the end of the month. Oklahoma is in the target area for the highest chances of being warmer than normal!\nTo stay up to date with the latest forecast, be sure to download the Fox 25 Weather App.\nStay with Fox 25, we've got your back!",
