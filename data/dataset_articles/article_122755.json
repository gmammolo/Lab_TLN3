  "text": "NorthWestern Energy Group, Inc. -1.45% Butte, Mont. - Dec. 18, 2025 - NorthWestern Energy crews made significant progress repairing damage and restoring power for customers affected by outages caused by the strong wind storm that swept across Montana on Wednesday.\nDangerous weather conditions required crews to pause work overnight in some areas, including Elk Park north of Butte and Lincoln.\nCrews were back in the field this morning and will continue working until all customers are restored.\nBy Thursday morning, service had been restored to more than 35,000 customers.\nIn Helena, crews worked through the night to restore power to the Helena Regional Airport.\nIn Superior, a generator was installed at the Town Pump convenience store to keep gasoline sales operating amid widespread outages along I-90 west of Missoula.\nCall volume to NorthWestern Energy's Customer Service Center on Wednesday alone was equivalent to a typical full month, underscoring the impact of the storm across the state and the increase in customer calls that were being responded to by customer service representatives working around the clock.\nFor the safety of our customers and communities, powerlines are being manually patrolled before being reenergized, which does result in a longer restoration time for some outages.\nWe appreciate customers' patience during this challenging event.\nSafety Reminder\nAs residents inspect their property after the storm, watch for downed power lines hidden under debris. Always assume any downed line is energized and dangerous-stay far away and report it immediately.\nCheck your meter mast and base\nHeavy windstorms can damage the meter bases and masts on homes and buildings.\nIf your meter base is damaged, you must contact a licensed electrician to make repairs before service can be restored safely.\nEven if damage is visible, never attempt to make repairs yourself. Service lines can carry up to 240 volts of electricity, which can cause severe injury or start a fire.\nRepairs can only be made by a licensed electrician.\nPrepare for Another Weather System\nA new weather system is forecast for Montana this evening, bringing snow and more wind. Montanans should monitor forecasts and prepare in advance:\nEnsure all electronic and mobile devices are fully charged. Charge portable power banks and other backup devices. Prepare an emergency outage kit with essentials. NorthWestern Energy is preparing with crews staffed, equipment and supplies ready to respond to any outages as quickly as possible, safely, to restore service.\nFor updates and safety information, visit https://www.northwesternenergy.com or follow NorthWestern Energy on social media.\nFollow us on Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram : @NorthWesternEnergy\nNorthWestern Energy - Delivering a Bright Future\nNorthWestern Energy, provides essential energy infrastructure and valuable services that enrich lives and empower communities while serving as long-term partners to our customers and communities.
