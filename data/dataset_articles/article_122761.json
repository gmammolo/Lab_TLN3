  "text": "UPDATED: Thursday, December 18, 2025 05:30 AM\nConditions It's going to be another awesome day for skiing and snowboarding with slightly warmer temperatures than yesterday. We are expecting mostly sunny skies with daytime highs near 68 and low of 51 with southwest winds around 10 mph.\nWith a total of 8 trails consisting of beginner to intermediate terrain, you can expect awesome groomed runs early in the morning. Conditions will likely change to loose granular snow and may be variable in some areas of the mountain. Please be aware of thin coverage and all marked and unmarked obstacles. Stay on open groomed trails and obey all posted signs. Available terrain is subject to change as conditions change. Be sure to pack a windbreaker, and come on up to Mountain High for a some mid-week fun!\nRoad Conditions Hwy 2 from Hwy 138 - OPEN with no restrictions. Largo Vista/Big Pines Hwy - OPEN with no restrictions.",
