  "text": "Canberrans planning an outdoor Christmas lunch can expect a mostly kind day from the weather – but anyone travelling interstate may want to keep one eye on the forecast.\nAccording to the Bureau of Meteorologyâ€™s latest Christmas Day outlook, Australia is in for a “varied” day, with everything from showers and possible storms on the east coast to hot, dry conditions in the west.\nFor the ACT, itâ€™s shaping up as a classic Canberra Christmas – dry, sunny and fairly mild.\nCanberra is forecast to be mostly sunny, with a minimum of 10 degrees and a top of 28 degrees.\nThe Bureau says maximum temperatures will be slightly below average, reaching the high 20s across the territory – good news for the prawns on the outdoor table.\nThose heading across the border into NSW will see similar conditions inland, but with more cloud and a few showers closer to the coast.\nAcross NSW, Christmas Day is expected to be “generally dry and mostly sunny”, with the risk of showers along the coast.\nMaximum temperatures will sit within a few degrees of the December average – low to mid 20s along the South Coast, rising to the high 20s on the North Coast.\nInland centres will be warmer, like Wagga Wagga, where the forecast is sunny, with a minimum of 11 degrees and a maximum of 28.\nBatemans Bay is tipped to reach 23 degrees, with a chance of a shower or two. Sydney is also forecast to see a shower or two, with a top of 28 degrees.\nTravelling even further afield? Conditions become more mixed.\nThe Bureau says it will be “relatively cool to mild across the far south-east”, with showers for western and northern Tasmania, but mostly dry for Victoria and South Australia.\nQueensland is likely to be wetter, with showers and storms forecast for large parts of the state, including the south-east and the tropical north.\nThe Bureau is reminding Australians that forecasts can still change as Christmas Day approaches, with conditions refined in the coming days.\nTravellers are being urged to stay up to date via the Bureauâ€™s website and BOM Weather app – particularly if storms are forecast along their route or at their destination.",
