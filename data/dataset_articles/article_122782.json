  "text": "How is it Friday already? Don’t get me wrong. I’m glad, but somehow my to-do list has multiplied overnight. Please tell me I’m not the only one in this “Where did the week go?” club. Christmas is just 6 days away, Hannukah is already on Day 6, and somewhere, a child is watching The Muppet Christmas Carol in 34 separate YouTube clips instead of doing… schoolwork? Speaking of which, my kids get a half day on Monday (don’t ask me why; only the gods…erm, board of management know), while other schools are sneaking in a half day today. Half day = school counts it as a full day, but we all know the real curriculum is binge-watching holiday specials.\nHigh pressure is bossing the skies today, though weak low pressure starts creeping in from Saturday.\nToday: Mostly clear skies, with a few clouds popping in here and there, especially in the west. Winds drift from southwest to northwest, weak to moderate at 3-4 Beaufort. Seas are calm to slightly rough. Temperatures are a cozy 19°C inland, 21°C along the coasts, and 10°C up in the mountains; mild enough to make you actually want to go outside… or at least peek out the window while sipping hot chocolate.\nTonight: Expect some local cloud cover, with winds hanging around 3 Beaufort and the sea keeping its calm-to-slightly-rough reputation.\nSaturday: Clouds stick around, gradually thickening in the afternoon, and isolated showers may join the party.\nSunday: Mainly cloudy with a chance of isolated showers. Expect clouds, isolated showers, and maybe an isolated thunderstorm on Monday.\nTemperature outlook: Through Monday, temps remain fairly steady, comfortably above the seasonal average, so at least the weather isn’t adding to the chaos.",
