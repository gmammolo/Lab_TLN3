  "text": "KUANTAN: The flood management operation in Pahang is running smoothly and remains under control despite an increase in the number of victims, says Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail.\nHe said relevant agencies have implemented operations and aid distribution at temporary relief centres (PPS) in an orderly manner to ensure the welfare of flood victims.\n“I see that everything is under control.\n“However, I do not deny that there may be slight delays in food preparation due to the rain. If this happens, it is usually within an hour and unavoidable.\n“The food will arrive,” he said in a Bernama report yesterday.\nWan Rosdy was speaking to reporters after visiting flood victims at the Dewan Orang Ramai Jaya Gading PPS here, which is housing 148 residents from 58 families.\nHe also advised the public not to spread unverified information that could cause worry to the families of victims who are outside the flood area.\n“We should give words of encouragement and avoid spreading information that is not helpful.”\nHe further reminded residents not to return to their homes without clearance from the authorities, for their own safety.\n“I find that the current flooding trend is increasing, but at a relatively slow rate.\n“We pray that the rain will stop soon and that the flood situation will improve,” he said.\nAccording to the Social Welfare Department’s Disaster Information Centre, 10,478 victims from 3,477 families have been placed in 77 PPS in Kuantan, Maran, Rompin, Pekan and Jerantut as of 2pm yesterday.",
