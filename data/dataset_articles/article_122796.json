  "text": "Petersburg got more snow in a week than all of last winter\nPeople who have been shoveling snow in central Southeast Alaska might feel a bit like Sisyphus, rolling his boulder uphill. But the heavy snowfall that buried many panhandle communities this past week is no myth.\nOver 40 inches of snow has fallen on Petersburg since Monday, Dec. 8. Edward Liske, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau, said that's already more than the town got all of last winter.\nSixteen inches of snow fell in Petersburg on Sunday, Dec. 14, breaking the local record for that date by six inches. It was the second local daily record broken within the week.\nIn an interview Monday morning, Liske said Wrangell and Kake saw significant snowfall over the weekend, too. Wrangell got about nine inches of snow, and Liske said \"Kake is getting buried as well,\" with reports of over a foot of snow falling in a single night.\nThe weather service recorded a total of 2.5 inches of new snow in Petersburg on Monday. Liske noted \"it's still a lot of snow\" for the town; the average amount of daily snowfall, according to decades of recorded data, is around half an inch.\nThe school district got a snow day on Monday, Dec. 15, and some small local businesses closed or opened late. The Borough offices closed, but some departments like public works, police, and emergency services continued operating.\nPetersburg's Mayor Bob Lynn canceled the Borough Assembly meeting that was scheduled for Monday night; agenda items will be carried forward to the Jan. 5 meeting. The Tidal Network community listening session scheduled for Tuesday night, Dec. 16, has been canceled by the Central Council of the Tlingit & Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska.\nLiske said the main band of snow moved north. Juneau got several inches of snow over the weekend, and several more on Monday, breaking its local daily record for Dec. 15 with 9.2 inches of snow. Juneau's previous record for that date was 8.7 inches.\nLooking ahead, Liske said snowfall is expected to diminish in the panhandle. Residual, intermittent snow showers are forecast for northern Prince of Wales Island and into Kupreanof Island. A couple more inches of snow could fall this week in Petersburg and nearby communities, but it won't be as heavy.\n\"It's not going to be the snowpocalypse that you had recently,\" he said with a laugh.\nThe recent heavy snowfall on the panhandle followed a warm and wet previous two months. Then December brought a cold snap.\n\"The cold looks like it's going to be here to stay, at least through the rest of the month here,\" Liske said. \"Be prepared for possibly more snow and cold temperatures.\"\nUnless temperatures warm up, which is unlikely, Liske said Southeast communities like Petersburg are set to have a white Christmas.\nThis story was first published at kfsk.org and is reprinted here with permission.",
