  "text": "SAN ANTONIO — With an estimated 8.7 million Texans expected to hit the road for Christmas, gas prices continue to fall at the perfect time.\nAccording to AAA Texas, the average price for a gallon of regular gas at Lone Star State station stands at $2.51 as we approach the weekend—nearly 40 cents cheaper than the national average, which is at $2.89.\nThere's even better news for San Antonio drivers: Only Houston beats San Antonio when it comes to gas prices in the state's major metropolitan areas. A gallon of regular gas there runs drivers $2.43 a gallon compared to $2.50 in the Alamo City.\n>>Average cost of regular gas in major Texas cities as of Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025:\n- El Paso: $2.80 a gallon\n- Dallas: $2.64\n- Austin-San Marcos: $2.53\n- San Antonio: $2.50\n- Houston: $2.43\n>>Average cost of diesel gas in major Texas cities as of Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025:\n- El Paso: $3.39 a gallon\n- Dallas: $3.25\n- Austin-San Marcos: $3.17\n- San Antonio: $3.14\n- Houston: $3.07\nSan Antonio drivers are getting more relief at the pump compared a week ago, to the tune of seven cents less for a gallon of regular. We're also paying 20 cents less a gallon compared to a year ago, in case you were looking for a reason to treat yourself further for Christmas this year.",
