  "text": "Sending warmth out into the community: Trinity's Closet and their ministry\n- Updated\n0\nWeather Alert\n...Much Colder Temperatures and Localized Travel Impacts This Evening into Friday Morning... Temperatures will plummet from the 30s and 40s into the teens and 20s behind another cold front passage early this evening, along with west-northwest winds gusting up to 40-45 mph in the wake of the front. Scattered wind-whipped snow showers later this evening into the overnight may lead to brief sharply reduced visibility and produced localized coatings of snow on some roadways. Furthermore, the plummeting temperatures may also cause any moisture on pavement to freeze up, leading to slick spots on untreated roadways and sidewalks. Finally, temperatures will continue to fall into early Friday, pairing with still blustery west-northwest winds to yield wind chills of around 0 to 10 below. Motorists should plan for potentially hazardous driving conditions this evening into Friday morning. Any individuals planning to spend time outdoors late tonight through Friday morning should dress in layers and cover their extremities.\nCurrently in Rockford\n27°F\nCloudy/Wind\n45°F / 27°F\n7 PM\n26°F\n8 PM\n23°F\n9 PM\n20°F\n10 PM\n19°F\n11 PM\n17°F",
