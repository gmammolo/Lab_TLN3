Stand up for truth and for LAist. Make your year-end tax-deductible gift now.\nStorm heading for SoCal just in time for Christmas week\nTopline:\nAn atmospheric river is expected to hit Southern California next week, bringing several inches of rain to the region — just in time for Christmas.\nWhy it matters: The moderate to strong storm could dump 2 to 4 inches of rain on L.A., Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, while the mountains and foothills could see double that amount.\nWhy now: The storm is expected to peak Tuesday evening into Christmas Eve, according to the National Weather Service, lingering into Thursday and Christmas Day.\nThe details: Bryan Lewis, a meteorologist with the NWS Oxnard office, said forecasters also are expecting gusty winds across the region, along with a chance of thunderstorms.\nConfidence is high in a return of rain to Southwest California next week with rainfall likely peaking Christmas Eve thru Christmas Day (Dec 24-25). While the most likely outcomes are shown in the graphic, there is still some uncertainty with the details. Stay tuned.\n— NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles)[#LARain][#CAwx][pic.twitter.com/MudoabhNm4][December 17, 2025]\nWhat's next: There’s also a growing potential for moderate to heavy showers continuing into next weekend, although Lewis said the details and timing could change as the storm approaches.\nGo deeper: Why your skis and snowboard might not get much of a workout this winter",
