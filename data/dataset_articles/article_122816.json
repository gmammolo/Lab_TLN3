  "text": "Shorts in December? Albuquerque sees record-breaking winter warmth\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – Albuquerque and much of New Mexico are experiencing near record-breaking warmth this December, with temperatures feeling more like spring than winter.\nLight cotton zip-ups, sunshine, and fishing poles were seen at Tingley Beach in southwest Albuquerque on a December day. Residents have been surprised by the unusual weather.\n“It’s kind of weird because it’s mid-December, so we’d expect some snow or something, but it’s not like it used to be,” said one local. “Other than that, it’d be sweaters and everything, hoodies up. But now it’s T-shirts, shorts.”\n“I’ve lived in Albuquerque my whole life, but it’s definitely a lot warmer this year than it has been in other years,” another resident said.\nAcross New Mexico, high temperatures are running 10 to 20 degrees above normal, breaking December records in several areas. Forecasters say the warmth could stick around through Christmas.\nWarmth continues\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), New Mexico has warmed more than 2 degrees since the early 1900s. The last decade has been the warmest on record for the state.\n“If you can imagine 80 degrees going on in December, it’s been quite something, yeah, and it’s been going on so the end, really all month,” said Hergert. “We’re expecting to continue really through, at least through Christmas and probably well into the week after Christmas, and a lot of places, if they’re not setting records, they’re still 15 to 20 degrees above normal for this time of year.”\nThe state has also seen an increase in extremely hot days and warm nights over the past several decades, especially in the eastern plains. Winter temperatures, on average, are trending warmer, too.\nMeteorologists say while seasonal swings are still possible, this warmer-than-normal pattern is expected to continue into the holiday week.",
