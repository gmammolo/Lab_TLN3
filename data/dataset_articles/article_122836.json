  "text": "While the wind and snow put on an epic — at times scary — show on Wednesday, officials heard few reports of issues throughout Dawson County, telling them people heeded the risks of being out and about during the blizzard.\nAccording to information from the National Weather Service station in Glasgow, wind gusts reached as high as 80 mph in Bloomfield. An area east of Glendive reported gusts of 66 mph, meanwhile the airport reported those up to 78 mph.\nMoreover, NWS meteorologist Ted Jamba noted the air temperature in Glendive was above 0 degrees Fahrenheight for the duration of the blizzard — 5 degrees — but the windchill dropped as low as minus 22 degrees around 2 a.m. Thursday.\nAs the wind gradually picked up speed Wednesday evening, the snow started to fly at 7:24 p.m., with the heaviest snow between 9:35 p.m. and 12:35 a.m. on Thursday. Jamba said the snow reportedly ended around 5 a.m. alongside diminished wind speeds.\nDespite the high wind speeds and heavy snow causing severe blizzard conditions for multiple hours, Dawson County Disaster and Emergency Services Coordinator Mary Jo Gehnert did not receive a single phone call regarding any major impacts, excluding a few downed trees, broken windows and small power outages.\n“That’s good news,” she said, nonetheless adding the conditions were unique for the middle of December. “It was vicious for this time of year.”\nAnd Dawson County was not the only area blasted with the wicked blizzard, rather most communities across Montana were hit with the same or worse conditions.\nAccording to Jamba, that is likely due to what was classified as an Alberta clipper system, a fast-moving low-pressure system coming down from Canada heading southeast.\n“On the back side ... came the arctic front that initiated snow and it continued for the area,” he said.\n“It was almost universal across the state,” Jamba added. “It caused tens of thousands of people to be without power.”\nThe Glendive Fire Department and West Glendive Fire Department were both dispatched to downed lines at the blizzard’s peak.\nGFD quickly dealt with a line holding Christmas decorations that broke and layed across Towne Street.\nMeanwhile, a power line in the parking lot at the Trail Star Truck Stop fell on top of some parked semi trucks, leading the WGFD to block the entrances until Montana-Dakota Utilities could respond.\n“We just gated off the area there and made sure no one was inside those trucks,” WGFD Chief Brad Sharbono said. “It was pretty uneventful compared to what it sounded like some of our neighbors went through.”\nEven so, MDU did not have much else to deal with in the Glendive area, rather more damaged occurred north in Savage and Sidney. Crews were still working into Thursday afternoon to restore power to those communities.\n“In the Glendive area, there were a few small outages, but everything has been restored,” Jamie Tescher, MDU senior public relations representative, said.\nAs of Thursday, the NWS advised of a winter weather advisory that was expected to bring some ice accumulations and other winter conditions through Friday.\nLet the news come to you\nGet our free email newsletters — latest headlines and e-edition notifications.",
