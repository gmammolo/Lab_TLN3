  "text": "Snowmobilers enjoying the intense winter so far\nParts of Central New York have already seen several feet of snow so far.\nThis is before the technical start date of winter.\nThis isn't a given in December. For snowmobilers, this means early access to the trails.\nMore snow means more time for many to utilize their snowmobiles.\nThis generates additional business for those working in the snowmobile industry.\nOn the maintenance and retail side of the business, many have had a busy start to the season.\nKyle Conover, the owner's son at KDK Sports, said, \"Service is jam-packed right now.\"\nAlthough this year has been a good snowmobile season so far, previous years, besides last, haven't been as snowy.\n\"Last year was super busy,\" explained Conover. \"Years prior, they weren't, and people weren't as thrilled with the conditions.\"\nSnowmobile trails were empty on Thursday in Oswego County. Many of them were closed due to the warm weather. For many restaurants in the county, those trails are how patrons get to the businesses throughout the winter months. The impact is huge.",
