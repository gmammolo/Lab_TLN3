  "text": "The Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr. Velenkosini Hlabisa Urges Heightened Vigilance as Above-Normal Rainfall and Thunderstorms Are Expected During the Festive Season\nCurrent forecasts indicate above-normal rainfall over the central and eastern regions of South Africa, with a mix of warm to cool conditions across the country. The Highveld is expected to experience frequent afternoon thunderstorms on most days, while the eastern provinces face a 30–60% chance of afternoon thunderstorms as Christmas and the New Year approach.\nWhile rainfall is welcome in many areas, these conditions increase the risk of flooding, lightning, strong winds and reduced visibility on roads. Communities, holidaymakers and travellers are urged to remain alert and take necessary precautions.\nThe Minister advises the public to:\n- Closely monitor official weather updates and heed warnings issued by authorities.\n- Avoid crossing flooded roads, bridges and low-lying areas.\n- Secure homes, informal structures and loose items that may be affected by strong rainfall and winds\n- Stay indoors where possible or exercise extra caution when travelling, particularly during thunderstorms.\n- Keep children and other vulnerable loved ones away from swollen rivers, streams and open water.\n- Promptly report weather-related emergencies to local disaster management centres.\n“As families travel and gather to celebrate the festive season, safety must remain a priority. We urge everyone to act responsibly, remain vigilant and cooperate with local authorities to prevent avoidable loss of life and damage,” said Minister Hlabisa.\nThe department of Cogta working with provincial and municipal disaster management centres, remains on high alert and ready to respond to any weather-related incidents.\nMembers of the public are encouraged to stay informed, remain vigilant and celebrate the festive season safely.\nFor media enquiries, kindly contact:\nMs Pearl Maseko-Binqose\nMedia Liaison Officer to the Minister of CoGTA\nCell: +27 (82) 772 1709\nMr Legadima Leso\nHead of Communications, CoGTA\nCell: +27 (66) 479 9904\n#GvoZAUpdates",
