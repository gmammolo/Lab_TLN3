  "text": "A Turn Toward Sunshine and Comfortable Days Ahead\nSARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Today will be the transition day as drier air moves in behind the departing front. Skies will be partly sunny, and it will feel noticeably more comfortable than the past couple of days. Afternoon temperatures climb to around 82 degrees. Winds start out of the west to southwest at 5 to 10 mph, then shift to the northwest during the afternoon.\nTonight stays quiet and mild, with partly cloudy skies and lows near 53. A light north breeze around 5 mph will continue overnight.\nSaturday looks bright and pleasant. Sunshine dominates, with afternoon highs near 79 degrees. An east-northeast breeze around 10 mph keeps things feeling comfortable. Saturday night will be partly cloudy and mild, with lows near 57. Winds ease and become nearly calm during the evening.\nSunday continues the stretch of nice weather. Expect mostly sunny skies and warmer afternoon temperatures, reaching about 82 degrees. Winds will be light, starting calm and becoming northeast around 6 mph later in the morning. Sunday night remains quiet with partly cloudy skies and lows near 58, along with a light northeast breeze.\nThe calm, dry pattern holds into next week. Monday will be sunny and warm, with highs around 81 and clear to mostly clear skies Monday night. Lows dip into the upper 50s. Tuesday brings more sunshine and highs near 80, followed by another mostly clear and mild night with lows around 57.
