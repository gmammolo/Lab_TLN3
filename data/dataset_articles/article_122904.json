  "text": "Lightning strikes Burj Khalifa. Dubai Crown Prince captures rare moment in viral video\nA literally striking video posted by Dubai's Crown Prince shows lightning hitting the Burj Khalifa amid severe storms. The video is viral.\nA literally striking video of lightning hitting the Burj Khalifa during a heavy rainstorm has gone viral after being shared by Dubai's Crown Prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.\nSheikh Hamdan posted the video on Instagram, simply captioning it with \"Dubai' and a cloud with rain and a high voltage symbol emoji. The post quickly gained traction online, with many viewers expressing amazement at the rare natural event captured so vividly.\nSheikh Hamdan is known for his enthusiasm for photography and nature, often sharing images and videos with his followers. In addition to his role as Crown Prince, he serves as the UAE's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. He became Crown Prince of Dubai in 2008 after serving as Deputy Ruler.\nWatch the video here:\nThe incident took place as the United Arab Emirates experienced unstable weather conditions. The National Centre of Meteorology has issued warnings for rain, thunder, lightning, and hail across several regions in the country, as confirmed by local media reports.\nAccording to the National Centre of Meteorology, the UAE entered the peak phase of the 'Al Bashayer' low-pressure system on December 18, resulting in heavy rainfall and storm warnings.\nThe video of the lightning strike was widely shared across various social media platforms. Many users noted the impressive sight of the lightning bolt connecting with the Burj Khalifa, underlining the skyscraper’s prominence and the rarity of such an occurrence.\nThe Burj Khalifa, standing at 829.8 meters in Dubai, holds the distinction of being the world’s tallest freestanding structure, and having the highest occupied floor. Its unique stature makes it a frequent focal point for notable natural events in the city.",
