  "text": "It'll be a beautiful, cool wrap up to the week with temperatures sitting in the low 60s through the middle of the afternoon.\nSkies will remain clear into the weekend with a couple of nice sunny days in a row before the clouds return on Sunday.\nWe'll get another chilly night tonight as lows drop into the 40s but much more mild weather will set up over the weekend.\nA few light showers and cloudy skies are expected on Sunday but that will be it for a little while with mostly sunny skies expected through Christmas week.",
