  "text": "Shreveport, LA – Residents across the Four State Region are enjoying a pleasant December day Friday, with mild temperatures and calm weather setting the stage for an unseasonably warm and dry Christmas week, according to the National Weather Service in Shreveport.\nForecasters say daytime highs today will range from the upper 50s to mid-60s, with overnight lows dipping only into the upper 30s to mid-40s. These readings are near to slightly above normal for mid-December, making for comfortable outdoor conditions across much of East Texas, North Louisiana, South Arkansas, and Southeast Oklahoma.\nLooking ahead, the warming trend is expected to intensify. According to the National Weather Service, near-record warmth is forecast to spread across the region during the week of Christmas, with temperatures running well above normal for late December. Long-range outlooks indicate highs climbing even higher beginning Tuesday and continuing through at least Friday of next week.\nIn addition to the warmer temperatures, very dry conditions are expected to dominate the forecast. Little to no measurable rainfall is anticipated, which could contribute to increasing dryness across the region as the holiday week progresses.\nWeather outlook maps released by the National Weather Service show a strong signal for above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation, a combination more typical of early fall than late December.\nWhile the warm, dry weather may be welcome for holiday travel and outdoor plans, officials note that prolonged dry conditions could elevate fire weather concerns if winds increase later in the month.\nResidents are encouraged to continue monitoring local forecasts as Christmas approaches, especially if making travel or outdoor plans.\nDoes this warm December feel unusual where you live? Share how the weather compares to past Christmases.",
