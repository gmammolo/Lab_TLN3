  "text": "By Anita McSorley Michael D. Carroll ,\n12 minutes ago Ireland may be set for a wintry surprise this week, as fresh weather maps suggest snow could return to certain areas ahead of Christmas.\nFollowing weeks of r elentless rain and blustery conditions , Met Eireann has announced a major change, stating that \"more settled weather will develop early next week\". That said, unsettled conditions are still expected in the coming days. Tomorrow is predicted to stay \"wet and windy\", with heavy downpours potentially causing spot flooding in certain locations.\nOvernight showers are due to move eastwards, bringing hail, with temperatures dropping as low as 3C . Friday has been characterized as \"blustery\" and Saturday as \"breezy\", while Sunday will bring a marked chill, with daytime temperatures barely climbing above 5C to 8C, reports the Irish Mirror .\n• Massachusetts to be smashed by 60 mph winds and horror downpours in wild weather blast\n• Polar vortex split and bomb cyclone bring Arctic blast to New York\nAttention is now shifting to the festive season, with Met Eireann confirming a distinct temperature drop and predicting conditions will be \"cooler, drier and more settled through Christmas week.\"\nWhile the official forecast doesn't currently reference snow, the most recent weather maps have turned white. This suggests wintry precipitation could sweep across portions of the nation this week.\nWestern counties may experience the initial flurries as soon as Thursday night, with another potential round of wintry showers hitting the southwest on Sunday afternoon.\nThough these projections are famously prone to revision, they've sparked optimism for a White Christmas in Ireland.\nBookmakers are seeing a spike in customers placing wagers on snow falling next Thursday.\nDublin has experienced a significant shift, with odds for snow at the airport slashed to 7/2 from 6/1, while Belfast's prospects have doubled in likelihood, now standing at 5/2.\nMoving further west, Donegal also remains a contender at 4/1, while Kerry and Shannon airports are considered longer shots at 9/1 and 8/1 respectively.\nBoyle Sports spokesperson Lawrence Lyons said: \"Weather experts are divided, but punters are definitely dreaming of a White Christmas this year.\nThe odds have been falling faster than the temperatures and Belfast is a big mover, with Dublin not far behind.\"",
