  "text": "Happy Friday! Expect a warm humid day. Lows are in the mid-70s with highs reaching near record-warmth the mid-80s. There is a southwest wind as we are waiting for a weak front to move in later Friday. Once the front clears, South Florida will be slightly cooler thanks to the shift in the wind direction. Saturday morning lows will be back into the 60s. Have a great weekend!\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
