  "text": "KUANTAN, Dec 19 (Bernama) -- Flood victims took advantage of the good weather today to return to their respective homes to carry out clean-up work after floods hit several areas in the district since Monday.\nPrivate sector worker Muhammad Adhar Tarmizi, 30, said he and five family members returned home at 8 am yesterday from the relief centre to clean their house after the floodwaters fully receded.\nHe said the furniture was damaged, while electrical appliances, including a TV, refrigerator, and washing machine, could not be tested as power has not been fully restored.\n“We tried to save whatever we could, but the damaged furniture had to be thrown away. Although we are exhausted, we feel somewhat relieved to be able to return home after nearly three days at the relief centre,” he told Bernama at Taman Seri Damai here today.\nMeanwhile, snack food vendor Syafirudin Ismail, 27, said he had made early preparations by storing his merchandise in a safe location and installing flood barriers to protect his furniture.\n“All my furniture is in good condition, and my merchandise was secured in advance, even though the floodwaters entered the house very quickly,” he told Bernama at the PR1MA Sungai Karang housing area here today.\nSyafirudin said the recent flood was the third in four months but reached only ankle height, far less severe than November’s nearly four-foot surge.\nMeanwhile, Pahang Civil Defence Force (APM) director, Colonel (PA) Che Adam A Rahman, who is also the Pahang State Disaster Management Secretariat, said the number of flood victims is declining and is expected to continue to decrease over the next few days if weather conditions remain favourable.\nHe also advised residents returning home, including those in villages and housing estates, to check their houses carefully for flood debris, sharp objects, or venomous animals.\nHe said APM will continue operations to assist residents and urged those in high-risk districts, Temerloh, Maran, Bera, and Pekan, to evacuate early if Sungai Pahang rises and floods residential areas.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2025 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",
