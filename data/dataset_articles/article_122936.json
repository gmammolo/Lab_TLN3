  "text": "By Cody Nickel ,\n1 hours ago\nCOLUMBUS, Ga. (WRBL) — Good Friday morning! Overnight rain showers have moved out of the region, making way for drier conditions as the day begins. As a cold front passes through, winds will pick up and become breezy through the morning hours. Early temperatures will feel chilly, dipping into the mid to upper 40s around daybreak.\nBehind the front, today will be slightly cooler overall, with afternoon highs reaching the upper 50s. Sunshine will dominate the sky, but expect a persistent breeze at times, with winds occasionally gusting between 15 and 20 mph—adding an extra chill to the air.\nTonight, bundle up once again. Clear skies and calm conditions will allow temperatures to fall toward the freezing mark, setting the stage for another cold start on Saturday morning. The good news? This cold spell won’t last long.\nBy Saturday, temperatures will rebound nicely, climbing into the low 60s under mostly sunny skies. Even warmer air arrives for the official start of winter on Sunday, with highs reaching the mid 60s—about five degrees above average for this time of year.\nLooking ahead to next week, the warming trend continues. As we approach Christmas Day, temperatures are expected to turn unseasonably warm, with daytime highs running 10 to 15 degrees above average.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
