  "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Today in Jacksonville, you’ll enjoy partly cloudy skies with mild temperatures, with highs climbing into the mid-70s and pleasant conditions for outdoor activities.\nOvernight lows will dip into the lower 40s, so a light jacket might be welcome if you’re out late.\nThrough the weekend into Sunday, the weather stays cool and sunny, with highs generally in the upper 60s to low 70s and crisp mornings around the 40s and low 50s — perfect for a sunny stroll or running holiday errands.\nAs we head into next week, the mild trend continues with mostly sunny to partly sunny skies, daytime highs rising toward the low to mid-70s and comfortable nights in the 50s.\nBy Christmas Day (Thursday, Dec. 25), expect pleasant, partly sunny weather with highs near 75–76°F and overnight lows in the mid-50s, great conditions for holiday plans outdoors or holiday travel without any big storms in sight.\nCopyright 2025 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.",
