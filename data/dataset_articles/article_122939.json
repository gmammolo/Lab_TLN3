  "text": "On Wednesday morning, parts of Britain were treated to a striking spectacle as the skies took on a gentle pink hue, created by the sun illuminating layers of widespread fog. This captivating atmospheric phenomenon was observed across significant areas, particularly in central and northern England, where the Met Office had earlier issued a yellow warning regarding the fog’s persistence, advising that it would likely linger until 10am.\nThe pink fog developed following an overnight drop in temperatures, leading to the formation of particularly dense patches in regions such as the East Midlands and Cambridgeshire. This unusual weather condition resulted in poor visibility, prompting concerns about challenging travel conditions for commuters and motorists.\nFog itself is a type of cloud that forms close to the ground, composed of countless tiny water droplets suspended in the air. The intriguing pink hue arises when these droplets scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight—such as blues and greens—more effectively than the longer red wavelengths, which then dominate the observed color. This effect is typically visible during sunrise and sunset when the sun is low on the horizon, causing its rays to traverse more of the atmosphere compared to midday sunlight, which is brighter and less filtered.\nA spokesperson from the Met Office explained the phenomenon, stating, “Fog is essentially a cloud at ground level made up of tiny water droplets. When the sun is low on the horizon, its light travels through more of the atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths are scattered out, leaving the longer red wavelengths to dominate. When this filtered light shines through fog, it gives the fog a pink or rosy hue.”\nAdding to the visual charm was a scene in Dunsden, Oxfordshire, where the dewdrops on spider webs glistened in the enveloping pink fog at sunrise, enhancing the fairy-tale quality of the landscape.\nDespite the enchanting appearance, the spokesperson emphasized that the pink fog is solely an optical effect rather than an indicator of unusual weather patterns. It poses similar risks as typical fog, primarily reduced visibility.\nInstances of pink fog have been recorded in the UK previously, including a notable occurrence in 2019 across parts of south-west England. However, Dr. Claire Ryder, an associate professor at the University of Reading, noted that the conditions necessary for the effect to arise are quite rare.\n“The effect is caused by a reddish sunrise being ‘filtered’ by the fog,” she explained. “The sunrise produces the red light by removing the bluer colours, and then the small fog droplets scatter the light more, dimming the effect and giving it a muted pink glow. It’s quite interesting and rare: you need the fog to occur at the exact sunrise or sunset time, and also for the fog to consist of a perfect thickness, or droplet concentration and droplet size, to get the right effect. Too thick a fog would block out all the light, and too thin a fog wouldn’t mute the sunrise colours very much.”\nAs the day progressed, the stunning sight of pink fog served as a reminder of the unique interplay between atmospheric conditions and light, bringing a moment of beauty to the early morning landscape of Britain.",
