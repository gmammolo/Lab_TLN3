  "text": "KUANTAN: Flood victims took advantage of the good weather on Friday (Dec 19) to return to their respective homes to carry out clean-up work after floods hit several areas in the district since Monday (Dec 15).\nPrivate sector worker Muhammad Adhar Tarmizi, 30, said he and five family members returned home at 8am on Thursday (Dec 18) from the relief centre to clean their house after the floodwaters fully receded.\nHe said the furniture was damaged, while electrical appliances, including a TV, refrigerator, and washing machine, could not be tested as power has not been fully restored.\n\"We tried to save whatever we could, but the damaged furniture had to be thrown away.\n\"Although we are exhausted, we feel somewhat relieved to be able to return home after nearly three days at the relief centre,” he told Bernama at Taman Seri Damai here on Friday.\nMeanwhile, snack food vendor Syafirudin Ismail, 27, said he had made early preparations by storing his merchandise in a safe location and installing flood barriers to protect his furniture.\n\"All my furniture is in good condition, and my merchandise was secured in advance, even though the floodwaters entered the house very quickly,” he told Bernama at the PR1MA Sungai Karang housing area here on Friday.\nSyafirudin said the recent flood was the third in four months but reached only ankle height, far less severe than November’s nearly four-foot surge. — Bernama",
