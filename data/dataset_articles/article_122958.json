  "text": "WOAY-TV (Oak Hill, WV): After some loud and strong thunderstorms and showers moved through last night, wet and windy conditions will continue through the morning. A switch from rain to a wintery mix is expected thanks to the cold front that has passed up by, dropping temperatures below freezing this morning. These showers will also bring gusty winds to the region. Conditions will calm down in the afternoon as cloudy skies remain through the day. There will be little to no accumulation with the exception of our high mountains, which will receive an inch or two of snow. This system will be the last active weather we experience for a few days, making for a great weekend ahead.\nThe weekend will be off to a great start with mostly sunny skies. Temperatures will start off cold before rising into the upper 40s and lower 50s tomorrow afternoon. High pressure in the region will keep any moisture and instability out of the region for Saturday and Sunday. However, it won’t keep a cold front out of the way on Sunday. While no precipitation is expected across our region on Sunday, temperatures will drop about 10 degrees compared to Saturday afternoon. The nicer conditions will even last into Monday of next week, but that will be the end of the inactive weather pattern.\nMonday night will bring us our first glimpse into the next active pattern for our region. A group of showers will bring rain and a wintery mix Monday night into Tuesday morning before switching back to all rain in the afternoon. From there, rainfall will be in and out of the region all the way through Christmas Day. This will not bring a White Christmas, but will bring its much more depressing cousin, a Wet Christmas. Here’s your 7-Day Forecast:",
