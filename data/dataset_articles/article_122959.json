  "text": "Mumbai residents are experiencing a welcome respite from the recent chill, as the intensity of cold weather has diminished in recent days. Although nights and early mornings remain cool, daytime temperatures have shifted to more pleasant levels.\nAccording to weather , the cold waves originating from northern India have lost strength, leading to a modest easing of chilly conditions throughout Maharashtra.\nIn various cities across the state, minimum temperatures that previously dipped below 10 degrees Celsius have begun to climb. That said, certain areas in Marathwada and Vidarbha continue to grapple with ongoing cold wave effects.\nALSO READ : Ram Sutar, Veteran Sculptor Behind Statue of Unity, Dies at 100 in Noida\nThe report also noted disruptions elsewhere in the country, with dense fog and reduced visibility severely impacting operations at Delhi’s airport on Thursday. Airlines canceled a total of 27 flights, and officials from Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) attributed the issues primarily to the low visibility conditions.\nThis gradual warming trend in Mumbai signals a return to more typical December weather patterns for the coastal metropolis, offering comfort to locals after the brief spell of sharper cold.",
