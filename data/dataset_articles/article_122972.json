  "text": "Early winter weather could help set Marble Mountain up for a good season\nSteady Brook resort hasn’t set an opening date yet but is hopeful early snow will help season\nIf there’s anyone who is happy with all the snow that’s fallen on the west coast since the start of December, it’s Richard Cormier.\n“Some of us dream about the first snowflake after the last one falls,” Cormier, the new general manager of Marble Mountain Resort, told The Telegram recently.\n“Any snow is great snow for us.”\nWith that said, Cormier said the Steady Brook resort still has to rely a lot on its own snowmaking, “but every snowflake that falls is something that we don’t have to spend to make.”\nSo far, December has been colder than it has been in recent years, and that’s helping with snowmaking efforts.\nUp to Friday, Dec. 12, Marble had its snowmaking machines in operation for four days.\nThere was a little mild spell during that, but things quickly cooled down, and by Monday, Dec. 15, the region was hit with another heavy snowfall.\nThat’s all good for the resort, which has had to deal with poor winter conditions that resulted in later openings and shorter seasons in the past few years.\n“I would say that it’s probably a little bit more of traditional weather,” Cormier said.\n“It feels a little bit more sort of winter on the west coast, the way it used to be. Even some of our long-time snowmakers say it just feels a bit more like it’s supposed to.”\nEven with an early snowfall, Cormier said it’s still a bit too early to set an opening date, but added the resort will open as soon as it can.\n“The hill’s goal was always to be open on Boxing Day. There were some years we got there, and then there were lots of years where we didn’t,” he said.\n“A lot of it depends on Mother Nature and temperatures. Our goal is always to be open as soon as we can safely for the public.”\nWeather may be on the hill’s side this year\nMeteorologist Eddie Sheerr said he doesn’t think Mother Nature will be as much of a hindrance to Marble as she’s been in previous years.\n“It certainly has been a good start to winter. Really, across the province, it’s been colder this December than I think we’ve seen for the last few years,” he said.\nOn Thursday, Dec. 18, Sheerr said the west coast could expect to see a bit of a warm spell coming in on Friday, Dec. 19.\nHe said it will get significantly warmer on Saturday, Dec. 20, with temperatures reaching between 8°C and 10°C.\n“The cold air comes back in by Sunday, Dec. 21,” said Sheerr, adding that there’s potential for another warmup on Monday, Dec. 22.\n“And then once we get into Christmas week, it does look like we’re getting into a colder pattern for an extended period of time. At least for a week or so, which for Marble should be good, obviously.\n“They shouldn’t lose all the snow with the warmup, and if anything, the thaw-freeze should give them a bit of a base, at least on parts of the mountain,” he said.\n“Then with the more consistent cold settling in for Christmas week, that’s enough with some snow to kind of get things rolling up there.”\nSheerr said the long-range forecast is hard to predict, but most of the ones he’s looked at going into winter seem to lean towards a colder second half of winter for the west coast, similar to what it’s seen in the last couple of years.\n“That would kind of be backloaded with snow,” said Sheerr.\nA new season\nBeing a business that depends on the weather, Cormier said Marble knows that’s something it can’t control.\n“We can only control the things that are around us and make sure people are around to enjoy it. We need support within the community, and we need support of the local businesses, and we need to support the community and the businesses as well.”\nAs Marble prepares for the possibility of a better season, it’s putting a push on attracting people to the hill. Part of that includes offering passes at a much-discounted early bird rate.\nSeason pass holders from last winter will also be able to avail of a special rebate on top of the early bird discount.\nThe discounted prices will be available until Dec. 31, then the cost goes up.\nEarly bird passes\n$399 for adults, ages 22 and up\n$199 for youth, ages six to 21\n$20 for ages five and under (all plus HST)\nAnyone over 80 skies for free\nCormier said the early bird rates have been well received among skiers and snowboarders.\n“Sales have been really good, they’ve been strong so far, and we’re pleased where the numbers are.”\nThe resort has seen an approximate 40 per cent increase in pass sales so far this season.\nGet your money’s worth\nAdult early bird passes pay off in just 7 days of riding\nYouth early bird passes pay off in only 4.5 days of riding\n“We really couldn’t drop the prices without the support from the Department of Tourism, and it was really a lot about getting families and kids back enjoying the winter. So, it was just about making it feasible to get some people back to the hill,” said Cormier.\nDown two lifts for season\nThis winter, access to the resort’s 39 trails will be via the Lightning Express ski lift and the magic carpets in the beginner area.\nThe Newfie Bullett and Black Mariah lifts are out of commission for the season, but Cormier said that’s not a concern.\n“The Lightning Express can handle well over 2,000 people an hour. So, it’s more than capable of meeting all our needs capacity-wise.”\nHe said the Lightning Express provides full access to the hill.\n“We have a trail that takes us from the west side to the east side, which is called the Upalong. It’s a bit of a skate to sort of get across, or a push to get across it, but that’s not uncommon for a lot of hills to have a similar trail,” he said.\n“We understand that people are absolutely disappointed in the Newfie Bullett not running, and we’ll do a complete feasibility study to see if we can operate it again and what’s going to be required,” he said.\nSomething for everyone\nThe resort is also bringing back a tube park this winter.\n“We’re going to focus on the ski and snowboard product first, and once we get that dialed in, then we’re going to start tubing,” he said.\n“It’ll be in the beginner area of the mountain, so it’ll be walkable from the base of the lodge.”\nThe plan is to offer tubing on Friday or Saturday evenings, or both if there is a demand.\n“It should be a great evening for people to get back to enjoying the outdoors,” he said.\nHe also said there will be a local vendor in the coffee shop, which will be a big hit with people.\nIn terms of special events, Cormier said the resort will play host to all the things people have come to love, including the uphill drags, Jibfest Weekend and winter carnival and St. Patrick’s day events. But first up is a special New Year’s Eve event featuring The Cover Girls.",
