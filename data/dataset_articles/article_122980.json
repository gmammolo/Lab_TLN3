  "text": "Happy Friday Crossroads! One last beautiful day is in our forecast before we're heating up all the way through Christmas... Read on for more details.\nWhat We're Tracking:\nWelcome to the weekend Crossroads! Coming our way today Friday is one last very nice day before we start warming up for almost the rest of 2025. Under beaming sunny skies Friday, high temps will heat to the upper 60s/low 70s, near 70 degrees. I recommend y'all get out there an enjoy it, because after Friday, it's just gonna be plain warm and a bit humid for the next several days... Warmth and humidity will return to the area as NE winds behind yesterday's cool front will shift back out of the SE by Friday afternoon. Onshore light winds for the next several nights/mornings will allow for patchy fog each morning from tonight through Christmas . Fog is expected to be light tonight/Saturday morning, but slightly denser the following next several mornings.\nHeaded into the weekend and Christmas week, temps will begin warming with onshore winds, but mainly warming due to high pressure on both the West and East Coast merging into one larger high system. This new high will park itself nearly directly over Texas before the midweek, and that will keep our skies mostly sunny and keep high temperatures in the low 80s through all Christmas week. Yes, we're looking for 81/82 degrees on Christmas Day , making this the third warmest Christmas on record ... But if the warm weather isn't for you, it is December after all, well our next cool front is in sight. The next front should pass the Crossroads either Dec. 28 or 29, cooling us back to the 60s and 70s.
