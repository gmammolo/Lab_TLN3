  "text": "Caleb Williams is at his best when temperatures are freezing\nMicah Huff\nThe winter cold in Chicago has already delivered some frigid days so far this month. The Bears have been known to be a team that opponents have to be prepared for to play in freezing temperatures come time for meaningful football. With the Bears looking primed for the playoffs and currently sitting with a high bid, they more than likely will at least have one cold January game. Caleb Williams last week displayed that the cold does not bother him; if anything, he is at his best in the cold.\nCaleb, in frigid temperatures against Cleveland, delivered his best performance of the season. Caleb was efficient, and he was accurate. Williams finished Week 15 with a 17-28 for 242 yards and 3 passing touchdowns performance.\nMike Pendleton with Bears Wire breaks down Caleb Williams and his newfound persona,' Iceman,' and how he backed it up with his great game against Cleveland:\n\"Even with the temperatures as chilly as they were, the Bears did not alter their game plan and were able to take it to the Browns with a 31-3 blowout win that saw them in control from start to finish.\nDespite the bitter cold conditions in the win, quarterback Caleb Williams did not appear bothered, throwing for 242 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions against the NFL's top passing defense. Following the game, Williams spoke about the conditions, which are similar to weekly practices, and how the adrenaline picks up on game day.\n\"We practice outside in this weather with no heaters, no benches, no anything, and so it's football weather, it's game day,\" Williams said. \"You've got a lot of adrenaline. We've got the benches, the heaters, the jackets, which everybody does a good job with, and then you go out there and you get going and you forget about those things. This is Chicago. You either got drafted here or you came here, so you're expecting that when it comes down to these times of the year. It's an advantage to us, I would say.\"\nThe Bears have had a dominant run game and a defense that can generate takeaways at a high level, two things that have been prominent in this team's rich history over the duration of this franchise. The Bears have been a team that has used their cold weather and stadium conditions to their advantage, as many teams that face Chicago in the crucial time of the season can not handle the cold. This season, not only do the Bears now have a good young quarterback, but they also do not have a quarterback who embraces the Chicago weather.\nSeattle beat the Rams last night, and that left the door open still for the Bears to have a slim chance to get the #1 seed. Even without the one seed, the Bears' best-case scenario could have them hosting two home games in the playoffs. If they can get the Caleb that played lights out in the freezing cold consistently, they have to like their chances.\nCaleb Williams, each game, is looking more and more like the guy to be the Bears' franchise quarterback. One of the biggest traits that entails how well you can play in the cold, so far, Caleb Williams has checked that box. Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears will be the most dangerous team to face come time for the NFL Playoffs.",
