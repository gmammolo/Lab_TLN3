  "text": "Warmer and breezy today as we look to stay mild and quiet through Christmas\nFriday December 19, 2025 Morning Forecast\nHASTINGS, Neb. (KSNB) - Good morning! After a chilly start this morning, temperatures will warm into the afternoon. Breezy winds will return today, however not quite what we saw yesterday. Dry conditions across northwestern Nebraska have lead to elevated fire concerns and Red Flag Warnings being issued, including North Platte.\nToday/Tonight: Patchy cloud cover from this morning is expected to clear out leading to plenty of sunshine for this afternoon. Temperatures warm back up today into the upper 40’s to low 50’s for much of eastern Nebraska. Highs in the mid 50’s are expected for central Nebraska, then western Nebraska will likely warm into the 60’s. Breezy winds return to around 10 to 20 mph with gusts around 25 to 35 mph. The strongest gusts will persist across northwestern portions of Nebraska where the relative humidity will drop into the 20’s. This has lead to elevated fire concerns for much of Northwestern Nebraska. Temperatures tonight stay mild in the upper 20’s to mid 30’s as mostly cloudy skies are expected.\nThis Weekend: Temperatures cool back down this weekend, but still fairly mild temperatures can be expected. Highs in the low to mid 40’s are likely Saturday, with upper 40’s to low 50’s Sunday. Winds stay breezy through the weekend into early next week. Partly cloudy skies Saturday turn to mostly cloudy Sunday. An isolated shower across northern Nebraska is possible Sunday, but much of the are should remain dry through the weekend.\nThe Week Of Christmas: Temperatures warm right back up into next week. Highs in the 50’s and 60’s are expected for Monday. We likely stay in the 50’s both Tuesday and Wednesday with light winds. By Christmas a warmer airmass is expected to move in bringing widespread 60’s. We stay in the 60’s into Friday before a slight cool down into the weekend. Precipitation chances will remain at a minimum through the next several days so any holiday travelers should have very nice travel conditions this holiday season.\nClick here to subscribe to our KSNB Local4 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KSNB.
