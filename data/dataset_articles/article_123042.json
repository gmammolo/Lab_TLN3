  "text": "by Al Neubert\nSnow and cold and more snow and cold continue to provide skiers and snowboarders with the best early season conditions in years. It’s been so good I can’t even remember when we last had such a great start throughout the Northeast. From New Jersey to Maine, consistent cold and natural snow has allowed ski area operators to open earlier than usual and with excellent snow surfaces. It’s been so good that in northern New England and New York there’s so much snow that you can ski most natural snow trails. The minor warm-up later this week will be followed by more cold and good snowmaking temperatures.\nFor the first time in maybe a decade or more, the East has better skiing and snowboarding than the West. Snowfall totals at western resorts are running at or less than half their long-term averages with some considerably below normal. By comparison, snowfall totals at northern Vermont ski areas have been well above average, led by Jay Peak which is closing in on 200 inches. Just south of Jay, Smuggler’s Notch and Stowe were over 100 inches and both Bolton Valley and Sugarbush were also close to the 100 inch mark.\nThe most recent snowstorm veered south and hugged the coast with the resorts closer to the metro areas picking up from five to seven inches. Montage, , Shawnee, Blue and Camelback, in Pennsylvania, got from four to seven inches while Mountain Creek, in northwestern New Jersey, picked up about six inches. The Catskill, Taconic and Berkshire based ski areas got from two to three inches and further north most ski areas got a dusting to an inch. Plattekill, in the western Catskills, has been in its own world with snowfall reaching 33 inches so far this season, over a foot more than Hunter, Windham and Belleayre. Plattekill, in Roxbury, opened for the season on Saturday and operates Friday through Sunday and daily during holiday periods.\nIt looks like all local and regional ski areas will be open for the upcoming holiday period. I spoke with Mike Taylor, owner of Holiday Mountain, near Monticello, this week and he told me that he’s hoping to have the entire trail network open by Friday. He said that only Hackledam, the ski area’s double black diamond run, might be the only trail that will not be ready by opening day but should be available shortly after Friday’s debut. Taylor told me that his team is working on the new chairlift that will be installed in May and open up formerly closed terrain in what was know as “The Bowl.”\nTaylor has been snakebit over the last two seasons with a fire destroying his pump house this offseason and then a fire severely damaging his brand new snow tubing lodge this past week. The lodge was nearing completion when an electrical issue in the roof started a fire that destroyed much of the structure’s rafters. Apparently, the wiring was connected to the snowmaking system for the tubing park and while it was running overnight something went very wrong. Taylor said the tubing park will be ready for the season but the lodge situation is still up in the air.\nI have been trying to get out as much as possible to take advantage of the snow zone. I skied at Hunter, in the northern Catskills last week on a perfect day. About 25 trails were open and that blossomed to 35 a few days later. Conditions were incredible and all but the Hunter West pod was open. You can now use Belt Parkway, Upper K27, Hellgate, Heuga, White Cloud and Upper East Side Drive from the summit.\nI skied at Windham, seven miles north of Hunter, from Friday through Sunday for a couple of hours each day in the late afternoons. Windham’s management got three of their high-speed lifts going with only the East Peak quad left to join the mix. Snow guns were trained on East Peak terrain so expect that pod to be ready for this weekend. Snow surfaces even late in the day were as good as you could want at any time. Powder and packed powder covered all the open terrain.\nFor winter sports enthusiasts, next year will be your “Super Bowl” with the winter Olympics being held in Cortina, Italy on February 6-22. The US Alpine team is shaping up to be one of the best ever, especially on the Women’s side. Mikaela Shiffrin is back from her injury last year and is ranked number one in the world, dominating the slalom and giant slalom events. Then there’s America’s super woman speed queen, Lindsey Vonn, who at 40 just won a downhill race in St. Moritz and finished second in the Super G at the same venue. The team is deep too with several other team members fighting for medals against the world’s competition.\nThink more snow for the holidays, and happy skiing and riding!
