  "text": "Evansville Could See One of the Warmest Christmases on Record\nIf you are dreaming of a white Christmas, much like Bing Crosby, we won't be getting one here in the Evansville area. However, it could be a Christmas for the record books in terms of temperatures.\nHere in the Evansville area, we saw some snow in November and early December already, and it's not even technically winter yet. Personally, I am not a fan of the cold or everything that goes along with it, but my hatred isn't enough to keep the cold temps and snowflakes away. That being said, if it's going to snow, I'd prefer it to snow on Christmas. I couldn't tell you the last time I experienced a white Christmas. Probably not since I was a child. Perhaps that's one reason why Christmas hasn't felt too Christmasy the past several years.\nIt should not come as a surprise to anyone that we will not be getting a white Christmas here in Evansville. According to the current forecast from Eyewitness News, a major warming trend kicks in next week, and we could see highs in the mid-60s on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. In fact, it could very well be one of the warmest Christmases on record for Evansville.\nThis Christmas Could Be One of the Warmest on Record for Evansville\nEyewitness News Meteorologist Cody Bailey took to social media to share the top five warmest Christmases on record for Evansville. The warmest actually occurred a few years ago in 2021, with a high of 71. Take a look at the post below for more.\nAs of this writing, Evansville can see a high of 61 degrees on Christmas Eve. Then, on Christmas Day, we will have a high of 65 degrees. That means that this Christmas could be the 4th warmest Christmas on record for Evansville.\nPretty wild, right? I'm not going to lie, if we aren't getting snow, I am not going to be upset about it being warm one bit.
