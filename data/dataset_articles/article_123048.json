  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Happy Fri-YAY!\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n- Breezy and cool this morning\n- Sunny and pleasant on Friday\n- Winter begins on Sunday\nFantastic Friday forecast!\nFriday's forecast is shaping up to be a spectacular day! Expect breezy conditions overnight as a weak cold front knocks our warm temps down to average. Typically, morning lows start near 50ºF, while afternoon highs peak near 70ºF. Breezy conditions may add an extra chill to the air Friday morning, but the afternoon will warm us up to very pleasant conditions!\nWarmer this weekend\nTemps will be warm again this weekend. Saturday starts with patchy fog transitioning to a somewhat muggy afternoon with highs in the low 80s. Isolated showers are in the forecast Sunday night and early Monday morning. This opportunity for rain will depend on how close a fizzling cold front actually gets to the Coastal Bend. Winter begin Sunday morning, but expect stretch of very warm weather to continue through Christmas Day.\nCORPUS CHRISTI FORECAST\nFri-YAY: Fantastic!\nTemperature: High 70ºF\nWinds: NE 5-10 mph\nFriday night: Clear skies, patchy fog overnight\nTemperature: Low 58ºF\nWinds: E 5-10 mph\nSaturday: AM fog, muggy and warm\nTemperature: High 81ºF\nWinds: SSE 10-15 mph\nHave an awesome weekend!",
