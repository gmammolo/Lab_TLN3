  "text": "By Amanda Brooks ,\n2 days ago Good running jackets will not only protect you from the elements but also help you shed extra heat and moisture. A great running jacket will protect you from the wind to make things more comfortable or keep you dry or through those cold winters help ensure you stay comfortable enough to do the miles.\nLack of breathability in a jacket might cause it to feel like a damp, swampy plastic bag. In contrast, running jackets with breathable materials, zippered vents, or mesh panels efficiently wick moisture away.\nRecently, when I asked what gear you really wanted to know about, I was surprised that what’s the best running jacket was the top question. Testing out gear is something I actually really enjoy. It’s an excuse to go for a run as part of my job, I mean really…how is that so hard?\nBut jackets meant, I was going to get to run in a variety of conditions . Bring on the snow, the rain, the wind, I shall fear thee not with my new gear.\nThe results below are jackets for a wide variety of situations that I would absolutely recommend. There were others tested that simply aren’t included here because they didn’t perform as well or better than the one’s I’ve listed.\nBest Running Jackets for 2025 Best Lululemon Running Jackets: Lululemon Down For it All Jacket, Mist Over Jacket , Another Mile Jacket Best Winter Running Jacket: Athleta Flurry Force Insulated PrimaLoft® Jacket II Best Very Cold Weather Running Jacket – Salomon Mountain Flex Hybrid Jacket Best Reflective Running Jacket – Oiselle Reflective Vim Jacket Best Water Repellant Running Jacket: On Running Weather Jacket Lightweight Fully Waterproof Running Jacket: Gorewear Rain Jacket Best Packable and Space Saving Jacket – Salomon Bonatti Waterproof Shell Jacket Best Cold Weather Vest – Oiselle Firecracker Vest 10 Best Running Jackets for Women What’s the best running jacket? The one that meets your needs for that day, but you’ll find many of these are versatile for a variety of conditions and temperatures.\nHonestly, I wanted to test out jackets for a variety of weather conditions. So you’ll find that some are better for maybe a spring run and some for a cold winter run, hopefully showing you what you need year-round to make running as comfortable as possible.\nBest Lululemon Running Jackets I feel like I’m often asked if they make good running gear, so I might as well answer this question first. Yes, I run in a lot of Lululemon shorts, tanks and even jackets because they do make gear that works.\nI used to think they were pricey, but really…nope.\nThey are right on par with other high quality brands that you’d want a long lasting running jacket from.\nAnother Mile Jacket – ($228) Primaloft means this is serious business for warmth, but remains a light weight jacket. BONUS points because the vest and hood zip out, which means you can make this jacket warmer by protecting your core or cooler…but again, this is a SERIOUS cold weather running jacket. Not a 32 degree day, you’ll overheat. Lululemon Down For it All Jacket – ($228) For days where you don’t quite need a sleeping bag, this is your go to cold weather jacket. It’s designed to move with you, has a great collar to actually keep your neck warm and a good phone pocket! Probably one of the most loved winter running jackets we hear about from runners all the time. Mist Over Jacket – ($128) It’s waterproof, wind resistant, lightweight and designed for runners with vents to help release heat. BIG winner for waterproof at this price point! Quick Take Fit\nI tend to size up in jackets if I want to layer much under them from Lulu because they are a bit more fitted. Durability\nA jacket you can wear for running and all over town still feeling stylish…unlike say the neon one I mention below. It’s gonna last like all their gear. Best Winter Running Jacket – Athleta Flurry Force Insulated PrimaLoft® Jacket II ($159) One of the things that we often find troubling with winter runs is that we start cold, begin sweating then are in a strange hot cold scenario.\nThis jacket felt so extremely light, but with the Primaloft through the front chest it’s designed to keep your core warm and when that happens your body will continue to work on warming your fingers and toes!!!\nLove that it’s also going to break the wind there, which helps with warmth.\nSince your core is warm, this has light sleeves and the back is actually lightly aerated. All of these means a good fit that keeps you warm, but not over heated.\nThere are two side pockets which you could shove a phone it, but I rarely like a phone in my running jacket. No matter how snug I feel like it bounces.\nDetails Color : 2 Size : XXS-XL Care : machine wash and dry Available from Athleta.com for $159 (currently on sale for $79) Quick Take Fit\nI wore a Medium in this and felt good that I could layer under and it was not too tight. Durability\nDefinitely a jacket you could wear with packs and not worry about rips. Not sure what you need for winter running gear layers?? I’ve got you covered with my guide on what to wear running at every temperature >>\nBest Very Cold Weather Running Jacket – Salomon Mountain Flex Hybrid Jacket ($200) The Salomon Mountain Flex Hybrid Jacket is designed to go the distance for cold-weather activities. It’s comfortable, warm, breathable, and moves with you – all of which are necessities for running in colder temps.\nThe Mountain Flex Hybrid Jacket (which is also available as a vest) promises a lightweight, insulated option with venting to keep you comfortable, even during a tough workout.\nOne of my favorite things is a versatile piece of running gear – I want to be able to use it for hikes, daily life, whatever, so that I can save space in my closet and when packing. So to test this I didn’t just take it out for some chilly morning runs, but I also wore it as an extra layer for my first fall in the Midwest.\nDetails Colors : 2 Size : XS-XL Care : Machine wash, tumble dry low Available from Salomon for $200 Quick Take Fit\nOur tester, Brittni, typically wears a small in most activewear, but opted for a medium to allow for layers underneath this – and it’s the perfect size for a piece of outerwear! Durability\nSuper durable and made with ClimateSync Technology so that it’ll keep you warm but also allow for moisture to escape as you move. Best Reflective Running Jacket – Oiselle Reflective Vim Jacket ($168) The Reflective Vim Jacket is lightweight and can be used in a range of weather conditions: warm but rainy runs, cool mornings/evenings, or winter runs with layers underneath.\nIt even folds up and can be worn as an armband if you get warm on a run and need to take it off. There is also a stowable hood that folds up.\nDetails Color : 3 Size : XS-3X Care : machine wash, tumble dry Available from Oiselle.com for $168 Quick Take Fit\nThe fit of this jacket is true to size, and fits comfortably. It’s big enough to wear with a couple of layers underneath if needed and long enough to cover your full torso. Durability\nThick quality material, no fears of it ripping or losing it’s reflection! Can be machine washed, which is not the case for a lot of these. Best Water Repellant Running Jacket: On Running Weather Jacket ($240) Technically this jacket is only water repellent and their Ultra Jacket (which I have tested as well) is legit going to keep you dry. But this is still my top pick for a jacket when drizzly or snowing.\nHands down this jacket is worth every single penny if you find yourself running in through a wide variety of temps throughout the year. I have worn mine a crazy amount for years and it’s still in good shape.\nSuper lightwight, easy to layer under it. The hood can stay up…but easier to get it to stay up if I happen to have on a beanie or something.\nI used it over my winter fleece on a day where snow was falling and on a warm rainy trail run in Sedona . In both cases I was amazed to finish up finding that truly I was still dry (I mean minus my normal sweat session).\nMore importantly in the warm weather instance was that this jacket is light and since it wasn’t hot enough to want to be wet, it felt like the perfect weight.\nDetails Color : 3 Size : XS-XL Care : machine wash cold, tumble dry Available from on.com for $240 Quick Take Fit\nI went with a small. It’s a good fit with plenty of movement in arms and shoulders even when I had on a couple layers underneath. Doesn’t look baggy when wearing just a short sleeve shirt. I did pull the hood up and actually had it stay in place while running. Durability\nThis has been tossed in an out of bags and worn with a pack, I feel pretty confident it’s got a very long life. **They do also have the On Weather Insulated Jacket . I’ve also tested this out alongside their Core jacket which is listed for cold weather too. So here’s my take…\n1. I really like On apparel. It works. It fits. It lasts.\n2. But if I were buying a serious winter running jacket, it wouldn’t be the On Weather Insulated . It’s mostly adding some warm through the front panels and a nice fleece collar, which is great for some chilly days, but when it’s serious cold this wouldn’t do anything for me. It is a slimmer fit, so know that when buying if you want to layer under it.\n3. The Core Jacket is just a slightly thicker version of the Weather Jacket. So I personally would go for that more versatile thin jacket and just layer. BUT this will do more for wind blocking.\nLightweight Fully Waterproof Running Jacket: Gorewear Rain Jacket ($270) When you need to get your run done and the rain just won’t stop, this is your jacket. Active technology that helps to ensure it’s breathable, windproof and doesn’t just keep off a little rain, but is truly waterproof for most rains.\nHonestly, Gorewear has really surprised me this year. I didn’t know that much about them, but having tested a variety of pieces it’s top notch performance.\nThis jacket is supremely light for being fully waterproof. (sorry I’ll get a photo of me added shortly…why are rain photos so hard?!) So that’s important to note when choosing what temperature you’ll be wearing it in. Checkout my full guide on what to wear running at every temperature, to prevent overdressing!\nDetails Color : 10 Size : XXS-XL Care : Machine wash, tumble dry Available from Gorewear.com for $270 Quick Take Fit\nNot super fitted, but not loose. Comes in XXS to XXL so if you want for winter, I would size up to layer under. Durability\nSuper durable, David has worn in mountain biking all over the place. Best Packable and Space Saving Jacket – Salomon Bonatti Waterproof Shell Jacket ($180) This jacket is one of the lightest weight waterproof options I’ve tested. In a heavy downpour, I came home sweaty, but not wet. It felt comfortable in 40 degree chilly rain.\nIt also packs easily into the front pocket for travel or trail days where you’re taking layers on and off.\nDetails Colors : 4 Size : XS-XL Care : Machine wash delicate, tumble dry Available from Salomon.com for $180 Quick Take Fit\nThe loose fit makes it comfortable to layer as needed based on temps. Durability\nHighly durable Best Cold Weather Vest – Oiselle Firecracker Vest ($168) Ok so…it’s not a jacket, but Coach Stacey and Coach Kaitlyn have very much proved to me that some of you need a less is more approach. Running in a vest means that your organs are warm and protected, which then allows the body to send more bloodflow to your arms, feet, hands, etc.\nSo if you’re like I’m tired of overheating, but you don’t want to be cold, well a vest could be the answer!\nThis one has a lot of pockets PLUS reflective designs on the back to keep you safe.\nDetails Color : 3 Size : XS-XL Care : Machine wash delicate, tumble dry Available from Oiselle.com for $168 Quick Take Fit\nFull zip with an internal waist bungee and thumb holes Durability\nHighly durable Should You Wear a Jacket While Running? Running layers are always useful, but more so when you are dealing with the elements. A running jacket is a great tool to ensure that you don’t use the weather as an excuse to skip your run.\nHonestly, I probably didn’t think much about them for the first 10 years of running.\nNow they’re my go to piece for Fall and winter. I LOVE that they block the wind, which makes me feel a million times better in the cold.\nWhat’s the Difference Between Waterproof, Water resistant, and Windproof Jackets? Waterproof refers to a fabric’s resistance to water penetration. It creates a barrier between you and the elements.\nWater resistant resists the penetration of water at low levels, which is sufficient for mild drizzle or light rain, but water will penetrate the fabric if pressure is applied, such as by a backpack strap.\nWindproof is the fabric’s resistance to air penetration. It can be done by the way the fabric is made or by covering it with a membrane or layer that doesn’t let wind through.\nA few of the many running jackets I’ve tested and kept in my rotation (recommended below). Yes, everything here was reviewed as a women’s running jacket because that’s what I wear.\nBut have no fear, these are also the best men’s running jackets I feel very confident in saying as the overall features and technology are the same.\nMore questions on running jackets or other gear? Let me know so I can keep reviewing exactly what you need!\nOther ways to connect with Amanda\nInstagram Daily Fun: RunToTheFinish\nFacebook Community Chatter: RunToTheFinish\nSign Up to Receive a Weekly Newsletter with Top Running Tips and Laughs\nThe post 10 Best Running Jackets for Women (All Weather Options) appeared first on RunToTheFinish .",
