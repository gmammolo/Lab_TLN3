  "text": "Over the past few weeks, it has been a glorious stretch of skiing for the Northeast thanks to cold temperatures and a decent amount of natural snowfall. Unfortunately, this is the East, and all good things have to come to an end.\nA rainstorm is making its way through the region today, leading to some temporary ski resort closures. For those who enjoy the softer snow, the bad news is that cold weather returns tonight, resulting in an overnight freeze.\nHowever, things are looking good for the Northeast following today’s wannabe monsoon. Here are a few reasons why the region’s ski forecast still looks promising.\nMore Water for Snowmaking\nSome ski resorts have limited capacity in their snowmaking ponds, so rain and melted snow can refill them. Snowmakers can refresh the trails they previously made snow on, and then expand their trail count. Add that with cold temperatures, and it suddenly looks promising. Which leads us to…\nLong-Range Forecast Looks Cold\nMost ski resorts in the Northeast rely on snowmaking to expand their open terrain. After this deluge, ski resorts will be able to make snow. It looks like the window will last long past Christmas, with chances for snow as well.\nUltimately, despite this setback, Northeast ski resorts are still in solid shape for Christmas week. May want to sharpen those edges, though, if you go this weekend.\nImage/Video Credits: Loon Mountain Resort, Sugarloaf",
