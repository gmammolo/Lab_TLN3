  "text": "First Alert Forecast: Gusty weekend before temperatures rise through Christmas\nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - Temperatures have dropped and wind gusts remain through the rest of the day today. Highs today will only be in the 20s, with wind gusts as high as 35mph. This means our wind chills will stay between the single digits and teens throughout the day. We will warm up for the start of the weekend, with highs in the 40s tomorrow before a slight drop for Sunday.\nWe are still trending well above average around Christmas and that means a very mild Christmas is in store next week. Highs for both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day will be in the 50s with Christmas Day reaching near 60 degrees. Our record warmest Christmas is 64 set back in 1982, depending on how much warmer we trend throughout next week, we could be near the record. A few late evening rain showers Wednesday night into Thursday could mean a wet start to the holiday, but dry conditions are expected towards the end of the day.\nCopyright 2025 WPTA.
