MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START GETTING TO THE ROADS, MAYBE TAKING A PLANE, TRAVELING, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT GOOD STUFF. WE ARE, WHAT, 21, 27 DEGREES RIGHT NOW? REAL COLD RIGHT NOW, ADAM. YEAH, QUITE A CHANGE IN 24 HOURS. WE WERE IN THE MID 50S. YESTERDAY, BASICALLY AT NOONTIME. CHOPPED IN HALF. NO PROBLEM. YEAH, ABOUT 30 DEGREE DROP HERE OVERNIGHT. BUT YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY IT’S JUST COLD TODAY. IT’S ALSO WINDY OUT THERE. SO IT MAKES IT FEEL MUCH COLDER. THAT’S GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY TODAY. BEFORE WE GET INTO A BIT BIT OF A BETTER PATTERN AS WE GO INTO THE WEEKEND. SO YOU SEE THE FLAG WAVING THERE IN THE WIND. WE’VE HAD 30 MILE AN HOUR GUSTS AT TIMES THIS AFTERNOON. WE’LL KEEP THAT GOING THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE STARTS TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT LATER ON THIS EVENING. THE WIND DOES MAKE THE OHIO RIVER LOOK LIKE IT’S GOING BACKWARDS, THOUGH. AT LEAST THAT SURFACE LAYER. OBVIOUSLY IT’S STILL FLOWING TO THE MISSISSIPPI, BUT WE DO HAVE A SPLIT WEEKEND FORECAST HERE FOR THIS WEEKEND, SATURDAY, SUNDAY, AND THEN WE’RE WATCHING THAT HOLIDAY FORECAST CLOSELY. IF YOU DO HAVE TO TRAVEL, YOU MAY RUN INTO A FEW IMPACTS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU’RE GOING. BUT OVERALL NOT TOO BAD HERE IN THE FORECAST. SO IT’S ALL DRY RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE A FEW SNOW FLURRIES THIS MORNING THAT LEFT A DUSTING OUT ON SOME ROOFS, SOME GRASSY AREAS. YOUR VEHICLES. THIS IS JUST A LOT OF GROUND CLUTTER SHOWING HERE FROM INDIANAPOLIS BACK INTO PARTS OF THE COLUMBUS CINCINNATI AREA. MOST OF THAT SNOW OUT NOW OUT TOWARDS PITTSBURGH UP INTO CLEVELAND. KIND OF THE GREAT LAKES REGION. BUT TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW WE’RE STUCK IN THE 20S. AS STEVEN MENTIONED, WE’RE SITTING IN THE UPPER 20S RIGHT NOW TO MID 20S WITH 27, IN CINCINNATI TO HAMILTON, LOVELAND, BATAVIA, 29 THERE IN BROOKSVILLE, BROOKSVILLE, I SHOULD SAY 25 OUT IN THE BATESVILLE OLDENBURG AREA. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADD IN THESE WINDS OUT THERE, CURRENT GUSTS GETTING UP TO 40 HERE IN CINCINNATI, 38 BLANCHESTER, 39 HILLSBORO, EVEN SOME MID 30S THROUGH NORTHERN KENTUCKY AND SOUTHEAST INDIANA. SO ONCE YOU ADD IN THAT WIND CHILL FACTOR OUT THERE, IF YOU’RE OUTSIDE, IT’S FEELING MORE LIKE THE MID TEENS. AND BASICALLY THESE AREN’T GOING TO CHANGE MUCH THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE HIGHS TODAY REALLY ONLY MAKING IT INTO THESE UPPER 20S, MAYBE INTO THE 30 DEGREE MARK FOR A FEW COMMUNITIES. SO IF YOU’RE OUT DOING SOME LAST MINUTE HOLIDAY SHOPPING, EXPECT THE COLD TEMPERATURES TO LAST. IF YOU’RE HOPING TO GET OUT TO SOME HOLIDAY LIGHTS, MAYBE MAKE IT THOSE DRIVE THROUGH LIGHT DISPLAYS THAT ARE OUT THERE BECAUSE TEMPERATURES STAY IN THE 20S FOR TONIGHT INTO LATE TONIGHT WITH FEELING LIKE WE’RE IN THE LOWER TEENS, POTENTIALLY EVEN NEAR THE SINGLE DIGITS AS WE HEAD INTO LATE TONIGHT. NOW, AS I MENTIONED, THOSE WINDS DO START TO BACK OFF TONIGHT, BUT NONETHELESS A VERY COLD FRIDAY NIGHT OUT THERE. BY THIS WEEKEND THOUGH, WE FLIP IT BACK AROUND. WE’RE BACK NEAR 50 DEGREES ON SATURDAY. A GREAT DAY HERE WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. DOES COOL DOWN A BIT ON SUNDAY. WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A WEAK FRONT. PASSING DOESN’T BRING ANY PRECIPITATION WITH IT, BUT IT DOES KNOCK US BACK DOWN INTO THE UPPER 30S. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE THERE IN THE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AS WELL. SO IF YOU DO HAVE TRAVEL PLANS THIS WEEKEND, NOT LOOKING TOO BAD. NOW IF YOU’RE THINKING OF MAYBE SOME WARMER PLACES. AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER ON. TOP DESTINATIONS MIAMI, MUCH OF FLORIDA. WELL, MIAMI GAME WITH THE BENGALS AGAINST THE DOLPHINS OUT THERE ALMOST IN MARLINS 1:00 PM KICKOFF. IF YOU’RE HEADING DOWN TO MIAMI, LOOK AT THAT UPPER 70S IN THE FORECAST. IF YOU’RE STUCK HERE IN CINCINNATI WATCHING THE GAME UNFORTUNATELY WILL BE IN THE MID 30S THERE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SO A COLD, CHILLY GAME DAY TO WATCH INSIDE INDOORS HERE AROUND CINCINNATI. UNLESS YOU’RE GOING DOWN TO FLORIDA. AND THEN AS WE GO INTO NEXT WEEK WITH THE HOLIDAYS APPROACHING, WE WILL BE DEALING WITH SOME SPOTTY IMPACTS HERE AND THERE WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS ON THE WAY. BUT TEMPERATURES OVERALL STAYING PRET\nUpdated: 12:30 PM EST Dec 19, 2025\nEditorial Standards\nAdvertisement\nArctic feel today before a better weekend in Cincinnati\nWind chills stay in the teens today, but milder air returns for this weekend with sunshine\nUpdated: 12:30 PM EST Dec 19, 2025\nEditorial Standards\nWind chills stay in the teens today, but milder air returns for this weekend with sunshine\nWind chills stay in the teens today, but milder air returns for this weekend with sunshine\nAdvertisement",
