  "text": "Sunny skies – UK breaks sunshine records in 2025 Met Office figures show\nThe UK has seen more sunshine hours than average this year, but is there a long-term trend towards it getting sunnier?\nThe skies have been particularly sunny this year, with the UK recording 1,622 hours of sunshine up until 15th December. That makes it the sunniest year since records began in 1910, provisional statistics from the Met Office show.\nAnd there is a general trend of it becoming sunnier, the most recent UK State of the Climate Report states, which spells good news for energy bills.\nSunshine everywhere\nWith just a few weeks to go until the end of 2025, England has logged its sunniest year on record, breaking the previous record set in 2003. Scotland has recorded its second sunniest year and Wales its sixth. Northern Ireland has seen above average sunshine, but not enough to break into the top ten sunniest years on record, although that could change by the end of the year.\nMet Office Senior Scientist Mike Kendon said: “The record-breaking sunshine across the UK this year was driven by the frequent influence of high pressure that reduced cloud cover and brought sunny skies for many.”\nThe year began with plenty of sunshine, but February's lower-than-usual sunshine levels resulted in a duller meteorological winter than normal. Spring, however, turned out to be the sunniest on record, only surpassed by the summer sunshine of 1911, 1976, and 1995. Summer also enjoyed more sunshine than usual, but autumn – particularly October – experienced a dip in sunshine levels.\nKendon added: “Spring was exceptional, and many will remember the long spells of days with largely unbroken sunshine. It began with the third-sunniest March on record, followed by a record-breaking sunniest April and then the second-sunniest May. All three months of the summer also saw above-average sunshine hours and while sunny periods are not unusual at this time of year, the duration and consistency of high-pressure systems made 2025 notably sunnier than average.\"\nAnd sunnier days go hand in hand with warmer temperatures and provisional statistics show it’s been another extremely warm year in the UK, with overall below average rainfall.\nIs it getting sunnier?\nThe UK has generally been getting sunnier since the 1980s according to the most recent UK State of the Climate Report, but it can’t say for sure why this is. It could be down to natural variability, as shown over the last two years, where 2024 was the dullest year since 1998, and 2025 the UK’s sunniest year on record. The reduced use of aerosols could be a factor.\nAlthough climate projections currently show no conclusive evidence of a future trend in sunshine amounts due to climate change, this extra sunshine has benefits, especially in the energy sector where solar power has provided over 6% of Britain’s annual energy needs so far this year, an almost 50% increase on recent years.\nBetween April to August, solar power provided more than 10% of Great Britain’s energy needs. A new record for total output from solar energy was made on 8th July, when over 14GW of electricity was generated, enough to deliver over 40% of Britain’s electricity needs at the time.\nEnergy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Solar is one of the cheapest forms of power – getting us off fossil fuels and delivering energy security so we can get bills down for good. The sunniest year on record highlights the huge opportunity we have to make the most of this clean energy source and keep installing more solar panels on schools, hospitals and homes. As we move into 2026, we will scale up the solar power we need to shield households from volatile fossil fuel markets and tackle the climate crisis.”\nNews source\nMet Office: 2025 is already the UK’s sunniest year on record",
