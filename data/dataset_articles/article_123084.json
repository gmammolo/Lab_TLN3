  "text": "Sunshine brings warm afternoons for the weekend\nPANAMA CITY, Fla. (WJHG/WECP) - Good Friday afternoon everyone! A cold front passed through last night helping to sweep away yesterday’s rain and open our skies to sunshine. However, it comes with a brief cooldown before we warm up into the weekend.\nTODAY: Sunny skies with a light northerly wind and highs only reaching the low to mid 60s from inland to the coast.\nTHIS EVENING & TONIGHT: Dress warmly! We’ll cool off quickly into the 50s by sunset and late evening plans will flirt with the 40s. Overnight lows reach the upper 30s on the coast to low 30s inland where a light freeze or frost is possible by Saturday morning.\nTHIS WEEKEND: After a chilly start Saturday morning in the 30s, plenty of sunshine returns to warm us back up to seasonal highs in the upper 60s.\nSunday morning will still be chilly but not quite as freezing cold. Lows reach the upper 30s inland to low 40s on the coast. Expect temperatures to warm quickly into the 60s by mid-morning and 70s by lunch. Highs top out in the low 70s under mostly sunny skies. A few clouds may enter some of our western counties by the afternoon.\nNEXT WEEK: A dry cold front passes through Sunday night into Monday dropping temperatures briefly into the upper 60s for Monday afternoon. Then, a wonderful stretch of sunshine and pleasant temperatures head our way right into Christmas. Mornings largely start out in the chilly 40s inland to low 50s on the coast. But afternoons warm up to the low 70s, possibly mid 70s, for the rest of the week.\nCHRISTMAS EVE: Quiet conditions are expected for Santa’s arrival and for any Christmas eve services or festivities. Skies look mainly clear and temperatures will turn cool falling through the 60s during the early evening to somewhat chilly 50s for any late evening plans.\nCHRISTMAS DAY: Mainly sunny skies are expected and after a cool morning opening presents mainly in the 50s, we’ll warm up to the low to mid 70s in the afternoon. Perfect for heading outdoors to play with new toys!\nTo stay up to date on all the latest news as it develops, follow WJHG on Facebook, Instagram and X (Twitter).\nHave a news tip or see an error that needs correction?
