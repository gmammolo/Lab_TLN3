  "text": "Are you hoping for snow and a white Christmas in Vancouver? Well, like Lloyd Christmas said in Dumb and Dumber, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is telling us there’s a chance.\nAfter several days of overnight lows hovering around 5˚C, on Dec. 23 and Dec. 24, the forecast is showing a pretty significant drop in temperature by about 4˚C.\nIt also comes with a chance of flurries (or rain). Before we get to Christmas, though, there’s a lot of interesting weather in store for Vancouver leading up to it.\nOver the next 24 hours, there’s a risk of a thunderstorm and the chance for some more windy conditions. Many BC Hydro customers faced power outages earlier this week, and many of those outages have been restored by BC Hydro’s maintenance workers.\nAfter the next 24 hours, there’s much more rain in the forecast, until Dec. 23, when overnight there’s a chance of rain or flurries. That pattern continues into Christmas Eve. And we don’t yet know what the deal will be for Christmas Day, aside from more showers in the daytime.\nWinds could rise to speeds of 40 km/h both today and tomorrow.\nRecent conversations that Daily Hive has had with ECCC revealed that the region was experiencing well-below seasonal temperatures for this time of year, which has contributed to some of the damaging wet weather we’ve been seeing. In fact, on Dec. 15, several warm weather records were broken across the province.\nWe spoke to ECCC back in October, and what they told us about snow in Vancouver has panned out. We were told that if Vancouver were to see snow this year, it wouldn’t be until December at the earliest.\nOne thing is for sure: if Vancouver does get a white Christmas, it will be nothing short of a Christmas miracle.\nAre you hoping for snow this Christmas in Vancouver?",
