  "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - Next 24 Hours: Behind the cold front, much colder air has settled in. We are at least enjoying lots of sunshine today. This evening will be cool with temperatures in the upper 30s and lower 40s by 6 to 7 p.m. Tonight will be clear and cold with temperatures falling into the 30s and upper 20s. A light freeze is possible in some spots by Saturday morning.\nFuture Radar (WBRC) First Alert Rain Coverage (WBRC) This Weekend: Saturday starts cold with temperatures near or slightly below freezing. Sunshine will help temperatures rebound quickly, and highs are expected to climb into the low 60s during the afternoon with dry conditions. Clouds increase late Saturday night ahead of a weak cold front, and widely scattered showers (40% chance) may move in early Sunday through the early evening hours. We kept a slight rain chance Monday for a few lingering showers (a low 10-20% chance), but most of the weekend and start to next week looks settled.\nChristmas Outlook (WBRC) Christmas Outlook: Early next week stays mild with partly to mostly cloudy skies. Only an isolated shower is possible Monday or Tuesday, with highs in the mid 60s. The good news is we look dry heading into the holidays with quite the warmup. For Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, expect a mix of sun and clouds with highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. Some locations could reach the mid 70s on Christmas Day.\nBe sure to check the WBRC First Alert Weather app for the latest.
