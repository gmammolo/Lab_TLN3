  "text": "Dodge City, KS – Residents across southwest Kansas can expect an unusually warm and dry Christmas week, with temperatures climbing well above normal and record highs potentially in reach, according to the National Weather Service.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Dodge City, mild and dry weather is forecast through at least Thursday, December 26, with rain chances near 0% across the region. Forecast models show little to no precipitation across much of the central Plains, setting the stage for a dry holiday period.\nHigh temperatures are expected to reach the low to mid-70s across southwest Kansas on both Christmas Eve (Wednesday) and Christmas Day (Thursday) — levels more typical of early fall than late December.\nForecasters say this warmth could put Christmas Day records at risk. In Dodge City, the record high for Christmas Day is 74 degrees, set in 1950. Current projections suggest that record could be tied or broken, depending on cloud cover and daytime mixing.\nWhile the Christmas Eve record high of 86 degrees, set in 1955, is not expected to be challenged, meteorologists note that such records are exceptionally strong and rarely broken.\nThe extended warmth is being driven by a persistent upper-level pattern keeping storm systems well north and west of Kansas, allowing dry air and warmer temperatures to dominate the central Plains.\nWith dry conditions persisting, officials remind residents that fire danger may increase, especially during the afternoon hours when winds pick up and humidity drops.\nThose with holiday travel plans should find generally favorable driving conditions, though gusty winds may develop at times.\nResidents are encouraged to monitor local forecasts for updates as Christmas approaches.",
