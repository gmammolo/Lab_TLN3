  "text": "Champaign, IL – Residents across Central Illinois, including Champaign and surrounding communities, should prepare for a rollercoaster week of temperatures, with cold nights, fluctuating daytime highs, and a potentially record-warm Christmas Day, according to the National Weather Service.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, temperatures will rebound into the 40s on Saturday, then dip back into the 30s on Sunday before warming steadily heading into next week. By Christmas Day (Thursday), highs across Champaign and much of Central Illinois could reach the mid to upper 60s, levels that may challenge or exceed historical records.\nForecast data shows overnight lows remaining in the 20s through the weekend, meaning chilly mornings despite afternoon improvements. Saturday is expected to be partly cloudy and breezy, with highs ranging from 41 to 49 degrees, followed by mostly sunny skies Sunday with highs between 34 and 40 degrees.\nConditions turn milder starting Monday, with highs in the low to mid-40s, climbing into the 50s Tuesday and upper 50s to low 60s Wednesday. On Christmas Day, Champaign-area highs are forecast between 63 and 69 degrees, far above late-December averages.\nForecasters note that most of Central Illinois should remain dry through Christmas, with no significant precipitation expected. The dry stretch will help holiday travel but could also result in elevated fire danger on warmer, breezier afternoons.\nResidents should be prepared for large daily temperature swings, dressing in layers and keeping an eye on updated forecasts as Christmas approaches. While the warmth may feel welcome, officials remind the public that sudden changes are typical during transitional winter patterns.",
