  "text": "Another Wednesday (Dec. 10) and it was another snow day for Remsen and many area schools. I would say it was a good call because it never stopped snowing all day. I did not go far on the road and was very happy to stay home. When schools are closed in the area, our exercise group is also cancelled.\nOn Monday, Dec. 8, our Fortnightly ladies met at the home of Artie Finn for soup and crackers, games and cookies. We also brought canned goods for area food pantries instead of our usual gift exchange. It was a fun day of chatting and camaraderie. Thank you goes to Artie for hosting and all the other soup makers and cookie bakers. A delicious lunch was enjoyed by all.",
