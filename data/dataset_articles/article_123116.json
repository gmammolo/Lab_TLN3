  "text": "A new warming shelter comes to Pocatello ahead of the winter season.\nValley Mission has partnered with the Housing Alliance and Community Partnership to bring the shelter to the community.\nThe warming shelter will be open when night time temperatures are predicted to be 25 degrees or colder and when volunteers are available.\nWhen the shelter is operating, it will be open open from 7pm to 7am with intakes from 7pm to 10pm.\nIt houses 42 beds for men and women, hot beverages, snacks, and hot food such as ramen noodles.\nThe shelter accommodates individuals who are ages 18 and up.\nValley Mission Director Karl Pettit says this gives people another place to go as we approach the winter season.\n\"When it's normally at Idaho winter, it's cold. And so for folks who can't get into the shelter, if they're full or for a variety of reasons, they need a place to go. So, with Jared's help and his team, we were able to acquire this building here 805 North Main, to be able to get ready for those cold nights. It's a definitely a community partnership, to say the least.\"\nFor more information on volunteer opportunities for the shelter can find it here. All volunteers must complete training before being scheduled as a volunteer.",
