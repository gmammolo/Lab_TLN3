  "text": "Mission readiness maintained in style…Into a brisk wind off the northern Pacific, a brief respite from multiple atmospheric rivers and wintry conditions, Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Health Promotion – ably assisted by command Junior Enlisted Association volunteers - held their final monthly 5K for 2025 with the Ugly Sweater run/walk for a host of hardy participants.\nFirst place females went to Lt. Meagan Rawers, with Lt. Bueniel Kim placing second and Hospitalman Alice Kate Williams taking third. Top male finished was Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Theodore Hospodar, with Hospitalman Ethon Hernandez in second and Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Corey Bryan in third place.\nThe monthly run/walk events, coordinated by Trish Skinner, NHB’s Health Promotion and Wellness Center department head, began in 2024, with 16 events held that year, over 300 participants totaling 958 miles. There were 14 5K for 2025, with 237 participants registering 735 miles. Virtual runs were also offered for 2025, which drew 348 registrants, with 271 completing their chosen 5K [and more] for a total of 1,704 miles. One virtual runner also completed 69 miles for one of Health Promotion and Wellness Center’s highly sought finisher medals.
