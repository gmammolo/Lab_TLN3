  "text": "Austin–San Antonio, TX – Central Texas residents can expect a quiet but unusually warm stretch of weather heading into Christmas, with dry conditions and temperatures climbing well above seasonal averages.\nAccording to the National Weather Service Austin–San Antonio, tonight will be mostly clear and seasonably cool across the region. Low temperatures are expected to range from the upper 40s to lower 50s, with patchy fog and low clouds developing late, especially over the Coastal Prairies. South winds of 5–15 mph may gust up to 20 mph at times.\nThe calm pattern gives way to a notably warm and dry Christmas week. Forecast data shows daytime highs steadily climbing into the upper 70s and low 80s across much of Central Texas, including Austin, San Antonio, New Braunfels, San Marcos, Georgetown, and surrounding Hill Country communities. Some locations may approach record high temperatures by midweek.\nSan Antonio is forecast to see highs near 80 degrees multiple days this week, while Austin and nearby cities are expected to reach the upper 70s. Overnight lows will also trend warmer than normal, staying mainly in the upper 50s to low 60s.\nDespite the warmth, no significant rain chances are expected through Christmas, which is good news for holiday travel, outdoor gatherings, and events across the I-35 corridor. The lack of rainfall, however, may continue to contribute to dry ground conditions in parts of the region.\nDrivers should remain alert for early morning fog, particularly in low-lying and coastal-adjacent areas, which could briefly reduce visibility during overnight and early commute hours.\nResidents are encouraged to stay hydrated during outdoor activities and remain aware that warmer temperatures can still pose risks during extended exposure, even in December.",
