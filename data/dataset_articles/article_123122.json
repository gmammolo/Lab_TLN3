  "text": "Quincy, Illinois Could Have Its Warmest Christmas Ever\nDo you dream of a white Christmas? If you live anywhere near Quincy, Illinois, you can forget about that possibility as there's now a trend that shows it could be the warmest Christmas in history.\nI remember sharing a couple of weeks ago that a warm-up was coming to the Quincy, Illinois area in the middle of December. The one thing I didn't see coming was what Christmas was going to look like. Based on the amount of snowfall we received in late November and early December, I thought it was a slam dunk that we'd still have snow on the ground for December 25. Boy, was I wrong.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in St. Louis, Missouri, the warmest Christmas Day in Quincy, Illinois history was 66 degrees Fahrenheit back in 2019. As of the date of this writing, the furthest out official NWS forecast shows a high of 57 degrees in Quincy for Tuesday, December 23. If you look at The Weather Channel who does have a forecast for Quincy for all of next week, you'll see they're currently forecasting a high of 65. That's right on the edge of the all-time record for Christmas in Quincy.\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction Center shows that even more warmer than normal temperatures are coming. This is their outlook for the next 8 to 14 days which shows our part of America can expect way above average temperatures.\nWill Quincy break the all-time heat record for Christmas? It's entirely possible. Stay tuned and get those short-sleeve shirts and tank tops ready.\nStep Inside the World’s Largest Arcade—Right in Illinois\nGallery Credit: Justin Wong via YouTube",
