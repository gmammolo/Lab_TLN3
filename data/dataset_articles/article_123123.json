  "text": "BRAINERD — After two less-than-stellar winters, area skiers are rejoicing in this year’s earlier arrival of snow.\nMembers of Brainerd’s Nordic Ski Club have been busy for weeks grooming trails after plenty of fluffy snowfall since Thanksgiving. It’s rare, members said, to have two winters in a row with low snowfall.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut this year, the five trails maintained by the Nordic Ski Club are groomed and ready to welcome skiers.\n“This is phenomenal,” trail groomer Rick Hines said on Monday, Dec. 15. “We’re way ahead of schedule. Last year you couldn’t buy snow.”\nThe club manages trails at the Northland Arboretum, Forestview Middle Schools, French Rapids, Wolf Lake and Larson Lake. The trails are grant-in-aid trails, which means state funding pays for some of the grooming costs, while the club picks up the rest of the tab through membership fees, ski passes and licensing and its annual lumberjack race.\n“Of the grant-in-aid trails in outstate Minnesota, we’ve been noted to be one of the most used trail systems here at the Arboretum,” said club board member Mary Claire Ryan. “The only other ones that compare with us have been the ones up on the North Shore.”\nWhile the trails are widely used by both classic and skate skiers, club members want to remind the community they are not for walking and snowshoeing. Especially on warm winter days, when more walkers are apt to be out and about, the tracks can damage the carefully groomed trails. The base snow is softest on the warm days, club member and trail groomer Bryan Pike explained, meaning footprints and snowshoes will dig down and leave large divots.\n“It’s like the proper etiquette on a golf course — replace your divots, etc.,” Pike said, noting walkers make their own divots with boots, and then when temperatures get lower again, a ridge of snow freezes next to those imprints.\n“And then if you want to skate ski,” Pike added, “you’re skiing over those humps and bumps.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd fixing those bumps is not a quick process.\nIt takes hours of multiple passes with a widetrack snowmobile pulling the proper equipment to get the trails back to ideal skiing conditions.\nTrail groomers work all hours of the day, too, when snowfall happens, as it’s easier to start grooming partway through a large snow event rather than wait until several inches have fallen.\nDaily grooming reports are available for Brainerd Nordic Ski Club members. More information about the club and how to join is available at\nbrainerdnorcskiclub.com\n.\nThe club will host its annual Lumberjack Jaunt on Jan. 24 in Baxter. Details can be found online.",
