  "text": "A weather system blowing through the Midwest late Wednesday night into Thursday (Dec. 16-17, 2025), triggered high wind warnings, the closure of Interstate 29 from Canada to South Dakota because of blizzard conditions and a temporary suspension on the movement of oversize loads on state roadways.\nAberdeen National Weather Service Meteorologist Travis Tarver said the gusty wind will continue the rest of the day.\nTarver said the National Weather Service has clocked dozens of wind gusts at more than 80 mph.\nThe forecast is quite a bit different for Friday, with an expected high of 47°F, mainly cloudy skies and southeast winds at 10 to 15 mph.\nTo see a map of wind gusts and other weather reports, go to the National Weather Service website.",
