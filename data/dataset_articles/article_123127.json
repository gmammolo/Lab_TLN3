  "text": "Expect A Warming Trend Into Christmas\nMilder Weekend, Much Warmer Next Week\nTOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - The weekend will be milder than it has been. It gets warmer next week, as some places could hit about 70°F in the afternoons by midweek. If you were hoping for a white Christmas, it won’t happen.\nKeyes To The Forecast:\n- Fire danger will be very high this afternoon. Strong winds and dry air mean fires can start and spread easily. Conditions should ease tonight as winds die down and humidity rises.\n- A small spark can quickly become a large fire. Homes, fields and brush are at greater risk, and smoke could lower air quality. Rapid fire spread could force quick evacuations. Do not burn yard debris or use fireworks; avoid operating equipment that can create sparks (mowers, chainsaws) in dry areas; don’t park on dry grass; secure grills and hot tools; have a way to report fires immediately and a simple evacuation plan ready.\n- Temperatures will jump next week, as some areas could be unusually warm, with record highs possible on Christmas.\n- The heat can cause discomfort and raise the risk of heat-related illness, strain cooling systems and increase water demand, and further raise fire risk in already dry areas. Drink plenty of fluids, avoid heavy outdoor activity during the hottest part of the day, check on elderly or other vulnerable people and pets, use shade or air conditioning when possible, protect sensitive plants, and watch local forecasts for updates and any heat advisories.\nFirst Alert Forecast:\nA broad, mostly west-to-east wind flow is keeping the jet stream just north of our area today, so conditions are fairly typical for mid-December with daytime highs in the 40s. A surface ridge over the southeastern U.S. and a low pressure system over the northern High Plains are producing breezy southerly winds, and a thin deck of high clouds is making it feel a bit raw despite the mild air being pushed northward. The dry, windy conditions will keep elevated fire danger through the afternoon, though winds should ease and relative humidity recover this evening.\nA cold front tied to the northern low pressure system will push through northeast Kansas early Saturday and switch winds around to the north, but temperatures will still be a little above normal Saturday afternoon, generally upper 40s to near 50°F. Sunday, our winter solstice, looks much the same with no major changes expected.\nThe bigger story is next week, as an expanding upper-level ridge will bring warming air from the south, so each day should be warmer than the last. Expect highs near 60°F Monday and Tuesday, warming into the mid to upper 60s Wednesday, and likely climbing to around 70°F on Christmas Day. If that verifies, Topeka (record 68°F) and Concordia (record 64°F) could see new record highs. Overall the pattern will keep precipitation away through the holiday, so a warm, mostly dry Christmas is likely.\nChristmas Forecast:\nExpect a warm, mostly dry Christmas period, as confidence is high that temperatures will be well above normal. Christmas Eve looks mild with morning clouds giving way to partial sun and a high in the low to mid 60s. It will be breezy from the southeast at 5–10 mph, and lows that night should be in the mid to upper 40s. Christmas Day should be even warmer, mostly sunny with highs in the mid to upper 60s, perhaps near 70, and southwest winds 10–15 mph. Overnight lows again should stay in the mid to upper 40s. For Topeka and northeast Kansas, that’s much warmer than the average high of about 41°F, and we could challenge the record high for Christmas Day (68°F). Because of these warm conditions, chances for a white Christmas are effectively zero, as Topeka has seen a snow depth of 1 inch or more on only about 22% of past Decembers since 1887. The reason is a strong, amplified ridge of high pressure over the central U.S. that will pull warm Pacific air eastward and suppress precipitation. That pattern favors well-above-normal temperatures across parts of the Four Corners and Southern Plains and generally below-normal rainfall across much of the central and eastern U.S.\nLooking Ahead:\nTonight: Partly Cloudy. Low near 34F. Winds S 5-15 gusts up to 25 mph.\nTomorrow: Partly Cloudy. High 49F. Winds ESE at 10 to 15 mph.\nTomorrow Night: Partly Cloudy. Low 24F. Winds light and variable.\nSunday: Partly Cloudy. High 49F. Winds ESE at 10 to 15 mph.\nAs always, be sure to check in daily for updates, and when storms are in the area, utilize the WIBW Weather App.\nCopyright 2025 WIBW. All rights reserved.",
