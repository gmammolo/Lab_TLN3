  "text": "A warming night ahead with a pleasant weekend expected across the stateline\n- Increasing temperatures tonight\n- Sunny weekend\n- Warmer times next week\n(WIFR) - It is amazing what a difference a day can make. Yesterday we had highs in the mid-40s with wind chills reaching 37 degrees. This morning, wind chills dropped all the way to -14 degrees for a feels like difference of 51 degrees!\nWe’ve stayed cold through our Friday with highs only into the upper teens so far. Tonight, winds will shift to be out of the south to southeast, where warmer air will start to be ushered into the region. We’ll have gusts close to 20 to 25 mph, where our overnight low will likely come around midnight in the upper teens. From there, temperatures will likely be in the lower 30s by the early morning with mostly cloudy skies.\nClouds will hang overhead to kick off our Saturday, with sunshine expected to return by the afternoon. Temperatures will top out in the upper 30s with wind chills just below freezing.\nSkies will remain mostly clear Saturday night, allowing temperatures to fall to the lower teens to upper single digits.\nDownload the First Alert Weather app\nClick here for Interactive Radar\nWhat’s Coming Up...\nTemperatures won’t be able to rebound as well Sunday with the already cold start and the lack of winds. We’ll be underneath a weak high pressure system that will calm our winds and give us plenty of sunshine. Highs will be in the middle to upper 20s, but with sunshine and clam winds I think it will feel relatively pleasant.\nLooking Ahead...\nNext week, our temperatures will take a bit of a flip compared to the past couple of weeks. We’ll see the return of zonal flow at the beginning of next week with a high pressure ridge moving overhead Christmas. These will give us well above normal temperatures with highs in the 40s to even 50s.\nCopyright 2025 WIFR. All rights reserved.",
