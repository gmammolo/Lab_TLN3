  "text": "The Bay Area could get “a December’s worth of rain” over the next week, with a rainy Christmas Day and a Sierra Nevada blanketed with white, the National Weather Service said Friday.\nForecasters said they expect a week-long atmospheric river with three distinct storms to move over Northern California next week.\nJoe Merchant, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Bay Area office, said the first wave of precipitation will begin Friday afternoon and last through Saturday, bringing much-needed rain after around six weeks of mostly dry conditions, especially in the North Bay.",
