  "text": "WARREN, Vt. (WCAX) - Despite the weather whiplash on Friday, ski resorts still expect good conditions for Christmas week.\nDedicated skiers and riders took on Sugarbush on Friday despite the wet conditions.\nThe resort says they’ve had one of their best starts to the season this year, with lots of natural snow and cold temperatures to make snow daily.\n“It’s not ideal to have weather like this but honestly there are some silver linings, one being it replenishes our snow making pond, so we don’t have to worry about running out of water as we pursue snow making and what’s nice about this is it was a pretty quick warm up, it’s already transitioning back to snow,” said the resort’s John Bleh,\nSugarbush’s Mt. Ellen was supposed to open Friday, but due to the weather, they moved opening day to Saturday.\nCopyright 2025 WCAX. All rights reserved.",
