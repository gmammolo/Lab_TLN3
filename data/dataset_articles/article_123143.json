  "text": "Mostly clear skies will be with us through the evening hours tonight so if you need to finish up any Christmas shopping you won't have to worry about rain. It will be chilly with lows tonight dipping into the lower 30s.\nTomorrow after our cold start temperatures will rapidly warm to the low 60s for highs. Sunshine will stay with us all day but as we head towards the overnight hours a quick moving weak cold front will move through. This will bring us more clouds and the chance for a few showers mainly during the overnight hours and first thing on your Sunday.\nSunday afternoon the clouds will begin to clear, our temperatures will only be slightly cooler with highs making it into the middle to upper 50s.\nNext week we will see a few chances for some showers but overall doesn't look like we will see an impactful weather maker for Christmas week. The big story will remain the warm temperatures. Christmas day looks to be in the lower 70s for the area.\nTONIGHT: Mostly clear skies. Lows in the low 30s. Wind: Light SE.\nSATURDAY: Sunny, mild. Breezy. Highs in the lower 60s. Wind: S 10-15 mph, gusts 20 mph.",
