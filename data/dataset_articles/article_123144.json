  "text": "Chilly night tonight with pleasant weekend ahead\nSARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - Today: Happy Friday! Our cold front is passing us right now, but its effects won’t be too noticeable… The main things will be a chillier night tonight, a shift in the winds out of the north, and some drier air!\nTonight: Tonight’s temperatures will fall into the low to mid 50s along the coast and near 50 degrees inland. This is much cooler than last night.\nThe Weekend: However, tomorrow will warm back up, to the mid to upper 70s for the beaches, and to the upper 70s to low 80s inland. Similar conditions are forecast for Sunday.\nThis Week: High pressure will build back in, allowing for an abundance of sunshine and temperatures will increase back to the low 80s areawide as we head throughout next week.\nCopyright 2025 WWSB.
