  "text": "Tracking warm and dry weather for the weekend\nWarm, but pleasant temperatures will carry through the weekend and for the final days of the fall season. I am finally tracking weather changes for Christmas week.\nYUMA, Ariz. (KYMA-TV)- Happy Friday! It's going to be a lovely evening as we will have calm winds and clear skies.\nTonight is day 1 for Christmas at the Crossing at the Colorado River State Historic Park, so if you are going to that or doing any fun holiday activities tonight, make sure to dress warm, it will be chilly.\nA ridge of high pressure will be hanging out for the time being keeping our temperatures warmer than normal with dry and calm weather through the weekend.\nTRAVELCAST: If you are starting your holiday traveling this weekend, there are some moderate and high risks in the Pacific Northwest due to wet weather.\nThe majority of the county is looking pretty good this weekend for traveling, but, I am tracking weather changes for our region come Christmas week.\nWe have a warm, but still nice weekend ahead with daytime highs staying in the 80s and upper 70s. It will be a warm start to the winter season, but still going to be comfortable for us.\nPlus, with this weekend being the last weekend before Christmas, we have a lot of fun events happening this weekend, take a look at our KYMA events page to see what's going on this weekend.\nI am tracking cooler, temperatures, more clouds and rain chances starting Tuesday night through Christmas day.\nTRACKING CHANGES: Looking ahead and with this incoming weather pattern change, on our precipitation outlook, it is showing above-normal rainfall being possible for the region during the next 6-10 days.\nSo we can possibly see some wet for Christmas here in the Desert Southwest. I will keep tracking and bring more updates as it gets closer. Stay tuned.\nSunday, December 21st marks the first day of winter also referred to as the Winter Solstice. Solstices occur twice a year when the sun's path appears farthest north or south depending which part of the planet you're on.\nThis year's Winter Solstice for the Northern Hemisphere brings the shortest day and longest night of the year. The lack of direct sunlight on December 21st makes it the shortest day of the year for those even in the United States.\nWinter will officially begin at 8:03 a.m. in Yuma.",
