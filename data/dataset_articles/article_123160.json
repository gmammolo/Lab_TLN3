  "text": "First Alert Forecast: Windy & warmer Saturday, temperatures drop again Sunday\nFORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - The up and down temperature trend will continue into the weekend, though the results won’t be nearly as dramatic as what just transpired :)\nTemperatures will stay steadily into the teens overnight with a warming trend by sunrise. By the middle of the day Saturday, temperatures will be in the 40s area wide! The trade off? It will also be quite windy with gusts between 25 and 35 mph.\nThe wind and temperature will decrease Saturday night as our next, weaker front slides in. Midday Sunday looks cold, but mostly sunny with highs in the upper 20s to low 30s.\nMonday through Christmas Day will feature progressively warmer temperatures, even if it will stay on the cloudy side of things. Midday Christmas our projected high temperature is 58º, which is close to the record of 64º set back in 1982! Not that that should be too surprising, given the trend the past six years:\nLet me take a crack at forecasting the Christmas high temperature for the next 4 years:\n2026: 18º\n2027: 59º\n2028: 12º\n2029: 57º\nWe’ll check back and see how I did :)\nCopyright 2025 WPTA.
