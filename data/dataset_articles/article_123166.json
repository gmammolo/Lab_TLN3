  "text": "Warm holiday week ahead\nOverall, the weekend is looking mild and sunny. The average high this time of year is in the middle 40s.\nSaturday will be the warmer of the two days, starting off in the mid 30s and warming into the mid 50s by the afternoon.\nMost of us will be in the 50s for highs, but we’ll be very close to 60 a little further south and west.\nThe wind will be out of the south and a little high, too.\nAfter a quick cool down on the first day of winter, we warm right back up and may touch 70 on Christmas Day!\nStorm Alert Team Chief Meteorologist\nRusty Dawkins",
