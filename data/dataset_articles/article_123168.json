  "text": "OTTUMWA, Iowa (KYOU) - After a slight setback this weekend, temperatures surge toward Christmas.\nWe’ll actually see temperatures go higher overnight, starting in the 20s and reaching the 30s by daybreak. Mostly cloudy skies develop, too. This is all ahead of a cold front that will move through on Saturday morning.\nBehind this front, temperatures will start to fall from the 40s around midday. Northwesterly winds will help this happen, but they won’t be anywhere near as gusty as what we felt on Thursday. The net result is a day that will start in the 20s on Sunday, only reaching near 40 for a high.\nWe’ll say goodbye to the 40s after that, but not in the way you might expect for December. Instead, highs will be in the 50s for most of us on Monday through Thursday. Some spots by Thursday, which many celebrate as Christmas, could top 60. That’s exceptionally warm for this time of year. Things look dry during this time, too, which is generally good news for travelers.\nA bit of a cooldown takes place toward next weekend, but readings should still be a bit above normal.",
