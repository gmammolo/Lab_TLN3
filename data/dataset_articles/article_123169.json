  "text": "By Kaylee Barbee ,\n1 hours ago\nCOLUMBUS, Ga. (WRBL)- Happy Friday! It has been a wonderful end to the week.\nThis Weekend: For everyone heading out this weekend, temperatures are set to take a dip tonight. By Sunday, those readings will rebound again into the upper 60s. A weak disturbance will bring more clouds Sunday afternoon.\nNext Week: As this weak front clears, we will see passing clouds through Tuesday. Meanwhile, temperatures will keep warming up next week. We will be flirting with 70s by Tuesday, with lows in the 40s.\nChristmas: Our Christmas temperatures are trending well above average. Christmas Eve will sit in the low-70s (lows in the upper 40s) with passing clouds. Christmas Day will be pleasant but warm. Get ready for clear skies and highs in the low-70s.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
