  "text": "By Bryan Hale ,\n54 minutes ago\nHARLINGEN, Texas ( ValleyCentral ) — It’s beginning to look a lot like Spring for Christmas this year.\nSeveral factors are conspiring to deliver an abnormally warm Christmas, including the days leading up to the big event.\nThe polar jet stream is forecast to recede north toward Canada, allowing high pressure to force warmer air northward and that will have everyone from the Rio Grande Valley to Chicago enjoying a green Christmas. The best chance for a white Christmas will be Upstate New York, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the northern Rockies, Sierra, and Cascade mountains.\nPartly cloudy skies and gusty southeast winds will help push temperatures into the low 80’s on Christmas Day here in the RGV.\nIf you think highs in the low to mid 80’s are crazy for Christmas, think again! When looking back, the record warmest Christmas goes to McAllen with 92° back in 1964.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
