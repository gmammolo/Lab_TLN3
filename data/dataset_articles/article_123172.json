  "text": "As we wrap up this Friday, we're seeing conditions improve with clouds eroding and clearing this evening for much of the area. Winds have been gusty, but they're expected to calm down overnight. However, don't get too comfortable with the quiet start to the weekend, because we're monitoring some big changes!\nLooking ahead to Saturday, we'll see increasing sunshine through the day, but get ready for those winds to pick up again, becoming gusty from the SW as a cold front approaches. We will be keeping an eye on wind gusts potentially peaking between 25 to 30 mph. This front will bring cooler air briefly, but it's just a \"speed bump\" on the way to a much warmer trend.\nThe real story begins early next week. A moderating pattern is setting up, and we're forecasting temperatures to become well above normal, lasting through Christmas Day.\nThis means we are looking at a string of days with significantly milder weather than we typically see for this time of year. We could even be flirting with some near-record high temperatures in the 60s, possibly reaching the low 60s by Christmas Day itself!\nThis is quite a contrast to what we'd expect for late December. Throughout this mild stretch, we'll likely see periods of cloudiness and chances for light rain from Monday night through Christmas Eve, as moist flow interacts with weak boundaries.",
