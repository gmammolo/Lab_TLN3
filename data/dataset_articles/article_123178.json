  "text": "SNOQUALMIE PASS, Wash. — Washington's roads could finally see some ski traffic this weekend, thanks to a round of heavy snow in the mountains.\nSeveral ski areas are optimistic that the latest storm will bring enough snow to open the slopes in some capacity.\nA Winter Storm Warning is in effect until 4 p.m. Saturday. Total snow accumulations of 2 feet are possible at Stevens and Snoqualmie passes. Up to 3 feet of snow could fall at Mount Baker.\nCrystal Mountain\nCrystal Mountain opens Saturday, Dec. 20, with limited operations from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Crystal Mountain is capping the number of parking reservations to reduce the number of drivers due to damage on Highway 410. The parking reservations will be in effect through at least January.\nSkiers, snowboarders and visitors should not visit Crystal Mountain without a parking reservation, the resort said. If you arrive without a parking reservation, you’ll be turned around.\nThe Crystal Mountain Express Shuttle is not running at this time, the resort said. Ski and ride school is not available opening weekend.\nMount Baker\nPassholder Day could be as early as Saturday, Dec. 20, with an official opening day of Sunday, Dec. 21, according to the resort website.\nHowever, as of Friday afternoon, Mount Baker Highway (state Route 542) is closed at Milepost 35 due to damage caused by flooding.\nThe ski resort is working with the state to get its crew to the mountain so they can prepare for opening day.\nMission Ridge\nAfter being the first ski resort to open for the season, Mission Ridge closed again after an atmospheric river impacted the snow conditions and left cleanup work.\nSunday, Dec. 21, is the earliest possible reopening date if conditions permit, according to the Mission Ridge website.\nWhite Pass\nAccording to the ski resort's website, lifts will not be running Dec. 20. However, White Pass is \"holding out hope\" to run limited operations on Sunday, Dec. 21.\nSummit at Snoqualmie\nIn an email to KING 5 on Thursday, the Summit at Snoqualmie said it hopes to open by Monday, Dec. 22.\nOn Friday, full-day lift tickets were available Dec. 23.\nStevens Pass\nOpening date remains up in the air, not only because of snowpack, but because Highway 2 between Skykomish and Leavenworth remains closed due to damage sustained by flooding.\nEmergency work to repair a 12-mile stretch between Mileposts 58 and 70 over Stevens Pass began Dec. 18. Work to clear debris over a 2-mile stretch of the road east of Skykomish begins Dec. 20.",
