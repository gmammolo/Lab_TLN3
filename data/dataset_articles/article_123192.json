  "text": "By No media credit provided. ,\n2 hours ago\nExpect a midday cold front on Saturday. Winds will snap into the North and gust, but with sunshine OKC will still see 65 degrees! Cooling off some for Saturday evening. Much less wind on Sunday with cool temperatures. Statewide record highs on Christmas Day with the warmth building in strongly beginning Tuesday. Parts of our State may see at least a chance of much needed moisture in about 9 days, watching that! Mike #okwx 12.19.25\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
