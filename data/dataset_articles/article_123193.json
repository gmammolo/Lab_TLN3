  "text": "Sunshine and the 60s return this weekend\nWarm weekend ahead\nThis calm pattern sticks with us through the weekend. Saturday brings plenty of dry weather and mild temperatures, topping out in the mid-50s under mostly clear to partly cloudy skies. Sunday is our pick day of the entire week as things warm up even more, with highs climbing back into the 60s, making it a great day to get outside or wrap up last-minute holiday errands.\nAs we roll into next week, Monday cools things off slightly, with highs dipping back into the lower 50s. But don’t let that fool you, winter doesn’t stick around for long. A noticeable warm-up arrives just in time for Christmas, with afternoon highs jumping into the mid to upper 60s. If you’re dreaming of a mild, comfortable holiday, Charlotte is delivering this year. Christmas day is flirting with highs touching 70 degrees! Stay tuned!",
