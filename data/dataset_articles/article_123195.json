  "text": "Good evening and happy Friday! We’re about to enter a long period of seasonally warm temperatures starting after this weekend.\nThe Weekend Ahead This weekend looks like it will be pretty normal. Temperatures will be above average, but not by an extreme amount. Saturday looks to be about 10 degrees above average, while Sunday looks to be about 5. This is nothing compared to what we will be seeing as we head towards the end of next week. Saturday could be breezy, but winds calm down a bit heading into Sunday.\nNext Big Change After this weekend, temperatures ramp up relatively quickly as we head into the middle of the work week. We’ll be in the 50s on Monday, around 60 on Tuesday, then in the upper 60s by Wednesday. For Christmas we’re looking at temperatures around 70, and could be trending even warmer. The record high that could be broken is 74 degrees set in 1889. We’ll keep an eye on it.\nNext weekend temperatures calm down a tad, but look to remain moderately above average as we head towards the new year.\nSuccess! An email has been sent to with a link to confirm list signup.\nError! There was an error processing your request.",
