  "text": "By Jason Parkin No media credit provided. ,\n8 hours ago DES MOINES, Iowa — We had a chilly start to Friday but, under sunshine, weather conditions have improved as winds have died down. We’ll see both increasing temperatures and cloud cover overnight.\nThis is normally the place in the blog where we talk about precipitation chances coming at us in the next seven days. However, there really aren’t any. We’ll see a bit of a temperature roller coaster over the next few days before temperatures warm through Christmas.\nHighs and your WHO 13 7-day forecasts are above. As you’ll see, this years Christmas could end up being one of the warmest on record here in Des Moines. Extended forecasts also keep us on the warm and dry side.\nIowa News: Copyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
