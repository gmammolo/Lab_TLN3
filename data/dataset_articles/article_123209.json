  "text": "Buffalo, NY – Strong southwest winds are ramping up across western New York this afternoon and will continue into Friday, creating hazardous travel conditions and the potential for scattered power outages across the region.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Buffalo, a Wind Advisory is in effect from 3 p.m. Thursday through 1 a.m. Saturday for Erie, Niagara, Orleans, Monroe, Genesee, Wyoming, Livingston, Ontario, Cattaraugus, and Allegany counties. Winds of 15 to 25 mph are expected, with gusts reaching up to 50 mph this afternoon, tonight, and again on Friday as winds turn westerly behind a passing system.\nIn the Buffalo metro, the strongest gusts may make travel difficult on the Thruway, I-190, I-290, and along the Lake Erie shoreline. Unsecured holiday decorations, garbage bins, and outdoor furniture could be blown around, while a few tree limbs may come down, leading to isolated power outages. Rain develops tonight and may briefly mix with or change to snow Friday morning, with minor accumulations possible in heavier bursts.\nWinds remain strong through Friday evening before slowly easing overnight into Saturday. Conditions improve over the weekend, though it stays chilly with occasional light snow chances. Looking ahead, the pattern calms early next week, with Christmas Eve on Wednesday currently trending quieter and seasonable for western New York, offering improved conditions for holiday travel and last-minute preparations.\nThe Wind Advisory remains in effect into early Saturday, and additional updates may be issued as conditions evolve.",
