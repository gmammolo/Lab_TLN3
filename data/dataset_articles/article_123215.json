  "text": "DETROIT LAKES — In Fargo, seeing blizzard-like conditions in the forecast means it is time to get the shovels and winter coats.\nAt Detroit Mountain though, they cannot get enough of it, especially after the lack of natural snow the past few winters.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“We get excited if there's a blizzard coming that's going to dump a lot of snow on us,” said Mandy Sharp, guest services manager at Detroit Mountain.\nShe has spent every winter since 2017 at Detroit Mountain.\nOver the past couple years, Sharp has learned the necessary amount of natural snow for their slopes is not guaranteed.\nAnd while they have the ability to make artificial snow using snow guns, it is just not the same.\n“I think people see snow, and then they think snow, and then they're coming out to play with us. So it's great. The snow, the snow everywhere, helps us a lot,” Sharp said.\nIt does not just affect attendance. It also affects the mountain's terrain and how people navigate down the trails.\nSharp says the combination of natural snow and perfect snow-making conditions is creating a better experience for skiers and snowboarders, and it is leading to lots of anticipation about what the 2025-26 season could bring to Detroit Mountain.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“I feel like we've already seen busier crowds on weekends and weeknights. And it seems like the community is ready to ski and snowboard again,” Sharp said.\nOne new attraction that skiers can look forward to this winter season is a lit-up, cross-country Nordic ski trail.\nInterim Executive Director Jenny Sheets says that thanks to a grant and more snow on the way, they will have the grand opening by the end of December.\nSharp hopes that, weather pending, Detroit Mountain can be open for 16 of the next 18 days.\nFor more information on hours, pricing and upcoming events, visit\nhttps://detroitmountain.com/\n.",
