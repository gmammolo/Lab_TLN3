  "text": "By Tara Lane ,\n1 hours ago\n( PINPOINT WEATHER ) — After a drier, sunny but blustery Friday, the wind will be much more settled throughout the weekend. Overall, weather is looking pretty good this weekend before Christmas!\nWe’ll see lots of sunshine Saturday with highs in the 50s, and we’ll end up around 60 for Sunday. Great weather for the Panthers game! A mostly dry cold front will move in Sunday, dropping temperatures about 10 degrees for Monday afternoon.\nAnother front approaches by Christmas Eve, but any rain looks limited to the mountain communities.\nThe big story next week will be the warm Christmas holiday! Highs will be rising through the 60s, with some 70s by the end of the week.\nTonight : Clear and cold. Low 31.\nSaturday : Sunny, less wind. High 56.\nSunday : Sun & clouds. 35/60.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
