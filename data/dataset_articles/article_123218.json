  "text": "First Alert Forecast: Calmer & cooler, watching a warmup in KOTA Territory\nRAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA) -We’ve got some snow showers moving through the area in the Sheridan and Spearfish areas. We’re expecting snow showers to move generally from Northwest to Southeast throughout KOTA Territory, and some of us could get a half-inch of snow, maybe more, if you’re headed through the Black Hills and into Northeast Wyoming. Beyond that, there is potential for 1 to 3 inches, and a winter weather advisory remains in effect for Sheridan County until midnight.\nAs the snow moves out of that area, we generally see isolated to scattered snow showers in Southwestern South Dakota between 1:00 and 3:00, before we clear out and cool things way down. We’ll see 20s and teens tonight in our area, with the highest likelihood of teens north and east of I-90. Generally, you should be in the mid to upper 20s in the lowlands from I-90 south. You could see some low 20s in the Black Hills.\nIt’s not just temperatures that are decreasing. Wind gusts will diminish overnight from 40 to 20 mph in the Rapid City area. We still have a slight chance of breezy weather, especially as you head into Northwestern South Dakota, where we could see 35 mph gusts from about Sturgis northward to Buffalo. That might make these temperatures feel a little cooler, especially the 42 in Belle Fourche, 36 in Buffalo, and 35 in Faith, but as you go down towards I-90, you’ll see some lower 40s.\nHigh pressure will make a big difference in our forecast going forward. You’ll see that in some warmer air pushing northward, and that’s the way it stays throughout most of the week, with Christmas Eve potentially a mighty warm day before we cool things off just a tad on Christmas Day. It appears that models are attempting to quickly moderate the situation with a system running into next weekend, aiming to bring temperatures back down to the 40s.\nWe’ll also be keeping an eye on the extended forecast, as current trends point to Winter returning by just after New Year’s Day. So those of you who are looking at that Christmas forecast and thinking about wearing shorts and t-shirts, thinking, where in the world is the snow? Well, you may be looking to that time period for some hope!\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story? Please click here to report it.\nDo you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?
