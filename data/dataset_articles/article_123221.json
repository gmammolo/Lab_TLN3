  "text": "By Christian Boteler ,\n17 hours ago WOAY-TV (Oak Hill, WV): After some loud and strong thunderstorms and showers moved through last night, wet and windy conditions will continue through the morning. A switch from rain to a wintery mix is expected thanks to the cold front that has passed up by, dropping temperatures below freezing this morning. These showers will also bring gusty winds to the region. Conditions will calm down in the afternoon as cloudy skies remain through the day.
