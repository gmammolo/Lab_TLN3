  "text": "By Matt Hefner ,\n4 hours ago\nToday brought a slight hiccup in an overall warming trend, but thankfully, warmer weather is waiting just around the corner.\nSoutherly winds will begin ushering in warmer temperatures tonight, setting the stage for a very beautiful Saturday. Tomorrow, we’ll aim for the 60-degree mark under generally sunny skies. It’s worth noting that winds will be gusty early in the day, with gusts exceeding 30 mph possible.\nA cold front will arrive Saturday night, stripping away some of the late-December warmth. Highs on Sunday will only peak in the low 50s, though skies will remain mostly sunny.\nOnce we get past the weekend, temperatures are expected to soar just in time for Santa. We’ll be chasing record highs from Tuesday through Friday, with daily chances of reaching the 70s.\nFor those curious, we’ve only hit 70 degrees on Christmas twice, with the most recent occurrence more than 50 years ago.\nWhile a white Christmas may not be in the forecast this year, break out the short sleeves and enjoy this rare end-of-year warm-up.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
