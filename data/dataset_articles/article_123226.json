  "text": "By Joe Fitzwater ,\n1 hours ago\nSaturday sees high pressure scoot to our east during the day and that will enable a southerly breeze to return once again. As a result, temperatures will rebound nicely as we see high temperatures jump back up into the low to mid 50s with mostly sunny skies expected. Many Coalfields towns should not have a problem getting close to 60 degrees. Temperatures won’t be quite as cold overnight with lows near freezing under partly cloudy skies.\nSunday begins winter with the winter solstice at 10:03 AM. Happy winter! A weak cold front will cross during the pre-dawn hours, and though we won’t see any rain from that, cooler air does return with a Canadian high pressure system kicking in. As a result, temperatures will be colder than on Saturday with high temperatures in the low 40s.\nMonday remains dry with high pressure scooting off to our east, enabling a southerly flow to return. That once again will bring warmer temperatures back into the region – a trend that will continue for much of our Christmas week ahead! After a cold start in the low 20s, we will see temperatures rebound nicely with high temperatures in the mid to upper 40s.\nTuesday sees a warm front lift north, which will really open the gates to some warmer temperatures just in time for the approaching Christmas holiday. That comes with a caveat though – we will be expecting light showers with that warm front lifting north on Tuesday, mainly during the morning. Temperatures will warm up nicely though with highs jumping into the low to mid 50s.\nStormTracker 59’s 2025-26 Winter Season Outlook for the two-Virginias Christmas Eve keeps the risk for an isolated shower or two but most of us will be dry with a weak front nearby. A southerly flow continues to warm is up with highs jumping up into the mid to upper 50s. Our Coalfield towns will make a run into the 60s!\nChristmas sees another warm front lifting north and that will warm temperatures up even more. Unfortunately, that front crossing will keep the risk for a few showers around. High temperatures though look to make a run into the low 60s! Interestingly, we have had some pretty warm Christmas day in recent years – three of the last ten Christmas days featured high temperatures in the 60s, with the last time that occurred being back in 2021. It looks like we have another of those to add!\nFriday will be a quiet day with high pressure across the Gulf. This is going to continue to make for a very warm pattern with partly sunny skies and highs in the low to mid 60s!\nLooking ahead in your extended forecast, another warm day in the 60s for highs on Saturday will be followed by a strong cold front that will cool us down on Sunday. High temperatures will dip back into the 50s on Sunday with the potential for some gusty winds once again. Temperatures may briefly drop into the 40s for highs on Monday but we look to warm right back up as we head into the beginning of 2026.\nSATURDAY\nMostly sunny. Highs in the low to mid 50s.\nSUNDAY\nPartly sunny. Cooler. Highs in the low 40s.\nMONDAY\nPartly sunny. Highs in the mid to upper 40s.\nTUESDAY\nLight showers likely. Cloudy. Highs in the low to mid 50s.\nCHRISTMAS EVE\nStray shower or two. Partly sunny. Highs in the mid to upper 50s.\nCHRISTMAS DAY\nFew showers. Very warm! Highs in the low 60s.\nFRIDAY\nPartly sunny. Very warm! Highs in the low to mid 60s.\nSATURDAY\nPartly sunny. Still warm! Highs in the 60s.\nSUNDAY\nGusty showers. Gloomy. Cooler. Highs in the 50s.\nMONDAY\nMostly sunny. Cooler. Highs in the 40s.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
