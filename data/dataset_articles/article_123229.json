  "text": "Good Friday! Our Friday night will be clear and cold with lows tonight falling into the mid to upper 20s. Fear not, as we progress through our Saturday, we will warm nicely to a high of 60. A weak front will move through Saturday night. It will bring some clouds and MAYBE a few sprinkles overnight into Sunday morning.\nSunday is the first official day of winter. However, it will be mild in the afternoon with the high reaching 58. We will have a nice amount of sun through the weekend.\nMonday will be a bit colder in the morning with a low of 33, but we are back into the mid-50s for the afternoon.\nTuesday will be mostly cloudy with a few showers. We will make it to 61 for the high.\nChristmas Eve will be mostly cloudy with the high ratcheting up to 67.\nNo white Christmas this year! On Christmas morning, we will be in the low 50s. In the afternoon, we will have mostly cloudy skies and a whopping high of 72. The record high for Christmas is 75!\nWe will stay in the low 70s with partly cloudy skies on Friday as well.\nFor the latest, download the Local 3 Weather app. David Karnes",
