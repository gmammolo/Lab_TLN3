  "text": "Tourists enjoy a breezy morning along Pattaya Beach as cooler temperatures bring a refreshing start to the day following a slight seasonal dip. (Photo by Jetsada Homklin) PATTAYA, Thailand – Pattaya and surrounding areas are set to experience cooler mornings over the next 24 hours, with temperatures expected to drop slightly as a high-pressure system continues to cover upper Thailand, the Meteorological Department said on Thursday.\nAccording to the forecast, residents in Pattaya and Chonburi province can expect mild to cool conditions in the early morning hours, especially near coastal and open areas. While daytime temperatures will remain warm, the cooler start to the day marks a noticeable change in weather, prompting health advisories for the public, particularly children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.\nThe cooler conditions are attributed to a persistent cold air mass spreading across upper Thailand, combined with westerly winds moving in from Myanmar that are influencing weather patterns in the North and upper Northeast. Although Pattaya is not expected to see a significant temperature drop, the city will feel slightly fresher mornings compared to previous days.\nSea conditions in the Gulf of Thailand remain moderate, with waves generally reaching 1–2 metres offshore. Mariners and small boat operators are advised to exercise caution, particularly in areas experiencing gusty winds or isolated thunderstorms.\nElsewhere in the South, heavy rainfall is forecast in parts of Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat provinces, raising concerns over possible flash floods and runoff in low-lying and hillside areas. Pattaya, however, is expected to see mainly dry conditions, supporting normal tourism and outdoor activities.\nAir quality in central Thailand, including Pattaya and the Eastern Seaboard, remains at moderate levels, with dust and haze accumulation considered manageable due to fairly good air circulation.\nAuthorities advise residents and visitors in Pattaya to dress appropriately for cooler mornings, stay hydrated during warmer afternoons, and follow marine safety warnings when engaging in water activities.",
