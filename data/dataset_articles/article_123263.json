  "text": "Charleston, SC — Anyone hoping for a cold or wintry Christmas in the Charleston area is likely to be disappointed this year, as forecasts point to unseasonably warm temperatures across coastal South Carolina and much of the Southeast .\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Charleston , there is an increased probability of above-normal temperatures across southeast Georgia and South Carolina through the Christmas holiday and into the final days of 2025. Daytime highs on Christmas Day, Wednesday, December 25 , are expected to reach the upper 60s to near 70 degrees in the Charleston metro area.\nForecasters say the warm pattern is not limited to Christmas Day. The 8- to 14-day temperature outlook , covering December 27 through January 2 , shows much of the eastern and central United States, including the Carolinas, favored to remain warmer than average as the new year begins.\nMaps released by the National Weather Service show Charleston and surrounding Lowcountry communities firmly within the zone of above-normal temperature probabilities , while colder-than-average air remains largely confined to parts of the western United States.\nThe mild conditions mean there is no chance of a white Christmas for coastal South Carolina, and overnight lows are expected to stay well above freezing. While the warmth may benefit holiday travelers and outdoor gatherings, officials note that it can also feel unusual for late December.\nMeteorologists say the persistent warmth is being driven by a large-scale weather pattern that continues to funnel mild air across the Southeast, limiting opportunities for cold air intrusions.\nResidents are encouraged to monitor daily forecasts for any changes, but forecasters say confidence is increasing that warm weather will dominate through the end of 2025 and into early 2026 .",
