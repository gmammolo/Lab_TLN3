  "text": "Roanoke, VA — Residents across southwest and central Virginia can expect an unusually warm Christmas Day this year, with temperatures climbing into the mid-60s in Roanoke , putting the holiday among the warmest Christmases on record , though likely falling short of all-time highs.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Blacksburg , maximum temperatures on Thursday, December 25 , are forecast to reach around 65 degrees in Roanoke , near 61 degrees in Lynchburg and Blacksburg , and about 59 degrees in Bluefield, West Virginia . A white Christmas is not expected anywhere in the region.\nClimate data shows Roanoke’s warmest Christmas Day on record was 69 degrees , set in 2021 , with several other years reaching the upper 60s. While this year’s forecast is unlikely to break that record, it may still rank within the top 10 warmest Christmas Days observed in the city.\nIn Lynchburg, Christmas Day temperatures have reached 72 degrees in both 1982 and 2021 , the warmest on record. Forecast highs near 61 degrees this year would place 2025 among Lynchburg’s milder Christmases, though well below record territory.\nBlacksburg’s warmest Christmas Day was 68 degrees in 1964 , with several other years reaching the mid-60s. A projected high near 61 degrees again places this year within the upper tier of historical warmth. Bluefield’s record Christmas high stands at 66 degrees , set in 2015 , with this year’s forecast also approaching the top 10.\nForecasters say the warmth is being driven by a mild air mass and lack of sustained cold air ahead of the holiday. While the temperatures may feel more like early spring than late December, officials note conditions remain seasonally quiet, with no major weather hazards expected.\nResidents planning holiday travel or outdoor gatherings are encouraged to enjoy the mild conditions, while staying updated on any late forecast changes.",
