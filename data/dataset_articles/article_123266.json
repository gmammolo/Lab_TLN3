  "text": "SODA SPRINGS, Calif. — After a mostly dry start to winter, snow is finally falling in the Sierra, bringing relief and excitement for skiers who have been waiting weeks for conditions to change.\nSnow in mid-December shouldn’t feel unusual, but after weeks of dry weather, it came as a long-awaited moment for students on the mountain.\nSmith Macosko, a student and skier, summed up the frustration.\n\"I think it’s insanity,\" said Macosko.\nMiles Riedel, also a student and skier, said the timing felt off but welcomed the change.\n“It feels a little bit late to have snow, but it is better to have it now,” he said.\nFor Charlie Myers, another student skier, the delay had been hard to watch.\n“I feels that it’s like really sad that like it’s so late into the season,” Myers said.\nWhile Friday’s storm brought smiles on the slopes, it also created hazardous travel conditions. California Highway Patrol in Truckee reported multiple spinouts over Donner Summit, briefly forcing chain controls to go into effect.\nThe first system brought a mix of rain and snow across the area, but a stronger storm is expected next. Boreal Mountain Resort announced it will temporarily suspend operations through Monday due to safety risks from an incoming atmospheric river.\nThe closure is a short-term setback, but resort officials say it could bring long-term benefits.\n“We are really excited for that Christmas miracle to come hit not just for Boreal but all of Tahoe,” said Tucker Norred, marketing director at Boreal Mountain Resort.\nWarming temperatures before the storm have limited snowmaking, but crews are preparing to take advantage of colder conditions.\n“Standing by 24 hours a day and they flip those guns on every chance that we get,\" said Norred.\nFor young skiers like Thomas Conway, the wait is nearly over.\n“I am pretty excited since clearly it’s snowing I’m ready to ski,” Conway said, later adding “It is a Christmas miracle.”\nWATCH MORE ON ABC10 | Atmospheric river drives California rain and Sierra snow into Christmas",
