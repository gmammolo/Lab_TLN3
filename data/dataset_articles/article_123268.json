  "text": "Sunshine returns to Central Oregon, for one day\nToday will be a pleasant, sunny, and dry day with light winds and cool temperatures. The afternoon highs will be hovering around the low to middle 40s as we see the sun for the first time in a few days.\nSnow may arrive right before midnight, so a few clouds will move in late in the day.\nSunday will once again be a rainy day with the chance for a wintry mix to mingle in with the showers. Snow is likely to arrive before sunrise, then quickly change over to a wintry mix. The rain will be light and off and on, so the region should not experience any flooding issues, but if some pockets of rain persist in some saturated areas, they may be slightly impacted. The afternoon highs will be close to 50, so the wintry mix will mainly be in the morning.\nMonday will be a dry and breezy day as the region relaxes between rainy days. The highs will top out in the upper 40s as the well above normal pattern persists.\nTuesday will see the chance for a passing shower as an area of low pressure, well to the south, will push a few bands of light rain and snow through Central Oregon.\nGusty winds start us off on Wednesday then settle down as the day moves along. Christmas Eve day will be dry and mild for December as temps reach the middle 40s.\nChristmas Day may see a flurry or two in the pre-dawn hours but not enough to accumulate. The kiddos will wake up to a wet lawn and fields as opposed to the chance for a “White” Christmas. Slight chance for some rain is more likely.\nPlease, Stay safe.\nDon’t forget to download the Local Alert Weather App to stay connected with our team of meteorologists.\nYou can get access to LIVE radar and receive urgent weather alerts so you’re always prepared.",
