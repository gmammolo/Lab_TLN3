  "text": "Baltimore, MD – Maryland could be heading into 2026 with an unusually warm start, as long-range forecasts signal near-record temperatures developing across the region in the days following Christmas and continuing into the New Year.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the 8–14 day temperature outlook for Saturday, December 27 through Friday, January 2 favors above-normal temperatures across most of the Mid-Atlantic, including Baltimore, the Washington suburbs, the Eastern Shore, and western Maryland.\nFor Baltimore, forecasters say daytime highs during the post-Christmas to New Year’s stretch could climb well above typical late-December averages, with some days potentially approaching or challenging long-standing daily records. Late December is usually one of the colder periods of the year, making the projected warmth especially notable for the region.\nMeteorologists attribute the mild pattern to a broad ridge of high pressure expected to dominate much of the eastern United States, limiting cold air intrusions from Canada and keeping winter storm systems largely displaced to the north.\nThe warmth may persist beyond the New Year. NOAA’s Week 3–4 outlook for January 3–16, 2026 continues to lean above average for temperatures across much of Maryland, particularly in central and eastern portions of the state. While forecast confidence decreases farther out, the overall signal suggests a mild start to January rather than a quick return to deep winter cold.\nThe extended warmth could affect energy demand, travel conditions, and winter recreation, especially in lower elevations where snow chances may remain limited. Forecasters caution that winter patterns can still shift quickly, but for now, all signs point toward a warm opening to 2026.",
