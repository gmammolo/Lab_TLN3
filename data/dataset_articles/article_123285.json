  "text": "Wichita, KS — Kansas is poised for an unusually warm end to 2025 and a mild start to 2026, with forecast trends pointing toward near-record temperatures during the period from December 27 through January 2. As of Saturday, December 20, long-range guidance suggests winter’s coldest air will largely bypass the central Plains as the calendar flips to the New Year.\nAccording to the latest outlooks from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, Kansas sits within a broad region favored for above-normal temperatures. A strong upper-level ridge centered over the central United States is expected to suppress Arctic outbreaks while allowing warmer air from the southwest to dominate much of the region.\nIn Wichita, where average late-December highs typically hover in the mid-40s, daytime temperatures could climb into the 50s and potentially near 60 degrees during the days leading up to New Year’s. Several afternoons may challenge daily temperature records if sunshine and southerly winds align. Overnight lows are also forecast to run above normal, limiting the potential for hard freezes.\nThe mild pattern may bring practical impacts. Snow chances appear low, and any precipitation that does occur is more likely to fall as rain. This could benefit holiday travel but may delay the onset of sustained winter conditions across central and southern Kansas. Gusty winds at times could also enhance the warmth, especially ahead of passing weather systems.\nLooking beyond New Year’s Day, the warmth may linger. The January 3–16, 2026 temperature outlook continues to favor above-normal temperatures across Kansas, suggesting the state could experience an extended mild stretch into mid-January before colder air has a chance to return.\nOverall, Kansas appears set to begin 2026 with springlike warmth by winter standards, reflecting a broader national trend toward late-December and early-January heat across much of the central United States.",
