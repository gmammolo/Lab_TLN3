  "text": "Rainy weather brings relief to Balochistan after long drought\nPakistan\nThe PMD forecast indicates that on December 21, rainfall is expected in northern Ziarat and surrounding areas, with a possibility of snowfall in mountainous regions.\nQUETTA (Dunya News) - Balochistan received widespread rainfall after a prolonged dry spell, bringing relief from drought-like conditions across the province.\nAccording to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), light rain was recorded in Quetta and its surrounding areas early Saturday morning, refreshing the atmosphere and lowering temperatures.\nPMD also forecast that a western weather system has entered Balochistan, under which rainfall is expected in nearly 70 per cent of the province. Intermittent light rain has already been reported in areas including Gwadar, Nokundi, Dalbandin, Taftan, Kalat and Hub, while more regions are likely to receive rain over the next 24 hours.\nThe PMD forecast indicates that on December 21, rainfall is expected in northern Ziarat and surrounding areas, with a possibility of snowfall in mountainous regions, which could further intensify cold conditions. Districts such as Chagai, Nushki, Washuk, Panjgur, Kech, Gwadar, Kalat and Mastung are also expected to receive rain.\nMeanwhile, Quetta, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Ziarat, Harnai, Chaman, Musa Khel and Zhob may experience rainfall accompanied by snowfall on nearby hills.\nAuthorities have advised citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during rain and snowfall, particularly in hilly and mountainous areas, and to follow safety precautions to prevent accidents.\nMeteorological experts say the recent rains are highly beneficial for Balochistan, as they are expected to improve groundwater levels, support agriculture and reduce the long-standing effects of drought in the region.",
