  "text": "Sharjah invites residents to enjoy parks amid improved weather\nSharjah City Municipality announced the reopening of public parks on Saturday following temporary closures due to unstable weather.\nThe municipality used social media to invite residents to safely enjoy the winter season.\nParks were closed on Friday as a safety measure after heavy rains and persistent storms across the UAE. Public parking fees were also temporarily suspended to ease residents’ movement during the thunderstorms.\nThe municipality confirmed that medical fitness centres will resume operations today during official working hours, following improved weather conditions.\nResidents were advised to remain cautious as authorities continued monitoring the situation.\nAfter two days of heavy rain, thunder, and lightning, Wednesday and Thursday brought bright and sunny skies across most of the UAE.\nNorthern regions, however, should expect moderate to heavy showers today, while other areas may see partly cloudy skies with a slight chance of scattered light rain.\nSharjah City Municipality praised its own planning, collaboration with stakeholders, and community support in managing the recent unstable weather and localised water accumulation. Teams worked efficiently to address reports, remove water, and minimise disruption caused by low air pressure, ensuring safety and smooth operations across the city.\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",
