  "text": "St. Louis, MO — The St. Louis region is heading into the Christmas holiday with unseasonably warm, springlike temperatures , a sharp contrast to typical late-December weather.\nAccording to the National Weather Service in St. Louis , a prolonged warm pattern will dominate the region through Christmas Eve and Christmas Day , with daytime highs climbing into the mid-60s to mid-70s . Forecasters say this stretch of warmth will be the peak of the pattern, making it feel more like early spring than the week before Christmas.\nHigh temperatures are expected to run well above normal from Tuesday through Saturday , with the warmest days centered on Tuesday, December 24, and Wednesday, December 25 . During that period, highs between 65 and 75 degrees are forecast across eastern Missouri and southwest Illinois, putting some locations within range of record highs .\nThe National Weather Service notes that while records are not guaranteed to be broken, the forecast warmth is unusual enough to warrant attention. Normal highs for late December in St. Louis typically sit in the low to mid-40s , meaning temperatures could run 20 to 30 degrees above average .\nThe mild weather means no chance of a white Christmas for the St. Louis area, with no snow or wintry precipitation expected. Overnight lows are also forecast to remain relatively mild, staying well above freezing for much of the period.\nMeteorologists say the warmth is being driven by a persistent upper-level pattern that continues to funnel mild air into the central United States while keeping colder air locked farther north.\nWhile the weather should be favorable for holiday travel and outdoor activities , residents are reminded that conditions can still change quickly this time of year. Forecasters will continue monitoring for any shifts later in the week.",
