  "text": "South Carolina – Cold air settles into the Midlands early this morning, clinging to windshields and grass with a faint winter bite. Breath shows briefly in the dark as temperatures hover in the low 30s, but the chill won’t last long.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, clear skies and calm winds allow temperatures to rebound quickly today. Highs climb into the upper 50s by afternoon, with full sunshine helping pavement dry and neighborhoods warm fast. Early drivers may notice patchy frost on vehicles, but road conditions remain dry.\nSunday brings an even bigger warm-up. Sunshine dominates again as highs surge into the mid-60s. Light winds and low humidity make it feel more like late fall than winter. Outdoor plans, yard work, and travel across I-20 and I-26 should face no weather delays.\nSunday night cools back into the mid-30s, keeping a mild winter rhythm in place. Monday stays sunny with highs in the mid-50s, followed by another cool but quiet night. No rain or winter precipitation appears in the short-term picture.\nBy Tuesday, warmth builds again. Highs return to the mid-60s with partly sunny skies, setting up a very travel-friendly stretch ahead of Christmas. While colder air dominates much of the Midwest and Northeast, the Southeast remains on the warm side of the pattern.\nFor now, there are no signs of snow, ice, or freezing rain for central South Carolina. Still, early mornings can surprise drivers with frost on bridges or shaded spots. Allow a few extra minutes during the coldest hours and keep an eye on pets and plants sensitive to chilly nights.\nAs Christmas travel ramps up, Columbia appears well-positioned for smooth conditions. Mild afternoons and dry roads should help keep holiday plans on track. Heading out early this morning or traveling later this week—how cool did it feel where you stepped outside?\nFive Day Outlook – Columbia, South Carolina\n- Today: Sunny. High near 59.\n- Sunday: Sunny and warmer. High near 64.\n- Monday: Sunny. High near 54.\n- Tuesday: Partly sunny and mild. High near 64.\n- Wednesday: Sunny. High near 69.",
