  "text": "Nebraska – A cool, dry breeze moves across south-central Nebraska this morning, nudging loose leaves along curbs and rattling bare branches. Temperatures sit in the 40s around Hastings, comfortable but brisk, with a winter edge still hanging in the air. Roads remain dry, yet the wind adds a bite for anyone heading out early.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, today stays partly sunny with highs near the mid-40s. Northwest winds gust at times, especially across open farmland and along Highway 281, before easing later. The dry air keeps visibility clear, and travel conditions remain favorable through the day.\nTonight cools into the mid-30s as skies stay partly cloudy. Sunday brings a noticeable improvement. Sunshine returns with highs pushing toward the upper 40s, and south winds begin a warming trend. Sunday night dips into the low 30s, cold enough for patchy frost on windshields and rooftops.\nBy Monday, the pattern shifts quickly. Highs surge near 60 under bright sun, a sharp contrast from the chilly mornings. This warm-up continues into Tuesday with mid-50s and light winds. No precipitation appears on the horizon, and there are no signs of snow, ice, or slick pavement.\nMeteorologists note the lack of moisture as a key factor. While winter storms target the Upper Midwest, Nebraska remains on the quieter side of the pattern. Even so, cold nights paired with mild afternoons can still create brief frost early, especially in low-lying areas.\nLooking ahead to Christmas travel, Hastings appears well positioned. Dry roads, improving temperatures, and clear skies support smooth driving on I-80 and regional highways. Morning chill lingers, but delays look unlikely. Traveling soon or staying close to home—how does the temperature swing feel where you are today?\nFive Day Outlook – Hastings, Nebraska\n- Today: Partly sunny and breezy. High near 44.\n- Sunday: Mostly sunny. High near 47.\n- Monday: Sunny and much warmer. High near 59.\n- Tuesday: Partly sunny. High near 55.\n- Wednesday: Mostly sunny and mild. High near 60.",
