  "text": "Seattle, WA — As of Saturday, December 20, forecasters are closely watching a developing weather pattern that could deliver unusually warm conditions across Washington in the days following Christmas, with near-record temperatures possible as 2026 gets underway.\nThe period from December 27 through January 2 is expected to feature a strong ridge of high pressure over the western United States. This setup typically suppresses colder air intrusions and promotes above-normal temperatures, particularly west of the Cascades. The Climate Prediction Center places much of Washington in a favored zone for warmer-than-average conditions during this window.\nIn Seattle, where average late-December highs hover in the mid-40s, daytime temperatures could push into the mid-50s and possibly approach 60 degrees on several days. If realized, that level of warmth would put some daily highs within range of long-standing records, especially during breaks in cloud cover or periods of offshore flow.\nWestern Washington communities, including the Puget Sound region and southwest lowlands, are likely to feel the biggest departure from normal. Snow levels in the Cascades may fluctuate higher than typical for late December, potentially impacting ski conditions and mountain snowpack. East of the Cascades, temperatures are also expected to trend above average, though overnight cooling may limit record potential there.\nLooking ahead, the January 3–16, 2026 outlook continues to favor above-normal temperatures for much of the Pacific Northwest, suggesting the mild pattern could persist into the first half of January. That raises the possibility of a delayed or shortened stretch of true winter cold.\nWhile the warmth may ease travel concerns around New Year’s, meteorologists caution that prolonged winter mildness can have longer-term implications for water resources and seasonal climate trends across Washington.",
