  "text": "After this week’s round of rain, Central Texas is heading into an extended stretch of dry weather lasting through the Christmas holiday. If you’re traveling across Texas, you shouldn’t face any weather-related slowdowns, as a strong system of high atmospheric pressure is expected to build over Texas and the southern Plains next week.\nThis high pressure setup is essentially a summer-style heat dome but happening in the wintertime. While we won’t see triple-digit heat, daily temperatures will be much warmer than normal and reach the upper 70s to near 80 degrees, which would run about 10 to 20 degrees above average for this time of year.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nThe forecast high of 80 degrees on Christmas Day would match the second-warmest Christmas on record, most recently set in 2016, and it would be the hottest holiday since 2021, when temperatures got as high as 79 degrees.\nSaturday Forecast\nCentral Texas will wake up to light southerly winds Saturday morning, with both dew point and air temperatures in the low 50s. As the two temperatures close in on each other, the air will become saturated with water vapor, allowing areas of dense fog to develop along and east of Interstate 35 through 10 a.m.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nWinds will increase to 10 to 20 mph, with gusts approaching 25 mph. This will help dissipate the fog, as clouds gradually decrease and mostly sunny skies develop by the afternoon. Temperatures will be unusually warm, with highs nearing the 80-degree mark in Austin.\nOutside of Central Texas, unseasonably warm temperatures will put record highs at more than 18 metro area weather stations, from Southern California to Texas.\nWant more Statesman?\nAdd Preferred Source\nSix of those records in jeopardy Saturday will be in the Lone Star State:\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\n- Lubbock: 80 degrees set in 1921\n- Midland: 79 degrees set in 2010\n- Dallas: 78 degrees set in 1978\n- Waco: 78 degrees set in 1978\n- Amarillo: 75 degrees set in 1894\n- El Paso: 74 degrees set in 1981\nRecord highs in Austin should stay intact. The Dec. 20 record high at Camp Mabry is 83 degrees, while Austin-Bergstrom International Airport’s record is 84 degrees — both set in 1951.\nSunday’s forecast and beyond\nAstronomical winter, which is marked by the winter solstice, will arrive at 9:03 a.m. Sunday in Austin, but it won’t feel like it at all with afternoon highs in the upper 60s and low 70s. The winter solstice is the moment when, as the Earth orbits the sun on a tilted axis, the planet’s Northern Hemisphere (where Texas is) is pointed the farthest away from the sun.\nAdvertisement\nArticle continues below this ad\nAnother dry cold front will move through Texas with little fanfare. Winds will shift, blowing out of the north, and temperatures will cool by about 5 to 10 degrees, despite plenty of sunshine in the afternoon.\nLooking ahead, temperatures well above average will remain the dominant trend. Highs in the 70s and 80s are expected to persist through the end of the year, with this unusual warmth lasting into the final week of December. According to the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center, Central Texas has a 90% chance of above-average temperatures during this period.",
