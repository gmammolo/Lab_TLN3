  "text": "Salt Lake City, UT — Utah is on track for an unusually warm finish to 2025 and a mild start to 2026, with long-range forecasts pointing to near-record temperatures across much of the state during the period from December 27 through January 2. As of Saturday, December 20, winter’s coldest air masses appear set to remain north of the region.\nThe latest outlooks from the NOAA Climate Prediction Center place Utah within a broad zone of above-normal temperatures, driven by a persistent ridge of high pressure across the western and central United States. This pattern favors limited storm activity and suppresses intrusions of Arctic air into the Great Basin.\nIn Salt Lake City, where late-December highs typically average in the low 40s, temperatures could rise into the upper 40s and 50s, with some days approaching record territory if sunshine dominates. Overnight lows are also expected to remain warmer than normal, reducing the frequency of hard freezes along the Wasatch Front.\nThe warmth may be felt statewide. Southern Utah could experience particularly mild conditions, while even higher elevations trend warmer than seasonal averages. That raises concerns for snowpack development, especially for ski resorts that rely on consistent cold and snowfall during late December.\nLooking ahead beyond New Year’s Day, the January 3–16, 2026 temperature outlook continues to favor above-normal temperatures across Utah, suggesting the mild pattern could persist into mid-January before a more traditional winter regime returns.\nWhile the warmer weather may ease holiday travel and reduce heating demand, it also underscores a broader trend toward delayed winter cold as Utah enters 2026, with implications for water supply and long-term drought conditions later in the year.",
