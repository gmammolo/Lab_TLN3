  "text": "Happy Saturday! After a colder Friday, our weekend will start with us back in the 50s under a mostly sunny sky. By the evening, a weak cold front will pass through, bringing our temperatures down to the lower 30s. Sunday will be a bit colder as we feel the effects of the cold front, with highs staying in the mid-40s. By the workweek, we will warm back up to the 50s, where we will stay for most of the week. Christmas looks to be a warm one, with highs in the 60s and a chance of a few showers.\nActions\nA warm and sunny Saturday\nHighs to reach the lower 50s\nPosted\nCopyright 2025 Scripps Media, Inc.
