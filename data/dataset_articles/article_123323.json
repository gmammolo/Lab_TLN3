  "text": "SATURDAY FORECAST: Record warmth possible as temperatures soar above normal\nLAS VEGAS (KSNV) — High pressure moving eastward this weekend is expected to bring some clouds, but temperatures will remain significantly above normal, ranging from eight to 12 degrees higher than usual for this time of year.\nAs Christmas week approaches, high pressure will continue to move east into the central U.S., leading to a pattern shift by midweek.\nWhile uncertainties remain regarding the timing of next week's storm system, long-range models suggest a significant amount of moisture could impact the southwest.\nBE THE FIRST TO COMMENT\nSaturday's forecast predicts mostly sunny and warm conditions with a high near 67 degrees, while Saturday night will be partly cloudy and mild with a low near 50 degrees.",
