  "text": "It could have been a lot worse.\nThat’s the response from nearly everyone about the storm that hit Central Montana last week with hurricane-force winds. While communities around the state saw downed trees and large semi-trucks flipped over, Fergus County mainly dealt with power outages.\nAccording to the Meteorologist Austin McDowell at the National Weather Service in Great Falls, Fergus County’s highest wind gust was 94 miles per hour on Judith Peak. The Grass Range area recorded a gust of 87 mph at Beacon Hill, while Lewistown’s highest gust was 76 mph at the airport.\nIn nearby counties it was much the same, with gusts clocked at 81 mph in Geyser and 84 mph at Judith Gap.\n“As serious as it could have been, we lucked out,” said Fergus County Disaster and Emergency Services Coordinator Steve Fanning. “The Snowies protected us. We had a few reports of trees or lines down, about 20 calls for service, but nothing severe.”\nFanning said first responders and road crews were prepared to go into emergency mode but the storm did not require that level of response.\nHowever there were reports of semi trucks flipped over by the wind in Wheatland and Judith Basin counties Fanning said, and the highway from Eddies Corner to Judith Gap was closed briefly.\nThe strength and duration of the storm had meteorologists watching it as the system raced across Washington and Idaho into Montana.\n“With gusts at the higher end of what we usually see with wind events and sustained for hours and hours, we were sending out warnings well ahead of the storm,” McDowell said. “We were keeping track as the gusts marched eastward. Then a cold front out of Canada resulted in that bit of snow in Fergus County. The strong upper level system and the cold front mixing winds to the surface all added up to an unusual event.”\nThat small amount of snow brought December’s precipitation total in Lewistown to 1.01 inches from Dec. 1 to Dec. 17, compared with the normal of .26 inches.\nMcDowell said Central Montana can expect an \"active\" weather pattern over the next week or so but, “nothing we see is screaming high wind.”\nOn Thursday Governor Greg Gianforte issued an executive order declaring a wind disaster in Montana, citing damaging winds, especially in Ravalli, Wheatland, Mineral and Flathead counties.\nThe Governor said the Montana DES State Emergency Coordination Center was activated and staff was expecting to receive declarations of emergencies from additional local and tribal jurisdictions as damage reports roll in.\nLet the news come to you\nGet our free email newsletters — latest headlines and e-edition notifications.",
