  "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. ( WBRC ) - TODAY : We’re starting the weekend on a quiet and pleasant note.\nWhile it is cold this morning (in the low 30s to upper 20s) Expect sunshine for much of the day with just a few passing clouds at times.\nTemperatures will rebound nicely this afternoon, topping out near 61, perfect winter weather for Christmas shoppers today.\nIt should feel comfortable compared to recent days, making it a great day to be outside.\nFirst Alert Weather: Morning update, 12-20-25 (WBRC) THE NEXT 24 HOURS : Clouds will gradually increase tonight as moisture begins to move north. By very early Sunday morning, scattered showers are expected to develop across parts of central Alabama.\nRain looks most likely during the morning and beginning to taper off into early afternoon, with activity coming in waves of sprinkles rather than a steady rain. Sunday afternoon should trend drier from north to south, with clearing skies. Highs Sunday should reach close to 58, with lows Sunday night settling near 45.\nFirst Alert Weather: Morning update, 12-20-25 (WBRC) MONDAY AND TUESDAY : Monday looks milder, with clouds giving way to some breaks of sun and highs around 60, especially later in the day.\nMonday morning will likely start out mostly clear, with clouds developing during the day. Look for a few sprinkles to move in to our northwestern counties late Monday evening. Lows Monday night will likely bottom out close to 43 degrees.\nTuesday looks to be cloudy all day with either sprinkles here and there or a misty rain. Temps should be warming up well above average—close to 68 by the afternoon.\nFirst Alert Weather: Morning update, 12-20-25 (WBRC) CHRISTMAS EVE THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK : A noticeably warmer pattern sets up heading into the remainder of Christmas week.\nTemperatures climb steadily with generally quiet weather expected. Highs should reach near 71 on Christmas Eve and around 72 on Christmas Day. The warm weather is expected to continue into Friday with highs again near 72.\nFirst Alert Weather: Morning update, 12-20-25 (WBRC) These readings are well above normal for late December, and while we’ll keep an eye on a few weak disturbances nearby, the overall trend points toward a warm, mostly dry, and very mild stretch of weather through the end of the week.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2025 WBRC.
