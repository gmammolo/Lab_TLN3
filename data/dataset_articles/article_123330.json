  "text": "North Carolina — Cold air clings to docks and marsh grass as sunrise breaks over the Cape Fear River. Breath hangs briefly, then fades as sunshine strengthens. It feels like winter early, but change arrives quickly.\nTemperatures climb steadily today, reaching the mid-50s by afternoon. Skies stay clear, and winds remain light. Travel stays smooth on U.S. 17 and I-40, with no rain or fog concerns.\nTonight turns crisp again. Lows dip near 39 degrees, especially inland. Bridges and shaded roads cool fast, though surfaces remain dry. A light jacket will be needed late.\nSunday brings a noticeable warm-up. Sunshine dominates, and highs rise into the low 60s by afternoon. It will feel more like late fall than winter. Outdoor plans stay comfortable, and beach walks feel inviting.\nSunday night cools quickly. Lows settle near the mid-30s, close enough for patchy frost inland. Coastal areas stay slightly warmer, but cars may need a scrape away from the water.\nMonday continues the dry stretch. Sunshine pushes highs near 52 degrees with a light northeast breeze. Conditions stay stable, and travel remains quiet across southeastern North Carolina.\nBy Tuesday and Wednesday, warmth builds further. Highs reach the mid-60s, and nights stay above freezing. Meteorologists note this as an early winter tease, not a true cold snap.\nLooking ahead to Christmas travel, Wilmington sits in a favorable weather window. No rain, no snow, and no freeze-related travel disruptions appear through midweek. Drivers returning home should still watch for chilly mornings and quick temperature drops after sunset.\nWinter waits nearby, but for now, December stays cooperative.
