  "text": "We are certainly on track for a good old-fashioned Minnesota Christmas! This winter feels much more like the Minnesota winters many of us grew up with.\nSnowmobilers, skiers and those who love to ice fish are no doubt excited by the winter weather we have been receiving and all that it brings in the months ahead.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAt the same time, winter weather can sometimes cause disruptions to schedules, and as such, I want to walk our community through the strategy and rationale behind our storm day plans.\nMinnesota requires school districts to meet a minimum threshold for days of instruction, generally equivalent to 165 days. Our current calendar includes 172 instructional days.\nLike most districts, Bemidji Area Schools intentionally schedules more than the minimum number of required days because we believe this supports stronger instructional outcomes for students. The district does not receive additional funding for days beyond the minimum; this decision is driven by what we believe is best for student learning.\nOn Nov. 26, we used our first storm day, which will be made up on Jan. 19, 2026. The school calendar has for many years included two built-in make-up days to account for early winter storms: Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents’ Day. These days are used for storms occurring prior to early February. For storms later in the winter, we utilize e-learning days in an effort to keep the last day of school consistent with the published calendar.\nBefore the availability of e-learning days, storms occurring after Presidents’ Day were typically made up at the end of the school year. With the addition of e-learning, we are now able to avoid extending the school year in most cases. State statute, however, limits districts to a maximum of five e-learning days per year.\nFrom an instructional standpoint, we believe that make-up days scheduled during the school year are more effective for students than e-learning days or days added at the end of the year.\nWe also believe that e-learning provides better instructional outcomes than extending the calendar further into June. Additionally, we recognize that families and the community value keeping the end-of-year schedule consistent with the originally published calendar whenever possible.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOur mission at Bemidji Area Schools is to empower students to reach their fullest potential. To do so, we must prioritize high-quality instruction. Our approach to storm days reflects that commitment: we use make-up days first, e-learning days second, and only as a last resort add days to the end of the school year.\nSo bundle up, make some hot chocolate, and let’s enjoy the winter weather! As always, thank you for your support of Bemidji Area Schools!\nJeremy Olson is the superintendent of Bemidji Area Schools.
