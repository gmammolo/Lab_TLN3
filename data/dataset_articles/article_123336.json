  "text": "“A Christmas Miracle” As Some Snowfall Arrives in North American West\nSki areas along North America’s Pacific Coast are tentatively celebrating the arrival of the first of a series of storm systems that will hopefully transform their fortunes after what has now become one of the worst season starts in recent years for many.\nSki areas along North America’s Pacific Coast are tentatively celebrating the arrival of the first of a series of storm systems that will hopefully transform their fortunes after what has now become one of the worst season starts in recent years for many.\nConditions have been predominantly been warm, wet and windy or dry over the past few months with several false dawns when hoped for snowfall has arrived as sleet or rain.\nNow through a series of Pacific storms and colder temperatures, at least in the Pacific Northwest, has brought hope that the season can finally get started at many still-closed resorts whilst others that have managed to open will be able to open more for Christmas week.\nThere are still doubts as to how much snow will arrive, whether some will again see rain and sleet and also the impact of accompanying gale force winds.\nNorth America’s largest ski area, Whistler Blackcomb, is one of those that has suffered with very limited terrain open on their upper mountain leading to nightmare lift queues shown on social media posts from skiers in resort. No though, it looks like things are finally improving and the resort reports its up to about a third of its runs open, on the upper mountain.\n“It’s a Christmas miracle! We’ve had nearly 54cm of fresh snow this past week, and the energy on the mountain has been incredible - we love seeing all of you enjoy ULLR’s bounty! Whistler during the festive season deserves to be covered in the fluffy white stuff, and this season is ready to deliver. The taps are still on with more snow hitting our mid-mountain terrain - around 20cm is expected tomorrow, more than 30cm on Sunday, and even more in store next week,” a social media post from the resort on Friday enthused.\nCrystal Mountain is amongst resorts starting their seasons this weekend, noting initial terrain will be limited. Fellow Washington State ski area Mt Baker, which holds the world record for the most snowfall in a season from 25 years ago, says its ready to open but its access road is closed due to previous storm damage and concerns over weather extremes over the next few days.",
