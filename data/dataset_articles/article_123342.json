  "text": "Good Thursday morning! It is a much warmer and more humid start to the day with lows in the 70s. This afternoon, expect a mix of sun and clouds with the chance for a random shower or two. The rip current risk remains high as southeast winds (sustained at 10 to 15 mph, gusts to 20 mph) rule the day. Temperatures are forecast to reach the low 80s. Have a great day.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
