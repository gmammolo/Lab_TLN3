  "text": "FORECAST: Saturday’s gusty winds bring a nice warmup\nWEATHER HEADLINES\n- NEXT 12: Southerly wind gusts up to 30 MPH push highs into the 50s today\n- SHORT TERM: Dry cold front cools us back down Sunday\n- LONG TERM: Feeling like Spring Christmas week with mild temperatures and showers at times\nFORECAST\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE)- Saturday is another windy day with gusts up to 30 MPH at times and a mix of sun and clouds. Winds will be out of the south today, which will bring in warmer air that boosts our high temperatures into the 50s this afternoon.\nA cold front passing through the region Saturday night won’t bring any rain or snow but an increase in clouds and a drop in temperatures. We’ll fall back into the upper 20s and low 30s Sunday morning.\nClouds from the early morning cold front will hang around through midday before sunshine takes control into the afternoon hours. It will be a cooler Sunday with highs in the 40s. Mostly clear to partly cloudy skies Sunday night. Lows fall into the 20s once again.\nWe’ll see shower chances return by Monday evening as a warm front slowly pushes in from the south. Showers linger for much of the day on Tuesday and into Christmas Eve.\nA Spring-like Christmas is in store this year with highs well into the 60s and gusty winds at times. Any shower chances currently look to be highest early Christmas Day before a drier afternoon and evening.\nCopyright 2025 WAVE. All rights reserved.",
