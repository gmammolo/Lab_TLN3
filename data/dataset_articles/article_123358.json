  "text": "East Texas (KLTV/KTRE) - Happy Saturday, East Texas! Today will be a warm and breezy day with high temperatures in the middle 70s and southwest winds gusting up to 25-30 mph. A few more clouds roll in overnight as a cold front moves into the area, bringing slightly cooler temperatures for the second half of the weekend along with a slight chance for rain. Light rain/drizzle will be possible on and off through the day on both Sunday and Monday, then dry conditions settle in through the remainder of the holiday week. Temperatures quickly rebound into the 70s by Monday, and will remain above normal through the Christmas holiday. High temperatures will reach the upper 70s both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Have a great day!\nCopyright 2025 KLTV. All rights reserved.",
