  "text": "Happy Saturday, everyone!\nTemperatures will continue to warm up this weekend and especially as we head closer to Christmas Day.\nThe high today will be 61 with bright and sunny skies. Wind gusts up to 25 mph are possible along with sustained winds up to 15 mph. This same wind pattern is expected to last during the daytime between now and Tuesday.\nIt will be chilly this evening at 40 with mostly clear skies.\nSunday is the official first day of winter, but it will not feel like it during the daytime at least. It will be mostly cloudy with a high of 58 and a low of 34. There is a slim chance for a light rain shower in the early-morning hours.\nTemperature highs will warm up to 69 on Christmas Eve and 72 on Christmas Day! More rain showers are expected Tuesday and Wednesday.\nWe will continue to keep everyone updated with the latest forecast. Thank you, and enjoy the warmer weather this weekend!",
