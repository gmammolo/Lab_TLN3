  "text": "First Alert: A nice warmup through today along with lots of sunshine and less wind\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - We’ll enjoy lots of sunshine this weekend with temperatures warming to above average.\nFirst Alert Headlines\n- Sunny this weekend with less wind.\n- First day of winter will be warmer than usual.\n- Temperatures ramp up even more in time for the holidays.\nFirst Alert Summary\nMorning temperatures in the 30s will warm nicely through the day thanks to plenty of sunshine and high pressure in control of our pattern. While you may need a coat first thing this morning, a light jacket or sweater may be more comfortable later this afternoon.\nSunday, the first day of winter, will be slightly warmer with highs peaking in the middle to upper 60s. The winter solstice officially occurs at 10:03 AM.\nA front will drop through the area late Sunday. However, it is expected to be a dry front with no chance for rain forecast at this time. A modest drop in temperatures is expected behind the front. This will put us closer to average for this time of year, albeit briefly.\nWe’ll see temperatures ramp up through much of next week, reaching 70s in time for Christmas!\nFirst Alert Forecast:\nToday: Plenty of sunshine. Highs near 60 degrees.\nSunday: Mostly sunny. Highs in the middle to upper 60s.\nMonday: Mostly sunny and a tad cooler. Highs in the middle 50s.\nTuesday: Partly cloudy. Highs in the lower 60s.\nChristmas Eve (Wednesday): Mostly sunny. Highs in the upper 60s.\nFeel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.
