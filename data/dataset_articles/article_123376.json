  "text": "Florida's 5 Best Destinations With Cooler Temperatures\nFlorida didn't earn the nickname \"The Sunshine State\" for nothing. On average, it sees between 230 and 250 days of sunshine each year. Though year-round sunny warmth is what the region is famous for, there are pockets of Florida that offer milder temperatures. These spots range from tranquil coastal escapes to small inland towns surrounded by pine forests. While it's highly unlikely you'll need to pull out your winter coat and hat in these cities, they're perfect for those who want to experience Florida without the blazing heat.\nAcross the state, the annual average temperature is 71 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest average temperatures are found in the south, while the lowest occur along the northeast coast and Panhandle. By comparing climates across various cities, we arrived at the five best destinations in Florida for cooler temperatures (i.e. those below the state's average). All of these spots are along the Panhandle to the north with proximity to the Gulf of Mexico's winds which help curb the heat. While sharing comfortable conditions, each area boasts its own unique appeal and offers a refreshing twist on a classic Florida getaway.\nAfter all, one of the state's biggest draws is that there's so much to do. Whether you want to shop until your feet hurt, adventure into the sprawling natural world, or lay back and sip a drink by the beach, there's something for everyone. Find your ideal vacation destination with this roundup of Florida towns where you can beat the heat. From the coastal getaway nicknamed the \"Seafood Capital Of The South\" to the rustic charm and natural appeal of Niceville, these cities offer something different.\nPanama City Beach\nNot far from a clear-water natural spring perfect for swimming, Panama City Beach boasts some of the coolest weather in Florida. While this coastal city is the warmest entry on our list, it has an average annual temperature of just 69 degrees . In the summertime, the sea breeze provides some of the lowest temperatures in the state (82 degrees in July). This extends to winter months as well, reaching an average of 54 degrees in January.\nWith such an inviting climate, Panama City Beach is an excellent vacation option year-round. Nearby attractions like Camp Helen State Park provide access to waterways such as Powell Lake, Florida's largest coastal dune lake. Spanning 180 acres, the state park has a quiet white sand beach that has the vibe of 'Old Florida.' Other local landmarks to explore include Shell Island, a 7-mile barrier island where you can catch glimpses of dolphins in the water. For access to beaches and shops, head to Pier Park, the heart of Panama City Beach. Just steps away from the shore and home to over 120 stores and restaurants, this is the perfect place to spend time with friends and family.\nSpeaking of restaurants, this city features plenty of mouthwatering spots worthy of a foodie's bucket list. For Southern food and panoramic views of the Gulf, try the laid-back Barefoot on the Beach Bar & Grill, where shirts and shoes are not required for service. For a fine dining experience, visit The Grand Marlin Restaurant & Oyster Bar. Its outdoor bar overlooks Grand Lagoon so you can appreciate stunning views as you dine.\nTallahassee\nAs Florida's capital city, Tallahassee stands apart from the rest of the Sunshine State not just in terms of climate. Nestled in the rolling hills of the Panhandle (not far from this Gulf Coast route full of beaches, forgotten villages, and forests), this metro area enjoys some of Florida's coolest weather, with the average annual temperature sitting at 67 degrees. In fact, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Tallahassee averages 28 days of freezing temperatures annually, more than any other Florida city mentioned. The spring months offer comfortable temperatures in comparison to other popular Floridian destinations, making it a great place to visit to enjoy milder weather and fewer crowds.\nWhile having the amenities of a big city, this region manages to retain a small-town feel. It's also a great destination for history and culture buffs. Downtown Tallahassee is where you can find the Florida Supreme Court across from the Florida State Capitol building and the Florida Historic Capitol Museum, which dates back to 1845. Approximately 6 miles away is the Tallahassee Museum which boasts 52 acres of native Floridian plants and wildlife species. From wildlife displays to historic exhibits, this attraction allows visitors to explore nature in whatever way they see fit. Another must-see spot is Alfred B. Maclay Gardens State Park. Filled with stunning decorative gardens first established in 1923, the park features trails for walking, biking, hiking, and horseback riding through the beautiful foliage.\nDespite Florida's reputation for white sand beaches, its inland capital doesn't have any beaches (per Choose Tallahassee). Don't worry, several beaches — including Wakulla Beach along the Forgotten Coast — are within driving distance.\nPensacola\nAlong the Gulf Coast is Pensacola, often considered the \"coldest\" city in Florida. It has an average annual temperature of 67 degrees, and while that is low in comparison to much of Florida, there are a couple of places that have it beat. Still, Pensacola's climate is significantly cooler than more southern cities like Miami (the trendy beach paradise full of nightlife, coastal hotels, and tasty eats), which averages 77 degrees year-round.\nThe milder weather is not all this city has to offer. Whether you love exploring the outdoors, learning about history, or viewing beautiful art, Pensacola is the perfect place for people who don't want to be bored for a second. If a day surrounded by water sounds good, head to the white sands of Pensacola Beach or Perido Key for some family-friendly fun where you can fish, sail, and swim to your heart's desire. If the arts and culture scene is more your thing, the Pensacola Museum of Art and the historic Saenger Theatre can both be found downtown. There's also no shortage of shopping options; from eclectic antique shops to classy boutiques to a large shopping center with specialty shops, you'll need to be sure you leave enough room in your suitcase to bring it all home. Pensacola can be accessed easily, as Pensacola International Airport is less than 10 miles away.\nNiceville\nNiceville is a charming town that lives up to its name. Situated along Florida's Choctawhatchee Bay and having an average annual temperature of 65 degrees, it has one of the more temperate climates in the state. Even the warmer months are considerably lower than the rest of Florida. In June, Niceville sees an average daily temperature of 79 degrees. Compare that to Miami, which sees an average of 83 degrees.\nNiceville has a tranquil appeal that makes it ideal for people who love the outdoors. The Turkey Creek Nature Trail and Pavilion is a great spot for relaxing and seeing wildlife. Whether you're there to canoe in the creek or take a stroll on the boardwalk, the natural beauty will encourage you to slow down and take it all in. Nature lovers should also take a trip to the nearby Fred Gannon Rocky Bayou State Park, a former World War II gunnery range that spans 357 acres and offers plenty of recreational activities such as camping, fishing, or hiking. This park features beautiful longleaf pine trees, some of which are over 300 years old. Niceville is easily accessible from Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport which is just 5 miles away.\nCentury\nSituated near the Alabama border, Century is the northernmost city on this list and also the coolest with an average annual temperature of 65 degrees. Century has some of the lowest temperatures during the winter months, with January having an average daily temperature of 49 degrees. While most of Florida experiences the higher summer temperatures, Century's hottest month, August, has an average daily temperature of 81 degrees.\nCentury offers a small-town getaway from the hustle and bustle that other major Florida cities are known for. It has a population of only 1,700 residents and is considered a great starting point for exploring the state. Once a booming mill town, this historic city has plenty of buildings that have stood for over 100 years, showcasing the residents' pride in their community. Visit the Alger-Sullivan Historic District downtown to learn about the community through the three museums in this area, The Leach House Museum, Boxcar Museum, and Post Office Museum.\nShowalter Park is a great option for families as it contains a splash pad and playground as well as several sports fields that are perfect for children to play and exercise. This park is a hub for community activity as well, offering a place to socialize, relax, exercise, or just take in the sights of nature. You can find even more outdoor activities at the nearby Lake Stone Campground. Spanning 100 acres, this campground has everything you need for a successful camping trip, from showers to playgrounds to a fishing pier. The nearest airport to Century is Pensacola International Airport which is an hour away.\nMethodology\nAll five cities listed were chosen because they each have monthly average temperatures that fall toward the lower end of the state's average. By comparing climate data from databases such as WorldClimate, which draws its information from The Global Historical Climate Network, we were able to narrow down our search and find the coolest cities in the state. From there, we selected cities that not only offer calmer temperatures but also showcase the fun and relaxation that visitors are drawn to Florida for.\nWe wanted to make sure that each city had its own unique appeal while still feeling like a Floridian getaway. That means that while there were cooler cities that could have been selected, the lack of attractions or access to activities prevented us from including them on this list. For example, the city of Fountain has an average annual temperature of 66 degrees Fahrenheit which would make it one of the coldest locations on the list, but the lack of local tourist attractions kept it off the final list. Additionally, while we could have selected five similar cities located directly beside each other which experience the same climate, it was important that each city felt different to highlight the diversity in experience one can have in the Sunshine State.",
