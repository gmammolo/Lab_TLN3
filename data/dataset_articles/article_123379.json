  "text": "By Brian Thomas ,\n1 hours ago\nWe started out rather chilly with 20s and 30s across the area this morning, but we’ll see things warm up nicely under lots of sunshine. Highs today will be in the mid 60s. Sunday, a weak front swings down from the north and that will provide is with some clouds and a stray shower could be possible, but we aren’t expect much, if any, rain out of this system. Highs on Sunday will be in the mid 60s again.\nCHRISTMAS WEEK:\nBehind that Sunday front, we see some slightly cooler temps on Monday with afternoon highs in the low 60s under partly cloudy skies. Tuesday, we really start to see things warm up as we head toward the 70s. Expect low 70s on Tuesday, with mid 70s Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and through the upcoming weekend, we should remain in the 70s. Highs may be approaching 15 degrees above average for this time of the year, but we won’t be warm enough to break any records. The record high for Christmas Eve is 79, set in 1984, and for Christmas Day, the record high is 81, set in 2015.\nNEXT WEEKEND:\nSaturday should remain dry with partly cloudy skeis and afternoon highs in the low to mid 70s. Sunday, looks dry early with a very small chance for a shower late. Highs will be in the low to mid 70s.\nThanks for watching WRBL News 3 and have a great Saturday! – Meteorologist Brian Thomas\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
