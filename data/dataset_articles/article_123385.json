  "text": "SRINAGAR: The upper reaches of Kashmir Valley on Saturday witnessed the season’s fresh snowfall as flakes began falling over Sonamarg, Zojila, Drass and Razdhan Top, marking the first significant spell of Chillai Kalan. The Bandipora Gurez road has already been closed after snowfall along the Razdhan belt.\nOfficials said it has been snowing in higher reaches, leading to slippery stretches and a drop in temperature across surrounding areas.\nDeputy Commissioner Bandipora Indu Kanwal Chib urged people to take precautions during the harsh winter phase, advising the public to handle electric and heating appliances carefully and avoid overloading to prevent fire incidents. She said the administration is fully geared to respond to weather related challenges and stressed the need for safe use of heating devices during the peak winter period.\nWeather forecasts indicate that several higher reaches may witness further accumulation over the next forty eight hours. According to early assessments, Razdan Top and Sadhna Top may receive up to two feet of snow, while Zojila, Sinthan, Margan and Peer ki Gali are expected to record moderate accumulation. Light to moderate snowfall is also likely in destinations such as Sonamarg, Gulmarg, Doodhpathri and Pahalgam.\nAuthorities said field teams are monitoring the situation and road clearance operations will be initiated once the snowfall stabilizes.
