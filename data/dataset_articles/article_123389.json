  "text": "Bakersfield enjoys first \"above average\" temperature as temps hits 62 after chilly month\nBAKERSFIELD, Calif. (KBAK/KBFX) — Big changes came in this week as we FINALLY broke out of the Tule and, amazingly, into the 60s! Thursday scored a high of 62 in Bakersfield bringing the first \"above average\" day in almost a month!\nThis weekend the weather looks relatively quiet in these parts, but the chances of rain will continue across northern California as a plume of moisture heads in from the Pacific. The story for Kern County will be mild to locally somewhat warm (for instance across the desert) and breezy east of the Valley. Varying amount of clouds will start moving into our skies as the weather pattern shifts from the quiet one of the previous month to an active one for the upcoming week.\nBE THE FIRST TO COMMENT\nHave a great weekend!",
