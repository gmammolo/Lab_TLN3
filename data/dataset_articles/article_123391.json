  "text": "By Brandon Lawson ,\n3 hours ago\n( PINPOINT WEATHER ) — Good Saturday morning and welcome to the weekend! We have a gorgeous weekend ahead, with plenty of sunshine and pleasant temperatures. We are much colder this morning compared to yesterday morning; most of the region is in the lower 30s.\nHowever, the cold start this morning will be followed by a seasonable afternoon of 50s for high temperatures. There will be less wind today, which will add to the comfort.\nTemperatures will drop back into the low to mid 30s tonight, with mostly clear skies. We will track a dry cold front passage on Sunday morning, but that will not hurt our temperatures. We will likely be slightly warmer for Sunday afternoon, with high temperatures in the mid to upper 50s and possibly near 60 degrees for some spots.\nThe mountains will be in the mid to upper 40s for both Saturday and Sunday.\nNext week continues to trend warmer. We will be on the chillier side to start the week on Monday, with high temperatures in the upper 40s and lower 50s. However, high temperatures will push into the 60s by Tuesday, with mid to upper 60s by Christmas Eve and Christmas Day! This is a warm pattern that will continue into the New Year.\nThe only rain chance over the next week appears to be a few spotty showers on Tuesday, as a weak cold front moves through.\nDownload the Pinpoint Weather app today!\niPhone and iPad users, CLICK HERE.\nAndroid users, CLICK HERE .\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
