  "text": "The Village Lift opened today. This photo was taken this morning just above Garden Path near the top. It shows Sterling Mountain, the notch, and Mount Mansfield. I love how mountains change from different points of view. Currently, it is 8 degrees at the summit of Sterling with sunshine and winds of 10 to 20 mph. We have 4 lifts operating: Village, Sterling, Mogul Mouse’s Magic, and Sir Henry’s Slider. We have 26 trails open with terrain for all ability levels. Snowmaking has resumed on Lower Chilcoot and Mulcahy’s Link.",
