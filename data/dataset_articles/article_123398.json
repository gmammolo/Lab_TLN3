  "text": "An absolutely beautiful weekend is in store for the Tennessee Valley, with even warmer temperatures expected for the holiday.\nToday is the perfect day for any outdoor activities you may have, with highs warming into the low 60s under mostly sunny skies. Cloud cover will build after the dinnertime hours, and isolated light showers are expected overnight, but conditions will trend drier as we wake up on Sunday. Highs tomorrow will be slightly cooler, in the upper 50s.\nSmall chances for rain remain in the forecast to kick off the holiday week, but the main story will be the warm temperatures. Highs will start in the upper 50s on Monday and gradually warm into the low 70s by Christmas. Overnight lows will be mild, in the mid-50s.\nSATURDAY: Sunny, mild. Breezy. Highs in the lower 60s. Wind: S 10-15 mph, gusts 20 mph.\nTONIGHT: Isolated showers, lows in the mid 40s. Wind: SSE 5 mph, gusts 15 mph.",
