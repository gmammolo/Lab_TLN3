  "text": "By Ken Grabowski ,\n1 hours ago Ken Grabowski (File photo) There was a time years ago when people used to refer to our beautiful northern Michigan area as “the four seasons playground.”\nAbout a decade ago, things began to change and we became more of a “three seasons and a ‘blah’ time of the year playground.” Spring, summer and fall remained the same, but the good old-fashioned winters were replaced with a “blah” season including a week of cold and snow followed by a week of 45- to 50-degree temperatures with rain melting it all away.\nPeople’s opinions on the “blah” season pretty much followed the patterns displayed on any subject matter in today’s world, as about 50% hated it and 50% loved it. It just goes to show you one person’s ecstasy is another one’s agony.\nTo winter activity enthusiasts, the early old-fashioned snow and cold weather is like a fluffy white gift from God. On the other side of the aisle, the other half say it feels like a plague and pestilence sent down from the heavens.\nThe winter of 2025-26 got off to an early start this year when \"Old Man Winter” made a noticeable appearance, checking in to set up residence in Manistee County before Thanksgiving. It boosted the spirits of the 50 percent winter lovers praying for an old-fashioned season, prompting plans for the upcoming months to begin dancing in their heads.\nSki enthusiasts had visions of natural powder lining the slopes in the coming months instead of man-made snow. The Old Man’s early arrival even made ski resort owners begin to ponder if this was the first year in many when the ski business would bring in much more revenue than their spring, summer and fall golf operations.\nIce fishermen were sporting big grins as they began getting their shanties ready to “hit the ice,” which many times in past years didn’t even exist. They also started putting their other fishing gear in the trunks of their cars and truck beds.\nIn the past decade, ice fishing was scarce in some Manistee County areas, with ice so thin a 150-pound person might be pushing their luck to venture out on it. Those were far from the conditions many of us recall years ago in the old-fashioned winters, when quad runners, snowmobiles and, believe it or not, cars and trucks took fishermen out to the doors of their shanties.\nThere probably are even a few people who still own snowmobiles who have visions dancing in their heads of doing some sledding within beautiful Manistee County for the first time in a couple of years. That would be more welcome to them than traveling 250 miles to find any noticeable snow in the Upper Peninsula.\nEven kids were giving a little wink of approval to the return of the Old Man. Over the past few years, skating and sledding opportunities were so few and far between you could count them on one hand some years.\nIt has been a while since we have experienced an old-fashioned winter like those many older residents remember from the days of their youth. So right now it’s taking a period of adjustment for some of the younger folks to get used to it.\nOne area in particular is our attire, as stocking hats, gloves, boots, long underwear and hooded jackets are traditionally needed to greet the Old Man. However, on the other side of the 50 percenters, we have witnessed after the last few milder winters more tennis shoes, lightweight jackets, an occasional pair of shorts and baseball hats this time of year.\nOne group I like to refer to as the 7:55 a.m.-ers are having an especially hard time adjusting to the return of the Old Man. They are the people who in the past few years were using the same pattern as spring, summer and fall — sleeping in, grabbing a quick shower, tossing on some lightweight clothes and heading out to be at work by 8 a.m.\nHowever, this year they are walking out the door into 3 to 4 inches of new snow going over the tops of their loafers. They also have a coffee in one hand and a muffin or Pop-Tart in the other, leaving no room to use their snow brush — if they can even find it — to clean off the car.\nAdding to their problems are snow-covered roads, so in their haste to get to work in five minutes they slide through intersections or bounce off a snowbank or two.\nMy snowblower is also feeling the challenge of the wrath of the Old Man, as the past few years I believe the groundhog came out more times than the blower did over the course of winter. After calling on its services four straight days, I swear it mumbled to me when I opened the garage on the fifth day, “What, you again?”\nAnother area where adaptation is needed with the return of the Old Man is checking the weather reports again. Over the last few years, if you wanted to go out of town for any reason, it was just a matter of hopping in the car and going.\nNow most of us are seeing blue and purple. No, I am not talking about seeing colors due to anger — those are the ones on the weather forecasters’ maps indicating snow and cold temperatures heading our way.\nSo regardless of whether you are a member of the agony or ecstasy group, hang in there and I will see you again on Monday.\nKen Grabowski is a retired journalist who spent more than 36 years in the newspaper business.",
