  "text": "By Daniel McFarland ,\n4 hours ago Temperatures were chilly early Saturday morning in central Florida as a cold front moved through the area. However, temperatures are expected to warm this week, with highs reaching the upper 70s until Friday.\nThe cold front led to some areas seeing morning lows in the upper 40s and low 50s on Saturday. As the week continues, morning lows will start near 60 degrees from Sunday onward, establishing stable conditions throughout the region.\nA weak cold front will move through central Florida on Monday, expected to have little effect on temperatures and continue the warm trend seen earlier this week.\nHowever, stronger winds are forecast for Monday afternoon, with gusts ranging from 25 to 35 mph.\nPrecipitation is expected to be minimal, with isolated coastal showers possible from Monday through Christmas Day. No substantial rain is anticipated to disrupt outdoor activities, suggesting mostly dry weather despite a slight chance of scattered showers.\nThe upcoming week is expected to have stable weather, with temperatures above average and only minor disruptions from a weak cold front and isolated showers.\nClick here to download our free news, weather and smart TV apps.
