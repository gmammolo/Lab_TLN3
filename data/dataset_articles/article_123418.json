  "text": "Srinagar, Dec 20: Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said that the much-anticipated snowfall in Kashmir was expected to significantly reduce pollution levels that have affected the Valley in recent weeks, while also marking the beginning of the winter tourist season.\nSpeaking to reporters here after reviewing snowfall preparedness, CM Omar said the government and people alike had been waiting anxiously for snow.\n“We have been waiting for this snow with great impatience. This will make the air a little cleaner. The pollution that we saw will stop. And the winter tourist season will begin,” he said.\nThe CM said that the administration has completed preparations for the expected snowfall across both the Kashmir and the mountainous areas of the Jammu division.\nHe said he personally reviewed the arrangements after arriving in Srinagar and chairing meetings with officials.\n“I myself came to Srinagar and took a meeting. The administration has made all the preparations on its own,” CM Omar said. “The effectiveness of these arrangements will only be known once snowfall actually begins.”\nHe expressed confidence that while snowfall may cause temporary disruptions, people should not complain, as they had been eagerly awaiting it.\nThe CM said that the government was fully alert to ensure minimum inconvenience to the public.\nHe dismissed allegations that he adopts different political positions in Delhi and in Jammu and Kashmir.\nCM Omar said his stand has remained consistent everywhere.\n“I say this here, and I say this everywhere. I am not one of those people who play politics and deceive people,” he said.\nThe CM said he has never hesitated to acknowledge the Centr’s support where it exists, nor to point out its failures.\n“Where the central government has helped, I say that. Where the central government has been lacking, I say that too,” he said.\nOn the issue of restoration of statehood to J&K, CM Omar said the Centre had failed to address the long-standing demand.\n“I have said that the Centre has not given us anything other than complaints on the issue of statehood,” he said. “I will not make false statements to appease anyone. It will be wrong for me to lie to keep someone’s heart.”\nThe CM said he had consistently raised the demand for statehood at all available forums.\n“I have said this in meetings, programmes, and in the Assembly in Srinagar and Jammu. I have said this again and again,” he said.\nCM Omar also criticised the amended MGNREGA legislation, stating that the changes were detrimental to states like J&K.\nHe said the Centre had shifted the burden of the rural employment guarantee scheme onto states.\nTaking a dig at the name of the new bill – Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill – the CM said it appeared poorly thought out.\n“Where did this name come from? I am sorry, but they should name a bill only after thinking carefully. It reminds me of an old Bollywood movie ‘Ji Mummy Ji,’” the CM said.\nObjecting strongly to the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the scheme, he said the move was wrong.\n“First, you removed Mahatma Gandhi’s name, which is wrong. Then, you have put the burden of this scheme on the states. There are many changes in this Bill that will harm states like ours and not benefit us,” CM Omar said.",
