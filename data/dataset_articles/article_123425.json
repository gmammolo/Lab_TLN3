  "text": "Derrick Henry's usage rate should rise as the temperatures keep falling\nThe temperature keeps dropping, which means it's Derrick Henry season for the Ravens.\nGeoffrey A Knox\nFootball purists are certainly going to find fault with the direction the NFL is headed in. What's going on with all of these stadiums being built with roofs?\nSome are retractable. We get it, but the old-school fan in all of us can sometimes fall in love with doing things the way they have always been done. Football should be played indoors and on grass. Imagine the Baltimore Ravens playing in perfect climate-controlled weather at M&T Bank Stadium.\nIt doesn't make sense. The angels are weeping somewhere in football heaven. There's a beauty to seeing the temperature drop and knowing the weather will begin to play a factor in the game's outcome.\nCold weather means defenses take over. So do teams with powerful running games. Those are two things we see as being synonymous with John Harbaugh's Ravens.\nThe playoff chase is on. Three games remain in Baltimore's regular season, and we're all starved for a heavier dose of 'you know who'.\nDerrick Henry's season nears as the temperature continues to drop.\nOkay, here's where we all sound hypocritical. There's a need to split carries with Derrick Henry and someone else at tailback. No one wants to see the future Hall of Famer beaten to death by a heavier workload like Saquon Barkley last season with the Philadelphia Eagles.\nKeaton Mitchell seems like a nice complementary piece. He allows the Ravens' offense a little 'thunder and lightning'. There is, however, another side to that coin. How does a sane offensive coordinator take carries away from Derrick Henry?\nIt's getting cold outside. The wind is picking up, and this is typically when teams begin handing off the ball more often. It's a welcome theory when Derrick Henry is on your side.\n\"Well, I think [Derrick Henry] is a threat no matter what the temperature is, but I do think that as the temperature drops, or the weather changes, the running game certainly comes to the forefront. I think he's a hard guy to tackle. I think we've played well at the back end of the year, I think the statistics would back that up.\"\nThose were Todd Monken's words to the media. He was asked recently about Henry's brilliance in December and January.\n\"When you're playing well, that means you're ahead, and you're running in the third and fourth quarter, and you're wearing down the defense. I think that would hold true even in the playoffs [like] when we played the\n[Texans]or the Steelers over the last few years. You're able to get ahead, stay ahead and run the football.\"\nThat makes sense to us. Let's hope Baltimore is salting the game away during the second half of their upcoming tilt vs. the New England Patriots. Make no mistake. They have some ballers on the defensive side of the ball.\nBaltimore's challenge will be knowing when to lean on Henry and when to rest him. This game is a sprint, not a marathon, and there is still a ton of football left to play.",
