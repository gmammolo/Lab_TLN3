  "text": "FOX45 Baltimore Chief Meteorologist Gerard Jebaily had a little fun with social media on Wednesday after sharing a graphic showing the “chance of a white Christmas” across Maryland and the surrounding region.\nAt first glance, the map looks festive, with splashes of blue, pink, and teal covering much of Maryland and Northern Virginia (including both the DC and Baltimore metro areas). A closer look, however, reveals the joke: every color on the legend represents a zero percent chance of snow. One section even reads “0% but in pink,” making it clear that the entire forecast points to no snowfall on Christmas Day.\nJebaily leaned into the humor with his caption, writing, “ 😃❄🌨 WHITE CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?!?! 🎅 I wouldn’t bet on it 🙁 Maybe next year. ” Despite the clear message, the post sparked a lively comment section with hundreds of reactions and comments.\nSome readers accused him of “fake news,” while others insisted it would be too warm to snow or said they would “believe it when they see it.” Jebaily responded by pointing out that the graphic shows zero chance of snow everywhere and suggested commenters take a moment to actually read what the map says.\nThe playful post quickly gained attention, serving as both a lighthearted moment and a reminder that sometimes the forecast, and the joke, is all in the details.\n😃❄🌨 WHITE CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR?!?! 🎅\nI wouldn't bet on it 🙁 Maybe next year @foxbaltimore pic.twitter.com/YEJOJEVMZs\n— Gerard Jebaily ☈🌪 (@GerardJebaily) December 17, 2025",
