  "text": "OpenSnow tracking Tahoe’s Christmas miracle as multiple feet of snow are forecasted\nSignificant winter storm to follow weekend system that will bring rain and the potential for feet of base building snow at the highest elevations\nLAKE TAHOE, Calif./Nev. – The slow start to winter in the Lake Tahoe region is about to come to a close according to OpenSnow, a trusted source for the most accurate U.S. weather forecasts, snow reports, and weather maps. Following an atmospheric river event that is expected to bring rain to all but the highest elevations (above 8,000′ and sometimes 9,000′) this weekend, the first significant snowfall down to lake level is in the forecast beginning Christmas Eve, with anywhere from one to three feet of snow forecasted at lake level, and two to four feet of snow on the mountains.\n“The ensemble models have continued to consistently show this storm taking shape over the past two weeks, and every day we get closer to it, confidence builds in the anticipated snowfall totals we could see,” said veteran OpenSnow and Tahoe forecaster Bryan Allegretto. “Now that we’re just five days out from this first big storm system of the season, it’s fair to say the Tahoe region should expect two to four feet or more on the mountains by next Friday, but we’ll continue to adjust the forecast as we get closer to the holiday.”\nLeveraging its own proprietary forecasting technology, including its new AI-powered forecasting models, OpenSnow’s forecasts are up to 50% more accurate than standard forecasting models in mountainous terrain.\n“My guess is that the mountains will start to open up a lot of terrain, and conditions will improve by next Friday, the 26th, into the weekend of the 27th-28th. They will also be able to start making snow again if they need to, with the colder air behind the storms,” continued Allegretto.\nLearn more about OpenSnow’s Base and Premium subscriptions and how they can be shared by up to four people at OpenSnow.com and by downloading the OpenSnow app.\nSupport Local Journalism\nSupport Local Journalism\nReaders around Lake Tahoe, Truckee, and beyond make the Sierra Sun's work possible.
