  "text": "Heat Miser returns after a brief cooldown\nA near record warm Christmas likely\nThe beautiful weather looks to continue on Sunday with plenty of sunshine and highs in the low 60s in the Piedmont. Clouds will be more common in the High Country where highs will peak in the upper 40s. Tomorrow will also feature a backdoor cold front as cooler air funnels in from the NE by the evening and into the early morning hours of Monday. This means Monday will feel much more like what you’d expect during the week of Christmas. Highs will be close to 50 in the Queen City and in the low to mid 40s in the High Country.\nEven with this brief cooldown, if you are dreaming of a tropical Christmas, then you’re in luck! I’m tracking a big warm up after Monday with the potential for a top 5 warmest Christmas on record in Charlotte. High pressure will work offshore after Monday which will help to change the flow to from the south. This will help to bring warm air from the tropics from Tuesday through Christmas with each day likely warmer than the previous. Christmas eve and Christmas day highs look to be near 70 in the Piedmont. While we likely don’t break the Christmas record high of 77 set back in 1955 we will likely crack the top 5 or even top 3 warmest on record.\nIf you are dreaming of a white Christmas this year the closest location to likely have snow on the ground will be the interior of the Northeast. Make sure to enjoy the holiday week ahead, and stick with the WCCB weather team for the latest!\nTonight: Clear. Low: 35°. Wind: Calm\nSunday: Mostly sunny. High 62°. Wind: N 5-10\nSunday Night: Mostly clear. Low: 32°. Wind: N 5\nMonday: Partly cloudy. High 51°. Wind: Calm",
