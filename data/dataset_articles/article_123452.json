  "text": "Caleb Williams Embraces the Cold, and the Bears Are Heating Up at the Right Time\nThe wind chill is biting in Chicago, and the calendar says December-but thatâ€™s exactly how the Bears like it. Historically, Soldier Field in January is not just a stadium, itâ€™s a proving ground. And if Week 15 was any indication, Caleb Williams is more than ready for the challenge.\nIn a game that felt like a playoff dress rehearsal, the rookie quarterback delivered his most complete performance of the season-against one of the NFLâ€™s top defenses, no less. Williams went 17-of-28 for 242 yards and three touchdowns, slicing through Clevelandâ€™s secondary with the kind of poise you donâ€™t often see from a first-year signal caller.\nAnd he did it in freezing temperatures that would make most quarterbacks tighten up. Not Williams.\nHe looked like he was built for it.\nThereâ€™s a nickname starting to stick around Halas Hall: â€œIceman.â€� And after what we saw against the Browns, it fits. Williams didnâ€™t just survive the cold-he thrived in it.\nThe Bears didnâ€™t need to change their game plan. They didnâ€™t need to shelter their rookie quarterback or lean extra hard on the ground game.\nInstead, they came out aggressive, took control early, and never let go of the steering wheel in a 31-3 rout. Williams was the engine behind it all, showing confidence, command, and the kind of cold-weather toughness that Chicago quarterbacks are expected to have-but few have delivered.\nAfter the game, Williams spoke with a calm that echoed his on-field demeanor. â€œWe practice outside in this weather with no heaters, no benches, no anything,â€� he said.\nâ€œItâ€™s football weather, itâ€™s game day. Youâ€™ve got a lot of adrenaline.\nWeâ€™ve got the benches, the heaters, the jackets, which everybody does a good job with, and then you go out there and you get going and you forget about those things.â€�\nThatâ€™s the kind of mindset you want from your quarterback in December and January. Williams isnâ€™t just adapting to Chicago-heâ€™s embracing it. And thatâ€™s a huge deal for a franchise thatâ€™s long prided itself on winning ugly when the weather turns.\nThe Bears have always leaned on two things when theyâ€™re at their best: a punishing ground game and a defense that forces turnovers. That formula is alive and well this season. But now, theyâ€™ve added a third piece to the puzzle-an ascending quarterback who doesnâ€™t blink in the cold.\nWith Seattleâ€™s win over the Rams, the Bears still have a sliver of hope for the NFCâ€™s top seed, but even if that doesnâ€™t pan out, theyâ€™re in position to host at least one-and potentially two-playoff games at Soldier Field. And if Williams continues to play like he did against Cleveland, thatâ€™s a scenario no visiting team is going to be excited about.\nEvery week, Williams is looking more like the franchise quarterback Chicago has been searching for. And in a city where cold-weather performance matters, heâ€™s already checking one of the biggest boxes.\nIf this is what the Bears look like when the temperature drops, donâ€™t be surprised if theyâ€™re the team nobody wants to face once the playoffs roll around. Caleb Williams is heating up-and so are the Bears.",
