  "text": "Beyond blanketing the Wood River Valley in snow, Thursday's winter storm opened up a myriad of cross-country skiing and snowshoeing opportunities at Galena Lodge north of Ketchum.\nThe lodge received well over a foot of snow, said Chelan Oldemeyer, one of the lodge's operators, on Friday.\nThough the lodge opened earlier this month, Oldemeyer said, most trails were not usable until the Thursday storm.",
