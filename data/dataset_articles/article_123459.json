  "text": "Mild Sunday, even warmer week ahead\nHighs in the 50s Sunday\nWICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - We will have one more day with highs in the 50s on Sunday, then a big warm up is expected for the week ahead.\nIt will be a cold start to the day on Sunday with morning low temperatures in the mid to upper 20s. Afternoon highs will reach the lower 50s.\nLighter winds are on the way Sunday over central and eastern Kansas, but western Kansas will have a south wind gusting between 20 and 30 miles per hour.\nThe warming trend will begin on Monday with highs expected to reach the 60s across the entire state. Highs will remain in the 60s again on Tuesday with some patchy fog possible during the morning along and southeast of the Kansas Turnpike.\nThe warmest days this week will be Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when high temperatures will likely reach the 70s statewide. Record highs are likely for many locations on Christmas Day.\nA cold front will move through at the end of the week, bringing temperatures back into the 50s by next weekend.\nRain chances remain on hold, but some computer models are hinting at the possibility of rain returning to Kansas at the end of the month or into early January. Details are still uncertain this far out, but it is something we will be watching into the week ahead.\nWICHITA AREA FORECAST\nTonight: Partly cloudy. Wind: NE/E 5-15.
