  "text": "Will 2025 be the warmest Christmas in Indianapolis ever? 'We're in record territory'\nAlysa Guffey\nIndianapolis is expected to have a warm holiday week, with temperatures on Christmas Day reaching potential record highs.\nThe National Weather Service is predicting a high of 64 degrees in Indianapolis this coming Thursday, which would tie a record high temperature set in 1893 for the warmest Christmas Day on record since the NWS began recording data in 1871.\nSince 1871, the high temperature on Dec. 25 has been over 60 degrees just five times. Two of those days have come in the past five years.\n\"We're in record territory,\" NWS Indianapolis meteorologist Cody Moore told IndyStar. \"We came really close in 2021 with a high of 63 degrees, and then 62 degrees in 2019, so it's not too uncommon that it's been this warm in recent years.\"\nIndianapolis can expect warm weather throughout the week and virtually no chance for a white, snowy holiday week.\nThe travel forecast is looking \"pretty good\" through Christmas and New Year's Eve, albeit there's a slight chance of rain on the morning of Dec. 25, Moore said. But he cautioned that travelers should still check the forecast before heading out.\nIndianapolis weather forecast\n☀️ Sunday: Sunny with a high of 35 degrees.\n☁️/☁️ Sunday night: Partly cloudy skies. The low will be around 24 degrees.\n🌥️ Monday: Sunshine and clouds with a high near 47 degrees.\n🌧️/☁️ Monday night: A 50 percent chance of rain. Cloudy skies with a low of 42 degrees.\n☁️ Tuesday: Mostly cloudy with a high of 56 degrees.\n☁️ Tuesday night: Mostly cloudy skies with a low of 34 degrees.\n☁️/🌧️ Wednesday (Christmas Eve): A 20 percent chance of rain after 1 p.m. Mostly cloudy with a high of 56 degrees.\n🌧️ Wednesday night (Christmas Eve): There's a 60% chance of rain, meaning showers are likely. The low will be around 49 degrees.\n☁️ Thursday (Christmas Day): Warm, and mostly cloudy with a high near 64 degrees. A 20 percent chance of rain.\n☁️ Thursday night (Christmas Day): Mostly cloudy, reaching a low of 52 degrees. Still a 20 percent chance of rain.\n☁️ Friday: Mostly cloudy. Still warm, with a high near 60 degrees.\nHere's the winter weather info you need\n🚨 Indiana Weather Alerts: Warnings, Watches and Advisories.\n⚡ Indiana power outage map: How to check your status.\n💻 Internet outages: How to track them.\n🚫 What you should and shouldn't do when the power is out.\n🐶 Your neighbor left their pet outside.
