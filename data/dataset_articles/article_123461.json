  "text": "The temperature dropped last night, and our hard-working snowmakers jumped into action. We are presently making snow on Lower Chilcoot and Mulcahy’s Link. We received an inch of new snow in the past 24 hours, 9 inches in the week, and 119 inches this season. We plan to have 4 lifts operating tomorrow: Sterling, Village, Mogul Mouse’s Magic, and Sir Henry’s Slider. The Village Lift and Sterling Lift will open at 8 am. Mogul Mouse’s Magic Lift will open at 9 am. Our talented grooming staff will be busy tonight. We plan to have 20 trails groomed for tomorrow, including Smugglers’ Alley, Midway, Meadowlark, Black Snake, and Howie’s Wanderer for a total of 100 acres of freshly groomed terrain. Surface conditions are machine groomed and loose granular with average base depths of 12 to 42 inches. Currently, it is cloudy and 15 degrees at the summit of Sterling. Tomorrow’s forecast is cloudy skies with a chance of snow showers early, breezy, a high of 29 degrees at the base and 24 degrees at higher elevations.
