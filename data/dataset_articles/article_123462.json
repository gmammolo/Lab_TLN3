  "text": "Turning cold tonight, but a big & prolonged warm up on the way next week\nGood Saturday afternoon everyone!\nAnother gusty day across the area so far! Winds out of the northwest have been gusting between 30-45 mph across our area, with Rochester seeing a gust of 45 mph earlier this afternoon. MSP saw a gust of 52 mph! These strong wind gusts indicate much colder weather on the way behind a cold front that passed through earlier today.\nTemperatures will dip into the teens this evening, with winds between 10 to 15 mph. Winds relax significantly overnight, but temperatures drop into the single digits across the entire viewing area, under a mainly clear sky. Wind chills by early Sunday morning will be close to, if not below, 0F.\nSunday will start out brisk, with temperatures climbing out of the single digits, and winds on the lighter side. Winds shift to out of the south throughout Sunday, between 5 to 15 mph, gusting up to 20 mph at times. This will boost temperatures well into the 20F’s across most of the area, with some folks likely seeing 30F Sunday afternoon. Skies will be on the sunny side, with a few clouds moving in during the afternoon.\nThings become a bit more complicated Sunday night into early Monday morning. Temperatures bottom out in the low-mid 20F’s Sunday evening, before climbing into the low-30F’s overnight. A warm front will pass through the area after midnight, with winds remaining on the breezy side out of the south/southwest between 10 to 15 mph, gusting up to 25 mph at times.\nLow-level moisture is going to be rather low, but there will be a good deal of moisture in the mid-levels of the atmosphere, along with forcing from the passing warm front. Temperatures near the surface will be primarily below freezing most of the night, with slightly warmer temperatures likely aloft. This would set the stage for any precipitation falling in the form of freezing rain late Sunday night into early Monday, although if enough dry air is present and can cool the air down a bit, some snow could mix in.\nThis does not appear to be a major precipitation event by any means, however, enough freezing rain/snow could fall to lead to slick spots on the roads early Monday. With that said, we might need to be a bit cautious when it comes to the Monday morning commute. Most precipitation should be done by daybreak, but lingering icy spots are a good bet if road temperatures dip below freezing. Something to watch for!\nThe rest of the week will be dominated by a building ridge of high pressure that will linger across the Central United States for a prolonged period of time. This will keep us not only mainly dry through Christmas, but warm relative to average as well.\nClouds clear the area Monday, with sunshine sticking around through at least the first half of Tuesday. Temperatures top out in the mid-upper 30F’s Monday, and in the mid-30F’s Tuesday. It will be a bit breezy Monday, with winds relaxing by Tuesday.\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day are shaping up to be on the drearier and foggy side of things based on current trends. Temperatures top out in the mid-upper 30F’s Christmas Eve, and in the low-mid 40F’s Christmas Day. Skies will be primarily cloud covered, with the potential for fog developing Wednesday evening and lasting through Thursday. With temperatures well above freezing both days, it is highly unlikely any of us will have a white Christmas sadly.\nThings look to remain quiet through next weekend, with highs remaining well-above normal through early next week. Safe to say that winter is going to be taking a bit of a break over the next week or two!",
