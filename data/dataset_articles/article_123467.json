  "text": "Excelsior Correspondent\nSRINAGAR, Dec 20: Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Anshul Garg today said the administration is fully prepared for the upcoming snowfall, with all necessary arrangements in place.\nHe said measures have been put in place across Kashmir, particularly in higher reaches, border areas and along key axes, including Zojila, while 24×7 control rooms have been activated to ensure public convenience.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of Pheran Day and Jashn-e-Chillai Kalan celebrations at Kashmir Haat here, Garg said snowfall is expected and the administration is fully prepared to handle the situation.\n“We hope snowfall will continue this winter, especially in the higher reaches. Preparations have been made along all key routes, including Zojila, and adequate arrangements are in place across the Valley,” Garg said.\nHe said the Integrated Command and Control Centre as well as district-level control rooms are functioning 24×7 to respond promptly to any weather-related exigencies and ensure uninterrupted essential services.\nExpressing optimism over the winter season, Garg said snowfall is also expected to give a boost to tourism in Kashmir.\n“We are hopeful that the winter season will witness an increase in tourist footfall, which will benefit the local economy,” he added.\nEarlier, the Divisional Commissioner congratulated the Handicrafts and Handlooms Department for organising the exhibition, which also marked Pheran Day and the 40th anniversary of Kashmiri Artisans’ Day.\nHe said such events reflect Kashmir’s age-old traditions and cultural warmth while providing a platform to artisans.\nGarg also praised initiatives such as ‘Know Your Artisan’ and the handholding of weavers and traditional craftsmen.\n“These efforts have strengthened the handicrafts sector’s presence in Srinagar and beyond, particularly ahead of the winter and tourist seasons.”",
