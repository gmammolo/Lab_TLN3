  "text": "We've got some significant shifts in play over the coming days that we’ll be monitoring closely. Today, we're seeing a much-needed rebound in temperatures, offering a chance to enjoy some milder conditions before a reinforcing cold blast arrives on Sunday. So, if you have outdoor plans today, take advantage of it!\nAs we move into the Christmas week, get ready for a substantial warmup. We're forecasting a shift into the 60s by Tuesday, and these warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected to stick around through the remainder of the holiday week. This extended warmth is certainly something a bit unusual for this time of year, and we'll be keeping a close watch on how it impacts our region. The best chance for rain looks to arrive Monday evening through early Tuesday, so we will be monitoring if any precipitation develops that could affect travel plans.\nAfter that, we'll see smaller chances of rain pop up later in the week, but nothing significant is expected to disrupt the holiday cheer. While we are not expecting severe weather, the pattern does suggest some variability with rainfall chances early in the week, so we will keep you updated on any changes to that forecast.",
