  "text": "Bo’s First Alert 6 Forecast: A dry & very warm holiday week, breezy winds Monday\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Another peaceful and cool night is ahead for the metro. Mostly clear skies and calm winds are expected tonight with lows falling to the lower to mid 20s. Wind chills will likely fall to the mid to upper teens.\nSunday will be another mostly sunny day with a few passing clouds. Highs will be similar to Saturday in the mid 40s. The potential of flurries look to stay north of the metro.\nMonday will be the first of many days where highs will be in the 50s. Breezy winds are likely to return on Monday as well reaching up to 20-25 mph from the south.\nChristmas Day has the best chance of hitting 60 degrees at this point and we currently are forecasting a record high of 58°.
