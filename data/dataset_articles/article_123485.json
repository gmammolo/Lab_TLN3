  "text": "Hello there! Another mild day is ahead for the Spokane area, with drier conditions expected until Christmas Eve.\nYour Sunday will start with some sunshine. We'll stay cool with highs in the upper 30s, still above average for this time of year. There's a chance of some late showers into early Monday morning—so it might be a good time for some last-minute shopping!\nSunday is also the \"longest\" day of the year, meaning it's the point when our days stop getting shorter. The Winter Solstice arrives at 7:03 a.m. tomorrow morning. Say goodbye to a very wet fall season!\nOver the next seven days, highs will hover in the upper 30s to lower 40s, routinely staying above average for this time of year. Overnight lows will continue to linger around freezing. A rain-snow mix is likely on Wednesday (Christmas Eve) and Thursday (Christmas Day).\nEnjoy!\n—Jason\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 BY KXLY.
