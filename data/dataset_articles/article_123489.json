  "text": "Winds calm down Sunday, and the warm-up starts\nHere’s your Saturday evening forecast for December 20, 2025 from Meteorologist Matt Serwe.\nI am excited to tell you these strong winds are taking a break for a bit! Peak gusts topped 50 mph around the Twin Cities Saturday morning. Winds continue to calm down tonight, letting temperatures fall close to 0° in the metro. South winds are back Sunday afternoon, only gusting to 15 mph at times.\nThe warmer air is getting in a little quicker than expected Sunday. Afternoon temperatures reach the mid to upper 20s in the Twin Cities. There will be plenty of sun through the first half of the day, and then clouds roll in for the afternoon.\nSunday night, very light snow and freezing drizzle is possible. Amounts will be very light, and I doubt there will be many slippery spots Monday morning. This should not bother the morning commute, or people doing some early Christmas traveling.\nThe entire week of Christmas should be in the 30s and 40s in the Twin Cities. You will see more grassy spots by Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but it should technically be a white Christmas. A little drizzle is possible Wednesday and Thursday. Cooler weather arrives by the weekend, and some snow could mix in with the rain.",
