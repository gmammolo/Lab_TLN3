  "text": "8 hours ago Lots of snow cancels school and businesses, while state authorities say highway fatalities are down.\nLast week, snowfall, and the threat of more, kept schools closed for the week, and delayed work days and other business for folks across Carroll County. The snow also meant plenty of fun, and readers shared hundred of photos with The Carroll News.\nTragically, an out-of-state traveler lost his life in a Thanksgiving weekend crash on Interstate 77. Despite the incident, state officials said highway fatalities across Virginia were actually down over the holiday week.\nThese and many more stories are available in this week's Carroll News.",
