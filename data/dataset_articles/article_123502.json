  "text": "NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - It was a very nice afternoon with highs in 70s after a chilly start to Saturday morning. We can expect much more mild conditions overnight heading into Sunday. Southerly winds continue to push in plenty of moisture and a weak boundary moving across the region Sunday into Monday will trigger a few light to moderate showers. Look for about 30 percent coverage on the day. Everyone will not see rain and totals will be low for most areas that do. Temperatures will peak in the 70s.\nHigh pressure builds in for Monday and we will see warm and dry trend through the Christmas holiday. Temperatures will be in the 50s and 60s overnight with daytime highs in the 70s. Fog is likely for the overnights as water temperatures have cooled and we will see warm, moist air pushing across the chilly waters.\nSee a spelling or grammar error in our story?
