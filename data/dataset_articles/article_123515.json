  "text": "Lara alerts consumers across the state about insurance coverage ahead of winter storms\nAs severe winter storms are predicted to pelt the state with extreme wind, rain, and snow, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara is working to help Californians understand their insurance coverage and how they can recover from storm damage.\nThe length and nature of the storm is predicted to bring the type, intensity and duration of rainfall that can lead to significant flooding, in many areas, including those areas where communities may be less aware of flood risks.\nThe Department has posted a Top 10 Tips for People Affected by Winter Storms to answer questions about what consumers’ insurance policies may cover (scroll down to read these tips).\nLara is also alerting communities affected by wildfires in recent years that this rainfall may trigger debris flows, especially on south-facing slopes. Communities should be on alert and take practical pre-cautions, including those listed by IBHS and local flood risk officers, and pay attention to early-warning systems, including alerts from the National Weather Service. Consumers should also check their home or rental insurance policies, and remember insurance companies have a legal duty to cover damage from any mudslide, debris flow, or similar disaster that is caused by the recent statewide wildfires that may have weakened hillsides.\n“Consumer protection is our top priority,” Lara said. “We want to make sure everyone stays safe as we enter the holidays. I am working to make sure residents in areas affected by recent wildfires know their rights in the event that they suffer further damage from debris flows. Experts with my department stand ready during the holiday season to help consumers with claims and questions about their policies.”\nA “burn scar” refers to land left bare after a wildfire, making it prone to flash floods and debris flows. Without vegetation to absorb rain, water runs off quickly, and wildfire heat can create a water-repellent soil layer, worsening the risk. Even light rain can trigger dangerous flooding, especially in steep areas. Homes, roads, and infrastructure near recent burn areas face heightened danger, often with little warning.\nMany policyholders may not be aware that homeowners’ and commercial insurance policies typically exclude flood, mudslide, debris flow and other similar disasters — unless they are directly or indirectly caused by a recent wildfire or another peril covered by the applicable insurance policy. However, they can cover water damage from wind-driven rain that occurs during a storm and damage from fallen trees. Comprehensive vehicle insurance can also cover flood damage and other winter storm damage. The Department of Insurance has posted a fact sheet for consumers to answer questions about what their policies cover.\nLara urges consumers to take the following steps to prepare for the winter storm season\n• Have a family emergency plan and choose a safe meeting point and prepare an emergency kit.\n• Use their smart phone to perform a home inventory to create a record of their belongings and store scans of important documents that they can easily access.\n• Locate their insurance papers and put in a safe place or upload to an online location.\n• For renters, consider purchasing renters’ insurance to protect their personal belongings, which typically are not covered by their landlord’s homeowners’ policy.\n• Consider comprehensive auto insurance, which will protect their vehicle in the event of flood damage.\n• Visit the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services “winter wise” web page to read more tips to prepare for winter weather. CalOES also has storm season safety information.\n• Consider flood insurance for future disasters in addition to their homeowners’ insurance policy. The National Flood Insurance Program currently provides the majority of flood coverage written in the state, but private flood insurance is also available. Flood insurance takes effect 30 days after it is purchased, except in the case of a home purchase where flood insurance is required by the lender.\nTop 10 tips for people affected by winter storms\n1. Obtain a complete copy of your residential homeowners’ insurance policy, including your declarations page. The law requires your insurance company to provide this to you free of charge within 30 days of your request. Review the definitions section of the policy including types of water damage that is covered and excluded. Ask your agent or insurance company representative to explain how much coverage you have and how to most effectively claim your benefits.\n2. Homeowners policies do not cover flood damage, but they may cover other kinds of water damage. For example, they would generally pay for damage from rain coming through a hole in the roof or a broken window, as long as the hole was caused by strong winds or any other covered exposure listed in the policy. If there is water damage, check with your insurance company representative as to whether it is covered.\n3. Damage caused from fallen trees are generally covered under all standard homeowner policies. There may be exceptions. Please consult with your agent or your insurance company.\n4. Damaged vehicles as a result of flood or fallen trees are generally covered under the “Comprehensive” or “Other than Collision” portion of the auto policy. Check your auto insurance declaration page to see if this optional coverage was purchased and in effect at the time of loss.\n5. Check your deductible and assess the situation. If the damage is below the deductible, the insurance company would not be obligated to pay. Of course, move forward to report the damages to your insurance company if the damages exceed your deductible.\n6. Make temporary repairs to prevent your property from further damage. Take pictures and keep records of all clean up and repair costs. Don’t make permanent repairs until the insurance adjuster sees the damage.\n7. Document all of your conversations with your insurance company/adjuster about your claim and policy limitations in a dedicated “claim diary.” If your adjuster says something is excluded, limited, or subject to certain conditions, ask the adjuster to point out the specific provision in your policy being cited.\n8. Get at least one estimate or bid on the cost to repair your home to get a reasonable sense of the actual cost as compared to your coverage limits. This estimate can be compared with an estimate prepared by your insurance company.\n9. Before you hire a contractor, check their licensing status, including any complaint registered with the Contractors State License Board. View the CDI’s electronic brochure Don’t Get Scammed After a Disaster.\n10. Call the Department of Insurance Hotline at 800-927-4357 or through online chat at our website: insurance.ca.gov.\nPlease note: These tips are for general guidance only and are not a substitute for legal advice.",
