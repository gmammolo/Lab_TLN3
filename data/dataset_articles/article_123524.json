  "text": "Mumbai News\nMumbai Weather Delight: Light Haze Over Arabian Sea, AQI Stays Below 100 - Check Forecast\n- Authored by:\nPranjal Gupta - Updated Dec 21, 2025, 08:50 IST\nMumbai witnessed smoggy, hazy conditions with moderate AQI and colder nights, while Maharashtra saw intensifying winter chill. Clear skies are forecast, but cool nights are likely to persist.\nMumbai Weather Today: Light Misty Haze Over Arabian Sea, Air Quality in ‘Moderate’ Zone\nMumbai Weather: A layer of smog covered Mumbai on Sunday morning, affecting visibility across several parts of the city. The hazy conditions created a muted view along the iconic Marine Drive, which many morning walkers found visually striking despite the reduced clarity. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Mumbai’s Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 98, indicating moderate air quality.\nMeanwhile, temperatures dipped further, with the city recording a nighttime minimum of 14.6°C, bringing a noticeable chill as winter begins to set in.\nAcross Maharashtra, cold northerly winds associated with western disturbances are intensifying winter conditions, The Indian Express. Several districts are now reporting single-digit minimum temperatures, making nights significantly colder than usual. Early morning fog has also been observed in many areas, lowering visibility and adding to the wintry feel. Interior regions are bearing the brunt of the cold as chilly winds continue to blow from the north.\n“This is a normal weather phenomenon and at present, there is no probability of western disturbances, which is why the air flow and circulation will remain the same. We can expect the temperature to stay on these lines for the next few days, which means that Mumbai’s city and suburbs will continue to experience colder nights,” said Sushma Nair, scientist at the IMD Mumbai, quoted by the media report.\nThe weather department has said the cold spell is likely to persist for at least the next three days. During this period, nights are expected to remain particularly cold, and residents have been advised to take precautions, especially during early morning and late evening hours.\nMumbai Weather Forecast\n21 December: The day will see clear skies with a maximum temperature of 33°C and a minimum of 18°C.
