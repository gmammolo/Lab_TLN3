  "text": "WINTER STARTS AT 9:03 AM ON SUNDAY MORNING!!\nWe will see some mighty warm temperatures for this time of year gradually move into our area over the next few days. I think we will stay just a slight bit above normal for Sunday and Monday, however as we go through our Christmas holiday we will be unseasonably warm. Some places could easily be about 20 degrees normal for this time of the year. We will see many areas reach into the lower to middle 70s for the highs. Even some of the spots flirting with 80 degrees for a high. Yes, very close to some record breaking temperatures for this time of year",
