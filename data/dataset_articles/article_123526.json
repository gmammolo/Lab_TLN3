  "text": "Brighter days are on their way.\nSunday marks the Northern Hemisphere’s winter solstice, the shortest day of the year — when the sun rises at 7:55 a.m. and sets at 4:20 p.m., bringing eight hours, 25 minutes and 25 seconds of precious daylight. And after that, we’ll be rewarded with a few more moments of light every day.\nBy June, we’ll be basking in nearly 16 glorious hours of daylight per day.\nBut before that, more rain.\nThe shortest day of the year will start with widespread showers in the Greater Seattle area and continuous snowfall in the mountains, said Nathan Lynum, a meteorologist at the Seattle office of the National Weather Service.\nThere could be a brief lull Sunday morning, but a weak cold front blowing in from the coast will bring the drizzle back by late afternoon, lasting into the evening, Lynum said. High temperatures are expected to reach about 46 to 48 degrees, while lows will hit around 42 to 43 degrees for the Seattle area.\nThe weather service isn’t predicting any additional flooding from heavy rains for the next few days, though four flood warnings remain in effect in Western Washington, Lynum said.\nTwo are still in effect for parts of the White River, near Mud Mountain Dam and at the R Street Bridge. Another warning remains for the Skokomish River near Potlatch in Mason County, and the fourth is for the Chehalis River in Grays Harbor County, Lynum said.\nIn general, most rivers are expected to continue receding over the next days, meaning the risk of levee failures is falling, according to a Saturday situation report from the weather service. Still, landslides are on the table due to soggy soil, and some minor coastal flooding is possible, the report said.\n“After the rainfall tomorrow and into Monday, we’re looking at a decrease in chance of precipitation as we go into mid- to late next week,” Lynum said.\nAnother downpour could be on its way next weekend, the weather service said, but it’s too soon to know if the pattern will mean another bout of widespread flooding for the region, which has already seen devastating destruction from recent back-to-back atmospheric rivers.\nAt a news conference Saturday, Gov. Bob Ferguson noted the possibility of another atmospheric river moving in around Dec. 28. In the meantime, the Washington National Guard will be patrolling levees in South King County. Swelling rivers broke through levees this past week in Tukwila and Pacific.\nIn the Cascade Mountains, moderate to heavy snow is predicted Sunday, with lighter flurries through Tuesday. It’s the perfect pack for the start of ski season, ski resorts say — though Lynum also encouraged travelers to keep an eye on the forecast and be careful when driving through the passes. Check for road closures, too. Major ski area routes including Highway 2 (Stevens Pass) remain partly cut off, while highways 542 (Mount Baker) and 410 (Crystal Mountain) were down to single-lane traffic in places due to washouts.",
