  "text": "Sunday the 21st is the solstice — the shortest day and longest night of the year. Then the days start getting longer, but slowly — about three seconds a day at first, and accelerating in such tiny increments the days don’t start feeling longer for weeks. And for even more weeks, the weather is mostly cold and dismal. Many of us want to crawl into bed and sleep until spring, like bears in beds with blankets.\nYet, this is the holiday season when we’re expected to be full of joy and busy baking cookies, even when the rest of the world sometimes seems to be going to hell in a handbasket. Google AI explains:\n\"Going to hell in a handbasket\" is an idiom meaning a situation is rapidly deteriorating, heading for disaster, or getting out of control, not a literal religious event. The phrase suggests a quick, easy, and inevitable descent into ruin, with origins debated but possibly linked to crude 18th-century imagery of carrying heads in baskets, mining baskets, or general alliteration.”\nThis AI definition is an odd bit of writing; it’s almost certainly the first time \"heads in baskets\" and \"alliteration\" have appeared in the same sentence. Still, haven’t a lot of us always wondered why a handbasket would be the chosen literary conveyance for a trip to hell?\nAI’s main flaw here is describing the trip to hell as quick and easy. All of the sin and suffering of today’s world is overwhelming, immeasurably sad, and very slow in its descent to doom.\nDark and dismal days, wars, murder on the high seas, climate change, economic turmoil, mass shootings and mass deportations ... and all that’s possibly just the warm-up for next year’s woe.\nClose to home there are other downers that pierce our hearts: expectations that can’t be met, vows that should not have been taken, injuries slow to heal, children or parents gone astray, payments too long overdue.\nAll this is a potent recipe for an outbreak of holiday depression, like food poisoning for the soul.\nFor all of these miseries, both global and local, major and minor, the natural world provides mitigation.\nGazing at the tops of fir trees on the horizon is not a cure, but it’s a comfort. They are at peace, doing what they do and being what they are. They invite us to stop for a moment, and open our eyes wider.\nIn this mostly wet, gray and stormy week, there have been brief sunny spells with intensely blue sky. In the sunlight, patches of green grass caught and held shimmering raindrops. Through a window, those episodes of sunlight even brightened an indoor room and, if you let it, the inside of a human.\nIt’s the “letting it in” that’s crucial. It’s one of the oddest features of modern life that so many people live in a natural world they barely see. Calling it “mother nature” doesn’t mean it’s revered; it means it’s taken for granted, in the way small children regard their mothers.\nThe power of nature to cheer us up is expressed in art of all kinds, and in store-bought bouquets, jewelry, fabrics and knickknacks with plant or animal images. That all life inspires art is obvious; what’s perhaps less obvious is that it’s the living original that inspires us most deeply.\nEven in these, our literal darkest hours, take the time to truly see the sky, trees, grass, birds, and colorful flocks of our fellow Homo sapiens. This is the antidote to soul poisoning that can restore our equilibrium and remind us that a turn towards the better is always possible, and always worth hoping for and working towards.\nA good Irish poem helps too:\n'Sometimes'\nSometimes things don’t go, after all,\nfrom bad to worse. Some years, muscadel\nfaces down frost; green thrives; the crops don’t fail.\nSometimes a man aims high, and all goes well.\nA people sometimes will step back from war,\nelect an honest man, decide they care\nenough, that they can’t leave some stranger poor.\nSome men become what they were born for.\nSometimes our best intentions do not go\namiss; sometimes we do as we meant to.\nThe sun will sometimes melt a field of sorrow\nthat seemed hard frozen; may it happen for you.\n3 comments on this item\nPlease log in to comment by clicking here\nMusicfan12b\nIf someone doesn't have a smile, give them one of yours.\nMy Grandmother said, \"You can always be kind.\" She lived most of her life before there were \"social programs\" for people to fall back on. No one ever left my Grandparents' home without having a cup of tea and something to eat.\nThank you Jill for reminding us we are all responsible and able to bring something to the table of life that others might find comfort and relief.\n10 hours ago\nReport this\nBobJacobs\nThanks to Jill for sharing her broad perspective and excellent writing skills.\nBob Jacobs\n8 hours ago\nReport this\nGretchen\nI love that poem! I have often sent it to friends who are struggling.\nMy husband and I try to walk outside every day, if even just a little. It cheers us, and even a small thing like a chickadee in our crabapple eating berries thrills me.\nLove this column!\n8 hours ago\nReport this",
