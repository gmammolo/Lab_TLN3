  "text": "As the solstice marks the turning point of winter, sunny spells later in the day will offer a first optimistic hint of returning light.\nTemperatures will range from 5 to 11°C, starting with 7–9°C in the foggy morning, warming up to a maximum of 11°C with sunny spells in the late afternoon, and cooling down to 5–7°C in the evening as the fog returns.\nHowever, as our days become gradually less cloudy, we can expect far lower temperatures in the medium term, with –4°C forecast for Christmas day.\nPolice have announced the following checks for today:\nGet your local forecast from our weather page.\nFor more information on traffic in the Grand Duchy, visit our traffic page, which includes motorway webcams.\nTo ensure you don’t miss out on the latest Luxembourg news, consider downloading our smartphone app, available for both Android and iOS.",
