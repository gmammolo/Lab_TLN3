  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Tx — Happy first day of Winter, Coastal Bend! We are wrapping up the weekend with a new season and warm temperatures.\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\nWe are closing the weekend welcoming in the winter solstice! Warm temperatures stick in the forecast this upcoming week with highs in the low 80s and lows in the mid 60s. Fog will linger through the morning before clearing by noon.\nA light cold front will approach the Coastal Bend but will fizzle out before making it here. This will not impact our temperatures but will give us the opportunity of some widespread showers tonight into Monday morning. This will be about our only rain chance this week before mostly sunny conditions take over the forecast.\nCORPUS CHRISTI FORECAST\nToday: Foggy start then mostly sunny\nTemperature: High 82ºF\nWinds: ESE 5-10 mph\nTonight: Mostly cloudy\nTemperature: Low 68ºF\nWinds: ESE 5-10 mph\nMonday: Partly sunny skies\nTemperature: High 82ºF\nWinds: SE 5-15 mph\nHave a great Sunday!",
