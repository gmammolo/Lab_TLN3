  "text": "Rainy day to be followed by beautiful weekend across Carolinas\nThursday will be wet but sunshine will return Friday and this weekend\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A rainy day will sandwich between several nice ones around the Carolinas, but don’t worry -- the nicer weather will be back soon.\nThursday is forecast to be a wet day; however, the rain will move out overnight with a beautiful weekend to follow.\nRainy Thursday\nGet set for a wet Thursday, when a First Alert is in place due to rain.\nThe rain will be spotty and on the lighter side around Charlotte and I-77 during the morning hours. However, moisture and a cold front will continue into the area and eventually spread to cover most of the area.\nBy midday, the rain will become increasing more widespread with that trend continuing into the evening hours. Rain may fall heavily at times, and a few rumbles of thunder cannot be ruled out.\nBy the time the rain pulls out very early Friday morning most neighborhoods will have picked up at least a half inch, if not a bit more.\nA few lingering snow showers will be possible across the High-Country early Friday morning.\nAfter the front clears the area, winds will pick up and gust to near 60 mph across the Mountains and near 30 mph outside of the higher elevations.\nNice weekend ahead\nSunshine will quickly come back Friday with highs in the upper 50s.\nAs for the weekend, it looks dry with mostly sunny skies and seasonal highs in the middle 50s Saturday before improving to the lower 60s Sunday afternoon.\nExpect a brief cool down Monday before warmer temperatures return on Tuesday. This may be the start of a prolonged period of warmer-than-normal conditions that will likely last through Christmas with highs in the 60s and lows in the 40s for the holiday.\nDownload the free WBTV Weather app on your mobile device to receive weather alerts and to get the latest forecast on the go.
