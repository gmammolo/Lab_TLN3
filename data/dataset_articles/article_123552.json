  "text": "The energy was high at the Snowy Range Ski and Recreation Area. The line of skiers and snowboard riders began forming at the chairlift Friday about an hour before the actual opening to start the season.\nFirst in line for the second year in a row was Laramie resident John Schaeffer. Three years ago, Schaeffer was beat out of getting on the coveted “first chair” by a couple of high school students playing hooky. He wasn’t going to let that happen for 2025.\n“If you’re not first, you’re last,” Schaeffer said with a laugh. His face was completely covered by both a face mask and goggles, as it was the year before.\nJoining him, mostly by coincidence, was Laramie resident Nate Gray. It was his first time making that opening chair, but it had more to do with his mistake in thinking the lifts opened at 8 a.m. instead of 9 a.m.\nSchaeffer is no stranger at the ski area, having started skiing there in 1987 when he was just 7 years old. He transitioned from skis to a snowboard in 1998 and had been enjoying the local slopes via snowboard ever since.\nWhile there’s no reward for getting on that first chair of the season, there are bragging rights. The two getting that honor this year also broke through a banner as the lift made its first turn for the official start of the season.\nIn attendance to welcome those in line were Aaron and Becky Maddox, now in their 16th year as ski area owners. That first year, Becky Maddox held their son, 7-month-old Charlie, in her arms. Their daughter, Chloe, now 13, was just a twinkle in her daddy’s eye.\nAccording to Becky, her daughter is now a fearless snowboard racer, dreaming of becoming a professional racer someday. Charlie, now 15, is an avid racer on the Laramie High School alpine ski team. How time flies, and the passion of both children for skiing and snowboarding indicate being born into a ski area owner family has its advantages.\nThe Maddox’s were joined two years ago by the management team of Riley and Bailey Copeland. This year, Riley holds 1-year-old Willa in his arms; she happened to be born on opening day last year. The couple manage much of the day-to-day mechanics of keeping the ski area running smoothly.\nAfter their first run of the season, Schaeffer and Gray raved about the conditions. Both gave the start of the season a solid thumbs-up.\n“It was awesome,” Schaeffer said after his first ride down the Virginian slope. He reached the bottom of the run in a flurry of snow, taking a header just before he got to the chairlift.\nGray, who happens to work at the ski area, gave credit to Aaron Maddox, who spent nine hours the previous night grooming the slopes to get them “just so” for opening day.\n“Aaron did a fantastic job grooming,” Gray said. “It was excellent and beautiful corduroy.”\nWhile opening day was postponed for one week due to the lack of snow, the heavens opened up about seven days prior to the rescheduled opening. Those 16 inches of natural snow, combined with snow-making efforts, allowed the ski area to open with 11 trails and three lifts. Aaron said that was one of their best openings ever.\nWhen asked about the dearth of snow in November, Aaron said he has learned to have patience if the snow is slow to arrive.\n“It’ll come,” Aaron said. “It always does.”\nSeveral improvements at the ski area this year won’t get much notice. One such upgrade is new paint on two of the chair lifts. That sounds simple enough, but painting chairs hanging in the air is tricky, taking more effort than one might expect.\nAnother such improvement is to the ski lodge to help prevent ice forming on the lower walkway. Drains are in place to keep the sidewalk clear. Also, a second shuttle bus was added to provide transport from the two outer parking lots to the lodge.\nA more noticeable improvement is on the second floor of the lodge where there is now a heated floor on the outdoor deck. It looks like a regular floor but, as snow falls, heating coils in the deck melt the snow, providing a snow-free outdoor area with a panoramic view of the slopes. There’s also a new fire pit on the deck, providing an ambience reminiscent of the fireplace in the old ski lodge that burned down in 2003.\nIt is time to dust off the skis and snowboards and head for the slopes.
