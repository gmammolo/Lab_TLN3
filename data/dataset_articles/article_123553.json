  "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — A stretch of calm, sunny weather is settling in across central Oklahoma, giving Oklahoma City a welcome break from recent active patterns and setting the stage for a mild lead-up to the Christmas holiday.\nThursday will be bright and dry, with sunshine dominating the sky and afternoon temperatures climbing into the upper 50s. Light northwesterly winds will increase slightly during the afternoon but are expected to remain manageable. Clear skies tonight will allow temperatures to dip into the upper 20s, bringing a chilly start to Friday morning.\nFriday continues the quiet trend, with abundant sunshine and highs warming into the lower 60s. Winds will turn southerly by afternoon, helping temperatures rebound quickly after the cold overnight low near 30 degrees. Mostly clear skies Friday night will keep conditions favorable for travel and outdoor plans.\nThe warming trend becomes more noticeable over the weekend. Saturday is expected to be sunny and unseasonably warm, with highs approaching 70 degrees across the Oklahoma City metro area. Saturday night cools into the upper 30s under partly cloudy skies. Sunday remains mild and pleasant, with mostly sunny conditions and highs in the mid-50s, followed by a mostly cloudy but still comfortable Sunday night.\nLooking ahead to the holiday week, forecasters say the pattern favors continued mild weather. Christmas Eve, which falls on Wednesday, is shaping up to feel more like early fall than late December. Current projections suggest partly sunny skies and temperatures climbing into the lower to mid-70s, with no significant precipitation expected at this time.\nWhile forecasters caution that details could change several days out, confidence is growing that Christmas Eve travel across central Oklahoma will be largely weather-friendly. For now, Oklahoma City residents can enjoy a sunny stretch that transitions smoothly into what appears to be a warm and quiet holiday forecast.",
