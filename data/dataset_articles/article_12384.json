  "text": "A well-preserved 1920 Gibson L-1 Round-hole archtop acoustic in incredible condition! Feels great with a full vintage \"V\" and sounds even better with a charming sound where the notes seem to fly off of the top with powerful transfer and resonance throughout. Excellent condition displaying a minimal amount of cosmetic wear for an instrument that's now over 100 years old! Perfect for old-time Jazz, Blues, Folk and fingerpicking. This cool piece of Gibson's history is begging to be played!
