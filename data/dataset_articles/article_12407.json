  "text": "Customers are flocking to Chick-fil-A in Citrus Plaza, which reopened Thursday, Dec. 28, after a 4½-month expansion. Changes include a widened drive-thru with two lanes narrowing to one after customers order, a reconfigured dining room and new restrooms with key pads on their doors to limit entrance. The restaurant [closed in mid-August](https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/2023/09/19/whats-happening-at-the-chick-fil-a-in-citrus-plaza/) for the project, which included tearing down some exterior walls. Citrus Plaza is in the “ [Donut Hole](https://www.sbsun.com/2014/04/20/construction-starts-in-controversial-donut-hole-near-redlands/),” an unincorporated area outside of Redlands city limits, although the city provides water, sewer, police and fire services in exchange for tax revenue. Contacted in September, representatives for San Bernardino County said the expansion increases storage space for an expected boost in drive-thru business, which was already brisk. Hours are 6:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday and 10:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday, according to the restaurant’s website. All Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed Sunday. The address is 27520 W Lugonia Ave. Information: [chick-fil-a.com](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/locations/ca/citrus-plaza)",
