  "text": "The Boston Celtics traded for Jrue Holiday just before the new NBA season began. The veteran guard had originally been moved to the Portland Trail Blazers as part of the deal that sent Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks . Since joining the Celtics, Holiday has proven himself to be a valuable addition to the rotation, striking up a strong partnership with Derrick White .\nIn a recent interview with Melissa Rohlin of Fox Sports, Holiday discussed his new surroundings, why he believes the Celtics are the “best situation” for his goals, and how he sees the current point of his career.\n“I think probably since I got traded that this has been my best situation to win,” Holiday said. “For where I am in my career and what I want to do, and the goals I want to reach, I feel like this team is on the same path. So, this is definitely, in my opinion, the best situation.”\nHoliday has been an ever-present for the Celtics to begin the season. He’s played in 27 games, averaging 13.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 4.9 assists, shooting 46.6% from the field and 41.9% from 3-point range.\nCeltics Lab 233: Boston beats the Lakers on Christmas Day, and making sense of trade rumors with Bobby Krivitsky https://t.co/GzzNf981pe via @thecelticswire pic.twitter.com/H9HizoNJAM\n— The Celtics Wire (@TheCelticsWire) December 26, 2023\nBoston currently holds one of the best records in the NBA and is returning from a four-game road trip where they went 3-1, including a Christmas Day victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Holiday addition has elevated the Celtics’ overall skill level and has ensured they have enough talent and versatility to be seen as genuine championship contenders this season.\nListen to the “Green With Envy” podcast on:\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3DoLhYK\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3Oj4dhD\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3K8MbvY\nMore .News Celtics' Al Horford on staying healthy on the road Previewing the Detroit Pistons game and looking back on Boston's West Coast swing Boston's Derrick White not sweating his All-Star buzz\nFollow all of your favorite New England teams at Celtics Wire and Patriots Wire !",
