  "text": "The Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) has made significant progress throughout the year 2023. The organisation has successfully ventured into new geographies while maintaining robust business growth. During the last 12 months, IRS enlarged its fleet by adding more than 5 million GT and expanding its global reach with new customers from Middle East, Europe & Asia Pacific.\nIRS has been closely associated with key technology demonstration projects in collaboration with various Indian shipyards. The projects include hydrogen fuel cells, autonomous vessels, as well as a remote-controlled vessel. All projects are in advanced stages of construction and expected to be completed by early to mid-2024.\nAs part of IRS’ commitment in providing efficient and environmentally friendly propulsion solutions, it has been selected by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to provide classification services for six hybrid electric catamarans with Lithium-Titanium Oxide (LTO) batteries and diesel generators in a hybrid mode to power propulsion motors and other systems aboard the ships. IRS is also working with a Europe based owner for classification of a methanol dual fuelled ship to be constructed in India.\nIRS has updated its ‘Rules for Construction and Classification of Indian Naval Ships in the year 2023 which includes the most recent IMO/IACS requirements, as well as military design features. This year saw the launching of two Diving Support Vessels, two Diving Support Crafts, four ASW-SWC vessels, successful delivery of first Survey Vessel Large, INS Sandhayak, and five specialised barges for carriage of Missiles, Torpedo and Ammunition.\nAs a testimony of growing confidence of shipyards in the technical and professional competence of IRS, Cochin Shipyard is building six New Generation Missile Vessels, GSL will build seven New Generation Naval OPVs, Floating Dock for Sri Lankan Navy, GRSE would be building four New Generation Naval OPVs, HSL building five Fleet Support Ships and L&T building three Cadet Training Ships all under IRS Classification. The organisation is also involved with various new construction projects of Indian Coast Guard including eight Fast Patrol Vessels and two Pollution Control Vessels. IRS has also demonstrated technical capabilities to carry out stealth studies of Naval vessels which were previously done outside the country.\nTo achieve digital transformation and improve operational efficiency, IRS entered a strategic partnership with Dassault Systèmes to use virtual twin technology. The Dassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform will enable IRS to enhance and implement data-driven decision-making processes across a variety of stages, including concept design, engineering, integrated operations, and maintenance. The platform will also facilitate vessel lifecycle management, provide digital services through a unified platform, and provide end-to-end digital traceability and is likely to go live by Q3/Q4 of 2024.\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman, Indian Register of Shipping\nIRS participated in key international maritime events, demonstrating its commitment to the industry. It hosted the 6th Singapore Advisory Committee meeting and Customer Meet, apart from a presence at the Sea Asia exhibition during Singapore Maritime Week 2023. During London International Shipping Week in September, IRS organised a round table discussion on ‘Seascape 2030 – Decarbonisation and the Human Element’ with distinguished speakers, as well as a Technical Seminar. IRS MD Mr. Vijay Arora spoke on “Sustainable Ship Design and Construction” at The Maritime Standard Transportation and Climate Change Conference at Abu Dhabi.\nMr Vijay Arora, MD said ’Going forward, IRS will continue to focus on enhancing fleet quality, strengthen surveyors’ capability through regular training and expand its presence in new geographies. It is our steadfast commitment to excellence, quality, and maritime safety that gives us an unrivalled reputation.’\nMr Arun Sharma, Executive Chairman of IRS said: “In 2023, IRS saw remarkable growth and reinforced its position as a trusted maritime partner. As we approach 2024, global regulatory shifts will continue to accelerate, particularly in response to IMO emission reduction targets for 2030. IRS is prepared to handle these changes seamlessly as companies intensify efforts to meet these targets. While contributing to global initiatives, IRS also aligns with India’s ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ campaign, solidifying our position as a beacon of reliability for maritime stakeholders worldwide.”\nSource: Indian Register of Shipping (IRS)\n2023-12-29 hellenicshippingnews...",
