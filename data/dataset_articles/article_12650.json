  "text": "CEO of the Year 2023 Finalist: Rich Benenson In 2022, under Rich Benenson's leadership, Brownstein Hyatt posted the highest revenue in the firm's history. Colorado is full of devoted entrepreneurs, business leaders and tech-savvy visionaries who are constantly taking the business world to new heights. It’s no secret that here, at ColoradoBiz, we love the Colorado business community. That’s why, every year, we spotlight the most impressive CEOs throughout our Centennial state and give credit where credit is due — to the forward-thinking minds constantly chasing the next great idea and upholding their business practices to the most purposeful ideals. We’re proud to introduce our finalists for CoBiz’s prestigious 2022 CEO of the Year award. Rich Benenson Managing Partner Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck Denver, Colorado Website: [www.bhfs.com](https://www.bhfs.com/) Under Rich Benenson’s leadership in 2022, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck saw an increase in revenue, growth in attorney and policy professional hiring, new comprehensive wellness and leadership development programs, and expansion of the firm’s DEI program. One of Benenson’s most notable challenges was moving the firm to Block 162, a new 30-story office tower in downtown Denver. The move was the culmination of three years of strategic planning that began in mid-2020. Benenson foresaw that Brownstein’s employees needed a fresh, hybrid office space, one that offered space for in-person collaboration, because a fully remote-working environment wasn’t a long-term solution for a firm that thrives on relationships in a team-oriented environment. Benenson joined Brownstein in 2002 as an associate in the litigation department and has had experience at almost every level of the firm and chaired almost every firm committee. This provides him with unique insight into the many perspectives of employees, allowing him to make informed decisions that serve everyone at Brownstein. In 2022, Brownstein posted the highest revenue in the firm’s history, and it was the No. 1 lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., for all of 2022 and the first two quarters of 2023. One of Benenson’s biggest challenges has been fully incorporating the thriving lobbying practice into a legal framework. As a lobbying practice headquartered outside of D.C. that only established a presence there 30 years ago, there is no other firm that is on the same trajectory to learn from. Benenson has successfully articulated a vision that aligns the firm’s legal and lobbying efforts to offer expanded services to clients. From strategic hires to expand Brownstein’s state government relations capabilities to encouraging a cross-selling mindset among all attorneys and policy advisors, there has never been more synergy between the law and lobbying practices. Attorneys and policy advisers are collaborating to better serve clients and provide innovative solutions. What started as an immense challenge when Benenson took on the role as managing partner has been harnessed into his greatest opportunity.",
