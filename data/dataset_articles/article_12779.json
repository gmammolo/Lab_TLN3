  "text": "Jonny Johnston, 45, went to bed before realising the next day he had won\nA supermarket delivery driver got an early Christmas present – after scooping £3.8million on the lottery.\nJonny Johnston, 45, had just finished his rounds for Tesco when he spotted an email announcing ‘good news about your ticket’.\nAssuming he had won a lucky dip, the father of three went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight.\nBut the down-to-earth supermarket worker kept his news a secret for a week, even completing a click and collect shift at his local store, handing out bags of turkey and trimmings to customers in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, on Saturday, before news of his win spread.\nMr Johnston, who has never been abroad in his life, now plans to take his partner of 25 years, Christina, and their three children, aged 19, 20 and 23, on holiday together for the first time.\nJonny Johnston and his partner Christina Williams celebrate at the Culloden Estate & Spa Hotel in Belfast after winning £3.8million on the Lotto draw\nThe father went to bed and it was only when he checked his phone the next day that he realised he had become a millionaire overnight\nThe supermarket worker then kept his amazing news a secret for a week\nHe said: ‘I’m still in disbelief. This is a dream come true for me and my family. I’ve always worked hard, and this win will allow us to do things we could only ever have dreamt of before. I would love for us all to go to the Caribbean, maybe on a cruise as it sounds and looks incredible. We have never had a family holiday together. I just need to apply for my passport first.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years. Three weeks ago, however, he matched two numbers and won an additional Lucky Dip for the Lotto draw on Saturday December 16. It was the free Lucky Dip line, with numbers 4, 12, 23, 30, 50 and 56, which proved to be the winner.\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing. I just kept staring at the numbers on my account. I thought maybe I had won £38,000 but then there were too many zeros. I passed the phone to Christina for her to check and she was in disbelief too. We both began to think that it was a trick, a scam even. We decided we had better call Camelot and double-check.’\nMr Johnson has played the lottery with the same numbers for more than 20 years\nReferring to the moment he realised he had won, Mr Johnston said: ‘I was sitting on the edge of the bed on Sunday morning trying to make sense of what I was seeing’\nMr Johnston said both him and Christina were in disbelief when they first found out the news\nOnly when the National Lottery confirmed the win did the couple break the news to their children.\n‘The kids were silent at first, looking at both of us in disbelief,’ Mr Johnston added. ‘Then the screaming and shouting started, everyone was jumping around the kitchen, cheering. Seeing as it was still early, we popped the kettle on and toasted the amazing news with a cup of coffee.’\nMr Johnston said he also had his eye on a vintage car and may also buy a new tractor for one of his sons, who works on a farm.\n‘I am incredibly grateful and still trying to wrap my head around it all,’ he said.",
