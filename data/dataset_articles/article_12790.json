  "text": "Choose Cornwall\nCornwall, Ontario – Cornwall Business Enterprise Center is pleased to announce seven successful grant recipients in the spring session of the popular Starter Company Plus program.\nThe Starter Company Plus program provides free practical training for new entrepreneurs interested in start-up support for their business. The 12-week program is open to Cornwall, SDG and Akwesasne residents in the spring and fall. Funding is provided by the Province of Ontario and administered by the Cornwall Business Enterprise Center (CBEC).\nParticipants receive assistance to start, grow or buy a small business which includes training, advice and support provided by CBEC with the help of local industry experts. A limited number of participants are invited to present their new business to the grant panel in order to qualify for a grant. Applicants with the highest scores are eligible for grants, which can be spent on equipment, supplies, marketing and many other business development initiatives.\n“The Starter Company Plus program has proven to be an excellent resource for local entrepreneurs looking to start or expand their business,” said Shauna Baggs of Cornwall Business Enterprise Centre. “It is always a pleasure to see new entrepreneurs take their business idea forward and develop confidence throughout the programme. It is very rewarding to work with such a diverse range of business owners in Cornwall, SDG and Akwesasne and I look forward to seeing all participating businesses succeed.\nThe Fall 2023 session was very competitive, with an initial enrollment of 49 entrepreneurs. After several weeks of hard work, only 14 participants were selected to present their business idea to the grant panel, with seven participants receiving grants of up to $4,500.\nCongratulations to the Fall 2023 Starter Company Plus recipients:\nMelissa St. Louis – Seaway Charters – Your Local Transportation\nBrett Conway – Aminoates Inc.\nRobin Neville – Neville HVAC/R Inc.\nAngela Youngs – Ground Soap\nJudy Read – Celebrate Events\nEmily Miller – Mood Kit\nCurtis Kenny – CKFX3D\nThe Starter Company Plus program has been offered through the Business Enterprise Center since late 2013. To date, the program has assisted 153 businesses and provided $663,000 in grants.\nThe entrepreneurs above and dozens of other small businesses were mentioned in Cornwall Economic Development's 2023 Year in Review report. Please follow this link to view the presentation:\nCornwall in 2023 – a year in review\nNext intake: The application period for the next session of Starter Company Plus will begin on February 1, 2024 and close on February 29, 2024 at 4:00 pm.\nSource: www.cornwallseawaynews.com",
