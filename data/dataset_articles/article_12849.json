  "text": "International travel is expensive enough before factoring in how much mobile carriers charge for data packages, but this aloSIM digital SIM card comes with $50 of data credits and is [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1) (reg. $50). aloSIM saves you the hassle of physical SIM cards; instead, you download the eSIM to your device and keep it forever. Just like regular SIM cards, this one will only work on one device, so if you also want data access on your laptop—or you eventually upgrade your phone—you’ll need a new eSIM. Once you download the eSIM, all you have to do is add a data package that meets your needs. There are over 170 locations available, and a variety of data allowances and time frames to choose from, so you can only pay for what you’re actually going to use. Data doesn’t rollover, though—any leftover data will disappear after the time stated at redemption. One crucial tip for using aloSIM, though: install your eSIM and activate data plans before you leave for your trip. Otherwise, you’ll be messing around with slow airport wifi and running into problems when you should be enjoying your vacation. You can get aloSIM with $50 in travel data credits [on sale for $19.97 right now](https://shop.lifehacker.com/sales/alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50?utm_source=lifehacker.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=alosim-mobile-data-traveler-lifetime-esim-credit-25-for-50&utm_term=scsf-584360&utm_content=a0xRn 3OXJIA2&scsonar=1), though prices can change at any time.",
