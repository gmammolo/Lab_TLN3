  "text": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Bill Belichick’s reputation working with Patriots cornerbacks precedes him.\nRecently\nclaimed cornerback Marco Wilson was excited to join the Patriots this week because of the team’s history at the position. The Patriots have earned players like Malcolm Butler, J.C. Jackson and Logan Ryan a lot of money in free agency by building them up through their defensive system.\n“These coaches are established with building up cornerbacks, and they have that history,” Wilson told the Herald on Thursday. “You have smart guys running the defense, smart scheme so I feel like I can thrive in that.”\nWilson, 24, was waived by the Cardinals on Tuesday. The Broncos and Titans also put in waiver claims, per ESPN, but the Patriots had top priority, so they were able to add him to their depleted cornerback group.\nWilson, who hadn’t played on defense since Week 11, only contributing in the kicking game, said he was not surprised the Cardinals waived him.\n“I just felt like it just wasn’t a fit for me,” Wilson said. “I feel like it just It wasn’t the place for me to thrive as a player and develop as a player. And that’s fine. I think this is gonna be a good place for me to do so.”\nThe Patriots have lost five cornerbacks throughout the 2023 season. Christian Gonzalez and Marcus Jones are on injured reserve, J.C. Jackson is on the non-football illness list, and Jack Jones and Ameer Speed have been cut. That leaves the secondary with Jonathan Jones, Myles Bryant, Shaun Wade and rookie Alex Austin, who didn’t begin the season with the Patriots.\nBased on defensive snaps, Wilson, a 2021 fourth-round pick out of Florida, is now the second-most experienced cornerback on the Patriots’ 53-man roster behind Jonathan Jones. He believes he could contribute quickly.\n“I’m a pretty fast learner and whatever they they need me to do, I’m willing to go out there and get my my hands on the field to help my team,” Wilson said.\nWilson said the Patriots’ defense is similar to what the Cardinals ran in 2021 and 2022 with Vance Joseph as defensive coordinator.\nHe’s happy to play for a coaching legend like Bill Belichick.\n“Established guy, the greatest in the game,” Wilson said. “The best coach in the NFL, so I’m excited to be able to be coached by him and not just watch them beat teams now.”\nBarmore admits was his best: Defensive tackle Christian Barmore was initially reluctant to call Sunday night’s win over the Broncos the best game of his NFL career.\nBarmore sacked Broncos QB Russell Wilson three times in the 26-23 win. One of those was a strip sack, and he also had a QB hit and two tackles for loss.\n“No. Keep going. There were some plays I wish I could have had,” Barmore told reporters Thursday. “And just about keep getting better, keep doing better every game. That’s my goal. Every game do better.”\nEventually, however, he agreed when a reporter asked if him that wasn’t his best game, then what was?\n“I mean, you right,” Barmore said. “Denver, three sacks, that is a lot. I’d say that’s really one of my best, but I like the Chiefs too, especially Buffalo when we first played them.\n“It’s all about doing better than every game I’ve played. That’s my goal.”\nInjury news: Running back Ezekiel Elliott missed practice Thursday with an illness and was one of five players to sit out.\nLeft tackle Trent Brown did not participate for a second day due to illness, though he was present for the start of practice. Safeties Jalen Mills and Jabrill Peppers were out for a second straight day. Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was sidelined by a lingering ankle injury.",
