  "text": "API Commends EPA on Louisiana Carbon Capture Decision: A Step Toward a Lower-Carbon, More Energy-Secure Future 202.682.8114 | [press@api.org](mailto:press@api.org) WASHINGTON, December 28, 2023 – The American Petroleum Institute (API) today released the following statement from President and CEO Mike Sommers on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to grant primacy to the state of Louisiana to advance carbon capture projects: “We commend EPA for granting Louisiana the ability to advance carbon capture projects that are critical for reducing emissions, boosting local economies and strengthening U.S. energy leadership. Louisiana plays a critical role in developing, refining and transporting America’s abundant energy resources, and the state’s commitment to engaging local communities and protecting the environment make it best positioned to accelerate this innovative technology. This is an important step toward a lower-carbon, more energy-secure future.” API represents all segments of America’s natural gas and oil industry, which supports more than 11 million U.S. jobs and is backed by a growing grassroots movement of millions of Americans. Our approximately 600 members produce, process and distribute the majority of the nation’s energy, and participate in [API Energy Excellence®](https://www.api.org/oil-and-natural-gas/api-energy-excellence), which is accelerating environmental and safety progress by fostering new technologies and transparent reporting. API was formed in 1919 as a standards-setting organization and has developed more than 800 standards to enhance operational and environmental safety, efficiency and sustainability. ###",
