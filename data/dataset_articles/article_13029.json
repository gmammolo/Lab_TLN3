Were they? Here's a look back at what happened to each CEO, regulator, official, fintech executive, and expert on the list.\nThough new bank formation slowed somewhat in 2023, with only five de novos opening, the stage appears set for a more active year in 2024 with a number of groups working toward a charter.\nCredit unions have announced 11 deals for banks so far in 2023, five short of 2022's total.\nHeading into the year, U.S. banks were facing pressure to pay higher rates to their depositors. But they could not have anticipated just how important deposits would soon become.\n2023 saw a recovery in ridership and signs of progress for contactless boarding. But there's still lots of work to do.\nWhile much of the attention in next year's election is on the top of the ticket, there are several other important races in 2024 that banks need to keep on their radar.",
