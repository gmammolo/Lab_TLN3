  "text": "(InvestigateTV) — Consumer.gov recommends those who are looking to better manage their money in the new year to start by making a simple budget.\nYou can do so by first writing down all your monthly expenses to get a good picture of where the money goes.\nOnce your monthly needs are known, you can then choose a straightforward plan to stay on track.\nOne popular plan is called the 50/30/20 budget. It makes room for both needs and wants and is simple to understand and implement:\n50% of take-home pay covers needs like housing and groceries 30% covers wants, like dining and travel 20% covers savings and debt repayment With this plan, consumers know where their money is going plus it allows for a little fun.\nAny monies unspent or received unexpectedly, like a gift or a bonus, can be funneled into savings and investments.\nCopyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc.
