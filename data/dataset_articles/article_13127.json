  "text": "Non-profit organizations can participate in the Employee Retention Credit, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per location. This program has not expired; you can still claim it even if you took PPP. Unfortunately, many are still missing out. Organizations impacted by government orders or those with decreased revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic may be eligible for the Employee Retention Credit of up to $26,000 per employee. This must-attend webinar will help non-profit organization leaders, operators, and management learn if they qualify for the credit and explain how to navigate it. Attendees will learn: – The most up to date information from the IRS regarding ERC and what it means for you. – Qualification criteria and requirements for non-profit organizations seeking to claim ERC. – How a large non-profit organization was able to successfully navigate the ERC program and uncover an impactful refund. – Key considerations to keep in mind when filing for the credit. – How to ensure you’re protected when filing.
