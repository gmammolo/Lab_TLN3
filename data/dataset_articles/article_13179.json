  "text": "Our take: The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card offers 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), with no annual fee, making it lucrative for small businesses. However, businesses exceeding the $50,000 spending cap per calendar year will earn a reduced cashback rate of 1% on the remainder, and it may offer fewer perks compared to some other business credit cards . Card type: Business To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is designed to simplify and reward everyday business spending. It boasts a generous welcome bonus of $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership. Plus, earn an additional $250 statement credit after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. Beyond this welcome bonus, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). One of its key highlights is the absence of an annual fee, making it an attractive choice for businesses looking to maximize rewards without incurring additional costs. Its cash-back rewards structure is also ideal for those who want to earn rewards without researching the best way to use them. Cashback is simply deposited as a statement credit, eliminating the need to figure out the best redemption option. Moreover, the card extends various benefits beyond its cashback rewards, including secondary rental car insurance , access to the Amex Global Assist hotline, extended warranty and purchase protection. Cardholders can also take advantage of Amex Offers, which provide discounts and savings opportunities with select merchants. The combination of its simple rewards system, lack of an annual fee and practical perks makes the American Express Blue Business Cash Card a solid choice for businesses seeking a no-frills yet rewarding credit card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is an excellent fit for small to mid-sized businesses looking for simplicity and value in their credit card rewards. It caters well to businesses with diverse spending needs, offering a flat 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%), eliminating the hassle of dealing with rotating categories or complex redemption processes. This card provides a straightforward and cost-effective solution for entrepreneurs and business owners seeking a streamlined approach to earning rewards on everyday operational expenses. Overall, the Blue Business Cash Card is a solid option for those seeking uncomplicated yet rewarding cash-back benefits at no annual fee. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card may not be the best choice for businesses with annual spending exceeding $50,000. That’s because once the limit is reached, the cash-back rate drops to 1%. This may not be as lucrative for businesses with substantial expenses. Furthermore, businesses with significant spending on categories like travel might find better value in a travel rewards card that better caters to their needs. Those who shouldn’t get the Amex Blue Business Cash Card include business owners who either travel internationally or use their cards for spending originating abroad. The card imposes a 2.7% of each transaction after conversion to US dollars, making it a poor choice for this purpose. Lastly, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the best choice for business owners who want to earn flexible rewards that can be maximized for premium award travel. Cash-back rewards can’t be optimized beyond their set value. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card has a straightforward rewards structure. New card members earn a $250 statement credit after you make $3,000 in purchases on your card in your first 3 months of card membership, plus another $250 after spending an additional $10,000 within the first year. While this is quite a steep spending requirement, it’s pretty attainable for most small businesses. In addition to the combined $500 in statement credits, the card earns 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year (then 1%). All other spending beyond this threshold earns 1% cashback. This earn rate is great for businesses that want to earn elevated rewards on all purchases without having to track numerous category bonuses across multiple credit cards. Redeeming rewards with the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is about as straightforward as it gets. Rewards are automatically applied as a statement credit within two billing statements following a purchase. This automatic redemption is great for those who seek simplicity rather than complicated redemption structures. While there’s value in earning points through a program like Amex Membership Rewards, maximizing the full value of these points requires a steep learning curve. Not everyone has the time, patience or desire to learn how best to use these points – even if doing so can open up significantly better redemption opportunities. With cash-back rewards that automatically post as statement credits, there’s no effort required whatsoever. To view rates and fees of the American Express Blue Business Cash Card, see this page If the American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card isn’t quite your cup of tea, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from. We’ve chosen two cards that you might want to consider, which offer comparable rewards: The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express are both small business cards that offer similar reward structures and benefits. Both cards earn 2X rewards on the first $50,000 in spending every calendar year, then 1X after. The Blue Business Plus earns valuable Amex Membership Rewards points, while the Blue Business Cash earns cash back. Both cards have no annual fee and offer a welcome bonus for new cardmembers. The Blue Business Plus offers 15,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $3,000 in eligible purchases on the Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership. The Blue Business Cash is more generous, with up to $500 in cash back. Overall, the Blue Business Cash is great for straightforward cash-back rewards, while the Blue Business Plus is better for earning and maximizing travel rewards. The Capital One Spark Miles for Business is a great alternative to the American Express Blue Business card if you want travel benefits and unlimited flexible rewards. Similar to the Blue Business Cash, the Spark Miles for Business card earns a flat rate on all spending: 2 miles per $1 spent on all purchases, without limits. Cardholders also earn 5 miles per $1 spent on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel. The card also offers a welcome bonus of 50,000 miles if you spend $4,500 in first 3 months. These rewards are worth $500 when redeemed for direct travel purchases or you can transfer them to one of 18 airline or hotel transfer partners for even more value. The Spark Miles for Business has a $95 annual fee, which is waived the first year , presenting a great opportunity to test the card out risk-free for a year to decide if it’s worth keeping long-term . The card also includes a $100 travel credit towards Global Entry or TSA Precheck application fees every four years. Foreign transaction fees are also waived, making this an ideal option for business owners who travel often or spend significantly with merchants located abroad. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card can be a solid choice for small business owners seeking simplicity in their rewards. The card suits those who want to earn elevated cash-back rewards on everyday business expenses without tracking category bonuses or worrying about annual fees. Its 2% cash-back rewards structure can be significant for businesses with varied spending. Furthermore, the card’s $500 welcome bonus is generous for a cash-back rewards card, providing a nice incentive for new cardholders. However, the card’s 2% cash-back bonus is restricted to the first $50,000 spent per calendar year. Beyond this threshold, cardholders will earn just 1% cash back. Thus, the card may not be ideal for businesses with expenses exceeding $50,000 or those whose spending habits fall into specific categories. For example, if you spend substantially on shipping and advertising every year, you might be better off with an Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The card earns 3x points per $1 (up to $150,000 combined) spent on shipping purchases, internet, cable, phone, and advertising with social media sites and search engines. Additionally, if your business involves travel or spending originating abroad, the Amex Blue Business Cash isn’t the most cost-effective choice. The card incurs a 2.7% foreign transaction fee, which negates the value of the cash back earned. Moreover, businesses requiring more extensive travel perks and protections might be better off with a premium business card like the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card requires good to excellent credit, making it somewhat hard to get approved. The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card is a cash-back rewards card for small businesses. The credit limit for an American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card will vary depending on your creditworthiness, income and business history. As a result, the credit limit will vary by customer.
