  "text": "Despite inflation and rising stress about the uncertain state of the economy, Americans are traveling at record numbers, with no signs of slowing down. According to data from Mastercard, global travel grew 25 percent year-over-year from 2022 to 2023, and is now above pre-pandemic levels. On top of that, travelers are increasingly seeking unique experiences, spending 65 percent more this year on experiences.\nAs travel writers, this comes as no surprise. Airports were chaos this year, perhaps more than ever. Everyone, it seems, is looking for an escape—and we're here to help make your next trip one of the best.\nWhy You Should Trust Us Andy Cochrane spends nearly half his life on the road, in airport lounges, sidestreet cafes, noisy taxis, and odd hotels, chasing stories about interesting places and unique people. Moreover, Austa Somvichian-Clausen is a travel journalist, published author, and hospitality entrepreneur.\nAfter years of globetrotting, it’s time for us to give back. Here are our recommendations for the trips you should to take in 2024. We put an emphasis on thoughtful tour operators with an eye on sustainability and community development, as well as adventure travel (it's the Men's Journal way).\nArgentine Patagonia Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, ArgentinaIzzet Keribar&solGetty Images\nWhere to Book: Black Tomato Mitre Peninsula Trek For the intrepid traveler, the Mitre Peninsula in Argentina should be at the top of your bucket list. Incredibly remote and preserved, it’s not the kind of destination you journey to solo, or without scrupulous planning and the right permits. Luckily, luxury travel group Black Tomato is adding the far-flung destination to its catalog in 2024, with a never-before-done expedition as part of its new \"See You in the Moment\" collection of trips. Because the most memorable bits of travel hinge upon the shared experience of an outstanding meal, formative event, special journey, fulfilling challenge, or milestone celebration, these ~30 itineraries are meant to be embarked upon in a group—with family or friends—and categorized by The Meal, The Event, The Challenge, The Journey, and The Celebration. This expedition to the Andes falls under The Challenge and will test your endurance in a thrilling way—whether hiking, sailing, or riding on horseback, staying in nomadic campsites along the way.\nWhat to Do The expedition begins in Ushuai, and what happens next depends on the needs and desires of your group, since Black Tomato expeditions are highly tailored. Helicopter and sail boat transportation could combine with sections of hiking and horseback riding to the tip of Tierra del Fuego, encountering snow-capped peaks, dense evergreen forests, glaciers, and glistening fjords. Extra experiences can also be added, such as history and geography lessons, a private yacht voyage to Isla de los Estados, and flying in a chef for a one-of-a-kind dining experience.\nVal d'Orcia, Tuscany Monteverdi Tuscany is a cyclist's paradise as it's set on a medieval hilltop.Andy Cochrane\nWhere to Book and Stay: Monteverdi Tuscany For those looking for the perfect balance of adventure, relaxation, and food, Monteverdi Tuscany is a top pick.

That means the northern lights viewing potential will basically be off the charts during high season, between October and April. Capturing quality images of this mind-blowing natural occurrence is obviously a must, and a multi-day itinerary from Frontiers North Adventures is centered around exactly that. Bonus: Frontiers is the only tour operator in Canada with B-Corp Certification.\nWhat to Do The trip takes off from Churchill, in the subarctic, where participants are led by a dedicated photo specialist guide, and cruise around in style on all-electric Tundra Buggies™—massive vehicles that transport guests in comfort.

Balinese culture, in the region of Ubud, is a vibrant tapestry woven with intricate rituals, colorful ceremonies, and traditional arts, deeply rooted in Hindu-Balinese spirituality. What makes it truly unique is the seamless integration of daily life with spiritual practices, evident in the ornate temples, elaborate dance performances, and communal ceremonies that showcase the island's profound connection among art, religion, and community.\nWhat to Do At boutique hotel Viceroy Bali, set on the edge of a stunning ridge overlooking the lush Valley of the Kings, visitors next year are able to book bespoke experiences to peek (respectfully) into the unique culture and rituals of Bali.

So, journeying to the charming apine village of Grindelwald, in the Jungfrau Region, is the cherry on top—providing not only cozy accommodations and cheesy ways to warm up (raclette, anyone?), but also adventure opportunities. Bungee jumping from a suspended gondola over alpine lakes is an option, as well as canyon swinging across a scenic gorge as powder falls around you.\nWhat to Do Take your alpine adventure to another level by booking through Outdoor Switzerland, which offers everything from beginner ski lessons to multi-day itineraries. Its Bernese Oberland Haute Route, for instance, includes four days of ski touring in some of the most stunning and remote locations in the world. During your tour, you’ll try your hand at epic glacier skiing by day, and spend nights warming up and celebrating in huts in the Jungfrau-Aletsch UNESCO World Heritage area. It helps that Jungfraujoch, aka the \"Top of Europe,\" is bathed in 365 days of powder every year.\nOkavango Delta, Botswana Wilderness meets luxury in the Okavango.Peter Adams&solGetty Images\nWhere to Book: Natural Selection The Okavango Delta, a unique seasonal wetland area of Botswana known for lush biodiversity, might sound like the kind of place you only get to see through the pages of National Geographic. Once that might've been true, but lately it's been opening up as the frontier for a new kind of safari from thoughtful operators that are rooted in sustainability and a community-oriented approach. One such operator is Natural Selection, which is launching a brand new program in May 2024 within Botswana’s Moremi Game Reserve.\nWhat to Do The program was born from a partnership with Chief Tawana Moremi, the chief of the Batawana tribe—ensuring the safeguarding of the delicate ecosystems while providing opportunities for members of the tribe. Accommodation at the camp can be booked a la carte, or serve as your jumping off point for one of the Botswana-based safaris offered by Pristine Wilderness, with concentrations on anything from conservation to wellness to cycling.\nMore Destinations We Love Scottish Highlands Paul C Stokes&solGetty Images\nWhere to Book and Stay: Vacations by Rail If the crosshairs of luxurious leisure and adventure are where you usually like to find yourself, consider taking this journey by rail through the breathtaking landscapes of Scotland.
