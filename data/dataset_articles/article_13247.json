  "text": "Your buck is likely to take you on a little farther road trip next year. At least that’s the outlook from Patrick De Haan , GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis and one of the most cited experts on gasoline prices.\nAdvertisement De Haan is predicting a 13 cents a gallon drop in regular unleaded gas prices nationwide next year, along with the usual seasonal ups and downs seen every spring and summer. His 2023 prediction fell short by only 2 cents — $3.49 a gallon versus $3.51 in actuality.\nAdvertisement “Those seasonal trends are very well established,” he said. “But all in all, we expect a modest improvement.”\nBusiness Briefing Become a business insider with the latest news.\nSIGN UP Or with:",
