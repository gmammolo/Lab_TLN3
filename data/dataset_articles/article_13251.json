He appeared in 130 games, hitting .307/.356/.525 with 26 home runs, 97 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases. He did this all in a contract year, which is impressive.\nThe Cubs are looking for offense this winter, and Cody Bellinger was one of the most intriguing offensive players last season. If Chicago believes he has found himself again and is willing to spend the money, he would be a great re-signing.\nAll signs are pointing to Cody Bellinger rejoining the Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates v Chicago Cubs Cody Bellinger is the top-rated positional player on the open market. He is coming off a year where he bet on himself and had fantastic results with the Cubs for the 2023 season.\nChicago has exciting players like Christopher Morel and Pete Crow Armstrong. They should have an excellent opportunity to make a noise in the National League Central.\nThere is no denying that Bellinger was the team's best player last season. That is something they likely will not want to give up. However, they must dish out big-time money to re-sign the slugger. He is expected to receive a contract upwards of $200 million.\nExpand Tweet With the Toronto Blue Jays signing Kevin Kiermaier just days ago, all signs lead to Bellinger staying with the Cubs. This would be Chicago's biggest offseason signing if they were to make a deal with Bellinger.\nClick here for 2023 MLB Free Agency Tracker Updates.
