  "text": "[TXB](https://txbstores.com/), a customer-oriented convenience store chain with over 48 locations in Texas and Oklahoma, participated in holiday initiatives to give back to the local Lake Travis-area community. The gist The Bee Cave TXB, located at 15701 Hwy. 71, was one of the leading sponsors for this year’s [Bee Cave On Ice](https://www.beecavetexas.gov/residents/culture/events___activities/rink)at the [Hill Country Galleria](https://www.hillcountrygalleria.com/event/bee-cave-on-ice/2145578343), according to a news release. According to the news release, TXB hosted two exclusive nights for the Bee Cave on Ice Foster Family Nights to support local foster families. TXB partnered with Austin Angels on Dec. 5 and Foster Village on Dec. 12. The Bee Cave on Ice Foster Family Nights included visits with Santa Claus where each foster child was given a gift as well as ice skating and festivities at no cost. TXB also extended support for [Lake Travis ISD](https://www.ltisdschools.org/)Elementary Spirit Nights, where they distributed cookies to the first 50 students at each event, according to the news release. Coupons for free TXB food and drinks were also distributed at every event. What else? TXB has given back to the community in other ways, including: - Raised $904,000 for local [Texas Court Appointed Special Advocates](https://texascasa.org/), or CASA, chapters including CASA of Williamson County, CASA of Bell County and Hill Country CASA - Partnered with [ExxonMobil’s Education Alliance](https://www.exxon.com/en/educational-alliance)grant program, which awarded $500 donations to 38 schools across Texas and Oklahoma in need of instructional support “TXB’s motto is to ‘Leave ‘Em Better,’ and that’s exactly what we do for the communities, team members and guests we serve,” CEO of TXB Kevin Smartt said. “We take great pride in being a Texas company and catering to our customers and neighborhoods with locally crafted goods. Giving back to the communities we serve is an honor, whether it’s as simple as donating water and food at local events or donating nearly $1 million for local Texas CASA chapters.”",
