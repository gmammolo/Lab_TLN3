  "text": "Lionel Messi wins record eighth Ballon d’Or after World Cup glory with Argentina\nThe impact of Lionel Messi's landmark move to Inter Miami has been laid bare after the club was awarded special dispensation for a third-kit by MLS. The Herons were handed the rare opportunity to produce a second change strip after sales of the team's jerseys topped the 100,000 mark.\nRelated articles\nCristiano Ronaldo shows his true colours with Lionel Messi ahead of last dance\nMan Utd flop gets phone call from Messi to persuade him to sign for Miami The sensational arrival of the Argentine superstar stateside was accompanied with an unprecedented response by the American public during 2023. Not only was Messi afforded a reception often reserved for rock stars across the country during away trips with his new club, but jerseys bearing his name sold in staggering numbers.\nShirts adorned with the World Cup winner's iconic No.10 fast became a must-have fashion item in the US as fans and A-Listers alike turned out in their droves to watch the legendary forward. During his first few months at DRV PNK Stadium, household names including Kim Kardashian , Selena Gomez and LeBron James witnessed him in action.\nNow, the incredible effects of 'Messi mania' are quickly becoming clear, with MLS having granted Inter Miami permissions to produce a special new strip for 2024. According to Footy Headlines , the kit will pay homage to NFL team the Miami Dolphins in terms of its colour scheme.\nInter Miami shirts have proven overwhelmingly popular with fans around the world (Image: Getty) This potential nod to the iconic two-time Super Bowl winners could well prove a crossover hit for the David Beckham -owned MLS franchise. Fellow MLS teams LAFC, LA Galaxy, Kansas City and Portland Timbers will also be afforded the privellege of having a third-kit next term.\nThe Dolphins famously play in turquoise, alongside orange and white piping - a stark departure from Vice City's usual pale pink strip. Still, a kit which pays more than a subtle tribute to another true Floridan sporting institution could have appeal both locally and internationally.\nThe achievement of selling in excess of 100,000 jerseys demonstrates the cultural impact of Messi's move to the US in the space of less than six months. In fact, sales of the Herons' famous pale-pink shirts set new records as they outstripped that of Tom Brady jerseys upon his switch tothe Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.\nDon't miss...\nBarcelona squad's 2014 food requests resurface including Nutella sandwich [LATEST]\nInter Miami complete Luis Suarez signing as David Beckham speaks out on deal [LATEST]\nNovak Djokovic’s record breaking 2023 snubbed as baseball star secures award [LATEST]\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial\nMoreover, Tor Southard, the senior director of Adidas' football section, also informed the New York Times that orders reached the 500,000 mark in the aftermath of Messi's announcement of his move to Miami in the summer. This figure is higher than that achieved by Manchester United , Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Arsenal in the same period.\nOn top of this, Miami shirts also struck a chord with consumers from a fashion perspective with Vogue Magazine including the jerseys among the top must-have items of the year. They acknowledged that the ongoing clamour to own jerseys bearing Messi's name demonstrates his unique star power.\nExplaining their choice, Vogue said: \"Immediately following the Messi announcement, the generic Inter Miami jersey, in an unexpected shade of un-Barbie pink, sold out, giving rise to a rich bootleg industry. Now, nearly five months later, the official Messi jersey, sporting his number 10, remains wait-listed in most sizes on the Adidas website.\"\nRelated articles Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to face off in final chapter of rivalry Tottenham could sell Barcelona's 'Messi replacement' due to Chelsea U-turn Lionel Messi thinks Tottenham have ‘best in the world’ and their own Luis Suarez Lionel Messi's historic World Cup shirts sell for £6m but miss out on record Man Utd exit close as Arsenal want Inacio and Chelsea eye 'next Messi'",
