  "text": "LYNNWOOD, Wash. — A small bakery in Lynnwood only sells homemade pies – quite literally.\nRumbly in my Tumbly Pie Co. is a one-woman business run out of a renovated third-car garage at Shannon McDowell’s home.\n\"I'm a pie person, through and through,” McDowell said. “That's what I want for my birthday every year. My dad made the best homemade apple pie in the entire world.\"\nShe now shares that recipe - and many more of her own – from her micro-bakery named in honor of Winnie the Pooh.\nLaunched in 2021, Rumbly in my Tumbly asks customers to pre-order their pies of choice and pick them up from a service window (or from small refrigerators outside the window, if McDowell isn’t home.)\nShe's the owner, lone baker and solo scheduler.\n\"I like working alone. It's peaceful and quiet until my kids get home,” McDowell said.\nThough it’s a tiny operation, McDowell makes hundreds of pies a year for both new and regular customers who often give her 5-star reviews online.\n\"The crust is absolutely the key. You have to hand-roll it out, you have to use tons of butter, you have to keep everything cold,” McDowell said.\nAmong her top sellers in the fall? A cinnamon roll apple pie, made with fresh, hand-peeled apples and topped with tiny cinnamon roll pie crusts.\nSeasonal fruit pies are also popular.\n\"My key lime pie (has) fresh-squeezed juice, fresh squeezed zest, and really good graham cracker crust,” McDowell said. \"I probably sell more peach pies between May and September than any other flavor the rest of the year.\"\nAt Halloween time, customers crave the one pie McDowell doesn't love - at least, not visually. It has a scary face baked on top.\n\"I sell like 100 of them every October. It's insane how many people want those, they're so gross,” McDowell said, laughing. “I don't understand it, I couldn't eat it.\"\nWhatever customers choose, McDowell strives to bake pies with the kind of care that sparks nostalgia.\n\"My favorite compliment that I get is when people say it tastes like the pie their grandma used to make,” she said.\nRumbly in my Tumbly pies can be pre-ordered online. McDowell also connects with customers on\nRumbly in my Tumbly Pie Co. is located at 3502 172nd St SW in Lynnwood.\n[KING 5's Evening](/evening) celebrates the Northwest. Contact us:",
