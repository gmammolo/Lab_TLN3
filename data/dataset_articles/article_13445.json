These supplements, available in various formulations and tailored to address specific health conditions or deficiencies, play a pivotal role in meeting the diverse dietary needs of individuals globally. Stringent regulations governing their production, labeling, and distribution ensure that consumers receive products that meet high-quality standards, further bolstering trust and demand in the market.\nGet Sample Copy of the Report\nUnderstanding Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement\nOral clinical nutritional supplements are specialized products designed to provide targeted nutrients in a convenient form for individuals who may have difficulty meeting their dietary requirements through regular food intake alone. These supplements come in various forms such as liquids, powders, capsules, or gels and are formulated to address specific nutritional needs or health conditions. These supplements are formulated to support various health conditions or deficiencies. For instance, there are formulations specifically designed for elderly individuals to support bone health or cognitive function, while others might focus on aiding digestion or managing metabolic disorders.\nGlobal Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market Key Highlights\nIn 2022, oral clinical nutritional supplements were highly prescribed for malnutrition. In 2022, it was predicted that 149 million children under the age of five were stunted (too short for their age), 45 million were wasted (too thin for their height), and 37 million were overweight or obese. Thus to overcome these health issues oral clinical nutritional supplements play a crucial role in managing malnutrition by providing concentrated and readily available nutrients to individuals.\nSpeak to our analyst in case of queries before buying this report\nThe aging population across many regions has also significantly contributed to the expansion of this market. With advancing age comes an increased need for specialized nutritional support to address age-related health concerns. For instance, according to a research, the number of individuals aged 60 and more in Asia is predicted to more than quadruple, from 535 million in 2015 to 1.3 billion in 2050. With around 4.7 billion people living in Asia - almost 60% of the world's total - the worldwide trend towards an ageing population is projected to have a substantial influence. Malnutrition is more frequent in elderly individuals, and with one-fifth of the Asian population expected to be over the age of 80 by 2050, the issue is projected to become a significant burden on the healthcare system in the future years.\nNorth America had the highest share in the oral clinical nutritional supplement market in 2022. North America especially United States has a relatively high prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus oral clinical nutritional supplements play a crucial role in managing these conditions and aiding in recovery, contributing to their widespread use.\nKey Developments in the Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market\nIn December 2023, Roche has announced a formal merger agreement to acquire Carmot Therapeutics, Inc., which has a research and development portfolio that includes clinical stage subcutaneous and oral incretins for the treatment of obese individuals with and without diabetes.\nRequest for customization to meet your precise research requirements\nKey Companies in the Global Oral Clinical Nutritional Supplement Market:\no Abbott\no Amway\no Baxter\no Bayer AG\no Cargill, Incorporated.\no Danone Nutricia\no Lactalis Nutrition Santé\no Mead Johnson & Company, LLC.
