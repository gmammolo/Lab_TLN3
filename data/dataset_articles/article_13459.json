Refinery, Chemicals and Power Generation sectors were the best performing sectors in 2023 as their market cap increased by 88 percent, 73 percent, and 65 percent respectively, an analysis report of Topline Securities said.. On the other hand, Property, Modarabas, and Textile Spinning sectors remained the worst performing sectors posting decline of 24 percent, 11 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively in 2023, the report added.
