  "text": "📆 Thursday, January 4th 🎟 $20 📍 El Corazón: 109 Eastlake Ave E, Seattle What Taylor Swift (and Beyoncé) have done for the economy this last year with their tours might have kept us out of a recession. That’s a cheeky thing to say, but also the Taylor Swift Impact created an economic boost on 53 nights in 20 locations—a [ five-month, five-billion-dollar shift](https://www.ustravel.org/news/taylor-swift-impact-5-months-and-5-billion). Then there was the “ [Swift Quake](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/entertainment/taylor-swift-seismic-activity/index.html),” where fans triggered an earthquake in Seattle. With that kind of momentum, consider starting 2024 with the touring Tay Tay Dance party at El Corazón in Seattle’s Cascade neighborhood. Join DJ Swiftie for a two-hour party “Taylor-made” for Swifties. Expect hits from every era—Lover, Fearless, Evermore, Reputation, Speak, Now, Red, Folklore, 1989, Midnights, and whatever else I’m forgetting. This all-ages event includes a laser show to accompany the setlist, which spans Swift’s almost 18-year career and ten studio albums. Whether a fan or hater, Swift is so damn honest you can’t help having at least a little admiration. Dance tip: Try Taylor’s signature dance move, [The Mom Croon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdaEBbqL5V4&ab_channel=TaylorSwiftVietnamFC), which is about feeling IDGAF because the beat has you caught up. Let go and succumb to the lavender haze. 💌 Be Our Pen Pal! Find out what’s happening in Seattle by [subscribing to our newsletter](https://theticket.seattletimes.com/newsletter/).",
