  "text": "A recent Arizona Daily Star editorial states extractive industries are relics of the past, which are no longer required to achieve our goal of a clean economy. However, it failed to acknowledge the simple fact that products of mining are not only essential for our modern lifestyle, but also help to insure America’s continued prosperity. We use products from mining in our homes, businesses and routine daily activities. This is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Those who demonize mining refuse to recognize industry’s efforts to resolve environmental issues resulting from historical mining activities as well as its development of new technologies and mining practices that minimize negative impacts from current and future operations. Improvements can be made to further reduce many of its undesirable impacts. Today’s mining professionals are working hard to make this a reality. We welcome constructive advice from all stakeholders on how to responsibly meet our nation’s demand for mined products.
