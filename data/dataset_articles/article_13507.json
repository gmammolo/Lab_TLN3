  "text": "Eateries in Uttarakhand to stay open 24×7 as tourists pour in for New Year\nThe Uttarakhand government announced on Tuesday that all eateries in the state can now stay open 24×7 considering the New Year festivities. A notice issued by Uttarakhand Chief Secretary Meenakshi Sundaram said numerous tourists have been coming to the state ahead of the new year and the eateries are being kept open round-the-clock for their convenience.\nThe state government also granted permission for the people working in such establishments to work both day and night shifts under certain conditions.\nPeople from across the country have been flocking to the northern states to celebrate the Christmas and New Year festivities. Heavy traffic jams were reported in Himachal Pradesh’s Shimla and Manali on Christmas Eve and hotel occupancy in the two places was reportedly between 80 and 90 per cent.\nHimachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu on Tuesday said if police find drunk tourists, they would be dropped at their hotels instead of sending them to jail.\nHe added that over 30,000 tourists visited the state and the state government has implemented special measures to take care of them.",
