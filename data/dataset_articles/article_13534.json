  "text": "The leading smart contract platform by volume is seeing a rise in price after its co-founder shared a proposal to simplify its proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. In a new thread, Ethereum ( [ETH](https://dailyhodl.com/currencies/ethereum/)) co-founder Vitalik Buterin [releases](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1740066206185611594) his proposal on how to improve the top altcoin’s blockchain, saying that it would make the proof-of-stake system “considerably simpler and lighter.” In the [proposal,](https://ethresear.ch/t/sticking-to-8192-signatures-per-slot-post-ssf-how-and-why/17989) Buterin says that the upgrade would boost decentralization and allow regular individuals to partake in staking. However, he notes that the proposal comes at a high cost. “This approach requires the Ethereum chain to process a huge number of signatures (~28,000 today; 1,790,000 post-SSF [single slot finality]) per slot, which is a very high load. Supporting this load entails a lot of technical sacrifices.” According to Buterin, Ethereum’s centralization works against it because if it were to suffer an attack, it would cost the network about 9 million tokens, or $20 billion. “If a 51% attack takes place [on Ethereum], a large fraction of the entire attacking validator set has their deposits slashed. The cost of an attack is at present around 9 million ETH (~$20 billion), and that assumes network synchrony breaks in a way that maximally favors the attacker. I argue that this is a high cost, but it is too high a cost, and we can afford to make some sacrifices in the matter… This is why I advocate a moderate solution: one that makes some sacrifices on validator accountability, but still keeps the amount of total slashable ETH quite high, but in exchange gets us most of the benefits of a smaller validator set.” Buterin concludes that the optimal number of signatures to process per slot for ETH is 8192 as it would make it “much easier for anyone to run a consensus client, and users, staking enthusiasts and others would be able to immediately work off of that assumption.” After the announcement, the price of Ethereum jumped to $2,442. However, it has since stabilized and is trading for $2,370 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.Don't Miss a Beat – [Subscribe](https://dailyhodl.com/join-the-daily-hodl-email-list/)to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check [Price Action](https://dailyhodl.com/crypto-markets/) Follow us on [Telegram](https://t.me/thedailyhodl) Surf [The Daily Hodl Mix](https://dailyhodl.com/daily-hodl-mix) [Check Latest News Headlines](https://dailyhodl.com/news/) Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
