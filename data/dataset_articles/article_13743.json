  "text": "At age 36, Dwight Howard last played with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021-22, averaging 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds in around 16 minutes per game.\nApparently, Howard hasn’t officially retired. Or, well, thinks there’s a place he could play. And, not does he want to play, but he wants to bring along some of his friends.\nHoward offered a plan to fix the Detroit Pistons on his X account this week, saying that he, and other former players could “\nwin them some games.”\nHe named John Wall, who played in 34 games with the Los Angeles Clippers last season, DeMarcus Cousins, who played 31 games for the Denver Nuggets in 2021-22, Michael Beasley, who hasn’t played since 2019 and Isaiah Thomas, who played in 17 games for the Charlotte Hornets in 2021-22.\nInjuries, poor play have derailed players Dwight Howard suggested\nThe\nPistons have tied the NBA record for the longest losing streak in an NBA season. They could break the record for longest total losing streak on Saturday.\nHoward says the guys he suggests could end that.\nWhile this group had success in the NBA, most of them have dealt with major injuries and all are close to if not completely past their prime.\nWall has played in 147 games since 2018. Cousins who has had ACL and achilles issues, recently agreed to a deal\nwith the Taiwan Beer Leopards.\nThomas has played in 47 games since the 2019-20 season. Beasley signed with the Brooklyn Nets in July 2020, but the contract was voided because he didn’t pass the physical.\nHoward is dealing with\na sexual assault lawsuit in Georgia that has been filed against him.",
