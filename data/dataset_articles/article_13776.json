  "text": "'He cared about people': Milwaukee businesses reflect on Herb Kohl's patronage MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- The Milwaukee County Historical Society is honoring the life of Herb Kohl this week after his [passing on Wednesday,](https://www.cbs58.com/news/herb-kohl-former-bucks-owner-and-us-senator-dies-at-age-88) illuminating his name in their window with historic city hall lights. Part of what made Herb Kohl special figure in Wisconsin was his pride for Milwaukee, and his love for locals. Many folks met the senator over the years, and shared conversations with him at different places across the city. \"He was very humble, and he wasn't very flashy,\" said Joseph Klosowski, manager at Ma Fischer's diner. That's how locals who encountered former senator and Bucks owner remember him. \"He was very personable, even though he was kind of quiet,\" said Michael Price, co-owner of Benji's Deli in Shorewood. Kohl was a regular at several spots across the Milwaukee area. During his time with the Bucks, he went to the Milwaukee Athletic Club every day. \"He was a swimmer. He loved to come in and swim,\" said member services director, Brad Schendel. As a longtime employee, Schendel got to know Kohl well. \"I mentioned to him that I was going to Washington D.C., and he said when I get there to give him a call, so I did that, and he arranged with him a private tour of the US Capitol,\" Schendel recalled. Another daily stop: Ma Fischer's diner on Milwaukee's east side. \"He would come in early in the morning, like 4:00 a.m., or later on in the evening, but every day,\" Klosowski said. The manager recalls Kohl would always order a chopped salad or French toast. \"He'd always end it with a scoop of ice cream and some chocolate syrup,\" Klosowski remembered. He also invested in young employees' futures. \"For a lot of the servers he'd write letters of recommendation, or things for getting into grad school,\" the manager said. Until just weeks ago, you could find Kohl almost every Saturday at Benji's deli in Shorewood. Above all, the owner says Kohl was consistent. \"He always ordered the same thing, a hot dog and fries,\" co-owner Michael Price said. \"Herb basically wore the same coat, the same outfit, every time I saw him.\" While quiet, he was always willing to make conversation. \"He would eat, and then he would usually get up, and he'd go around to people, shake hands, and say hi,\" Price said. \"Obviously he cared about the city, he cared about Milwaukee, he cared about people,\" Schendel said. Other spots Kohl frequented were Miss Katie's Diner, and Zaffiro's pizza on Farwell. All employees who talked with CBS 58 remembered him fondly, saying he treated everyone like they were important.",
