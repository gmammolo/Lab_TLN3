This expansion, coinciding with the company's anniversary, reflects a strategic move to embrace a wider academic community. Transition from Legal Focus to Diverse Academic Fields Initially focused on legal education resources, Oxbridge Notes has evolved to encompass study materials across multiple majors. This transition signifies the company's commitment to offering concise, detailed study notes and resources in various academic areas. In tandem with this expansion, Oxbridge Notes continues to support legal education, evidenced by a collection of over 8,000 free samples, including more than 1,600 legal case studies. Opportunities for Student Authors in Various Disciplines The expanded platform presents an opportunity for student authors from any academic background to contribute study notes.
