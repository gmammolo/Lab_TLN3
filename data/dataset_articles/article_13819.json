  "text": "The pound hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly five months amid gathering hopes that the UK will avoid a recession. Sterling climbed to $1.2827, its strongest since August 1, before giving up the gains later in the session. It comes as analysts see further gains for sterling against the dollar next year, with experts at US investment bank Goldman Sachs predicting it could hit $1.35.

But the Bank of England predicts that growth will flatline in 2024. The report was not entirely positive, with a third forecasting that the economy will have shrunk in the fourth quarter of this year. That would imply a recession – defined as two quarters in a row of contraction – as GDP has already shrunk by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. Dan Hanson, at Bloomberg Economics, said the economy will ‘tread a fine line between stagnation and contraction in the first half’ of 2024. *** [Read more at DailyMail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-12907557/Pound-five-month-high-against-dollar-amid-hopes-UK-avoid-recession-year.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490)",
