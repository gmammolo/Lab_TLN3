  "text": "NBKC Bank has high-yield business savings in the form of a money market account. If you’re looking for a good annual percentage yield (APY) rate without the stress of maintaining a minimum balance or coming up with a hefty required opening deposit, then NBKC Bank’s Business Money Market account is a great option. You only need a negligible 1-cent balance in your account to earn 2.50% APY. There’s also no minimum opening deposit, which is one of NBKC Bank’s trademark account features.\nNBKC Bank is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured online bank with branches in Kansas City, Leawood, and Overland Park. You can open an account on the bank’s website.\nPros\n- 2.50% APY\n- $0.01 minimum balance requirement to earn interest\n- Free monthly ATM refunds of up to $12\nCons\n- No branches outside Kansas and Missouri\n- Only incoming domestic wires are free\nFeatures\n- Free NBKC Business Debit Mastercard\n- Limited to six transfers or withdrawals per month\n- Online and mobile banking\n- No fees to deposit checks at the branch or via the mobile app\n- Certificates of deposit (CDs) and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans also available\nHow NBKC Bank Stacks Up With Its Competitors\nAPY\nMonthly Fee\nATM Fee\nMinimum Opening Deposit\nBusiness Money Market\n2.50%\n$0\nNone at NBKC Bank ATMs and MoneyPass ATMs; refunds up to $12 monthly for nonnetwork\n$0\nPrime Alliance Business Savings\n3.85% to 4.25%, depending on balance\n$0\nN/A; no debit card issued for savings\n$0\nLive Oak Business Savings\n4.00%\n$0\nN/A; no debit card issued for savings\n$0\nWhen NBKC Bank Is a Good Fit\n- You want to earn competitive interest: With a 2.50% APY on balances of 1 cent and above and no maintenance fees, you can open a money market account and earn higher interest compared to other banks’ regular business savings accounts.\n- You want access to a wide array of bank products: The bank offers business checking, CDs, and SBA loans.\n- You want to save on ATM fees: NBKC Bank refunds up to $12 per month for transactions made at nonnetwork ATMs. This is why it’s part of our list of the\nbest business savings accounts.\nWhen NBKC Bank Is Not a Good Fit\n- You prefer in-person banking but are based outside of Kansas and Missouri: NBKC Bank only has five branches in Kansas and Missouri—so you can consider Chase, which has branches nationwide. For a brief overview of Chase’s available savings products, see the other products section of our\nChase Business Complete Banking review.\n- You need to withdraw funds from your account frequently: Like the majority of savings accounts, NBKC Bank’s Business Money Market account allows you to make only six transfers and/or withdrawals per statement cycle. You can opt to open a basic business checking account with Bluevine, which offers unlimited transactions and earns 2.0% APY on qualifying balances of $250,000 and less. Read our\nreview of Bluevine business checkingfor more information on how to qualify for Bluevine’s APY.\n- You send or receive international wire transfers often: NBKC Bank charges $45 for sending and receiving wire transfers. Businesses wanting to save on these fees can go for Mercury, a financial technology (fintech) alternative, which offers fee-free wire transfers.
