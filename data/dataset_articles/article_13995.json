  "text": "Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries (RIL) will be among the world’s top 10 business conglomerates, chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday. Ambani however, did not give a timeline for the same. “We are known for disrupting the market through constant innovation and reinvention. We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records,” Ambani said while addressing employees on Reliance Family Day, the birthday of group founder Dhirubhai Ambani.He added that his oil-chemicals-telecom conglomerate is aiming to secure its place among global leaders in digital data platforms and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.“As India races ahead to become the world’s third-largest economy, an unprecedented opportunity awaits Reliance. Reliance can …. and Reliance will … grow to be among the Top 10 business conglomerates of the world. For this, we need to be laser-focused on three things,” he said.RIL is building giga-scale factories for its new energy businesses. In 2023 the company also forayed into financial services.“We have shown the courage to set the bar high and the ability to jump even higher to create new records. This is how Reliance has achieved perennial growth,” Ambani said.Reliance is India’s largest corporation by market capitalization.Ambani said his three key messages for the New Year are to consolidate Reliance’s place among global leaders in digital data platforms and AI adoption, consolidate its place among global leaders in talent enrichment, and secure its place among global leaders in institutional culture.\\\"In the era of digital platforms, data has become a new factor of production along with talent and money. We need to be at the forefront of using data, with AI as an enabler for achieving a quantum jump in productivity and efficiency,” he said.RIL's scrip ended at Rs 2605.80, up 0.75% on the BSE, Thursday. Benchmark Sensex ended 0.52% higher.",
