  "text": "Pakistan, China, Islam Out of DU PG Syllabus? Faculty Raise Concerns Over Proposed Changes\nDelhi University’s panel proposed to remove the post graduate Political science elective courses focused on Islam, Pakistan, and China has triggered the significant controversy.\nDelhi University’s panel proposed to remove the post graduate Political science elective courses focused on Islam, Pakistan, and China which has triggered the significant controversy. The move has split faculty members, some are criticizing it as politically motivated and a threat to academic freedom, while others defend it as a step toward maintaining national relevance and aligning the curriculum with India's strategic interests.\nAccording to news agency ANI, the university’s Standing Committee on Academic Matters convened on Tuesday to review department syllabi.\nAfter the April 22 Pahalgam attack, Delhi University department heads were instructed to eliminate any undue glorification of Pakistan from their syllabi, according to Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh in a statement to news agency ANI.\nSeveral members of the Delhi University faculty have strongly opposed the proposed changes to the postgraduate Political Science syllabus, calling them “forced,” regressive, and politically driven.\nDr. Monami Sinha criticized the move, asserting that eliminating courses on Pakistan and China weakens academic depth and diminishes students' understanding of crucial geopolitical issues. “A comprehensive study of Pakistan is essential,” she emphasized, “as it plays a significant role in India’s foreign policy, and fostering academic scholarship on it is crucial.”\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news and world News on Zee News.\nLive Tv",
