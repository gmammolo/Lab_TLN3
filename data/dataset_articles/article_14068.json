  "text": "Concerned Mom Expresses Frustration Over Teacher’s Poor Grammar in Announcement A concerned mom shared her frustration online after seeing an announcement from a preschool teacher filled with grammar mistakes.\nRecently, Rodilene May Gegantoni, a Facebook user, shared a fellow mom’s post about a teacher’s poor grammar in an announcement. The post quickly circulated on social media and drew various reactions from the online community.\nIn her post, Rodilene pointed out that while half of the commenters believed the original mom was just being picky, the other half agreed that the message from the teacher was poorly written.\nMany netizens expressed concern, especially since the announcement was supposed to come from a professional educator.\nThe original announcement had several grammar issues, such as wrong use of possessive forms, awkward capitalizations, missing punctuation, and unclear wording. Some parts of the message were hard to understand, making it confusing for parents who were supposed to attend a school orientation.\nThe mother who shared the message online questioned whether she was simply overreacting or if it was truly a sign of declining standards among preschool teachers. She admitted that while grammar isn’t the main focus in preschool lessons, communication from a teacher should still be clear, professional, and easy to understand.\nShe also mentioned that with the help of tools available today, like writing assistants or spellcheckers, there’s no excuse for such errors, especially in formal announcements meant for parents.\nWhile the school involved was not named, and it was not the school of Rodilene’s own children.\nThe post emphasizes the importance of clear communication in schools and the level of professionalism expected from educators, even in early education settings.\nHere is the full post:\n“Saw this from a mommy group, and I think I need to share this.\n50% of the comments said maarte si mommy poster a.k.a “pwede na daw” but 50% are really alarmed of the composition of the message/announcement.\nHindi ako maarte or grammarnazi, and I always look at the other side of the story if possible. There is always AI to help you generate the formal message if you can’t write your own thoughts because of busy schedule or too much load sa work. Pero ang off ng message nya.\nPS: No, this is not the school of my kids.”\nThe social media users expressed their reactions to the post :",
