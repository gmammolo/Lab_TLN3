  "text": "Next Article\nBhopal principal files complaint over Azaan sound disturbing students\nWhat's the story\nPushpalata Chouksey, the principal of Bhopal's Hamidia College, has filed a complaint with the government over the sound of Azaan from an adjacent mosque.\nShe alleges that the mosque is built on land intended for the college's science department and its loudspeaker disrupts classes and examinations.\nChouksey has demanded a land demarcation, claiming the mosque occupies space meant for the college's science building, India Today reported.\nPolitical fallout\nClarification on construction site sought\nChouksey has also urged authorities to clarify the construction site of the science block. The Bhopal Collector has reportedly taken note of her complaint and asked relevant officials to investigate. However, Imam Hafiz Mohammad Farooq of the mosque has denied these allegations, claiming that their place of worship is almost 300 years old and built on Waqf land.\nNoise control\nControversy turns political\nFarooq also accused the college of targeting the mosque while ignoring similar noise from a nearby temple.\nHe added that they voluntarily reduce the volume during examinations.\nThe controversy has now turned political, with BJP MLA Rameshwar Sharma supporting Chouksey and citing Supreme Court guidelines on noise pollution.\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court held that, while religious practices are fundamental, the use of loudspeakers for religious activities must comply with noise rules to ensure public peace, health, and privacy.\nPolitical accusations\nCongress MLA's response\n\"No one can claim a fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the sound of his speech with the help of loudspeakers,\" the apex court had ruled. The Congress party has also weighed in on the matter, with Congress MLA Arif Masood accusing Chouksey of politicizing the issue. He said that the mosque committee is already cooperating by controlling volume when necessary.",
