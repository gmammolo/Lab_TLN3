  "text": "Education\nDU’s Decision to Drop Papers on Islam, Pakistan, China Triggers Backlash\nDU’s panel decision to drop questions related to Islam, Pakistan, and China from PG Political Science papers has sparked row. While some members appreciated the move, others called it ‘ideological censorship’. Know details here.\nDU’s Decision to Drop Papers on Islam, Pakistan, China Triggers Backlash\nRecently,\nDelhi University's panel decided to drop alleged postgraduatePolitical Sciencepapers onIslam,Pakistan, andChina. The idea was not welcomed by numerous members. Some criticised it, saying it reflected ideological censorship, while others supported the move, labelling it a step towards making the syllabus \"India-centric and bias-free.\"In its meeting on Wednesday, DU's Standing Committee for Academic Matters instructed the removal of four elective papers — Islam and International Relations, Pakistan and the World, China's Role in the Contemporary World, and State and Society in Pakistan. A fifth paper, Religious Nationalism and Political Violence, is yet to be examined in the next meeting on July 1.\nContradicting the decision, committee member Professor Monami Sinha said such revisions undermine critical thinking and reflect a push to dilute controversial but academically relevant content.\n\"We argued that it is imperative to study Pakistan and China in detail. Ignoring these geopolitical realities would be academically short-sighted,\" she said in a statement.\nShe also raised concerns regarding the removal of references to caste, communal violence, and same-sex relationships in the revised syllabi for Sociology and Geography.\nHowever, Professor Harendra Tiwari, also a member of the committee, supported the changes, calling the syllabus \"agenda-driven\" and lacking in balance.\n\"Why only a paper on Islam and International Relations? Why not on Hinduism or Sikhism? We want a syllabus that serves students and our nation,\" he told PTI.\nAdditionally, he said that the dropped papers will not be restored unless the revised syllabus aligns with an \"India-first\" perspective.\nThe next committee meeting on July 1 is likely to see further debate on the syllabus.\n(With Inputs from PTI)\nDeepali Samaniya author\nDeepali Samaniya is a versatile journalist and content writer with a passion for SEO and a knack for crafting engaging stories.
