  "text": "Delhi University professors divided over removal of papers on Islam, Pakistan, China\nDU's decision to remove the postgraduate papers on Islam, Pakistan, and China has stirred debate. The academic community is split over Delhi University's syllabus revisions.\nIn Short\n- Four elective PG Political Science papers on Islam, Pakistan, China dropped\n- Critics call it censorship; supporters say the move makes the syllabus India-centric\n- Debate expected to continue in the next academic meeting on July 1\nDelhi University faces backlash after its decision to drop postgraduate papers on Islam, Pakistan, and China. It has sparked intense debate in academic circles after its Standing Committee for Academic Matters decided to remove several proposed elective papers from the postgraduate Political Science syllabus.\nThe removed subjects include Islam and International Relations, Pakistan and the World, China's Role in the Contemporary World, and State and Society in Pakistan.\nAnother course titled Religious Nationalism and Political Violence has been held back for review in the upcoming committee meeting scheduled on July 1.\nMIXED REACTIONS TO THE DECISION\nThe move has not gone down well with several committee members. Professor Monami Sinha voiced strong opposition, calling the change an act of ideological censorship.\nShe warned that removing such papers undermines critical academic enquiry, especially at a time when understanding regional geopolitics is crucial.\n\"We argued that it is imperative to study Pakistan and China in detail. Ignoring these geopolitical realities would be academically short-sighted,\" Professor Sinha stated.\nShe also raised concerns over the removal of references to caste, communal violence, and same-sex relationships from the revised Sociology and Geography curricula.\nPROPONENTS CALL FOR AN INDIA-FIRST SYLLABUS\nOn the other hand, some members supported the decision, asserting that the current syllabus was \"agenda-driven\" and lacked balance. Committee member Professor Harendra Tiwari questioned the selective inclusion of topics.\n“Why only a paper on Islam and International Relations? Why not on Hinduism or Sikhism?” as quoted by PTI.\nAccording to him, the committee's goal is to create a curriculum that is \"India-centric\" and unbiased, serving national academic interests.\nTiwari made it clear that the dropped courses will not be reinstated unless they align with an India-first academic perspective.\nFURTHER DISCUSSION AHEAD\nThe topic remains unsettled, and the upcoming meeting on July 1 is expected to see further deliberation on the revised syllabus.\nThe issue has not only triggered a division within the committee but has also raised broader questions about academic freedom, inclusivity, and political influence in higher education.\nAs this debate unfolds, students and faculty await clarity on what direction Delhi University’s curriculum will ultimately take.\n(With inputs from PTI)",
