  "text": "TRIAD — For the first time since 2009, the number of charter schools in North Carolina dropped this past school year.\nAfter the General Assembly removed the cap of 100 on the number of charter schools in 2011, there was rapid growth in the number of schools for several years, but that has slowed in recent years — in 2019 there were 196 schools, and the number dropped from 211 in 2023-24 to 208 this past year, according to the new Annual Charter Schools Report.",
