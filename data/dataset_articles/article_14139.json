  "text": "Transfer Glitch Sends Bihar Govt School Teachers To Missionary Schools, Madrasas\nDPO Kumar Anubhav acknowledged the error and said the issue can't be resolved at the district level, adding that guidance from higher authorities would be sought for correction\nIn an unusual development in the West Champaran district of Bihar, the education department has come under scrutiny following the transfer of some government teachers to private missionary schools and madrasas.\nThe department had issued instructions that all transfers be based on the student-teacher ratio to ensure teachers are allocated where needed. However, several discrepancies have been identified in the recent transfers.\nRecommended Stories\nThe issue surfaced when some teachers reported to a school in Chuhdi Bazar, Chanpatia, only to discover it was a private missionary school named Loyola Middle. This unexpected posting left the teachers astonished.\nSimilarly, the transfer of teachers to madrasas has raised concerns among both the teachers and madrasa administrations. Notably, teacher Preeti Kumari from Bagha-2 and Bhuvan Bhaskar have reportedly been transferred to a madrasa in Majhauliya.\nIn response, teachers Pooja Kumari and Farzana Khatoon lodged complaints with the District Education Office. DPO Kumar Anubhav acknowledged the error and indicated that departmental guidance would be sought to resolve the issue, which cannot currently be addressed at the district level.\nThis situation has provoked anger among many teachers, who claim they have not been posted in any of their preferred schools but rather in remote locations. Teachers were required to provide ten options, considering factors such as illness, spouse postings, and personal preference.\nboard exam results 2025, entrance exams such as\nJEE Mains,\nAdvanced,\nNEET, and more.
