  "text": "India's Best Colleges 2025\nAjit Pawar opposes teaching Hindi from class 1 in Maharashtra schools\nThe state clarified that Hindi would not be mandatory. However, to offer any Indian language other than Hindi, at least 20 students in a class must request it\nAjit Pawar has voiced his opposition to the recent move to introduce Hindi from Class 1 in Maharashtra schools. Speaking to the media in Mumbai, he stressed the importance of allowing children to focus on Marathi from the start of their education, suggesting that Hindi should be introduced only from Class 5 onwards.\nHis comments come in response to a revised directive issued by the state government last week, which proposed that Hindi be offered as a third language in Marathi and English medium schools from Classes 1 to 5. The announcement stirred debate, particularly around the age at which a third language should be introduced in the school curriculum.\nThe state clarified that Hindi would not be mandatory. However, to offer any Indian language other than Hindi, at least 20 students in a class must request it — a clause that has sparked further criticism.\nReferring to a recent high-level meeting on the subject, Pawar expressed concerns about the added academic pressure on young pupils. He remarked that children should begin their schooling with Marathi to ensure they become confident in reading and writing their mother tongue before taking on additional languages.\nHe acknowledged that there is no objection to learning different languages in principle, but emphasised that introducing too many subjects too early can place an unnecessary burden on young learners.\nFollowing the meeting led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, it was stated that the government would reach a final decision on the matter only after consulting language scholars, educators, cultural figures, and political representatives.\nActor Sayaji Shinde also joined the discussion, backing the view that Hindi should not be taught from Class 1. He underlined the importance of giving priority to Marathi in early education, describing it as a language with deep cultural and literary value. Shinde urged the government to reconsider the decision and avoid imposing an extra language on students too early in their academic journey.",
