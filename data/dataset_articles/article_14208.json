  "text": "The shocking state of water in South African schools\nUpdated | By East Coast Breakfast\nA dirty truth has just been uncovered about water across many South African schools!\nWe all know that clean water is a basic human right.\nSadly for thousands of South African schoolchildren, it’s still a daily gamble.\nA recent water testing initiative, launched by the Water Warriors Collective and citizen science group WaterCAN, uncovered some shocking realities about the state of water in our schools.\nHonestly, it’s not the kind of news we want to hear.\nWhat did they find?\nAs part of a month-long nationwide project, pupils at 95 schools in eight provinces were trained to test the quality of their school’s drinking water.\nAccording to WaterCAN and TimesLive, from tap water to JoJo tanks and nearby rivers, the results painted a worrying picture.\nOf the 53 schools who were able to upload their test results, WaterCAN found that:\n43% of water samples were unsafe for drinking due to high levels of bacteria.\n73% of water tanks, relied on by many rural and township schools, tested positive for harmful bacteria, including E. coli.\n66% of river water and 23% of tap water samples also showed unsafe bacterial levels.\nWhile chemical levels like nitrites and chlorine were mostly fine, some schools had concerning phosphate levels and dangerously low pH.\nThis could potentially cause long-term health risks.\nWhy does this matter, you ask?\nWell, it’s not just about drinking water.\nThe lack of clean, safe water in schools affects everything - from the health of pupils to their dignity, focus, and even attendance.\nIn some communities, learners have to carry water from home, relieve themselves in open fields, or go through school days without soap or working toilets.\nIt’s especially tough for young girls during their periods. That’s where water issues start to cross into gender rights and education rights territory.\n“Unsafe water is not just a health issue; it’s an education issue, a gender issue, and a human rights issue,” said Dr. Ferrial Adam, WaterCAN’s executive director, as quoted by TimesLive.\nALSO READ: SA teen signed by Chelsea FC for R17m\nDr. Adam also pointed out that it shouldn’t be up to kids to safeguard their water.\nThis was just a sample of a handful of schools out of over 24,000 nationwide.\nYet it reveals systemic problems that urgently need national attention.\nThis isn’t something we can afford to overlook.\nIt’s time for government, communities, and organisations to work together and turn these findings into action.\nHOW TO LISTEN TO EAST COAST RADIO\n1.
