  "text": "In early June 2025, South Africa kicked off the fifth phase of its Basic Education Employment Initiative (BEEI), aiming to deploy over 200,000 young people across nearly 20,000 public schools. The move is part of ongoing efforts to address deep-rooted challenges in the education sector. While the country seeks to revive its education system amid persistent youth unemployment, progress is being slowed by growing budget pressures. In several provinces, government funds can no longer fully cover essential school services, particularly in disadvantaged areas.\nBy the end of 2024, the South African government admitted publicly that provincial education budgets were no longer sufficient to meet operational needs. The situation is particularly visible in Gauteng province, where some schools are forced to operate without reliable electricity.\nTo cope, many schools rely on generators, with some paying as much as 8,000 rand (about $450) every two days, according to local news outlet Independent Online. At the same time, a shortage of school infrastructure has pushed the government to invest in 453 mobile classrooms at a cost of 207 million rand, reports Sowetan Live.\nControversial Budget Trade-Offs\nThese financial struggles reflect broader national budget constraints. Between 2013 and 2023, South Africa allocated over 331 billion rand to bail out state-owned companies such as Eskom and South African Airways, according to Treasury data. These funds account for nearly 11% of the total education budget during the same period.\nThe support to Eskom, estimated at $13.37 billion between fiscal years 2008/2009 and 2022/2023, aimed to stabilize the country’s power supply amid chronic electricity shortages, according to the 2024 national budget report. Meanwhile, South African Airways received $2.67 billion to stay afloat in a sector hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis and governance failures.\nAlthough these bailouts were justified on strategic grounds—energy security and national connectivity—their impact on education funding has sparked concern. Hendrick Makaneta, an education activist in South Africa, stressed the need for transparency and strict oversight to ensure education funds reach their intended beneficiaries.\nThe budget allocated to education, along with how it is managed, is especially critical given the sector’s long-standing challenges. South Africa’s education system continues to grapple with aging infrastructure, regional disparities, and administrative hurdles, as noted by several independent sources.\nIn response to these pressing needs, the government has launched several initiatives to cushion the education sector from budget shocks. One top priority is improving school infrastructure. An accelerated development program is underway, according to the Western Cape Education Department (WCED). The program targets rural areas, overcrowded schools, and facilities lacking basics like clean water, electricity, or decent sanitation. The goal is to secure minimum learning conditions for all students, despite tight finances.\nAt the same time, the government is moving forward with the Basic Education Employment Initiative, now in its fifth phase. The program trains young people to assist teachers in classrooms and with administrative tasks. This dual-purpose initiative supports both youth job creation and improvements in the school environment. It is seen as part of the broader national strategy to fight unemployment.\nThe state has also launched a territorial planning approach. According to Siviwe Gwarube, provinces are expected to submit school rehabilitation plans with clear targets and deadlines. These proposals must align with Treasury’s push for better budget predictability. The broader goal is to secure public resources for education by focusing on the most urgent needs and promoting equity across regions.\nWhat Future for South African Education?\nSouth Africa’s education challenges mirror issues faced by many African nations. Across the continent, countries are experimenting with innovative strategies to address funding gaps and improve access to education.\nIn Rwanda, for instance, the government has heavily invested in educational technology, building digital platforms to offset physical infrastructure shortages. Kenya has rolled out teacher training programs and public-private partnerships to raise education quality. These examples show that clear policies and strong political will can deliver meaningful progress.\nFor South Africa, revitalizing the education system will depend on sustained political commitment that positions education as a pillar of national development. In a context where less strategic sectors still receive significant resources, the government must navigate complex budget trade-offs carefully.\nStrengthening transparency in education spending is also essential. Establishing strict oversight and accountability mechanisms will help ensure that resources actually benefit schools and students. Senegal’s “Sunu-Budget” platform is one example of how improving public spending visibility can drive better outcomes.\nMoreover, the involvement of local communities and private partners will be vital. Across Africa, grassroots initiatives and NGO partnerships have helped rehabilitate schools, upgrade infrastructure, and provide learning resources. In 2017, Burkina Faso set up school management committees (COGES) to engage diverse actors in improving learning conditions.\nSouth Africa’s situation highlights the importance of sound budget management across strategic sectors. While reform efforts are underway, success will hinge on the government’s ability to strengthen oversight and make education a long-term national priority.\n• Maritime sector faces renewed risks amid military tensions in the Middle East• Blockade fears at S...\nKenya tops African entries in 2025 IMD ranking at 56th globally.
