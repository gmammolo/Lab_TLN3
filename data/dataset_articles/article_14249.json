  "text": "HYDERABAD :They cracked entrance exams, secured admissions, and began planning their future abroad. But for several students from Hyderabad, one mistake derailed everything. Booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, some lost their chance to ﬂy out even after getting visas and ﬂight tickets. Others had to pause midway, attending counselling and awaiting court clearance instead of joining universities. Many were caught during farewell or celebration parties where they consumed cannabis or other drugs. Some were ﬁrst-timers, others occasional or regular users. “I never touched drugs in college. Before ﬂying out for my master’s, I went to Goa with friends and tried hash for the ﬁrst time. I was caught,” said a 23-year-old who had to suspend his plans due to an ongoing police case. Another 25-year-old, headed to Australia, said, “At a party, my friends used my phone to pay the peddler. The police tracked the payment to me.” Drugs disrupted careers These are not isolated cases. De-addiction experts say hundreds of high-achieving students have had their careers disrupted due to drug-related offences. Peer pressure, ignorance of legal implications, and troubled childhoods are some common factors. “Once caught, the biggest dilemma is whether to disclose the case on visa forms, immigration documents, or job applications,” said K Devika Rani, a de-addiction expert who works with the police. She added that many students lose parental support after such incidents, compounding their distress. Legal clearance can take up to a year, with mandatory training and court procedures. Students often miss at least two academic sessions and are sometimes called as witnesses in court to seek immunity under Section 64A by cooperating in the peddler’s trial.",
