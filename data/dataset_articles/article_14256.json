  "text": "A day before the Achievement Test in Kosovo's primary schools, education expert from the EdGuard Institute, Rinor Qehaja, raised serious concerns about the administration of the Achievement Test, comparing it to failures in the Matura Test. In an interview with Ekonomia Online, Qehaja said that the Achievement Test is riddled with abuse, copying, and manipulation that make the assessment invalid and unreliable. \"The Achievement Test in our assessment is not much different from the failure in administration of the Matura Test. On the contrary, we assess that it has escalated as evil in the form of abuses, copying and manipulation that occur by students, which is carried as a consequence that those good or not good students, in each case, present us with results that are not valid and reliable. What we advocate now, since the character of the test is orienting, is that we see it as necessary that the same one does not have weight in the registration for upper secondary schools, but remains in its pure purpose which is to orient students who are in those profiles, which are more suitable for them as skills and to serve as a good guide for a good career choice\", he said. Qehaja proposes that the test should not be weighted in high school enrollment, but should only be used as a guide for career orientation. \"The test structure and questions, no matter how updated, remain essentially the same, in form, organization, structure, and as such we do not expect any changes from previous years. We will have the same results, at a roughly similar level of pass rate, which is also subject to how rigorous the administrators have been during the testing. Generally, what is decisive for students is the number of points: the more points, the higher the probability of enrolling in the schools they want. For these reasons, more importance and proper administration of this test are needed, since at one point, a poorly administered test can very easily turn bad students into good test performers,\" said Qehaja. He asks the Ministry of Education and observers to guarantee fair administration and restore confidence in the process, avoiding damage to meritocracy and fair competition. \"This happens because of mismanagement. They alienate genuine competition and devalue the assessment of good grades that a student has had from lower secondary school. We call on the Ministry of Education to take it seriously and to convey it to observers in order to guarantee us a well-administered process so that it turns into a meritocracy and valid results that serve everyone,\" Qehaja told EO. Tomorrow (Friday), the Achievement Test for ninth-grade students will be held in primary schools in Kosovo, in a process that aims to measure the knowledge and skills acquired during compulsory education.",
