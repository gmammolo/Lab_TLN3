  "text": "CBSE's biannual exams for Class 10 face criticism from educators. (AI Image) NEW DELHI: In a transformative move, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has approved the introduction of biannual Class 10 board exams, starting in 2026. Aimed at reducing student stress and providing multiple opportunities for improvement, the new system will require all students to sit for the first phase of exams, with the second phase optional for those wishing to improve their scores. The best score from either phase will be considered for the final result. This change is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which promotes a student-centered approach to learning and aims to alleviate the pressure of high-stakes testing. However, this shift has sparked strong reactions from educators. While some see potential benefits in the increased flexibility, the majority of principals have raised concerns about the policy's impact on academic calendars, teacher workload, and student well-being. Many fear the new exam system will exacerbate stress rather than reduce it, with extended exam periods leading to burnout for both students and teachers. Others question the practicalities of implementing such a system in schools with already tight schedules. Concerns over academic calendar and teacher workload Several school leaders have expressed concerns about how the biannual exam system will interfere with the smooth functioning of schools. Ms. Sudha Acharya, Principal of ITL School in Dwarka, warned that the extended exam period, from February to June, would leave little room for regular teaching. \"From mid-February to June, teachers will be engaged in conducting exams and grading, which will compromise the time available for regular classes,\" she explained. \"This will impact not just board exam preparation but the teaching of other classes as well.\" Read Also: CBSE Introduces Biannual Class 10 Board Exams from 2026, Retaining Best Score The new system also poses logistical challenges for schools. Teachers, who already juggle multiple responsibilities, will face increased pressure. \"Teachers involved in exam duties also teach classes from VI to VIII,\" Ms. Acharya pointed out. \"This will make it difficult to begin the academic session in April, and may even affect the quality of teaching in lower grades.\" Ms. Asha Prabhakar, Principal of Bal Bharti Public School, NOIDA, echoed similar concerns, stressing that the compressed academic calendar, which already has limited working days, will be further strained by the new policy. \"With only around 210 working days in a year, introducing two board exams will make it even more difficult to maintain a balanced academic schedule,\" she said. \"The emphasis on exam duties will leave little time for teaching, and this could lower learning standards for other classes.\" Increased stress and potential for burnout While the policy is meant to reduce stress, many educators worry that it could lead to even greater anxiety for both students and teachers. Ms. Aparna Erry, Principal of DAV Public School, Gurugram, pointed out that two board exams in one year would extend the stress period from February to May, leaving little room for relaxation or skill development. \"Instead of reducing pressure, students will feel the weight of constant exam preparation,\" she said. \"This prolonged stress could lead to burnout and diminish their overall well-being.\" Read Also: How the New CBSE Class 10 Board Exam System Will Work Starting 2026 Teachers, too, are likely to bear the brunt of the increased workload. Ms. Rashmi Malik, Principal of Salwan Public School, Gurugram, expressed concern over the extra responsibilities teachers would face, noting that the dual exam system would require them to prepare students for multiple rounds of testing, as well as manage the evaluation process. \"This added workload will put significant stress on teachers, who are already stretched thin,\" she said. Financial and emotional burden on families The financial implications of the new system are another point of contention. Many principals believe that the two-exam system could place unnecessary strain on families. Dr. Anupama Mishra, Principal of Sunbeam School Varuna, Varanasi, pointed out that the cost of registering for two rounds of exams, along with other associated expenses like coaching or materials, could be a burden for many families. \"The repeated costs of exam forms, stationery, and travel to exam centers could lead to financial strain,\" she said. Additionally, the emotional toll on both students and their families could be significant. \"Parents will face additional pressure to ensure their children perform well in both rounds, and this could add to the overall stress,\" Dr. Mishra noted. Solutions and suggestions While many educators remain critical of the biannual exam policy, some have suggested alternatives that could better balance flexibility with meaningful assessment. Ms. Malik of Salwan Public School proposed a shift toward online Class 10 exams, which would allow students to take exams anytime after September, with multiple chances to improve scores. \"Rather than two board exams, we could focus on internal assessments for students who don't need the board certification,\" she suggested. Ms. Prabhakar of Bal Bharti Public School also recommended that CBSE reconsider its approach, emphasizing that the goal should be to maintain high educational standards while minimizing stress. \"The priority should be on providing a balanced education, rather than focusing solely on exam results,\" she said. A call for balanced reforms While the CBSE's decision to introduce biannual Class 10 exams is an attempt to reduce stress and offer more opportunities for students, the overwhelming feedback from educators suggests that careful reconsideration is needed. The concerns over teacher workload, academic calendars, and the mental health of students and teachers highlight the need for a more balanced approach to assessment. As the policy moves forward, it will be crucial for CBSE to engage with educators to find a solution that truly supports both academic excellence and student well-being.\nAbout the Author Sanjay Sharma Sanjay Sharma is a seasoned journalist with over two decades of experience in the media industry.
