  "text": "India's Best Colleges 2025\nDelhi University may revise MA Political Science syllabus, drop courses on Pakistan, China, and Islam\nThis move, however, has sparked criticism among faculty members, many of whom fear that such changes could dilute students’ understanding of key international and regional dynamics.\nDelhi University is considering significant changes to its MA Political Science curriculum, with proposals to remove or replace courses that focus on Pakistan, China, Islam, and political violence. Among the courses likely to be withdrawn are ‘Pakistan and the World’, ‘China’s Role in the Contemporary World’, ‘Islam and International Relations’, ‘Pakistan: State and Society’, and ‘Religious Nationalism and Political Violence’.\nThe possible revision follows concerns raised within the academic community and beyond. Vice Chancellor Yogesh Singh reportedly told news agency ANI that after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, faculty members were advised to reassess course content that might be seen as overly sympathetic or glorifying towards Pakistan.\nThis move, however, has sparked criticism among faculty members, many of whom fear that such changes could dilute students’ understanding of key international and regional dynamics. They argue that omitting these topics would weaken the academic study of geopolitics and international relations at the postgraduate level.\nDr Monami Sinha, a member of the university’s Standing Committee, noted that the syllabus underwent \"serious examination\" during a recent committee meeting that reviewed the structure of various postgraduate courses.\nShould the proposed changes go ahead, the responsibility for creating alternative courses will fall to the department’s course committee. Any newly framed content will first need the approval of the syllabus panel, and subsequently, it will be presented to the Academic Council for final ratification.\nThe debate continues within the university as faculty, administrators, and students await a formal decision on the future shape of the syllabus.",
