  "text": "The war on harvard Some postdoctoral researchers at Harvard University this summer are seeing their contracts renewed for three months, rather than the usual 12. Labs are killing their mice to save the $1.40 per day it costs to feed each cage and clean up after. And a Harvard Medical School facility designed to create teensy devices like nanosensors — a resource for researchers on the Cambridge campus and its affiliate hospitals — is shutting down next month after 18 years.\nEach small cut is a way to make up for the $686 million in federal research funding Harvard received last year but cannot count on anymore. Rumblings of an impending deal with the Trump administration to restore funding in exchange for tweaks to university policies do not change the reality on the ground: Right now, Harvard is pulling from a far smaller pool of money for day-to-day operations than it expected, and cuts are rippling through the university, according to interviews with dozens of faculty, staff, and graduate students.\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up Department chairs are drafting memos planning belt-tightening measures. Rumors are spreading about widespread layoffs in the coming weeks. And a research scientist who created an acclaimed database of lost federal funding across the country will be terminated himself in October, unless his grant is somehow re-upped.\nAdvertisement\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the center of undergraduate and PhD studies at Harvard, is largely spared, though it has lost 320 grants, worth about $400 million. And the Harvard Kennedy School is laying off “some members of our team,“ eliminating some office space, and pausing ongoing construction projects, its dean wrote in an email Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nHarvard’s medical and public health schools, which rely on federal dollars to support up to 40 percent of their operations, will bear the steepest consequences. Harvard Medical School also operated in the red for several years before President Trump’s second term.\nThe public health school has already made “deep cuts across our administrative and operations budgets,” according to a schoolwide email its dean Andrea Baccarelli sent in early June, instructing researchers to pause equipment purchases, new contracts, and hiring.\n“Over the next year, we must adapt to a new world,” he wrote. “Our sources of research funding will change. Our commitments to academic excellence and high-impact scientific discovery will not.”\nFaculty at both the medical and public health schools are eyeing the end of the fiscal year next week as a time when more layoffs could come down.\nFaculty at Harvard Medical School are eyeing the end of the fiscal year next week as a time when more layoffs could potentially come down. Craig F. Walker/Globe Staff It’s like no challenge the university has faced before. After the 2008 recession dented Harvard’s endowment by $9 billion, the school trimmed its budgets, pulled back on outside investment, and hit pause on its expansion in Allston. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard avoided widespread furloughs or job layoffs .\nBut this year’s federal funding cuts take away cash, perhaps for good, that Harvard researchers were already promised and had made plans for.\nThe Trump administration teased an ongoing negotiation with the university last Friday for a “historic” deal, but has not provided details. In the future, the federal government hopes to cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by 40 percent . And even if Harvard wins lawsuits to protect its current grants or reaches a detente, there is no guarantee any new federal spending will come its way.\nAdvertisement\nFor many faculty and staff, the focus now is not to shrink Harvard’s workforce and research arm more than necessary. While most of its $53 billion endowment is restricted for specific uses, Harvard certainly has enough in the bank to make payroll, and in May, committed $250 million to extend funding to some projects whose grants were terminated.\nBut even that only covers 80 percent of lab expenses at most until the end of the month.\nWith limited funding, discoveries backed by years of data and trials may be cut short, and the scientific community has raised the alarm about a backslide in the country’s competitiveness on the international stage.\nFor next year, Harvard Medical School has created a plan that patches together $90 million in university funding, $90 million more in reserves from HMS, and a $30 million loan. That will backfill most of the $291 million in lost grants through next June.\nStephen Blacklow, chair of the department of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at the medical school, said that money helps “prevent overcorrection” to the White House’s cuts.\n“These are huge expenses being absorbed by the institution in the short term with the goal of helping existing robust and vital programs get through a year without irrevocable harm,” he said.\nAs for students, Harvard has issued statements vowing to support both master’s and PhD candidates through the end of their programs, but some students said they are already being urged to graduate early by professors who are wary that the funding that supports their work will not come back.\nAdvertisement\nRumblings of an impending deal with the Trump administration do not change the reality on the ground: Right now, Harvard is pulling from a far smaller pool of money for day-to-day operations than it’s used to. Heather Diehl for the Boston Globe Kees Benkendorfer, a Harvard PhD candidate in particle physics, sped up the timeline to present his dissertation from next May to this fall as he hunts for jobs in Canada and Europe. He has spent four years in the Harvard ATLAS program, which explores high-energy particle collisions, but federal support for his work is fading, Benkendorfer said.\n“There is a sense that there is no longer any security with US scientific funding,” he said.\nThen there’s the Harvard staff. A web of grant writers, administrators, and research scientists who are neither faculty nor students play a crucial role at many labs. Most of those positions are entirely funded by federal dollars and outside contributions and are vulnerable with most of that money now gone.\nThe positions are not being eliminated in lump sum or big announcements, but news of piecemeal cuts has dribbled out. Several nonunionized staff members at the public health school have been told their contracts will not be renewed after they end in a few weeks, according to two administrative staffers who’ve been told they’ll soon lose their jobs. They asked not to be identified because they were not authorized by Harvard to speak about the cuts.\nIn the public health school, “cheat sheets” that describe protections for laid-off employees — later reviewed by the Globe — show that Harvard eliminated many benefits it typically provides for people let go after February, when Trump first threatened federal dollars at Harvard. Because of the changes, an administrative staffer said she will not receive severance or health benefits after her contract ends.\nAdvertisement",
