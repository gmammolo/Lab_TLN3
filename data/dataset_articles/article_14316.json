  "text": "OFSTED highlights ‘failings’ in Torbay SEND services\nTorbay’s MP is to press the government for support after the bay’s services to some of its most vulnerable children were criticised in an official report.\nTorbay’s MP is to press the government for support after the bay’s services to some of its most vulnerable children were criticised in an official report.\nTorbay Council and NHS Devon both say ‘systemic reform’ at national level is needed.\nThe report from the watchdog Ofsted said there are ‘widespread failings’ in Torbay’s services to children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).\nOfsted says too many children and young people with Send issues have to wait too long for their needs to be assessed, and the people in charge do not always understand the priorities of their service.\nLeaders have not addressed major weaknesses highlighted at a previous inspection in 2021.\nOfsted says the failings have led to poor communication with families.\nThe report says: “Long waiting times for health assessment, and diagnosis, coupled with gaps in provision, often lead to children and young people’s needs becoming greater while they wait to get the right support.\n“As a result, families reach crisis, and they require more intensive support later. Some parents and carers told inspectors they have no option other than to home educate their child.”\nThe partnership between Torbay Council and NHS Devon which runs the service said it is committed to addressing the issues and an action plan will be prepared.\nA statement from Torbay Council director of children’s services Nancy Meehan and NHS Devon’s director Su Smart said improvement work is already under way.\nThey said: “We have robust plans in place to continue to build on the improvement work we have done to date. We are committed to addressing these challenges locally, but meaningful and lasting improvements require systemic reform at the national level.”\nThe report says there are things being done well for Send children, including early years support through family hubs, the work of the Mental Health in Schools team and the strength of the neurodiversity support programme.\nThe key worker service for young people with autism and learning difficulties is praised, as are school nursing teams.\nThe statement goes on: “We are committed to ongoing improvement across all Send provision and will continue to work with parents, carers and practitioners to develop and strengthen it.\n“Our priority remains the wellbeing and success of our children and young people.”\nThe bay’s Liberal Democrat MP Steve Darling said he would be taking the bay’s issues up at a national level.\nHe said: “I’m sadly not surprised, as we’ve had a lot of cases through my office regarding these issues.\n“We need to ensure that both the council and the health service are doubling down on the efforts to improve the service that is offered to youngsters in Torbay.”\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
