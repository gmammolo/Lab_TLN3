  "text": "Caitlin Clark has biggest flaw in her game pointed out after mixed start to WNBA season\nCaitlin Clark is in the midst of a shooting slump, and it's become apparent that she has a major gap in her game that has been exposed.\nWNBA star Caitlin Clark is currently experiencing a challenging shooting slump, particularly from the right side of the basket.\nDespite some remarkable moments in her sophomore season, including leading the Indiana Fever to an impressive victory over the previously undefeated New York Liberty with a barrage of 3-pointers, Clark's shooting has been off in recent games. She's made just 1 of 23 attempts from beyond the arc in matches against the Golden State Valkyries, the Las Vegas Aces, and the Seattle Storm.\nYet, she still managed to rack up 19 points and 10 rebounds against the Aces. Clark went 0-for-7 from deep against Golden State, followed by 1-for-10 against the Aces, and then 0-for-6 in the win over the Sounders. Her 3-point shooting has cooled since the intense matchup with the Connecticut Sun.\nEx-LIV Golf star playing PGA Tour event had farewell message to Phil Mickelson after exitREAD MORE:\nViktor Hovland makes PGA Tour admission over 'competing against Saudis' at LIV Golf\nAn interesting observation about Clark's shooting struggles is that she's deadly accurate when shooting from her left side. However, when she shoots from the right side of the basket, her field goal percentage dramatically drops by more than half, as noted on the WNBA subreddit.\nThis can be attributed to Clark's tendency to lean into her shot. When she prepares to shoot, both her feet point to the left, which allows her to swiftly change direction on a defender and drive the ball to her left side.\nBut when she takes shots from her right side, Clark has to switch up her technique, messing with her shot power and precision. Due to the need for repositioning for right-sided shots, Clark's jump loses force and her altered stance impacts her accuracy toward the hoop.\nClark's stats show a stark contrast, with roughly 20 percent success on attempts from the right of the hoop compared to nearly 50 percent from downtown on her stronger left flank.\nClark seems aware that her opponents might be exploiting this weakness but remains convinced it's just a temporary dip in performance.\nAddressing the press, she insisted: \"There are going to be stretches that are really good, and there's going to be stretches that aren't as good, and obviously it's frustrating as you want them to go in... I don't feel like it's anything that's off, necessarily.\"\n\"I got to find a way to continue to shoot and remain confident in myself because I know I've put the time in. I don't feel like it's anything that's off necessarily, but yeah, it would've been nice if they went down.\"\nDuring their west coast swing, the Fever recorded a 1-2 tally which coincided with Clark's trio of games showcasing her long-range efforts. In a tough battle against the Storm, she could only contribute six points despite dishing out nine dimes in a 94-86 victory.\nAliyah Boston had a standout performance, leading the Fever to triumph. The former No. 1 overall pick scored 31 points and grabbed eight rebounds, pushing the Fever's record to 7-7.\nThe Fever will next face off against the 4-11 Los Angeles Sparks on Thursday, June 26.",
