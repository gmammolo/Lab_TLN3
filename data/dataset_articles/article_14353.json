  "text": "Over a dozen Oklahoma colleges and universities request tuition hikes\nOver half of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities on Wednesday asked a state governing board to approve increases in what students must pay in tuition and fees for the upcoming school year.\nMark Tygret, vice chancellor for budget and finance for the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, said the average tuition and fee increase request across institutions was 1.9% which equates to just over $121 for undergraduate resident students enrolled in 30 credit hours.\nIn all, 15 institutions are seeking increases while 10 did not request any boosts in tuition or fees, including Oklahoma State University, which will be its sixth year without an increase.\nThe state regents are expected to vote Thursday to approve or deny the requests.\nMany presidents attributed the need for increases to inflation, rising health insurance costs and a desire to provide cost of living raises for faculty and staff.\nUniversity leaders also highlighted the ways they’ve tried to cut costs in other places before requesting increases in tuition or fees. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a press conference earlier this month that he didn’t think tuition increases were necessary as Oklahoma hasn’t seen “all of the efficiency out of our universities.”\nTuition or fee increases were requested from:\n- University of Oklahoma\n- East Central University\n- Northeastern State University\n- Northwestern Oklahoma State University\n- Southeastern Oklahoma State University\n- Southwestern Oklahoma State University\n- University of Central Oklahoma\n- Langston University\n- Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College\n- Connors State College\n- Western Oklahoma State College\n- Oklahoma City Community College\n- Rose State College\n- Seminole State College\n- Murray State College\nThe Oklahoma Legislature appropriated $1.1 billion to the state Regents for next fiscal year, which is about $80 million more than the current budget year.\nOU President Joseph Harroz said he’s requesting an increase to keep up with inflation and universities in Texas and Florida that receive more legislative performance-based funding.\nHe requested a 3% increase, which raises costs about $294 for a full-time student.\n“You’ve seen me up here the last three years, and under our strategic plan … that request will be coming again next year and the following year, with the same goals,” Harroz said of requesting an increase again.\nWhile OU’s “sticker price” for tuition has risen 12% since the 2019 fiscal year, the average amount actually paid by students is down 27% in the same time period when factoring in financial assistance, Harroz said.\nA 2.6% increase, totaling a $225.90 change, was requested by UCO President Todd Lamb.\nThe university is continuing to recover from a budget deficit, and if approved this increase could bring the school close to closing the gap completely, he said.\nThe Edmond school is the third-largest university in the state, but third to last in funding, Lamb said.\nOklahoma’s only historically Black university, Langston University, requested a 3% increase.\nLangston President Ruth Ray Jackson said the revenue generated will provide funding for capital projects spurred by weather-related damage, deferred maintenance and help with inflation.\nThe increase to tuition and fees would cost the average student just over $207.\nOklahoma City Community College President Mautra Jones asked the state regents to approve an 8% increase, the highest boost sought by any institution.\nWhile Jones said the request may seem steep, the community college kept tuition flat for seven years. Even if the increase were approved, the college would remain “within pennies” of being the lowest cost institution in the state, she said.\nThe increase equates to $323.10 for the average student.\nOklahoma Voice is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
