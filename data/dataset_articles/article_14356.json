  "text": "A new set of reports from the Council for Better Education (CBE) shows that Kentucky’s public education system is suffering from a steady decline in inflation-adjusted state funding since 2008.\nThe reports, released to every public school district in the state, indicate that while the SEEK (Support Education Excellence in Kentucky) formula distributes money fairly, the total amount allocated by the state is inadequate. As a result, school districts are grappling with funding shortfalls that affect staffing, class sizes, student services and transportation, according to a news release from CBE.",
