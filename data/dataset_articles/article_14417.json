  "text": "The number of new study permits approved in 2025 is expected to drop by 50 per cent from last year as a growing number of the permits are going to international students changing schools or programs, or extending their studies in Canada, according to new projections.\nFewer new international students — the result of a decline in new study permit applications and approval rates — could spell trouble for the postsecondary education sector, which will continue to see enrolment drop for at least the next three years, warns an analysis by ApplyBoard based on the latest government data.\n“Onshore students and students extending their studies may help Canada reach its cap targets in 2025, but this trend is unlikely to hold in future years,” said the forecast released Wednesday.\n“Search engine data has shown that interest in studying in Canada has fallen at a greater rate than for Australia, the U.K. or the U.S. And with issued study permit extensions now outpacing new study permits, the flow of new international students toward Canadian institutions is weakening.”\nCanada should be alarmed by the low new student count, said Meti Basiri, CEO and co-founder of the online marketplace for learning institutions and international students.\n“We have effectively closed the tap,” he told the Star. “When your graduation exceeds significantly your entry into the process ... two years from now you will have no students because you graduated everyone.”\nLast year,\nOttawa capped the number of new study permits issued in order to reduce international student admission by 35 per cent, as Canada’s temporary resident population was soaring. The cap did not apply to students for master’s and doctoral programs or in elementary and secondary schools.\nThis year,\nthe study permit caps were reduced by another 10 per cent and include those pursuing post-graduate studies in the country.\nLeveraging early 2025 study permit data, ApplyBoard projects the total number of study permits issued may reach 420,000, just short of the overall cap (437,000). However, Basiri said that’s deceiving because only 163,000 of these permits are going to new international students, half of the volume admitted in 2024 and nearly 70 per cent fewer than 2023.\n“The total number of students still seems high, but give it 18 months or 24 months from now, you all of a sudden have a significant shortage of the students,” he said. “Why? Because the top of the funnel wasn’t filling up.”\nLisa Brunner, a research fellow at the UBC Centre for Migration Studies, believes the softened demand has to do more with the\npost-graduation work permit changes than the cap. Many international students study abroad to ultimately obtain permanent residence but the changing policies have made it difficult to plan toward that goal.\nOn Wednesday, the Immigration Department added 119 and removed 178 fields of study in key sectors from\nthe work permit eligibility list for international graduates.\n“Many international students in Canada today feel betrayed by the lack of permanent residency options that were promised to them,” said Brunner, who studies migration and education.\n“If Canada does not make viable, predictable permanent residency pathways clear for international students, a portion of new students will turn to other so-called competitor countries.”\nApplyBoard’s projection takes into account two significant shifts that have occurred in the past 18 months: falling study permit approval rates and a significant increase in study permit extensions.\nStudy permit extensions will account for over 60 per cent or 260,000 of the 420,000 total study permits issued in 2025, it noted, up from 44 per cent in 2024 and 29 per cent in 2023.\nBetween January and April of this year, there was a 30 per cent drop in new study permit applications compared to the same months in 2024 and 70 per cent compared to 2023. The new study permit approval rates also declined to 33 per cent over the first four months of 2025, resulting in less than 31,000 new approvals.\nBasiri said Ottawa’s study permit caps were established in part on the 60 per cent approval rate in 2023, almost double the current rate. It means a bigger pool of applicants is required to meet the targets.\nWhile colleges faced the most direct impacts of the caps in 2024 and continue to experience substantially lower demand in 2025, universities are now seeing a broader weakening of student demand, said ApplyBoard.\nAccording to the 2025 data, it said study permit applications for university bachelor programs dropped 39 per cent year-over-year, with applications for university graduate programs declining by 32 per cent.\nMany educational institutions have already laid of staff and cancelled programs.\n“Fewer study permit applications are not necessarily bad,” said Brunner. “The question is how institutions, provinces and the federal government manage the economic consequences rippling across the higher education sector.”",
