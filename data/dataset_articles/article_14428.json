  "text": "News / National\nGossip over sex sounds led cook to bash student\n1 hr ago | Views\nA shocking case of violence has emerged at Ruya Adventist School, where the head cook, Lesly Bizwell, allegedly assaulted a student on industrial attachment, leaving her with a broken arm after accusing her of gossiping about her private life.\nThe victim, Meloshance Kashingaidza, a student from Chamtec Vocational Training Centre in Mt Darwin, is said to have been locked in a toilet and viciously beaten by Bizwell using a safety shoe and a thick stick.\nThe assault reportedly stemmed from claims that Kashingaidza had been spreading gossip around the school, alleging that Bizwell made disturbing noises during intimate moments with her partner — noises that allegedly annoyed fellow residents.\nBizwell, who was Kashingaidza's supervisor at the school, appeared in court this week facing assault charges and pleaded not guilty.\nAccording to court documents, the incident occurred on June 7 around 5pm. The State alleges that Bizwell lured Kashingaidza into a toilet under the pretense of cleaning duties, before locking the door and launching a violent attack.\n\"Hanzi ndichakurova kusvikira wanyarara upfidze kuita makuhwa,\" Kashingaidza told H-Metro, recounting the words Bizwell allegedly used, which translate to: \"I will beat you until you stop gossiping and repent.\"\nShe said the assault continued until her arm fractured. \"She used a safety shoe, dry hands and thick sticks. I cried for help and begged her to stop, but she only let me go after my hand was broken,\" she said.\nAttempts were reportedly made to suppress the incident, but the truth emerged when Kashingaidza was taken to Mt Darwin Hospital. Medical staff refused to treat her injuries without a police report, forcing the school to report the matter to authorities.\nThe school's deputy head, Mrs. Zingoni, eventually escorted the injured student to the hospital. Bizwell was arrested three days later.\nSources at the school allege that efforts were made to keep the matter out of the public eye, but pressure from hospital staff and the severity of the injuries brought the case into the open.\nThe matter has raised concerns about student safety during attachments and the abuse of power by supervisors. The case is ongoing, and Kashingaidza is continuing to receive treatment for her injuries.\nThe victim, Meloshance Kashingaidza, a student from Chamtec Vocational Training Centre in Mt Darwin, is said to have been locked in a toilet and viciously beaten by Bizwell using a safety shoe and a thick stick.\nThe assault reportedly stemmed from claims that Kashingaidza had been spreading gossip around the school, alleging that Bizwell made disturbing noises during intimate moments with her partner — noises that allegedly annoyed fellow residents.\nBizwell, who was Kashingaidza's supervisor at the school, appeared in court this week facing assault charges and pleaded not guilty.\nAccording to court documents, the incident occurred on June 7 around 5pm.
