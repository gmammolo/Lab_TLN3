  "text": "Over the last several weeks, lots of big numbers have been tossed around to describe the depth of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools’ financial crisis.\nThe numbers seem to change almost weekly, jumping by the millions, to the point that keeping track of them can be head-spinning.\nAt Tuesday’s school board meeting, the impact of the district’s financial mismanagement was told not by numbers but through the stories of media coordinators — most of us would call them librarians — who told the school board that their work is critical to the success of a school.\nGrace Campbell-Sheran told the story of a girl who saw the library in her school as a way to get out of class.\nThrough Campbell-Sheran’s gentle mentoring, the girl fell in love with “Dork Diaries,” a series of books aimed at young readers. She became an avid reader.\n“Her grades went up. Her grades improved because she came into a space thinking she could get away, but we captured her. She mattered, and I cried when she graduated,” she said.\nCampbell-Sheran changed many lives. She was good at her job. In 2023, the school district named her its Instructional Support Person of the Year.\nA few days ago, she learned she was losing her job as media coordinator at Konnoak Middle School.\n“You talk about expenses. You don’t take just us out of the position; you take a lifeline,” Campbell-Sheran said.\nWith $44 million in cuts to make from its 2025-26 budget, the cost-saving measures are now hitting the employees who make the school district run. Salaries and benefits make up about 85% of the school district’s budget, leaving the district with few places to turn outside of eliminating positions to better align with what the state allots.\nThe local district has exceeded the number of positions that the state will pay for.\nAs principals make decisions on where to save money in their schools, some are choosing to eliminate certified media coordinators, a move that many educators say will be detrimental.\nMany of them made the case for keeping them, describing the work of media coordinators as more than putting books on shelves.\n“These folks, media coordinators, exude love and joy,” said Marty Creech, the magnet school coordinator at Konnoak Middle School.\nThey manage hundreds of school-issued Chromebooks, keep up with changes in technology, including artificial intelligence, write grants and help teachers align their curriculum with relevant materials.\nFor all their duties in keeping a school humming, the most compelling stories the media coordinators shared were of introducing individual students to the wonder and joy of books, a powerful tool in a school district where more than half of third-graders do not read at grade level.\nCaitlyn Berry, a media coordinator at Rural Hall Elementary School, told a story about a young girl wearing a hijab who felt sad as her classmates looked at books in the library about Christmas. Berry said she quickly found some books about Ramadan.\n“Her whole demeanor changes as she looks at the books I have chosen,” Berry told the school board.\nNot long after, the girls who celebrated Christmas and the girl in the hijab were exchanging stories about their respective holidays.\nBerry called it her favorite story of “library joy.”\n“Curious learners, even the youngest, can use libraries as a place of deeper learning,” she said.\nThose who spoke at the meeting said they wanted the school board to ensure that school libraries will be staffed with certified librarians. The school board took no action on that request.\nAmerika Somers, the media coordinator at Paisley Middle School and Lowrance Middle School, said she found out Monday that her position was being reduced by 50%.\n“Librarians are the heart of our school communities,” she said.\nShe asked school board members to recall their memories of school libraries, the excitement of book fairs and the feeling of being in a safe place. Today’s children deserve the same memories, she said.\n“The consequences (of financial mismanagement) are felt most deeply by our students, especially those who rely on these libraries as a lifeline,” Somers said.\n“Re-investing in our position is more than putting books on shelves. It means safeguarding the future of our children, honoring their right to a comprehensive and enriching education and preserving the legacy of safe, nurturing spaces that served you and hopefully will serve future generations as well,” Somers said, her voice shaking with emotion.",
