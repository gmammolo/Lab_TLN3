  "text": "The Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) has flagged as fake a notice claiming to offer 16 additional courses for applicants to the institution.\nOn June 26, KMTC flagged a Facebook Group post that reported the fake courses, warning, \"Beware of conmen!\".\nThe post, in a group purporting to provide insights on the 2025 and 2026 KMTC intakes, advised students with Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) grades ranging from C (plain) to D- (minus) to take advantage of the opportunity.\nIt also claimed that the slots were available for March, May and September intakes.\n\"Are you among those who scored a mean grade of C, C-, D+, D- in your KCSE exams, and your dream is to study a medical course? The mighty Kenya Medical Training College has the solution for you,\" the fake notice read.\nWith over 36,000 members in the group, the fraudulent advertisement exposed many KMTC hopefuls to the risk of being scammed, as it directed prospective applicants to join a separate WhatsApp group.\n\"Announcement! The KUCCPS online system is open for the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) September 2025 intake application,\" KUCCPS announced on June 23.",
