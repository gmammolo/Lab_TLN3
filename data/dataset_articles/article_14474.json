  "text": "Dear Editor,\nAs a physician, a parent, and a member of this community, I’m writing to express deep concern over the way the Bandon School District is treating its teachers—and by extension, our children.\nDear Editor,\nAs a physician, a parent, and a member of this community, I’m writing to express deep concern over the way the Bandon School District is treating its teachers—and by extension, our children.\nOur teachers are the lowest paid in the region, and rather than addressing this long-standing inequity with serious solutions, the current leadership offers only minimal cost-of-living increases. These are not meaningful raises—they are crumbs. At the same time, reports of retaliation against union leaders, including forced transfers and reassignments, are deeply troubling and, if accurate, illegal.\nBeyond the legal implications, this approach is a moral failure. Morale among teachers is at an all-time low. Many no longer feel respected, supported, or safe in their positions. We cannot expect excellence in education when the people we entrust to shape our children’s minds are treated as expendable.\nLeadership is not about control or compliance—it’s about service. True leaders, especially in education, act as servant leaders. They lift their people up. They invest in them. They listen, collaborate, and do what’s right—not what’s easy or politically convenient. Our school staff are the school system. Without them, there is no mission, no learning, no future.\nOur teachers deserve better. Our children deserve better. And our community must do better. I stand with the educators of our district and call on the superintendent and school board to restore integrity, fairness, and servant leadership to our schools.\nSincerely,\nAnn Kellogg\nBandon, Parent and Community Physician\nView our 6-24-25 E-edition right here!\nSuccess!
