  "text": "NEET-UG 2025: Supreme Court Refuses To Transfer Plea From Delhi High Court Over Exam Conduct\nAnmol Kaur Bawa\n26 Jun 2025 3:07 PM IST\nThe Supreme Court today (June 26) refused to transfer to itself a writ petition filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the conduct of the NEET-UG 2025 exam. The Court observed that since the challenge was based on individual facts applicable to the petitioner himself, and not on any ground applicable generally across the board, the High Court was the appropriate forum to decide.\nAdvocate Subhash Jha, for the petitioner, submitted that the signal, which was required to be given to the candidates, was not given.\nThe bench of Justice KV Viswanathan and Justice NK Singh noted that the present petition is fact-based and doesn't challenge the validity of any law; thus, the case wouldn't merit transfer to the Supreme Court. The bench also noted that the High Court has listed the matter on July 31.\nThe counsel requested the bench to consider the transfer to avoid conflicting decisions by different High Courts. However, the bench pointed out that the petition was a fact-based grievance specific to the petitioner.\n\"Your case depends on individual facts. We can transfer only if there are similar questions of law in petitions pending in different High Courts,\" Justice Viswanathan observed.\nHowever, considering the concern raised by the petitioner that the seats would be filled up by the middle of July, the bench allowed him to seek advancement of the hearing.\nConsidering the urgency of the matter, the bench allowed the petitioner to mention it before the Delhi High Court Chief Justice for a possible early hearing.\nThe Madhya Pradesh High Court is also considering a petition filed by candidates who contend that their performance was affected by a power outage at the examination centres in Indore.\nCase Details : ASSAD KHATRI Versus UNION OF INDIA AND ORS.|T.P.(C) No. 1746/2025",
