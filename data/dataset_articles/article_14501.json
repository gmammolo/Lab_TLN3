  "text": "Whether in politics, activism, major media, or academia, the discourse surrounding racial achievement gaps in K-12 education has been going strong for several generations. Grants, studies, educational initiatives, theories, laws, major newspaper and magazine features – these would all have one believe that the people who posture themselves as being committed to solving the problem would do whatever it takes to do so.\nBut there’s one thing many of them apparently will not do.\nAs a June 20 Hearst Connecticut Media report shows, many affluent Connecticut suburbs just cannot figure out how to comply with a state law requiring racial integration in public schools. The law, which requires the racial makeup of each school to approximate the racial makeup of its town, is being flouted by schools in Greenwich, Fairfield, and West Hartford. The state has identified several schools that are on track to be out of compliance because of an “impending imbalance,” including two more in Greenwich and another two in West Hartford; Norwalk appeared the most on that list, with four schools.\nNoteworthy: Fairfield, West Hartford, and Norwalk are Democratic strongholds, as their voting patterns in local, statewide, and federal elections have shown for many years. On the presidential level, voters in all three towns have supported Democrats since the 1990s. Greenwich, the only partial exception, has supported Democratic presidential nominees the past three cycles.\nThe purpose of pointing this out is not to score some cheap “gotcha” on voters in those towns, but rather to understand one of the defining characteristics of modern progressive governance: the wide gulf between stated preferences and revealed preferences. This discrepancy is perhaps most pronounced on issues of race and integration – and it shatters lazy political stereotypes.\nAfter the most recent U.S. Census data (2020) was released, some news outlets picked up on how this plays out regionally. As The Wall Street Journal noted , the North “lags behind the South and Midwest in racial integration.” Forbes was even more direct, pointing out that the Northeast is the American region with the “highest Black-white neighborhood segregation.”\nThis phenomenon is predictably reflected in educational statistics. Citing a 2022 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, NPR noted , “Segregation has historically been associated with the Jim Crow laws of the South. But the report finds that, in the 2020-21 school year, the highest percentage of schools serving a predominantly single-race/ethnicity student population – whether mostly white, mostly Hispanic or mostly Black etc. – were in the Northeast and the Midwest.”\nAnd in 2021, the University of California, Los Angeles’ Civil Rights Project found that “New York retains its place as the most segregated state for black students, and second most segregated for Latino students, trailing only California.”\nThere are competing theories on the political left and right regarding how to address gaps in academic performance. The traditionally conservative view is that school choice – through charter schools, magnet schools, and private-school vouchers – offers the greatest measurable benefits. On the left, the answer is often providing access to high-performing public schools in wealthier neighborhoods – in other words, following through on the logic put forth in the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bown v. Board of Education.\nThe point here is not to relitigate that issue, but, again, to underscore the fact that the stated preferences of Democrats – especially affluent Democrats, who tend to skew more left-wing – do not align with their revealed preferences. When some of the bluest and best-resourced districts in liberal Connecticut somehow can’t figure out how to comply with anti-segregation law, maybe residents and their elected leaders should consider getting their own houses in order before protesting the current White House.
