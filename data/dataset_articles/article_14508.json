  "text": "Contracts for about 200 school bus drivers across the Bloomfield , Cromwell, East Hartford and Middletown districts are set to expire on July 1, but their union said it is working to secure new agreements. The contract talks involve the school bus drivers' union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and their employer, New Britain -headquartered Dattco. Among Dattco's drivers, the Teamsters represent about 70 in East Hartford, around 45 in Bloomfield, and a total of approximately 80 in Cromwell and Middletown, which have the same bus yard. Factoring in other employers, the Teamsters represent about 1,600 school bus workers across Connecticut. “We plan on meeting biweekly with the company and have scheduled at least one bargaining session for the month of July,” Bryan Chong, a spokesperson for Teamsters Local 671, the Teamsters' Connecticut local, told CT Insider on Wednesday. “There will not be an automatic strike upon the expiration of the contract on July 1. There will only be a strike if Local 671 Teamsters vote to authorize one. Local 671 Teamsters may work under an expired contract for some time.” No strike-authorization votes have been taken or scheduled yet, Chong added. The bus drivers have sought to raise awareness of their push for new contracts by holding several “practice pickets” in the past few weeks. In a news release for a practice picket on June 13 in East Hartford, Teamsters officials called on Dattco representatives to “come to the bargaining table with good-faith, reasonable proposals that reflect the essential services Teamsters provide to get students to and from school safely every day.” Messages left this week for Dattco were not returned. In East Hartford, school district officials said that they were monitoring the situation. “East Hartford Public Schools has contracted with Dattco for many years to provide student transportation, including services for some summer programs,” district officials said in a written statement Wednesday. “Although the district does not participate in negotiations between the company and its drivers, we respect both parties and are optimistic they will work in the best interest of their priorities and the students in East Hartford Public Schools. We look forward to a positive resolution and have plans to ensure there will be no impact to transportation services this summer.” A spokesperson for East Hartford Public Schools did not respond to a follow-up message inquiring whether the district’s contingency plans included possibly contracting with another transportation provider if the Teamsters-represented drivers went on strike. Messages left this week for the superintendents of Bloomfield, Cromwell and Middletown school districts were not returned. There has been significant labor unrest at several other Connecticut companies recently. About 3,100 machinists at jet-engine maker Pratt & Whitney went on strike for three weeks last month, before approving a new four-year contract . At submarine manufacturer General Dynamics Electric Boat, about 2,500 marine drafters nearly went on strike before voting for a new five-year contract on May 27. Also last month, about 8,000 workers at nursing homes and group homes across Connecticut came close to going on strike , before they secured wage increases. The strike at Pratt & Whitney and narrowly averted strikes at Electric Boat and the nursing and group homes raised awareness of a bill passed last month by the state legislature that would have provided unemployment benefits to striking workers . Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed the bill this week, saying he supports workers’ rights to organize and strike, but was concerned that signing the bill would send a negative message to businesses.
