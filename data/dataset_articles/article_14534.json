  "text": "CUMBERLAND – Ten years ago this week, a pair of teachers leading a group of Cumberland High School students on a trip to Ecuador provided those students with alcohol, an action that helped lead to their resignation.\nParents at the time said they wanted to make sure nothing similar to this ever happened again, saying their children were also left alone in a city for long periods of time, and that they were told not to talk to their parents after they got home about what had transpired.\nMemories of that trip were front of mind last week after Michael Feroce, the Cumberland High School band director credited with bringing back the program after a long hiatus, resigned following an inappropriate incident on a field trip.\nFeroce, according to school officials, was found to have been inside the hotel room of female high school students for an extended period of time during an overnight field trip.\nThe departed teacher has not responded to requests for comment.\nThere was no evidence that inappropriate contact was involved, according to school officials, but Feroce was in the room late in the evening during a trip to New York City over Memorial Day weekend.\n“Although Mr. Feroce’s presence in the room appeared consensual and there was no evidence uncovered of improper physical contact on this trip, Mr. Feroce’s decision to go into the hotel room of female students late in the evening reflected conduct that the superintendent found unacceptable,” School Committee Chairperson Amy Vogel said in a statement at a meeting to discuss the matter on Wednesday evening, June 18.\nAdded Vogel, “the superintendent believed that Mr. Feroce’s conduct was unbecoming of a Cumberland School Department teacher and irreconcilable with further employment,” Vogel added.\nStudents were interviewed as part of the investigation, according to school officials. Vogel said those conversations revealed that Feroce had students help him with household tasks at his home, “which in of itself reflects a boundary violation.”\nFeroce has been known for his energetic advocacy for the band, bringing it from a struggling program to one of the top ones in the area, routinely performing well at competitions.\nParents have been critical of school officials for not communicating openly about what was transpiring, and that they had to rely on rumors told to them by their children.\nAsked this week whether the overnight field trip policies need to change in response to this latest incident, Supt. Phil Thornton said the policy is pretty comprehensive, and no policy could have prevented what happened. That said, after any incident, it’s prudent to “review everything we do based on current events,” he said.\nCHS Principal Adolfo Costa agreed on the idea that these trips still have value.\n“I believe overnight field trips can be incredibly rewarding and enriching opportunities for students,” he said. “It’s important not to lose sight of the educational and social growth these experiences can provide.”\nFeroce began teaching at CHS during the 2013-2014 school year following the departure of longtime band director Lisa Koziol-Kenyon. He graduated with a degree in music education from the University of Rhode Island in 2012. At the time, there were only about 40 students participating in band, and Feroce and students began selling Clipper Coffee that year as a start to bringing back the marching band and color guard after a decade without one.\n“It’s really endless what you can do with a marching band,” Feroce said at the time, adding that the band can attend all sporting events. “It would bring a lot of attention to Cumberland for sure.”\nThe band grew into an award-winning program under Feroce’s leadership, as he repeatedly lobbied for resources, including new uniforms. He also helped bring back the program after it was halted during the pandemic, and also grew music classes during his tenure.\n“Pre-pandemic, we were setting enrollment records, scoring top-level superior performances at band and choral festivals, and performing dozens of gigs a year,” he said in 2022.\nHe said then that he was happy to see Cumberland’s Clipper Band and Chorus returning to their pre-pandemic selves, with Director Amanda Santo running the chorus and Clef Singers as part of a vibrant music department.",
