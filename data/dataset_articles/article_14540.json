  "text": "Michigan education bills disregard students' needs, says policy group\n Chrystal Blair, Producer\nThursday, June 26, 2025\nThe Michigan League for Public Policy is warning recently passed education budget bills may appear to boost funding but ultimately fall short.\nThe League argued the legislation cuts essential K-12 services such as school meals, health centers and transportation, while also threatening higher education by reducing support for colleges and limiting access for low-income students. They contended the plan moves Michigan backward by abandoning a fair funding formula.\nAlexandra Stamm, education policy analyst for the league, said the funding shift will harm many groups of students and schools.\n\"Instead of keeping those buckets of money for rural students, transportation, English-language learners, etc., this budget really just wipes all of those categoricals and then evenly distributes it across the state,\" Stamm explained.\nThe House bills have made it through both the Appropriations Committee and the full House, and are now in the hands of the Senate Appropriations Committee for review.\nWith the federal Department of Education facing $12 billion in budget cuts, Stamm stressed the uncertainty at the national level is trickling down to the states, so local education leaders need to work hard to keep classrooms steady despite the changing tides.\n\"It is really important that we continue to invest in schools here in Michigan with an eye towards equity,\" Stamm urged. \"So that our schools can feel as though they are kind of safe and grounded from some of the uncertainty at the federal level.\"\nNationwide, 80% of schools have reduced academic programs, including art, music and physical education, due to budget constraints.\nclick here.\nget more stories like this via email\nSocial Issues\nNelsonville residents have another chance to shape their city's political map.
