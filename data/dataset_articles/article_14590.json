  "text": "The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) has dismissed four leaders of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) for their role in leading a lecturers’ strike that has now lasted more than 70 days.\nThe striking lecturers are demanding a salary increase from the current US$230 to US$2,250 per month.\nThose dismissed include AUT President Munyaradzi Chamburuka, Secretary-General Bornface Mwakorera, Organising Secretary Justin Tandire, and Spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi.\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on Wednesday, 25 June, Vengeyi said the university claimed the dismissals were due to the union’s use of the Great Hall without official approval.\nHowever, he argued that university authorities had facilitated the event by opening the hall and providing both a legal officer and security personnel at the time. Said Vengeyi:\nThe four were suspended last month and later underwent disciplinary hearings.\nWe have received dismissal letters from the university following the disciplinary proceedings. We were suspended on the 6th of May, and the letters stated that the dismissal is effective from the date of our suspension.\nWe wrote to the registrar that we wished to use the great hall for the purposes of balloting on the 28th of March and the balloting was meant for the 2nd of April, but the registrar did not respond to our letter of request.\nThen came the second of April, the university opened the hall and also brought in a legal officer of the University of Zimbabwe to be part of the proceedings.\nThe university also supplied security guards to oversee the process until the end and then two days later, that is when they said we used the hall without authorisation.\nVengeyi said that despite being dismissed, the union leaders and their members would continue picketing at the university.\nHe added that the AUT plans to take legal action, arguing that the dismissals were unlawful and meant to intimidate lecturers into ending their strike.\nWe are still AUT members, and we will continue with our strike and our picketing. We will also seek legal remedy, which we will discuss later with our legal advisor.\nWe are not disturbed at all, not worried. We knew they would reach this decision because, even during the disciplinary hearings, they classified the offence under Schedule D, which allows dismissal on the first offence and we knew this was their intention, to fire us in the hope that it would stop the strike.\nMore: NewZimbabwe.com",
