  "text": "Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray has strongly opposed the Maharashtra government's decision to introduce Hindi as a third language in state-run schools. Addressing a press conference, Thackeray announced a series of protests, including the symbolic burning of the government resolution on June 29 (Sunday) and a public demonstration on July 7 (Monday).\n'This is about imposing a language, not inclusion'\nThackeray began his press conference by highlighting what he called the imposition of Hindi over Marathi. “Today, those who love Marathi have come together in protest. It’s now clear why the BJP wanted to destroy the original Shiv Sena,” he said.\nHe emphasised that neither he nor his party is against any language. “We are not against Hindi. The Hindi film industry was born in Maharashtra. But forcing a language is unacceptable,” he said.\nCalls for CM to roll back the policy\nHe said the controversy could be resolved in two minutes if the Chief Minister withdrew the decision to make Hindi the third language. “We plan to take this issue to the streets. This is a protest for Marathi pride, not against any other language,” Thackeray added.\n'One language, one party agenda'\nThackeray accused the BJP of attempting to impose a “one language, one party” ideology, referencing BJP President JP Nadda's earlier statements. “This is a linguistic emergency. Traitors who once called themselves Shiv Sainiks are now part of this government,” he said.\nHe added that India’s federal structure is built around linguistic states and accused the government of not implementing policies that promote Marathi despite numerous previous efforts.\nAppeal for broader support\nCalling the move part of the BJP’s “hidden agenda,” Thackeray urged political parties, the film industry, legal professionals, and genuine Marathi-speaking BJP workers to join the protest. “It’s becoming difficult to find true BJP workers these days,” he quipped.\nCriticism of Deputy CM Shinde and Raj Thackeray\nHe questioned the rationale behind the three-language formula, arguing that India is a multilingual nation and no single language should be prioritised in this way. Taking a jibe at Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, he said, “He is supporting the policy only because he is helpless.”\nWhen asked about MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s stance on implementing Hindi in schools, Uddhav Thackeray said bluntly, “I don’t look at others’ positions on this issue.”\n'Credit score is useless if jobs are scarce'\nTouching briefly on other governance issues, Thackeray criticised the administration's focus on improving credit scores without addressing unemployment. “What’s the use of a better credit score if our youth don’t get jobs?” he asked.",
