  "text": "University of Missouri Systems FY ’26 budget shows 40 million dollars in cuts\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (KMIZ)\nThe University of Missouri Board of Curators is set to meet Thursday to approve its budget for the 2026 fiscal year.\nThe proposed budget includes $5.3 billion in funding across all four campuses: The University of Missouri Columbia, The University of Missouri Kansas City, Missouri S&T and the University of Missouri Saint Louis. However, university officials are facing $40 million in budget cuts and reallocations.\nThe UM Board of Curators listed funding challenges such as limited growth in state support past the 2026 fiscal year and navigating the federal funding landscape. However, the board sees the opportunity for strong student retention with first time college student enrollment up 46% for the 2025 school year.\nOfficials are also looking into performance-based salary increases.\nThursday's meeting will begin at 11:15 in Saint Joseph, Missouri.",
