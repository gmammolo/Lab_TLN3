  "text": "SARATOGA SPRINGS — As a child, Laura Chodos followed her parents to settlement houses in Roxbury, Mass., where they taught English to immigrants.\nAnd throughout her life, Chodos, who died on June 14 at 98 years old, never faltered to model her parents’ example, uplifting others through education, inclusion and human connection.\n“I was brought up on a philosophy of service,” she told the Times Union in 2001. “The issue of values are caught, not taught.”\nShe lived by that motto, serving 17 years on the state Board of Regents and establishing the state Archives Student Research Awards competition that she also bankrolled through her Chodos Family Fund. “She was just amazing,” Janet Braga, director of the state Archives Partnership Trust, said. “When I first met her, she set me straight. She said ‘you are a statewide organization. You have a responsibility … to include all communities.’ She understood education is meant to improve society and this is the program that will help future citizens do that. … She was a rare breed. She was such an inspiration, truly.”\nBut that’s just the half of it. She also served on the board of Two Together, a tutoring program for Griffen Elementary in Albany, served as a chairwoman for a sister city exchange with Saratoga Springs and Chekhov, Russia, and sat on the board of Shelters of Saratoga, sharing her time and treasure to work to build a permanent homeless shelter in the city. She was also a member of the city’s 2017 Charter Review Commission, advocating for a change in the city’s charter. And, like her parents, she taught English to the Saratoga Race Course’s immigrant workforce, telling the Times Union, “I would like to see ways we can be kinder to one another.”\nBob Turner, chair of the city’s Charter Review Commission, said Chodos was full of wisdom.\n“I thought, here’s a woman who is 90,” Turner said. “By our second meeting, I realized she was so wise, so smart. Laura was an invaluable member of the charter review commission with her tremendous wisdom and lived experience. She could always see the best in her fellow humans and had the highest aspirations of what Saratoga Springs could be.”\nAccording to her obituary, Chodos was born on Dec. 22, 1926, and grew up in Boston, a child of parents who immigrated from Canada. She attended the Girls Latin School and went on to attend Tufts University, earning her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics and urban sociology. She was married for 58 years to Dr. Robert Bruno Chodos, professor of nuclear medicine and radiology at Albany Medical College, until his death in 2008. They had four children and when they were in high school, she enrolled in doctoral studies in education at the University at Albany. In an interview with the Times Union in 2010, she called herself a lifelong Democrat and a political activist since age 3. And as such, she supported many Democratic causes and candidates, including the city’s Commissioner of Finance Minita Sanghvi, who said Chodos was not only supportive politically, but encouraged her to fulfill her dreams. That included bringing Sanghvi to her first Broadway show and gathering friends at her home for a salon to read Sanghvi’s romance novel. “Laura was always such an inspiration,” Sanghvi posted on Facebook. “She was interested in local politics, in people, in students at Skidmore (College), in learning and teaching and everything on this planet. I would often call her our Queen Bee because she truly was a Queen,” adding “she was kind, curious and encouraging.” Chodos was first appointed by the state Legislature to represent the 4th Judicial District of the state Board of Regents in 1976, where she sat through 1992. Board of Regents Chancellor Lester Young, Jr. released a statement on Chodos. “It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of Laura Chodos,” the Tuesday statement read. “Throughout her 17 years of service to the Board, former Regent Chodos was a champion for New York State’s libraries, archives, and museums. She twice represented the state at White House Conferences on Libraries and Technology, and her work ultimately earned her a Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York State Archives Partnership Trust in 2018. Her enduring legacy is one of leadership, advocacy, and diplomacy. On behalf of the Board of Regents and the New York State Education Department, we extend our heartfelt sympathies to her family, loved ones, and all who knew her.” Her work with the state Archives began at the end of her tenure on the Board of Regents, establishing the competition that required students to use primary source material for a research project. The program was meant to promote and recognize excellence in student research and inspire students to explore materials preserved in libraries and archives throughout the state. As part of that, Braga said, Chodos made sure that every county participated in the competition. She also celebrated the students' successes. “She would come every year to the awards program and to be right there standing next to students,” Braga said. “Her level of engagement with the students was inspiring. She got on their level and talked to them, not at them. She just had this way. She drew people in. … Laura has an incredible legacy and it’s an honor to carry it forward.” On the Charter Review Commission, Turner said her perspective helped maintain goodwill when the process got “tough or adversarial.”\n“People would often say things that got to me,” Turner said. “She was always there with a kind note and positive attitude that could pick you up like that.”\nAnd she stayed engaged in trying to make the world better right up until the end, he said.\n“As recently as two months ago, she offered to get together a panel of speakers to discuss resolving the conflict in Israel,” Turner said. “That was Laura Chodos, caring about fellow mankind until the end.”\nPerhaps it is best said by Chodos herself.\n“At the end of the day,” she wrote in a 2007 Letter to the Editor published in the Times Union, “we all wish we could do more because we know how much more is needed.” Sign up for Times Union newsletters here Read the original article on timesunion.com",
