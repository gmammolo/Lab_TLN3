  "text": "Hope Christian Elementary faces questions over reporting of sexual abuse allegation\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nEditorial Standards\nLegal experts question whether the school delayed reporting to police, potentially violating state law.\nEditorial Standards\nAn Albuquerque teacher is facing formal charges of sexually abusing an 11-year-old girl at Hope Christian Elementary School — and now questions are emerging about whether school officials followed state law when the allegations first came to light.\nKelly McEachren, a fifth-grade teacher, has been charged with criminal sexual penetration and contact of a minor. According to court records, the abuse allegedly occurred during the 2024–25 school year, while the child was in his class.\nTimeline raises legal concerns\nDocuments show the allegations were first reported to school staff on April 6. The next day, April 7, McEachren was placed on administrative leave after school officials confirmed the details with the girl’s parents. That same day, Albuquerque police responded to a child sexual abuse call and interviewed the family.\nIt wasn’t until April 8 that school principal Robyn Taylor spoke with police — raising concerns about whether the school delayed its obligation to report.\nUnder New Mexico’s mandatory reporting law, any person who suspects child abuse is legally required to report it immediately.\n“The statute reads that the report shall be made immediately,” said KOAT legal analyst John Day. “If the school waited or conducted its own internal investigation first, it may have been in violation.”\nDay said the law’s use of the word “immediately” can be subject to interpretation.\n“Does it mean the minute a student reports it to a teacher? Should they call 911 right away? Or can they wait and consult lawyers or verify details?” Day said. “That part of the law is not clearly defined.”\nSchool says it cooperated with authorities\nIn an email sent to Hope Christian families, the school acknowledged being aware of the allegations since they were initially made. It also stated that the school had “been actively working with and cooperating with all authorities and parties involved.”\nHowever, KOAT reached out to Principal Taylor for clarification about exactly when the school notified police. She did not return calls or emails.\nAs of publication, the Albuquerque Police Department has also not responded to inquiries about the timeline of the school’s involvement in the case.\nTeacher denies allegations\nMcEachren has denied all allegations through his attorney. A judge denied a motion to cancel his arrest warrant on Monday.\nThis case is still under investigation, and more information is expected as legal proceedings move forward.",
