Theoretically, the research brought together an interdisciplinary framework for educational inclusion and the trans inclusion staged model to pursue conceptualisations and expressions of inclusion that disrupt cisnormative policies and structures. A survey of 14 co-educational secondary schools generated data from 36 students who identified as trans (n = 18) or non-binary (n = 18). The findings revealed that most trans (n = 16) and all non-binary students expressed preferences for mixed-sex grouping in PE. They also underscore the many challenges and contradictions faced by trans and non-binary students in PE, including being stigmatised by peers for not conforming to cisnormative gender expectations and/or being forced to accept disaffirmation of their gender identity in order to participate in PE and ‘fit in’.\nDOI\n10.1080/14681366.2025.2509269\nCreative Commons License\nThis work is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.",
