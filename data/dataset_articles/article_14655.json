  "text": "Waco Independent School District trustees have approved a state-required turnaround plan for South Waco Elementary School, hoping to improve low student performance and avoid state intervention.\nThe action was triggered by South Waco Elementary receiving an F in the 2023 accountability ratings released earlier this year. The school received an F in 2019 and, with accountability ratings waived for 2020 through 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its recovery, that proved to be a second consecutive year with a failing score, requiring the district to submit a turnaround plan.\nThe plan will include implementation of a new state-produced math curriculum, more frequent monitoring of student instruction and testing results, increased supervision by administrators, and details of how students’ progress will be measured.\nAt a called meeting Tuesday, trustees unanimously approved the proposed plan presented by Karmen Logan, WISD’s executive director of elementary education. The deadline for its submission to the Texas Education Agency is Monday.\nState requirements for failing schools call for use of state-approved “high quality instructional materials” in curriculum. A third-party evaluation in the fall under the state’s Effective Schools Framework found that while 63% of reading and language arts assignments in Waco ISD met the threshold for high quality assignments, only 20% of math ones did.\nTrustees at their June 18 meeting reversed a previous decision and approved the Bluebonnet Learning math curriculum, which would meet state requirements for the school turnaround.\nA school’s fifth straight year with a failing accountability grade could lead to state intervention at the school or even the district level. Superintendent Tiffany Spicer said after the presentation that it’s unclear which year’s scores the TEA would use in determining South Waco’s fate. The 2024 accountability scores are currently withheld due to ongoing legal action, and the 2025 scores are set for release in August.\nThe South Waco Elementary principal, assistant principal and district administrators will be performing the instructional walkthroughs, teacher and leadership training, Spicer said.\nThe turnaround plan for South Waco comes as the school transitions into an expanded, renovated facility, the last phase of the Waco ISD’s $355 million bond issue that saw four new schools constructed. Spicer said while the move into new classrooms and other spaces might be an initial distraction for students, staff and faculty would work to keep them focused on academics.\nFour other Waco schools received F grades in the 2023 accountability ratings — Dean Highland, Kendrick and Brook Avenue elementary schools, and G.W. Carver Middle School — and could see mandated turnaround plans with a second year of a failing grade.\nWaco ISD isn’t the only local district filing school turnaround plans with the TEA this month. Connally ISD is submitting turnaround plans for its elementary school and junior high school as well, said district spokesperson Michael Donaldson.",
