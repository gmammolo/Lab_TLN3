  "text": "Key Takeaways Childhood trauma can cost kids education\nExposure to a traumatic event more than doubles a kid’s risk of chronic absenteeism\nExposure to more events further increases the odds a child will miss more school\nTHURSDAY, June 26, 2025 (HealthDay News) — Violence, addiction and abuse can keep children a step behind other kids when it comes to their education, a new study says.\nChildren who’ve experienced only a single traumatic event are more than twice as likely to be chronically absent from school due to health problems, researchers reported in the journal Academic Pediatrics .\nAnd the more adverse events a child endures, the higher the odds they’ll miss more school, researchers add.\n“This study reinforces what pediatricians have long known: that kids exposed to adversity often show up in the clinic and the classroom with complex challenges,” lead researcher Dr. Rebecca Tsevat , a pediatrician and general internist at UCLA Health, said in a news release.\nAdverse childhood experiences already have been associated with lifetime health problems like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, sexually transmitted infections and suicide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe toxic stress caused by these experiences can affect a child’s brain development and immune response, making them vulnerable to a host of physical and mental health problems, the CDC says.\nFor this new study, researchers analyzed data from parents of more than 10,000 children 6 to 17 collected by the 2021-2022 National Health Interview Survey, a regular poll conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.\nAbout 1 in 4 (24%) of these children had been exposed at least one adverse childhood event, including:\nViolence\nAn incarcerated parent\nA mentally ill, drug addicted or alcoholic member of their household\nVerbal or emotional abuse\nA lack of basic needs like food or housing\nDiscrimination based on their race or ethnicity\nMore from this section Updated COVID Vaccines Effective Against New Strains",
