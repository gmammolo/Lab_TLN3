  "text": "Rising health insurance premiums for employees are a key reason a majority of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities are asking for increases in tuition and mandatory fees for the 2025-26 academic year. Presidents of 15 of those institutions told the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education that insurance costs and other types of “mandatory expenses” — such as higher utility prices — have created budget holes they need to fill. Regents, whose approval is needed for such increases, considered the requests Wednesday, June 25. They are scheduled to vote on whether or not to grant those increases Thursday, June 26. All 15 schools already have had their requests vetted and approved by institutional boards. “If there’s one reason I’m standing before you today, it’s health insurance,” said Rodney Hanley, the president of Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, who asked for a 3% increase. His colleagues, while making their presentations during the June 25 meeting, echoed his reasoning. Thomas Newsom, the outgoing president of Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, said his proposed budget reflected an 11.5% increase in health care costs, which would make premiums rise from $853 to $960 per month per employee. Dennis Casey, the chair of the state regents’ board, called health insurance costs “the biggest problem” facing Oklahoma institutions. More: University of Oklahoma tuition will likely cost students more this fall It's certainly an issue at the University of Oklahoma, said its president, Joseph Harroz, who said he was told he could expect double-digit-percentage increases in health insurance costs in coming years. He noted OU currently spends about $140 million to cover those costs and wondered how it could absorb 10% annual increases to that number. Leaders of schools that have gone multiple years without requesting an increase — including Oklahoma City Community College, Northwestern Oklahoma State University in Alva and Rose State College in Midwest City — also cited inflationary costs in health insurance as a primary reason for asking to raise rates this year, noting they were limited in ways they could generate sufficient revenue. Some universities, such as those under the Regional University System of Oklahoma umbrella, already work with one another and other schools to try and reduce health care costs. Diana Lovell, the president of Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, told regents they should consider an even larger approach, perhaps including all 25 of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities. “We need to address this as a system so that we can get this under control,” she said. OU has steadily increased its tuition and fee rates under Harroz, who defended that practice, saying regents should expect him to be back asking for higher tuition during at least the next two years. He acknowledged the “visceral reaction” to raising tuition, but added, “if we just stay steady, were going to be caught from behind,” noting efforts by schools in north Texas to try and recruit Oklahoma students. Harroz said while the sticker price for in-state undergraduate students has risen since the 2018-19 school year by 12% to $14,810 annually, OU’s financial aid and scholarship programs have lowered the net cost for those students during that same time frame by 27% to $3,976. “Our goal is that every Oklahoman who has the ability will be able to go to the University of Oklahoma,” Harroz said. Todd Lamb, the president of the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, asked for a 2.6% increase, which would increase the annual cost in tuition and mandatory fees for an in-state student to $9,043.50. He said he would have asked for more, but had been asked by RUSO officials to reduce his requests and that, “I wanted to be a team player.” Lamb said the upcoming fiscal year “promises to be the most positive year financially for UCO in nearly a decade.” He said a three-year plan to reduce an $11 million budget deficit has lowered that number to under $1 million. Regent Jack Sherry asked Lamb how much of an increase in enrollment UCO — the state’s third-largest university — would need to close that gap further. Lamb said that remains to be determined, but added, “That’s the prayer, that’s the goal, that’s the hope, to still be able to do that” this year. OCCC asked for the state’s largest increase in tuition and mandatory fees of 8%, which would increase the annual cost for a student to $4,481.80. President Mautra Staley Jones said it has been seven years since her school had asked for an increase, but it could no longer hold the financial line. “That decision (not to raise tuition) has been intentional and mission-driven and grounded in (providing) access for the students that we serve,” she said. “During the same time, we've done without and we've absorbed rising costs, deferred investments and delayed needed advancements, all while continuing to serve our students with excellence. But today we're at a point where we are really needing to bring the college up to current times.” Ten Oklahoma colleges and universities did not request an increase in tuition and mandatory fees. Those schools were Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Rogers State University in Claremore, Cameron University in Lawton, Oklahoma Panhandle State University in Goodwell, the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma in Chickasha, Carl Albert State College in Poteau, Eastern Oklahoma State College in Wilburton, Northern Oklahoma College in Tonkawa, Redlands Community College in El Reno and Tulsa Community College. After a recent meeting of the OSU/A&M Board of Regents, new Oklahoma State University President James Hess said OSU’s “Number One priority is to try and keep education affordable (and) accessible for students.\" Keeping tuition low, he said, requires the school to \"work on the expense side of the equation.\" \"How do you squeeze out efficiencies in our budget so that we can maintain the lowest possible costs for the students?” he said.
