  "text": "The letter also stated that all teachers have the option to register their complaints online through the e-Shiksha Kosh portalPatna: The education dept has asked teachers not to visit secretariat to lodge their complaints over transfer issues.In a letter issued to the district education officers (DEOs) on Wednesday, additional chief secretary S Siddharth said that issues related to transfers within the district will be considered by the committee formed under the chairmanship of district officer concerned, and appropriate action will be taken.The letter also stated that all teachers have the option to register their complaints online through the e-Shiksha Kosh portal. These complaints are regularly monitored at the state-level by the district-wise nominated nodal officers, he said. All complaints lodged by the teachers and registered are simultaneously visible to the district education officer, director of primary and secondary education, director of mid-day meal scheme, and additional chief secretary of the department, he added. Under the e-Shiksha Kosh system, the DEO has been assigned the responsibility of resolving the complaints and uploading compliance reports on the portal, so that the additional chief secretary's public grievance cell can periodically review them.Only inter-district matters will be considered at the state-level in very special circumstances.The letter stated that teachers trying to contact officials at the secretariat regarding the transfer issues disrupt departmental activities. Visiting the secretariat also causes personal difficulties for the teachers, it added.",
