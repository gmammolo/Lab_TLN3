  "text": "Former govt polytechnic faculty, who joined the engineering colleges through Gujarat Public Service Commission recruitments, face AGP denial due to their previous service being unrecognizedAhmedabad: More than 200 qualified faculty members in the state's govt engineering colleges continue to wait for their academic grade pay (AGP) revision, despite the career advancement scheme (CAS) being in effect for over a year. These educators, who actively support programmes like SSIP, Vibrant Gujarat, Semicon, G20 summits, hackathons and Skill India, say they find the inordinate wait frustrating. Following a govt resolution in March 2024 regarding CAS benefits for appointments made after Jan 1, 2016, the Commissionerate of Technical Education (CTE) sought applications through the Kozent portal in Aug 2024. Although 80% of applications have been reviewed, various administrative and procedural challenges prevent the issuance of AGP orders.Former govt polytechnic faculty, who joined the engineering colleges through Gujarat Public Service Commission recruitments, face AGP denial due to their previous service being unrecognized. Furthermore, faculty members obtaining PhD qualifications after their initial AGP (Rs 6,000-7,000) have not received the one-year relaxation stipulated in AICTE's Jan 2016 guidelines for AGP progression to Rs 8,000.Faculty members who earned additional qualifications after their appointments and filed post-facto NOC applications in Jan 2025 remain in limbo. Additionally, those who have previous adhoc or regular service experience face delays in pay protection, pending verification from the Pay Verification Unit (PVU), Gandhinagar.Teaching staff associations have requested the education department and the CTE to address the pending cases by July 31, indicating possible statewide demonstrations if their concerns remain unaddressed.",
