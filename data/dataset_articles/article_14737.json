  "text": "Kalna: As the bell rings, students milling around in the grounds quickly move to their classrooms. The classes begin, and the lectures of the teachers can be heard standing in the corridors. Everything seems normal in the Kishoriganj Manmohanpur Free Primary School in the Nasratpur area of Kalna sub-division in Purba Bardhaman district of West Bengal until one pips into the kitchen.\nFor the past several years, the midday meal has been cooked in two times in a separate set of utensils. The division gets stark from the gas cylinder itself, with one pipe being divided into two parts for different ovens. The school in Purbasthali I block of the district has 72 students, of whom 43 are Hindus and 29 are Muslims. The school management, those involved in cooking midday meals, as well as the headmaster, say the segregation of utensils and the process of separate cooking have been going on for a long time.\nRanu Bibi has been cooking midday meals in the primary school for many years. \"We have always been cooking in two sets. The children of both religions are also served separately. We know it is a bad practice, but we hardly have a choice other than following the school administration's guidelines,\" she said.\nSonali Majumdar, another cook assigned to prepare food for the other community, said, \"Only the gas connection is from one cylinder; the rest are separate. It is unfortunate, but we just follow what we are told to do.\"\nPrincipal Tapas Ghosh stresses that there is no conflict in the school over religion. \"There is no problem in the school, and no religious conflict has ever arisen over the arrangement. Students attend classes and study together. But the food is cooked separately. I have been seeing this since my first day here. Several attempts to end the practice have proved futile. The expenses are also high due to this practice, and I have informed the school education department as well as the district administration,\" Ghosh said.\nThe district administration has swung into action after the matter went public. \"An enquiry has been ordered and steps will be taken after we get the report,\" Ayesha Rani, district magistrate of Purba Bardhaman, said.\nNasratpur Residents are Still Divided\nResident Amit Hazari said, \"The practice of cooking separately for both faiths has been followed by the primary school for a long time. The decision was taken after receiving consent from both sides.\" Parimal Mandal, whose son studies in the school, also favours the practice.\nHowever, Ganesh Gonsai and Hussein Ali say the practice of cooking and serving midday meals separately should end. \"If they can study and play together, where is the problem in eating together?\" Local Trinamool leader Ahmed Ali Sheikh said, \"Students study together, but the meal is cooked separately. The headmaster has informed us about the situation. This should end, as it is shameful,\" he said.\nPaushali Chakraborty, district project officer and midday meal in charge of Purba Bardhaman, said, \"The committee has been constituted and the matter is being looked into.\" Officials at the school education department have informed that the committee headed by the Joint BDO will be probing the matter and submitting a report soon.\nState Minister and Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim has expressed strong displeasure over the incident. \"Whoever did this did it wrong. This is not the culture of Bengal. We have always seen students of each faith sharing a single tiffin. The education department should take action against those trying to keep the practice alive. This is a shameful incident for me. My close friends in school were of different faiths, and we grew up sharing each other's food. The evil practice of the Bardhaman primary school has to stop,\" he said.",
