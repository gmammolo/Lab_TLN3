  "text": "News / National\nUniversity of Zimbabwe dismisses 4 striking lecturers\n1 hr ago | Views\nThe University of Zimbabwe (UZ) administration has dismissed four prominent leaders of the ongoing lecturers' strike, which has now entered its 71st day. The strike centers on the lecturers' demand for a salary increase from the current US$230 to US$2,250.\nThe dismissed leaders are key officials of the Association of University Teachers (AUT): President Munyaradzi Chamburuka, Secretary-General Bornface Mwakorera, Organising Secretary Justin Tandire, and Spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi.\nAccording to Vengeyi, the dismissals were based on allegations that the leaders used the university's Great Hall without official approval. However, he countered these claims, stating that the university itself had opened the hall for them, provided a legal officer, and supplied security personnel during the event.\n\"We were suspended on May 6 and later faced disciplinary hearings. We have now received our dismissal letters, effective from the date of suspension,\" Vengeyi said.\nHe explained that the AUT had initially requested permission from the university registrar on March 28 to use the Great Hall for balloting scheduled for April 2 but did not receive a response. On the day of the balloting, the university allowed the use of the hall and sent officials to oversee the process.\n\"Despite this, two days later, the university claimed we had used the hall without authorisation,\" Vengeyi added.\nUndeterred by their dismissal, the leaders vowed to continue the strike and picketing, with plans to seek legal recourse.\n\"We remain AUT members and are committed to the strike. We will pursue legal remedies with advice from our lawyers. We anticipated this outcome, as the offence they charged us with falls under Schedule D, which permits dismissal on the first offence,\" Vengeyi said.\nThe University of Zimbabwe's strike has severely impacted academic activities, with no resolution in sight as lecturers maintain their call for a substantial salary increase to reflect living costs and professional value.\nThe dismissed leaders are key officials of the Association of University Teachers (AUT): President Munyaradzi Chamburuka, Secretary-General Bornface Mwakorera, Organising Secretary Justin Tandire, and Spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi.\nAccording to Vengeyi, the dismissals were based on allegations that the leaders used the university's Great Hall without official approval.
