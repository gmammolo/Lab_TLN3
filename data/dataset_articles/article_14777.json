  "text": "26th June 2025 – (Hong Kong) The Education Bureau has initiated an inquiry into Po Leung Kuk Lo Kit Sing (1983) College in Kwai Tsing after reports emerged of a school-wide Form 4 retest due to the recycling of previous year’s exam questions. During a Form 4 English exam on 3rd June, Principal Law Wing-chung announced a retest, scheduled for 13th June, upon the discovery of identical questions from the previous year’s exam in Paper 1’s reading section.\nAcknowledging the potential stress caused by the retest, Law justified the decision as imperative to ensure a genuine and impartial evaluation of students’ academic abilities.\nOne complainant revealed that students were the first to identify the recurring questions, with the school responding by acknowledging the oversight without assigning blame or issuing a formal apology. Criticism was directed at the school’s inadequate supervision and the psychological strain imposed on students by the prolonged examination period.\nQuestions were raised regarding the impact of retest results on overall grades, questioning the transparency of the assessment process. In response, Law reaffirmed the school’s dedication to exam integrity, emphasising prompt action upon the discovery of duplicated questions. Aside from informing affected students and parents, he assured corrective measures with the faculty and committed to enhancing exam review procedures.\nMeanwhile, the Education Bureau, deeming the issue “serious,” has contacted the school for a comprehensive report, stressing the importance of equitable internal assessments and clear communication between parents and the school. The bureau vowed to investigate any staff misconduct and assured ongoing oversight and assistance.",
