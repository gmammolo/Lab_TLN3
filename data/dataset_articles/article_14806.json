  "text": "Forty-four percent of third, fifth and eighth graders in Waco ISD can do math at grade level? Reading scores are not much better. And, occasionally, we can do better than Bruceville-Eddy ISD [\"STAAR scores mixed in WISD,\" June 21].\nThis has gone on for decades with no improvement. I'll bet if you put the checkout person at H-E-B in a third grade classroom he or she could teach that third grader to do math at grade level more than 40% of the time.\nThis is shameful. Where is the accountability? What other career gives you the option of constantly failing and keeping your job or being promoted? What does the administration and the school board have to say about this? Take a look at the school taxes you're paying and tell me what you're getting for that money.\nAllen Miller III, Waco",
