  "text": "Bridgeen McGlinchey making a presentation to Paula McCartney, Early Years leader, Naíscoil Cholmcille to mark her retirement.\nIt’s the poignant end of a phenomenal era in Irish-medium education (IME) in Derry.\nNaíscoil Cholmcille, which opened in Shantallow Community Centre on March 12, 1984, before moving to Skeoge Industrial Park in September 2013, officially closed yesterday.\nThe nursery, which pioneered IME in the city, marked the occasion with a fun day back at the community centre where it all began - to celebrate its 41 year contribution to Derry’s now burgeoning Irish language school and wider community.\nChairperson Andrew McCartney said the management committee said it had taken the decision to close “with a heavy heart” citing the retirement of Naíscoil Cholmcille leader of 28 years, Paula McCartney, due to ill health, and other factors including “ever increasing running costs”.\nGroup pictured at the 10th anniversary celebrations of Naiscoil Cholmcille. Seated, from left, Bridin Bn Mhic Loinsigh, Teresa Bn Uí Dochartaigh, Padraig Ó Mianain and Leida Ketelaar (founder members). Standing, from left, Charlie Harkin, Liam Ó Faolain, (then committee members), Gearoidin Uí Dhoughaile, Tomas Ó Donghaile (founder members), and Christine Ní Chearuill.\nHe added: “We know that we now leave the Irish-medium education sector in a much better place than when we started out in 1984.\n“We now have three Irish-medium primary schools across the city, in Shantallow, Ballymagroarty and Brandywell, all with statutory nursery units. In addition, a new community based naíscoil has just opened in the Waterside.\n“We are leaving the sector in safe hands and there is plenty of provision for our children in the future.”\nThe last Naíscoil Cholmcille programme children graduating in June 2025.\nSpeaking to The Derry News, Early Years Specialist, Bridgeen McGlinchey, who co-founded Naíscoil Cholmcille and has worked there throughout, described its challenging early days.\n“About two years before we established Naíscoil Cholmcille, we got together a group of Irish speakers which included Tomás Ó Donghaile, Paidi Ó Mianáin, Leon Concheanainn, Brendan Saunders. I was learning Irish at the time.\n“Our other founding members were Teresa Bn Uí Dochartaigh, Leida Ketelaar and Gearoidin Uí Dhoughaile,” she said. “We had meetings in Belfast with Áine Andrews, who was part of the group which started the first gaelscoil in the North, Bunscoil Phobal Feirste, in 1971. Several families had bought a wee group of houses and established that first Irish-medium school in what was known as the Shaw's Road Gaeltacht.\n“We went door-to-door in Derry to see if we would have a good uptake. We also invited a priest up from Dublin to speak about bilingualism. This was very important for parents who were considering placing their children in IME when they didn’t have Irish themselves. We wanted to reassure them and give them the pros and cons of bilingualism.\nConal McGlinchey and Damien Doherty at tThe Safari Park.\n“We faced a lot of hurdles, the biggest one being the constant fundraising. Eventually Naíscoil Cholmcille opened in Shantallow Community Centre which was managed by Gerry Craig at that time,” said Ms McGlinchey, who was its first classroom assistant.\nThe first leader of Naíscoil Cholmcille was Teresa Bn Uí Dochartaigh who was a teacher from Buncrana.\n“We had eight children in the first intake,” recalled Bridgeen McGlinchey. “The following year Teresa left to have a baby and Martin Doherty, from Shantallow, came on board. After that we got Toirealach Ó Gráda.\nShe added: “At the start it was just children from the area but later on Charlie Harkin, who drove a Black Taxi at the time, brought children to Naíscoil Cholmcille from other areas of the city.\n“Thinking back, we seemed to be always fundraising. We did door-to-door collections, sponsored walks, fundraisers. No-one was paid. It was all voluntary. The staff actually brought in the sos (break) - bread, milk, any treats the children were getting, parties.\nA group of Naíscoil Cholmcille children making dinner.\n“Any money collected paid for our heat and light and resources. We received no funding from the Education and Library Board until the late 1990s.\n“Charlie applied for two ACE workers and that is when we employed Paula McCartney and Liam Ó Faolain. Charlie and Kerry Duddy were alos longterm members of staff.\n“In spite of all the hurdles, Naíscoil Cholmcille thrived due to the dedication of staff and parents. What kept us going was a love of the Irish language, that is why people put their heart and soul into it and everything else followed. There was definitely a wee bit of ‘well if Belfast can do it, we can do it too,’” smiled Bridgeen.\nGoing from strength to strength, Naíscoil Cholmcille started its Tús Cinnte programme for two-year-olds in 2009, in conjunction with Surestart Shantallow and has welcomed 12 children onto the programme every year since.\nThe first group of Naíscoil Cholmcille pupils in 1984.\nIn 2011, the naíscoil received funding from Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta, the representative body for Irish medium education in the North and in September 2013, it moved into its new, purpose-built setting in the Northwest Business Complex in Skeoge.\n“Over the years, Naíscoil Cholmcille has received praise and good reports from the Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) and Social Services Inspections and from parents,” said Paula McCartney with evident pride.\n“I have a great sense of satisfaction knowing that children who began their education in Naíscoil Cholmcille are now thriving out in the world. Recently I got a message from one past pupil who is herself now a teacher at a local gaelscoil; it actually made me cry. She said, ‘I got my dream job. I always wanted to be a teacher and if it wasn’t for you, it wouldn’t have happened,’” she added.\n“I am also pleased that over the years Naíscoil Cholmcille has been a feeder school for the three bunscoileanna in Derry: Bunscoil Cholmcille - which was also founded by the group which had the vision and drive to establish Naíscoil Cholmcille - Gaelscoil Na Daroige; and Gaelscoil Éadain Mhóir.\nWinnie O'Grady.\n“In fact, three of my grandchildren and other Naíscoil Cholmcille pupils have also attended Gaelcholáiste Dhoire - the Irish-medium post primary school in Dungiven.\n“Naiscoil Cholmcille has played its part in the success of all of those schools, that is a lovely legacy to have.\n“While I am heartbroken that Naiscoil Cholmcille is closing, I know in my heart there is more than enough Irish-medium education provision in the town, compared to when we started, when there was nothing.\n“Only for Naiscoil Cholmcille, I don’t think the others would have been established. And, what I would really love to see in the future would be meaningful co-ordination and co-operation across the whole Irish-medium education sector in Derry, similar to what is currently happening in County Derry, in Maghera.”\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
