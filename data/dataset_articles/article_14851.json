  "text": "Polish student group gives education ministry failing grade over optional health classes 26.06.2025 13:30 Polish activist group Akcja Uczniowska said on Thursday the Ministry of National Education (MEN) should “repeat the year” after what students called 12 months of missed chances. Photo: ESB Professional/Shutterstock Its year-end report, based on nationwide pupil consultations, denounced the decision to launch health education as a voluntary subject from September 2025. Making it compulsory, the group argued, would give teenagers essential guidance on relationships, violence and mental wellbeing. A December 2024 Warsaw protest and criticism from Poland’s Catholic bishops escalated the row, prompting Education Minister Barbara Nowacka to keep the class optional, partly to shield teachers from “hate and disinformation”. The students also attacked plans to let schools ban smartphones, urging lessons in “responsible, safe use” instead. Deputy minister Katarzyna Lubnauer expects the measure to reach parliament in July and take effect during the 2025/26 year. Akcja Uczniowska’s wishlist extends to free lunches for every pupil, a uniform 51 per cent fare cut on public transport for pupils and students, free upper-secondary textbooks and a leaner curriculum. A trimmed syllabus introduced this year will be fully overhauled in stages from September 2026. (jh) Source: PAP",
