  "text": "Published :\nUpdated :\nStudents of Brojomohun (BM) College in Barishal locked all departments demanding fulfilment of their five-point demand, including the solution to the accommodation crisis.\nThe students also submitted a memorandum to the Divisional Commissioner as part of their movement.\nStudents said they placed the five-point demand to ensure a standard academic environment on campus.\nDespite having over 30,000 students, the college lacks adequate housing facilities, and the existing ones are in poor condition, they alleged.\nDuring rainfall, waterlogging severely disrupts movement on campus, they said, adding that proper drainage and road repairs are urgently needed.\nThe students announced that their agitation will continue until the demands are met.\nFollowing a request from the college principal, they gave a three-working-day ultimatum.\nIf effective steps are not taken within this period, the students warned of an intensified movement, including the shutdown of all academic and administrative activities except for the admission process.\nEarlier in the day, students blocked the road for five hours as part of their protest.\nContacted, College Principal Dr Taizul Islam said, \"I have talked to the students and got three days' time. Discussions are ongoing with the administration to resolve the issues. I hope for a positive outcome.\"",
