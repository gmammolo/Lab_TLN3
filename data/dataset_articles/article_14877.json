  "text": "The results of the 2025 Panhellenic Examinations for candidates in general and vocational high schools across the country were announced shortly after noon.\nIn the first field of Humanities, 53.31% of the candidates scored below par in History, 47.69% below par in Ancient Greek, while the performance was better in Latin (six out of ten candidates scored above the base 10) and in Language, where 84.66% of the candidates scored above the base.\n84.66% (84.66%) of the total score was above the pass mark.\nA significant number of candidates (45.52%) from the 3rd Health Studies Field of Study fell below the pass mark in Physics. 54.06% of candidates from the 2nd Science Field of Science Studies scored above the pass mark in Physics.\nAlso, in the 2nd Field, most of the candidates scored above 10 in Mathematics, as well as from the 3rd Field, the majority scored above 10 in Biology and Chemistry.\nIn the 4th Field of Computer Science Studies, there was no surprise this year either, as most scored below 10 in Mathematics.\nThe performance of candidates in the 1st Humanities Field 1 in History was disappointing, with most of them scoring below 10.\nIn contrast, there were a significant number of candidates who exceeded the pass mark in Language.\nAsk me anything\nExplore related questions",
