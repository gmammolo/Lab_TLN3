  "text": "The latest data book for child well-being has been released, and Wyoming has fallen back down in the rankings.\nThe Kids Count Data Book is produced by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which works to improve outcomes for children through grants, research and advocacy. The annual publication reports on major issues impacting children, especially those that affect or lead to changes in poverty levels. However, the rankings are relative to how other states are doing.\nCurrently, Wyoming ranks 23, which is five places lower than last year.\nInformation in the Kids Count Databook lags by about one to two years, so this year’s report includes data from 2023 and 2024.\nThe new data shows that compared to 2019, there are more kids in poverty, more students not being proficient in reading or math, more teen obesity and more children in single-parent families.\nPeople are also reading…\nHowever, there are some positive changes. Compared to 2019, there were fewer teen births, fewer children without health insurance and fewer children and teen deaths.\nReality check\nBecause the information lags by two years in some cases, it may not accurately reflect the current state of data. For example, auto enrollment for Medicaid began during COVID but fell off in 2024. As a result, there is a chance the number of children without health insurance is much higher than what the data book is able to reflect.\nMicah Richardson, assistant director of policy for the Wyoming Women’s Association, said trying to determine whether there’ an expectation of seeing more kids in that category is “tricky.”\n“So it’s tricky to say because when we don’t have the data yet for the unwinding, and then two, we don’t know what the cuts look like yet at that federal level, so we’re kind of in this space of uncertainty.”\nHere's a quick look into health news as of late, including how potential Medicaid cuts could affect Wyoming and a matched fundraiser for Wyoming Rescue Mission.\nThe Wyoming Women’s Association is one of multiple foundations under the Wyoming Community Foundation, which is the state partner for the Annie E. Casey Foundation.\nRichardson noted that while Wyoming has the fewest kids in the nation living in high-poverty areas, it still has 19,000 children in poverty.\n“We look at that, and that is like such a great thing, and to think, ‘Boy, that’s something we should be happy about and celebrate.’ But then on the flip side of that there, if you look at the data again, in a different area, we still have 19,000 children in Wyoming living in poverty.”\nBetween 2019 and 2023, only 1% of Wyoming children lived in high-poverty areas, according to the report.\nData trends\nWhile comparing data to 2019 gives a broader look at how the state has changed, it is also important to note the trends do not always consistently go upward or downward.\nFor example, while Wyoming is still worse off in the number of children living in homes with a high housing cost burden than the state was in 2019, that number has dropped since last year’s data book.\nIn regards to child and teen deaths, there were 48 in Wyoming in 2023 which is better than the 51 in 2019, but it is also significantly better than the 58 in 2022.\nThe data fluctuates every year, and so does the state’s ranking as a result.\nLocal resources\nIn Natrona County, there are various food banks, shelters and other organizations working to help those who are at or below the federal poverty line.\nOne of those organizations is the Community Action Partnership of Natrona County. It provides healthcare for the homeless, emergency services, case management, housing readiness workshops and referrals for other programs in the area.\n“The KIDS COUNT indicators significantly influence the operations of the Community Action Partnership of Natrona County (CAPNC),” Kelly Wessels, executive director of CAPNC, wrote in an email to the Star-Tribune.\nWessels said if the data indicators on poverty continue to trend upward, it will create an increased demand for services while federal, state and local governments are projecting financial reductions in support.\nShe added that there could be issues with not having enough staff members to cover the needs of case management or in-depth support services. As a result, she said CAPNC would need to expand partnerships and push for more funding.\n“Although worsening indicators can help justify the need for more funding, obtaining it remains a competitive and time-consuming process,” Wessels wrote.\nAllison Allsop is the education and health reporter for the Casper Star-Tribune.
