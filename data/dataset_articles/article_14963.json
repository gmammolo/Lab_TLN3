  "text": "I AM GETTING TIRED of hearing the word “crisis”.\nEvery time I look at a story, the word is in big, bold letters. Teachers are saying education is in a crisis mode, doctors are saying health care is facing a crisis, with major shortages of doctors and nurses creating a shutdown of emergency facilities in smaller communities because doctors and nurses need a day off too (who knew?) And many times, there isn’t another body to fill in. And sometimes they even want two days off in a row. They sure are getting greedy, aren’t they? The list of crises amongst our Aboriginal peoples isn’t getting any shorter.\nTo continue, there’s a crisis in the U.S. where the government is rounding up immigrants, legal or not, and shipping them out to God knows where. Jews and Muslims are still fighting over lands they’ve fought over for centuries. With Iran’s involvement, that is now a crisis.\nDonald Trump, who has aspirations to become the next Pope, if not the next God to be idolized and worshipped, has thrown the world into crisis mode with his tariff economy. Do I have time to get into the large number of environmental crises we’re facing? Another day? OK.\nAs much as I hate that word, it is appropriate to all of the things I’ve mentioned. The Cambridge Dictionary gives this meaning for “crisis:”\n”In crisis-experiencing a time of great difficulty, danger, or suffering.”\nAnd continuing to strip the money tree is simply whitewashing these issues. I don’t know if there are any other words that we can use.\nHmm… I wonder what the word “ostrich” means?\nI’m Doug Collins and that’s One Man’s Opinion.\n——\nEditor’s Note: This opinion piece reflects the views of its author, and does not necessarily represent the views of CFJC Today or Pattison Media.",
