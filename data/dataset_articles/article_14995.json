  "text": "Millions of Americans are now staring down a financial nightmare as student loan delinquencies skyrocket.\nAccording to new data, nearly six million borrowers are currently over 90 days late on their federal student loan payments, placing them at serious risk of default, and some could soon lose up to 15% of their paycheck due to wage garnishment. The $1.69 trillion in federal student loan debt has become a massive burden on U.S. households, especially as high inflation, stagnant wages, and soaring interest rates continue to squeeze budgets.\nTransUnion’s latest analysis shows a dramatic rise in delinquency since February, with 31% of student loan borrowers now past due, an all-time high. Back in early 2020, just before the pandemic hit, that number hovered around 12%. But as pandemic-era pauses and protections have lifted, the financial fallout is becoming clear. About two million of these newly delinquent borrowers could be in default as soon as July, with another million hitting that mark by August, having missed payments for over 270 days.\nOnce a borrower enters default, the government doesn’t waste time. Penalties kick in fast, tax refunds can be seized, Social Security benefits slashed, and disability checks reduced. But the biggest sting comes from the paycheck itself. The federal government is allowed to garnish up to 15% of a person’s wages to collect the debt. In fact, 195,000 defaulted borrowers were just sent notices from the Treasury Department last month, warning them that their federal benefits may be withheld starting in June.\nThe reason for the uptick is a messy mix: more students enrolling, higher tuition costs, stagnant income, and people still recovering from the pandemic economy. Add inflation to the mix and it’s easy to see why borrowers are falling behind. For many, these loans aren’t just an inconvenience, they’re crushing. With the average federal student loan debt per borrower sitting at $38,375, even those trying to stay afloat are finding it harder to keep up.\nEven borrowers who haven’t defaulted yet are paying a price. Falling into delinquency drops your credit score, an average hit of about 60 points, according to TransUnion. That alone can make it nearly impossible to secure a credit card, home loan, or even rent an apartment. And those who do get approved may face brutally high interest rates.\nIt’s a warning sign the government isn’t ignoring. The resumption of federal collections was authorized under the Trump administration in early May, marking the end of pandemic-era relief programs. Now, the Department of Education is ramping up pressure to recover billions in unpaid loans.\nExperts are urging borrowers to act fast. Once the garnishment process begins, undoing it is complicated, and by then, your paycheck is already smaller. There’s still time for delinquent borrowers to avoid default, but the window is closing quickly.\nMeanwhile, those struggling to keep up are being hit from every direction. Households are balancing rent hikes , high grocery prices, and rising energy bills, leaving little room to make loan payments. As the cost of living crisis continues, many feel like they’re sinking with no lifeline in sight.",
