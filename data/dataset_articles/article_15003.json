  "text": "Text to speech audio articles made possible by the Quest Grant at Yavapai College. Tuition free industry recognized certificates for your career.\n|\nMotivating high school students in Arizona to pursue a college degree, Univision Arizona—a leading Spanish-language broadcaster—partnered with NAU to create and launch the “Tu Futuro” (“Your Future”) scholarship program. The scholarship program is part of the Univision Arizona Contigo community empowerment initiative. It provides an Arizona student with a scholarship to NAU, covering the total cost of a four-year undergraduate tuition and lodging.\nNAU is one of the top 10 producers in the country for Hispanic students’ bachelor’s degrees. Recognized as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), NAU is doubling down on its commitment to educational attainment by bolstering grant funding and additional resources for the diverse student community. NAU’s Office of Scholarship and Financial Aid will match Univision Arizona’s gift each year, providing a corresponding scholarship to an undergraduate student, doubling the impact.\n“Univision Arizona is honored to partner with Northern Arizona to award this four-year essay-based full-ride scholarship. Education is the key to the future of our community, and Univision Arizona is committed to taking measurable steps to provide educational opportunities,” said Mark Masepohl, President and Regional General Manager at Univision Arizona.\nThe partnership and support from Univision Arizona elevate NAU as an HSI, reinforcing support systems for the university’s valued students.\n“The NAU Foundation is incredibly thankful to Univision Arizona for investing in our students and strengthening NAU’s designation as a Hispanic-Serving Institution,” said Nick Lobjeko, Vice President of NAU Advancement and CEO of the NAU Foundation. “Their commitment to student success creates access and opportunities for students to persist in their pursuit of a college degree.”\nIncoming first-year students for the fall 2025 school year can apply for the scholarship between December 2, 2024, and April 15, 2025, by submitting a 250-word essay describing the profound impact their college degree will have on both their personal trajectory and the Hispanic community at large.
