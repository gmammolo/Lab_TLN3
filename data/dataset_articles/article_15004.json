  "text": "– Many teachers today find they have little time for an increasing number of tasks. It can go beyond the ability to see and track students who need it, education policy spokesperson and Venstre deputy leader Abid Raja tells NTB.\nToday, contact teachers have one hour a week that they can use to supervise students. The money the Liberal Party is proposing in its 2025 alternative budget would give teachers an extra hour a week starting next school year. On an annual basis, the measure will cost over two billion Norwegian kroner.\n– The teacher is one of the most important input factors in children’s education. For Venstre it is therefore important that teachers have more time to dedicate to students and this is why we are investing heavily in this concrete measure, explains Raja.\nRaja emphasizes that it is the parts of working life that negotiate the framework that determines how much time teachers have for the contact teacher function.\n– But when we know how important the role the contact teacher plays in solving the challenges we see in schools today, it is important that politicians also look at what means can be made available to give municipalities and county councils the opportunity to give the teacher more time to be a contact teacher, says Raja.\nIn his opinion, too many arrows point in the wrong direction in Norwegian schools.\n– There are various reasons for this, but what is certain is that to solve these challenges, to ensure that students grow and complete their education, money and measures are needed. I don’t think this government takes these challenges seriously enough, so we have to, he says.\n#liberals #give #teachers #time #students #allocate #million #Norwegian #kroner",
