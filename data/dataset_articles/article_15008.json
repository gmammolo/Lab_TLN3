  "text": "Submitted by Stephen Dunne on December 5, 2024 - 12:49pm\nInterested in education equity in US public schools? Want to tutor in local k-12 public schools for course credit?\nThe Community Engagement and Leadership Education (CELE) Center offers courses for UW students to earn academic credit while tutoring in K-12 schools and/or mentoring! If you are interested in educational equity and gaining direct-service experience working with K-12 students, then we encourage you to enroll in our courses.\nOur courses are variable credit, count towards the ELS and Leadership minors, and are graded CR/NC.\nTo get started, consider registering for the below classes on MyPlan:\nEDUC 260: Equity Issues in K-12 Education (1 credit)\nWhen: EDUC 260 B Mondays 10:00-11:20 am\nEDUC 260 A Mondays 1:00 - 2:20 pm\nModality: In-Person\nEDUC 260 is a community-engaged course designed to prepare University of Washington students for a mentoring and tutoring relationship with K-12 students at local partner schools, either in an academic tutor or a post-secondary planning capacity. The course's purpose is to strengthen student consciousness of self, systems, and community to be applied to practice. *Pre/co-requisite course for EDUC 401. If students have completed sufficient coursework in ed equity-related topics, we may be able to waive 260 co-req. Please email with questions.\nEDUC 401 A/B: Practicum in Community Service Activity (1-6 credits)\nWhen: A Section BIWEEKLY on Wednesdays, 11:30 am-12:50 pm\nB Section BIWEEKLY on Wednesdays, 4:00 pm-5:20 pm\nModality: In-Person\nCredit variable: (1-6)\nEDUC 401 A and B are CELE community-engaged courses designed to prepare University of Washington students for an academic tutoring or mentoring relationship with K-12 students at local partner K-12 schools. Students will be matched with a volunteer site, or can choose their own site, and will volunteer on a weekly basis. Tutors will build teaching and student support skills through coursework and in-person volunteering. EDUC 401 classes are meant for students to reflect on their direct community engagement experience. If you are already mentoring or tutoring and would like to earn credit for those hours, you should inquire about self-placement! Credit is earned through attendance, assignments, and the completion of required service hours (to be fulfilled through tutoring at schools and professional development sessions).\n*Pre/co-requisite: EDUC 260. If students have completed sufficient coursework in equity-related topics, we may be able to waive 260 co-req.
