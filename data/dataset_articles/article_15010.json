  "text": "By Special to the EagleHerald ,\n1 hours ago\nPESHTIGO — Peshtigo Middle school band students have been participating in a musical composition project called ComMission Possible with support from the Beyond the Notes Music Festival. To encourage musical composing creativity in students, the ComMission Possible project puts professional musical composers with students. Schools who chose to participate are provided with activities to encourage creativity, to submit song ideas, and to be included in the process of writing new music with professional composers.\nStudents are placed in the center of the creative process.\n“Even though we think of music as one of the most creative subjects in schools, often band teachers direct things so much that students’ creativity isn’t utilized as much as it could be,” explained teacher Marcus Weilander. “Being able to dive into music together as a team to make music come alive is so fun. Seeing the crowd go wild, it’s my greatest joy in life”\nWeilander became familiar with the ComMission Possible project as a college student.\n“It was founded by Chris Gleason, a fantastic educator from Sun Prairie (Wisconsin),” he said. “He gave a presentation to music education students at UW-Stevens Point when I was there and I really love the concept.”\nThe project provides activities to encourage music education students to submit song proposals.\nOver 300 students nationwide submitted song proposals. The submission process includes students writing a few paragraphs explaining their song idea and how they would make a good piece of music, and recording themselves in a video explaining the concept to the selection committee at ComMission Possible.\nOne of the Peshtigo students who submitted an idea was Lydia WIlliams, who had the idea to compose a song about the Peshtigo Fire of 1871.\n“It was a tragic event that killed over 2,500 people but barely anyone knows about this tragedy,” she said. “I thought this would be a great opportunity to spread awareness about this terrible event.”\nStudent Elliot Lemire submitted a proposal suggesting a song about the five stages of grief.\n“Denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance are universal experiences after a loss,” he said. “I thought about how a piece could bring people together. At our lowest points, we rely on each other to become uplifted.”\nLemire’s song idea about grief was chosen by songwriter Jerod Hall. “I suggested to the composer that the piece should tell a story or adventure,” Lemire said.“It should take those who listen on a journey together through grief, with each part representing the different stages of grief. I also wanted to shine a light on the fact that when experiencing grief, we are not alone. The piece would represent countless lives who have faced the everyday tragedy that is death.”\n“A few weeks ago we learned that Elliot’s song idea was one of the top 15 song ideas being considered by Jarod Hall, a former teacher who now composes music professionally.” Weilander explained, “On the day of the announcement, our kids were really excited. When watching the announcement video where they learned that Jarod will be writing the song about grief they started cheering.”\nMembers of the Peshtigo Middle School Band will receive regular video check-ins from the composer sharing the creative process of composing music. Students will be able to interact with Hall, asking questions. Hall has shared the song’s title as “Toc,” referring to the tick tock sound of a clock. They will also receive a digital copy of the completed composition and Peshtigo Middle/High School will be listed in the score. An exclusive regional premiere of the song titled “Toc” will be performed at 5:30 pm May 5 during the spring band concert at Peshtigo Middle/High School.\nBoth Williams and Lemire shared their experiences being part of band. “Music has been a huge part of my life,” Williams said. “It’s a way to reach people and touch them in a way that sometimes words can’t.”\nWilliams plays the flute in the school band and with her youth worship team, and feels that it’s “helped her make deeper friendships and grow in her faith.”\nLemire plays the saxophone and discusses the benefits of band. “You create many friendships and memories, and become a talented artist with the guidance of others,” he said. “Band class has brought me nothing but good memories, fun, and a community of kind people.”",
