  "text": "For over 15 years, we have collaborated with New River College in Islington to inspire students and encourage positive life choices. The school supports young people aged 11 to 16 who have been excluded or are at risk of exclusion from mainstream education.\nMany of these students face significant challenges, including special educational needs, traumatic experiences, and risks of criminal exploitation or gang involvement. Through this partnership, Arsenal’s programmes provide students with opportunities to develop essential interpersonal skills, foster teamwork, and envision brighter futures.\nThe partnership’s impact was recently celebrated during Arsenal’s 3-0 victory over Nottingham Forest, where the school was awarded a No More Red white shirt. This symbolic gesture, now proudly displayed at New River College, reflects the shared commitment to creating opportunities for young people.\nOur No More Red initiative, in partnership with adidas offers vital safe spaces to play sport, access to trusted role models, and a sense of belonging, providing opportunities and access for young people to prosper.\nNew River College’s commitment to its students is further supported by external agencies such as CAMHS, Safer Schools, and Islington Early Help Children’s Services. As a trauma-informed school, it offers a nurturing environment that helps students cultivate positive attitudes towards learning and relationships. The goal is clear: to ensure every student feels safe, valued, and prepared for a healthy, successful future.\nFreddie Hudson, head of Arsenal in the Community said: “Our partnership with Islington alternative education provision stretches back to 2004. Since then, our staff have been a constant presence each week. Working alongside committed New River College staff, we see first-hand the positive learning environment created for students and the important role models we are able to provide together.”\nCllr Michelline Safi-Ngongo, Islington Council’s Executive Member for Children, Young People and Families, said: “New River College provides fantastic support for some of the most vulnerable young learners in Islington, truly making a difference and helping them to achieve their best. This shirt is a symbol of the potent positive impact the college has on young people’s lives, and I can’t think of a more deserving organisation to be the first to receive such an honour.\n“The No More Red programme exemplifies genuine, truly meaningful partnership working; we’re proud and privileged to have Arsenal support us in our journey to make Islington the best place for children and young people to go to school, learn and live.”\nCopyright 2024 The Arsenal Football Club Limited.
