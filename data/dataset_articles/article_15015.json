  "text": "Oklahoma State’s early signing day went mostly according to plan, and 19 future Cowboys signed their letters of intent Wednesday morning.\nThe one hiccup came from former three-star quarterback commit Jett Niu, who flipped his commitment Bedlam style early Wednesday morning by signing with the Sooners. On the flip side of the flips, OSU picked up a commitment from Muskogee offensive lineman Miguel Chaves – previously committed to UNLV before late Tuesday night.\nOf the 19 players signed, 11 are on offense and eight are on defense with three guys coming from JUCO. Nine of the 19 are expected to be on campus next month as early enrollees.\nChandavian Bradley, edge rusher, 6-foot-4, 242 pounds - Hutchinson C.C.\nBradley might be OSU’s best pickup in the entire signing class. He comes to Stillwater from Hutchinson Community College in Kansas, where he’s the No. 1 ranked JUCO edge rusher in the class and the No. 13 overall JUCO prospect.\nPrior to his one season at Hutchinson, Bradley was the No. 84 overall prospect out of high school and committed to Tennessee over Texas A&M, South Carolina, LSU and many other power four programs.\nThis season, he was named an all-conference honorable mention in the KJCCC, and he recorded 23 tackles with 6.0 tackles for loss as a redshirt freshman. He has three years of eligibility left and will be an early enrollee. Oklahoma State has plenty of need for defensive line help with the departure of Colin Oliver, and Bradley could see the field early on in replacement.\nRashod Bradley, defensive end, 6-foot-3, 255 pounds - East Mississippi C.C.\nAnother defensive lineman from JUCO with the last name Bradley joined the class leading up to signing day.\nBradley picked OSU over Arkansas, South Florida, North Texas and others, and with his frame and experience he could factor in on the defensive line early on, like the other Bradley.\nIn two seasons at East Mississippi C.C., he combined for 32 tackles and 6.0 tackles for loss. Bradley has two years of eligibility left and will be on campus this spring.\nDraden Fullbright, cornerback, 5-foot-11, 175 pounds - North Crowley, Texas\nFullbright flipped to Oklahoma State from Tulsa just two days before signing day. He will enter a DB room that is set to lose Korie Black, Trey Rucker, Lyrik Rawls, Willie Nelson and others.\nPrior to his time at North Crowley, where he has helped lead it to the state regional finals this year, Fullbright played in Wayne County, Georgia, contributing at defensive back and running back. In 2024, he was listed as a Fort Worth Star-Telegram top-100 area player.\nFullbright is a three-star recruit who had an impressive offer sheet – including offers from Georgia, USC, Florida State and others. He will not be an early enrollee.\nRoyal Cappel, wide receiver, 5-foot-11, 175 - Cibolo (Steele), Texas\nIt will be interesting to see how this shakes out after the firing of OC/WR coach Kasey Dunn, but should Cappel stick around in Stillwater, he has plenty of upside.\nCappel’s frame and track speed (ran a 10.99 in the 100m last year) projects him as a slot receiver – where he produced for Cibolo in his senior year. Cappel racked up 1,200 yards and 13 receiving touchdowns, and he also averaged more than 30 yards per return on special teams.\nHe is a three-star recruit and picked OSU over Baylor, Missouri, Oklahoma and plenty others. Cappel is another early enrollee.\nChase Pinkston, defensive back, 6-feet, 195 pounds - Jones C.C.\nPinkston was a signing day commit and signee for the Pokes. He played one season at Jones, where he recorded 26 tackles, three interceptions and a fumble recovery as a true freshman.\nHe was a three-star prospect out of Oak Grove High School in Mississippi and had interest from OSU but no official offer. After his one season at a JUCO, Pinkston was re-evaluated by the Cowboys and they offered.\nIt’s worth noting that Pinkston’s father, Todd, is the running backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.\nMichael Riles, edge rusher, 6-foot-4, 245 pounds - Port Arthur, Texas\nRiles is the second-highest rated recruit in OSU’s signing class.\nWith his size and speed around the edge, schools such as Texas A&M, Florida, Texas and others all offered – but he stuck with Oklahoma State.\nRiles is the No. 52 rated player in Texas and will arrive on campus in the fall.\nCarl’Veon Young, linebacker, 6-foot-4, 215 pounds - Midwest City, Oklahoma\nOklahoma State’s highest rated recruit is an in-state recruit from Carl Albert.\nYoung has shot up the recruiting rankings in the last month, going from the No. 407 nationally ranked player to No. 219 as of signing day. In October, Young was an unrated recruit, and now he is a four-star.\nAt linebacker, Young describes himself as a versatile player that can be a factor in stopping the run and dropping back in coverage on pass plays. Young is looking to win a third straight state championship at Carl Albert, and he has more than 60 tackles with two sacks and an interception this season.\nYoung is the latest example of Oklahoma State finding a hidden gem before the rest of the country finds him. OSU was his only offer even on signing day – and as a four star recruit that’s almost unheard of.\nDJ Dugar, running back, 6-foot-1, 205 pounds - Leander, Texas\nDugar brings an interesting story with him to Oklahoma State.\nIn three seasons at Tom Glen High School, Dugar carried the ball 533 times for 3,800 yards and 48 touchdowns, but he did not play his senior season. In August, Dugar’s quarterback tore his ACL in a scrimmage. After watching that happen, Dugar took it as a sign to sit out his last year and not risk injury himself after so many carries his first three seasons.\nSo Dugar will come to Stillwater in January without having taken a carry in more than 12 months. The resumé and the accolades (two-time district player of the year) speak for themselves, but he’ll have to acclimate to competitive reps again. He was a three-star recruit and chose OSU over Arkansas, Kansas State, Missouri and others.",
