Brad Schneider said in a statement.\nFind out what's happening in Lake Forest-Lake Bluffwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nLaunched in 2018, the STEAM — science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics — Scholars program offers motivated high school students hands-on learning experiences in fields related to their academic and professional interests throughout the course of an academic year.\n“The 10th district is home to many world-class industries and institutions that offer exceptional career opportunities,” Schneider said.\nFind out what's happening in Lake Forest-Lake Bluffwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\n“Our first stop at Abbott Laboratories gave students a chance to see scientists working in the virology lab researching infectious diseases and hear how they are working to prevent the next pandemic,” he said.\nDuring the program, students visit four local STEAM-focused businesses and institutions to connect with professionals, educators and business leaders.\nThe scholars selected for this year’s program represent a range of schools and communities across the district, including:\nAdlai E. Stevenson High School\nAmritha Praveen, Samarth Donapati, Rhubyn Letuchy, Shivaani Sivaraman\nAntioch Community High School\nJack Johnson, Samantha Pickard\nCarmel Catholic High School\nKatherine Anen\nDeerfield High School\nCharlie Marks, Jesse Feldman, Ella Gil, Sarah Holzman\nGlenbrook North High School\nJake Semmelhack, Liora Kalinovskiy, Paul Sever, Luke Davidson\nGrant Community High School\nNicole Sak, Vani Patel, Sophie Lelchuk, Izabela Podgorski\nGrayslake Central High School\nEvelyn White\nJohnsburg High School\nJoshua Kaunas\nLake Forest High School\nKatherine McCann, Jimena Garcia De Leaniz Hernandez, Emerson Brown\nLakes Community High School\nAurelia Carraro, Daniel Garcia\nNew Trier High School\nCooper Cohen, Kate Kang, Jack Fisher, Connall Gill\nVernon Hills High School\nKyle Kim, Ryan Stukel, Laasya Manikonda\nWarren Township High School\nJiya Shah\nRound Lake High School\nJulian Amador, Briseia Ortega\nLast month, Schneider was reelected to his sixth term in Congress and subsequently picked by his colleagues to chair the New Democrat coalition, which is made up of over a hundred centrist House Democrats.\n“This past election, New Dems showed how Democrats can connect with voters and win in states all across the country,” he said after the vote.\n“New Dem members and candidates held swing-district seats and flipped red seats blue, narrowing what was already one of the thinnest GOP majorities in history,” Schneider added. “When Congress reconvenes in January, New Dems will number at least 108 members, counting more than half of the Democratic Caucus in our ranks.“\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/illinois/lakeforest/subscribe)",
