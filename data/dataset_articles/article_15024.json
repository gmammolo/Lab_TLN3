  "text": "Mississippi College and The W partner on accelerated law degree program\nMississippi University for Women students who seek to become attorneys have an accelerated pathway into the legal profession thanks to a newly signed partnership with Mississippi College.\nMississippi University for Women and the Mississippi College School of Law signed a Memorandum of Understanding agreement on Nov. 21, allowing qualified W students to enter MC’s Juris Doctorate program before fully completing a bachelor’s degree from The W.\nThis accelerated pathway shortens the total length of undergraduate studies plus law school by one full year. MC President Blake Thompson and W President Nora Miller signed the Memorandum of Understanding together with W Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Scott Tollison, MC Provost and Executive Vice President Mike Highfield and MC Law Dean John Anderson.\n“The W continues to forge affordable and impactful partnerships that benefit Mississippi. This innovative collaboration between MC and The W offers students an efficient and cost-effective pathway to pursue advanced legal education,” said W President Nora Miller.\nStudents at The W who have completed 75% of the coursework required for a bachelor’s degree will be eligible for admission to MC Law. The partnership will initially feature developed pathways in business administration, English, history, legal studies and political science. After the student successfully completes the first 30 hours (one year) of the J.D. program, The W will award the appropriate bachelor’s degree to the student. Then, after completing requirements for the J.D. degree, MC Law will award the professional diploma.\nMC Law will accept applications through March 31 for admission to the entering class for the following fall semester, which begins each August.\n“This new partnership between The W and MC Law allows us to better serve Mississippi students attending The W with a pathway to a degree program at Mississippi’s only capital city law school. This partnership helps to keep our brightest students and brightest future lawyers in the state,” said Thompson.\nHighfield added, “This agreement underscores MC’s dedication to academic innovation and collaboration. By partnering with our peer institutions across Mississippi, MC is providing students with a seamless transition from rigorous undergraduate studies to an advanced legal education, saving both time and financial resources while preparing them for impactful careers in the legal profession.”\nStudents enrolled in the 3+3 program must be admitted to MC Law. They will apply to the law school program using the application process provided by the Law School Admissions Council (LSAC). Letters of recommendations are not required but strongly recommended.\n“MC Law is well underway with its multi-million-dollar renovation of the entire campus. Mississippi University for Women students admitted through this new 3+3 program will be welcomed to a beautiful new state-of-the-art law school campus that focuses on meeting the needs of the 21st -century law student. And these new students will enjoy the opportunity to study and learn from the nation’s top legal scholars, all in the heart of our state’s capital city\", said Anderson.\nThe accelerated program meets the requirements of the American Bar Association.\nMC Law has been preparing leaders for the legal profession since 1930 in Jackson, where the State Capitol, Mississippi Supreme Court, federal courts and many of Mississippi’s most respected law firms are nearby, giving students practical experience in the field before graduation.\nLearn more about Mississippi College Law at [https://law.mc.edu/](https://law.mc.edu/)\nLearn more about The W at [https://www.muw.edu/about/](https://www.muw.edu/about/)\nSign-up For Our Newsletter\nGet the latest news about Mississippi College delivered right to your inbox by subscribing to the Along College Street e-newsletter.",
