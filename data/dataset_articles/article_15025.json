  "text": "By Dashal Mentzel ,\n4 hours ago\nLA CROSSE, Wis. (WLAX/WEUX) – The La Crosse Public Education Foundation and the School District of La Crosse are creating two grants totaling $88,000 that look to commit to reading instruction and learning.\nThe first part of the grant is $51,000 which will give all kindergarten through second-grade classrooms sets of decodable books. The school district says these books will help students engage in targeted reading practice and build foundational skills. School District of La Crosse Literary Specialist, Melissa Ender, explains, “Early literacy is where the magic happens. We need to catch kids early and when their brains are developing. We want to begin that process as early as kindergarten. We want our kids to be proficient leaders by the time they enter 3rd grade because typically around that time is when we shift from learning to read to using those reading skills and putting that into reading to learn.”\nThe other $37,000 will go towards giving over 20 3rd through 5th grade teachers morphology literacy training. According to La Crosse Public Education Foundation Executive Director, Nell Saunders-Scott, “Morphology is a targeted training that helps later elementary students continue their literacy education. Having teachers highly trained in that means that they’ll be better able to support their students who are continuing to learn literacy skills so that they can move from learning to read to reading to learn.”\nSchool District of La Crosse Superintendent Aaron Engel says these grants are part of the foundation’s and school district’s initiative to work in the science of reading. “As we roll out that initiative, it’s been incredibly beneficial to have access to these resources sooner than we ever would have. This is both in terms of the books that we’re able to provide to our students, as well as the training for our teachers.”\nEngel says, that while technology is a big part of modern education, reading is still important as well for young students. “Technology certainly has its place, and we need to train our students for the ways of the future. But at the end of the day, the physical reading in a book is really engaging for a lot of our students. We’re thankful to have these resources here in our classrooms to provide that engaging activity for students.” The books that students receive are paired text, meaning there is a fiction and non-fiction version of each story topic.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
