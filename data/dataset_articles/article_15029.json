  "text": "RUNNER OF THE YEAR Kaitlyn Reese, Avon\nThe junior has run in five individual races on the state-meet level — three in cross country and two in track — and five times she has earned All-Ohio honors. This past cross country season she ran an exceptionally fast time of 17:35.50 in the Division I state race, good for seventh place as the Eagles finished 12th as a team. During the season she won the OHSAA Early Season Invitational as well as the Strongsville and Centerville invitationals, and she also crossed the line first in the Southwestern Conference meet and the district meet.\nCOACH OF THE YEAR Dee Zeurcher, Rocky River\nIt took a while for the Pirates to recover from the graduation of their top runner from a year ago, but when all the pieces came together, they were one of the top teams not only in the area, but in Ohio. They won invitational titles at Mentor and Medina. In the postseason, they won the inaugural Cleveland West Conference title and placed second at districts, fifth at regionals and 17 th in the state in Division I.\nFIRST TEAM Erin Belveal, Bay While most top runners like to be near the front right from the start, the senior shows exceptional patience, often not working her way up to the leaders until the final mile. She just missed earning All-Ohio honors in the Division II state meet, placing 38th with a 19:03.40 clocking.\nGrace Lavelle, Rocky River Known more for her exploits on the track as a two-time All-Ohioan, the senior not only won the first cross country race of her life this year in the CWC meet, but she also led the Pirates to another state meet berth.\nBrooklyn Marriott, Bay Saving her best race for last, the senior narrowly missed All-Ohio honors by about 10 seconds, placing 37th in the Division II state meet in 19:03.02.\nAva Melott, Avon The sophomore was consistently the No. 2 runner on the best team in the area, earning top-10 finishes in the SWC meet and the district meet and placing 43rd at regionals and 95th at the state meet.\nJane Rathbun, Rocky River A steady presence up front for the Pirates, the senior ran perhaps the best race of the season at the state meet, placing 59th in 19:04.04.\nSECOND TEAM Katherine Low, Amherst: Also a second team selection last year, the senior placed sixth in the SWC meet and followed that up by being 20th at districts and 50th at regionals.\nJane McCann, Rocky River: The lone freshman on this team, she had a strong postseason, placing fourth in the CWC, 10th at districts, 53rd at regionals and 85th in the state meet with a 19:17.55 clocking.\nOlivia Pajak, Avon: The junior had perhaps her best race in the regional meet, placing 27th with a time of 19:45.39 on a challenging course. She also was fifth in the SWC meet and 11th in the district meet.\nJessica Pendleton, Avon: A member of Avon’s 4×800 relay that was third in the state last spring, the junior provided quality depth for a team that placed 12th in the state.\nHONORABLE MENTION Amherst: Nora Darkow, Sophia Pecora; Avon: Carolina Reed, Anika Singh; Avon Lake: Cassidy Valerino; Brookside: Emma Palmer; Elyria: Tori Bell; Elyria Catholic: Gracie Jones; Fairview: Meghan McDonald; Firelands: Dilynn Copley, Audrey Smith, Natalie Smith; Lake Ridge: Emma Calkins; Oberlin: Aubrey Abeyta, Courage Bielawski, Olivia Hudson; Olmsted Falls: Aubrey Prada, Abby Thompson; Open Door: Claire Hepner; Rocky River: Anna Buehrle, Brooke Hogan, Lauren Lavelle, Katie Stirm; Wellington: Lauren Vannatter; Westlake: Molly Garcia, Maggie Hennessey, Julia Richards.",
