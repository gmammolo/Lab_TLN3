  "text": "Eight players from Lancaster County schools have earned All-State honors from the Pennsylvania Volleyball Coaches Association for 2024. The four players honored from the Lancaster-Lebanon League were Hempfield’s Addison Leber and Bryce Calabretta, and Manheim Township’s Gracie Reinhart on the Class 4A team, and Lancaster Catholic’s Molly Wentz on the Class 2A team. From the CCAC, Linville Hill’s Desiree Smucker, Lyndi Esh and Kaley Higgins joined Ephrata Mennonite’s Joelle Burkholder on the Class 1A team. Leber, a senior outside hitter, earned her third All-State selection for L-L champion Hempfield, which won a sixth consecutive District Three title before reaching the PIAA semifinals for the second year in a row. Calabretta, an outside hitter, was one of just two freshmen to be named All-State. Reinhart, a senior opposite, helped the Blue Streaks reach the L-L final, the District Three semifinals and the PIAA Tournament for the first time since 2000. Wentz, a senior outside hitter, helped the Crusaders reach the District Three playoffs for the third straight season. Smucker, a senior outside hitter, and Esh, a senior libero, helped Linville Hill win its first District Three playoff match and first District Three title before surging all the way to the PIAA final. Higgins, a junior outside hitter, was the primary offensive threat for the Warriors. Burkholder, a junior middle hitter, helped Ephrata Mennonite reach the District Three final — where it lost to Linville Hill — as well as the PIAA Tournament for the first time in program history.",
