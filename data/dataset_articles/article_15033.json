  "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. — The University of Arizona Innocence Project has announced a $1.5 million grant the organization hopes to use on DNA analysis to investigate potential wrongful convictions.\n>> Download the 12News app for the latest local breaking news straight to your phone.\nThe money from a Department of Justice grant is the largest grant ever received by the university's Innocence Project.\n\"This grant means we can push forward, looking deeply into cases where DNA has the potential to prove innocence and pursuing relief for those who have been wrongfully convicted,\" said Vanessa Buch, director of the U of A Innocence Project.\nThe organization hopes the funding will help them increase DNA testing as a step toward criminal justice reform in Arizona.\nArizona has only seen three documented DNA exonerations since 1989.\nThe grant funding comes as the project is taking in more cases than ever with hundreds of claims of innocence waiting to be reviewed, according to officials with the project.\n\"DNA testing is incredibly costly, and without these resources, a clinic like ours couldn't tackle cases that might require multiple rounds of testing or new, more advanced methods,\" said Virginia Morris, assistant director of the U of A Innocence Project. \"Even just accessing older case files can be time-consuming and expensive. This grant provides us with funding to obtain records, travel when needed, and consult additional experts to give each case the attention it deserves.\"\nThe funding will be used to bring more law students into the clinic and will help them get hands-on experience reviewing cases.\nStudents can draft legal documents, interview witnesses and meet with people who may have spent years or decades in prison. Those interactions can be transformative, both professionally and personally, Morris said.\nAs the grant expands the clinic's capacity to investigate cases, so too will it enable the U of A Innocence Project to build upon its partnership with the Conviction and Sentence Integrity Unit of the Pima County Attorney's Office.\n\"Our hope is that by focusing on DNA cases, we'll learn more about errors in the system and start to break down barriers to exoneration in Arizona,\" Buch said.",
