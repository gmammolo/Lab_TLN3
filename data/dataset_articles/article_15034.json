The board did not vote on the plan, but by signaling its preference among the three construction options, the architect can begin planning.\nThe choice: The option the board favors would fulfill educational needs and cause the least disruption to students and staff during construction, board members said.\nQuotable: “The $211 million … was $231 million at one point. I thought to myself, ‘I would love to do that. But I don’t see it happening,’” said Vice President Pat Wagner. “I can see it happening now (with the lower cost). We’re going to have to be vigilant in what we do, there’s no question. The days of 1.1% tax increases, those days are done.”\nWhat’s next: Michael Kelly of KCBA Architects said he will present refined drawings to the buildings and grounds committee and the public in February. If the board goes ahead with the project, the work could be put out for bidding as early as January 2026. In the meantime, the district is working with its financial adviser, Raymond James, to determine the best way to finance the project.\nTaxes: The board discussed the district’s ability to pay for a new contract with teachers, increase pay for administrators and support staff, and renovate the high school.\nQuotable: “Year one and two, I think we can afford this. Years three and four, I think we run out of taxing authority before we solve this problem,” said board member Grant Keener.\nMore: An average annual tax increase of a little more than 2% would be necessary just to pay for the four-year contract the board approved for teachers, Karen Hall, chief finance and operations officer, said.\nQuotable: “Quite frankly, if we don’t do it, if we delay this longer, it’s going to cost us a lot more,” board member Charles Merris said of the high school project.\nOther projects: Last month the board asked administration for more information about the cost of upgrades to Centerville Elementary School and the high school stadium so it could determine if the district could afford to undertake those projects at the same time it is doing the high school work.\nCenterville Elementary: More data is being collected, however, tentative projections show less residential development in the future, which translates to fewer students, said Superintendent Michael Bromirski. As a result, Bromirski recommended that, for now, the district maintains the building instead of doing an expensive renovation. Future options include renovating and expanding the school or closing it, Bromirski said.\nThe stadium: Nothing in the stadium is up to code, John Michel of Fidevia, the district’s construction consultant, said. Repairing the grandstands, fieldhouse, lighting, bathrooms and press boxes could cost as little as $5.7 million and as much as $12.7 million.\nResolution: The board unanimously approved a resolution agreeing to adopt a balanced budget for the 2025-26 school while not raising property taxes above the 4.8% limit the state set for Hempfield. The vote does not commit the board to raising taxes. Approval of a budget is still months away.\nReorganization: The board reappointed Michael Donato as president and Pat Wagner as vice president.\nNext meeting: The board will meet for its education and programming and policy, personnel and legal committee meeting at 5 p.m., Dec. 12.\nLocal News Hempfield school board passes teacher contract 156 days past the expiration of previous contract ASHLEY STALNECKER | Staff Writer Community News Hempfield standardized test scores exceed state averages; students show growth in math, English and science MARTIN PFLIEGER | FOR LNP | LANCASTERONLINE Community News Hempfield school board approves 4 new courses MARTIN PFLIEGER | FOR LNP | LANCASTERONLINE Newsletter Success!
