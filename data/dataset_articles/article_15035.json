(Ed Wittenberg, special to cleveland.com)\nBy Ed Wittenberg, special to cleveland.com ORANGE, Ohio -- Olivia Ullner, a senior at Orange High School and an Orange resident, has earned the prestigious Girl Scout Gold Award.\nOn Wednesday (Dec. 4), Village Council recognized Olivia’s achievement, with Mayor Judson Kline presenting her with a proclamation from his office.\n“This is an important step in leadership development for young people,” Kline said after reading the proclamation.\n“So congratulations, Olivia and mom, because I know it takes parents to get kids to do these things.”\nOlivia’s mother is Councilwoman Kim Ullner, who proudly introduced her daughter to council and explained the steps Olivia took to earn the Gold Award -- the highest achievement within the Girl Scouts of the USA.\nOnly 5.4 percent of eligible Girl Scouts earn the award, according to the Girl Scouts of the USA website.\nThe proclamation states that girls who pursue the Gold Award aspire to transform an idea and vision for change into an actionable plan with “measurable, sustainable and far-reaching results.”\nOlivia, who was born in Guatemala but raised in Orange, wanted to create a project that would help her birth country and also connect with her adopted one, Kim Ullner said.\n“Olivia found a local nonprofit, H(e)arts 4 Guatemala, based in Chagrin Falls, and through its director was able to identify a medical clinic in Izabal, Guatemala,” Ullner said.\nOlivia’s project consisted of setting up a new program collecting and delivering eyeglasses and hearing aids to this medical clinic, as well as earning funds to purchase medical equipment for the clinic.\nThe project is titled “Eyes and Ears for Guatemala.”\n“The medical clinic planned to expand to include eye care and had an identified need for eyeglasses, hearing aids and a piece of medical equipment,” Ullner said.\n“Olivia far exceeded her original goal of collecting 200 pairs of eyeglasses and hearing aids and collected 800 pairs of glasses and hearing aids, which were delivered.\n“This project keeps glasses and hearing aids out of our landfills, and they are cleaned and given new life to help children and adults in Guatemala who really need them.”\nOlivia, 17, recognizes that the best way out of poverty is education, Ullner said.\nShe noted that only 55 percent of Guatemalan children attend primary school, and even fewer complete primary school and go on to high school -- only seven out of every 100 children.\n“For children with vision and/or hearing impairments, those numbers are even lower,” Ullner said.\n“This project aims to help make glasses and hearing aids available to those most vulnerable and most in need.\n“Indeed, if children and adults in Guatemala can have their medical and educational needs met, they can become productive members of society and support themselves.”\nTo earn some money for her project, Olivia assembled a team and collected nearly 12,000 pounds of clothes and shoes, for which she was paid by the pound, Ullner said.\nShe also sold Girl Scout cookies and received a grant from the Kiwanis Club of Lander Circle, based in Pepper Pike.\n“All told, she earned $3,000, which she used to purchase a key piece of medical equipment -- an ophthalmoscope with 20 diopter lenses and long-range battery -- so the doctor can go into the field to treat and diagnose residents who cannot get to the clinic,” Ullner said.\n“With this piece of medical equipment, the clinic’s director hopes to diagnose and treat eye disease early to prevent patients from losing their vision.”\nThe money Olivia earned was also used to pay to ship collected glasses and hearing aids to Izabal, Ullner said.\nOlivia’s project is being continued by the student board of H(e)arts 4 Guatemala, Ullner said.\nThe board has begun to bring the project to area schools, such as Hathaway Brown and Kenston, as well as Chagrin Falls after the holidays, she said.\nCollection boxes for glasses and hearing aids are located at those schools, as well as at Orange High School, Moreland Hills Elementary School and Orange Village Hall.\nOlivia has been a Girl Scout since second grade.\nAccording to Ullner, she will be the first girl to graduate from Orange High School as a “Trifecta Girl Scout,” which means she has earned the Girl Scout Bronze, Silver and Gold awards.\nFor the Bronze Award, Olivia and several fellow troop members earned money to purchase a bullet- and stab-proof vest for the Orange Police Department’s K-9 officer, Deacon, who has since retired.\nFor the Silver Award, she worked with two other Girl Scouts to increase kindness in the community and created a “kindness rock garden,” Ullner said.\n“Olivia will be the only Orange High School senior to graduate this year having earned the Gold Award,” her mother said.\nOlivia plans to continue her study of American Sign Language in college, as she hopes to earn a degree in ASL English interpreting and become a community interpreter and teacher of the deaf, Ullner said.\n“Olivia exemplifies kindness, caring and dedication to community service,” she said.\n“She intends to continue her commitment of giving back to her community and making the world a better place.\n“I could not be prouder of Olivia. I know that she will continue to do great things.”\nOlivia said she was surprised but pleased to receive the proclamation.\nShe said she learned she would be receiving it about 15 minutes before the council meeting began.\nRECOMMENDED • cleveland.com\nBrowns at Broncos preview: Storylines, scouting report and our picks for Monday Night Football (Podcast) Nov. 30, 2024, 5:00 a.m.\n‘Snoop’s Fatherhood: Cori and Wayne’s Story:’ Watch free stream today Dec. 5, 2024, 7:03 p.m.\nRead more from the Chagrin Solon Sun .\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
