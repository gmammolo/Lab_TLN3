  "text": "Representatives from Candler and LaGrange College were on hand for a signing ceremony for a new agreement between the two schools. Photo: Adam Bowers.\nCandler School of Theology at Emory University and LaGrange College have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will offer LaGrange students the opportunity to earn both their bachelor’s degree and master of divinity degree in six years—one year less than if the degrees are pursued separately.\nCalled “the 3+3 Accelerated Ministry Track,” the program is designed to allow students to progress toward careers in ministry faster and with more manageable costs.\nIt is open to LaGrange College students who major or minor in religion and/or are actively involved in the college’s spiritual life activities. In the first three years of the program, students will complete 90 credits toward their undergraduate degree at LaGrange, including the core curriculum and requirements of their major. During the second three years, students are enrolled in the master of divinity (MDiv) program at Candler. After the fourth year, 30 credits will be transferred back to LaGrange and students will receive their bachelor’s degree. Years five and six are spent finishing the MDiv program at Candler.\nRepresentatives from both schools attended a Nov. 21 signing ceremony at Emory to formalize the agreement, with Candler Dean Jonathan Strom, LaGrange President Susanna Baxter, and Jessica Terrell of the North Georgia Conference of The United Methodist Church (UMC) delivering remarks.\nStrom noted that as United Methodist-related institutions, Candler and LaGrange share the “distinct Wesleyan ethos” of holding fast to their traditional strengths while also creating new innovations in ministry and education.\n“Methodists are exceptionally good at establishing ecumenical institutions that are collaborative without losing their own identity,” Strom said. “This ecumenical openness and willingness to engage the liberal arts and learning is one of the distinctive threads that pulls Candler and LaGrange together.”\nHe also pointed to other mutually beneficial LaGrange–Candler connections. “LaGrange College has had an enormous role in raising up elders in the North Georgia Conference over the years. And in turn, Emory is also happy to see how our graduates have played an important role in the development of LaGrange,” he said, citing Candler alums Stuart Gulley, president of LaGrange from 1996 to 2009, and the college’s chaplain, Ashley Jenkins, also a LaGrange alum.\nLaGrange President Susanna Baxter remarked on the positive impacts of the agreement on United Methodism.\n“It is an honor to partner with Candler School of Theology in this important pathway, not only for our students, but for the denomination,” she said. “The students who are the beneficiaries of this program will be tethered to the strong United Methodist heritage and ethos of both of our institutions. The future will be yours to reform and reshape as we educate you on that path.”\nJessica Terrell, district superintendent of the North West District of the North Georgia Conference of the UMC, represented the conference at the signing. Terrell earned her BA from LaGrange and her DMin from Candler.\n“Today a good thing is coming from the partnership of these two United Methodist schools,” Terrell said. “Each of you are committing yourselves again, as you have in years past, to preparing leaders for faithful ministry in the church and beyond. However, this time you are doing it in yet another new way. Through the 3+3 program, you are allowing students to better afford the education and experience they need, while at the same time allowing the church to deploy such gifted and excellent guides into a variety of church and community contexts at a faster pace.\n“May God richly bless this new program and partnership we celebrate today. And may God continue to increase within all of us a permanent passion for the power and necessity of a theological education.”\nStudents interested in the 3+3 Accelerated Ministry Track may contact Candler’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid at candleradmissions@emory.edu for more information.",
