  "text": "David W. Fardo, PhD, the Stephen W. Wyatt Endowed Professor of Public Health at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health (CPH), has been named a Fellow of the American Statistical Association (ASA). This prestigious honor recognizes his exceptional contributions to the field of statistical science and his dedication to advancing the discipline.\nFellowship in the ASA is one of the highest honors in the field of statistics. Each year, no more than one-third of 1% of ASA members are selected. Established nearly 100 years ago, the honor highlights contributions such as published works, leadership positions, professional activities, and impact on statistical science.\n\"It’s surreal and not something I imagined as possible, frankly,” said Dr. Fardo, reflecting on his election as a Fellow “But it feels great, and it’s truly a testament to the teams I’ve been blessed to work with over the years here. Across the board, I’ve been blessed with fantastic students, staff, and faculty mentors and collaborators here at UK and across the world.\"\nIn addition to his role as a professor at CPH, Dr. Fardo is an affiliate faculty member at the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging and a co-investigator at the UK Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA).\nDr. Fardo currently leads two NIA-funded research projects as principal investigator focusing on genetic risk factors associated with various neuropathological traits and neurodegenerative diseases. His work has resulted in more than 120 peer-reviewed publications, contributing significantly to advancements in his field.\nDr. Fardo has developed and taught a wide range of courses in CPH across degree programs, including graduate-level classes in statistical genetics. He has also served in key leadership roles, such as Academic Leadership Academy Fellow, Chair of the Faculty Council, and Chair of the Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure Committee.\n\"I joined ASA as a student when in UK’s Statistics PhD program many years ago. I got fairly active, then maintained that connection at Harvard and then back here at UK when I joined the faculty in 2008,\" he said.\nDr. Fardo expects that this milestone will open doors for new projects, collaborations, and funding opportunities that will continue to advance statistical science and support the department’s work.\n“It’s nice to be recognized, and the honor will help lend additional credibility to our department and future work, such as grant proposals,\" he said.\nTo learn more about ASA Fellows, visit the ASA site.\nTo learn more about the University of Kentucky College of Public Health, visit cph.uky.edu.\nCollege of Public Health 111 Washington Avenue Lexington, KY 40536 ukcph@uky.edu",
