  "text": "Cultural exchange program seeks host families for international students\nMINOT, N.D. (KMOT) - The ‘American Dream’ is a common phrase about the idea that anyone can attain their own version of success.\nNationwide programs like the\n[International Cultural Exchange Services](https://www.icesusa.org/), or ICES, help students all over the world experience their version of that dream in the United States.\nA local coordinator based in Sawyer, Jennifer Peart, has helped international students find a host family in the area.\nThe process starts off with an American family taking an interest in being a host for a student from anywhere in the world, and Peart connects the student’s interest to the family.\nWhile there isn’t any financial compensation for hosting, Peart said it is the rewarding feeling of exposing your family to different cultures around the world.\nShe said growing up, her family was often a host, which she said were some of the best years of her childhood.\n“They get to experience what they think is the ‘American dream,’ which is absolutely incredible that they view that in a way. So, it’s very rewarding for me to watch them come to this country and slowly learn our customs, and slowly learn our language a lot more than they already have,” said Peart.\nStudents pay for their costs and they also come with their own insurance.\nHosting usually starts in January or August for a semester or a school year.\nThe program has been bringing in students from Russia, Slovakia, many Asian countries and more to the Minot area for the last three decades.\nIt is free to be a host family, and those interested in becoming one can contact Peart through\nCopyright 2024 KFYR.
