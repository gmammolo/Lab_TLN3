  "text": "Hopkins Co. teacher honored by SBO+ Magazine\nEVANSVILLE, Ind. (WFIE) - Hopkins County Schools teacher David Moss has been selected to represent Kentucky in the SBO+ magazine issue featuring 50 Music Teachers Who Make a Difference.\nAccording to a press release, Moss teaches at both West Hopkins School and Hopkins County Central High School.\nHe is the band director at WHS and an assistant at HCCHS.\nThis award highlights music educators who go above and beyond to make a difference in the lives of students and their communities through music.\nMoss says he doesn’t know who nominated him but wants to thank the person who did.\nHe previously received this award once before in 2006. This is the 25th year SBO+ has released this special edition.\n“I am grateful to be recognized by SBO Magazine, but the real difference makers are the students, parents, and colleagues that I get to work with on a daily basis that make my job the best in HCS,” Moss said. “I wake up every day grateful I am given the opportunity to make a difference in our part of Hopkins County.”\nThe December issue was released this week.\nCopyright 2024 WFIE.
