  "text": "Posted 2:06 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024\nSenior Anika Oplanic honored with Outstanding Women of Color in Education Award\nStudent leaders are the heartbeat of UW-La Crosse — helping the university create and update spaces that allow students to thrive.\nUWL senior Anika Oplanic is being recognized for her extensive contributions as a student leader as UWL’s honoree for the\n[Universities of Wisconsin Outstanding Women of Color in Education Award.](https://www.wisconsin.edu/grants-awards/women-of-color/)\nAs a molecular biology and cell biology major with a passion for social justice, Oplanic’s nomination is a testament to her work surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion (\n[DEI](/diversity-inclusion/)) on campus.\n“Being the first student in 11 years to win this award is an insane feat, and I am incredibly honored to be recognized for my work with (the UWL student organization)\n[ALANA](/multicultural-student-services/get-involved/multicultural-student-organizations/) during these past two years,” Oplanic says. “But the real reward is the students I’ve been able to connect with and help every day.”\nOplanic’s leadership journey began with Asian, Latin, African, and Native American (ALANA) Women, where she stepped into a leadership role during a challenging time. Membership had dwindled, but through her efforts and collaboration with co-leaders, ALANA grew by 1,350%, tripling attendance at its signature Phenomenal Women’s Dinner and reestablishing its mission as a space of sisterhood and empowerment for women of color.\n“ALANA was a safe haven for me,” Oplanic says. “By 2023, we rebuilt a sense of community for women of color on campus.”\nHer impact extends beyond ALANA. As the first student leadership development intern for the\n[ Office of Multicultural Student Services (OMSS)](/multicultural-student-services/), she fosters connections among Multicultural Student Organization (MSO) leaders and mentors emerging student leaders.\n“Our OMSS family has a strong community of students within it,” Oplanic explains. “It’s an unofficial tradition every year — the older leaders mentor the younger leaders, and the cycle goes on. There is a long history of executive and student leaders making a difference on this campus, and to be able to carry that responsibility helped me to build my own identity on campus. While this award publicizes my work, I think that the true reward is the connections I’ve made with my peers along the way.”\nAn advocate for education, Oplanic emphasizes the importance of integrating the stories of underrepresented groups into mainstream narratives. At ALANA meetings, she launched the “Woman of the Week” series, spotlighting the lives and accomplishments of extraordinary women of color.\n“To build an inclusive environment, education is key,” Oplanic says. “It’s up to those outside underrepresented groups to do the work — read, watch, learn and share. Change begins with education, and the work never ends.”\nAs she prepares to graduate this spring, Oplanic is committed to continuing her work through OMSS, ensuring future students find the community and opportunities they deserve.\n“I really do feel that it's my calling to help students find themselves on this campus,” Oplanic says. “I want to be there to help them find those opportunities. The work calls — it never ends.”",
