  "text": "The Indigenous Black Engineering Technology PhD Project (IBET) held its third national annual conference from November 21 to 23, 2024 at York University in conjunction with Engineering Deans Canada.\nIBET is a partnership of 18 faculties of engineering across Canada dedicated to reducing the systemic barriers faced by Indigenous and Black students pursuing doctoral degrees in engineering and STEM subjects. To support these students, IBET provides four-year fellowships valued at $30,000 a year. They also address two other barriers to representation by providing a networking platform and a mentorship program.\n\"This year’s conference reiterated the importance of community within this project,” IBET said in their conference material. “Our fellow numbers have increased from 17 to 55 in three years, and that growth has created a new ecosystem where the fellows learn from, motivate, and support one another. We hope to have full participation from all fellows for upcoming conferences having heard the success stories and witnessing the jovial and enriching atmosphere when the fellows come together.”\nJeanette Southwood, Engineers Canada’s Vice President, Corporate Affairs and Strategic Partnerships, presented on the first day of the conference about Engineers Canada and its role as the national voice of the engineering regulators in Canada as well as its Belonging and Engagement work. Southwood is also an IBET mentor.\n“Engineers Canada’s core purposes include promoting diversity and inclusivity in the engineering profession that reflects Canadian society,” explains Southwood. “I was proud to participate in the conference on behalf of Engineers Canada and to see the growth and impact the IBET program has had on its fellows.”\n“It is great having the dedicated time and place to connect with the other fellows, to share our research as well as our experiences more generally,” said Naomi Paul, a Systems Design Engineering student from the University of Waterloo, and an IBET fellow. “Over just the two to three days of seeing everyone I came home with a long list of scholars who I could look into as well as suggestions for how to prepare for and complete my comprehensive exams from fellows who are farther along in their studies.”\n“And the poster session with the deans I found to be one of the most helpful parts of the gathering. It was a chance to share our work more broadly and show how much the IBET program has helped us. I chatted with many of the deans as well as people from NSERC and Engineers Canada who asked many great questions and showed interest in seeing how my work progresses over the next few years.”\nIBET has worked hard this year on expanding its program offerings and providing post-doctoral support for those who will be seeking opportunities after successfully defending their thesis, as well as engaging past fellows to return as mentors to the program. This year, the IBET PhD Project was fortunate to have the support of sponsors, The McCall MacBain Foundation and Geosyntec Consultants, for the conference.
