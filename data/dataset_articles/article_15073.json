  "text": "MILWAUKEE — Marquette University School of Dentistry celebrated a major milestone in its facility revitalization campaign Tuesday with the grand opening of the Delta Dental Urgent and Special Care Clinic.\nA ceremony held Tuesday commemorated the multi-year effort to renovate the school’s educational clinics and upgrade technology and equipment throughout the 120,000-square-foot -building. The completed renovations better serve patients and create an enhanced clinical education environment to support Wisconsin’s future oral health care workforce.\n“It has been exciting to see the revitalization of these clinics, from conception to construction to completion,” President Kimo Ah Yun said. “Our students are learning in state-of-the-art facilities with enhanced equipment and technology that will prepare them to successfully and seamlessly begin their careers upon graduation. These new spaces also allow us to continue our long-standing commitment to providing high-quality oral care for our community, especially members of underserved populations.”\nThe roughly 2,900-square-foot Delta Dental Urgent and Special Care Clinic — formerly the Advanced Care Clinic — which serves emergency and special needs patients, underwent one of the most significant transformations in the revitalization. The special care wing includes a private operating room equipped with a wheelchair lift and bariatric chair for people with disabilities, a private sensory adapted room and two new dental chairs. On the other side of the clinic, a lab and a radiology room and four new chairs — including one specifically for endodontic care — serve those needing urgent care.\nAs a part of the successful university-wide Time to Rise campaign, the School of Dentistry launched capital fundraising efforts to upgrade the original clinics within the school’s existing infrastructure. Beginning in 2022, in an effort led by Marquette Trustee Emeritus John Bergstrom and alumna Sue Meinerz, D.D.S., the school raised approximately $7.5 million to rebuild the facility and clinics, with generous support from Delta Dental of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Dental Association, and gifts from alumni donors and friends of the School of Dentistry. That same year, the school was awarded a $1.02 million grant from the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to update clinic equipment and increase capacity for the care of patients with special needs. In addition, the State of Wisconsin generously contributed $10.75 million for the overall campaign in August. 2023.\n“Marquette lives its mission, and I am proud that you can see it in action everyday within the walls of the School of Dentistry,” said Dr. Elsbeth Kalenderian, dean of the dental school. “We are incredibly grateful for Delta Dental of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Dental Association, government leaders and the countless donors who demonstrated their belief in our School of Dentistry students, faculty and staff through their support of this project. Collectively, all our partners understand that by working together, we serve the citizens of Wisconsin with integrity, passion and excellence, particularly our underserved and special needs patients, which embodies our mission.”\nThe school’s revitalization project has taken place in three phases since 2022: Phase one included renovating two pre-doctoral clinics and marked the beginning of construction on the Dr. Patrick Pralle Innovation Center; phase two included renovating the two remaining pre-doctoral clinics; phase three will finish with upgrading the school’s seven specialty clinics, six classrooms and patient areas.\nAs the state’s only dental school, Marquette delivers patient care and services to citizens from 66 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties. Since its state-of-the-art building opened in 2002, the School of Dentistry has received nearly 2 million patient visits, with an estimated value of services provided annually exceeding $16 million. By offering the most advanced clinical resources and instructional technology available, the next Marquette dental students are positioned to grow and adapt with the rapidly changing health care landscape.\nAbout Marquette University School of Dentistry\nFounded in 1894, Marquette University School of Dentistry has been a significant provider of oral health care to patients and excellent clinically based dental education to dental students and recently celebrated 130 years of providing dental education and community service. Programs are guided by dedicated faculty and practicing professionals who uphold Marquette’s vision to train highly skilled oral health care practitioners to bring top-quality dental care to urban and rural communities across the country and around the world.",
