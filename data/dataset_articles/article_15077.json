We expect nothing else,\" he said. \"In honor of the Top 25 College Basketball Poll, we take a moment to pause and look at the Top 25 elementary schools (Grades K to 5) in the State of Connecticut.\"\nThe ranking tell similar tales, he said.\nFind out what's happening in Vernonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\n\"We also expect our schools to do their best for our children,\" Macary said.\nThe \"best indicator\" to evaluate schools is the Next Generation Accountability Index, Macary said. Connecticut's Next Generation Accountability System is a broad set of 12 indicators that \"help tell the story of how well a school is preparing its students for success in college, careers and life,\" he said.\nFind out what's happening in Vernonwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\n\"The system moves beyond test scores and graduation rates and instead provides a more holistic, multi-factor perspective of district and school performance and incorporates student growth over time,\" Macary said.\nWhat are the 12 indicators?\n- Academic achievement status measured by state assessments\n- Academic growth\n- Assessment participation rate\n- Chronic absenteeism\n- Postsecondary preparation – coursework\n- Postsecondary readiness – exams and college credit\n- Graduation – on track in ninth grade\n- Graduation – four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – all students\n- Graduation – six-year adjusted cohort graduation rate – high needs\n- Postsecondary entrance rate – all students (college enrollment)\n- Physical fitness\n- Arts access\nMacary pointed out that Vernon's Skinner Road School (Grades Pre-K through Grade 5 ) cracked the state's Top 25 Elementary Schools ranking this year with a score of 86.0.\nHere are the rankings with Skinner at No. 21:\nIn September 2023, U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona recognized Skinner Road School as one of the National Blue-Ribbon Schools for 2023. The recognition, Macary said, was based on a school's overall academic performance and progress in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.\n\"The coveted National Blue Ribbon Schools award is given to only 353 schools in the nation and only 43 (of the 353) received the award for closing the achievement gap,\" he said. \"Skinner Road School's accountability index (or score) was better in the 2023-2024 year than the 2022-2023 year when it received the National Blue-Ribbon award. This affirms the hard work of our educators, families, and communities in creating a safe and welcoming school where students master challenging and engaging content.\"\nMacary referred to the table \"to see whom Skinner Road is competing with in the State of Connecticut.\"\nMacary added, \"Go Huskies and Go Unicorns (SRS).\"\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.\n[Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.](/connecticut/vernon/subscribe)",
