  "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — This past summer, the Penn State Eberly College of Science’s Office of Science Outreach celebrated its 25th year of Science-U camps. Founded by Jackie Bortiatynski, director of the college’s Cada R. and Susan Wynn Grove Center for Excellence in Science Education, and her colleagues in 1990, the camps were created to give K-12 students authentic science opportunities by allowing them to interact with Penn State research and scientists, and they have served roughly 440 students every summer since.\n“Each of our Science-U camps is designed to take campers through a one-week journey that investigates an area of STEM in a fascinating and meaningful way,” said Caitlin Teti, director of the Office of Science Outreach. “Guided by our passionate staff, Science-U campers are encouraged to ask questions, think critically, and explore how science can captivate them and make a difference in their lives.”\nThroughout its 25 years, Science-U has been through many changes, but its mission has remained steadfast. The goal, Teti emphasized, is not for each child to emerge as a scientist, but rather to have gained important knowledge and a curiosity about the world around them.\nUnique to Science-U, the summer camps integrate collegiate research with elementary and high school students, allowing them to interact directly with the subject matter and faculty involved.\nAnother outstanding feature of Science-U is the interaction between campers and Penn State student staff. Campers can follow the lead of these mentors, learning about their chosen fields and career paths. The camps provide learning opportunities not only for the campers but also for the staff, who gain skills in science fields and early childhood education, as well as the chance to become leaders for the campers. Over the years, some have even made the leap from camper to staff member.\nPenn State undergraduates Layla Thornton and Sigurdur “Diddi” Steinsson were once enrolled in Science-U as campers, and since becoming Penn State students, they have decided to keep Science-U in their lives by giving back to the camps that helped shaped them and their interests.\n“My main motivation to get involved as a college student was to learn about fun science topics and to encourage campers to find what they are passionate about, as well as share my own passion for science!” said Steinsson, a second-year physics and math major.\nTwenty-five years running, Science-U continues to evolve: New camps will be featured in summer 2025, including the return of the popular \"CSI: Forensic Files” crime scene investigation camp, and a genetics-focused camp titled “Finding your Roots.” The future of Science-U, according to Teti, will consist of more partnerships, increased funding, more new camps, and additional scholarship opportunities for historically underrepresented students.\n“It’s so important to engage children at a young age, to spark their curiosity and instill in them a lifelong love of science and learning,” Bortiatynski said. “When we started the Science-U camps almost 30 years ago, we could not have imagined how popular they would become, or have foreseen the tremendous impact they would have on generations of future scientists. Looking ahead, I know we are all excited to see what amazing developments the next 25 years will bring!”\nScience-U would not be possible without support from donors, grant-making agencies, and the Eberly College of Science community; their contributions, Teti noted, are critical to Science-U's continued ability to provide K-12 students with opportunities to explore science.\n“We sincerely hope every camper comes out of their Science-U experience inspired to stay curious and keep learning!” she said.",
