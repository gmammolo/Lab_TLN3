  "text": "Self-taught historian, cultural worker and creator of the new YouTube program \"You Don't Know Chi!\" Shermann Thomas, also known as \"Dilla,\" will be the keynote speaker for Northwestern University's 2025 MLK Commemoration.\nThe keynote event will take place at 5 p.m., Tuesday, Jan. 21 in Galvin Hall, 70 Arts Circle Drive. The event is free and open to the public. Seating will be first come first served; reservations are not required. The event also will be available by livestream.\nFor the livestream link and more information on MLK Commemoration programs, visit Northwestern's [MLK website](http://www.northwestern.edu/mlk).\nAbout Shermann 'Dilla' Thomas\nA proud lifelong resident of Chicago's South Side, Thomas founded [Chicago Mahogany Tours](https://www.chicagomahogany.com/our-historian) to provide tours that allow him to share Chicago's neighborhood history, architecture and culture with visitors. He also offers history lessons and lectures to students, Fortune 500 companies and partners with Chicago's professional sports teams.\nThomas lives by the motto: \"Everything dope about America comes from Chicago.\"\nHis passion for storytelling has led to the creation of more than 400 videos highlighting stories of Chicago under his social media accounts [@6figga_dilla](https://www.youtube.com/@6figga_dilla), presenting his captivating style of storytelling from an insider's perspective. Thomas aims to chronicle the history of all 77 Chicago neighborhoods.\nFor instance, in his Chatham neighborhood video, Thomas highlights the origins of one of the most historic and beautiful neighborhoods on the South Side. Italian stone masons hired to build homes in Avalon Park were among the first residents of Chatham, which was originally called \"Hog Swamp.\" Development came quickly to the renamed Chatham neighborhood once a railroad stop, watch factory and the nearby Pullman train factory were built and created more demand for housing. Many homes were designed by Chicago architect Herbert Grugel.\n\"Side note: Herbert Grugel was a wild boy, but it's Chicago so what do you expect?\" said Thomas, while holding an archived news clipping about Grugel's arraignment for impersonating a federal officer.\nThomas explains that in Chatham, like many other neighborhoods in Chicago, racial restrictive covenants barred African Americans from moving in. But by the 1970s, the community was solidly African American and unlike many South Side communities, solidly middle class. Gospel singer Mahalia Jackson, Chance the Rapper and the Chicago Cubs' Ernie Banks are among the American icons who have resided in Chatham.\nThomas also has completed videos on Bronzeville and Rogers Park, among other neighborhoods, along with videos on the history of Chicago's Italian Beef and the city's iconic Jewel-Osco grocery store.\nIn recognition for his work promoting Chicago globally, Thomas has received numerous honors, including being named Tourism Ambassador of the Year by Choose Chicago. He was also awarded the 2022 Studs Terkel Uplifting Voices Award by Public Narrative and the prestigious 21st Century Award by The Chicago Public Library.\nNationally, Thomas has appeared on \"The Today Show\" and \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" and his work has been featured in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and other international publications.\n\"We're thrilled that Dilla is coming back to Northwestern for this year's MLK Commemoration keynote address after a prior speaking engagement at Kellogg School of Management,\" said Leona Quist, MLK Commemoration project leader and executive assistant for the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion.\n\"In the spirit of Dr. King's legacy, Dilla has found incredible ways to shine a light on Chicago, whether that's highlighting 'dope' history or spotlighting ongoing issues like fair housing. Dilla's got his finger on the pulse of the city that's drawn so many folks to Northwestern,\" Quist said.\n[here](/historian-dilla-thomas-to-lead-northwestern-mlk-1372393/).",
