  "text": "The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Thursday, December 5, 2024, that the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price are now available in American Sign Language (ASL) videos in the Gospel Library.\nThese two books of scripture, and the existing ASL version of the Book of Mormon, continue to fulfill the revelation given to Joseph Smith that “every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language” (Doctrine and Covenants 90:11).\n“We encourage members to use the scriptures in regular personal and family study and in Church meetings and assignments,” wrote the First Presidency in a December 5 letter to Church leaders. “As members prayerfully learn and teach from the scriptures, their testimonies will grow, and they will receive greater direction in their daily lives.”\nLatter-day Saints will study the Doctrine and Covenants at home and church during 2025 as part of the Church’s annual curriculum for individuals and families.\nThe Book of Mormon Videos were also recently made available in ASL and descriptive audio. Additional ASL resources available to members include study helps, Scripture Stories and Bible Videos, which can be found in the https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study?lang=ase and on YouTube.\nThe Church’s Bible Videos became available in ASL in June 2023, along with audio description versions of Bible Videos in Media Library and Gospel Library.\nFind additional resources at",
