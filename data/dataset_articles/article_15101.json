  "text": "ANN ARBOR, MI - University of Michigan’s largest free tuition program is getting a hefty expansion as part of the university’s shifting diversity efforts.\nThe Go Blue Guarantee previously covered tuition for in-state families making less than $75,000 in income a year. The Board of Regents announced the expanded threshold of $125,000 during the Dec. 5 meeting.\nThe expansion means more than 2,000 additional in-state and current undergraduate students can qualify for free tuition on the Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint campuses, university officials said Thursday.\nIn addition to annual income, eligible families with assets up to $125,000 also qualify starting in the fall 2025 semester. Since the Go Blue Guarantee was established in 2018, more than 10,000 students will have received it by next fall, officials said.\n“The Go Blue Guarantee breaks down economic barriers and ensures that a world-class education is available to Michigan students from all backgrounds, no matter their family’s economic means,” President Santa Ono said in a statement.\n“It’s an extraordinary commitment to the state and to the future of this state,” Regent Mark Bernstein said.\nThe regents doubled the annual income threshold for the Go Blue Guarantee to better reflect the state of Michigan’s median income, Regent Mike Behm said. The program initially was marked for $65,000 annually and assets up to $50,000.\nThe regents increased the number to $75,000 in 2021, with Dearborn and Flint students needing to have a 3.5 GPA to qualify.\nRegent Denise Ilitch said the expansion is an example of the board “walking the walk.”\n“We are constantly thinking and talking about an affordable, accessible education for all,” she said.\nThe expansion will cost an additional $8.8 million, officials said.\n“As a state university, we have a responsibility to serve the people of Michigan and — given the many pressures of today’s economy — we want to ensure that working-class and middle-class Michiganders can send their children to this great university and benefit from all that it offers,” said Board Chair Katherine White.\nRegent Sarah Hubbard said the expansion is part of a university-wide effort to shift how it handles diversity, equity and inclusion. Between declaring institutional neutrality, eliminating diversity statements on job applications and the Go Blue Guarantee’s expansion, she said “were open for business for people from all walks of life.”\n“People should feel comfortable on this campus expressing diversity of thought and freedom of expression,” she said.\nThese diversity changes are coming at a time where faculty have organized multiple protests this week regarding concerns of cuts to DEI programs. About 100 protesters walked from Ono’s campus home on South University Avenue to the Ruthven Administrative Building prior to the meeting demanding the regents to maintain DEI funding.\nRead more: Feared DEI cuts prompt faculty pushback at University of Michigan\nProtesters chanted about how the upcoming Trump administration could be affecting the university’s DEI changes. Chris Kolb, vice president for government affairs at the university, confirmed that this is a possibility in comments he made to the board.\n“I have been told pretty bluntly that Congress that this administration will use whatever tools they can to have us yield to what they want us to do,” Kolb said.\nPotential areas to increase funding at the university are through the Department of Energy and Department of Defense, Kolb said. However, the university will have to prepare for federal action on DEI issues.\n“DEI is one of the things that they believe needs to be eliminated from higher education,” he added. “They will use whatever tools they can, including the cutting off of finances, to make that happen, and we need to be aware of that as an institution.”\nIf you would like more reporting like this delivered free to your inbox, click here and signup for our weekly newsletter: Michigan Schools.\nWant more Ann Arbor-area news?
