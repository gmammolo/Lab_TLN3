  "text": "Research Infosource ranks McGill second in Canada for medical research Amount of sponsored research funding is a key consideration in determining rankings By Meaghan Thurston\nDirector, Research Communications December 5, 2024\nMcGill is Canada’s No. 2 Research University of the Year in the medical category, according to Research Infosource Inc. The organization ranked McGill fourth overall among research universities in Canada.\nResearch Infosource’s rankings are heavily based on universities’ total sponsored research income: money that is invested in research by a funding agency, foundation or corporate partner. In 2023, McGill secured $685 million in research funding from public and private sources, an increase of 13.1 per cent over 2019.\nResearch Infosource also considers other key measures of research success, including research intensity, which results from dividing research funding by the number of full-time faculty members. McGill’s research intensity is $380,000, an increase of 12. 8 per cent from 2019.\n“McGill’s success in the Research Infosource 2024 ranking reflects the ambitious and forward-thinking efforts of its researchers across disciplines, and the sustained excellence of its medical school,” said Dominique Bérubé, Vice-President (Research and Innovation). “McGill is also committed to fostering a research and innovation ecosystem that is among the best in the world, by forging strong connections to industry partners, and building local and global research networks.”\nResearch Infosouce announced the results in its publication Canada’s Innovation Leaders 2024 (CIL2024).\nCIL2024 also published a list of Canada’s Top 40 Research Hospitals , ranking the McGill University Health Centre third.",
