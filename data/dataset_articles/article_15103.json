  "text": "MANILA, PHILIPPINES – The Google News Initiative (GNI), in partnership with digital consultancy Bastion Digital , is welcoming applications from Philippine-based newsrooms for the GNI AI Workshops program. This 16-week program is designed to empower Philippine newsrooms and journalists to harness the potential of generative AI. Apply via this website .\nThe GNI AI Workshops program, which will run from February to June 2025, will provide selected news organizations with the tools, training, and 1:1 support needed to experiment with and implement innovative AI-driven solutions. AI experts and industry mentors will guide participants in using current generative AI tools to launch a pilot and report on the results.\nThis initiative is the latest in Google’s commitment to improving local industries through the adoption of AI technology. In the field of journalism, generative AI has quickly been embraced — as of 2023, 32 percent of newsrooms were already using generative AI tools in the creation of news content, according to a survey conducted by Statista . With that number likely increasing and technology rapidly evolving today, AI skills stand to be among the most important to have among journalists.\nThe program teaches a structured approach to AI experimentation, ensuring responsible and ethical use of technology. Included are expert-led sessions on Google’s generative AI tools, including Gemini, Pinpoint, and AI Studio. Both industry experts and Bastion Digital ’s team will guide participants and assist them in using these tools to conduct experiment design and execution.\nNews organizations interested in participating must be based in and serve audiences in the Philippines, with a core team of a minimum of two employees. Their representatives must be able to commit two to three people for the 16-week program.\n“Google is deeply invested in the Philippines’ digital future and the responsible adoption of generative AI. The Google News Initiative is committed to enhancing journalism’s crucial role in an informed and progressive society, particularly as the 2025 midterm elections draw near. We’re proud and excited to offer Filipino journalists AI training designed to improve accuracy, efficiency, and innovation in their reporting,” said Jackie Wang , Google Country Director for Thailand and the Philippines .\n“As part of our ongoing collaboration with the Google News Initiative, Bastion Digital is committed to helping organizations navigate the evolving world of AI. This program, led by principal AI consultant Shaun Davies, encourages a ‘test and learn’ approach, empowering organizations to embrace innovation at their own pace. As we grow our presence in the APAC region, we remain focused on guiding organizations across various sectors in exploring AI’s potential,” said Jenni Ryall, Director for Bastion Digital.\nThe GNI AI Workshops program is also officially endorsed by the Commission on Elections, which looks forward to the use of AI in contributing to truthful and accurate reporting in the upcoming 2025 Philippine midterm elections.\n“Google has been a valuable technological partner of the Commission on Elections throughout several electoral cycles, and we laud the Google News Initiative for piloting this innovative AI program for members of the media. Upskilling a key electoral stakeholder will no doubt contribute toward ensuring a free, orderly, honest, and credible electoral exercise,” said Atty. John Rex C. Laudiangco, Director – Education and Information Department at COMELEC .\nThe deadline for applications is on January 20, 2025. A selection process will determine the final five participants, which will be announced by the end of January 2025. Interested newsrooms can apply for the GNI AI Workshops program via this website .",
