  "text": "The OC STEM Initiative, a longtime partner of OCDE, recently recognized 12 educators through its Cox Communications-sponsored Outstanding STEM Educators program for their exceptional work in providing inquiry-based STEM learning opportunities.\nA ceremony was held on Dec. 3 at The Cove at The University of California, Irvine, where Colleen Dillaway, Orange County market vice president for Cox, presented the awards.\nThe OC STEM Initiative seeks to find and honor educators who uniquely impact students with their ability to engage and motivate. These educators have been identified as key contributors to inspiring the next generation of the STEM workforce.\nEach honoree received $500 while each of their organizations were awarded $1,500 plus an additional $1,000 from Cox to explore new STEM educational opportunities.\nHere are the 2024 Outstanding STEM Educators of the year.\nMan Luong\nRacine Cross\nKristin Raub\nSean P.

To date, the institute has served 24 of the county’s 28 school districts.\nAnother collaborative effort between OCDE and the OC STEM Initiative produced the Lead STEM Practitioners program, which forms groups of teacher leaders from 10 different school districts to assess their schools and strengthen STEM learning opportunities for all students.\nStarting next year, OCDE will assume leadership of the OC STEM Initiative. This transition will look to build upon the momentum and success of the existing program, underscoring OCDE’s commitment to fostering STEM education.",
