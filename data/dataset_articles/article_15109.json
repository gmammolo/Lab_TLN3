  "text": "WOONSOCKET, R.I. (WJAR) — Chartwells School Dining Services, which, as of this school year services 26 of our 36 Rhode Island school districts, continues the march to expand its variety of healthy, local foods.\nWoonsocket is one of the three new school districts on board.\n\"It really helps because the farms, there's a lot of farms in Rhode Island, and some of them are really small so for us to be able to help their business by putting their food on the school lunch trays, it's really good for them,\" said Solange Morrissette, District Manager of Chartwells.\nSome of those foods include vegetables, carrots and peppers from local farms turkey from Baffoni's Poultry Farm.\n\"We are offering pizza made from scratch, pizza dough, so we bought a pizza sheeter,\" said Morrissette.\nOne of those pizzas featured butternut squash, caramelized onions and blue cheese.\n\"And it was like butter squash and it was kind of like I don't know but it's not bad,\" said Melissa Nakawombe, a student at the high school.\nHEALTH CHECK: Experts stress proper eczema diagnosis, treatment to prevent other conditions When I pointed out she had two bites, she had this to say.\n\"I did! It's good, I'm not going to lie,\" said Nakawombe.\nAlso featured on the menu, made-from-scratch pasta with local vegetables mixed in.\nIt's all about trying new foods and combinations and bringing in new equipment to make it tastier.\n\"We are putting rotisseries in school districts all across the state. We're putting pasta extruders, to really increase the culinary aspect of school lunch in Rhode Island. The scratch cooking, the local, that's our goal every single day,\" said Morrissette.\nThe hope is that the students try new foods in school and if they like them, spread the word at home.",
