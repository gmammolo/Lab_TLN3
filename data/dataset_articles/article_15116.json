  "text": "Free food available to students during exam period\nAccess to healthy meals during a busy and stressful period is important so that students can fuel their minds and thrive during exam season. That’s why TMU is offering free food at the Hub Cafe from now through December 13 (excluding weekends).\n“Eating a well-balanced diet has direct links to mental health and well-being. As many students continue to feel the effects of high food prices, we want to do everything possible to remove those barriers and to set them up for success during their exams, including providing access to meals that will help them think clearly and feel more alert,” said Jen McMillen, vice-provost, students.\nWith generous sponsorship from the most senior offices at the university, student unions and student societies, the Office of the Vice-Provost, Students, and TMU Eats are reintroducing the [Free Food Project](https://www.torontomu.ca/content/ryerson/tmueats/food-security/free-food-project/), which will make hot meals available to TMU students between December 4 and 13 for free while supplies last.\nStudents can bring their OneCard to the Hub Café (on the first floor of Jorgenson Hall) between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., and will have the option to choose from a meat entrée (halal) with two sides, or a plant-based entrée with two sides, one beverage, and one snack. Packaged Kosher and made-without-gluten options will be available by request in limited quantities. If a student does not have access to their OneCard, they can log into D2L/my.torontomu.ca as an alternative.\n“This initiative is only possible because of the many TMU community members who feel passionately about showing up for students every day. I thank everyone who contributed so generously and look forward to exploring how we can make this a recurring offering,” said McMillen.\nThe collective financial support of the following student unions, student societies and administrative offices has been essential in bringing the Free Food Project to life:\nStudent Unions\n- Toronto Metropolitan Association of Part-time Students (TMAPS)\n- Toronto Metropolitan Graduate Students' Union (TMGSU)\n- Toronto Metropolitan Students' Union (TMSU)\nStudent Societies\n- Faculty of Community Services Society (FCSS)\n- Metropolitan Undergraduate Engineering Society (MUES)\n- Society of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (SASSH)\n- Society of The Creative School (SCS)\n- Ted Rogers Students' Society (TRSS)\n- Undergraduate Science Society of Toronto Metropolitan (USSTM)\nAdministrative Offices\n- Office of the President\n- Office of the Provost and Vice-President, Academic\n- Office of the Vice-President, Administration and Operations (OVPAO)\n- Office of the Vice-Provost, Students (OVPS)\n“As the university’s food services provider, TMU Eats makes it a priority to find ways to collaborate with partners on campus to help address food insecurity, and to ensure students have access to free or affordable food on campus. Initiatives like this are an important way we can address food insecurity at TMU and support student success during a stressful time in the academic year,” shared Voula Cocolakis, assistant vice-president, university business services.\nIn addition to the Free Food Project happening during exams, [the Friendly Fiver daily special has been a staple](https://www.torontomu.ca/content/ryerson/tmueats/food-security/friendly-fiver/) at the Hub Café for more than 10 years. [Free Soup Day is also popular](https://www.torontomu.ca/content/ryerson/tmueats/food-security/free-soup-day/) among students throughout the school year, and the [Free Food Locator](https://www.torontomu.ca/content/ryerson/student-life-and-learning/programs/freefoodlocator/), offered by Student Life and Campus Engagement, provides students with up-to-the-minute details on the availability of free food on campus as part of their commitment to fostering a supportive, thriving, and united campus community.\nTMU faculty and staff may access the all-inclusive meal option at the Hub Café for $8.75 (tax inclusive), while quantities last. TMU Eats is donating all proceeds from staff and faculty sales to fund future food security programs.\nFor more information on how TMU addresses food insecurity, [visit the TMU Eats website](https://www.torontomu.ca/content/ryerson/tmueats/food-security/).",
