  "text": "University to Offer Summer 2025 Tuition Discount\nGalloway, N.J. — Stockton University will offer a 20% discount on undergraduate summer tuition and fees for students who want to live on campus and work and learn at the shore this summer.\nThe Board of Trustees approved the discount at the Dec. 4 meeting.\nThe goal is to give college students the opportunity to remain in Galloway or Atlantic City campus housing while they take classes or work over the summer.\n\"Summer housing offers students a year-round housing option, providing a stable living environment for those who want to work, study or require consistent accommodations,” said Steven Radwanski, assistant vice president for Student Living and Learning. “Stockton provides students with a continuous home, supporting them as they build their futures.”\nSummer housing begins May 15 and runs through Aug. 9. Stockton academic-year residential students may opt-in to a 12-month contract for summer for an additional fee.\nMore than 350 courses are being offered over the summer, with nearly 250 offered online. With the 20% discount, undergraduate in-state students would pay $398 per credit, or $1,592 per four-credit course, a savings of $396. The discounted rate for undergraduate out-of-state students is $584 per credit or $2,336 per course.\nRegistration for summer courses opens on Feb. 3. There are five summer sessions starting in May and June and lasting either six or 10 weeks, plus 12-week internship and independent study programs.\nLast summer more than 460 students lived at Stockton, including about 250 students participating in the Stockton Atlantic City Summer Experience. The program provided students jobs with one of 18 different area employers, housing primarily at Stockton’s Atlantic City residential halls paid for by the employer, and free educational workshops for participants. Information sessions for the 2025 program are now underway.\nMore information is available at [stockton.edu/summer.](/summer/)",
