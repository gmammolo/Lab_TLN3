  "text": "ATLANTA — Digital access for families can open many doors to education, business and other essential aspects of everyday life. However, without a personal computer at home, that access can be limited.\nThat’s why several organizations in Atlanta are stepping up to help bridge the digital gap while also providing comfort to Atlanta families.\nThis year, the [Food in the City Foundation](/article/life/holidays/food-in-the-city-early-thanksgiving-meals-atlanta/85-8ef08125-0ced-49a9-bbb0-c4f886791a39) is once again hosting a holiday giveaway. For the first time, the foundation is partnering with [Compudopt](https://www.compudopt.org/computergiveaway?gclid=Cj0KCQiAu8W6BhC-ARIsACEQoDBo5xY9uVks8w5DPxO9gxFeZc2em7fo2ez9Y7BBFUKVg6tEU9YROFAaAn7FEALw_wcB) to give 500 families brand-new laptops.\n“We get to partner with Fortune 500 companies, being small, Black-owned businesses, and getting to make a real impact in the community. You can't pay for that,” said Jakeem Smith, founder of the Food in the City Foundation.\nSmith is joining others like Derrick Hayes, the founder of [Big Dave’s Cheesesteaks,](/article/news/local/big-daves-cheesesteaks-new-location-downtown-atlanta-flagship-restaurant/85-10c8655a-348b-43ee-b467-fb944f158c34) for the giveaway on Monday, Dec. 9.\nIn addition to computers, the foundation is partnering with companies like Ashley Furniture, Amazon, Pepsi, AT&T, [Smoot Films](https://www.smootfilms.com/) and others to provide much-needed resources for Atlanta families.\nDerrick Hayes will be there providing meals. The Big Dave's Cheesesteaks founder told 11Alive that the community has to put more focus on helping lift people up, especially those who have climbed themselves.\n“As you climb, you have to lift,” Hayes said. “You can't be the guy that's actually having good things come to you, and you don't put other people in a good position.\"\nHayes added that many children do not have the resources they need.\n\"You know, we could point the finger and say what they're doing and what they're not doing, but what are we doing to change that? And I think right now, this shows what we are doing,” Hayes continued.\nThose interested in attending the giveaway must register with the Food in the City Organization online. Once registered, Smith said that families will receive the location for the Dec. 9 event. To register, [click here](https://foodinthecityatl.com/).",
