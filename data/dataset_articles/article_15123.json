  "text": "NATCHEZ — Angelica King, a senior at Natchez Early College, scored higher than 93 percent of students nationwide on the SAT, a standardized test widely used for college admission.\nThe test scores range from 400 to 1600 points, and King scored 1390, said Natchez Early College Principal Heather Jackson.\nJackson offered public congratulations to King at the Natchez-Adams School District Board meeting on Nov. 21.\n“That means that 93% of the 12th-grade students who took the SAT nationwide scored at or below Angelica’s score. Her reading score is 740, which places her in the 97th percentile for reading. And her math score is 650, which places her in the 85th percentile in math.”\nJackson added King scored comparable on the ACT, another standardized test used by colleges in their admissions process.\nThe highest possible score on the ACT is 36.\nAngelica’s highest ACT score is actually a 32 … and her super score is a 33,” Jackson said.\n“I wanted to publicly congratulate you on a job well done. You are one of the brightest students I’ve ever met in my 14 years in education. So Angelica, congratulations and keep up the good work.”\nKing said it was her second time taking the SAT and third time taking the ACT, where top scores of multiple tests are combined to calculate the super score.\nHer top two college choices are Washington University in St Louis and then the honors college the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg.\nKing said she plans to start college as a biology major with the end goal of becoming a pediatric surgeon.\n“I’ve always enjoyed medicine in general, and then the older I got, I enjoyed helping younger children and working with kids and things of that nature,” she said.\nKing is a member of the Phi Theta Kappa, a college-level honor society she is part of through her dual enrollment at Copiah Lincoln Community College.\nShe and her peers in Phi Theta Kappa this week aired a research documentary they’ve been filming about the Parchment Ordeal, the wrongful incarceration of people during a Civil Rights demonstration that happened in Natchez in 1965.\nThe showing of this documentary was Dec. 4 at the Co-Lin in the multi-purpose room, she said.\n“The leadership board of our chapter worked on it together, which includes me, Demetria Hawkins, Janecia Harrington, Joshua Poole, Adrian Harris, Alvinecia Hammitte, Chatsidy Chatman and Myles Gaines,” she said. “We tried to find historic locations in Natchez. So we filmed at the old NAACP headquarters, at Zion Chapel and at the monument on the bluff. We talked to Ms. Betty Jo Harris at the Historic Foundation and we really primarily used the book that was written a few years back,” The Parchman Ordeal: 1965 Natchez Civil Rights Injustice by the late G. Mark LaFrancis with Robert Morgan and Darrell White.\nKing said she is also involved in the Natchez High School choir, was the Senior Leader of the Mayor’s Youth Council, is the President of the Student Government Association and National Beta Club, President of Phi Theta Kappa and a member of the National Honor Society.\nIn her downtime, King said she enjoys reading, singing and diamond painting — a craft that uses multiple-colored gems on a sticky pad to form an image.\nShe is active in the choir of Christian Hope Baptist Church as well as a youth leader in Sunday School and multiple church activities.\nKing said her biggest role models are her parents first and foremost, Myra King and Steven King, then everyone around her including other family members, teachers, peers and church members.\nAfter graduation, “I’m looking forward to seeing what I’m able to do and all the different things that I’m able to achieve,” King said.",
