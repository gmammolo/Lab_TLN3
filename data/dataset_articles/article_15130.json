  "text": "PHILADELPHIA, PA — The Philadelphia International Music Festival (PIMF) has awarded over $50,000 in scholarships and performance opportunities to talented young musicians over the past year as part of its mission to nurture the next generation of classical performers. The awards were distributed to top participants in PIMF Concerto Competitions, held both online and during its summer festivals.\nOne standout recipient is 19-year-old violinist Josiah Mendenhall of Chester, PA, currently a student at the Cincinnati College-Conservatory. Josiah earned Honorable Mention in the Age 17-19 Division and received a $600 scholarship to participate in PIMF’s intensive classical music training program, featuring instruction by members of The Philadelphia Orchestra.\nJosiah performed a movement from William Walton’s Violin Concerto for his competition piece—a choice driven by his passion for lesser-known works by celebrated composers. Reflecting on his performance, Josiah explained, “I love the intricate melodic lines and the various layering Walton uses in his orchestration. My hope for the audience is that they buckle up and keep an open mind as they experience the dense emotional rollercoaster that is the Walton Violin Concerto.”\nOvercoming the challenges of a congenital birth defect on his right hand, Josiah has proven that his determination and talent are undeniable. With aspirations to build an orchestral career after graduating and possibly pursuing a master’s degree at Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute of Music, he remains committed to his craft. “Music is my life,” Josiah said simply.\nThe Philadelphia International Music Festival offers young musicians the chance to grow and showcase their talents. This year’s spring event featured contributions from participants aged 6 to 19 from around the globe. The upcoming Fall 2024 Virtual Concerto Competition is open for submissions until December 31, 2024.\nFor those seeking direct mentorship from principal players and members of The Philadelphia Orchestra, PIMF provides a summer camp and festival experience designed to inspire and develop aspiring musicians. These programs continue to build bridges for young performers to reach their full potential in the world of classical music. Visit pimf.org for more information.",
