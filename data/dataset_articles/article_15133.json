  "text": "Governor DeWine announces new traffic safety program in Springfield; provides updates on area health, education initiatives\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine visited Springfield Thursday to announce a new traffic safety initiative in Clark County that will train members of the local migrant community on safe driving skills.\nThe Maria Tiberi Foundation and Virtual Driver Interactive donated 10 new driving simulators to the Ohio Department of Public Safety's Ohio Traffic Safety Office for use in Springfield and Clark County. The new simulators have been placed in locations that serve members of the Haitian community who have recently migrated to the area in large numbers and have had little or no driver training.\n“One of the big issues we've seen with migrants in Clark County is that they are not used to driving here,\" said Governor DeWine. \"With the generous donations from the Maria Tiberi Foundation and Virtual Driver Interactive, this new program will help the Haitian population learn the rules of the road and allow them to practice defensive driving skills that can keep everyone on the roads safe.\"\nThis technology will give new drivers the opportunity to experience dangerous driving scenarios and hazards in a simulated environment, allowing them to practice their response to real-world obstacles without putting themselves or others at risk. Training scenarios include driving in severe weather; hydroplaning and skidding; overcorrection; distracted driving; variable traffic density; parallel parking and backing up; dangers of speeding; and the importance of seat belts.\n\"We need to educate our new drivers better and these simulators are a big step in the right direction,\" said Dom Tiberi, cofounder of the Maria Tiberi Foundation. “We want new drivers to learn in a safe environment. Don’t learn it on the highway. I believe the use of simulators is a great educational tool.\"\nThe 10 new driving simulators are located at:\n• Clark County Department of Job and Family Services (2)\n• Clark State College (2)\n• Springfield-Clark Career Technology Center (3)\n• High Street Church of the Nazarene (1)\n• First Haitian Evangelical Church of Springfield (1)\n• Life in Christ Community Church (1).\nUse of the simulators is free and will be managed by trainers and translators at each location. Anyone in Clark County working toward a driver's license can sign up to use the new simulators. Local licensed drivers can also use the simulators to gain additional experience in hazardous driving scenarios.\nAnyone with questions about the simulators should contact the Ohio Traffic Safety Office at .\nGovernor DeWine also Thursday provided an update on ongoing state efforts to surge healthcare support into the Springfield community.\nIn September, Governor DeWine directed the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) to work alongside the Clark County Combined Health District (CCCHD) to acquire a mobile health clinic – part of a $2.5 million commitment to reduce lengthy waitlists for healthcare services for all residents.\nBetween the opening of the mobile clinic and ODH sending nursing staff to support CCCHD’s existing clinic, the backlogs for appointments have largely been eliminated. More than 1,400 area residents have now received immunizations for everything from seasonal vaccinations, as well as vaccines for COVID, flu and RSV. Additionally, these clinics have provided hundreds of blood pressure screenings and referrals to other medical providers.\n“I am proud to say that we have caught up to the need. But our work is far from over. Our next step is making sure the healthcare system in Springfield will continue to efficiently and effectively serve everyone in this community for the long-term,” Governor DeWine said. “We’re now in the process of securing a site for a permanent health clinic. In the coming months, we will transition from the mobile unit to this permanent clinic as we continue to supplement the existing healthcare network in Clark County.”\nOther healthcare updates include:\n• ODH staff have helped register or recertify more than 600 area residents for the Clark County Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to ensure families are able to receive needed supplemental nutrition services.\n• ODH worked alongside Second Harvest Food Pantry to open a baby formula bank, and continues to work with local partners to implement strategies to increase breastfeeding and providing prenatal care to support new mothers and ensure their babies have what they need to thrive.\n• ODH’s Children’s Vision Team has worked with CCCHD and area schools to provide vision screenings for more than 7,600 local students. Now, this team is developing a strategy to secure eyeglasses for children who need them.\nFinally, Governor DeWine discussed progress supporting Springfield-area students in schools affected by the influx of Haitian migrants.\nIn September, the Governor and Ohio Department of Education and Workforce announced the award of over $1.3 million in grant funding to Springfield City School District to support a more productive learning environment for all students.\nTo date, the district has brought in seven interpreters and acquired over 460 translation technology devices to facilitate effective communication with non-English-speaking families and encourage greater parent involvement. The district is also now providing comprehensive mental health services for all students.\nPublisher's note: A free press is critical to having well-informed voters and citizens.
