  "text": "Raritan Valley Community College recently hosted a special Apprenticeship Day event for high school students and adult students in the college’s Advanced Manufacturing Program.\nThe event, which was part of the National Apprenticeship Week celebration Nov. 17-23, welcomed students from Manville and Bound Brook High Schools, along with an apprentice from Triad Tool, a Readington Township machine shop.\nA registered apprenticeship provides an industry-driven, high-quality career pathway that enables employers to build and sustain a skilled workforce, while allowing individuals to gain valuable paid work experience, earn progressive wage increases, receive classroom instruction, and achieve a nationally recognized credential. Programs are industry-approved and validated by the U.S. Labor Department or a state apprenticeship agency.\nThe RVCC event on Nov. 20 featured a presentation on the principles of apprenticeship, followed by firsthand accounts from a manufacturing apprentice. The speakers shared insights into their daily tasks, emphasized the importance of practical learning, and highlighted how apprenticeships promote lifelong professional growth.\nRepresentatives from Triad Tool, spoke about the advantages of incorporating apprentices into their organization, citing benefits such as improved productivity, reduced turnover, and the cultivation of a workforce equipped with critical, industry-valued skills.\nStudents had the unique opportunity to participate in a question-and-answer session with the apprentices, as well as engage in an informal discussion with a representative from Triad Tool. These conversations provided valuable insights into the rewarding career opportunities available in the manufacturing industry.\nFor more information about apprenticeship opportunities, contact Angelo Amante at aamante@raritanval.edu or visit www.apprenticeship.gov . To learn more about RVCC’s Advanced Manufacturing program, go to the college’s website here .\nRaritan Valley Community College is located at 118 Lamington Road in Branchburg.",
