  "text": "After weeks of online learning,all schools in delhi will reopen for in-person classes starting immediately. This decision follows a Supreme Court order allowing ⁢for teh⁣ relaxation⁤ of stringent air pollution control measures‌ in⁤ the ⁢city.\nThe Supreme Court directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) too ​implement⁣ the less restrictive “Stage 2” of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) after Delhi ‘s air quality ‌improved ​to⁤ the “moderate” category. The court emphasized that⁤ it will continue to closely ‌monitor the situation and ​will⁢ reinstate⁤ stricter measures, such as “Stage 3” or “Stage ​4,” if the Air Quality Index (AQI) breaches 350 or ⁣400, respectively.\nThe Central pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported that Delhi’s air quality improved to ‘moderate’ category on ‍Thursday.​ (ANI) The Directorate of Education (DoE) issued a circular stating that all government,government-aided,and⁤ private schools‍ in ‍Delhi are to resume physical classes⁢ with immediate effect. The circular, which had previously mandated online classes due to severe air pollution, has been revoked.\n“All classes in all schools are to be held in physical mode with immediate effect,” the DoE circular read. School heads have been ​instructed to inform students,staff,and parents about the resumption⁣ of in-person learning.\nDelhi’s air quality considerably improved⁤ on Thursday, with the⁢ AQI recorded ⁢at 161, falling into the ‌”moderate” category. this improvement prompted the Supreme Court’s decision to ease the GRAP restrictions.\nThe shift to online classes began on November 17th, initially affecting all grades except‍ for 10th and 12th. Though, due to the persistently poor air quality, classes for ⁢these grades were also moved online the following day.\nunder the stricter “Stage 4” of GRAP, several restrictions‌ were in ‍place, including limitations on diesel-powered vehicles and a mandate ⁣for offices to operate at 50% capacity with the remaining employees working from home. Some⁣ of these‌ restrictions have been lifted under “Stage 2,” but the ban on coal and firewood, including tandoors in⁣ restaurants, remains‍ in effect.\nPlease tell me⁣ more about what you need!\nTo⁢ be a helpful senior editor, I need context. For example:\n* **What kind of writing are we ‍working wiht?** Is it a news⁣ article, ‌a blog post, a novel, a poem, a technical document, or something‍ else?\n* **What ⁢is the target audience?** Who‍ are we trying​ to reach with this piece?\n* **What is the purpose of this‍ piece?** To inform, persuade, entertain, or something else?\n* **What are your ⁤specific ⁣concerns about the writing?** Are there issues ⁣with clarity, style, accuracy, organization, or something ‌else?\n*⁤ **What is the desired ⁤tone and style?** Formal, informal, academic, playful, etc.?\n* **Do you have a ‌style guide I should follow?**\nThe more ⁣data you give me, the better I can definitely help you⁢ polish your writing!",
