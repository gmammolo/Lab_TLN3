The USC​ Viterbi School of Engineering’s USC ⁣+ Amazon​ center for ‌Secure and Trusted Artificial Intelligence has announced its latest round‍ of funded research projects for the 2024-2025 academic year. These projects, chosen through a competitive⁢ process, will tackle critical challenges in⁢ AI⁣ development, ‍focusing on ⁢lasting ⁤model scaling and⁤ optimizing large language‍ models⁤ (LLMs).\nThe center, dedicated‌ to developing ‌secure ⁢and privacy-preserving machine learning solutions, supports faculty-led research projects across various disciplines. This‍ year’s⁣ selected projects highlight the center’s commitment⁢ to advancing ⁢responsible AI development.\nMeet the Researchers The 2024-2025 cohort of researchers includes:\nYifan Chen ,a Ph.D. ⁢student in‌ Computer Science ⁢at USC, advised by Professor ​B. Aditya Prakash. Chen’s research focuses on⁣ responsible deep learning ‍systems within the Energy Efficient Secure Sustainable Computing Group.\nHuihan Li , a third-year Ph.D. ‍student in Computer Science at ⁣USC,⁣ advised by Professor​ Xiang Ren. Li’s research on trustworthy natural​ language processing systems emphasizes improving‍ generalization in language models and optimizing data selection for enhanced model performance. She holds a Master’s⁣ degree in Computer Science from Princeton University.\nTejas Srinivasan , a fourth-year Ph.D.student in Computer Science ⁤at ‍USC,⁤ advised by ‌Professor Jesse Thomason and works in the⁣ GLAMOR ⁣lab. His research focuses on AI systems, and‍ he has previously⁣ completed internships at the Allen⁣ Institute⁣ for AI ‍and Microsoft‍ Research. Before joining ‌USC,he worked as a Research ‌Scientist at the AI Foundation.\nThese talented ‍students will contribute substantially to the center’s mission of advancing​ responsible and trustworthy AI.\n2024-2025 Projects: This year’s⁢ funded‌ projects delve into‍ pressing ‌issues in AI:\n(From left to right) ‍Robin Jia, ‍Salman Avestimehr, seo Jin Park. Their research has been ⁢chosen as sponsored projects ⁣by the USC + ‍Amazon Center. “Mechanistically-Aware Decoding‍ for Ensuring ‍Factuality ⁤During Retrieval⁣ Augmented⁤ Generation” by Professor Robin Jia, assistant professor in the Thomas⁢ Lord Department of ‌Computer Science. Jia leads the AI, Language, Learning, ​Generalization, and Robustness (Allegro) Lab, focusing on building reliable natural language processing systems.\n“linearLLM: Enabling Fast LLM Serving via Attention on ​Top ⁤Principal Keys”‍ by Professor Salman Avestimehr,Dean’s Professor in the Electrical & Computer Engineering ‍and Computer Science Departments. He‍ also serves as the director of the USC+amazon ⁤Center.\n“Disaggregated Mixture of Experts Serving for Sustainable Model Scaling” by Professor Seo Jin Park, assistant professor in⁤ the Thomas Lord Department of⁤ Computer Science. ⁤Prior to joining USC, Park was a member‍ of the ⁣Google Systems Research Group.\nThese‍ projects represent a significant step forward ‍in addressing the challenges and opportunities​ presented by‍ the ​rapid advancement‌ of AI technology.\nthe University‌ of Southern California (USC) and Amazon ⁢recently ⁣hosted the ‌fourth annual kickoff meeting for ‍their joint Center for Responsible and ‌Trustworthy AI.‌ The event, held on the⁣ USC campus, brought together leading researchers, faculty, and‌ graduate ‍student fellows to launch a new wave of groundbreaking projects in the field of artificial intelligence.\nThe​ meeting featured keynote speeches, presentations on the selected research projects, ⁤and introductions to the new cohort of‌ graduate student fellows. Attendees also had the opportunity to engage in discussions with USC faculty and Amazon⁢ scientists, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n“This year’s ⁢projects build on the ⁤strengths of ‌the Amazon-USC Center in responsible and​ trustworthy AI and advance important research ‍questions from methods for⁤ reducing hallucinations to improving inference efficiency,” said Daniel Marcu, Vice ⁢President of Artificial General Intelligence​ at Amazon.\n“It was inspiring to be on the USC campus for the fall research kick-off event which brought together the newly awarded⁢ faculty and fellows with scientists ⁢from across Amazon’s⁤ Artificial General Intelligence team to launch these new collaborations,”\nMarcu added, highlighting the collaborative spirit of the initiative.\nPrevious ⁢research funded⁢ by the center has yielded significant advancements, including innovative work on private labeling for voice‌ assistants with‌ cameras and decentralized learning approaches. Over the past three years, the center has also supported numerous projects in deep learning, a powerful subset of machine learning ⁢with applications in image recognition, natural language⁤ processing, and speech recognition.\n“It is​ indeed great‌ to see the excellent quality and wide ⁤range of ‍research ⁢topics awarded in this year’s USC + Amazon competition,” said ‌Yannis‌ C.

Here are some suggestions ⁤to make it even stronger:\n**Content:**\n* **lead with Impact:** The opening paragraph could be‍ more compelling.Instead​ of starting with a general description, highlight the importance of the center’s work⁣ and⁢ its‌ potential impact on‌ society. For example: _”The USC + Amazon Center for Secure and Trusted Artificial Intelligence is addressing a critical challenge of our time: building ⁤AI systems we can rely on. Today, the center announced its latest round of research ​projects, each focused on advancing‍ responsible and ⁣trustworthy⁢ AI development.”_\n* **Expand⁢ on Project Descriptions:** While you mention the project titles, delve a bit deeper into what each project aims to achieve. What are the specific problems they ‌are addressing? What are the potential benefits of their research?\n* **Highlight Amazon’s Role:**⁤ ⁣Clarify the‌ nature​ of Amazon’s involvement. is this purely financial sponsorship, or are Amazon scientists actively involved in the research?\n**Structure and Style:**\n* ⁢**Subheadings:** Consider adding‍ more subheadings to break up the text and improve readability (e.g., “A Focus on Trustworthy⁢ NLP,” “Scaling Up AI Responsibly”).\n* **Quotes:** Including⁤ quotes ​from the professors and/or students involved in the projects can add personality and insight.\n* **Call to Action:** ⁢ ⁢If applicable, ​consider adding a call ‍to action ​at the end.Such as, encourage people to learn more⁤ about the ​center’s work on their website ​or to⁢ get involved in AI research.\n* **Proofread:** Carefully proofread the entire⁣ release for any typos, grammatical errors, or awkwardly phrased sentences.\n**Additional Tips:**\n* **Target Audience:** Keep your target⁤ audience in mind. ⁣Are you writing ⁤for the general public, ⁤AI researchers, potential funders, or a combination?\n* **Visuals:** The image of the fellows is great. Consider adding ⁤other visuals, such as graphics illustrating the research⁣ projects or​ photos of the professors in action.\nBy incorporating these suggestions, you can create a powerful press release that effectively communicates the importance of the USC ​+ Amazon Center’s work in ⁤advancing secure and trusted AI.",
