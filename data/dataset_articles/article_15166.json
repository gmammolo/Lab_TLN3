A new grant could help. The 2024 Second Chance Act Grant on Improving Reentry Education will help people pursue a secondary education while incarcerated. Future students will take online courses through state colleges and universities including BSC and Valley City State University. Residents will be able to earn online degrees or certifications while incarcerated. Staff said education helps people who are incarcerated stay out of prison. “What we have seen on a national standard is that inmates that receive a four-year degree or at least a two-year degree, their recidivism rate drops dramatically, and they’re more desirable for employment,” said Charlie Hedden, grants manager. The North Dakota Department of Corrections (ND DOCR) has been working to expand post-secondary options. “So previous to that, residents could participate in college. However, they would be paying for the full tuition and fees all on their own. When you’re incarcerated, I mean, many people do work, but the wages of the jobs here are not what the wages are in the community,” said Michelle Pfaff, director of education. She said the grant money will go towards the equipment needed to complete the degrees. This three-year federal grant will make education more accessible. “And so, we are establishing the relationships now because this is just the beginning of the possibilities of what we can do. Once we have the technology infrastructure in place, we can branch out to other locations across the state that want to participate,” said Hedden. Already, one student is enrolled in classes through Valley City State University. ND DOCR staff said the program was pushed forward when federal Pell Grant funds became accessible for individuals who are incarcerated. Copyright 2024 KFYR. All rights reserved.",
