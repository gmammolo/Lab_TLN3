  "text": "Mercy Health – Youngstown Diabetes Education Earns Recognition from the American Diabetes Association\nThe ADA’s Education Recognition Program certification ensures quality diabetes education and support for people living with diabetes.\nYOUNGSTOWN, OH (November 7, 2024) – The American Diabetes Association® (ADA) — the nation’s leading organization committed to fighting diabetes — recently announced the recognition of Mercy Health – Youngstown Diabetes Education through their Education Recognition Program (ERP).\nThe ADA’s ERP certificate assures that educational services meet the National Standards for DSMES. The corresponding intervention provided is evidence-based and outcome driven. Services apply for recognition voluntarily and ADA-ERP recognition lasts for four years.\n“DSMES is essential part of managing diabetes and is as affective as diabetes medication. Therefore, all people with diabetes benefit from it,” said Barbara Eichorst, MS, RD, CDCES, the ADA’s vice president of health programs. “We applaud Mercy Health – Youngstown Diabetes Education for its commitment to providing value-based interventions such as DSMES, maximizing corresponding outcomes, and patient experience.”\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Diabetes Fact Sheet, there are over 38 million people, or 11.6%, of the U.S. population who have diabetes. While an estimated 29.7 million have been diagnosed, unfortunately 8.7 million people are not aware they have this disease. Each day, nearly 3,300 Americans are diagnosed with diabetes. Many will first learn they have diabetes when they are treated for one of its life-threatening complications—heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, nerve disease, or amputation. Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death in the U.S.—in 2021, it contributed to 399,401 deaths. The ADA’s Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S. in 2022 report confirms diabetes continues to be one of the nation’s most expensive chronic health care conditions with an estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes of $412.9 billion.\n“It is so important for all people with diabetes to participate in diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) to help acquire the skills they need to manage their disease and problem-solve during this significant time in their lives. The benefits of this education are numerous and can make the difference in the longevity of someone with diabetes. These benefits include decreased hospitalizations and A1C levels, weight loss, and reduction in medication and dosing, as well as overall prevention of complications related to the illness,” said Debbie Hlad, RDN, CDCES, LD, Diabetes Education Manager and Diabetes Education Dietitian for the Mercy Health – Youngstown Diabetes Education program. “Our team of registered dietitian nutritionists and registered nurses, who are Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, lead group and individual education sessions by appointment. We also have a team of providers ready to help you manage your diabetes.”\nTo learn more about the Mercy Health – Youngstown Diabetes Education program, individuals can call 330-480-2676, Monday through Friday, from 8 am to 4:30 PM.\n[Learn more](http://professional.diabetes.org/diabetes-education/?utm_source=Offline&utm_medium=Print&utm_content=erp&utm_campaign=ERP) about the ADA’s ERP and other ERP-certified services.\n###\nAbout Mercy Health – Youngstown\nMercy Health - Youngstown is part of\n[Bon Secours Mercy Health](https://bsmhealth.org/) one of the 20 largest health systems in the United States and the fifth-largest Catholic health system in the country.
