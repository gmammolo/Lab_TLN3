  "text": "The Athletic Students Training Program at University High School (UHS), initiated by head athletic trainer Julia Cendejas, is providing students interested in sports medicine with invaluable hands-on experience. Launched last year with just two students, participation has surged to about ten, with expectations of further growth as interest in the program increases. Students learn essential skills including basic anatomy, injury treatment, rehabilitation protocols, and practical applications like taping and ice bag preparation. The program stands out for its flexible, self-driven participation model, allowing students to coordinate their training around their schedules. By the Numbers- Program began with 2 students in the previous year. - Current enrollment is about 10 students, with expectations for growth. - The program operates without a fixed meeting schedule or membership requirements. - Students interested in participating independently express their interest and coordinate with the trainer. As interest grows, Cendejas hopes to expand the program further, potentially leading to the establishment of a comprehensive sports medicine curriculum at UHS. With additional student involvement, there may be enhanced athletic training support for UHS teams. Bottom LineThe establishment of the Athletic Students Training Program at UHS not only equips students with hands-on experience in sports medicine but also lays the groundwork for a more robust athletic training program, advocating the importance of this field in high school athletics.
