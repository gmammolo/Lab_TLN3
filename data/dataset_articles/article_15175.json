  "text": "The Department of History and Theory of Fine Arts at the Faculty of Decorative and Applied Arts of the State Academy of Arts of Turkmenistan is actively involved in commemorating significant events and personalities in the history of national culture. This year, the department released a series of publications dedicated to important dates and anniversaries of outstanding figures in fine arts.\nFor instance, postcards with reproductions of the most famous works by Ayhan Hajiev, People's Artist of Turkmenistan, were issued for his 100th birthday. Among them is the canonical portrait of Magtymguly Fragi, which was recognized in 1947 as the best artistic embodiment of the great Turkmen poet's image.\nEach postcard offers a unique excursion into the history of Turkmen portrait painting, allowing viewers to appreciate Hajiev's distinctive works. The project author, Guljeren Mammedaliyeva, compiled key facts from the artist's biography in the publication, enabling not only enjoyment of his art but also a deeper study of his life path and contribution to art.\nMonumental works by Saragt Babaev, Hero of Turkmenistan, People's Artist of the country, two-time laureate of the Magtymguly International Prize, and honorary elder, were meticulously studied by future art historian Oguljan Dayyeva.\nThe series of informative postcards includes photographic images of monuments and sculptures created by this outstanding sculptor. One of his latest significant works is a giant statue of Magtymguly Fragi that adorned the foothills of Kopetdag during the 300th anniversary celebration of the poet's birth.\nEqually interesting are calendars, booklets, brochures and albums highlighting significant events in the life of the creative university. For example, following the \"Türkmen alabaýy\" exhibition-competition, a catalog with students' works was published. Among new publications is a booklet created from Persian painting master classes that concluded with an exhibition by students studying miniature, graphics and calligraphy.\n\"Our future art historians make great efforts to ensure that no event in the life of the country and the Academy goes unnoticed,\" says Ayjan Kadyrova, head of the Department of History and Theory of Fine Arts.\nYoung specialists independently develop concepts and designs for books, calendars and postcards, striving to convey not only visual but also informative context to readers. All these publications are added to the Academy's library so that future generations can study the stages of development of Turkmenistan's fine arts.\nThese days, a creative exhibition \"Gujurly ýaşlar\" (\"Energetic Youth\") is taking place at the gallery of the State Academy of Arts. It has become a true celebration for showcasing innovative art by young authors. Visitors can also explore printed materials created by talented art historians.",
