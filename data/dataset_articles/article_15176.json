  "text": "A Hopland teen is one of two California high school students recently chosen to represent the state in the United States Senate Youth Program, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond announced this week.\nIn a press release, Thurmond introduced the “two extraordinary high school students (chosen) to represent California in the 63rd annual United States Senate Youth Program as Sarah Gao of San Diego, a senior at Canyon Crest Academy, and Bode Gower of Hopland, a senior at Ukiah High School,” describing both teens as having been “selected for their exceptional leadership skills, noteworthy commitments to their schools and communities, and academic and extracurricular achievements as California’s delegates in this highly competitive program.”\nThese “students have demonstrated strong leadership and a passion for making positive changes through advocacy work on issues such as environmental science, rural education, equity, mental health awareness, health education, and social justice,” Thurmond continued. “Their desire to help underserved communities is admirable — they have set a good example and are excellent role models for their peers and adults.”\n“I’m so honored and humbled to be selected to the USSYP,” said Gower, who is Associate Student Body President at Ukiah High and also “serves as student representative to the Ukiah Unified School District Advisory Committee and a member of the Superintendent’s Advisory Committee where he represents the student voice on the district strategic plan/LCAP and various initiatives.”\n“(Bode) has always had this drive to achieve, it’s innate,” said Mendocino County Sheriff Matt Kendall, who knew Gower’s father Marty before marrying one of Gower’s cousins, Melissa.\n“Marty had a small rodeo arena in Hopland where we used to rope back in the 1980s,” said Kendall, explaining that Marty was 10 years older than him, and died several years ago from cancer.\nAfter his father’s death, Bode asked Kendall to escort him to Mass at his church, and Kendall said they try and go together about twice a month.\nKendall described Gower as always having natural leadership qualities and an ability to influence those around him, especially young people.\n“Plus he’s a handsome little stinker,” Kendall said. “He reminds me of his dad.”\nUkiah High senior Bode Gower on a visit to the U.S. Capitol earlier this year. (Contributed – courtesy of Matt Kendall) Kendall added that while he is definitely proud of both Gower’s achievements so far and his future ambitions, he will also be sad if the teen achieves his goal of going to college on the East Coast, as he doesn’t want another young family member to be so far away.\n“Though I told him if he makes it to the presidency, then I get to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom at least once!” Kendall said with a laugh.\nTo qualify for the USSYP, “students must be (junior or seniors) nominated by their high school principals (and) be actively serving in an elected or appointed leadership position where they represent a constituency in organizations related to student government, education, public affairs, and/or community service as well as express an interest in pursuing a career in public service,” the press release explains, adding that “two student leaders from each state, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense Education Activity each receive a $10,000 undergraduate scholarship and an all-expenses-paid trip to Washington, D.C. for Washington Week” in March of 2025.\nIn addition, the delegates and their alternates “are scheduled to be recognized by the State Board of Education during its January meeting in Sacramento next month.",
