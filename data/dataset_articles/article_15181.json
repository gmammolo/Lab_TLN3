  "text": "A growing number of people show immense enthusiasm for attending distance courses in the DPRK.\nFor example, the online education faculty of Pyongyang Han Tok Su University of Light Industry has admitted a larger number of students every year.\nStarting with distance education for working people at factories and enterprises in the light industry sector, the faculty has now as many as 10 000 people as students.\nAmong them are officials of industrial establishments, scientists, technicians, educators, workers and honoured disabled ex-soldiers.\nMore and more people apply for online courses as these cover a wide range of teaching contents and every student can attend lectures in any place and at any time and receive on the spot answers to various sci-tech problems arising in practice.\nThe dean of the faculty said large numbers of online course students have graduated from the university so far, adding that the faculty has produced many PhDs and MScs and that, among the students who would finish the courses in the near future, there are many inventors who have already contributed to the development of their units by skilfully applying what they learned.\n“Whenever I run into a knotty problem during work, I go to the sci-tech learning space. Then I can solve it quickly,” said a worker receiving online education at the Taedonggang Foodstuff Factory.\nThere are a growing number of such students at many production units including the Songdowon General Foodstuff Factory, Taedonggang Brewery and Pyongyang Children's Foodstuff Factory.\nAs the study-while-you-work system is in operation throughout the country and there is a sci-tech learning space at each industrial establishment, everyone can acquire new knowledge to become talents and they regard it as every citizen’s duty to contribute to the development of the country by dint of science and technology.",
