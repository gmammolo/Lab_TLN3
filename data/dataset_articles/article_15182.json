  "text": "At the School of Public Policy, students can step directly into the world of defense strategy. Through a collaboration with the Department of Defense (DoD), they are tackling critical issues and gaining hands-on experience in policy analysis on issues related to national security.\nLast spring, eight students in the PLCY690/790 project course—including five from the section taught by Research Professor and CISSM Research Director David Backer—developed research projects through a partnership with the DoD. These opportunities highlight the role that emerging policy professionals play in advancing national defense objectives. This emphasizes the School’s role in bridging academia and government to address pressing global challenges.\nStudents undertook these projects on topics ranging from European deterrence to supply chain security, working closely with DoD subject matter experts to refine project scopes, gather feedback and present findings at the Pentagon. This experience, designed to enhance the practical application of policy education, prepared SPP graduates to step into impactful national defense roles. One student is now working within the DoD, while another has joined the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. A third graduate has taken on a position with the Department of the Navy after an independent DoD project.\nBeyond the DoD Initiative, Backer has also served as faculty mentor for three projects in the Research for Intelligence and Security Challenges (RISC) program operated by UMD's Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security. The RISC program pairs teams of student interns with DoD clients to solve complex defense issues. Recent collaborations that Backer has mentored have included projects for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Science and Technology Program Protection.\nAs the DoD Initiative continues this academic year, SPP students are once again gaining valuable insights into national defense and security. Seven students have already been matched with DoD clients, including five of Backer’s current students.",
