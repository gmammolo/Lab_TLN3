  "text": "SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine — There is a critical shortage of cybersecurity personnel across the country. To address this urgent need, scholarships are being offered to students studying the field, providing them a pathway to join the country’s frontline defense against cyber threats. At Southern Maine Community College , the next generation of cybersecurity professionals is already hard at work. “Right now, we’re at about 140 current students,” Wendy Plourde, a professor of cybersecurity at SMCC, said. Inside the school’s computer lab, students are learning foundational skills that will prepare them to combat cyber threats. “It’s all starting out with networks and servers and how to secure those,” Plourde explained. “That gives them a good foundation.” RELATED: Brewer schools expand career opportunities with $1.2 million grant For these students, there’s a new opportunity on the horizon. The Cyber Service Academy, part of the U.S. Department of Defense, is offering scholarships to students studying cybersecurity and related fields. “This is a really big deal for a lot of students,” Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said. “It’s also important for the country and for Maine.” Eligible students from SMCC, the University of Maine at Augusta, and the University of Southern Maine can apply. Recipients will receive full tuition, stipends for books and housing, and guaranteed post-graduation employment. King said this program comes at a time when the need for cybersecurity professionals has never been greater. “I was visiting a small regional bank in Maine not long ago, and they are being attacked 100,000 times a week,” he said. King noted that most of the risk lies in the private sector, which faces a growing number of cyber threats targeting sensitive systems. RELATED: Portland Hearts of Pine continues multimillion-dollar stadium upgrades \"Eighty-five percent of the target space in cyber is in the private sector—whether it’s telecommunications, water systems, banks, transportation—so there’s this enormous need,” King explained. “Then, of course, these adversaries are definitely coming after our national security assets.” The Cyber Service Academy scholarships will not only provide Maine students with a quality education but also offer a direct gateway to meaningful careers where they can help protect the nation from evolving cyber threats, according to King.
