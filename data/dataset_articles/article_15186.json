These tickets are digital and were sent on Wednesday, Nov. 20.\nTickets will not be required for the graduate commencement this fall.\nWhere should I park?\nFor both commencements, parking is free and available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests are suggested to park at South Campus Deck (S11), Carlton Street Deck (S15) and Foley Field Lot (S14). The McPhaul Lot (S10) and the Coverdell Lot (S16) are reserved for designated participants by permit only.\nParking for guests with disabilities will be available in the Hoke Smith Annex Lot (S12) adjacent to Stegeman Coliseum. The main entrances to Stegeman Coliseum along Sanford Drive and Carlton Street are wheelchair-accessible.\nWho are the speakers?\nThe scheduled undergraduate commencement ceremony speaker will be Judge Lisa Godbey Wood, a 1990 summa cum laude graduate of the UGA School of Law and a 1985 First Honor Graduate of UGA.\nJohn Anthony Maltese, associate dean of the School of Public and International Affairs and the Albert B.

Additional family members will have to sit separately in the general seating area.\nWhat am I allowed to bring?\nThere is a clear bag policy for both commencement ceremonies. This means guests and students should not bring bookbags.

Guests who may need one are encouraged to bring their own.\nStudents should leave purses, coats and other belongings with family members, and should pick a place to meet family and friends once the ceremony is complete.\nOnce graduates have found their seat, they should remain in them and not stand in the aisles.",
