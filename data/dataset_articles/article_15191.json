  "text": "Fifth-year public health sciences major Alejandro Martinez Santos was named this year’s recipient of the Public Health Alumni Board Scholarship. Originally, Santos was leaning towards computer science and earth system science, he eventually found his calling in public health due to its unique intersection of basic sciences within a social application. He felt public health offers a balance of biology and human-centered impact — a perfect blend that aligns with his passion for understanding environmental health, specifically around pulmonary diseases and toxic environmental hazards.\nAs he prepares to pursue a doctoral degree in public health, Santos reflects on the influence UC Irvine has had on his college journey and shares his goals with the Wen Public Health community for advancing public health research.\nWhat does receiving this scholarship mean to you personally and professionally?\nReceiving this scholarship is a huge relief in terms of alleviating some of the financial burden of higher education, but it also feels like an acknowledgment of my work in public health. This recognition is especially meaningful for me as a non-citizen student, as it highlights the importance of institutional support for those of us who can’t access federal funds.\nThere’s a substantial gap in unmet needs that government assistance doesn’t cover, so knowing UC Irvine is helping to bridge that gap is incredibly reassuring. For me, one of the most immediate benefits will be the ability to afford more nutritious food. Food insecurity is a significant issue for many students, and access to quality nutrition is both a personal and a public health concern. This scholarship will allow me to buy healthier food options rather than having to settle for less nutritious, convenient choices.\nHow does this scholarship impact your academic journey and future career plans?\nI plan to become a professor, which will involve applying for grants and other funding sources. Looking back, I’ll remember this scholarship as one of my first recognitions — financial support that affirmed me as a public health professional in the making. This validation means a lot as I work towards becoming an expert in the field. My experience as a low-income and first-generation student has given me a unique perspective on public health. For many without legal citizenship, public health can seem intimidating, so it’s important for me to bridge that gap and promote trust between communities and public health institutions.\nWhat inspired you to pursue a degree in public health, and what drew you to UC Irvine for your studies?\nI was drawn to public health at UC Irvine because of the unique opportunities here, especially within the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health. Given the newness of Wen Public Health, it’s exciting for me as it offers more chances to contribute to the school’s growth and initiatives. Public health is a perfect blend of science and community impact — it connects biological discoveries, like identifying environmental toxins, to real-world applications like policy and outreach.\nCould you tell us more about your current research or areas of focus in public health?\nI’m currently an undergraduate research assistant in the Air Pollution Health Effects Lab within the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, where I work under [Dr. Andrea De Vizcaya Ruiz](https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/de-vizcaya-ruiz-andrea/) and Jayveeritz Bautista, a PhD candidate. My research focuses on e-cigarette exposure and the sex-specific effects it has on disease progression, particularly concerning inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis, or lung scarring. My plan is to apply to PhD program in environmental health, where I’ll be able to delve deeper into this field, potentially exploring asthma and other pulmonary issues as they relate to environmental justice.\nDo you have any advice for underclassmen students?\nFor non-citizen and undocumented students, my advice is to seek out the community — there are resources like the [Dream Center](https://dream.uci.edu/) and organizations like [Students Advocating for Immigrant Rights and Equity](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/safire/home/) that provide support. For those students in general that are interested in public health, if it feels too broad, explore the specific departments within it, such as environmental health, biostatistics, or disease prevention. Public health offers so many avenues to impact government, research, healthcare, and policy. Finally, I encourage everyone to get involved in research. UC Irvine’s status as an R1 institution means there’s a wealth of opportunities to contribute to and learn from groundbreaking studies.",
