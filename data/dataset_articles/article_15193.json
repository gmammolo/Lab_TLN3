  "text": "By Patty Coller ,\n3 hours ago\n(WKBN) – A bill that would address expulsion in Ohio’s schools and how those students return to class has passed the House of Representatives.\nHouse Bill 206 establishes a policy that allows superintendents to expel a student for no longer than 180 days for posing an imminent and severe danger to other students and employees.\nState Rep. Monica Blasdel (R-Columbiana), a co-sponsor of the bill, said that she was prompted to look for solutions after a constituent told her about a student who had been expelled but was set to return without any type of assessment.\n“This bill will combat that, providing greater flexibility and more control to school administrators when dealing with the most difficult and stressful cases they encounter,” Blasdel said.\nThe bill will require superintendents to develop conditions for a student’s reinstatement to include an assessment by a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist.\nIf the returning student does not meet the assessment criteria, the superintendent could extend the expulsion by 90 more days before another assessment, and there is no limit on the number of times that can be done.\nThe bill defines “imminent and severe endangerment” as one of the following four threats:\nBringing a firearm or a knife capable of causing serious bodily injury to school, a property owned or controlled by the school board, or to an interscholastic competition, extracurricular event, or other program or activity sponsored by the school district or in which the district is a participant; Committing an act that is a criminal offense when committed by an adult and that results in serious physical harm to persons or property while at any of the above locations; Making a bomb threat to a school building or to any premises at which a school activity is occurring at the time of the threat; or Making an articulated or verbalized threat, including a hit list, threatening manifesto, or social media post, that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the student poses a serious threat. The bill’s next stop is the Ohio Senate.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
