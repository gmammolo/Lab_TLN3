  "text": "Posted on December 5, 2024 by\nJoseph Torres started his journey at UTSA as an undergraduate, and now is set to receive his Ph.D. in psychology. As a military veteran, Torres felt supported by UTSA's strong community.\nWhat made you decide to attend UTSA?\nI chose to attend UTSA for its strong U.S. Military Veteran community. I was looking for a university that would make my transition back into civilian life easier and found exactly what I was looking for here.\nWhat made you choose your major?\nI chose to major in psychology because I have always been interested in how the mind processes information. I was drawn towards researching the effects of news media on mental health after being an editor for The Paisano at UTSA. I was fortunate to find a mentor who encouraged me to explore my research interests along my academic journey.\nWhat has been your favorite moment/experience at UTSA?\nMy favorite moment at UTSA was meeting my wife at The Paisano when I was a News Editor in undergrad.\nHow did your degree shape your future goals?\nMy degree has provided me with the opportunity to help build a new area of psychological research. Media literacy is an expanding interdisciplinary field and my contributions, from a psychological perspective, aim to help build this growing discipline.\nWhat accomplishment are you most proud of from your time in college?\nMy most proud moment from my time in college is definitely the successful defense of my doctoral dissertation. I spent years researching and exploring novel ways to contribute to the field of psychology. I am very proud to have found a niche to make my own.\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced during your college years, and how did you overcome it?\nMy biggest challenge was navigating graduate school as a first-generation student. I leveraged the advice of my advisor and the resources UTSA offered for graduate students to help me overcome this challenge. My sister also started her graduate school journey at the same time and we leaned on each other when things got tough.\nIf you could give advice to incoming students, what would it be?\nIdeas are like trying on different hats; you can try different ones on and wear them around for a while but don’t forget that you can also take them off if they no longer fit you. Observe everyone, listen more than you speak, and pay attention.\nWhat are your post-graduation plans?\nI am currently an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at Austin Community College. I am also working on my clinical license to practice therapy. My ultimate goal is to own a private practice while I continue teaching and researching on the side.\nIf your years at UTSA had a theme song, what would it be?\nI’m Still Standing: Elton John\nWhat’s your go-to comfort food for stressful study sessions?\nA beef fajita burrito from Taco Palenque with a small order of chips and queso and a Dr. Pepper.\nWhat surprised you the most about college life?\nThe pandemic was a pretty big surprise. My first year of graduate school was entirely online.\nHow do you want to use your degree to make a difference in your community or field?\nI want to increase awareness around the importance of media literacy, especially as artificial intelligence technologies increase and the sources of information we consume online becomes more obscured. We all bear the responsibility of knowing the sources of information we consume before sharing it with others.\nIf you had to sum up your college experience in three words, what would they be?\nI did it!\nWhat’s one piece of advice that you received during college that you’ll carry with you?\nCollege is an endurance race; life is no different. Knowing what you need to get to the finish line is better than trying to get there as fast as you can.",
