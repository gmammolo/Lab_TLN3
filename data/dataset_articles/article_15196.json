  "text": "Posted on December 5, 2024 by\nAniah Dave is graduating with a bachelor's degree in public health. The First-Gen student has plans to attend graduate school to pursue a master of public health.\nWhat made you decide to attend UTSA?\nI attended UTSA to stay close to home! It was a good choice, at the time when I wanted to go into nursing, they had a program I was interested in.\nWhat made you choose your major?\nI initially chose my major to go into nursing. However, as I took more public health classes, I fell in love with it and had to change my career plans.\nWhat has been your favorite moment/experience at UTSA?\nMy favorite experience at UTSA was becoming involved with the Public Health Society. It opened a new horizon for me, and I eventually joined the leadership board.\nHow did your degree shape your future goals?\nIt shaped my future goals by giving me more than one option in healthcare. I realized how much I loved learning and fighting for health equity/disparities, especially in sexual health.\nWhat accomplishment are you most proud of from your time in college?\nI am most proud of being the first in my family to graduate from college – it's something I worked hard for, and it feels like a huge accomplishment. Now, I'm excited to take the next step and pursue a graduate degree, not just for me, but for my family too.\nWhat was the biggest challenge you faced during your college years, and how did you overcome it?\nDuring college, I faced a constant battle with depression, which left me feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from everything around me. The fear of an uncertain future only deepened my struggles, making it difficult to see beyond my immediate challenges. This combination of emotional and mental turmoil often made it hard to stay motivated, and I found myself questioning whether I would ever overcome it. I overcame these challenges by reaching out for help through therapy and the wellness center on campus. Talking to a therapist helped me manage my depression and fear of the future, while the wellness center gave me the support I needed. With their help, I slowly started to feel more stable and focused and was able to move forward.\nIf you could give advice to incoming students, what would it be?\nIf I could give advice to incoming students, It would be to get involved! You really discover yourself when you put yourself out there. Once I joined an organization, it shaped my college years and led me to better experiences and opportunities!\nWhat are your post-graduation plans, if any?\nI plan on attending graduate school to earn a Masters in Public Health. I just submitted applications so wish me luck!\nIf your years at UTSA had a theme song, what would it be?\nMy theme song would be LOST! by RM. It summed up my early thoughts about University for sure.\nWhat’s your go-to comfort food for stressful study sessions?\nMy go-to comfort food for stressful study sessions is definitely sour patch straws. The RowdyMart saw me daily.\nWhat surprised you the most about college life?\nI was surprised how fast it went by! I swear I was just moving into the dorms yesterday.\nHow do you want to use your degree to make a difference in your community or field?\nI want to make healthcare, sexual health, and reproductive health more attainable for queer communities of color and low-income communities! As the current political state of our country becomes more unpredictable, my unwavering worry is for the queer population who already struggle with obtaining help in healthcare.\nIf you had to sum up your college experience in three words, what would they be?\nIn three words it would be\nWhat’s one piece of advice that you received during college that you’ll carry with you?\nA piece of advice I received while at UTSA was to \"slow down\". It is a simple phrase, but it is true. My mind was running at a million miles throughout university, making my experience here tainted. It wasn't until I slowed down and learned how to appreciate the little things and make the most of it that I started to love college.",
