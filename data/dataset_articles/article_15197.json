The winners will be displayed in the Great Hall of the Culture Center in Charleston for the rest of the season, along with the other submitted ornaments. The First Lady Student Ornament Competition had 144 entries from 23 West Virginia counties. “I’m absolutely delighted with the incredible creativity we’ve seen in this year’s Student Ornament Competition,” First Lady Justice said. “Our theme, Santa Claus, brought out so much talent and imagination from students all across West Virginia. Congratulations to our four winning classrooms, and a heartfelt thank-you to everyone who participated. It’s always such a joy to see the effort and artistry our students put into their work. These ornaments will add a special touch to the Culture Center this holiday season.” Each winning class was awarded a $100 gift card to purchase art supplies.
