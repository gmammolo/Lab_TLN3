  "text": "Graduates of Mary Immaculate College (MIC) were recently asked to describe their college experience in one word. Life-changing, memorable, creative, close-knit, vibrant, and amazing are just some of the superlatives they used. To find out more about what makes MIC such an inspiring place to study, join us on Saturday, 18 January (10am-1pm) on our Limerick campus for the [MIC January Open Day](https://www.mic.ul.ie/study-at-mic/cao-hub/open-days).\nOn the day prospective students will get the opportunity to explore our Limerick campus and discover all that the College has to offer from its range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, extracurricular activities, exceptional facilities, and supportive learning environment. The event will include programme talks on MIC’s [undergraduate degrees](https://www.mic.ul.ie/study-at-mic/undergraduates) on offer at MIC Limerick and MIC Thurles, as well as talks on the College’s over [30 postgraduate programmes](https://www.mic.ul.ie/study-at-mic/postgraduates), offered from graduate diploma to doctoral level across the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Education.\nAs well as post-primary school students, parents, and prospective postgraduate students, the Open Day is a great opportunity for mature students to discover why returning to education offers a unique and enriching experience. With a wealth of life experience and practical knowledge, mature students often bring a fresh perspective to their studies, whether they are returning to education for career advancement, personal growth, or to pursue a new passion.\nAccording to mature student Pat Savage, ‘I was a farmer for about 45 years. I didn’t go to university. It wasn’t the thing in my time, but it was always at the back of my mind. I’m now doing the Bachelor of Arts at MIC studying English, History, Philosophy, and Drama and Theatre Studies. Being a mature student is different, obviously. The majority of students are post-leaving certificate and I’m a long-time since post-leaving cert but after the first week or two, you settle in because it’s a community here. It’s a very friendly place. A lot of people know you on first-name terms. You feel part of it, which is great, especially for someone coming back to education after a long, long time. I’m really delighted that I came back and delighted that I picked MIC.’\nAt postgraduate level, Faculty, and [Research and Graduate School](https://www.mic.ul.ie/research/research-graduate-school/research-graduate-school), members will be on hand to answer questions about MIC’s wide range of taught and research programmes. The College is a long-established provider of world-class postgraduate opportunities and focuses on student success and well-being and meeting real-world needs in diverse workplaces, both nationally and internationally. Students experience responsive research supervision and mentoring, funding and career development support schemes, and a first-class community of practice.\nOpen Day attendees will also be able to learn about [MIC’s range of scholarships and funding](https://www.mic.ul.ie/study-at-mic/scholarships) opportunities, such as undergraduate entrance scholarships, postgraduate scholarships, sports scholarships, and other awards and bursaries.\nCan’t make the Open Days?
