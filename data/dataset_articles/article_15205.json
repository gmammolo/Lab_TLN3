  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — On Thursday, students and staff at Robert Lee Frost School 106 cut the ribbon on a new media center.\n\"Today is an incredibly exciting day,\" said Indianapolis Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Aleesia Johnson.\nIt's all thanks to a collaboration between the IPS Foundation, Big Ten Conference, and the College Football Playoff Foundation, among others.\n\"It means a lot when our students can see that outside of the school, there are so many other people who are rooting for their success and supporting them,\" said Johnson. \"So to have them experience that today is very special.\"\nThe renovation comes in conjunction with the Discover Big Ten Football Championship Game. It's complete with new books, furniture and backpacks full of supplies.\nKyrie Woods is a second grader at School 106.\n\"I would say thank you for making it, because I like this school,\" said Woods, \"and I want to try some new books.\"\nIndiana Sports Corp helped select School 106 for the surprise.\n\"This space once was a place that just really stored things that were unwanted,\" said Johnson. \"To have a transformation of a place where kids can come and dive into the world beyond is pretty meaningful, symbolically and literally.\"\nThe students in attendance for Thursday's ribbon cutting all had perfect attendance.\nIn all, about 90 students received a very special prize from the Big Ten.\n\"We will give tickets for them and their family to attend the game,\" said Big Ten Conference senior vice president Omar Brown. \"To be able to make a big impact in Indianapolis is an amazing feat.\"\nThe CFP Foundation also recognized a teacher at School 106 for her 14 years of service. She received a $1,000 check to help stock her classroom.",
