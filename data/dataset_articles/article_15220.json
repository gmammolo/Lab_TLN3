  "text": "It’s been a successful year for music at the University. As the year comes to a close, student musicians gave thanks for their experiences and artistic endeavors.\nWith various performances held by ensembles within the music department and student-led organizations, UNC’s student musicians cherish their accomplishments this year; some even improved upon their talents without majoring in music.\nMalcolm Douglas, a sophomore studying economics and statistics, plays the mandolin, electric guitar and bass guitar. He shared his experience performing with the Carolina Bluegrass Band, one of UNC’s ensembles.\n“It's a great opportunity to play with other people,” he said. “Which I think as a musician is the best way to grow. And you know, learning from instructors who are experts in specific genres, you pick up a lot about stylistic influences and things that you should be doing.”\nDirected by Tatiana Hargreaves, the band hosted their fall showcase on Nov. 23 in the Moeser Auditorium, displaying the work they put into their skills, Douglas said.\nSophomore biology and music student, Swathi Jayakumar, plays in the piano ensemble at UNC and has been teaching the instrument for seven years.\nIn April, Jayakumar performed with the Kenan Theater Company for their production “Something Rotten,” along with the UNC Pauper Players production “Assassins” in October. She shined light on her experience and how great it felt to play piano for the vocalists starring in these productions.\n“I enjoy the plays,” she said. ”But some of these vocalists you would see that I accompany, they're a real delight to play with. They're so talented, and that's why I enjoy those musicals as well.”\nFor these musicians, playing music and attending college comes with difficulties, but they say they use their craft to decompress while juggling academia.",
