  "text": "Reply To:\nName - Reply Comment\nOfficials of Megakem Engineering and National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority\nMegakem Engineering has taken a pioneering step by signing an agreement with the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) to launch a Certification Programme for the National Trade Test in Waterproofing Technicians.\nThis initiative marks the first time in Sri Lanka that such a certification has been introduced for technicians in the waterproofing industry.The agreement was formalized with the participation of Ruchika Amarasekara, Chairman of NAITA, and Ashoka Siriwardena, Group Chairman of Wardena Venture Holdings, underlining the strategic collaboration between two industry leaders.\nThis certification program aims to uplift the skills and standards of waterproofing technicians in the country, providing them with professional recognition and enhancing their technical expertise. Additionally, Megakem Engineering has ambitious plans to extend this certification to the international level, contributing to the global recognition of Sri Lankan waterproofing community.This groundbreaking initiative is expected to greatly benefit the construction industry by providing certified, skilled technicians who meet national and, in the future, international standards.",
