  "text": "New research from EE has found that almost all parents (96%) of children aged 13 to 16 state their child is online or uses a smartphone, however over three-quarters (79%) are concerned about their children’s online activities.\nThe research revealed a gap in parents’ understanding of the online risks their children face, particularly around creating and sharing content. Worryingly, 62% of parents were unaware of what a digital footprint is, highlighting a lack of awareness about the long-term impact of their children’s online activities.\nWhile much of this content is seen as harmless, the consequences can be serious, ranging from the immediate threats of identity theft and deepfakes through to potential exposure to online predators.\nTwo-fifths (41%) of parents believed that their child does not have full awareness of their digital footprint, and when thinking about it in the wider context of smartphone use, only 8% of parents acknowledged it as a top concern.\nFears around their children seeing inappropriate content (40%) or too much screentime (38%) were seen as much more troubling.\nThe concerns of parents, however, conflict with those of their children, who are more worried about feeling socially excluded from their peers without a phone (71%).\nParents acknowledge their child owning a smartphone keeps them connected with family and friends (59%) and develops their digital skills for the future (31%), but EE said that the lack of understanding around digital footprints could leave children exposed to risk.\nAccording to the mobile operator, the research indicates a clear need for more support for parents to guide their children through the online world, yet few feel adequately educated, with over half (55%) saying they would welcome more reliable, expert-led resources on smartphone usage.\nThe lead up to Christmas means more families are thinking about purchasing devices for their children, with searches for online safety information rising through January and February according to EE.\n“Parents have a tough job navigating online safety with their children and the ever-changing digital space can be overwhelming,” said Hannah Nascimento Garcia, responsible business director at EE.\n“Our research shows that the need for advice around navigating the online world is growing. EE helps provide clear, expert advice and practical tools, supporting parents steer these challenges and promote safer, more responsible digital use for their children.”",
