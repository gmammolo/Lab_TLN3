By Kevin Connaughton and Joshua Hemphill Published: Dec. 5, 2024 at 8:14 AM EST | Updated: 18 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - The University of South Carolina named Jeremiah Donati as its 31st Director of Athletics, President Michael Amiridis announced Thursday afternoon following a meeting of the school’s Board of Trustees.\nThe decision comes months after former AD Ray Tanner stepped down to transition into a new role with the school.\n“I’m honored to join the University of South Carolina, a school with a rich history of athletic excellence and passionate fans,” said Donati. “I look forward to working alongside our exceptional coaches, student-athletes, and staff to continue building on the tremendous success of Gamecock Athletics. Our goal is to be a national leader in both competitive excellence and student-athlete experience. We will compete for championships while ensuring our student-athletes are supported in all aspects of their college careers.”\nDonati became TCU’s Director of Intercollegiate Athletics in 2017 after he arrived at TCU in 2011.\nHe was previously the Horned Frogs’ Deputy Athletics Director before becoming TCU’s eighth Director of Intercollegiate Athletics.\nAccording to Donati’s TCU profile, he played a major role in enhancing the TCU student-athlete experience through donor-supported facility upgrades totaling nearly $500 million.\nThe department’s most recent project, a $50 million renovation and expansion of the Athletics Human Performance Center, was announced in December 2022.\nIn the 2023-24 athletics season, TCU was one of only five schools nationally to win multiple NCAA Championships. In the previous 2022-23 season, TCU became the first school in the College Football Playoff era to reach the CFP, NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament, and College World Series in the same academic year.\nUnder first-year head football coach Sonny Dykes, the Horned Frogs reached the College Football Playoff in 2022, defeating Michigan in the CFP semifinals of the Fiesta Bowl and playing Georgia in the national championship game.\n“I am thrilled to welcome Jeremiah Donati to Gamecock Nation,” said USC President Michael Amiridis. “Jeremiah’s accomplishments at TCU speak for themselves. His leadership will be invaluable as we continue to build on the successes of Gamecock Athletics and ensure that our student-athletes have the support and resources they need to compete at the highest level.”\nFeel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.
