  "text": "South Tahoe High using new monitoring plan to reduce vandalism, vaping, and crowding in restrooms\nSubmitted by\npaulaon Thu, 12/05/2024 - 12:58pmSOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. - After months of trying solutions to end a growing problem in the South Tahoe High School (STHS) restrooms, the school's leadership is taking new steps.\nSince last year, students have been increasingly hanging out in school restrooms, vaping, and causing damage, much of which is part of a TikTok challenge. The challenge has run rampant across the country, causing kids to rob, steal, and damage their school restrooms, and STHS Principal Justin Zunino says it's not going away like some challenges, causing some real health and safety concerns.\nBesides the vandalism, vaping and hanging out in the restrooms are making it uncomfortable for those wanting to use the room as intended.\n\"I’ve been meeting with kids on this issue and discussing ideas/problem-solving since last year with minimal success,\" said Zunino. He says it is a small minority that has been causing the issues, but they affect everyone.\nLast year they tried parent volunteers walking around campus making positive connections and encouraging students to hang out in areas intended for those activities. They've had security guards continually monitoring the restrooms, and constant communication with students. Those didn't help.\nThis year, he has increased those efforts with staff and student leadership teams working on different solutions. The latest plan is creating hope that they are turning the corner on the problem.\nNow, knowing the need to create a safe environment in restrooms, address the vaping that is taking place, and eliminate the destruction, the restrooms are being monitored during breaks and classroom time, and they are only allowing the number of students inside that match the number of stalls. Zunino said the wait time to use restrooms has been reasonable and they are using data to see if adjustments need to be made.\nZunino said he'd been getting \"a ton of emails\" from parents and others stating they appreciate the efforts in restoring the restrooms to their intended use.\n\"Kids are asking less to get out of class to go to the restroom,\" said Zunino. \"It appears we're moving in the right direction in terms of our intent.\"\nThe school will continue to communicate with students and staff over the coming weeks.\nZunino sent out a letter to parents, students, and staff on Thursday:\nGood morning, Viking Community!\nStudents and staff at STHS have become increasingly concerned about the recent incidents of vandalism, overcrowding, and vaping in our school restrooms. At the same time, it’s also important to understand and note that these behaviors do not reflect the values and character of our school.\nWhile rumors have circulated about potential restroom closures and the use of portable toilets, we’ve chosen a more practical solution to address these issues. This week we implemented a plan to more closely monitor restroom usage, which may occasionally require a brief wait but is necessary to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment for all.\nIn this issue and others, we will continue to work together to support school safety and value a common respect for all people and our beautiful STHS campus. Thank you for your continued partnership in fostering a positive school culture at STHS.\nSTHS has what is called a \"Viking Graduate Profile\" that outlines and describes the characteristics of what it means to be a Viking. Zunino said they are reframing the expectations for struggling students to better understand what it means to be a Viking, and they share that with the students.",
