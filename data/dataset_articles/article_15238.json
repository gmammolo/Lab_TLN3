  "text": "Dr. Daniel B. Oerther, an environmental health engineering professor at Missouri S&T, has been awarded the Duncan Fraser Global Award for Excellence in Engineering Education from the International Federation of Engineering Education Societies (IFEES).\n“Professor Fraser was passionate about empowering students through his teaching, and I strive to approach my work with students in the same way,” Oerther says. “Engineering educators carry a great responsibility to train and inspire students from diverse backgrounds so they can address global challenges.\n“I am honored to receive this award, but it’s crucial to recognize this would not be possible without the thousands of incredible students I’ve had the privilege of teaching and mentoring throughout my career.”\nThe International Federation of Engineering Education Societies website notes this honor is for educators “who have made innovative and meritorious contributions with a significant impact on the advancement of engineering education.”\nOerther received the honor during the World Engineering Education Forum in early December in Sydney, Australia. His teenaged son, Barney, joined him at the ceremony.\nThe award is named in memory of Dr. Duncan Fraser, an emeritus professor of chemical engineering at the University of Cape Town in South Africa who was on track to be president of the International Federation of Engineering Education Societies before his passing in 2014.\nOerther was nominated by the American Society for Engineering Education, where he is a two-time recipient of the Best Paper Award from the Environmental Engineering Division and a winner of the Robert G. Quinn Award for excellence in experimentation and laboratory instruction.\nIn a letter supporting the nomination, University of Missouri System President Mun Choi wrote: “Dan is a dynamo. He looks over the horizon for future opportunities in research and he brings these opportunities to his students to find solutions in the classroom, the laboratory, and beyond the institution embedded in the community.”\nA Missouri S&T faculty member since 2010, Oerther has earned several S&T awards for teaching, including the 2023 Faculty Teaching Award, the 2022 Outstanding Teaching Award, the 2022 Experiential Learning Award, and the 2017 Service Learning Award.\nSome of his other teaching-focused awards include the 2023 Joe Beck Educational Contribution Award from the National Environmental Health Association, the 2020 Gordon Maskew Fair Distinguished Engineering Educator Medal from the Water Environment Federation, the 2019 Engineering Education Excellence Award from the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the 2014 Excellence in Environmental Engineering Education Award from the American Academy of Environmental Engineers.\nOerther earned a Ph.D. and master’s degree in environmental engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, as well as bachelor’s degrees in both environmental engineering and biology from Northwestern University.\nHe is a Fellow of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, the Society of Environmental Engineers, the Society of Operations Engineers, the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health, and the Royal Society for Public Health, among other organizations.\nFinancial support for the Fraser Award, including roundtrip travel to Australia, lodging, and a $1,000 cash prize were provided through sponsorships by MathWorks and ABET, Inc. ABET was formerly known as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology and is a non-governmental accreditation organization for college programs.\nFor more information about Missouri S&T’s environmental engineering program, visit care.mst.edu.\nMissouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) is a STEM-focused research university of over 7,000 students located in Rolla, Missouri. Part of the four-campus University of Missouri System, Missouri S&T offers over 100 degrees in 40 areas of study and is among the nation’s top public universities for salary impact, according to the Wall Street Journal.
