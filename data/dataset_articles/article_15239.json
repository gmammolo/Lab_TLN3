  "text": "When the University of Wisconsin-Superior’s Music Department debuts its 27th annual Season of Song concerts on Sunday, December 8, at Cathedral of Crist the King in Superior, it will represent the culmination of 100 hours of preparation for students and faculty alike.\n“The theme this year is ‘Love’s Pure Light’ and features sacred and secular music celebrating the holiday season and the importance of choosing love in our increasingly divided world,” said Michael Fuchs , D.M.A., UW-Superior director of choral activities, associate professor and chair of the Music Department.\nPreparation for the two Season of Song concerts includes nearly 30 rehearsals.\n“We have been working on Season of Song music during choir rehearsals consistently for the past couple of months,” said Emma Jones, a senior flute music performance major at UW-Superior. “However, as the concert approaches, we have had extra rehearsals.”\nThe concert itself includes 25 instrumentalists, 35 vocalists and singers, and nine UW-Superior Music Department faculty members. Jones will be performing in Season of Song both as an alto in the choir and playing flute with the orchestra.\n“I am most excited to be able to share the music,” said Jones. “We are playing and singing some very meaningful music, and I am eager to be able to give that to others.”\n The depth and variety of music has helped the Season of Song concert series to grow.\n“This concert has been growing in popularity over the years,” said Fuchs. “Last year we had record turnout of over 700 people over the two concert dates and also another 200 student athletes at our dress rehearsal.”\nFor Gage Schmidgall, a freshman at UW-Superior from Hancock, Minnesota, who will be performing in the choir, Season of Song brings both excitement and uncertainty.\n“This is my first Season of Song concerts, so I have no idea what to expect beyond what we have practiced,” said Schmidgall, a history/social studies – 4-12 education major. “The build up for Season of Song has been fun, and I am probably the most excited to hear all of the music in the cathedral. I hope the audience enjoys this concert as much or more than I do.”\nThis cherished Twin Ports holiday tradition will feature the UW-Superior choirs and orchestra performing holiday classics, new favorites and everything in between. The 75-minute performances will include a variety of choral, orchestral and organ music, along with holiday favorites such as “O Holy Night,” “The First Noel” and newer choral pieces.\n“Everything that contributes to the Season of Song concerts is very intentional,” said Jones. “Dr. Fuchs does a wonderful job of selecting the music and organizing the program in a way that makes the concert enjoyable, memorable and meaningful.”\nPerformances for Season of Song concerts will take place Sunday, December 8, at 4 p.m. and Tuesday, December 10, at 7:30 p.m. at Cathedral of Christ the King in Superior. Tickets are $10 and can be purchased at the door. Cathedral of Christ the King is located at 1111 Belknap St., in Superior.",
