  "text": "DIFE Student of the Year Awards recognise path of graduates\nThis year the Drogheda Institute of Further Education (DIFE) Student of the Year Awards ceremony took place on Friday, November 29.\nThis prestigious ceremony celebrates the contributions and extraordinary paths of graduates, through the presentation of a Student of the Year award to a selection of outstanding students from the 2024 cohort.\nThe event was attended by a host of local dignitaries from the world of education, industry and politics. Over 45 learners were awarded in this year’s ceremony with certificates and trophies presented by the Mayor of Drogheda, Paddy McQuillan to the graduates from a variety of courses.\nThe keynote speakers at the event, were Dáire Keogh, President, Dublin City University and Martin O’Brien, CE of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board (LMETB) who paid tribute to the fantastic success of the graduates and their achievements in their studies in DIFE.\nThe awards ceremony also saw twelve graduates of the Data Centre Technician Programme in collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) included in the ceremony for the conferring of their academic programme. These awards were introduced by Joanne Reynolds, (AWS) with John Kelly (AWS) presenting the overall award for the AWS Student of the Year. This was a momentous occasion with both representatives from DIFE and AWS acknowledging the remarkable success and incredible achievements of learners throughout the programme.\nJoanne Reynolds, Community Engagement Manager, said: “We are thrilled to see the third cohort of learners graduating from this programme, which exemplifies what’s possible when industry and academia join forces. Many of the students are career changers returning to education and have successfully combined studies with their busy lives. We are immensely proud of their dedication, work ethic during internships, and success in forging new careers. We are also grateful to DIFE for their collaboration in supporting students through this life-changing journey.”\nAlso graduating on the day was a cohort of Pharmacy Technician graduates who were awarded a Pearson-BTEC Diploma presented by Sadie Ward McDermont Director of Further Education and Training in LMETB.\nAbi McCormack, Pre-University Nursing graduate won the Oliver Tully overall student of the year award, presented by Dáire Keogh, DCU. Abi encapsulated all the qualities of an exemplary student and was recognised by both her peers and teaching staff in the college for consistently demonstrating academic excellence, compassionate care and overall professionalism within her studies.\nAbi excelled in a clinical setting completing a successful work experience placement at St Mary’s Nursing Home in Drogheda. Abi was successful in gaining one of the 12 reserved Nursing placed in DCU for DIFE graduates and is currently studying the General Nursing integrated with Children’s Nursing degree programme.\nFinbar Murphy from Drogheda Credit Union presented The Outstanding Service to the College Community Award to Jonathan Balfe graduate of Applied Social Studies. The award was presented as an acknowledgement of Jonathan’s contribution to the college community and his outstanding achievements in collaboration, collegiality, and support to other learners.\nAfter making the difficult decision to return to education after spending two decades working in Human Resources, Jonathan showed incredible commitment and dedication to all aspects of college life in DIFE. Jonathan’s enthusiasm in the classroom was palpable, as was his pride in being a student and he completed an exceptional work placement at the Connect Family Resource Centre in Drogheda. Jonathan successfully graduated with Distinction and has progressed to a Level 8 Social Studies degree programme in Trinity College, Dublin.\nAdditionally, Joe Thomas, partner at O’Reilly Thomas Solicitors presented a bursary award to Pre-University Law and Criminology graduate Rhys Cummins who excelled within his studies in Law and Criminology and has subsequently progressed to a Bachelor of Civil Law (Law and Society) degree programme in DCU.\nDIFE Principal Davy McDonnell congratulated all the graduates present on their achievements and wished the overall class of 2024 every success in their future endeavors.\nApplications for full time courses commencing in September 2025 in Drogheda Institute are now open.
