  "text": "Xavier University of Louisiana is making history with the launch of its Master of Science in Genetic Counseling program, marking a significant milestone as the first accredited program of its kind in Louisiana. This initiative reinforces the university’s longstanding commitment to transforming healthcare practices.\nReynold Verret, president of Xavier University , emphasized the importance of this program in continuing the institution’s legacy of promoting diversity and equity within the healthcare sector. “This program is another way we stay true to our mission of creating a more just and humane society.,” said Verret.\nThe new Genetic Counseling program aims to train students in clinical skills and ethical practices emphasizing compassion and cultural sensitivity. Students will learn to guide families in understanding the implications of genetic conditions through a cutting-edge curriculum that integrates the latest advancements in genetic counseling techniques. Accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling, this program aims to address health disparities by helping individuals and communities navigate their genetic health challenges.\nDiversifying the Field Alix D’Angelo, assistant program director and clinical assistant professor, highlighted the urgent need for diverse representation within the field. “There’s a minimal number of genetic counselors from minority populations to serve as clinical supervisors, program faculty, and leadership,” D’Angelo stated. “Being one of the only accredited genetic counseling programs at a historically Black college and university is meaningful.”\nThe program, which is supported by Myriad Genetics and collaborated with Ochsner Health, aims to enhance diversity within the genetic counseling profession while promoting equitable healthcare access across Louisiana.\nDr. Leonardo Seoane, founding dean of the Xavier Ochsner College of Medicine, expressed enthusiasm for the new partnership. “What we were missing in Louisiana is that we do not have a genetic counseling program. The [Ochsner Health] partnership with Xavier to start the first genetic counseling program in Louisiana is very exciting,” he said.\nThe Genetic Counseling program seeks to cultivate skilled professionals and empower students to advocate for underserved communities. The university aspires to equip future counselors with the tools to effectively support their patients in navigating complex health landscapes, ultimately improving health outcomes.",
