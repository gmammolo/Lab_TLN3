  "text": "West Virginia State University is excited to introduce a transformative scholarship program for its elementary education majors, thanks to the generous support of the John and Ruth McGee Foundation. Over the next five years, the foundation will provide $500,000 , $100,000 each year, to support high-need students pursuing careers in public education.\nDr Kerri Steele is the College of Professional Studies dean at WVSU. She emphasized the profound impact this scholarship can have on students’ educational journeys. “The McGee Foundation Scholarship will be life-changing for the students who receive it,” she stated.\n“Most of our students juggle their studies with the need to work, but as they advance in the program, this becomes more challenging. They face competency exams at key milestones, rigorous experiential learning requirements, and ultimately, full-time residency placement in their final year. The McGee Foundation Scholarship is designed to provide increased support as students progress in their studies, freeing them from financial concerns so that they can focus fully on preparing to become the qualified, dedicated teachers our West Virginia children depend on.”\nThe scholarship is targeted specifically at high-need individuals from West Virginia. Scholarships will be allocated based on demonstrated financial need after all federal and state aid options have been exhausted. The funds can be utilized to cover tuition costs, praxis exam fees, and other necessary expenses related to obtaining an elementary education degree and teaching licensure.\nPreference will be given to scholarship applicants who express a commitment to teaching in West Virginia upon graduation. The first round of scholarships will be awarded starting in the fall semester of 2025.\nWVSU boasts a well-respected teacher education program that has been continuously accredited since 1963. In recent years, the university has successfully placed 51 graduates into public school teaching roles across 14 counties in West Virginia.",
