It commits all educational, research and engagement endeavours to support flourishing communities and the pursuit of an ethical future.\nProfessor Skrbis has also driven a model of financial resilience, overseen the highest domestic and international student loads in ACU’s history and the establishment of ACU Online campus, enabling learning opportunities to an increasingly diverse population of students.\nUnder Professor Skrbis’ leadership, the university has established a Graduate Research School and refined its research focus to align with Vision 2033, while strengthening research collaboration between faculties and institutes.\nProfessor Skrbis said he was honoured to be reappointed as Vice-Chancellor and he thanked the members of the Senate for their support.\n“My vision for the next five years is for ACU to continue to be a university where academic excellence, human-centred research and a commitment to our Catholic Mission come together to transform lives and society.”\nFULL STORY\nProfessor Zlatko Skrbis reappointed as ACU Vice-Chancellor (ACU)",
