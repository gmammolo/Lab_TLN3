  "text": "Mount Union Announces Nearly 10% Tuition Reduction for Doctor of Physical Therapy Program, Strengthening Accessibility for Aspiring Physical Therapists\nDecember 05, 2024ALLIANCE, Ohio—The University of Mount Union is pleased to announce a strategic tuition adjustment for its [Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program](/academics/graduate-degrees/physical-therapy). The adjustment reflects the institution's commitment to making a high-quality education more accessible to students interested in a career in physical therapy.\nBeginning in August, tuition for the 2025 DPT program cohort will decrease by 9%, bringing the cost to $12,650 per 15-week term. This reduction in tuition also strengthens Mount Union’s established position in high-demand healthcare-related fields.\n\"Our decision to lower tuition underscores our dedication to affordability while further strengthening our competitive edge in the market. We recognize that the true worth of our students’ DPT education is marked, in the end, by their personal and professional success as a physical therapist,\" said [Dr. Sheryl Holt](/dr-sheryl-holt), director of the Mount Union DPT program. \"Our faculty and staff are committed to ensuring that our students are met with exceptional educational opportunities and needed support every step of the way.”\nUnderstanding the increased need for skilled healthcare professionals, this tuition reduction allows Mount Union’s DPT program to be within reach of students of all backgrounds while continuing to uphold the highest standards of excellence in preparing the next generation of PTs. In 2023, the program celebrated a 100% graduation rate and achieved a 100% ultimate pass rate on the National Physical Therapy Examination (NPTE), further affirming its position as a leader in physical therapy education.\n“The University understands affordability is top of mind. We are committed to making the degree in the DPT program more attainable and ensure that graduates remain well-prepared to excel in their careers,” said Dr. Bryan Boatright, dean of graduate, digital, continued learning and associate VPAA. “Its faculty, curriculum, and resources remain as robust and vibrant as ever, equipping students with the skills and knowledge to succeed in a dynamic healthcare landscape.”\nLearn more about Mount Union’s Doctor of Physical Therapy program by visiting [mountunion.edu/dpt](/academics/graduate-degrees/physical-therapy).",
