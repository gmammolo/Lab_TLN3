  "text": "**PLEASE NOTE: Vision and images of the attestation will be made available after the parade on Friday 6 December 2024\nNSW Police welcomes the biggest class in a decade as 298 new probationary constables from Class 364 attest at the NSW Police Academy today (Friday 6 December 2024).\nHer Excellency, The Honourable Margaret Beazley AC KC, Governor of New South Wales, Minister for Police and Counter-terrorism, the Honourable Yasmin Catley MP, will join NSW Police Commissioner, Karen Webb APM at the Goulburn Police Academy.\nOn Monday 9 December 2024, the probationary constables will be deployed to police stations across the state for their first day on the job, serving their local communities.\nMinister for Police and Counter-terrorism, Yasmin Catley, said this is a monumental day for the NSW Police.\n\"Class 364 is the largest attesting class in a decade – overwhelming evidence the tide is turning on recruitment. Next year is set to be even bigger, with more than 1,000 recruits attesting.\n\"The NSW Government backs our police to the hilt. We are focused on retaining experienced officers and recruiting new ones which is why we've secured a historic pay deal, we're paying recruits to train and offering recruits from the bush a pathway to work in or near their hometown after attesting.\n\"Congratulations to Class 364. Today marks the start of what I hope is a long, rich and rewarding career with the NSW Police Force.\"\nNSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb APM said today was a huge milestone for the recruits who should be proud of their hard work over the past eight months.\n\"I want to congratulate our newest 298 probationary constables, who have shown they have the resilience and determination required to succeed in the NSW Police Force,\" Commissioner Webb said.\n\"They have proven themselves physically and academically to reach this point and from Monday they will experience the incredible reward of serving the community as a police officer.\n\"Every day for the next 12 months will bring both new challenges and rewards, and I take this opportunity to remind them that they are not alone, and their blue family will be here to support them every step of the way,\" Commissioner Webb said.\nCommissioner Webb said today's attestation marked a turning point for the organisation.\n\"I am overjoyed at the size of Class 364 and congratulate not only our newest troops, but those within the organisation who made today happen,\" Commissioner Webb said.\n\"Recruitment has been a key focus of my team and seeing the biggest class in 10 years graduate from the Academy is a major achievement in rebuilding our organisation.\n\"Not only that, our application numbers continue to rise, and I look forward to the even bigger classes set to graduate in 2025.\"\nFACTS AND FIGURES ABOUT CLASS 364\nA total of 298 recruits are being sworn in today.\nThe class comprises 218 men and 80 women.\nThe students will attest with the rank of probationary constable.

The officers will then be confirmed to the rank of constable.\nWhile many recruits are Australian-born, this year the graduating cohort is also made up of students from diverse backgrounds.\n24 recruits are indigenous.\n256 were born in Australia and 42 were born overseas.
