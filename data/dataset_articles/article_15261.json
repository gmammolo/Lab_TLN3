  "text": "Pearl Academy, established 1993, a leading creative education institution, hosted the prestigious International Foundation of Fashion Technology Institutes (IFFTI) India Chapter Inaugural Roundtable on December 4, 2024 at its Delhi-West campus. With a proud legacy of over 32 years in design education, Pearl Academy continues to lead the way as the only Indian institution to be the Executive Council member of IFFTI, further solidifying its role as a global leader in shaping the future of design education.\nThe IFFTI India Chapter aimed to unite India’s top design institutions to build a collaborative network that aligns academic and industry efforts toward creating impactful, future-ready solutions. Fashion institutions like NIFT, UID, IIAD, and others were also represented, alongside attendees from top Delhi schools, colleges, and other prominent bodies. An exceptional lineup of distinguished guests, included esteemed representatives from the New Zealand Embassy, senior members from organisations such as FDCI, ADI, Fashion Revolution, and industry leaders.\nThe roundtable aligned with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, emphasising sustainability, digital innovation, and skills development as key drivers for India’s future. As India continues to position itself at the forefront of global design, the discussions underscored the importance of adapting education to the ever-evolving industry demands. A major outcome of the roundtable was the creation of the IFFTI India Chapter Manifesto, which sets forth a strategic vision for the future of design education. Members agreed to collaborate on digital innovation, sustainability, and skill development, focusing on Indian heritage. India, with its rich and vast history of textiles, aims to align its heritage, art, and culture with these key areas on a global platform. The goal is to showcase India’s rich legacy while driving innovation in design, sustainability, and skill development, ensuring its prominence on the world stage. This landmark event also laid the foundation for the IFFTI Conference 2027 in India, which will be hosted by Pearl Academy.\nSpeaking on the significance of the event, Aditi Srivastava, President, Pearl Academy, said, “This event marks a key milestone in advancing design education in India. As leaders of the IFFTI India Chapter, we are committed to shaping the next generation of creative professionals, equipping them with the skills to thrive in a rapidly changing global landscape. By collaborating with academic institutions, industry leaders, and cultural ambassadors, we aim to showcase India’s rich heritage on a global platform. Through our focus on digital innovation, sustainability, and skill development, we seek to position India as a hub for sustainable and innovative design education. The IFFTI Conference in 2027 will offer a significant opportunity to further strengthen India’s role in the global design dialogue, bridging tradition with modernity, preserving culture, and enhancing skills across the design community.”",
