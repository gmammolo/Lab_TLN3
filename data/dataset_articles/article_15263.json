  "text": "Northern Marianas College 2024 nursing graduate Yi Huang Jenkins has joined the long list of NMC students who have passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses or NCLEX-RN.\nNursing graduates must pass the NCLEX-RN to be able to practice nursing as a Registered Nurse. The exam tests nursing graduates’ knowledge, skills, and abilities to certify that they can apply entry-level nursing practices correctly.\n“The college is always incredibly proud to see more NMC nursing graduates pass this exam,” said NMC president Dr. Galvin Deleon Guerrero. “Congratulations to Yi Huang on successfully passing the NCLEX-RN.”\n“We are so proud of Yi for passing the NCLEX-RN,” said Nursing Department chair Rosa T. Aldan. “The Nursing Team is excited for her to begin her career as a registered nurse, joining her peers at the bedside.”\nJenkins, who graduated from NMC this spring, chose the nursing field for the abundance of opportunities and aspirations she finds in the industry despite its challenges. She attributes much of her determination to her faith. “My motivation for pursuing nursing is to glorify the Lord by caring for more people in need,” she said.\nWhen studying for the NCLEX, Jenkins emphasized the importance of time management and effort, stating that they are directly proportional to rewards.\n“I believe God wants me to become a safe, responsible, and caring nurse,” Jenkins said. “When I was preparing for NCLEX, I studied almost every day from morning to night. This is very difficult because it requires a lot of self-control, patience, and persistence.”\nAkin to her motivation for pursuing her nursing degree with NMC, she stated that her faith was a significant factor in her drive toward obtaining her nursing certification.\nAlong with the help of the weekly Kaplan sessions, Jenkins highlighted the importance of her NMC nursing instructors, stating that her success is inseparable from their guidance.\nShe personally credited her skills to her instructors, “I learned how important it is to prioritize my studies through the Nursing Department chair, Mrs. Rosa Aldan. I learned nursing knowledge and gained continuous valuable support from Mr. Johnny Aldan. I learned essential clinical nursing skills from Mrs. Breanna. I learned strict sterile procedures and practical nursing care from Mrs. Tasha. I expanded my knowledge on pediatric care from Dr. Lee. I am also thankful to the administrative assistant, Andrew, for always being there and supporting us whenever we need help.”\nHer advice to NMC students who are planning to take the NCLEX, Jenkins encouraged the prioritization of studying and effort, along with the usage of faith as a form of support. “Study not only to pass the exam, but also to develop safer clinical skills and practices as a nurse soon,” she advised.\nJenkins is currently in New Hampshire and looking forward to working in different nursing fields, gaining abundant experiences in local hospitals, and contributing to society.
