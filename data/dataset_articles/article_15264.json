  "text": "WOODINVILLE, Wash. — Eight students in Washington State University’s [Department of Viticulture and Enology](https://wine.wsu.edu/) (V&E) recently traveled from the Tri-Cities campus west across the Cascades to witness Woodinville’s flourishing wine scene.\nOpen to all viticulture and enology majors, the daylong expedition was a part of VE Connects, an initiative established by V&E Department Chair Jean Dodson Peterson and funded via the [V&E Experiential Learning Fund](https://foundation.wsu.edu/give/?fund=fb7ed1e1-30d5-4722-8266-e38d0266f98c&cat=idonate_colleges&area=idonate_agricultural_human_and_natural_resource_sciences&utm_source=Viticulture+%26+Enology&utm_medium=qr-code&utm_campaign=viticulture-enology-experiential-learning-fund-print-materials). The group’s itinerary included four stops that showcased different aspects of the region’s wine industry.\n“It was a fantastic day,” said Dodson Peterson, who led the field trip. “VE Connects is designed to foster a strong sense of community among our students while building meaningful connections between academia and the wine industry. While much of Washington’s grape production takes place on the east side of the state, this experience highlighted the thriving wine production and industry presence in western Washington.”\nLocated 25 miles north of Seattle and boasting more than 130 wineries, Woodinville has evolved into an industry mecca of sorts. For WSU transfer student Paul Cramer, the visit provided an eye-opening look at what goes on behind the scenes.\n“The trip was an exploration and extension of what we’re doing in class,” Cramer said. “It showed us the wine industry’s many specialties and demonstrated that this field has opportunities for thinking outside the box. It was refreshing to see how many chances there are to carve your own path.”\nThe students started the day by meeting Erica Orr, owner of an independent winemaking, consulting, and enology business.\n“We invited Erica because of her unique and innovative role in the industry,” Dodson Peterson said. “It’s inspiring for students to see someone who has built a successful career by pursuing a less traditional path.”\nThe group then toured a more traditional winery setting at Novelty Hill and Januik, two wineries that share a tasting room and winemaking space. Both also employ many WSU graduates.\n“We wanted to showcase Januik’s longstanding and deep-rooted connections within the industry,” Dodson Peterson said. “Their experience offers a valuable long-term perspective on the remarkable growth of Washington’s wine industry.”\nThe third stop was DeLille Cellars, a creator of Bordeaux-style blends that was founded in 1992.\n“We had a great discussion at DeLille,” Dodson Peterson said. “They shared insights into how they’ve designed their cellar to prioritize and support sustainable operations.”\nThe group wrapped up the day at Sparkman Cellars, where students had a chance to smell and taste some of the winery’s yeast trials and hear about other in-progress experiments.\n“Innovation is key to staying competitive in this industry, and effectively communicating those advancements to consumers is essential for long-term success,” Dodson Peterson said.\nFor Cramer, the trip illustrated how wine industry members in Woodinville consistently work together and support one another.\n“I was fascinated by the palpable sense of community that exists between these winemakers,” he said. “Instead of being competitive, they’re fortifying what’s existing and ensuring there’s a foundation for the industry going forward.”\nIn addition to providing a unique opportunity to learn outside the classroom, Cramer believes the Woodinville trip will help him prepare for a successful career in the wine industry.\n“As we visited the different venues, I found myself constantly attaching my wine science education to the hands-on perspective I was seeing,” he said. “The biggest thing I walked away with is the realization that I’ll have the confidence to say, ‘yes, I can do that,’ in any future job interview.”\nFuture VE Connects Trips:\nStudents will visit Red Mountain AVA and Walla Walla Valley AVA in spring 2025. More information to come.\nTravel expenses for this trip were made possible in part by donated funds.
