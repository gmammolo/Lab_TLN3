  "text": "The Minnesota high school state softball championship games are coming to the University of Minnesota campus.\nA move many have suggested for years now, the Minnesota State High School League Board of Directors approved the change in location at its meeting on Thursday.\nPreviously, the entire state tournament was held at Caswell Park in North Mankato. That will continue to be the site for all quarterfinals, semifinals, third-place and consolation games, with only the championship bouts moving to Jane Sage Cowles Stadium on June 6.\nThe new setup will place a greater spotlight on each championship game. In past years, all four title games were run at adjacent fields concurrently, with slightly staggered start times. Now, each title game will be the main event of its time slot, as is the case in all other sports.\nThe MSHSL polled coaches across the state about the potential move, and reported that “approximately 70 percent of respondents” supported the change.\nAdditionally, the Board approved the date and location of the first-ever League-sanctioned boys state volleyball tournament, which is set for June 10-12 at the University of St. Thomas.",
