  "text": "CBSE to Introduce Standard and Basic Levels for Class 9, 10 exams: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning to introduce two levels of Science and Social Science for students of Classes 9 and 10, starting from the academic session 2026-27. This proposal is inspired by the successful implementation of two levels of Mathematics—standard and basic—for Class 10 students in the 2019-20 session. The latest meeting of the CBSE curriculum committee suggested providing Science and Social Science at two different levels for Classes 9 and 10. Nevertheless, the ultimate endorsement for this initiative rests with the Board's governing body, which is its supreme decision-making authority.\nThe specifics of the framework, including whether students choosing the advanced level will have unique study resources or just take an alternative exam, have not been confirmed yet. Reports suggest that CBSE is anticipating the launch of new NCERT textbooks, which will conform to the revised National Curriculum Framework, to design the framework for this alteration.\nThe main goal of implementing Science and Social Science at two levels is to enable students who have a keen interest in these subjects to pursue them at a higher level, laying the groundwork for further education in Class 11 and afterwards. As per sources, students are expected to have a designated time limit to choose between the standard or advanced level, along with the option to change levels during that time.\nThis proposal has been formulated as per the new National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which highlights the importance of removing academic stress and limiting the increasing reliance on external coaching. The NEP promotes providing subjects and evaluations at various levels, allowing students to select between standard and advanced choices according to their skills and preferences.",
