  "text": "For Release Upon Receipt - December 5, 2024\nSt. Augustine\nST. AUGUSTINE, Trinidad and Tobago. December 5, 2024 – The Government of France has named Professor Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw, Dean in the Faculty of Humanities and Education at The University of the West Indies (UWI), St. Augustine campus, Officier of the Ordre des Palmes Académiques (Order of Academic Palms). The French Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago hosted a ceremony to recognise her outstanding contribution to scholarship and instruction in French literature and culture.\nThe Academic Palms is the oldest non-military French decoration, an Order of Chivalry of France for academics and cultural and educational figures, founded by Emperor Napoleon I as an honorary title to recognise distinguished members of the University of Paris in 1808. In 1866, under Napoléon III, the scope was broadened to include non-teaching persons who had rendered illustrious service to French national education and culture and non-French citizens and French expatriates who actively expand French education and culture throughout the world.\nThe American Society of the French Academic Palms (ASFAP) states that “by decree of Président René Coty, the Order of the Academic Palms was instituted as the first of ministerial orders recognised by the French Republic and was defined by three ranks: Chevalier (Knight – silver medallion worn on a necklet on left breast), Officier (Officer – golden medallion worn on a ribbon with rosette on left breast) and Commandeur (Commander – golden medallion worn on a ribbon with rosette on left breast)” (ASFAP, 2023).\nAbout The University of the West Indies\nThe University of the West Indies (The UWI) is the Caribbean’s premier, higher education institution. One of only two regional universities in the world, it comprises five campuses across the English-speaking Caribbean and global centres in partnership with universities in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. The UWI has been consistently ranked among the best in the world by the most reputable ranking agency, [Times Higher Education (THE).](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-west-indies)\nLearn more at [www.uwi.edu](http://www.uwi.edu)\nWorks Cited:\nAmerican Society of the French Academic Palms. “About ASFAP.” ASFAP, 2023, [www.frenchacademicpalms.org/about.
