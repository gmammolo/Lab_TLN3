  "text": "LATTC Kicks Off 100th Anniversary Celebration\nOn December 5, 2024, LATTC announced the launch of the Foundations' 100th Anniversary celebration campaign: “100 Years of Student Success and Pathways.” To honor LATTC’s founding year, 1925, the LATTC Foundation and the Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges will collaborate to award at least $192,500 in scholarships and other grants to LATTC students in the coming year.\n“The LATTC Foundation is thrilled to celebrate the college’s centennial to build unity, inclusiveness and achievement for all students, inspiring a new era of visibility and pride for the next 100 years,” says Bonnie Tseng, LATTC Foundation Board Co-Chair. “We are inspired by the dedication of our students and the 100th anniversary initiatives reflect the Foundation’s ongoing commitment to bringing the community together to support our students’ journey.”\nIn addition to student scholarships, the college will honor its 100th anniversary with a year-long series of celebrations, including an [alumni mixer and basketball game event](https://www.lattc.edu/campus-life/events/2025/2/5/celebrating-100-years-alumni-mixer-basketball-game-event) on February 5, 2025, which will highlight alumni success stories and strengthen connections with former students. Later in the evening, guests are invited to show their Beaver pride and stay on to support the college’s women’s and men’s basketball teams who will face off in home games against Rio Hondo College. Additional events will be announced soon.\nThis week, the college also rolled out 100th anniversary commemorative merchandise, which is available both in-store and online via the [College Store website](https://www.lattcbookstore.com/shop_product_list.asp?catalog_group_id=MQ&catalog_group_name=R2VuZXJhbCBNZXJjaGFuZGlzZQ&catalog_id=92&catalog_name=TEFUVEMgMTAwIFllYXJzIEFubml2ZXJzYXJ5).\n“Our 100th anniversary is a milestone achievement that serves not only as a reflection of our college history but a renewed promise to empower future generations through innovation, opportunity, and excellence,” says Dr. Alfred McQuarters, President of LATTC. “We’re thrilled to announce new scholarship opportunities and a series of special events that will empower the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and innovators. Together, we will continue to build on a legacy that has shaped countless lives over the past 100 years, ensuring that the next century is one of even greater achievement and impact.”\nThose who wish to donate to the 100 Years of Student Success and Pathways campaign may do so via the [LATTC Foundation Centennial website](https://lattcfoundation.nationbuilder.com/lattcfoundation100).\nLATTC alumni who wish to reconnect with the college are encouraged to visit the [LATTC alumni webpage](https://www.lattc.edu/about/community/alumni).",
