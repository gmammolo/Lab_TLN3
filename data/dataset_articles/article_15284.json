  "text": "Tom McGurk Cherry Hill Courier-Post Three South Jersey coaches will be a part of the Class of 2024 inducted into the New Jersey State Coaches Association Hall of Fame in January.\nFormer Washington Township boys soccer coach Shane Snyder, along with former Holy Cross/Burlington Township football coach Tom Maderia and current Burlington Township football coach Steve Everette, are the local honorees.\nThe three will join Eileen Allan (Pompton Lakes), Vicki Allison (Mountain Lakes/Morris Knolls), Robert Bechtloff (Central), Robert Buccino (Pascack Hills), Miguel Cabrita (St. Joseph Metuchen), Ken Cieslak (Teaneck/Palisades Park), Bill Clifton (Middletown South/Kearny), Chad Griffiths (Ridge), Roy Hamblen (West Morris Mendham), Drew Morano (Union City), Robert Nucci (Raritan), Jim Shlentz (Colts Neck/St. John Vianney), Bruce Shatel (Roxbury/Delbarton) and Dave Van Hook (Ramapo) in the Class of 2024.\nThe annual induction banquet will be held on Jan. 12 at the Pines Manor in Edison. Tickets for the NJSCA banquet can be purchased through the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association website . Deadline is Dec. 31.\nSnyder guided Washington Township for 14 years, compiling a 241-52-19 career record with three state Group 4 titles and seven sectional banners – championships never achieved by the Minutemen before Snyder took over the program. The Minutemen also won eight conference titles and three Coaches Tournament championships.\nPrior to taking over the boys’ program, Snyder led the Washington Township girls’ program, leading the Minutemaids to a 91-40-7 mark in six seasons.\nSynder remains a special education teacher at Washington Township.\nMaderia coached high school football for 32 years in South Jersey. He led Holy Cross for 11 seasons, guiding the Lancers to a 90-28 record with two state championships.\nMaderia spent 21 seasons at Burlington Township before stepping down in 2023. The Falcons compiled a 131-82 mark at BT, qualifying for the postseason 18 times including a berth in the South Jersey Group 3 final in 2018.\nThis fall, Maderia helped his son, TJ, who is the head coach at Holy Cross Prep Academy.\nEverette replaced Maderia at Burlington Township this season, leading the Falcons to an 8-2 record and a playoff appearance. He is a special education and social studies teacher at Burlington Township.\nPrior to that, Everette coached at his alma mater, Willingboro, where he led the Chimeras to three sectional titles and a regional crown before stepping down after the 2023 season. In 2019, Willingboro went 12-1 with sectional and regional titles after earning consecutive Central Jersey Group 2 titles the previous two seasons.\nAfter earning assistant coaching jobs at Cinnaminson and Oakcrest, Everette had two previous head coaching gigs at Clayton and Princeton. He also was the defensive coordinator for the lightweight football team at Princeton University for four years.\nTom McGurk is a regional sports editor for the Courier-Post, The Daily Journal and Burlington County Times, covering South Jersey sports for over 35 years.
