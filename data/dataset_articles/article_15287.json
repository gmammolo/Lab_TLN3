  "text": "Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Conference returns for 9th year\nUC Davis faculty and instructors share research and discoveries to improve teaching and learning at the ninth [Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (or SoTL) Conference ](https://sotl.ucdavis.edu/)in the ARC Ballroom Dec. 10.\nThe committee planned the 2024 conference around the theme, “The SoTL Cycle: Innovate, Assess, Evolve,” which is dedicated to the celebration of the UC Davis community of educators.\nThe Scholarship of Teaching and Learning works to advance learning and teaching practices through research discourse amongst the education community.\n“The conference provides an opportunity to share research, ideas, practices and resources for evidence-supported teaching innovation at our university,” said [Kem Saichaie](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/people/kem-saichaie), executive director of the Center for Educational Effectiveness. “The [agenda](https://sotl.ucdavis.edu/2024-agenda) offers timely and useful information. There is a panel discussion on the use of AI in teaching and learning, and more than 30 posters presentations.”\nMichigan State University Lappan-Phillips Endowed Professor and National Academy of Education member Melaine Cooper is this year’s keynote speaker. Her address, “[Transforming Education Using Theory and Evidence: Lessons from STEM Learning](https://www.chemistry.msu.edu/_assets/_files/faculty/pdfs/cooper.pdf),” kicks off the conference. Cooper is considered a trailblazer in chemistry education for her work focused on enhancing teaching and learning within large-enrollment general and organic chemistry courses through evidence-based curriculum reform.\nWalk-ins are welcome day of the conference.\nThe [Center for Educational Effectiveness](https://cee.ucdavis.edu/), a unit of the [Office of Undergraduate Education](https://ue.ucdavis.edu/), supports UC Davis faculty and instructors through a wide range of trainings, tools and resources. The center supports the SoTL faculty committee with planning the annual full-day event.",
