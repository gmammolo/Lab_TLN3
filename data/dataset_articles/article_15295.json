After completing her first post-doctoral training she joined AO Research Institute Davos in 2000. She has since then acquired extensive research expertise in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine with focus on articular cartilage and intervertebral disc repair and regeneration. In 2018, she obtained her habilitation in Biomedical Engineering from the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich.\nThe newly appointed Prof Grad said: “I’m very honored to receive this professorship. It is an important recognition of my contributions to research and education at a translational academic level. It is also a great motivation for me to continue teaching at ETH and to continue with my translational research activities at ARI. This is a big step for me because it means better integration in the Department of Health Sciences and Technology, closer collaborations with the professors of the department, better visibility, and better access to the facilities of ETH. I want to thank my colleagues at ARI, especially Geoff Richards, Mauro Alini, and Martin Stoddart, for their support, and I would like to thank my mentor at ETH, Prof Viola Vogel, and all professors at the Institute for Biomechanics for the long-lasting collaborations. I am very much looking forward to this new role.”\n[Sibylle Grad](https://www.aofoundation.org/who-we-are/about-ao/news/2021/access_role-modelling_sibylle_grad), currently a Private Lecturer at ETH Zurich, has been[announced](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-103437.html)by her alma mater as an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Health Sciences and Technology.
