  "text": "Eight RedHawks Recognized as Academic All-MAC\nEight student-athletes from Miami University have been honored as Academic All-MAC for women's soccer, recognizing their excellence in both academics and athletics. To qualify, students must maintain a minimum 3.20 GPA and participate in at least half of their team's contests. The honorees include Mercedes Schroer, Taylor Hamlett, Morhéa Hoefen, Kylee Beinecke, Makenna Morrison, Dominique Popa, Sydney Thompson, and Kayla Perfect. This accolade highlights the commitment of these athletes to succeed in their academic pursuits while competing at a high level.\n- Eight Miami University athletes recognized.\n- All honorees maintain a minimum GPA of 3.48, with the highest being 3.96.\nWhile the recognition celebrates individual achievements, it raises questions about the balance student-athletes must strike between their academic responsibilities and athletic commitments.
