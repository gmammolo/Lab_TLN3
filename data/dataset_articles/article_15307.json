  "text": "Rochester Music Boosters Established For School Choir, Band Assistance\nBy Leah Sander\nInkFreeNews\nROCHESTER — Rochester Community Schools students in choir, band and color guard are now receiving extra assistance with instruments, uniforms and more thanks to a local group.\nThe Rochester Music Boosters was established as a nonprofit in February and officially started fundraising at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year.\nThough officially separate from RCS, its mission is to “benefit the (corporation’s) music programs,” said Brenda McClain.\nShe serves as president of the group, with Shawn Rensberger the vice president, Natalie Leslie the treasurer and Natalie Damer the secretary.\nThough all of the leadership has kids who either are currently involved with music at RCS or who were previously, people don’t have such connections to join the boosters, said McClain.\nThe group meets at 6 p.m. the third Thursday of each month in the Rochester High School choir room, and anyone is welcome to come. There’s no cost to show up for a meeting or formally join the boosters.\nRochester Music Boosters will have its next meeting on Jan. 16, skipping December due to the holidays.\nAs the group had to pay for startup costs, its money has gone thus far to snacks for kids in the music programs.\nWith continued fundraising, money should pay for field trips, equipment, attire and more for those “primarily in middle and high school,” said McClain.\nTeachers will make requests to the boosters, with the group deciding on whether or not to approve them.\nFundraising has included selling music-themed T-shirts through The Winning Edge, Nubiano’s Pizza punch cards and concessions for the visitor’s side at home football games. The group also benefited from a give-back day at Dairy Queen.\nIts ongoing fundraiser is through RaiseRight. People may buy gift cards at [raiseright.com](https://www.raiseright.com/), with a QR code on the [Rochester Music Boosters Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089929521473). A portion of the proceeds goes back to the boosters.\n“We’re always willing to take donations,” added McClain.\nPeople may message the group’s Facebook page or email [[email protected]](https://www.inkfreenews.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to learn how to give a general donation.\nMcClain said money given through the boosters “enhances what (the music programs are) already doing.”\n“The programs don’t really receive a lot of funding from the school system. They have a nominal amount each year … and they have to try to make that stretch so far,” she said.\nRensberger’s wife Jera Rensberger said the money from the boosters helps kids “who are not sports-oriented” participate in activities they prefer.\nLeslie added supporting the music boosters “can show our kids that your community stands behind you.”",
