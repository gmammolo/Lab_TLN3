The past few years have brought a couple of important ones to the forefront for University of Michigan-Flint senior Alexander White.\n\"I'm the kind of person who worries a lot about the future—will I be able to get a good job? Will I be prepared for what comes next? You know, I think with my experiences graduating from high school during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of uncertainty. I felt a lot of pressure to choose the right path,\" said White, who was recently named a Fall 2024 Maize & Blue Distinguished Scholar and will graduate Dec. 15 with a bachelor's in business administration operations and supply chain management and a minor in Spanish.\n\"I initially chose to attend UM-Flint because of its affordability and proximity to home, but the incredible support I received during my first two years made me realize it was a great long-term decision.\"\nAfter beginning his college studies early while attending high school in Grand Blanc, White first experimented with different majors and classes, struggling to find the right path. \"Ultimately, I knew I wanted to work for a manufacturing company in a job that allowed me to travel and explore international opportunities,\" he said. \"I connected early with the former career development manager at the School of Management, who was integral in helping me find my way. I gained a lot of confidence through the different workshops he offered, so when Boeing came to the career fair last year, I was very prepared to connect with them and advocate for an internship.\"\nFor current and future students at UM-Flint, White stressed how vital the career service support he received has been in preparing him for his future. \"All students, no matter their major, should connect early and often with the folks in Career Services,\" he said. \"You don't know what a job will be like until you do it, so take advantage of their expertise! They are there to help you succeed.\"\nWhite spent the summer of 2024 working in the Seattle-area, putting the skills and ideas he'd learned in his courses at UM-Flint into practice. \"It was the perfect experience! I spent most of my time at the Boeing Everett Factory offices, visited suppliers in Washington and California, and attended intern networking events they hosted, so I learned a lot,\" he said. \"It also showed me how supply chain management connects with all levels of a business, so there is a lot of opportunity for growth and development in my career.\"\nHis experiences at Boeing led directly to him securing a position with Parker Hannifin's Supply Chain Leadership Development Program, which he'll begin shortly after graduation. \"They liked that I had hands-on experience in the aerospace industry, and it turned out that I had also worked with one of their subsidiaries during my internship at Boeing, so that was a real plus,\" said White. \"The skills I've developed at UM-Flint, in terms of core business practices and professionalism, have truly prepared me to make the most of this opportunity. Being named a Maize & Blue Scholar is one more thing I can add to my resume, and I think it will have a long-term positive impact on my career.\"\nWhite is keeping an open mind when considering his future career trajectory. \"I'd like to work in this field for a while and then maybe go to law school, perhaps get into corporate law, with some experience in these industries under my belt,\" he said. \"And, eventually, I'd like to own my own business—but that might be, you know, 20 or 30 years from now! I'm focused on building a solid foundation, and UM-Flint has helped me get a great start.\"\nKat Oak\nKat Oak is the communications specialist for the College of Arts, Sciences, and Education.
