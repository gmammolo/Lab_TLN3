  "text": "BUNCOMBE COUNTY, N.C. (WLOS) — Recruiting teachers has been an issue for schools not just locally in Buncombe County, but statewide.\nAccording to the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, since March of 2023, over 10,000 previously employed teachers are no longer in the profession.\nSome schools have different solutions. At Buncombe County Schools, they are using their own students to be a part of that solution.\n“I wasn’t 100% certain if I wanted to be a teacher,” Caylee Smart told News 13. “It was in the back of my mind.”\nBut, it turns out she is pretty good at it.\n[CAROLINA PANTHERS, TEPPER FOUNDATION GIVE BACK TO SWANNANOA STUDENTS AND STAFF](https://wlos.com/news/local/panthers-tepper-foundation-give-back-swannanoa-students-staff-joy-to-carolinas)\n“Just seeing her command a classroom – I would feel comfortable stepping in and having her teach my class today,” North Buncombe High School teacher Andrew Shelton said.\nAlthough, Caylee is not like most teachers – she is a senior at North Buncombe High School.\n“We’re kind of one of the guinea pig groups trying this out for the first time as a class,” Smart said. “I didn’t want to waste time in college trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I wanted to know it before I got there. I don’t think I was expecting to teach a class by the end of this semester.”\nCaylee and other high school students are teacher cadets. It is a program that helped BCS mold teachers in the 1990’s and returned last year.\n“All of our cadets are in classrooms,” said Shelton, who advises the program for North Buncombe. “We’ve had Caylee across our whole district. It’s pulled directly from college-level material and put into our course load. We’ve nicknamed it Grow Your Own. We need to do that.”\n[WARREN WILSON COLLEGE RECEIVES HISTORIC $10M GIFT](https://wlos.com/news/local/warren-wilson-college-swannanoa-historic-10m-gift)\nBuncombe County Schools, the BCS Foundation and local partners pitched in to bring the Cadets back.\n“I went to workforce meetings and kept hearing about the decline and the need,” BCS Foundation Executive Director Christy Cheek said. “The workforce depends on education. Education drives the workforce. We need to make sure that it is seen as the most important job that anyone can have. We have great teachers here at Buncombe County Schools. We also need to recruit and retain.”\nMore students are on their way through the course. The hope is that ones like Caylee come back.\n“We already told her that she needs to get on the sub list and get ready to substitute,” Cheek said with a smile. “I’m so happy to know our future is in good hands.”\n“They can reach these students in a way better than that of someone who’s from across the United States,” Shelton added. “Selfishly, we want to have students like Caylee back in our classrooms. I’m so excited to see students like Caylee come in with a new spirit and new ideas.”\n[UNC ASHEVILLE TO HONOR OVER 200 GRADUATES ON DECEMBER 13 CEREMONY](https://wlos.com/news/local/unc-asheville-honor-over-200-graduates-december-13-ceremony-psychology-biology-332-gpa-kimberly-van-noort#)\nWherever they end up, the cadets are hitting the ground running.\n“It’s been really great,” Smart said. “It’s given me so much experience and confidence in what I want to do going forward. I’m learning more than I do in my traditional classes by being outside of the classroom and other environments.”\nTo learn more about the BCS Foundation and information to help the program, click [here](https://foundation.buncombeschools.org/).",
