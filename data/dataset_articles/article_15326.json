  "text": "ELIZABETHTON — State and local leaders came together on the grounds of the former Carter County Workforce Development Complex on a cold Thursday afternoon to break ground on a $40 million state project to be called the Carter County Higher Education Center.\nIt will provide new classrooms and other facilities to support the Carter County campuses of Northeast State Community College and the Tennessee College of Applied Technology Elizabethton. It will also provide accommodations for the Middle College program of Carter County School System, the second largest middle college program in the state.\nThe project will add about 71,000 gross square feet of new space. Buildings will include high-bay training spaces, laboratories, and classrooms It will also have space for administrative, student, and support requirements for academic programs and hands-on instruction.\n“This is a historic occasion,” said Tennessee Board of Regents Chancellor Flora W. Tydings. She praised two people for making the education center possible: Carter County Mayor Patty Woodby and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee.\nTydings said Woodby was “the brains behind the building.” Tydings said Woodby's passion and spirit made it happen. She said the other force that made it possible was when Gov. Lee said “I have decided to run the table on your master plan. We are going to put the whole thing in the budget.” She said that amounted to $1 billion.\nTydings said that when she goes to other parts of the country and talks about the fact that her governor and the state legislature voted to spend $1 billion into the system, they look at her like she is not telling the truth. She said the next thing they ask is if the state floated a bond for the project. She said the state was not borrowing, it was paying cash because Tennessee is the best managed state in the nation, thanks to the legislators.\nShe said two of the best partners in the state education system, the TCAT and the community college, are coming together to make the project into \"a center of higher education learning, where people will come, and they will get a job, and it will change their life and change the lives of their families, and it will change the community. I can’t wait to be back in 2026 to cut the ribbon on this building.”\nMayor Woodby said the education center was the first project she took on when she became mayor. She said the irony is that three years ago on this day, Dec. 5, she had Gov. Lee tour this ground to discuss the idea of building an education center on the site. She said her hope is that this facility will enable “our children to enter into the workforce, but not only have jobs but be able to purchase homes and raise their families in this community. To not have to leave to look for work. We want them to be able to stay here and love our community.”\nSenator Rusty Crowe represented Carter County and told the Johnson City Press “I have to say that Mayor Woodby used Sen. Jon Lundberg and I early on to make this happen. She was laser focused on this approach for our students. We met in my office in Nashville for a call with Chancellor Tydings to try to secure the $40 million appropriation for the project. Mayor Woodby was very convincing. Chancellor Tydings was excited about this approach and she and Gov. Lee made this happen.”\nNortheast State Community College President Jeff McCord and Tennessee College of Applied Technology President Heath McMillian both pledged to be strong supporting partners in the project. McMillian said “the new center and the partnership with Northeast State will help us better serve students and provide more opportunities to gain the skills needed for local careers.”\nMcCord said “Northeast State is proud to be a partner in the Carter County Higher Education Center and looks forward to the positive impact it will have on the prosperity of the people of Carter County. The good things happening on this site will no doubt ripple across the region.”\nThe facility is scheduled to open in fall 2026, with Thompson & Litton, an architectural, engineering, and land surveying firm based in Wise, Va. overseeing the project’s design.",
