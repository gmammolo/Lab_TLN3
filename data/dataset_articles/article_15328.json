  "text": "A recent “ love letter about change ” discussing the state of UX in 2025 has been making waves in our industry. While well-intentioned, it paints quite a pessimistic picture of where we’re heading. The authors write that “that UX buzz, that peak we hit in the late 2010s, has faded” and suggest that “UX is increasingly a byproduct of business objectives, not the driving force.”\nSide note: I recently wrote a newsletter which paints a much more positive view of 2025 . I would encourage you to read that too.\nHaving witnessed numerous cycles of change in the digital industry, this perspective seems overly doom-laden. Let’s examine why there’s actually plenty of reason for optimism about the future of UX.\nThe AI Evolution: Enhancement, Not Replacement The article suggests we’re “handing our designs to Figma while it trains its AI.” This echoes concerns I heard when desktop publishing emerged – many graphic designers feared it would replace them. While desktop publishing did change the industry, it didn’t eliminate the need for professional designers. Instead, it transformed how we work.\nThe same pattern will likely emerge with AI in UX design. Rather than replacing designers, AI will shift our role toward becoming design curators. We’ll focus less on designing every individual element and more on selecting the right solutions for specific problems. Most importantly, we’ll continue to provide what AI cannot: genuine user empathy and nuanced understanding of human needs.\nDesign Systems: Evolution, Not Limitation The authors express concern about “handing our design systems to growth teams.” However, design systems aren’t limiting creativity – they’re enabling consistency and efficiency. For most informational and transactional websites, design systems provide significant benefits. They ensure coherent user experiences and allow designers to focus on solving unique challenges rather than reinventing standard patterns.\nThe Reality of Business Integration There’s a notion in the article that suggests we’ve lost influence, stating that “designers have always aimed to exert vast influence within their organizations.” This perspective misunderstands the fundamental nature of UX design. Our work has always been, and should be, collaborative. User experience touches every aspect of a business – it’s not something that can or should be designed in isolation.\nThe suggestion that companies have stopped caring about users misses a crucial point: businesses have always cared about users to the extent that it benefits their bottom line. This hasn’t changed – it’s simply business reality.\nEconomic Cycles and Industry Evolution The article points to current challenges like conference closures and layoffs as signs of industry decline. These are actually symptoms of broader economic conditions rather than a fundamental shift in the value of UX. We’re emerging from a global pandemic and economic downturn – these impacts are cyclical, not permanent.\nThe Future of UX Design While the article suggests some might need to “rethink their career focus,” this seems premature. UX design encompasses far more than interface design – it’s about the end-to-end experience. This broader perspective of UX will continue to be vital for businesses.\nYes, certain aspects of UI design might be increasingly supported by AI, but this opens up opportunities to focus on more complex challenges. The key is to see these changes as evolution rather than extinction.\nLooking Forward Every technological shift brings fears and uncertainties. However, history shows us that these changes typically lead to evolution rather than elimination. The future of UX lies not in resisting these changes but in adapting to them while maintaining our core focus: understanding and advocating for users.\nThe skills that make UX designers valuable – empathy, problem-solving, and understanding human behavior – will remain crucial. These fundamental abilities will continue to be essential, even as the tools and techniques we use evolve.",
