  "text": "Kangaroo Flat Primary School students have new uniforms - and they mean a lot. A total of 30 students from grade 3 to 6 students have worked alongside local First Nations artists and elders to learn about their culture and find a way to share their stories with the wider school community. The outcome of this project is a new school uniform, including a T-shirt and hat, which reflects Indigenous culture. The My Story, Understanding My Culture project also involved Indigenous children sharing their cultural stories and taking part in a special assembly involving dance, story-telling and performance. The project was funded by VicHealth and was a joint initiative with the City of Greater Bendigo and the Dja Dja Wurrung arts, education and tourism enterprise. \"This project aimed to empower young First Nations students from Kangaroo Flat Primary School to share their cultural stories in a way of their choosing,\" the city&apos;s community partnerships manager Andie West said. \"It was created to address several priorities identified by children living in City of Greater Bendigo who said they wanted more opportunities to participate in culture and have an increased visibility of culture in the community.\" As part of the project, the students took part in workshops and excursions where they explored culture and wrote their &apos;story&apos;. They also designed a piece of art which has been incorporated into the new uniforms. \"Most students reported that after participating in the project, they feel better about being themselves, feel more connected to culture, and feel safer to show and share their culture at school,\" Ms West said. \"It&apos;s been a really great project with a fantastic outcome for the Kangaroo Flat Primary School community.\" The items have been added to the school&apos;s uniform options and will be sold to students in 2025.",
