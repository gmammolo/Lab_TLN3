  "text": "OSWEGO COUNTY – Riley Wood, a 2023 graduate of Oswego County P-TECH, is making waves in the workforce as the youngest Regional Operator hired by National Grid. In this role, Wood oversees a distribution grid delivering high-voltage transmission to more than 566,000 customers across Central New York, showcasing the critical skills and expertise gained during their educational journey. At a recent ceremony celebrating Oswego County as the first ACT Work-Ready Community in the northeastern United States, Wood spoke about the pivotal role of the National Career Readiness Credential (NCRC), earned through the ACT WorkKeys assessment, in transitioning from school to career. “The applied schooling I received through P-TECH, including the ACT WorkKeys assessment, is the sole reason for my success in finding, obtaining and succeeding in my career,” Wood shared. “Not only does the ACT credential grab attention from employers, but it also helped me prepare for aptitude tests, which were key to landing my current job.” The NCRC is a nationally recognized credential that validates essential workplace skills across industries and occupations. It is earned by successfully completing three ACT WorkKeys assessments, which are offered at no cost to Oswego County residents. Oswego County Workforce Development is proud to support residents in earning the NCRC, strengthening their transition into employment and bolstering the local workforce. For more information about the NCRC, ACT WorkKeys assessments or how to get started, contact Oswego County Workforce Development at 315.591.9000 or visit CiTiboces.org/ACT . Print this entry",
