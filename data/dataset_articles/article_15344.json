  "text": "LONDON: Muhammad has become the most popular name for boys in England and Wales, overtaking Noah.\nThe figures from the Office for National Statistics do not group together the different spellings of Muhammad, meaning that all the various iterations of the name together have made it the most popular for many years.\nMohammed and Mohammad both appear in the top 100 names for boys born in England and Wales in 2023.\nThere were 4,661 children registered as Muhammad, increasing from 4,177 in 2022.\nThe name was popular in regions with higher Muslim populations, such as London, the West Midlands, Yorkshire, and the North West.\nMohammed was the 28th most popular, with 1,601 newborns registered, while Mohammad was 68th, with 835.\nOther Muslim boys’ names in the top 100 include Yusuf, Ibrahim, and Musa.\nThe third most popular boys’ name was Oliver, followed by George and Leo.\nFor girls, Olivia has remained the most popular name for eight years. Amelia and Isla have been second and third for two years in a row.\nThe top 100 girls’ names included Layla, Maryam, and Fatima, which are all favorites with Muslim families.\nThe ONS said popular culture remained a key influence for parents choosing names for their babies.\nIncreasing numbers were names after music stars Billie Eilish and Lana Del Rey, and actors Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy.\nEven the names of celebrity babies such as the offspring from the Kardashian-Jenner family, Reign and Saint, gained popularity.",
