  "text": "Established in 1995, ICFAI Business School (IBS) has grown impressively and achieved widespread recognition from business and industry, academic circles and professional bodies. IBS offers high-quality programs in different areas of management to a cross-section of students, executives and professionals across India. IBS is reputed for innovative program design and delivery, quality courseware, personalized instruction, strong industry interface, research, consultancy and publications. IBS has a growing alumni base of around 70,000 who are currently pursuing fast track careers in India and abroad.\nCASE BASED LEARNING\nIBS is among the very few institutions in India that have made case-based learning a critical component of pedagogy. Almost all the courses at IBS are taught through case studies. The case studies are tailor-made to the requirements of different subject areas and topics. The Case Research Center (CRC) is a Centre of Excellence of the ICFAI.\nTEACHING\nStudents at IBS are taught through the “learning by doing methodology”. In other words, IBS lays greater emphasis on experiential learning from among several innovative pedagogies. Some examples of experiential learning at IBS involve externships, visits to exhibitions, participating in hackathons, business simulations, internships, group activities and role plays. Students learn by “doing”.\nINDUSTRY INTERFACE\nIBS has a strong, active, and growing interface with business and industry, with experts from a range of leading companies delivering regular guest lectures and serving as members of various advisory boards.\nDIVERSITY ON CAMPUS\nThe student community at IBS is truly diverse. Students come from different states, social and cultural backgrounds, and all walks of life. They become a part of the IBS community, and get an unparalleled exposure to different cultures, languages, and ways of living. They organize and participate in various curricular and extracurricular activities.\n(A marketing initiative by Open Avenues)",
