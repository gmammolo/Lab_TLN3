  "text": "Hundreds of UWM alumni from Milwaukee to Florida, Arizona to Virginia, and scores of places in between made the 20th consecutive UWM Alumni Association Panther Prowl 5K a roaring success. Together, they collectively raised $20,000 – meaning the Prowl has now raised nearly $600,000 in student scholarship support during its 20 years.\nParticipants completed their virtual runs from Oct. 9-13, and a pair of teams stood out from the pack. Congratulations goes to the Pacemakers as they fielded the Prowl’s largest team this year with 30 members, and the HBSSW Asphalt Kickers checked in as the top fundraising team with a total of $5,100. Each team will receive a trophy, not to mention some bragging rights, until next year’s Prowl.\nIndividually, Itzel Nunez was crowned winner of the Panther Prowl 5K photo submission contest and can now make future runs with her reward – a set of Google wireless headphones. Nunez’s creative Instagram entry showcased her first 5K along a path near Lake Michigan with the Buena Tierra Run Club.\nSeveral other fun photo entries were awarded prizes that included gift cards from Performance Running Outfitters and UWM Alumni Association swag. You can view photo submissions in the Panther Prowl 2024 Photo Album.\nThis year’s Prowlers ranged in age from 1 to 88 from 63 cities in 12 states. They competed under team names like SOIS Infomaniacs, Free the Bound Periodicals and The Running Experiments. Prowl sponsors included Direct Supply, Educators Credit Union, Liberty Mutual and Milwaukee Magazine.",
