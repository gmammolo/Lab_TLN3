  "text": "Bengaluru: Leveraging the demand for nurses in foreign countries, the state govt is considering launching language classes for nursing students keen on pursuing careers abroad. German, Japanese, Italian, and English are likely to be in the first set of languages taught.As per the plans, Karnataka Vocational Training and Skill Development Corporation (KVTSDC) will set up language labs at four centres in the state. Nursing colleges can collaborate with the corporation to send students to these programmes.The move follows several countries approaching the govt for skilled manpower. Recently, the Consul General of Italy in Bengaluru met Sharan Prakash Patil, minister of medical education and skill development. \\\"The consul highlighted there is a severe shortage of nurses in Italy. They are planning to recruit at least a thousand nurses from India. One of the challenges pointed out was the language barrier. We're therefore planning for language training for nursing students,\\\" said an official.The department said there is similar interest evinced by other countries such as Germany, Japan, and Australia. The department, which was initially planning to start with German, Japanese, and English, is now considering Italian as well.KVTSDC, a registered govt agency, is involved in upskilling candidates and acts as a nodal agency for ethical recruitment. Foreign language will be the latest addition to the skilling project. It is likely the department also sets up a standard operating procedure to select students who can make use of the facility.Meanwhile, the Centre for Global Languages, Bengaluru City University, in association with JICWELS (Japan International Cooperation of Welfare Services, Japan), organised a seminar titles ‘Kaigo-Nursing Care' recently.At the seminar, JICWELS said Japan is becoming a geriatric nation and young healthcare workers from other countries are sought after as the active working age is low there. JICWELS listed the eligibility criteria, pay package, etc. at the event. The BCU Centre for Global Languages offers a specialised course for skilled workers, like nurses and others, in the Japanese language and Japanese work ethics and culture.There are about 350 nursing colleges in Karnataka.",
