  "text": "The early signing period officially opened on Wednesday. Here's a roundup of National Signing Day ceremonies held in Northwest Indiana.\nMorton celebrates milestones\nLebron Hill didn't miss a route when he stepped onto the football field for the first time as a teenager. The 6-foot-5, 195-pound wide receiver proved his determination could earn him a Division I scholarship, even if he's only played the sport for a few years.\n\"Just a year and a half ago I was just playing basketball. I really wasn't taking football that serious,\" Hill said. \"Football changed my life.\"\nHill was surrounded by friends and family as he signed with Vanderbilt Wednesday afternoon in Morton's black box auditorium.\nGovernors' head football coach Mac Mishler took pride in Hill receiving a scholarship from an SEC university without having to attend a high school outside of his hometown.\nPeople are also reading…\n\"To be given this opportunity to commit to the school that I'm committed to, it took a lot of hard work and dedication in the classroom, and I'm thankful,\" Hill said.\nMorton linebacker Freddy Brown officially became a Bronco after signing with Western Michigan. Brown said football has always been the one thing to get him through tough times and it's a dream come true to continue pursuing it in college.\n\"I remember coming in, I wasn't confident that I would get to this level at all,\" he said. \"I didn't think I was good enough but as I showed up every day and put in the work. I saw the potential within myself to keep playing.\"\nMorton also celebrated quarterback Holland Harris on signing with Division II University of Indianapolis.\n3 Merrillville standouts sign\nNearly 100 friends, family, teammates and coaches gathered Wednesday afternoon to honor Merrillville's John Peters, Trent Nixon and Adam Camphor as they signed national letters of intent with universities across the Midwest.\nPirates head coach Brad Seiss said Wednesday was not only a big day for each player and their families but also Merrillville's football program as a whole.\n\"The rewards that they get are also rewards for us,\" Seiss said. \"The fact that you have kids going to the next level, they're able to represent our football program.\"\nPeters, who played wide receiver and defensive back, will continue his athletic career at Western Michigan. The three-star recruit had 36 total tackles, one sack and one forced fumble this season. Peters scored eight touchdowns, including a pick 6.\nAfter his signing, his eyes became watery as he noticed his mom crying tears of joy.\n\"I told my mom I was going to make it out of Merrillville and she didn't believe me at first,\" he said between pauses. \"Now I'm showing her that I'm not going to fail her.\"\nNixon, a linebacker, led the Pirates in sacks. He said he wouldn't have wanted to go anywhere aside from Northern Illinois. The future Huskie said he's worked his entire life to perfect his game and continue playing at the next level.\nCamphor was surrounded by his mom and siblings as he signed with Southeastern Missouri State. Seiss said Camphor is the Pirates' first football player to become a Redhawk.\nAndrean's Finley heads to NIU\nJimmy Finley was a threat on both sides of the ball for Andrean. He led the 59ers in touchdowns (12), interceptions (5) and receiving yards per game (61.7).\nThe three-star recruit was also featured on SportsCenter's Top 10 in October after having a one-handed catch against Hanover for the No. 1 play of the night.\nFinley said he ultimately made the decision to sign with Northern Illinois because the coaching staff has treated him so well. Between watching film with their coaches and envisioning himself practicing with the team, it was a perfect fit.\n\"It's always been a dream of mine since a little kid (to play on TV) watching college football with my dad and brothers,\" he said. \"It means a lot to me having all the people in the world watching me and having my family watching me.\"\nCrown Point boasts 3 signees\nAfter going almost 15 years without a Division I player, Crown Point's football program has had seven players go DI in the past three years.\nNoah Ehrlich, Lucas Szymborski and Jacob Soley each signed with a school in the Midwest.\nEhrlich, the Duneland Athletic Conference's Offensive MVP, will continue his athletic career at Miami (Ohio). Szymborski will head to Ball State and Soley to Indiana State.\nHolley becomes a Jayhawk\nFour-star recruit Adrian Holley — the highest-ranked recruit in the area — will continue to represent Michigan City as he heads to Kansas. Holley had 12 sacks and 84 total tackles for the Wolves to close out his high school career.",
