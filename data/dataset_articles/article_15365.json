This nationally recognized program, supports families with young children by providing child development knowledge, parenting support, and resources to enhance school readiness.\n“This new Blue Ribbon status will hopefully increase family interest in our program and will serve as a testament to our PAT program’s dedication to exceeding requirements and providing the highest quality services possible to our community,” PAT Program Supervisor Christina Sotelo said in a news release.\nFirst 5 partners with families with children ages five and under, including prenatal and first-time caregivers in Ector and Midland counties. The various programs First 5 offers are free to the community.\n“It is rewarding and such an honor to receive this recognition for the first time in our program’s history,” Sotelo said in the release.\nThe First 5 team has been committed to ensuring they meet all 21 PAT essential requirements and quality standards by delivering exceptional services to families.\n“The parent educator provides families with personalized home visits, family goals, family conducted parent and child assessments, and access to local resources in our community,” said Sotelo.\nThe recognition provides assurance that they are a prudent investment and partner for families that would like extra support in assuring their children are meeting their developmental milestones.\nThe team will be recognized for their achievements at a national conference in Puerto Rico in October of 2025.",
