(WBZ NewsRadio) — Local billionaire Ernie Boch Jr. donated nearly 70 instruments to Roberts Elementary School in Medford, Mass. on Thursday.\nThe school’s music program was unable to replace their old instruments that were in poor shape because of low funding.\nMusic teacher Dr. Howard Stern was concerned that would mean that they couldn’t continue on with major aspects of the program, such as the 4th grade string ensemble.\n“We couldn’t keep up with the costs, and we couldn’t replace the ones that needed to be replaced, and we started to think we couldn’t have this program anymore,” Dr. Stern said. “It would be a shame to lose that.”\nThe donated instruments include ukuleles, 45 violins, and a brand-new piano. Dr. Howard emphasized how important a donation like this is for giving students an artistic outlet.\n“Music gives free reign to the heart and the soul of a student when they’re alone and when they’re with their communities,” Dr. Stern said.\nBoch is a Berklee College of Music graduate and the donation was made through his Music Drives Us Foundation .\nWBZ NewsRadio's Madison Rogers (@MadisonWBZ) reports.\nFollow WBZ NewsRadio: Facebook | Twitter | Bluesky | Instagram | iHeartmedia App | TikTok",
