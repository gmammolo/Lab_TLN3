  "text": "By Taylor Johnson ,\n1 hours ago\nModesto City Schools has reported its student achievement rate for the 2023-24 school year, which show a recovery in the percentage of African American students who graduated.\nAround 90% of African American students in the Class of 2024 graduated, up approximately 7 points from the year prior. However, the 2023 graduate rate of Black students — 83% — was below 2022’s 93%, which was the highest in recent years.\nStudents who identify as Hispanic or white, students with disabilities and English learners all saw a slight increase. Around 91% of Hispanic students graduated, while 92% of white students graduated.\nAs for English Learners, around 84% graduated last school year, compared to 78% in 2023. The district also saw an increase in the number of these students reclassified as fluent English speakers, with 856 students reclassified.
