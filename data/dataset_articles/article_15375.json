  "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Elementary school students might be too young to think about their college plans, but a new addition paid for by the Big Ten could help get them there.\nRobert L. Frost School 106 on Indianapolis' northeast side unveiled its new media center Thursday morning. The room features brand new furniture and hundreds of books for the students.\nThe room where the media center now stands was a long-abandoned portion of the school. Indianapolis Public Schools superintendent Aleesia Johnson says the library is a win in more ways than one.\n\"This space once was a place that just stored things that were unwanted,\" Johnson said. \"To see the transformation into a place where kids can come and dive into the world beyond is pretty meaningful.\"\nDozens of Frost children sporting Big Ten t-shirts toured the media center shortly after the ribbon cutting.\n\"I will be very happy to see some of the books so I can read more,\" said Frost second-grader Kyrie Woods.\nThe Big Ten also awarded tickets to Saturday's championship game between Oregon and Penn State to Frost students with perfect attendance. It also gave $1,000 to a teacher who has spent more than a decade at the school.\n-\nDefense rests in trial against two IMPD officers in death of Herman Whitfield\nClosing arguments will begin Friday morning in the trial of two IMPD officers accused of the in-custody death of Herman Whitfield III.Medical licensing board agrees to dismiss complaint against Carmel doctor\nA Carmel holistic doctor once accused of misconduct will not be disciplined, a state panel decided Thursday.Richmond Police accused of misleading media about slain informants\nAn employee with the Richmond Police Department is under fire for allegedly lying to the media after saying a man and woman found dead in Fort Wayne earlier this year were not informants.Getting benched may have been best thing that happened to Anthony Richardson\nBoth second-year quarterbacks are playing well since returning to the starting lineup. They have a long way to go to prove they can be franchise quarterbacks. But there’s far more optimism now.",
