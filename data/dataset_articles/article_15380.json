Photo by UNDP/Gela Bedianashvili\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in partnership with Free University, hosted an engaging moot court competition this week, focusing on human rights education. With 42 teams from nine Georgian universities participating, the event provided a platform for students to develop their advocacy skills. Teams argued as either claimants or respondents, sharpening their critical thinking and deepening their understanding of human rights protection.\nFree University of Tbilisi emerged as the winner of the competition, while Tbilisi State University secured second place. This event is part of the broader LEAD: Leadership, Equality, Advocacy, and Democracy project, aimed at supporting changes that protect minority rights and combat discrimination in Georgia.\nThe LEAD initiative, which is funded by Norway with a $4 million budget for the 2022-2025 period, focuses on a three-pronged approach: empowering vulnerable minorities, tackling the most challenging human rights issues through evidence-based campaigns, and supporting both state institutions and civil society organizations. By creating platforms for collaboration, LEAD is working towards a more inclusive and democratic Georgia, fostering a society where everyone’s human rights are respected and protected.\nThis competition, alongside other LEAD initiatives, is integral in shaping the future of human rights advocacy in Georgia, encouraging young people to take an active role in defending equality and justice.\nBy Team GT\nTags: Free University LEAD Norway funding Georgia United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Share Share Tweet Related Posts Highlights Court sentences Nika Gvaramia to 12 days of administrative detention December 6, 2024 Highlights Actor Andro Chichinadze and comedian Onise Tskhadadze face up to 9 years in prison December 6, 2024 Highlights Arrests and raids anger protesters, 8th night of rallying begins December 5, 2024 Recommended Experience Seamless Connectivity with Silknet eSIM in Georgia 5 months ago Georgia to Celebrate First Europe Day with European Union Candidate Status 7 months ago Georgian Foreign Minister Holds Farewell Meeting with French Ambassador to Georgia 2 years ago Natia Mezvrishvili on Dealing with 2 Political Giants 3 years ago Giorgi Gakharia: We were Told We Were Capable of Nothing – It’s All a Lie and Ukraine is a Great Example of This 3 years ago GT Interview with Giorgi Badridze 3 years ago Russo-Ukrainian War and Georgia – Analysis from security expert Kakha Kemoklidze 3 years ago Navigation News Politics Business & Economy Social & Society Sports Culture International Where.ge Newspaper Magazine GEO OP-ED About Us History Our Team Advertising Subscription Contact Highlights Actor Andro Chichinadze and comedian Onise Tskhadadze face up to 9 years in prison Arrests and raids anger protesters, 8th night of rallying begins Actor Andro Chichinadze arrested Kezerashvili’s and Chikovani’s properties are being searched Ukraine Latest: NATO ‘Waiting for Trump’ on Key Decision about Kyiv Invite Update on the condition of opposition leaders/activists detained by using brute force Trending Business & Economy Experience Seamless Connectivity with Silknet eSIM in Georgia by Georgia Today June 26, 2024\nWhy Silknet's eSIM could be your top choice in Georgia Since its introduction, eSIM technology has become...\nVirtuosity and Versatility: Marc-André Hamelin Opens Tbilisi Piano Festival 2024 May 30, 2024 Where.ge Newspaper GEO Magazine Old Website 2000-2023 © Georgia Today",
