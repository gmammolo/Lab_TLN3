  "text": "The number of UC Riverside students and employees riding the bus to campus continues to increase.\nThe most recent ridership report shows 59,300 passenger boardings on Riverside Transit Agency, or RTA, buses for October, a 52% increase from October 2023 when it was 39,012.\nOctober is typically when the campus sees the highest ridership numbers, said Tara Pueschel, transportation demand management specialist with Transportation and Parking Services, or TAPS.\nThe numbers show a steady climb over the last four years after ridership dropped during the pandemic. Although ridership is not at the pre-COVID level, it has gone up each year even as work habits have changed.\nMore employees work remote or hybrid schedules now. In 2019, only 3% of employees telecommuted while this year 25% of employees telecommuted, according to a recent survey of commute habits.\nTAPS has partnered with RTA to offer students and employees free unlimited rides through the RTA UPASS program. It also contracts with RTA to offer Route 51 and Route 56, which travel within and directly around campus.\nRiders can swipe their R’Card at the electronic fare box when boarding or use RTA’S Go Mobile app to activate a pass on their smartphone. Learn how to activate your pass [here](https://transportation.ucr.edu/bus).\nRTA currently offers service on 32 local fixed routes, three CommuterLink express routes, and Dial-A-Ride, with five routes that make direct stops at UCR.\nDecember 5, 2024",
