  "text": "Football 12/5/2024 12:09:00 PM Cook Repeats as SEC Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year ATLANTA – University of Missouri graduate student quarterback Brady Cook has been named the Southeastern Conference Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year, the league office announced Thursday. Cook, who also claimed the honor in 2023, was chosen by a vote of the league's head coaches. He is the third player to repeat as the SEC Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year, joining Tim Tebow of Florida (2008-09) and Barrett Jones of Alabama (2011-12). The St. Louis, Missouri, native earned his bachelor's degree from Missouri as a magna cum laude graduate in December 2022 and added a Master's of Business Administration degree in May 2024. He was named a semifinalist for the William V. Campbell Trophy®, college football's premier scholar-athlete award, and is a four-time member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. After compiling 2,248 passing yards this season, Cook sits 73 yards shy of matching Brad Smith for third all-time in program history and just 274 yards short of becoming the first quarterback in school lore to pass and rush for 9,000 and 1,000 yards, respectively, in a Mizzou career. The No. 19 Tigers (9-3) will learn their postseason destination on Sunday. FOLLOW THE TIGERS For all the latest information on Mizzou Athletics, please visit MUTigers.com.
