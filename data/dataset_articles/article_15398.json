  "text": "The Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) will launch a six-week course on the business side of songwriting and music industry careers at Nashville State Community College’s White Bridge campus on Feb. 11. Supported by the Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR), the program will also be available online.\n“NSAI is excited to partner with Nashville State on this six-week program,” shares Bart Herbison , NSAI Executive Director. “We applaud TBR Chancellor Flora Tydings , Nashville State President Shanna Jackson and their teams for exploring innovative and affordable ways to bring knowledge about songwriting and associated music industry careers to students. Some of the very top industry professionals will be part of this journey only adding to its potential.”\nTaking place from 5:30 p.m.–7 p.m. each week, the sessions will consist of: “Professional Songwriting 101 — An Overview,” featuring singer-songwriter and social media personality Kaylee Rose ; “Songwriting — The Craft,” featuring Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member Tom Douglas ; “Songwriter and Artist Income Streams,” featuring KP Entertainment Founder/Manager Kerri Edwards ; “Publishing and Record Deals,” featuring Big Machine Music President Mike Molinar and Sony Music Nashville Vice President, A&R Margaret Tomlin ; “Songwriter Support Jobs;” and “A Day in the Life,” featuring two special guests.\n“This innovative partnership, developed through TBR’s Center for Workforce Development, brings together Nashville State and the Nashville Songwriters Association International in a way that exemplifies what makes Tennessee’s workforce development special—the ability to harness our state’s unique cultural strengths and turn them into career opportunities,” says Tydings. “By bringing together industry leaders to teach the next generation, we’re not just offering a course—we’re opening doors to careers in one of Tennessee’s most iconic industries. This is workforce development at its most innovative and exciting!”\nThe course has a nominal fee of $145 for NSAI members and $245 for non-members (which includes a year-long NSAI membership).
