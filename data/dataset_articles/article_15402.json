  "text": "You asked and we delivered: Here is Exeter University’s Spotify Wrapped 2024\nWe spotted the Swifties a mile away\nThe day has finally arrived. No, it’s not Christmas Day, it’s Spotify Wrapped Day! While we are all still drowning in deadlines, all still trying to secure a seat in the Forum Library and all still begging our housemates to put the heating on for more than 30 minutes, at least we have Spotify Wrapped to cheer us up.\nSpotify Wrapped is a day of reflection and judgement. Everyone races to post their screenshots onto their stories and caption it “no surprise there!” and “didn’t expect anything else!”. Everyone is always shocked by how many minutes they have and their top five artists as if they didn’t relentlessly play the same songs all year long…\nSo, we asked Exeter Uni students for their Spotify Wrapped to make up trends and habits the Exeter lot have. We already knew that 50% of your playlist is from Shazamming the music in top top of TP…\nTop artists\nIt is really no surprise that Taylor Swift is on nearly everyone’s top artists. After her major Eras Tour over summer, of course, she’s going to be up there. We see you Swift Soc girlies posting T-Swift on your stories.\nFollowing up from Taylor Swift is the Short n Sweet star, Sabrina Carpenter. Many students had Espresso and Please Please Please as their number one song (me included). Again, it really is no surprise to see in her the Exeter Spotify Wrapped. Us Exeter girls love pop girl anthems.\nOf course, the main pop girls CONQUERED the Exeter Spotify Wrapped. After Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter dominating the charts, many students absolutely loved the other popstars. We had a lot of Chappell Roan, Ariana Grande and, of course, Charli XCX. I mean, Brat summer was my whole personality so it would be shocking to not see Charli on there.\nMost Read\nApart from the predicted pop girls, many students were on the opposite end of the spectrum. We were surprised to see the number of people listening to Paolo Nutini – we got to give pop, indie boys their credit too. Also, a lot of students listening to Noah Kahan? I guess it’s the season of the sticks?\nMoving from pop, we had a lot of rap in some students Spotify Wrapped – rap in the Wrapped, if you will. One student absolutely loves Drake and even said it was her “fourth year in a row with Drizzy on top”. There were also mentions of Burna Boy and Kanye West (don’t let the Swifties see that)\nHonourable mentions\nI saw a lot of beabadoobee across many students’ Spotify Wrapped this year. Although I’m not an avid listener, I know she’s doing very well at the moment. One student even had all of her songs in her top five (that is commitment). I also saw a lot of Ethel Cain and Fiona Apple – I want to ask, who hurt you?\nWe ahave to give flowers to our rock music listeners out there. One student’s Spotify Wrapped consisted of all the rock and roll bands including The Rolling Stones and Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Absolutely love it. But, to my surprise, many students had My Chemical Romance on their Wrapped… I just got flashbacks to my cringey emo phase. Another person had a very interesting Wrapped consisting of Muse and Slipknot. You will definitely see them in Cavern headbanging on the dancefloor.\nI saw a lot of Lana Del Rey, which, as a Lana FAN, I’m very happy to see this. But we all need group therapy.\nLots of Frank Ocean, Coldplay, George Ezra and Hozier was spotted. Very mixed.\nFinally, two special shoutouts to two students. To the person who had Radiohead as their number one artist, I hope you’re doing well. And, to the person who had Radioactive by Imagine Dragons as their number one song, I hope you grow up soon.",
