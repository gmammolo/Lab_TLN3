  "text": "U of A earns recognition for student voting engagement\nThe University of Arizona is home to one of the nation's most democratically engaged student bodies, according to the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge.\nThe U of A is one of 471 colleges and universities named to the organization's 2024 list of Most Engaged Campuses for College Student Voting, released Nov. 19. The list recognizes the colleges and universities that sought to intentionally encourage \"nonpartisan democratic engagement to increase student voter engagement.\"\nThe U of A met the following criteria:\n- Participated in the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge\n- Shared 2022 National Study of Learning, Voting and Engagement (NSLVE) Reports with campus voting data with ALL IN\n- Developed and submitted a 2024 nonpartisan democratic engagement action plan with ALL IN\n- Listed a signatory to ALL IN's\nHigher Education Presidents' Commitment to Full Student Voter Participation\nThe Associated Students of the University of Arizona worked throughout election season on its successful Bear Down & Vote campaign, which sought to \"raise awareness, provide education and empower students to contribute positively to their community.\" ASUA hosted several town halls, workshops, information sessions and registration events to ensure students had access to all relevant information.\n\"It was a total team effort,\" said Adriana Grijalva, president of ASUA. \"It was so inspiring to see so many fellow students engage with the democratic process and make sure their voices were heard this election season.\"\nThe ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge \"envisions a more engaged and inclusive democracy,\" believing that a \"strong, vibrant and more representative American democracy will result from the greater inclusion of informed college student voters.\n\"The university is proud to support our students' civic engagement and democratic participation,\" said Amanda Kraus, interim vice president of Student Affairs. \"The Bear Down & Vote campaign exemplifies the leadership and commitment of our student body and is a testament to their exceptional efforts to make a positive impact.\"",
