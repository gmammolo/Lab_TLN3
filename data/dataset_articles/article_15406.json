  "text": "CNM Celebrates Grand Opening of Kathie Winograd Student Success Center on Main Campus\nOn Thursday, CNM celebrated the grand opening of its newest building, the Kathie Winograd Student Success Center. Located at the intersection of Coal Avenue and University Boulevard on Main Campus, the modern facility will redefine and improve the student experience, streamline student services, and provide a welcoming space for students and the community to connect with CNM.\nUnlike the various hallways and lines students have previously navigated in the outdated facility that’s being replaced, the new facility provides easy access to key services like advising, financial aid, scholarships, registration, student clubs, and more in a one-stop shop environment. CNM staff now greet students as they arrive and guide them to the services they need, similar to an Apple Store experience. The building’s open, inviting design also includes spaces for meetings, student clubs and events.\n“We are so proud that this outstanding new facility – with its convenient and prominent location – will become the new front door to CNM for our students and community,” said CNM President Tracy Hartzler. “This facility is the place where anybody who wants to improve their life through a CNM education or training can walk in and feel welcomed and supported, and quickly start their CNM journey to a brighter future.”\nYou can view a full photo gallery from the event below.",
