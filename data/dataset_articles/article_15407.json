In tandem, Seattle University has declared plans to build an art museum, underscoring its Jesuit mission to weave visual and performing arts into a comprehensive educational experience.\nThe integration process is underway, with Seattle University conducting an extensive review of Cornish College’s operations and compliance. Pending the necessary approvals, Seattle University is expected to acquire Cornish and become its controlling entity by the end of May 2025.\nFollowing this, a transition period will begin, allowing the integration of administrative operations while Cornish retains its accreditation and degree-granting authority. Full consolidation will happen after this period.\nMORE NEWS FROM FOX 13 SEATTLE WA officer arrested, accused of flashing gun in road rage incident\nJewell Loyd reportedly requests trade from Seattle Storm after investigation completed\n‘Happy Wrapped Day’: Seattle talks Top 5 Spotify artists\nOR donut shop with a cult following to open in Seattle next week\nSeattle councilmember Tammy Morales resigns, cites concerns over Council\nChild rape victim files claim against Federal Way Public Schools\nSeattle Sounders all-time leading goalscorer Raúl Ruidíaz to depart club\nSoundgarden members reuniting for Seattle benefit concert\nTo get the best local news, weather and sports in Seattle for free, sign up for the daily FOX Seattle Newsletter .\nDownload the free FOX LOCAL app for mobile in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for live Seattle news, top stories, weather updates and more local and national coverage, plus 24/7 livestreams from across the nation.\nDAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .\nOn your phone.
