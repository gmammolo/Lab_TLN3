  "text": "Warren County students build brighter futures through annual leadership summit\nBOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - Over 270 Warren County students from elementary to high school participated in the district’s third annual leadership summit at the Green River Regional Educational Cooperative.\nThroughout the day-long summit, students from across the district challenged one another to create short-term and long-term goals to improve their schools.\nWith mentorship from high school students, elementary and middle school students brainstormed what legacy they hope to leave behind once they move on through the school system. In turn, high school students offered their advice to students who would one day replace them in the halls of area high schools.\n“Don’t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone and you’re the leaders of the school. You’re going to be followed, even though you don’t think you are, people are going to follow after you. So, basically, just try to set a good example for everybody that’s going to come after you,” shared Brooks Vincent, a junior at Warren East High School.\nFor younger students, the summit is an opportunity to show how far they’ve come in their early leadership journeys and the contributions they’ve already made to the school district.\nRose Whitaker, a sixth-grade student at Rich Pond Elementary, has already set herself apart as a leader in the classroom and as a veteran of the annual leadership summit.\n“So, the qualities that I feel like a leader needs to have is they need to be responsible. They need to be able to sacrifice and take one for the team because if they can’t, if they’re just a self-centered leader, then it’s just going to be absolutely terrible and it’s basically going to be a dictatorship,” Whitaker said.\nThrough working collaboratively, the students created new goals to improve their schools they hope to expand on during next year’s summit.\n“We want to support our staff, we want to incorporate habits into daily learning and we would like to, these are like, kind of our main goals, and we want to see responsibility in students,” Whitaker continued.\nTogether, the students hope to collaboratively build a brighter future across the entire school district.\nCopyright 2024 WBKO.
