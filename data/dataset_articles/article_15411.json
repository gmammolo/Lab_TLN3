  "text": "BRENTWOOD, Tenn. — In January, around 4,000 ministry leaders and volunteers will gather in Nashville, Houston, Fort Worth and Ridgecrest, N.C., for Lifeway’s annual Vacation Bible School Preview events. These leaders will be immersed in Lifeway’s 2025 VBS theme – “Magnified!” As they learn the VBS songs and motions, play the games and preview the snacks and crafts, they’ll be surrounded by decorations that bring the theme to life.\n“We want leaders to experience the fun and energy that encompasses VBS while we take a deeper dive into Psalm 34:3,” said Melita Thomas, Lifeway’s VBS specialist. “As we lead them through Lifeway’s 2025 VBS material, the hope is that they begin to understand the grandeur and greatness of God through both small and large perspectives.”\nNext year’s theme is meant to point kids and leaders to worship God and reflect on His majesty.\nThe Lifeway 2025 VBS Preview event will not only explore the theme of this summer’s VBS, but it will equip potential volunteers and church leaders with tools to craft their own church’s VBS.\nVBS impact\nThomas is especially excited about this year’s theme.\nEverything from the decor to the music to the activities are designed to point kids to God and who He is as revealed in His creation. Thomas said when a kid or adult starts to notice the tiny details, “that’s when you really begin to see how big God is, who He is and how He cares about even the tiniest of things.”\nOnce they grasp that, their “only response is to praise Him, to make much of Him, to magnify Him,” Thomas continued.\nAs attendees learn about Lifeway’s 2025 VBS, they also take a moment to celebrate the immense impact of past VBS seasons. Last summer, Lifeway celebrated its 100th anniversary of ministry through VBS. Each summer, more than 2.5 million participants engage with Lifeway’s VBS curriculum across more than 25,000 churches. Thomas estimates around 70,000 people made a profession of faith in the 2024 VBS season alone. Thomas attributes this massive impact to God, but she’s thankful for the army of volunteers that makes VBS a reality each year in churches across the globe.\nBreakouts\nThe VBS Preview breakout sessions will encourage attendees to not only grasp the theme but to understand why VBS is important and why their roles matter.\nBreakout sessions will offer overviews of:\nTeaching resources for every age from infants through adults Rotation resources including snacks, recreation, music, missions and crafts Strategies for VBS directors Multi-age and Backyard Kids Club resources Decorating ideas Practical sessions are designed to equip new and experienced volunteers in areas including:\nLeading a child to Christ Navigating the unexpected at VBS Best practices for behavior management Effective follow-up strategies Creating a safe and secure campus Additionally, there will be four Spanish breakout sessions. More information about breakout sessions at VBS Preview can be found at Lifeway.com/VBS.\nComprehensive training\nThese events are formulated to comprehensively train volunteers who may not be actively involved in Kids Ministry at their church. At the end of the event, organizers hope leaders and volunteers feel prepared and confident to lead VBS this summer.\n“It really changes how they view their role during that week of VBS,” Thomas said.\nAll the VBS resources will be available for purchase in the event’s Lifeway store at each site. For those who want to touch and assess the materials in a tangible way, this shopping experience is a great option.\nThe two-day events will take place in Nashville Jan.10-11, 2025, Houston Jan. 17-18, 2025, Fort Worth, Texas, Jan. 24-25, 2025 , and Ridgecrest, N.C., Jan. 31-Feb.1, 2025.\nFor more information on Lifeway’s 2025 VBS and to register for a VBS Preview, visit Lifeway.com/VBS.\nAbout the Author Myriah Snyder Myriah Snyder is a writer for Lifeway Christian Resources.\nRead All by Myriah Snyder ›",
