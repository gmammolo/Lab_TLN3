  "text": "Attention educators and teachers! CATS is offering a special discounted Student Matinee performance of Where the Mountain Meets the Moon on Friday, April 25, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. at the Nevada Theatre. This performance is not open to the public, and tickets cannot be purchased through the CATS website; attendance is by reservation only.\nThe play is appropriate for grades 4 to 6; however, all grade levels are welcome. This enchanting and magical story about gratitude is unveiled by mystical creatures, like a dragon, a goldfish, numerous animal puppets, and The Man of the Moon, taking the audience on a cultural epic journey of discovery and artistry in ancient China.\nThe show promises to be a “feast for the senses” with lavish costumes and original music. It is appropriate for all ages. In addition to director Allison Chan, the creative team includes Pam Hodges, set designer; Tynowyn Woolman, composer and sound designer; Les Solomon, lighting designer; Jill Kelly, costume designer; Sara Quay, hair and makeup designer; and Hank Meyer, properties designer.\nStudents will meet the cast, director, and designers afterwards for a Q&A. A study guide would be available to the teachers to prepare the students for this memorable and educational field trip.\nIn addition, if teachers wish, CATS could come into the classroom to provide an age-appropriate activity to illustrate the themes of the story. We will customize our activities and presentations to the appropriate grade levels. Our goal is to work with the schools to enhance multicultural education.\nPlease contact Jeannie Wood at info@catsweb.org to reserve seats for your class. Spaces are limited and it’s first-come, first-served. The Student Matinee is sponsored by Community Players Trust.\nTickets to all other performances will be available on February 1, 2025, at https://catsweb.org/",
