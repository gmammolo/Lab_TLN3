  "text": "In This Section In This Section Explore All News Strengthening the Crummer Network: Welcoming New Leaders to the Crummer Alumni Board The Crummer Alumni Board is more than just a group of dedicated graduates—it’s a driving force behind the continued success of the Crummer Graduate School of Business. This service group donates their time, talent, and energy to benefit the school and its alumni, planning events, sponsoring initiatives, collaborating with various departments, and continually striving for the betterment of the Crummer community. The board’s active participation is crucial in maintaining a strong and vibrant alumni network.\nWe are pleased to announce the addition of two distinguished alumni to the board: Candy Cole ’13MBA and Terry Castillo ’21MBA. Their diverse backgrounds, combined with their commitment to giving back, will significantly enhance the board’s efforts. Learn more about these talented alums and discover why they decided to serve in this vital role.\nCandy Cole In April 2023, Candy Cole became the Executive Director of the Lake Nona Regional Chamber of Commerce, where she is dedicated to serving members, forging strategic partnerships, and fostering economic growth. Candy believes that building a thriving community requires strong connections, attentive listening, and providing the necessary support to help individuals and organizations succeed.\nCandy describes herself as a “maker”—someone who learns, educates, and shares innovative ideas with others. As a collaborative, mission-driven leader with a proven history of building community support for nonprofit organizations, she has utilized her broad skill set to manage nonprofits and assist entrepreneurs and small businesses across Central Florida.\nWith an MBA from Crummer and a BS in Accounting from the University of Central Florida, Candy is passionate about using her skills to help others. She believes everyone should have access to the tools, knowledge, and resources needed to realize their dreams.\nTerry Castillo Teresa “Terry” Castillo is a dynamic learning and development leader based in Kissimmee, Florida, and the Founder and Lead Strategist at Blue Hawk Strategies. She designs innovative, customized learning journeys that significantly boost team performance and productivity. As a School Board Member for Osceola County since 2018, Terry manages a $1.7 billion budget, champions educational equity, and fosters strong partnerships between schools and the community.\nTerry’s career includes leadership roles such as Director of Training and Delivery at Right to Be, where she led global training initiatives for major clients like L’Oréal Paris and Sephora, and Manager of Learning and Development at the Orange County Clerk of Courts. With her roots in training and delivery at Bright House Networks/Charter Communications, Terry has a proven track record of enhancing learning retention and skill application.\nTerry holds an MBA from Crummer and a BS in Legal Studies from Barry University. She is certified in Six Sigma White Belt, Storyline Articulate, Introduction to AI, and The Pinnacle Method Facilitation.\nQ & A Why did you decide to lend your time and talents to the alumni board?  \nCandy Cole: I joined the alumni board so I could help foster a sense of community, continue to develop and enhance my leadership skills, stay engaged with other leaders, develop meaningful relationships with fellow board members and alumni, and stay current regarding trends and developments that may impact the business community\nTerry Castillo: As someone who gained immensely from the Crummer experience, I am eager to give back to the community that has given me so much.\nWhat skills did you learn or experiences did you have from your MBA that you believe will help you in the position? \nCandy Cole: In my time at Crummer, I learned that the smartest person in the room often listens more than they speak. I learned how to really work to understand the perspectives of others and take those into account when dealing with a challenge. Working with people with vastly different personalities and skill sets was difficult, but it taught me a lot about being part of a high-performing team. I learned that you have to go slow to go fast; in other words, don’t rush to action. It is critical to take the time to develop a strategy and a plan and then turn that into a roadmap to achieve the goal. I also learned a lot about conflict resolution and how to respectfully disagree and resolve differences.\nTerry Castillo: I have applied the knowledge from every class I’ve taken in various ways. However, my ability to use data to tell a story and build a compelling case for my professional recommendations is a skill that I believe distinguishes me from many other professionals.\nWhat do you hope to achieve or assist with as a board member? \nCandy Cole: I enjoy adding value to the lives of others. I hope to experience the fulfillment that comes with giving back by helping others achieve their educational or professional goals, serve the school as well as the community, and bring awareness to the programs and initiatives that benefit students and alumni\nTerry Castillo: I aim to enhance alumni engagement, with a particular focus on increasing participation from those who graduated within the past 10 years.\nWhat do you believe are the benefits of participating on the alumni board? \nCandy Cole: There are so many benefits to participating on the alumni board. For me, these include engaging with diverse groups of individuals and other community leaders, staying informed about school programs and initiatives, improving my leadership and communication skills, and helping foster a sense of community among alumni.  \nTerry Castillo: I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know my fellow board members and learning from their experiences. Additionally, I appreciate the opportunity to network with current students and offer insights on how they can maximize their experience at Crummer.\nThe addition of Candy Cole and Terry Castillo to the Crummer Alumni Board is a testament to the strength and dedication of Crummer’s alumni community. Their diverse experiences and commitment to giving back will undoubtedly enhance the board’s efforts in supporting the school and its graduates. As they take on their new roles, both Candy and Terry bring valuable skills and fresh perspectives that will contribute to the continued growth and success of the Crummer network. Their involvement underscores the importance of alumni engagement in fostering a vibrant and connected Crummer community.\nLooking forward to the next alumni event?
