  "text": "Trail Ridge Middle School has become the first middle school in St. Vrain Valley Schools to introduce a Unified Theater program, a milestone that highlights the school’s dedication to providing meaningful opportunities for students of all abilities. Building on its strong Unified program, which has earned numerous awards, including this year’s “Chaka Sutton” Unified Champion School of the Year from Special Olympics Colorado, the theater initiative showcases the schools focus on fostering collaboration and connections.\n“The idea to start Unified Theater program at Trail Ridge felt natural,” said Drama Teacher Lindsay Sullivan. “I knew if the district was going to create a Unified program at the middle school level, it had to start here. Seeing the success of Unified Theater programs at Niwot High and Frederick High gave me the confidence to take the leap.”\nThe program’s debut production, The Enchanted Garden , will premiere on Friday, December 6, at 5 p.m. at Trail Ridge Middle School. Co-written by Sullivan and Special Education Teacher Becci Warren the play aligns with the program’s goals by celebrating themes of friendship and kindness. “Writing my own play allowed me to create the most accommodating experience possible,” said Sullivan. “ The Enchanted Garden offers roles tailored to each student’s unique strengths and opens opportunities for students of all abilities, both on stage and behind the scenes.”\nRehearsals have already shown how impactful Unified Theater can be. Students from Sullivan’s Technical Theater program have taken on mentorship roles, helping peers with speech and movement during rehearsals. “It’s been inspiring to see students not only perform but also help each other with speech and movement. The connections they’re building are incredible,” said Sullivan. “Many of our Unified students are performing for their first time, and their growth has been a source of pride for everyone involved.”\nFor eighth grader Molly Brickley, being part of Unified Theater has been an unforgettable experience. “I’ve had the privilege of working on lights, sound, and even designing the costumes for the production. I joined Unified Theater because I love helping everyone, and theater is something I’m really passionate about,” she said. “Having Unified Theater at our school is so exciting. It’s amazing to see everyone working together and supporting each other.”\nThe program has been met with enthusiasm from parents, students, and staff alike. Parents of Unified students are particularly excited about the new opportunities it provides, giving their children a chance to participate in ways that were not available before. The initiative highlights the school’s dedication to collaboration and kindness while reinforcing that theater truly is for everyone.\nTrail Ridge’s Unified Theater program exemplifies the school’s mission to create opportunities that connect and empower students. “The more programs we create that bring people together, the stronger our school community becomes — not just within our walls, but outside of them as well,” said Warren “We want to develop a school where everyone has something they can participate in and feel successful. The confidence this builds in students will encourage them to be great people throughout their lives.”",
