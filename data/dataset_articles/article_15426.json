  "text": "By Austin White ,\n2 hours ago\nAfter beating Parkrose High School 37-18 on Dec. 4 to open the girls high school basketball season, the Reynolds squad celebrated with a photo of them holding up their fingers in the shape of a W.\nIt’s been awhile since the Raiders could do that after going 0-25 in the 2023-2024 season. Their last win was Dec. 6, 2022, at home against Parkrose, which turned out to be their only win of the 2022-2023 season.\nFirst-year head coach Torrey Nelson hasn’t had much time with his team, saying the first game against Parkrose was the first real test of his players to see what he’s working with.\nOne game down, the coach is liking what he sees.\n“We haven’t even scrimmaged. We’ve worked on things, but we haven't had a chance to do it all,” Nelson said. “That first half, it was rough. In the second half, they settled down some and we kind of got into our places and did what we’re supposed to do and things started to fall into place.”\nThe game was tied at 13 at halftime after Parkrose won the second quarter 6-4 to tie things up.\nReynolds was struggling with fouls on defense while rarely getting a look at the rim on offense outside of freshman Jorie Robertson making a couple cuts to the hoop.\nIn the second half, the Raiders only gave up five points while scoring 24 themselves to pull away for the 37-18 win.\n“Coach was just telling us to push hard on defense,” Reynolds senior Jaslene Ratcliff said. “Make sure we try and do our traps and do our defensive plays and everything.”\nRatcliff was causing problems in the backcourt all night for the Parkrose guards, picking up seven steals and helping turn that into six points.\nReynolds has a bevy of guards who showed some promise, including sophomore Maliya Harley Cater, junior Harmony Porter, junior Yani Naknakhone and senior Nara Cordway.\nCordway came into the game in the fourth quarter and hit two 3-pointers and another jumper to finish the night with seven points.\nFor Nelson in his first year, it’s nice to have options and he’s sitting back looking at what his guard crew can do.\n“They all have been contributing (to the guard spot),” Nelson said. “I’ve seen what they could do individually and with no defense, but I didn’t know what to expect from them (playing in a game).\n“Once (Ratcliff) gets in better shape and continues to work, she’s going to be a big contributor for us.”\nThe freshman in Robertson perhaps was the best highlight, finishing the game with a double-double of 10 points and 10 rebounds.\nThe forward had no fear driving into the paint all night and putting on a spin move or a crossover to try and shake off her defender.\nHer early play is already winning new teammates and Nelson alike.\n“We needed her, we needed a big who knows how to use their body,” Ratcliff said of Robertson. “I love to see her on our team because she can use it and she can get her shots up.”\n“(Robertson has) been coached, but she’s still a raw talent,” Nelson added. “I got her for four years, and she’s gonna be hard to deal with because she already is. I’m excited for her and the team. We’re changing the program and the culture and she’s going to be a huge part of it moving forward.”\nFor Ratcliff, the next steps are continuing to learn under Nelson, who said his emphasis will be on defense this year and letting the offense flow from there.\nWith plenty of girls around her, Ratcliff is learning her role, but is excited about where her team is heading with a win under their belt.\n“It’s good, sometimes confusing because there are three (point guards) on the team,” Ratcliff said. “But we all try and figure it out and we all work good with each other so it’s not too much of a trouble.”\nThe path forward doesn’t get any easier for the Raiders, being in a Mt. Hood Conference with the likes of Clackamas and Nelson.\nHowever, one game in, the Raiders showed some building blocks on making sure that win No. 1 isn’t the only one they get in 2024-2025.\n“It’s been crazy and I’ve just been waiting for this day,” Nelson said of joining the Reynolds program. “I knew what we could do based on our coaching scheme, and if we went out and executed I knew we could compete. It was nice to see it and to get them to believe even more and buy in even more so now they can see, oh, this does work.”",
