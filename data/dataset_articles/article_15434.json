  "text": "A child care facility operated by some of the University of Mary's faculty, students and licensed early childhood teachers is set to open in Bismarck next year in an effort to hep alleviate the shortage of licensed facilities in the area.\nThe Center for Early Learning is scheduled to open June 1 on South Seventh Street, replacing the Butler Center near the Kirkwood Mall. Renovations are being funded through a $464,000 grant provided by the North Dakota Department of Commerce.\nIt is anticipated to operate Mondays through Fridays from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\nThe center is expected to accommodate 70-80 children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years. Included within the facility will be one infant room, one toddler room, three classrooms for children ages 3-6, and a fenced-in playground.\nUniversity's Education Chair Kim Marman described the center as a place for students to observe and learn behaviors displayed across various children.\nPeople are also reading…\n\"Faculty members (will) mentor our students in creating care plans or behavior plans for children with special needs. This practical experience is invaluable, and our students will also be involved in internships, practicum experiences and student teaching,\" Marman said [in a statement](https://www.umary.edu/about/news/all-stories/university-mary-open-one-kind-early-childhood-facility-central-bismarck).\nThe Liffrig Family School of Education and Behavioral Sciences and the Saint Gianna School of Health Sciences will partner to operate the center. The facility will include a Montessori-inspired curriculum that is rooted in Christian, Catholic and Benedictine values, the statement said.\n\"Our goal is to create a model for what early childhood education can look like,\" Jennifer Barry, director of the center, said in the statement. \"Not only are we addressing a critical community need, but we're also ensuring that our students gain real-world experience that will help them become better educators and caregivers in the future.\"\nThe center also plans to participate in the [North Dakota Child Care Assistance Program](https://www.hhs.nd.gov/applyforhelp/ccap), which helps some families finance child care while parents work or attend school. To qualify, a household's monthly income must fall below the program's income limits. For example, a two-person household -- including adults and children -- can earn up to $5,231 per month, while an eight-person household can have a maximum monthly income of $10,617.\nWhy is child care hard to find and afford?\nOne reason child care is difficult to access for parents is the ongoing struggle to recruit and retain staff at local facilities, the [North Dakota News Cooperative](https://bismarcktribune.com/news/community/mandannews/affordable-accessible-housing-north-dakota-challenge-capable/article_c6b0d722-19e8-11ef-bf53-4bdb95cd821a.html) reported in May.\nThe problem is compounded by a high cost of child care. The U.S. Department of Labor in [January 2023](https://blog.dol.gov/2023/01/24/new-childcare-data-shows-prices-are-untenable-for-families) compared child care costs to paying a second rent, showing just how expensive it is. Depending on the child’s age and type of care, costs can range from around $5,000 to more than $17,000 a year, consuming 8-19% of a typical family’s income, the department said.\nThe state has implemented multiple initiatives to address child care challenges. The North Dakota Development Fund is investing more than $2.4 million in loans to day care facilities to aid in expansions or purchasing buildings, according to a Thursday announcement from the state Department of Commerce. There was also the launch of the Child Care Workforce Benefit in June, which helps parents employed in licensed child care programs pay for their own child care costs for children up to 12 years of age.\nFurther, the [ND Working Parents Child Care Relief Program](https://www.hhs.nd.gov/wpccr/employers) launched in March 2023 allows employers to opt into a cost-sharing initiative aimed at taking away some financial burden of child care for families with children under 3.",
