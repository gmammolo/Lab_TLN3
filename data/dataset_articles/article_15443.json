  "text": "MISHAWAKA — \"You had the people and now you have the support behind it,\" Penn varsity girls wrestling coach Amy Hildebrandt has been around the sport of wrestling her entire life. And she's thrilled to see her sport on the rise in Indiana, climbing from the club ranks to now in its inaugural season as an IHSAA-sanctioned sport. \"To see it in their eyes and their movement and how empowered they feel, how much they believe and how much they love working hard and being taken seriously and I just freaking love it,\" says Sarah Hildebrandt, the 2024 Paris Olympics gold medalist, as well as a Penn wrestling alum, and Amy's sister. \"It's amazing, but a little scary and nerve-wracking,\" says Janiah Juarez, a senior at Penn who's wrestled for three years. \"It’s still for fun but now it’s a little more serious. You get to say that you placed first at this IHSAA tournament.\" Experiences vary from Juarez, in her 3rd year wrestling, to others who joined the team this year on a whim. \"It’s made me better as a person,\" says senior Lilliah Schlabach, who's in her first season as a wrestler. \"It’s not about being good at this sport, but improving as a person and everything and I love it. Wrestling is a hard sport. A lot of girls are nervous to do it. I was. I think it’s great that we’re getting out there and building the confidence to be able to do that.\" That’s been one goal Penn Head Coach Amy Hildebrandt set out to achieve when she founded the Kingsmen’s girls’ wrestling club as a sophomore in 2011. \"It's elevated the whole sport in my opinion,\" Amy Hildebrandt tells WSBT 22. \"Boys wrestling, men’s wrestling, women’s wrestling, girls wrestling, all of it. It starts here at this level and this involvement. The fact that it’s now open and easily accessible to everyone, that's how you’re going to grow wrestling.\"",
