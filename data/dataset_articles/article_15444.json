  "text": "12/5/2024\nWith a background rooted in Illinois, where she completed her BS [BSME 2020], MS [MSME 2022], and PhD [PhD 2024], in mechanical engineering, Teaching Assistant Professor\n[Kellie Halloran](/people/profile/kellie2) brings a deep institutional understanding and an innovative perspective to the MechSE curriculum.\nHer path began as an Illinois undergraduate, and although she didn’t plan on staying for graduate studies her trajectory changed after she joined Associate Professor\n[Mariana Kersh’s](/people/profile/mkersh) research lab, immersing in health and bio-related research in her junior year. “Mariana was very patient with me as I learned about research and how to conduct it well, and I hope to treat my students with the same patience and encouragement,” she said. The experience inspired Halloran to continue into graduate school and eventually become a MechSE faculty member, committed to providing students with the same supportive environment.\nHalloran’s graduate research in bioengineering shaped her teaching philosophy, emphasizing critical thinking and problem-solving. Her research background allows her to connect theoretical content to real-world applications in the classroom, especially in courses like ME 170 (Computer-Aided Design), TAM 210/211 (Statics), and ENG 177 (Engineering First-Year Experience Seminar: Leadership). Teaching these courses holds meaning for Halloran—having taken ME 170 and TAM 210/211 herself, she has first-hand insight into their challenges.\nIn ME 170, she helps students navigate their first design project, guiding them step-by-step through the design process to build confidence. In TAM 210/211, she connects physics, math, and engineering principles to real-world applications, making abstract concepts more accessible and reinforcing students’ confidence in applying theory to practice. Her approach in ENG 177, which she taught as a graduate student, emphasized that while technical skills are essential, leadership and communication are equally critical in engineering. In this course, Halloran guided students in developing their unique leadership strengths, team-building skills, and collaborative approaches.\nChoosing a teaching-focused path instead of a traditional tenure-track role was a pivotal decision for Halloran, enabling her to prioritize hands-on, student-centered learning. She reflected that this choice allowed her to fully focus on helping students develop their understanding without the demands of research commitments. Her teaching philosophy centers on fostering creativity and problem-solving, recognizing that today’s complex challenges require innovative thinking.\n“As problems become more complex, more creative solutions are needed,” she explained, emphasizing that cultivating creativity in engineering students is just as essential as building technical skills.\nOne of Halloran’s goals is to incorporate more creativity-driven and design-based activities into MechSE courses. By working on real-world problems, she believes that students learn to address issues holistically, combining technical knowledge with creative thinking. To support this, she encourages students to explore, hypothesize, and iterate as they work through projects. Halloran continually refines her teaching approach, exploring methods to bridge theory and application, and is committed to keeping MechSE courses engaging and curiosity driven.\nLooking to the future, Halloran is excited about innovating within the MechSE curriculum. “I’m always looking for ways to make learning more interactive and engaging,” Halloran said. “Bringing in new technologies and active learning techniques allows students to connect with the material in meaningful ways, which is key to developing curiosity and critical thinking.” She aims to further integrate interactive, active learning techniques that make education more collaborative and engaging. Long-term, she hopes to contribute to course development and curriculum improvements, particularly by introducing interdisciplinary projects that blend engineering with design. Through these initiatives, Halloran supports MechSE’s mission to prepare students as adaptable, forward-thinking problem-solvers.\nShe understands that engineering can be challenging, especially for students new to the field, and encourages those struggling to reach out. “It’s okay to ask for help!” she advised. Reflecting on her own experience, Halloran recalled that attending office hours and asking questions helped her as a student.\nHer career thus far offers valuable insights to aspiring educators, showing that a teaching-focused role can be deeply fulfilling. Her journey underscores how teaching-centered faculty play a critical role in shaping students’ technical skills, confidence, and personal growth, leaving a lasting impact on future engineers.",
