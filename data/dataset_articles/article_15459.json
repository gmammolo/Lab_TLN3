  "text": "Colombo, Sri Lanka December 5, 2024 – This year, the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka proudly marks the 20th anniversary of the English Access Scholarship Programme (Access), a free, transformative initiative that has empowered over 1,300 Sri Lankan youth with English language skills, leadership development and cross-cultural connections since its inception.\nLaunched globally in 2004 by the U.S. Department of State, the Access Programme provides economically disadvantaged students aged 13 to 15 with a robust foundation in English language skills. Through its free, two-year 360-hour curriculum, Sri Lankan youth gain leadership training, professional development opportunities, and exposure to U.S. culture and democratic values.\nThese Access experiences open doors to better educational and career opportunities and prepare students to compete for future exchanges and study programmes in the United States.\n“Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the English Access Scholarship Programme in Sri Lanka is a testament to our enduring commitment to empowering youth through education,” said U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung. “This programme not only provides essential English language skills but also fosters leadership, professional development, and cross-cultural understanding. By bridging communities and creating opportunities for economically disadvantaged students, we are investing in a brighter, more inclusive future for all.”\nThe Access Programme doesn’t just transform students’ lives—it also strengthens English teaching in Sri Lanka and connects students to the global Access network and peers from all corners of the island. Access teachers get top-notch training and join a global Community of Practice, along with opportunities to attend national and regional conferences. Earlier this year, 34 Sri Lankan educators, coordinators, and alumni joined the 20th Anniversary Regional Summit in Kathmandu, Nepal.\n“The English Access Scholarship Programme has been a key part of how we’re expanding educational opportunities and building stronger ties between the United States and Sri Lanka,” said U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officer Heidi Hattenbach. “In a country rebuilding after conflict, Access has done so much more than teach English—it brings students and teachers together from diverse backgrounds, connects them to a global network, and gives them the skills and confidence to chase their dreams while fostering understanding and collaboration across communities.”\nAccess providers have emphasized connecting students from diverse backgrounds, using English as a bridge language. These bonds often transcend ethnic and religious differences, creating lifelong connections. As Mathangi, an Access alumna from Jaffna, shared, “Access transformed the way I connect with others, giving me the confidence to engage with people from diverse backgrounds and the skills to speak and present with clarity and self-assurance.”\nTo mark this 20th anniversary milestone, a four-day camp in Kandy will bring together 150 current Access students and teachers from Jaffna, Galle, Kurunegala, Trincomalee, and Nuwara Eliya. The event will feature interactive sessions led by Georgetown University-sponsored English Language Fellows, a community service project, and a “Culture Night” showcasing students’ unique experiences. Ambassador Julie Chung will join as a special guest, alongside other speakers.\nStarting with just 56 students from Sri Lanka’s Western Province, Access now boasts alumni from over 50 locations nationwide, including Kandy, home to the programme’s largest alumni cohort of 185. For the upcoming 2025-2027 cycle, the programme will enrol 150 new students from schools in Jaffna, Nuwara Eliya, Batticaloa, Ampara, Puttalam, and Ratnapura.\nThe U.S. Embassy and its local Access partners are proud to offer this free programme, continuing the legacy of enhancing English language and leadership skills and while cross-cultural connections in Sri Lanka and beyond.\nFor more information about U.S. initiatives in Sri Lanka, visit https://lk.usembassy.gov/ and follow @USEmbassySL on social media.",
