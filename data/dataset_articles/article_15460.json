  "text": "Opportunity to ‘redefine ourselves’: Board OKs recommendations for community college system McKenna Horsley Thu, December 5, 2024 at 10:21 PM UTC 3 min read\nThe Kentucky Community and Technical College System is made up of 16 colleges across Kentucky. Its headquarters, above, is in Versailles. (KCTCS photo)\nVERSAILLES — The Kentucky Community and Technical College System Board of Regents approved 11 recommendations for changes to the system in response to a directive earlier this year from the state legislature.\nRyan Quarles (KCTCS photo) The recommendations include changes to KCTCS’ governance, making the system the sole provider of dual credit courses in Kentucky and evaluating areas for possible mergers and consolidations.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Senate Joint Resolution 179 , passed by the General Assembly earlier this year, directed KCTCS to review and report findings on ways to improve the functionally of the two-year college system. The legislature set a Dec. 10 deadline for the report. The 11 recommendations will be presented to lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Education next week.\nKCTCS President Ryan Quarles described the meeting to discuss the recommendations as an opportunity for the college system to “redefine ourselves.”\nThe 11 recommendations are:\nStrengthen academic training and program offerings.\nEstablish a comprehensive KCTCS workforce plan that may include financial and academic supports, career counseling and experiential learning elements.\nEvaluate KCTCS’ geographical footprint, including the need for merger and consolidations.\nPreserve college-level accreditation and focus on shared services and integration across KCTCS.\nReform KCTCS governance, including the makeup of the Board of Regents.\nRecommend a 100% outcomes-based funding model for KCTCS if the legislature will set KCTCS’ state appropriations at or above the average rate of comparable states.\nExpand credential eligibility and funding for the Work Ready Scholarship.\nMake no changes to the KCTCS personnel system.\nKCTCS should be the sole provider of dual credit in Kentucky. Dual credit allows high school students to take college-level courses and earn college credit.\nAddress transferability of associate degrees to four-year institutions.\nRepeal outdated language and statutes in state law.\nQuarles became president of KCTCS in January amid concerns raised by several reviews, audits and studies. KCTCS released findings from a forensic audit in November, which found no fraud or criminal behavior but a need to improve internal policies and procedures.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Findings from a Huron Consulting Group study and audits were part of the foundation for the General Assembly’s resolution calling on KCTCS to examine itself. That legislation was carried by Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester.\nWhile presenting the recommendations to the board, Quarles, a former Kentucky agriculture commissioner and Republican state representative, recalled his own legislative experience. He emphasized that the 11 points were merely recommendations.\n“It is rare to have a piece of legislation where you agree with 100% of what’s in it,” Quarles said. “So, I’m asking you to do something that can transform this organization.”\nBefore the board voted on the recommendations, board Secretary Brianna Sanders Whitten made a motion to vote separately on the recommended changes to KCTCS’ governance, but the motion failed. The full recommendation includes changing the terms of appointed board members to four years instead of six with the chance to be reappointed.\nAdvertisement Advertisement More in U.S. Passenger stinks up entire plane with ‘diabolical’ in-flight meal choice: ‘Scented food is a crime’ NY Post Cops Close in on Grinning Suspect in UnitedHealthcare CEO’s Murder as They Probe Gun Purchase The Daily Beast Massive lottery jackpot is set to expire.

A motion hour will be held in the case next week — after the legislature’s education committee meeting.\nThe board went behind closed doors during Thursday’s meeting for a 45-minute executive session to discuss proposed or pending litigation.\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 14,762 people played the daily Crossword recently.
