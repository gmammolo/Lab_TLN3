  "text": "Men's Tennis 12/5/2024 12:54:00 PM Pascual to Join TCU Men's Tennis in January Incoming freshman boasts a career-high ITF world juniors ranking of No. 59 FORT WORTH – The future of TCU men's tennis is steadily forming, as Roger Pascual is set to join the Horned Frogs 2024-25 roster as a freshman in January. Pascual, from Vinaros, Spain, boasts a career-high ITF world juniors ranking of No. 59. He has won seven combined juniors titles, including five in 2022. A left-handed player, Pascual signed with TCU as a high school junior in November of 2023. He has competed in M25 and M15 level tournaments in Europe throughout the summer and fall seasons ahead of his arrival in Fort Worth. Pascual is one of two newcomers and four Spaniards on the Horned Frogs' 2024-25 roster. He joins fellow freshmen Albert Pedrico Kravtsov of Barcelona and countrymen Julian Alonso and Pedro Vives on the purple courts. Five of Pascual's ITF juniors titles have come in singles. He won the J4 Les Franqueses del Valles, J3 Barcelona, J3 El Prat De Llobregat and J3 Vic during the 2022 season. Pascual triumphed in doubles the 2023 J200 Renningen.Rutesheim for his highest-level championship. He accumulated a 123-58 combined overall juniors record before transitioning to pro-level events. Pascual advanced to the quarterfinals or farther in three tournaments this summer. He was a doubles semifinalist and singles quarterfinalist at the M25 Roda de Bara and enjoyed a quarterfinal run in doubles at the M25 Cordoba in June. TCU opens the 2025 dual season on Jan 10 vs. Abilene Christian.
