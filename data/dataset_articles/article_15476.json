  "text": "New lock feature for EBT cards, app announced for Georgia SNAP recipients\nATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Georgians who rely on the state’s food stamp program will now have an extra layer of security, the Georgia Department of Human Services (DHS) announced Thursday.\nDHS said a new feature allows EBT cardholders to easily lock and unlock their cards between purchases. Recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits can access the locking feature through the [existing ConnectEBT website](https://www.connectebt.com/ebtconnect/recipient/GA/) or by using a new ConnectEBT app.\nGeorgia is one of 14 states to offer the new app and one of several to include the card-locking feature, DHS said.\nThe lock feature lets customers choose where their cards are locked – either everywhere (including Georgia) or only outside Georgia. Customers can also use the ConnectEBT app to automatically lock their cards after a specific amount of time.\nCustomers can download the ConnectEBT app on their Android or Apple device from their device’s app store. Once the app is installed, customers can register a new account or log in using their ConnectEBT website username and password.\nFor more information or help with the ConnectEBT app or website, customers can call the customer service line at 1-888-421-3281.\n[Atlanta News First recently reported](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/10/23/skimming-hack-targeting-georgia-food-stamp-recipients-state-agency-says/) that DHS has been dealing with thousands of reports of stolen EBT funds dating back to 2023. The department said the fraud is believed to be tied to card skimming and cloning, resulting in nearly $3 million in replacement food stamps.\nCopyright 2024 WANF. All rights reserved.",
