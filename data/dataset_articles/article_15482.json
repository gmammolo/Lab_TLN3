  "text": "The Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows Program is pleased to announce the selection of its inaugural laureates: Dr. Cynthia A. Adinortey (Ghana) and Dr. Antony Otinga Oteng’o (Kenya).\n“We had many excellent applicants from across Sub-Saharan Africa. Ultimately, our Selection Committee selected these two exemplary scholars, and we are most happy with the result,” said Dr. William Cheung, professor and Director of UBC’s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries (IOF), which administers the Program. “These two exemplary scholars will now have the opportunity to collaborate with researchers at UBC, access the vast resources available here, and create insights that will benefit their universities, their countries, and the world.”\nThe Africa-UBC Visiting Fellows Program came about as the brainchild of Drs Rashid Sumaila and Daniel Pauly, co-winners of the 2023 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. These professors, both of African descent, have been working with scholars from that continent for many years and felt there were too few opportunities for talented early-career academics from sub-Saharan African universities and research institutes to participate in mutually beneficial research collaborations and build international networks. This Program was developed with the assistance of the University of Cape Coast.\n“The University of Cape Coast is proud to support the Fellows Program, which strengthens the collaboration between African researchers and global academic communities,” said Professor Denis W. Aheto, Professor of Coastal Ecology and Director of the Centre for Coastal Management, The Africa Centre of Excellence in Coastal Resilience (ACECoR), University of Cape Coast. “It is vital that we continue to foster these partnerships to address the challenges facing Africa’s oceans and fisheries, ensuring sustainable solutions for future generations.”\n“Rashid and I have strived to work on a global basis, with emphasis on the Global South, and build connections with researchers across all continents,” Dr. Pauly, the Sea Around Us principal investigator, said. “Welcoming Drs. Adinortey and Oteng’o in Vancouver, through the Africa-UBC Oceans & Fisheries Fellowship, will strengthen our ongoing collaboration with African scholars and, ultimately, support efforts towards the conservation and sustainable management of the continent’s marine and freshwater resources.”\n“The Program is open to researchers across all academic fields, who are focused on ocean sustainability and making the ocean economy work for the people who call Africa home”, said Dr. Sumaila. The selected fellows are affiliated with a faculty member at UBC for 12 months – 11 months of virtual engagement, with a month-long visit to UBC’s Vancouver campus. The total value of each fellowship is CAD 23,000, which covers Fellow and UBC counterpart research funds, the cost of air ticket, accommodation and subsistence during the Fellows’ UBC visit, etc.\nThe Laureates\nDr. Cynthia Adinortey is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Cape Coast (UCC) in Ghana, whose research focuses on bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, with particular attention to food safety and the fisheries value chain, using the One Health collaborative, transdisciplinary approach. She led a USAID/UCC project on antibiotic resistance in Ghana’s aquaculture sector and has actively participated in anti-microbial resistance (AMR) awareness efforts as an AMR Insight Ambassador. She was elected an African Academy of Sciences Affiliate in 2022. Since 2017, she has worked with key stakeholders in Ghana’s fisheries sector, providing microbiology expertise on major projects, including research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in fish, the Healthier Smoked Fish Certification Scheme under USAID’s Sustainable Fisheries Management Program (SFMP) and the development of the Safe Fish Certification Scheme with Feed the Future Ghana Fisheries Recovery Activity (GFRA).\n“I am very excited and honoured to be chosen as one of the two inaugural Fellows of the Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Fellowship Program, and to work on specific research related to the identification of indicator organisms for disease diagnosis in Ghanaian aquaculture,” said Dr. Adinortey. “This research has the potential to improve aquaculture disease management, enhance productivity, and contribute to the sustainability of the aquaculture industry in Ghana.”\nDr. Antony Otinga Oteng’o is a Young Career Scientist, Lecturer and Coordinator of the post-graduate program at the Department of Biological Sciences & Agriculture, University of Eastern Africa, Baraton, Kenya (UEAB). With a background in molecular biology and marine plant phylogeny, Dr. Oteng’o’s research interest focuses on species identification, evolutionary relationships, and the critical role that phylogenetic studies play in informing conservation strategies.\n“My fellowship project is entitled, Enhancing Marine Ecosystems and Coastal Communities in Majoreni, South Coast Kenya, is a biodiversity conservation initiative,” said Dr. Oteng’o. Mangroves are vital to the health of coastal ecosystems, serving as nurseries for many marine species, protecting shorelines from erosion, and sequestering significant amounts of carbon. However, these critical habitats are under threat from anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change. “By assessing the current state of mangrove forests along the Kenyan coast, I hope to identify the key challenges they face and develop strategies for their restoration, management and conservation. The intended outcomes are improved food security, reduced coastal climate impacts, improved carbon credit, and increased biodiversity.”\nDr. Oteng’o adds that “the project will also explore apiculture (or beekeeping) as a sustainable alternative livelihood for the Majoreni community. Apiculture could not only provide a source of income to the local economy, through the production of honey and other bee products but will also support biodiversity by promoting pollination.”\nAppealing to future applicants\n“I am truly grateful to have been selected for this unique opportunity to contribute to addressing one of Africa’s most pressing challenges: ensuring food security through sustainable aquaculture,” said Dr. Adinortey. “I encourage all young African scientists in ocean and fisheries research to watch for the next call for applications and seize the opportunity to explore how the ocean economy can be harnessed to benefit not only Africans but the world as a whole.”\nDr. Oteng’o concurs. “To aspiring applicants, I encourage them to embrace the opportunity to grow, learn and make a difference by applying to the program. I am confident that the Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows program will provide me with the tools, support, and inspiration needed to achieve my research goals and contribute to the broader scientific community.”\nNow accepting applications\nThe Africa-UBC Oceans and Fisheries Visiting Fellows program has opened applications for its 2025 cohort.\nInformation on the program, its criteria and how to enter can be found at https://oceans.ubc.ca/applytoafricaubcprogram/. The deadline for applications is May 15, 2024.",
