  "text": "The artwork titled “St. Francis Honoured by a Simple Man” was created by Giotto in the year 1300. This fresco, a significant work from the Proto Renaissance art movement, measures 270 x 230 cm. It belongs to the series “Legend of St Francis” and is classified under the genre of religious painting. The masterpiece is currently housed in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, located in Assisi, Italy.\nThe artwork depicts St. Francis being honored by a humble individual, highlighting the virtue of humility associated with the saint. The composition features architectural elements reminiscent of classical structures, situating the scene in a serene and reverent setting. The saint is distinguished by his halo, which signifies his sanctity, and he is surrounded by figures dressed in contemporary attire, enhancing the narrative’s accessibility. Rich in detail and imbued with a sense of piety, this fresco is an exemplary piece of Giotto’s innovative approach to capturing human emotion and spirituality.",
