  "text": "No. 9 Indiana football signed each of its 21 verbal commitments Wednesday, which marked the first of two National Signing Day’s in the college football calendar. The Hoosiers have the 43rd-best recruiting class in the nation, according to 247Sports , with 20 3-star recruits and 4-star safety Byron Baldwin comprising the Big Ten’s 13th-best class. Indiana head coach Curt Cignetti said during his press conference Wednesday that 14 of the 21 signees will be early enrollees, joining the team for winter workouts and spring practice. The other seven will arrive for summer workouts. The Hoosiers added nine players on offense and 12 on defense, and 13 of their newcomers live within roughly a four-hour radius of Bloomington. While not highly ranked compared to its peers, Cignetti said he likes Indiana’s recruiting class. “Good players, good people, good character, good students,” Cignetti said. “This game is all about recruiting and development and then retention. Keeping the guys that eventually produce. So excited about them.” The Hoosiers added players at every position except for quarterback. Sixth-year senior starter Kurtis Rourke is out of eligibility after this season, leaving Indiana with uncertainty under center. Cignetti said he likes true freshmen quarterbacks Tyler Cherry and Alberto Mendoza and thus didn’t feel the need to recruit another. The Hoosiers also have redshirt sophomore Tayven Jackson, who’s currently Rourke’s backup. Yet even with three signal callers slated to return, Cignetti will pursue a quarterback once the transfer portal opens Dec. 9. Indiana, with its entire high school recruiting class finalized, will now turn its attention fully toward the transfer market. Cignetti noted some players — those who attend schools that have already fired their head coaches — are in the portal already, and the Hoosiers’ coaching staff has paid attention to other players who have announced their transfer intentions on social media. Cignetti also said he’s had a few conversations with current players about returning for next season, all the while scripting and coaching practices from Wednesday through Friday. “I want our team to focus right now on — we're in season, and the main thing has to be the main thing,” Cignetti said. “You guys all know that today has to be a great day and a great meeting and all that stuff that we preach.” Indiana’s attention is, at least mostly, on the present — and an expected trip to the College Football Playoff. But the Hoosiers are also focused on building a sustained contender, ensuring 2024 isn’t a one-year wonder. Cignetti, with the recruiting class he and his staff have assembled, doesn’t think it will be. “I think these guys all have a chance,” Cignetti said, “and we're excited about them.” Indiana’s full 21-player recruiting class: - Safety Byron Baldwin - Defensive end Tyrone Burrus Jr. - Defensive end Triston Abram - Wide receiver Davion Chandler - Tight end Blake Thiry - Cornerback Seaonta Stewart - Cornerback Jaylen Bell - Running back Sean Cuono - Wide receiver LeBron Bond - Defensive tackle Jhrevious Hall - Offensive lineman Baylor Wilkin - Linebacker Jamari Farmer - Wide receiver Myles Kendrick - Defensive end Keishaun Calhoun - Offensive lineman Evan Parker - Linebacker Paul Nelson - Defensive tackle Kyler Garcia - Tight end Andrew Barker - Cornerback Zacharey Smith - Offensive line Matt Marek - Safety Garrett Reese Follow reporters Daniel Flick ( @ByDanielFlick ) and Dalton James ( @DaltonMJames ) and columnist Jhett Garrett ( @jhettgarrett ) for updates throughout the Indiana football season.",
