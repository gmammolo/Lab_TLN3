  "text": "SIA-India, a not-for-profit association representing the space industry, has partnered with Protoplanet, a Bengaluru-based organisation focused on space and climate research, to promote astrobiology, planetary sciences, microgravity and climate studies across universities and research institutes in India. The two organisations signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) during the Indo-Pacific Space and Earth Conference (IPSEC) 2024, held in Western Australia.\nThe MoU was formalised between Dr. Subba Rao Pavuluri, President of SIA-India and Dr. Siddharth Pandey, Director of Protoplanet, in the presence of key dignitaries including Amarjeet Singh Takhi, Consul General of India in Western Australia and Anil Prakash, Director General of SIA-India. The collaboration seeks to bolster India's space research ecosystem while fostering international cooperation across the Indo-Pacific region.\nUnder the agreement, the two organisations will collaborate on interdisciplinary research projects, focusing on areas such as microgravity studies, planetary sciences, space robotics and terrestrial analogues. The partnership also aims to strengthen capacity building by organising joint workshops, specialised training sessions and platforms for knowledge sharing. This initiative is expected to bridge the gap between academia and industry, encouraging innovation and the commercialisation of space technologies.\nCommenting on the partnership, Dr. Subba Rao Pavuluri stated that the MoU represents a structured effort to enhance India’s space innovation ecosystem. Dr. Siddharth Pandey added that the collaboration aims to empower students and researchers, providing them with the tools and platforms needed to contribute to India's growing space sector.\nProtoplanet, which operates as a network of international experts providing education and training in climate and space exploration, will contribute its expertise to advance the MoU’s objectives. Meanwhile, SIA-India will leverage its influence in policy advocacy to promote a supportive framework for research and global partnerships. The collaboration is set to run until the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in 2028, allowing ample time to establish a sustainable model for academic and industry synergy in space exploration.\nShare Also Read",
