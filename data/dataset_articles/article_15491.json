  "text": "Armenpress Documenting the Century photo exhibition has opened in Vanadzor.The exhibition showcases a wide range of historical moments, from sports and cultural achievements to significant political developments, visits by world-famous figures, the construction of historical and cultural monuments, and key events from Soviet Armenia. It provides an opportunity to revisit and relive the most important moments and unforgettable episodes that took place in Armenia during the 20th century.The exhibition, which will be open until December 28 at the Vanadzor Museum of Fine Arts, allows visitors to reflect on these milestones in history.At the opening of the exhibition, Haykuhi Avagyan, Director of the Vanadzor Museum of Fine Arts, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing gratitude for hosting the Armenpress Documenting the Century photo exhibition in Vanadzor.In her speech, Narine Nazaryan, Director of the Armenpress State News Agency, highlighted that the exhibition features photographs documenting memorable and significant events of the last century.\"Our exhibition was initially created for the 105th anniversary of Armenpress to raise public awareness of our heritage. In addition to Yerevan, it was shown in Gyumri and Kapan. The next stop is Vanadzor. We are ready to present this exhibition in other regions to provide a larger audience the opportunity to explore the key events of the last century, recall our path, celebrate our glorious sports victories, and reflect on visits by high-ranking foreign officials to Armenia. Today, I also consider it symbolic that a section is dedicated to the devastating Spitak earthquake, which also serves as a tribute to its anniversary,\" Narine Nazaryan emphasized.Speaking about the thematic directions of the archival photographs, Narine Nazaryan noted that around 80 works are included, showcasing a diverse range of topics.\"Our exhibition also includes photos from film sets. Some of our favorite actors are represented. Vanadzor is featured with a unique story. We have a photo in the exhibition that, when we first included it, we wondered how the public would react. But I was confident it was a winning one. It tells the very unique story of the process of lowering down a car assembled on a roof. The process of finding the truth about this photo took us to Vanadzor, where we met people who witnessed the event.\"We learned what really happened, who the engineer was who decided to assemble a car from scratch on a roof, and how it was lowered. We hope that one day, the news agency will also present the history of this photo with a beautiful story,\" Director of Armenpress explained. SectionCulture",
