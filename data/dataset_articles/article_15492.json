  "text": "Transylvania University has appointed Erin Craig as its new senior vice president for enrollment management. Craig will begin her role on Monday, Dec. 9.\n“I am excited to welcome Erin Craig to the Transylvania family,” said President Brien Lewis. “Her experience in higher education enrollment management, coupled with her proven track record, will be invaluable as we work to build upon our success in attracting Kentucky’s top students to our campus.”\nCraig served in leadership roles at several institutions, including Christian Brothers University in Tennessee, Aquinas College in Michigan and the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. She also worked in admissions at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and at her alma mater, New York’s LeMoyne College, where she earned a bachelor’s in business administration and finance and a master’s in general education.\nMost recently, Craig worked in senior leadership at 3 Enrollment Marketing, where she advised institutions on comprehensive enrollment management strategies.\n“I am honored and privileged to be joining the Transylvania University community as the senior vice president for enrollment management,” Craig said. “Under the leadership and care of President Lewis, the Board of Trustees and the members of senior leadership, I look forward to supporting the vision and mission of the university.\n“From the outset, I was captivated by the sense of greatness that permeates Transylvania,” she added. “I am excited to contribute to the implementation of the [new strategic plan](https://www.transy.edu/about/office-of-the-president/strategic-plan-2030/) and to foster strong relationships with key constituents throughout the university and greater Lexington. I am eager to roll up my sleeves and get to work.”\nTransylvania University, located in the heart of downtown Lexington, Kentucky, is a top-ranked private liberal arts college featuring a community-driven, personalized approach to a liberal arts education. Founded in 1780, it is Kentucky’s first college and the 16th oldest institution of higher learning in the country, with approximately 1,000 students.",
