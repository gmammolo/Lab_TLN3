Following the tragic loss of his mother in a racially motivated mass shooting, Chris transformed his grief into a mission to inspire others. He has since become a best-selling author and sought-after speaker, sharing his powerful message of unity and racial reconciliation with NFL and NBA teams, as well as various Fortune 500 companies across the nation. His experiences and insights resonate deeply, encouraging audiences to reflect on the importance of empathy and understanding.”\nIn his book, “Your Life Matters,” the library says Singleton empowers and validates Black children by reassuring them that, no matter what they hear or experience, their lives truly matter.\nAdmission is free, with tickets available at [warrenpl.org.](https://warrenpl.org/)",
