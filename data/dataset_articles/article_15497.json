  "text": "Vanderbilt University School of Medicine’s Academy for Excellence in Clinical Medicine (AECM) has selected 25 new members.\nThe AECM was formed in 2021 to “honor exemplary clinicians who combine humanism, professionalism and a passion for patient care with a scholarly approach to improving patient health and establish a community of leaders to promote clinical excellence.” In addition to receiving this recognition, members in the Academy are expected to give back to the institution. Academy members act as mentors, giving presentations on professionalism and leading discussions with caregivers on how to help elevate patient care throughout the Medical Center.\nThe AECM selection committee chose the new members based on the nominees’ CVs, their personal philosophy regarding clinical excellence as it pertains to their practices, and their letters of support. AECM members undergo a rigorous, multistep vetting process with the following steps:\n- Calls for nominations were sent to all VUMC-employed faculty members via email with a description of the Academy’s mission and the eligibility criteria, along with a link to a REDCap survey to nominate faculty.\n- Faculty who received three independent nominations through the REDCap survey were vetted by the Office of Faculty and Medical Staff Engagement to ensure that they met all academy membership criteria.\n- Eligible faculty were invited to submit a full nomination package, which included their CV, a personal philosophy regarding clinical excellence as it pertains to their practice, as well as references from peers, learners, staff, and patients and families.\n- Nomination packets were reviewed by two current AECM members.\nA reception to celebrate the members is planned for early 2025.\nThe AECM is led by an elected steering committee that currently consists of Alison Herndon, MD, MSPH, associate professor of clinical Pediatrics, David Parra, MD, professor of Pediatrics, and Shilpa Reddy, MD, associate professor of Pediatrics. The academy’s executive sponsors are Maureen Gannon, PhD, professor of Medicine and associate dean for Faculty Development, Rick Wright, MD, professor and chair of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chief Medical Officer and Senior Vice President for Clinical Affairs, and Cecelia Theobald, MD, MPH, associate professor of Medicine, chief of staff for Corporate Clinical Affairs and Senior Vice President for Clinical Affairs.\nThe 25 faculty to be inducted into the AECM in 2024 include:\nRajiv Agarwal, MD, Department of Medicine\nKelly Bennett, MD, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nRobel Beyene, MD, Department of Surgery\nKatharine Boyle, MD, Department of Pediatrics\nKimberly Brown, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\nChristina Fiske, MD, Department of Medicine\nAnthony Gamboa, MD, Department of Medicine\nPaula Herrmann, MD, Department of Medicine\nMerranda Holmes, MD, Department of Medicine\nTamarya Hoyt, MD, Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences\nMichael Johnston, MD, Department of Emergency Medicine\nAnn Kavanaugh-McHugh, MD, Department of Pediatrics\nZachary Kohutek, MD, PhD, Department of Radiation Oncology\nHeather Kreth, PsyD, Department of Pediatrics\nStephanie Kurita, MD, Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences\nAmy Luckenbaugh, MD, Department of Urology\nLetha Mathews, MBBS, Department of Anesthesiology\nKelvin Moses, MD, PhD, Department of Urology\nRishi Naik, MD, Department of Medicine\nDhyanesh Patel, MD, Department of Medicine\nSoha Patel, MD, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nSiddharama Pawate, MBBS, Department of Neurology\nGregory Plemmons, MD, Department of Pediatrics\nCarmen Tuchman, MD, Department of Medicine\nKatie White, MD, PhD, Department of Medicine",
