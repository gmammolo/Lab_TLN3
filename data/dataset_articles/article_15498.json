They are also an ideal option for guest bedrooms or holiday homes, where ceilings are high but the floor space is small.\nThe right combination of features transforms bunk beds into elegant sleeping spaces. The bunks in this ocean themed bedroom were painted with Porter's Paints 'Mariner', which was a perfect match for the room's color scheme.\nSpace-Saving\nBunk beds are perfect for accommodating an entire family or two kids in the same space. They reduce space by stacking a bed frame over another. This configuration allows for more floor space that can be used for furniture or play. It is ideal for smaller rooms or lofted spaces that require more sleeping arrangements. Bunk beds come in a wide range of styles. From modern, sleek metal designs to classic wooden designs. Many also feature an integrated staircase that reduces the footprint of the structure. A spiral staircase is a fantastic alternative for those with a small bedroom. An integrated set of steep steps is perfect for homes with a limited space in storage space.\nBunk beds can add to a room's aesthetic, too, if you choose the right color palette and styling. Neutral colors such as light grey and navy are stylish choices for bunk beds. If you want to add a bit of design, you can dress up the neutral colour scheme with themed decor. For instance a bunk room that is with a theme of adventure could be designed to look like a forest hideout or a space inspired by clouds. If you're seeking to add a bit of colour, pick brighter colors for the top bunk, and lighter shades for the bottom bunks.\nIf you are building a bunk-room from scratch, it is important to be aware of the impact of the layout of the space. Use blue painter's adhesive to mark the outline of your bunk beds on the wall and then take measurements of the distance between the beds as well as any fixed elements like windows, closets, and doors. This will give you an idea of how close the bed will be to other furniture and will help you select the right size frame for your space.\nOnce you've picked the design of your bunk you like, think about adding other features that are functional. Ms. Keenan, for example often puts an reading lamp with a switch on each bunk. It's a great way for kids to read in peace without disturbing the person in front of them. She also includes a small shelf in each bunk where children can put glasses or books.\nComfortable Climbing\nEven the most adventurous children will be able to sleep high if climbing up and down it feels difficult or unsafe. \"The most important thing to do is ensure that the bunk bed is equipped with an erect ladder that is attached to the bunk's side,\" says interior designer Brynne Flowers, the founder of John Martine in Salt Lake City. They aren't as space-efficient, but they're the safest option for children who are young.\nThe most secure option is a fixed ladder that has simple rungs that are attached to the side of the bed. The ladders that are angled, which can be more attainable than straight ones, may be more suitable for older kids and teens. Test the bunk using blue painter's tape. Check to see if there is enough room to walk around.\nAnother great option is a built-in staircase that attaches to the bottom bunk or runs under each mattress on the top and lower levels. They are the largest and safest, however they take longer to set up than an individual ladder. \"Look for stairs that have wide, solid railings for stairways and an angled, low step,\" advises child safety expert Dr. Moriarty, who also recommends that bunk beds be supported by wood slats rather than wire or thin boards to avoid accidents.\nIf you are looking for a bunk that can develop with children, search for one that has an adjustable trundle. This will allow you to have a twin bed in your room for sleepovers, guests or other occasions without occupying any extra space. A trundle can only be used if the bottom bunk of your room is a twin.\nFenton and Alex Morris both love the Oeuf Perch Bunk. It is a modern choice that can be transformed into a loft or it can also be used as a twin bed. It's the largest option on our list, however Fenton calls it \"a tank\" that's \"built to last.\" The sleek design looks elegant and doesn't feel childish for teens and the beds can be separated if children decide that they don't require a bunk anymore.\nFlexibility\nThere are plenty of options when it comes to creating bunk beds. If you're designing a kid's room, primary bedroom, or guest room you can easily make these beds look stylish without sacrificing function. Bunk beds can be an attractive focal point in a room, create an imaginative playspace or act as a fun storage solution. Depending on\n[best bunk beds for small rooms bunkbedsstore](https://www.bunkbedsstore.uk/)going for, your bunk beds can be a standout piece that can be a part of your entire design scheme.\nBunk beds are available in a range of styles, finishes, colors and materials. In fact, a variety of bunks are available in designs that range from bohemian, the beach and even moody. Choose a color scheme or fabric and combine it with curtains, pillows and artwork to create your children's bedroom the look of a bunk bed that fits their personality.\nThe ladder on a bunk bed can make a huge difference in the way the room appears. Most bunk beds have a fixed ladder. However, some beds can be ordered with the ladder either side of the short end. Bunks that have the ladder positioned on the short end leave the lower bunk unopened and is perfect for adults and can provide the room a minimalist appearance.\nThink about a bunk bed in an unusual shape, not typical, like an L-shaped one. They take up less area and are perfect for rooms with low ceilings, notes Gil. They can also come with a desk beneath and can be a great choice for kids who want to study in bed.\nYou can also opt for an individual built bunk with stairs built into the frame. These bunks are typically used in hotels and are the most \"grown-up' option available. They're incredibly sturdy and are available in a variety of colors from Room & Board.\nIf you're looking for a more temporary solution, there are also convertible bunks that can convert from twin-over-twin beds into full-size beds and reverse. These can be a good option for older siblings who don't wish to share their rooms or parents who have to accommodate guests.\nStores\nBunk beds can offer plenty of space for clothing and bedding according to their design. Choose designs that incorporate drawers or shelving that are built into the structure or add standalone units to either side of the bunks. These are especially useful in small rooms as they maximize the unused space and don't make the bunks feel unorganized or cramped.\nSome manufacturers have built-in storage within the bed, like this Oeuf Perch loft that has two large storage compartments on each side of the upper level. These designs are perfect for siblings who share a bedroom, as they allow each child to keep their personal belongings close to hand while avoiding the dreaded \"piles\" of belongings shared.\nIn addition to drawers or shelves, other clever bunk bed ideas are to incorporate storage in the headboards. Baskets or bins placed at the end of the headboards allow you to reach books, which makes reading before bedtime more enjoyable. This option also works well in shared bedrooms, as children can keep their favourite books organized and easily accessible.\nA ladder can be integrated into the bunks. This removes the need for a separate furniture piece and creates a more sleek appearance. It's important to remember that angled ladders can be difficult for young children to climb. This type of bunk bed is usually reserved for older children or teens.\nBunk beds are an excellent option for any space, including attics or bonus rooms with unusual shapes. In these rooms the custom-built bunk bed could be the best option for creating a functional and stylish bunk room. If you're planning on building a bunk from scratch consider the height of the ceiling and the space above it. A higher ceiling allows for a larger bunk, while a lower ceiling will restrict the dimensions of the bunk.\nThe ideal bunk bed for a child is contingent on their age. However the bunk bed could be a great option for adults who wish to save some space and add a touch of elegance to a guest bedroom. This stylish bunk from Max & Lily is available in a variety of finishes. It can be divided into a twin-size bed and a full-size bed, which means it's an alternative to conventional bedroom furniture.",
