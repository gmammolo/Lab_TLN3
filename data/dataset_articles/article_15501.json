  "text": "UMary to open a Center for Early Learning, renovate Butler Center\nBISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Finding childcare is a challenge for many families in Bismarck. To help fulfill this need, the University of Mary was awarded a grant from the Department of Commerce to renovate the Butler Center on South 7th Street into a licensed childcare center and preschool and open in June of next year.\nThe Liffrig Family School of Education and Behavioral Sciences and the Saint Gianna School of Health Sciences students will get hands-on experience providing resources like language pathology and occupational therapy to children.\nThe facility accommodates 70 to 80 children aged eight weeks to age 12.\nThe program will offer a Montessori-inspired curriculum with Christian, Catholic and Benedictine values.\n“Research shows that licensed care capacity is meeting about 21% of the demand for childcare. So that leaves so many parents and families really struggling to find alternative options,” said Jennifer Barry, director of the Butler Center for Early Learning.\nThe Center for Early Learning will participate in the North Dakota Child Care Assistance Program.\nMore information about the University of Mary Center for Early Learning can be found on their website.\nCopyright 2024 KFYR.
