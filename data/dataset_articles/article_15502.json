  "text": "By Richard Everett ,\n3 hours ago\nTROY, Ala (WDHN) — High school students wanting to take dual enrollment courses at Troy University can do so at a lower price in 2025.\nAccording to Troy University, beginning in January 2025, dual enrollment classes for in-state students will be $33 per credit hour, down from $145.\nThese courses are available to students in the 10th, 11th, and 12th grades and homeschool and private school students from regionally accredited high schools with a GPA of 3.0 or higher.\nStudents wanting to take part in the courses need at least a 20 on the ACT, a 1030 on the SAT, or a letter of recommendation from a high school administrator to apply.\n“Troy University is enhancing access to higher education for high school students by offering affordable college-level courses,” said Sohail Agboatwala, Senior Vice Chancellor of Student Services and Administration. “This initiative gives students a valuable head start on their academic journey, allowing them to save time and money as they work toward their degrees. By prioritizing accessibility and quality, TROY reaffirms its dedication to empowering learners and building stronger connections with our communities.”\nAll Alabama students qualify for the in-state tuition, and students in specific Florida and Georgia counties.\nFlorida counties:\nBay Holmes Jackson Okaloosa Walton Calhoun Gulf Escambia Santa Rosa Georgia counties:\nEarly Seminole Baker Calhoun Chattahoochee Clay Decatur Harris Heard Macon Marion Meriweather Miller Muscogee Quitman Randolph Schley Stewart Talbot Terrell Troup Upson Webster Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
