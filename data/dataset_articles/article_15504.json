  "text": "Good news is coming from the education sector. Romanian students' math results are improving, said Education Minister Ligia Deca, after the launch of the results of the international study on the competencies of 4th and 8th grade students in math and science - TIMSS 2023. The study was conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), which launched the international report Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2023), conducted in Romania by the University of Bucharest with funding from the Ministry of Education. According to Minister Ligia Deca: \"Romanian students' results in mathematics are improving. The significant progress of fourth-grade students is encouraging, but in the medium term it is important to increase the proportion of those who reach a more advanced level of competence. At the same time, the study confirms that we need to invest more in mathematics and science education in middle school. Resilience scholarships, the National Program for Reducing School Dropout (PNRAS), the Remedial Learning program and teacher training for functional literacy will show their fruits in the next edition of the TIMSS study. Mathematics and science education is essential for the future of our young people and Romania\". According to TIMSS 2023, the skills of fourth-grade students have improved significantly in the last 12 years in both mathematics and science. The study for the 4th grade included 58 countries and 5 reference regions, and in Romania the data were collected from a sample of 130 schools, 156 primary education teachers and 3,559 4th grade students. Thus, Romanian students obtained 542 points, 39 points above the international average (503 points). The average score obtained by Romanian students in mathematics in 2023 is 60 points higher than the score obtained in 2011. Regarding the distribution by performance levels, 94% of Romanian students reach at least the minimum level of proficiency, and 16% of them obtain a score that places them at the most advanced level. In Science, 4th grade Romanian students obtained 526 points, 32 points above the international average (494 points). The average score obtained by Romanian students in science in 2023 is 21 points higher than the score obtained in 2011. Regarding the distribution by performance levels, 93% of Romanian students reach at least the minimum level of proficiency, and 10% of them obtain a score that places them at the most advanced level. \"The skills of eighth-grade students have improved significantly in the last 4 years in mathematics and have regressed in science. 44 countries and 3 reference regions participated in the eighth-grade study, with data collected in Romania from a sample of 128 schools, 129 mathematics teachers, 285 science teachers and 3,722 eighth-grade students,\" the ministry's press release states.\nIn Mathematics, grade 8, Romanian students obtained 496 points, 18 points above the international average (478 points). The average score obtained by Romanian students in Mathematics in 2023 is 18 points higher than the score obtained in 2019. Regarding the distribution by performance levels, 83% of Romanian students reach at least the minimum level of proficiency, and 9% of them obtain a score that places them at the most advanced level. Also, in Science, grade 8, Romanian students obtained 466 points, 12 points below the international average (478 points). The average score obtained by Romanian students in science in 2023 is 4 points lower than the score obtained in 2019. Regarding the distribution by performance levels, 79% of Romanian students reach at least the minimum level of proficiency, and 16% of them obtain a score that places them at the most advanced level.\nThe UB Vice-Rector for Development Projects and Lifelong Learning and Romania's representative in the IEA General Assembly, Lucian Ciolan, stated: \"Developing motivation for learning mathematics and science in children is essential. (...) The performances of 4th and 8th grade students in the latest TIMSS testing highlight general progress, but we will need to clearly identify the vectors that produce this progress and consolidate them in the coming years.\" According to the national coordinator of TIMSS 2023, Daniela Avârvare, mathematics and science skills are extremely necessary in the context of developments in the economy, society, and technology.\nThe TIMSS study takes place every four years and compares the mathematics and science (biology, physics, chemistry) skills of students.",
