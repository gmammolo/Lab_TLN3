  "text": "Troy University announced on Thursday it would lower the cost of dual enrollment classes for high school students by more than $100 per credit hour.\nBeginning in January 2025, the cost of dual enrollment classes for in-state high school students will decrease to $33 per credit hour, down from the current $145 per credit hour. The lower price per credit hour will apply to all qualifying in-state students. Some counties in Florida and Georgia are also considered in-state.\n“Troy University is enhancing access to higher education for high school students by offering affordable college level courses,” Senior Vice Chancellor of Student Services and Administration Sohail Agboatwala said. “This initiative gives students a valuable head start on their academic journey, allowing them to save time and money as they work toward their degrees. By prioritizing accessibility and quality, Troy reaffirms its dedication to empowering learners and building stronger connections with our communities.”\nDual enrollment at Troy is available to students in the 10th to 12th grade as well as home school and private school students from regionally accredited high schools. Students must have a 3.0 or higher GPA and score a 20 or better on the ACT, a 1030 on the SAT or provide a letter of recommendation from a high school administrator to apply for dual enrollment.\nAt Troy University, dual enrollment students are considered in-state students if they live in Alabama or in Bay, Calhoun, Escambia, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Walton or Washington counties in Florida or in Baker, Calhoun, Chattahoochee, Clay, Decatur, Early, Harris, Heard, Macon, Marion, Meriweather, Miller, Muscogee, Quitman, Randolph, Schley, Seminole, Stewart, Talbot, Terrell, Troup, Upson or Webster counties in Georgia.\nTroy University announced the decrease in enrollment at an on-campus luncheon for high School guidance counselors. Troy University Chancellor Jack Hawkins, Jr., spoke with the counselors about the price decrease and what it could mean for students.\n“We have guidance counselors from this region, throughout this entire region and some from out of state [here today],” Hawkins said. “We want them to know about all of the resources available at Troy University. I think one of the more important roles in our high schools today is found in the counselor’s office because it’s there so many critical decisions are made in terms of the future of students.”\nHawkins went on to say that Troy University was one of the first universities in the nation to offer online education more than 30 years ago. He said online education allowed them to reach out to students they could have never reached without a physical campus. He said online education also helped lay the groundwork to reach high school students.\n“What we want to do is make sure high school students know there is a path to the future,” Hawkins said. “That path begins in high school.”\nKeLeigh Pritchett, Troy’s director of Dual Enrollment, said students selected to enroll in Troy’s Early College have a wide range of courses that allow them to receive high school and college credit at the same time. Those courses are designed to transfer to any college or university.\n“When I think of Troy University, I think of generosity,” Pritchett said. “The affordability of our dual enrollment program provides quality educational opportunities to students who might not have the financial ability to take college level courses otherwise. Troy University prioritizes student success and strives to collaborate with outside partners to provide quality and engaging real world learning experiences. Our instructors believe in student centered learning which provides our dual enrollment students with a positive outlook on the collegiate experience.”\nJodie Jefcoat, Pike County Schools Dual Enrollment Coordinator, attended the meeting along with Goshen High School Guidance Counselor Brandi Lusk and Pike County Schools Career Coordinator Gina Maxwell.\nJefcoat said news of the price decrease would benefit the school system. She said about half of the eligible students in Pike County Schools were dual enrolled and the school system paid the dual enrollment tuition.\n“It’s a huge financial savings for students and parents,” Jefcoat said. “It sets the student apart and puts them ahead of the game. Troy University has been awesome helping us with different degree plans. It helps students find their interest and they can earn a degree in a field they are interested in.”\nFor more information on dual enrollment, visit Early College .",
