  "text": "Moline High School students and local police officers stuffed their faces Thursday morning for a good cause.\nEleven teams competed in a donut eating contest — including a team from the Moline Police Department — as part of the school's 75th annual Share Joys holiday fundraiser. This year, students raised nearly $7,000 with the event.\nShare Joys fundraises to provide winter clothes for Moline-Coal Valley students, raising more than $1.5 million since its launch in 1949. The campaign has impacted roughly 375 district students annually in recent years and aims to reach a single-year fundraising high of $75,000 for 2024.\nTo compete in the donut-eating, teams must make a $500 minimum donation to Share Joys and come up with a team name. Many wore costumes or followed a theme, such as the \"Hawaiian Christmas Crew\" — dressed like tropical Christmas elves — and the \"Ninja Turts,\" dressed like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\nPeople are also reading…\nThe \"Donut Express\" raised the most money for this year's contest, earning the title of \"Top Banana.\"\nThe boys basketball team raised the second most money to clinch the \"Top Donut\" title. Senior Braden Freeman was also crowned the \"Donut King\" for being the fastest donut-eater, bringing in another award for the basketball team.\n\"It felt good,\" senior Zachary Hendrickx said of the basketball team's wins. \"It's a fun thing to be a part of, and it's for a really good cause.\"\nFaculty act as referees during the contest to monitor whether donuts are actually being consumed, or if teams are trying to cheat.\nOther than coming into the contest hungry, Hendrickx said his team \"strategized\" by sneakily positioning a trash can behind their spot at the donut-eating table.\nThursday was senior Tori Kaesbauer's first donut eating contest as a participant.\n\"I've been coming (to watch) since freshman year,\" she said. \"One of my friends needed another teammate this time, so I decided to donate $100 and do it.\"\nAdorned in a Colonel Sanders costume — white wig and all — Kaesbauer was on the \"Fast Food Feins\" team. Her team didn't formalize any donut-eating strategies prior to the contest, but she had her own tactics.\n\"I brought a KFC bucket to use,\" Kaesbauer said.\nWhile the Fast Food Feins didn't make the final round of Thursday's contest, she said the experience was worthwhile regardless.\n\"It's just a cool way to raise money,\" Kaesbauer said. \"And, knowing it does go toward an important cause makes it even better.\"\nThe Moline-Coal Valley school board and Moline Police also donated to Thursday's event. Members of the public who wish to contributed can visit [moline.revtrak.net/share-joys/](https://moline.revtrak.net/share-joys/).\nChecks may be made payable to \"Moline High School Share Joys\" and sent to Moline High School, 3600 Avenue of the Cities, Moline, IL 61265.",
