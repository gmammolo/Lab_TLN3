  "text": "UC San Diego Men’s Rowing is joining the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) for the 2024-25 season, along with seven other Division I programs. This affiliation aims to enhance the team's visibility and competitive status in West Coast men's rowing. Head Coach Peter Simeone expressed excitement about the recognition and opportunities this move provides for the program's growth. The Tritons hope to build a stronger brand alongside renowned institutions such as Stanford and Washington. The inaugural MPSF Men's Rowing Championship is set for May 17-18, 2025. By the Numbers- The MPSF will sponsor men's rowing as its 15th sport, expanding its program offerings. - UC San Diego has made eight consecutive IRA Championship appearances and secured three podium finishes at the 2024 Western Sprints Conference Championships. While the MPSF provides a robust platform for competition, challenges remain as UC San Diego transitions from Division II to Division I, necessitating adjustments in team dynamics and performance expectations. State of Play- The Tritons are eager to elevate their status in collegiate rowing through increased competition in the MPSF. - UC San Diego is also a member of the MPSF in men's and women's fencing, signaling a commitment to diverse athletic excellence. As UC San Diego prepares for its first MPSF season, the focus will be on recruitment and training to position itself as a leading program in the new conference. Anticipation builds for the upcoming championships, aiming to leverage this opportunity to enhance national visibility.
