  "text": "ST. GEORGE, Utah (KUTV) — Officials in the Washington County School District said that no child is left hungry, even if they don’t have money to pay for school lunch.\n“It is district policy that if kids get in line, we feed them,” said Stefenee Hymas, the district’s meal benefits secretary. “We are not allowed to discuss an account balance with the kids — we feed them if they get in line.\nThis approach comes as some families in the school district find themselves caught in a financial gray area. Federal guidelines for free and reduced-price lunches are based on strict income thresholds, leaving some families just over the limit but still struggling to make ends meet.\nFor a family of four, annual income must be below about $41,000 to qualify for free lunches and below $58,000 for reduced-price meals. With housing and utility costs continuing to climb in Washington County, many families earning above these limits still face financial strain.\nYuridia Pech, a mother of five whose children attend Washington County schools, said her family missed the cut off for reduced-price meals by just $19.\nShe said the district’s policy regarding feeding every child has been crucial during tough times.\n“It’s a relief knowing my kids can eat no matter what,” she said. “There are days where we are choosing between paying a bill or buying groceries. Knowing that they will get a meal at school is a relief.”\nFor families who do qualify for reduced-price meals, the district has gone beyond federal requirements by waving the remaining costs.\nNormally, families on the reduced-price plan pay $0.40 per lunch and $0.30 per breakfast. But, the district absorbs fees and instead gives this subsection of the population the entirely free meal plan.\nMORE on SCHOOL LUNCH DEBT IN UTAH: Gov. Cox redirects $1.2 million to program reimbursing school lunch debt Utah dad, lawmaker call for permanent solution to rising student lunch debt New push to reduce Utah's multi-million-dollar lunch debt Utah Board of Education to discuss budget priorities, considers school meal program bill Hymas said this cost the district’s child nutrition program roughly $100,000 last year. She said this decision was made to ease the burden on struggling families and reduce administrative costs.\n“We figured we’d make it up elsewhere,” she said. “It helps those who fall into that gap where they qualify for reduced meals but are still having a hard time.”\nDespite these efforts, not all families qualify for assistance, like Pech and her family.\nWhile the school will not turn a child away, they will start to accrue debt for each meal.\n“I have been scared before, wondering if this will be the day that they don’t get a meal,” Pech said. “Luckily, they’ve never been denied. But, the bill just kept racking up.\"\nFor those with unpaid balances, the district makes sure that is only known to the parents. Parents are notified directly about overdue payments, sometimes through repeated phone calls or emails.\n“I would just ask for leniency when it comes to school lunch debt. It’s already stressful and then to get texts, emails, and calls multiple times a week,\" Pech said. \"I’m already trying to pay my past due bills. Now, I’m worried about lunch too.\"\nSchool district officials said they have some programs and community donations to help offset the burden. Pech said she’s also received support from other moms in the community.\nPech would like to see all kids, regardless of income, receive hot meals at school.\n“Inmates get school, housing and free meals — why shouldn’t school children?” Pech asked.\nThe district said that this would likely be cost prohibitive, but they are open to it.\n___",
