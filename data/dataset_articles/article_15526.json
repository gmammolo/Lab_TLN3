  "text": "STEVENSVILLE — Kent Island High School (KIHS) proudly announces William Robbins as the QACPS Visual Arts ‘Teen of the Week’, nominated by Estelle Szczerba, Art teacher at KIHS.\nWill is a talented ninth grade artist who has demonstrated exceptional craftsmanship and creativity in 3D Studio Art 1. Guided by Szczerba, Will brings a unique vision and high standards to each of his projects, pouring meticulous care into planning, material selection, and problem-solving before even beginning his work. Will’s pieces, often inspired by his love of nature, reveal his dedication and thoughtful approach to art.\nSzczerba, notes, “Watching him work is truly exciting—you can tell he’s thought it all out ahead of time and is really enthusiastic about bringing his ideas to life.”\nWill’s creativity is evident in his recent classroom projects. He crafted a paper mache sculpture of his name, incorporating his love of nature with elements inspired by trees and plants. As a playful twist, he engineered the dot in the “i” of his name to float above the letters, showcasing his knack for complex designs. Another impressive work is a vase featuring a realistic octopus wrapped around it, rendered with striking detail.\nIn addition to his classroom projects, Will is a skilled woodturner with a passion for woodworking that he inherited from his father, who taught him about tools and building from a young age. Will recalls watching his father build an intricate play structure—shaped like a dragon with moving parts—an experience that fueled his own drive to create. At the age of twelve, after working on a horse farm to raise funds, Will purchased his own lathe and began turning wood on his own. Now, with three years of experience, he seeks out unique woods from around the world, bringing materials from places like Australia, Hawaii, and even an African seed pod to life in the form of finely crafted vases and even a family charcuterie board.\nKent Island High School is proud to celebrate Will’s achievements and artistry, anticipating even more exciting projects as he continues to hone his skills. His commitment to his craft and his creative spirit make him a young artist to look out for at ArtScene 2025 this spring!\n Featured Local Savings Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save",
