  "text": "All of JKHA and RKYHS packed the Epstein-Stein Auditorium for a Thanks for Giving Assembly the day before Thanksgiving. They took the opportunity as a school community to thank the Livingston Police Department for all that they do for the school community to keep us safe and in appreciation of their partnership. Each division was represented as lower school students read an acrostic poem and delivered the many, many cards they made for the officers; middle school presented a video that they made when a number of the officers came to school this week for students to show their appreciation; and high school screened a student-made video expressing students’ gratitude to the Livingston Police Department along with a card designed and signed by RKYHS. The assembly was an opportunity to reinforce the concept of gratitude and to encourage students to inspire and give to others.\nIn advance of the Thanks for Giving assembly where the whole school had the chance to thank the Livingston Police Department, fourth graders visited the Livingston Police department as another way to show appreciation for all that they do with a delivery of a bagel spread and cards from early childhood.",
