  "text": "Students in the Bi-Cultural Hebrew Academy middle school recently had the opportunity to compete in the Math Olympiad program. This global entity is a math problem solving contest for teams of students in grades four through eight. Each month, from November through March, participants from around the world take a test and then receive immediate feedback on their work.\nThe tests at BCHA are administered by middle school mathematics teacher Darren Bahar. The purpose of the program is to stimulate enthusiasm and a love for mathematics, develop mathematical flexibility in solving problems, and foster mathematical creativity and ingenuity.\nBahar reported on the results for all grades. “Thirty-five students took the test. We had 13 students score a 3/5 on the Math Olympiad! In fourth grade, we had Evan D. score a 4/5 and Gavriel O. score a 4/5. In fifth grade, we had Lila K. score a 5/5. Eitan O. and Ron M-T, both scored a 4/5. In sixth grade, we had Shia M. score a 5/5. Eli L. and Alexander S. both scored a 4/5. That means 21/35 students scored 3/5 or above, which is not only astonishing but our best result in five years!”\nIn the seventh grade: Yuval G. and Yaakov O. both got a 3/5. In eighth grade, Layla B., Hannah H. and Aaron P. all got 3/5. Noam K. got 4/5. Noa M-T. and Miles W. got 5/5.\n“These are truly amazing results,” Bahar remarked. “This version of the test is incredibly challenging.”",
