  "text": "BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - After months of waiting due to construction delays, Mandan High School’s newest piece will be presented to the public on Friday night. “It’s exciting,” Mandan Athletic Director Mark Wiest said. “It’s finally here. We’ve waited patiently.” It’s been a laborious effort from start to finish with a race to beat the buzzer when it comes to the final minor details of the new Mandan High School gym. Things are being finalized Thursday and Friday before the new gym hosts games, but Wiest said they could host games any day if needed. The Braves have been practicing in the new gym since Monday. The hope is that Mandan’s new facility will be a key piece in bringing new events to Mandan’s community. The Braves are already set to host the Optimist Volleyball games next year, as well as the WDA Volleyball tournament. “There’s a lot of different things we would like to be a part of,” Wiest said. “When you have a facility like this that when kids walk in here and other communities walk in here they’re going to really like it and really want to be back and see more different other activities in here.” A lot of the new gym is designed with similarities to the University of Jamestown’s Harold Newman arena, including the barreled roof. “Just so many different features that when people come in here, it’s going to be a wow factor,” Wiest said. The design, featuring seating on all four sides, can host upwards of 2,500 people. There’s a unique multi-colored court, a center-hanging video board, and all-new scoreboards, lighting and sound systems to increase the game day experience. Wiest said he fully expects there to be tweaks after game one, but Friday and Saturday night will set the foundation for the future of sporting events at Mandan High School. “We’ll sit down next week, we’ll review everything, we’ll re-evaluate,” Wiest said. “We might just take the paper, throw it all away and just start over again. Hopefully, we don’t, but that’s what you’ve got to do. We’ve got to start someplace.” The Braves tip off the Class AA basketball season Friday night against Fargo North. Copyright 2024 KFYR.
