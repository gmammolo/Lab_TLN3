  "text": "Marietta College hosts first round of PioBiz Competition\nMARIETTA, Ohio (WTAP) - The first round of Marietta College’s PioBiz competition kicked off Thursday night.\nPioBiz is a three-round business start-up competition for Marietta College students.\nIn the first round, held at Marietta College’s Gathering Place, students identify problems and offer a solution.\nIn later rounds, the participants use those solutions to create a proof of concept and a business plan.\nMarietta College Director of Entrepreneurship Dr. Jacqueline Khorassani said participating in the competition is a good way for the students to get hands-on business experience.\n“We believe in experiential education at Marietta College,” Khorassani said. “So, we can’t lecture stuff and just stop there. The way to learn is to roll up your sleeves and actually try to do something with the ideas that you have.”\nWinners in the final rounds can win up to a $3,000 investment in their business idea.\nSee an error in our reporting?
