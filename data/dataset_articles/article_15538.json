  "text": "This past Thanksgiving morning, Heichal talmidim had the privilege of welcoming their grandfathers for a morning of learning and shiur with their own rebbeim. The morning began with davening, followed by a beautiful and tasty buffet breakfast. During breakfast, Heichal Rosh Yeshiva Rav Aryeh Stechler addressed both the talmidim and their grandfathers, expressing what a privilege it is to partner together in educating their crown jewels—their grandchildren—and passing the mesorah on from one generation to the next. He also emphasized the importance of looking to one’s grandparents as role models of how to live a true Torah lifestyle.\nFollowing breakfast, grandsons and grandfathers learned b’chavrusa in preparation for the morning shiur and then attended lively shiurim together with their grandson’s regular maggid shiur rebbe. It was inspiring to see generations learning and bonding together, with the sounds of Torah permeating the classrooms and bringing smiles to all those in attendance.",
