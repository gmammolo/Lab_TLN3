  "text": "Bruriah High school offers a myriad of elective courses to encourage upperclassmen to pursue and cultivate areas of interest, particularly ones that will influence their future career choices. Bruriah’s Intro to Special Education elective is curated for students that are interested in exploring careers in special education and working with the special needs population. Many students enrolled in the class are already actively involved in volunteering with children with special needs through Camp HASC, Friendship Circle, Ohel and Yachad.\nLast week, the students had the tremendous opportunity to take a trip to Lifetown, a fully inclusive facility featuring opportunities for recreation, education and therapeutic play for people of special abilities. There, Bruriah students were able to run the LifeTown Shoppes, a simulated city where they helped special needs customers navigate their way through stores, movie theaters, and beauty salons, encouraging and interacting with them every step of the way. This activity paired beautifully with the curriculum in their elective class where they have just completed their module on lesson planning for functional curriculums with natural setting lessons.\nSenior Nechama Ringer was blown away by the experience: “It really helped spark further interest in what we are learning. We had the opportunity to make such a beautiful Kiddush Hashem with such special individuals while also gaining real life experience.”\nBruriah students left Lifetown with a renewed sense of purpose and a clearer vision of how they can contribute to the field of special education.",
