The use of coal and firewood, including tandoors in hotels, restaurants, and open eateries, continues to be prohibited.\nNoting that the AQI level in the National Capital Region (NCR) did not cross 300 in the last four days, the top court told the CAQM that stage-3 curbs would be introduced if AQI crossed the 350 mark and stage-4 curbs if AQI crossed 400.\nDelhiites breathed cleaner air for the second consecutive day on Thursday as the AQI was recorded in the \"moderate\" category with a reading of 165.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\n[Open in app](https://www.lokmattimes.com/install_app.htm?utm_source=www.lokmattimes.com&utm_medium=open_in_app&launch_url=https://www.lokmattimes.com/national/schools-in-delhi-to-resume-physical-classes-as-supreme-court-eases-anti-pollution-measures/)",
