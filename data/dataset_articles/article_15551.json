  "text": "'She's Behind You!' at the Pavillion Theatre\nPublished: 5 December 2024\nThis unforgettable performance - first premiered at The Cameron Lecture Series - will return to the Pavilion Theatre on Sunday 19 January 2025.\nShe’s Behind You! captivated audiences and became an instant phenomenon when it premiered in February 2024 as part of The Cameron Lecture Series - a collaboration between the University of Glasgow's College of Arts & Humanities, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and director John Tiffany.\nThis unforgettable performance will return to the Pavilion Theatre on Sunday 19 January 2025.\nPrepare for a wickedly entertaining and deeply moving exploration of the iconic Scottish theatre character, the Dame. This deliciously honest and inventive piece is brought to life by none other than Johnny McKnight, the unstoppable visionary behind post-modern pantomime.\nAlthough we are not hosting this event, we highly recommend securing your tickets soon to experience this remarkable production.\nShe’s Behind You is part of The Cameron Lecture Series which was created by the world-renowned theatre director John Tiffany, former Associate Director of the National Theatre of Scotland.\nJohn’s productions for NTS included Black Watch, Let The Right One In and Peter Pan. His current production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues to wow audiences in London and world-wide.\nJohn has co-created She’s Behind You with Johnny McKnight to celebrate the life-changing University of Glasgow tutor who inspired him to follow a career in the theatre – the late Dr Alasdair Cameron. A renowned, much-admired and influential scholar and teacher in the University of Glasgow’s Department of Theatre Studies, Alasdair Cameron worked tirelessly to highlight the special qualities of Scotland’s dynamic and provocative theatre and performance creators.\nFirst published: 5 December 2024",
