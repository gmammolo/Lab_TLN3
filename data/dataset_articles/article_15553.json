  "text": "U.S. Dept. of Agriculture Acting State Director for Michigan Valarie Handy today announced $1,440,321 in grants to improve distance learning and telemedicine in the Thumb area and central Michigan.\n“These investments illustrate how USDA Rural Development’s programs provide a critical impact on Michigan communities,” Handy said. “The ability to receive medical treatment in your own community, without having to drive dozens of miles over snow-covered rural roads, can make a life-saving difference.”\nThe funds are available through the Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) grant program.\nCaro Community Schools, in Tuscola County, will use a $848,462 grant to equip two hub sites and six end-user sites throughout Clare, Isabella, Tuscola and St. Clair counties with distance learning equipment. Instructors at Caro Community Schools will deliver business industry tours, virtual field trips, dual enrollment and entrepreneurship workshops to five locations benefiting 1,479 students.\nMcKenzie Memorial Hospital, in Sanilac County, will use a $591,859 grant to equip 11 hub sites and 12 end-user sites throughout Sanilac County with telemedicine equipment for patient care and video conferencing equipment for clinician education and training. Medical professionals at the hospital and its affiliated health clinics will deliver services including cardiology, orthopedics, general surgery, gastrointestinal care, pulmonology, behavioral health, wound care, nutrition, critical care and primary medical services across the 12 end-user locations benefiting 2,724 rural residents. The project network includes the main hospital, ten community clinics providing specialized care, and the Sanilac County Jail.\nUSDA touches the lives of all Americans each day in so many positive ways. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA is transforming America’s food system with a greater focus on more resilient local and regional food production, fairer markets for all producers, ensuring access to safe, healthy and nutritious food in all communities, building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices, making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America.
