  "text": "14,700 students take part in traffic awareness quiz across Sirsa\nThe district police, with support from the local administration, organised a block-level quiz competition focussing on traffic rules. Around 14,700 students from 800 schools and colleges across five blocks of the district took part in the event.\nSuperintendent of Police (SP) Vikrant Bhushan highlighted the importance of early education, stating that lessons learned in childhood were remembered for life. “Good education in childhood helps shape responsible citizens. It is the golden period for learning and teaching,” he said.\nBhushan credited the local Education Department for its significant contribution to the success of the quiz. He encouraged students to follow traffic rules willingly, not out of fear of the police. “By adhering to traffic rules, children can play an important role in strengthening the traffic system,” he added.\nHe announced plans for a district-level quiz competition on traffic rules, where top performers would be honoured. Bhushan also urged the students to not only follow traffic rules themselves but also inspire others to do the same, contributing to a safer and more efficient traffic system.\nThe district police are actively conducting seminars and workshops to spread awareness about traffic rules among the general public, which has yielded positive results.",
