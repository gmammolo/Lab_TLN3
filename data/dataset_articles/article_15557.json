Last June, a different company, Grand Peaks, donated a year of rent-free living at a new northwest Denver apartment complex to 10 district teachers. Together, the two efforts get the foundation 10% of the way to its goal.\nFree apartments are certainly a boon to young educators starting off at the bottom of the pay scale in a gentrifying city known for high housing costs. But the giveaways also raise questions about whether free teacher housing is sustainable and how much of a dent it can make in the broader problem.\nAshley Muramoto, a spokesperson for the Denver Public Schools Foundation, said foundation leaders know the free apartments won’t solve Denver’s affordable housing crisis.\n“It’s a step in the right direction to show educators that we support them,” she said. “We’re hoping that it’s also just a starting point for a bigger conversation around affordable housing and what creative philanthropy can do.”\nWe're on a need-to-know basis.

You may also receive occasional messages from sponsors .\nMuramoto said foundation officials have been asked if they’re only looking to partner with developers with new apartments to offer. The answer is no.\n“It doesn’t have to be the shiny, beautiful new space that AvalonBay or Grand Peaks have,” she said. “Other developers that have apartment complexes that have existed for a long time, we’re open to that too.”\nAbout 140 teachers, all with three years of experience or less, applied for one of the five rent-free apartments at Avalon Governors Park, Muramoto said. The winners were randomly selected from that group. There was no requirement to teach at a Denver school near the complex.\nTwo of the teachers will get studio apartments, which normally run about $1,700 a month, and three of the teachers will get one-bedroom apartments, which run about $2,000 a month, Muramoto said.\nGenerally, experts recommend that housing costs, including rent and utilities, shouldn’t exceed 30% of a household’s gross monthly income . For a Denver teacher earning the district’s base salary of $55,257, that means housing costs should be kept to about $1,400 a month or less.\nBut average rents in the city are much higher than that — over $1,900 a month .\nThe Denver district, Colorado’s largest, last year employed about 6,000 teachers. According to data from the Colorado Department of Education, they earned an average of $72,500 annually. Thirty percent of that amount is just over $1,800 a month.\nMuramoto said the foundation would like to see a second round of 15 Denver teachers get free apartments at the two complexes after the first two groups’ rent-free year is up, but it’s unclear if that will happen.\nAnn Schimke is a senior reporter at Chalkbeat, covering early childhood issues and early literacy.
