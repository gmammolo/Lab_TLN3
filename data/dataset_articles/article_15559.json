  "text": "The Terry Law Firm is launching its Safe Driver Scholarship, exclusively available to current seniors at Hamblen County and Greene County High Schools.\nThis scholarship aims to recognize and reward responsible driving habits and continue to promote awareness of safe driving habits among high school students entering college in the upcoming semester.\nEligible applicants can participate by choosing one of three submission options: a written essay with at least 1000 words, create an infographic or similar graphic depiction, or filming a 60-second video, answering the prompt: “How can we educate our community about the dangers of distracted driving”?\nThree winners will be selected from each county, one for each submission category, resulting in six $1,000\nScholarships. Please note that any submissions that pose a danger to anyone will not be considered.\nTo apply, students must fill out the designated form, available at https://www.terry-lawfirm.com/scholarship/ , and submit their materials for judging by April 1, 2025.\nA scholarship selection committee will choose the winners based on their content, originality, and creativity.\nWinners will be announced on May 6, 2025.\n“In our practice, we unfortunately see so many young people injured because of distracted driving,” says Personal Injury Attorney, Brack Terry. “We are hopeful this program will help draw attention to and prevent some of the serious injuries caused by distracted driving. The goal of this program is to both assist our seniors in furthering their education and allow them to be a positive influence on other students and drivers.”\nFor more information and to access the application form, visit https://www.terry-lawfirm.com/scholarship/ .",
