  "text": "Environmental engineering student aims to make an impact on the world\nCaitlin Fanello was inspired by the power and necessity of water in daily life\nCaitlin Fanello, a fifth-year [environmental engineering](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/chemical-environmental-engineering/degrees-programs/environmental-engineering-bachelor-of-science.html) student at the University of Cincinnati, is motivated by the possibility of making a difference in the world. Of the many diverse paths students can take in environmental engineering, Fanello chose to focus her studies on water, including water resources and water treatment.\nEnvironmental engineering is a highly multidisciplinary field, combining principles of civil and chemical engineering with an environmental foundation. Growing up, Fanello was always fascinated by water and its duality of being so destructive, but also extremely necessary for all forms of life. Additionally, she chose this field because it gave her the opportunity to make an impact on the world.\n“I believe there is no longer a borderline between civil engineering, environmental engineering, and even chemical engineering,” said [Soryong (Ryan) Chae](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/chaesg), UC professor of environmental engineering. “Students looking for motivation to make the future more sustainable have a great opportunity with environmental engineering.”\nThrough the [cooperative education (co-op)](https://ceas.uc.edu/real-world-learning/co-op.html) program, she was able to get exposed to different possibilities for her career.\nShe spent her first two co-op rotations at Kiewit, a North American-based construction and engineering organization. During her first rotation, she worked heavily on their greenhouse gas audits, calculating and understanding where their problem sources lie.\nIn her second rotation with Kiewit, the company sent her to a solar farm where they were conducting a project. She served as the contact for environmental compliance. In this role, she conducted stormwater inspections, analyzing where stormwater could erode the ground and where the company could be cited for noncompliance.\nFor her next rotation, she moved to Billings, Mont., to work for a company called DOWL, where she worked specifically in water resources.\n“At DOWL, I learned a lot of new things. They allowed me to go out into the field and work, so I got to experience Montana while I was working, which was really cool,” Fanello said.\nHer final rotations were at Stantec, a company that focuses on sustainable engineering, where she delved deeper into water resources work, solidifying her passion for this sector of the industry.\nOther than water resources, environmental engineers can focus their work on air pollution studies, greenhouse gases, monitoring what is released into the air, as well as wastewater treatment, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliance, hazardous waste materials, and more.\nWhen she graduates from UC in spring of 2025, Fanello plans to continue working in the water resources field and contribute to cleaning up the drinking water for communities and people around major cities.\nFeatured image at top: Caitlin Fanello focuses her studies on water.

Since then, UC has spent the last century fine-tuning and improving the program. The Global Research Labs Program is one of the most recent advancements in co-op opportunities for students.\nUndergraduate research co-ops inspire environmental engineer\nApril 8, 2021\nMegan Naber hopes to put her engineering degree to good use by finding new ways to reduce the environmental problems that arise from the agriculture industry. Naber, an environmental engineering student at the University of Cincinnati, is motivated by her passion for the natural world and her experiences as an undergraduate researcher. Naber is simultaneously working on two degrees as part of the UC College of Engineering and Applied Science ACCEND accelerated degree program.\nEngineering student shifts from the stage to the lab\nMay 14, 2021\nGarek Bushnell came to the University of Cincinnati with a singular goal: to study acting. He graduated in April 2021 with his bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering instead. Bushnell’s path between these two seemingly dissimilar fields is rooted in his mindset that following your passion will drive your determination to succeed – even if that passion comes from an unexpected source.",
