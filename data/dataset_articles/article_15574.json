Login or signup to continue reading\nAll articles from our website & app\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\nAll articles from the other regional websites in your area Continue\nThe numeracy and literacy exams are the only national assessment that all Australian children undertake, with years 3, 5, 7 and 9 involved.\nDuring the tests, students' capabilities in reading, writing, spelling, grammar and numeracy are assessed.\nThe results published in December provided a score for each of the five subjects for all four year groups with the higher the better.\nOf the public primary schools in and around Orange, it was Spring Hill's year 5 group which had the highest cumulative score with 2599, followed closely (2559) by Canobolas Public's year 5 group.\nOverall, it was the year 5 group at Kinross Wolaroi (2637) who topped the region with Orange Christian (2592) finishing third.\nYear 5 students from Bowen Public School outperformed the average across all five NAPLAN subjects when compared to students with similar backgrounds. Picture by Riley Krause In terms of year 3 classes, it was Canobolas Public who stood atop the overall rankings (2476), with public schools such as Spring Hill (2170) and Nashdale (2166) also fairing well.\nBut the overall score isn't the only way to assess results.\nThe MySchool.edu website where results are published also compares year groups with students from similar backgrounds which enables people to see which schools are punching above their weight.\n\"Students have a similar background as determined by parental occupation and education,\" the website read.\n\"The background of students has been shown to have an impact on NAPLAN results.\"\nIn terms comparing students to those with a similar background, Bowen Public saw the most 'above' or 'well above' average scores.\nOf the ten subjects across year 3 and 5, eight fell into these categories with the year 5 group achieving at least an above average score for all NAPLAN exams in 2024.\nYear 3 cohorts at Canobolas Public, Catherine McAuley and Orange East were the only other primary school year groups in town to achieve an above average or better mark in all five subjects when compared to students with a similar background.\nHigh school For high schools, the year 7 and 9 classes at Kinross achieved the best overall scores (2806 and 3014), followed by Orange Christian (2691 and 2952).\nThe same as with primary students, the figures released also compared high school classes to those with similar backgrounds.\nCanobolas High (five), Molong Central (five) and James Sheahan (two) were the only high schools in the region to achieve above or well above average exam scores in this regard.\nThe results also showed which schools were either 'below' or 'well below' average in comparison to those with similar backgrounds.\nNo primary schools fell into this range, but two high schools did.\nThe year 7 class at Kinross was below average in both writing and spelling compared to their peers.\nOrange Anglican Grammar had eight of their 20 (from year 3 to year 9) exam results listed as below average, with their year 5 writing skills listed as well below average in comparison to students of similar backgrounds.\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsapp\nEmail\nCopy\nRiley Krause Senior Journalist\nI am a senior journalist for the Central Western Daily.
