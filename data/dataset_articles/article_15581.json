  "text": "GREEN TOWNSHIP, Ohio (WKRC) - Oak Hills High School hosted a Special Olympics basketball camp, welcoming hundreds of local students of all abilities to participate in a day of dribbling, shooting and teamwork.\n\"We're playing basketball with our friends,\" said Aiden Vernatter.\n\"How does it make you feel,\" asked Local 12.\n\"Happy,\" he said.\nOak Hills Physical Education Teacher Jason Lewis invited students from Oak Hills, Southwest Local Schools, Princeton and Indiana Hill to join the camp.\n\"To watch our students and other students interact together and come together for a common goal is one of the most special things that we do here,\" said Lewis.\nOak Hills High School's girls and boys basketball players served as coaches for the camp.\n\"It makes me feel like I'm doing something better than myself, like making someone else's day better than mine,\" said Nate Riep, an Oak Hills senior basketball player.\nCamp participant Ryan Link was thrilled with the experience.\n\"It's good, it's amazing, I love this,\" said Link.\nThe camp emphasized more than just basketball skills, but also life skills.\n\"My favorite thing is teaching them how to like share and be patient because everybody's like, oh, they want a shot, but everybody's learning they need to share and pass the ball to each other,\" said Rhianna Riep, a junior basketball player.\nThose lessons are important no matter where life takes these students.\n\"I like to play basketball a lot. One day I'm going in a Warriors game,\" said Ryan.\nCamp organizers hoped to expand the event each year. Those interested in participating in 2025 could contact Jason Lewis via email for more information at lewis_j2@ohlsd.org.",
