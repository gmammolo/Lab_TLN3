  "text": "Local Workshop Set to Empower Community with Journalism Skills\nUW-Stout hosting a citizens journalism workshop beginning in January\nIn an era when information is at most people’s fingertips, the role of local journalism has never been more important. Many communities, however, struggle to find timely and accurate news coverage. This struggle can be seen in Menomonie where local news content has been minimal.\nAn upcoming citizen journalism workshop, taught by UW-Stout journalism professor and Emerging Media Director Kate Edenborg, aims to make a change by educating and equipping community members with the tools and skills needed to produce well-researched and accurate content.\n“I've connected with many members of the community who want to do something to help ensure our citizens are well-informed,” Edenborg said. “Providing this class can help them learn how to write local news content which can fill the need we have in Menomonie.”\nNo prior journalism experience is required to participate in the workshop. Throughout six sessions, those interested in sharing news with their community will gain experience in interviewing, editing, writing, and publishing stories.\nBy the end of the course, participants should have acquired the skills to write and produce their own journalistic content which can be used to fill the gap of local news in the community. Whether interested in journalism as a career or as a hobby, this workshop provides the resources necessary to improve the local journalism landscape in Menomonie and surrounding areas.\n“I'm especially hoping that those who take the class tell stories of their neighbors and all the interesting things that happen all the time in our town,” Edenborg said.\nThe course will be held in person on UW-Stout’s campus Jan. 28 and March 4 from 5-7pm and virtually on Feb. 4, 11, 18, and 25 from 5-7pm.\nThe cost for the workshop is $149. There is also an option to apply for a [scholarship](https://uwstout.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3gCx8GoCBooMjga) for the workshop, funded by the Wisconsin Newspaper Association Foundation, Eye on Dunn County, and Local News Group. Applicants will be asked to complete a short survey and submit a few paragraphs about their interest in the program.\nNo prior journalism experience is required to participate in the workshop. Throughout six sessions, those interested in sharing news with their community will gain experience in interviewing, editing, writing, and publishing stories.\nFor more information on the workshop and to register, visit [www.uwstout.edu.](https://www.uwstout.edu/outreach-engagement/continuing-education-conferences/mini-courses/citizen-journalism)",
