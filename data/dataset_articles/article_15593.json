  "text": "Dr. Donovan Stanberry, Campus Registrar at UWI Mona\nBy Nakinskie Robinson\nNormal operations have been restored at the University of the West Indies, Mona on Thursday after the institution's primary and independent water supply system developed challenges on Tuesday, resulting in the suspension of some services.\nCampus Registrar Dr. Donovan Stanberry told Radio Jamaica News the National Water Commission has mobilised its standby water supply service to ensure the institution's operations continue without major disruption.\n\"That happened late sometime last evening. The connection has been made. However, the pressure is not sufficient to give us the kind of supply we would have had when our own pumps are working. Added to what NWC has given us, we have been able to continue with our trucking in our priority areas. And that was sufficient for us to have normal operation restored today. Our priority continues to be examinations, which are now in progress. And until we are fully back on our system, examination will remain a priority,\" he outlined.\nHe said the impact of the supply disruption has been cushioned since teaching has ended for the semester so there is less traffic on campus.\n\"The other good thing is that we are going into the weekend when water supply demand is drastically reduced on the campus. We are hoping that by the next week our own supply will be back to normal and we accord priority to our more sensitive areas like the halls of residence and of course the examination venues,\" said the registrar.\nOnly emergency services and the administering of exams were allowed on the campus on Wednesday.\nThe University Hospital of the West Indies, which operates on a separate system, is not affected by the supply disruption.",
