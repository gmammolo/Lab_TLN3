  "text": "Two remarkable George Brown College (GBC) alumni have demonstrated that education extends far beyond the classroom. Chris Campbell, an alumnus of the Carpentry General Apprenticeship program, serves as the President of the Carpenters' Union Local 27 and is a member of the [GBC Foundation Board of Directors](/about/foundation/about-the-george-brown-college-foundation/board-of-directors). Alongside him is Rokhaya 'Rok' Gueye, a [Construction Engineering Technician](/programs/construction-engineering-technician-program-t161) alumna who is now the Community Partnership Coordinator at the Carpenters’ Regional Council. Together with a group of volunteers, they recently embarked on a life-changing humanitarian mission in St. James, Jamaica. When they set foot on Jamaican soil, they carried more than just construction skills—they brought hope, compassion, and the power to change lives.\nMore than just construction\nGraduates of GBC's [Centre for Construction & Engineering Technologies](/construction-engineering-technologies), Campbell and Gueye, exemplify the college's commitment to creating professionals who make a real difference. From framing walls to installing roofing, the team from Toronto created more than just a structure—they built hope for a family in need.\n\"It was a deeply fulfilling experience to participate in a humanitarian project in Jamaica,\" Gueye shared. \"As a woman, providing a safe home to a less fortunate family means offering them a place to live that is secure, stable, and conducive to their well-being. Together, we transformed Beulah’s life and laid the foundation for a lasting legacy for her family and future generations.”\nA collective effort of compassion\nThe project was a testament to community spirit. Volunteers personally covered their expenses, and additional fundraising efforts raised $20,000 to complete the home. Working alongside the Carpenters' Local 27 union and the charitable organization Food for the Poor, the team constructed a house that promises a brighter future for Beulah and her family, the recipients.\nChris Campbell reflected on the experience, saying, \"We came back feeling inspired with a renewed appreciation of the difference we can all make for those who are less fortunate.\"\nImpact beyond borders\nTheir work does more than provide shelter—it breaks the cycle of generational poverty and demonstrates the power of skilled professionals giving back to communities in need. This humanitarian initiative represents the true essence of professional development—using skills to make a meaningful impact that extends far beyond professional boundaries.\nStay connected with Alumni Relations for future events, initiatives, and career development opportunities.
