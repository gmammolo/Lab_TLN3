  "text": "Free access to breaking news is sponsored by Dorsett Automotive Close\nLilly Endowment gives Ivy Tech Foundaton $21.9 million Goal is to strengthen Indiana’s early childhood workforce Tribune-Star staff report Dec 5, 2024 Dec 5, 2024\nLilly Endowment Inc. has awarded Ivy Tech Foundation a $21.9 million, three-year grant to support the efforts of Ivy Tech Community College to help strengthen Indiana’s early childhood education workforce.\nThis funding will support programs and partnerships that will expand options for and improve access to high-quality post-secondary education and training for current and future early childhood education professionals, Ivy Tech said in a news release Thursday.\nIndiana’s current supply of well-qualified early childhood education professionals is inadequate and hampers the state’s capacity to provide high-quality child care options. Demand for these professionals is expected to keep growing.\nThis grant will support Ivy Tech, the state’s largest provider of post-secondary education and training to early childhood professionals, in its efforts to expand current programs and create new opportunities.\n“As Indiana’s workforce engine, Ivy Tech has a responsibility to fuel the state’s pipeline of skilled early childhood education talent,” said Sue Ellspermann, president, Ivy Tech Community College. “We are grateful for the generous support from Lilly Endowment that is enabling us to remove barriers to education and training for early childhood educators.”\nWith support from the grant, Ivy Tech aims to increase enrollment in its early childhood education programs by more than 100 percent by 2027, ultimately graduating 1,950 individuals annually. Ivy Tech will:\nDevelop competency assessments that will recognize and reward adult professionals for skills and competencies. Create early childhood education micro-credentials, short, focused and competency-based trainings that align with state workforce needs and traditional degree pathways. Partner with various state agencies, Indiana organizations focused on advancing early childhood education programming, and post-secondary institutions committed to innovative models to launch Federally Registered Adult-Based Early Childhood Apprenticeships. Explore implementation of Kids on Campus, a program of the National Head Start Association and the Association of Community College Trustees, to address the early childhood education needs of student parents while providing early childhood education students with experience. Develop new transfer pathways that enable students to apply their early childhood education associate degree toward earning a bachelor’s degree in elementary education.. Promote new education and training opportunities and elevate early childhood education as a fulfilling career path through a statewide marketing campaign.",
