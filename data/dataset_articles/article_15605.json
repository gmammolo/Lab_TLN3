  "text": "UA Little Rock Graduate Achieves Long-Awaited Master’s Degree and Professional Growth\nAfter a more than a 20-year gap since earning her undergraduate degree, Bobbie Handcock found herself inspired by the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic to return to school and pursue a long-held dream: earning her master’s degree.\nNow a first-generation student from Ohio, Handcock will soon graduate from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock with a [Master of Arts in professional and technical writing](https://ualr.edu/rhetoric/graduate/).\nLike many Americans during the pandemic, Handcock reevaluated her career path in 2021 and decided it was time for a change. Landing a job as a web content specialist at UA Little Rock presented the perfect opportunity to align her professional and academic goals. “Some might say it was kairos — or the opportune time,” Handcock said.\nFrom there, she began to research whether graduate school was the right fit for her. Once she was accepted to the graduate school, Handcock began taking courses online. She also took advantage of student support services at UA Little Rock, including getting a mentor to help her navigate this new phase of learning.\nThrough the professional and technical writing program, Handcock has been able to gain experience on real-world projects and sharpen her skills.\n“One aspect that I love about attending UA Little Rock is the real-world projects I’ve been able to do and the real-world experiences I’ve had,” Handcock said.\nDuring her time in graduate school, she created a style guide for a Pine Bluff business and completed an independent study, where she worked on a grant writing team at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Her courses also helped her become the volunteer marketing coordinator of the HighEdWeb (now Digital Collegium) Leadership Academy, an online program designed to develop leadership skills for digital professionals working in higher education.\n“Pursuing my master’s in professional and technical writing sharpened my skills, making me a more versatile writer, skilled editor, and effective communicator. I’ve had some wonderful professors who helped me expand my expertise in research, editing, document design, grant writing, and writing for social media,” Handcock said.\nThe Lonoke, Arkansas, resident said the most influential person in her graduate school journey has been her husband, Julius.\n“He has supported and encouraged me since day one,” she said. “I could not have done it without him. When I got tired or frustrated, he helped me through it. When I reached a milestone, he celebrated with me.”\nTo other students who want to pursue a graduate degree, Handcock said, “You’ve got this. If you need help, UA Little Rock has so many resources available. I had a graduate student mentor, and I attended the Student Success Fest at the beginning of each semester.”\nThe university has a welcoming environment and is open to students from all walks of life, she said.\n“Whether you’re a nontraditional student like me or just coming out of high school, I truly believe there is a place for you here,” Handcock said.\nThis story was written by Sydney Ambrus.",
