  "text": "In Notre Dame football recruiting, coach Marcus Freeman says, 'I love multisport guys'\nSOUTH BEND— Backgrounds in sports other than football clearly impress the [Notre Dame ](https://www.ndinsider.com/story/sports/college/football/2024/12/04/early-signing-day-updates-for-notre-dame-football-recruiting-marcus-freeman-will-black-jadon-blair/76758627007/)recruiting apparatus.\nIn addition to established two-sport college athletes Drayk Bowen (linebacker/baseball), Jordan Faison (wide receiver/lacrosse), Tyler Buchner (wide receiver/lacrosse) and Matt Jeffery (wide receiver/lacrosse), Notre Dame’s 2025 [signing class ](https://www.ndinsider.com/story/sports/college/football/2024/12/01/when-do-final-cfp-rankings-come-out-heres-what-notre-dame-football-fans-must-know-marcus-freeman/76689743007/)includes a slew of newcomers that can shine in other sports.\nBrandon Logan, the safety/outfielder from Fort Wayne’s Snider High School, was a Vanderbilt baseball commit until Notre Dame came calling.\nJames Flanigan, the tight end from Green Bay, Wisc., won state titles in hockey and track and field.\nOffensive tackle Will Black, the highest-rated recruit in Notre Dame’s 12th-ranked signing class, grew up in London, Ontario playing hockey, basketball and lacrosse before he outgrew those pursuits. Black now stands 6-foot-7 and 292 pounds.\nAnd cornerbacks Cree Thomas (decathlon) and Mark Zackery IV (basketball) have distinguished themselves in non-football ways.\n“We have some multisport athletes here at Notre Dame,” Irish coach Marcus Freeman said. “We love that. I encourage that. I think it’s something that we put tremendous value in.”\nLast December’s hiring of director of football performance Loren Landow, who has worked with Olympic-class athletes from a variety of sports, has only increased the potential benefits of football-plus athletic backgrounds.\nThose benefits cover everything from the physiological to the psychological, from avoiding injury to playing through various thresholds of pain. Freeman, whose eldest son, Vinny, wrestles and plays football at Penn High School; knows that better than most big-time football coaches.\nFirst-hand knowledge of multisport value\nAt 10, Freeman won an age-group national championship in taekwondo before turning his attention to wrestling and football. At Wayne High School in Huber Heights, Ohio, Freeman competed in track and field in the spring.\n“I think there are movements that playing in different sports can really help you with in football,” Freeman said. “Yes, there’s the basic athleticism, movement traits that different sports give you. But the thing I keep coming back to is that competitive spirit.\n“It’s hard to compete sometimes just going to a (football) trainer, and somebody might say, ‘You’re wrong because we compete in our training session.’ But I want to see you go head-to-head in track. I want to see you go head-to-head in baseball. Brandon Logan, I want to see you play baseball, and maybe not just look to specialize in one sport.”\nNewly signed offensive tackles Matty Augustine (hockey) and Owen Strebig (baseball) competed in other spots as did defensive lineman Dominik Hulak (hockey). Receivers Elijah Burress and Antavious “Scrap” Richardson honed their running form as track sprinters; Richardson, in fact, won Georgia state titles in the 100 and 200 meters.\n“I can go down the list about multisport athletes,” Freeman said. “I love multisport guys. It keeps you busy, keeps you in shape.”\nAnd Zackery, like 2024 signee and fellow defensive back Tae Johnson (Fort Wayne North Side) before him, might be as skilled on the basketball court as he is on the football field.\n“(Zackery) is one of the few football players who can truly play basketball,” Freeman said of the Ben Davis High School star from Indianapolis. “Most of our guys that play basketball are football players (who are) just on the basketball court. He’s a basketball player when he’s on the basketball court. He is a unique talent.”\nOn Freeman’s watch, Notre Dame football seems to be collecting those.\nMike Berardino covers Notre Dame football for the South Bend Tribune and NDInsider.com.
