  "text": "Davenport University recently held a Biological Laboratory Science (BLS) Career Forum on its W.A. Lettinga Grand Rapids Campus to connect students with leading professionals in the field.\nThe BLS Career Forum exemplified Davenport’s commitment to connecting the BLS, nursing, medical assisting and healthcare administration students with industry leaders and preparing them for successful transitions from the classroom to the workforce.\nThe event featured six accomplished professionals who shared industry highlights, personal career journeys, current roles, and advice for students and prospective employees. Two of the speakers are Davenport alumni, and one is a current instructor for Davenport.\nAshlyn Skidmore, associate scientist for Cayman Chemical and Davenport BLS alumna, spoke about her work in physical science and research. She shared tips and wisdom as a former Davenport student and highlighted her career journey, including working as a research technician at Van Andel Institute, before moving to her current role.\nZoie Amatore, Davenport BLS graduate and associate surgical sales consultant for Dilon Technologies, introduced students to the medical device and pharmaceutical sales field and highlighted the need for sales professionals with a strong science background. She also shared her experiences as a student at Davenport and how they shaped her career path to where she is now.\nDavenport forensic science adjunct instructor Bill Ruhf shared insights into forensic science, covering opportunities in law enforcement, government and military settings across Michigan and the world. Bill also talked about the technical skills required to enter the forensic science field and how Davenport’s BLS program prepares students for professional positions. He also shared stories of working as a forensic scientist.\nSpeaker Kevin Eggebeen, quality control manager with Perrigo, talked about the job opportunities available within the biotech and pharmaceutical fields, such as research and development, quality control, quality assurance, and manufacturing.\nJon Baker, director of labs at U of M Sparrow Health told students that the need for medical laboratory science professionals is high and advised them on what employers are looking for in prospective employees.\nFinally, Monique Carpenter, director of biologics technology at Zoetis, informed students of internship and job opportunities in animal health and research. She also stressed the importance of developing soft skills.\nThe Q&A portion of the forum gave students a chance to ask about career preparation, skill-building and what employers look for in new hires. Panelists emphasized the importance of soft skills (communication, adaptability and teamwork), hard skills (technical proficiency and problem-solving abilities), and character traits (hunger for knowledge, work ethic and the ability to prioritize tasks).\nThe forum concluded with one-on-one networking, where students engaged directly with panelists to explore career-specific advice, internship openings, and potential collaborations.\n“There were several big takeaways for students,” said Daniel Palmatier, chair of Davenport’s Science Department. “First, they learned about internship opportunities, and second, they learned about employer expectations, including the importance of a proactive mindset, critical thinking skills, and the ability to work independently and collaboratively.”\nFurthermore, the event reinforced the Science Department’s motto: “Creating Tomorrow’s Scientists Today.” Palmatier said the Science Department looks forward to building on this success by strengthening partnerships with participating employers and continuing to open doors for its students’ bright futures.\nPalmatier said the employers who attended the forum expressed strong interest in continuing collaborations with Davenport University, signaling potential partnerships to support student internships, job placements, and professional development.",
