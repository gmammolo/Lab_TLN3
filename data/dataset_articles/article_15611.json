  "text": "By Brian Hauch ,\n2 hours ago The newest Auburn Tigers quarterback, five-star incoming freshman Deuce Knight, is already starting to earn some accolades.\nOn3 Sports recently released its ‘2025 Quarterback Superlatives’ list which outlines some of the best high school prospects in the country. Knight was given the ‘Most Athletic’ tag by columnist Charles Power , an accolade that makes sense given the Mississippi native’s rare combination of 6-foot-4 size and 4.53 second 40-yard speed.\nAthleticism was never a knock for on the consensus top 6 quarterback in the 2025 class. A tri-sport athlete who also played basketball and won multiple state championships in the long jump in high school, Knight has not been shy when it comes to the comparisons between himself and former Auburn great Cam Newton during the recruitment process. The 18-year-old went as far as to say he models his game off of Newton’s, who was also his favorite player growing up, during his interview with the media on National Signing Day.\nNow done with high school football and focused on winning the quarterback competition on the Plains next season, Knight will hope to channel his elite physical tools into becoming one of the best all-around quarterbacks in college football. While he is the likely favorite to start games for Hugh Freeze next season with the current roster, the Tigers seem certain to bring in a veteran transfer portal player to compete for the starting job alongside Knight and 2025 sophomore Walker White.\nContact/Follow us @ TheAuburnWire on X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Auburn news, notes, and opinion.
