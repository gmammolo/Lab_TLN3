  "text": "MURFREESBORO, Tenn. - As Murfreesboro continues to expand in population, so does the need for classroom space. WGNS spoke to Lisa Trail, Director of Communications for the City Schools, and asked if any new schools are on the drawing board…1 Adding onto existing schools allows the city operated system to grow more efficiently.\nSeven years ago, the city added 7 new classrooms to Blackfox Elementary School, which is a school that has seen high enrollment numbers this year…\nCurrently, enrollment increases are not high enough to build a new standalone school within the City Schools system. However, officials are closely monitoring population trends and the development of new neighborhoods. As new homes are constructed, families tend to move in quickly, potentially impacting school enrollment and capacity…\nIn 2019, the city opened Salem Elementary School near the intersection of Veterans Parkway and St. Andrews Drive. The new school became the 13th facility operated by the Murfreesboro City Schools District. Currently, the district serves over 9,340 students and employs approximately 800 certified staff members. Like the Rutherford County School System, the City Schools accommodate a diverse group of children each year, with over 30 languages spoken in classrooms across Murfreesboro.\nAPPLY: On a side note, now is the time for parents to submit applications for their child to attend the Discovery School, an academic magnet school for high-achieving and gifted students. With only 60 spots available, the deadline to submit applications is open now through January 31, 2025. The applications are for the 2025-2026 school year. For more details, visit the Discovery School HERE.\nLISTEN: Hear our latest interview with the Murfreesboro City Schools HERE.",
