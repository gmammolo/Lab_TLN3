(Photo courtesy of Quinton Yates) When Anissa Christian crosses the stage to accept her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree on Monday, she will be crossing the threshold to a new career built on a desire to serve and confidence in the power of education.\nChristian, 55, worked as an elementary school teacher for 27 years, first in South Carolina and then in Memphis after she moved here with her family in 1994. She holds a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in education. After leaving the classroom, Christian said she knew she wanted to continue to serve others. “I have learned to appreciate nursing as another way of helping those in need,” she said. “It has geared my passion toward serving at another level.”\nChristian is one of 60 students from the College of Nursing who will receive their degrees at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center’s commencement ceremony on Monday, December 9, at 10 a.m. at the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts. A total of 116 students are graduating, including 28 from the College of Medicine, 17 from the College of Graduate Health Sciences, and 11 from the College of Health Professions.\nAt commencement, Christian will be recognized as the BSN Class Award winner. The award is presented to a member of the graduating class chosen by classmates as an outstanding role model with qualities including empathy, respect for others, motivation, and enthusiasm.\nCollege of Nursing Dean Wendy Likes, PhD, DNSc, APRN-BC, FAAN, FAANP, presented Christian with the BSN Class Award at the college’s pre-commencement awards program. As a lifetime educator, Christian appreciates the importance of good teaching and praised the instruction she received at UT Health Science Center. “The knowledgeable instructors who are passionate about their work have been the driving force to my success throughout the program,” she said.\nShe plans to continue her nursing education at UT Health Science Center in the Doctor of Nursing Practice program while working as a bedside nurse in a local intensive care unit. Her long-term goal is to open and operate personal care homes for the elderly.\n“I’m preparing to begin the application process the day after graduation for entry into the Psychiatric Mental Health DNP for fall of 2025,” Christian said.\nChancellor Peter Buckley, MD, will confer the degrees at commencement. The ceremony’s alumni speaker will be Mike Griffin, president of the University of Tennessee Alumni Association Board of Governors. The ceremony will also include remarks from UT System President Randy Boyd and a keynote speech from Alisa Haushalter, DNP, associate professor in the College of Nursing.\nThe commencement ceremony will be streamed live on the UT Health Science Center Graduation website .",
