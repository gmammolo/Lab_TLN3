  "text": "Nearly 5,000 people work to provide and support a quality education to more than 30,000 students in Des Moines. From school administrators and educators to bus drivers and technology professionals to food and nutrition providers to financial experts, these dedicated DMPS employees are committed to providing the best possible experience for students and families. Each month the Become Here Spotlight will shine on an administrator, an educator and a staff member to share a little more about the many people working to teach and support the children and students of our community, and in the words of those who nominated them for the recognition.\nMary Jo Cook\nSubstitute\nHillis Elementary School\nMary Jo is such a valuable part of the Hillis Elementary School team in the ways she provides classroom substitute support when certified staff are absent and in the many ways, she steps in to help when we are shorthanded. Mary Jo is well known by students, and she has established excellent relationships with the Hillis students as well as the Hillis staff. Mary Jo does not only help in our times when we are shorthanded, she also volunteers to serve on our Hillis A-Team which provides planned social activities for the purpose of building community, socialization and recognition of staff. There is literally nothing Mary Jo will not do for our Hillis team.\nMary Jo has taken on lunch duties, recess duties, assisted with setting up classrooms, assisted in preparing curriculum materials, cleaned out shelving areas and organized lost and found. Mary Jo had PERFECT attendance last year and did not miss one day of school. Mary Jo is a true champion for students, and we are so grateful she is serving at Hillis Elementary School!\nTerry Allfree\nSenior Officer\nDMPS Public Safety\nTerry Allfree has been with Des Moines Public Schools for 4 1/2 years and is the senior officer during the afternoon shift for DMPS Public Safety. The afternoon shift is tasked with ensuring safety and security of all after school activities including athletic events. Officer Allfree brings a wealth of emergency response experience to the department as he currently serves as a police officer for Prairie City and the Iowa State Fair on a part-time basis.\nIn his spare time, he likes to spend time with his grandkids and volunteers as a firefighter with the Colfax Fire Department.\nPraveen Bannikatti\nPrincipal\nVirtual Campus\nPraveen Bannikatti is making big moves at Virtual Campus in his first year as Principal. He and the team have drastically improved student attendance and Grade Level instruction while also retaining students at record levels. Additionally, Praveen has aligned schedules with brick-and-mortar high schools to increase student opportunities and create seamless enrollment options for students within DMPS and those seeking a high-quality virtual learning option from outside of our city. The future of Virtual Campus, post-pandemic, is bright thanks to his leadership.",
