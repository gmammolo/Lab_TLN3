  "text": "MACON, Ga. — Bibb County School District ’s Innovation and Technology Academy is open. It is an extension of the district's W.S. Hutchings College and Career Academy for career, technical and agricultural education (CTAE) . The academy will be home to several career pathway programs, and the robotics program is the first to move in. \"It's nice that we actually have a facility that we're able to do all of this work in because it's a lot of work,” Leo Hillman said. “And when you feel comfortable in an environment where you can do that work, I believe we'll be able to output a much better product.\" Howard High School seniors Henry Blankenship and Leo Hillman said they enjoy representing Bibb County at their regional and state robotics competitions through the [RoboBibb](/article/news/local/i-think-were-a-good-team-bibb-county-schools-robobibb-robotics-team-heading-to-houston-texas/93-49e0573c-568f-4b5f-90d8-78074b87c6b0) team, showing off what their coding can do. Blankenship said they can use their robotics skills after graduation. “I want to do electrical engineering,” he said. “Every year I've been on the team, I do all the wiring for the robot. All of the connections for all the different motors and the computer and everything, I'm the one who does all that.” Howard High School senior Donald Williams said programming a robot the right way is rewarding. \"You feel like a sense of pride that you have a chance to make a change in the world,” he said. “It's like step by step that you're making the world a better place.\" That's the kind of inspiration Macon-Bibb and the school district hope all students will feel. Mayor Lester Miller said these buildings and program investments are important to develop the local workforce. \"We have a college and career academy. How important that is and how vital that is and how vital it is to make sure that our kids are able to get those jobs,” he said. “Get those jobs to support their families so they can continue to work and live and enjoy life like the rest of us want to do.\" The Innovation and Technology Academy is on Eisenhower Parkway in Macon. The robotics program will move to the new building in January. More pathways and courses will start there next fall.
