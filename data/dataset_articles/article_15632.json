  "text": "Boone Children's Gallery: Pop Up Art Workshop\n- Sat, Jan 18, 2025\n- 11 am - 5 pm PT\n- LACMA\n-\nFree\nMake art with us! These exhibition-based workshops encourage creative inspiration for different activities, so make sure to check out the corresponding galleries. No prior art-making experience is necessary; our friendly staff will happily work with you on your creation. All ages are welcome!\nThese workshops take place on Saturdays, January 4, 11, 18, 25.\nThroughout history, humanity has looked to the skies for answers and inspiration. To comprehend our existence, cultures across the globe have relied on symbolism, beliefs, and interpretations centered on the cosmos. In this quest, we have made remarkable scientific advancements, tracking planets, measuring time, and even traveling to the moon, bringing us closer to the heavens than ever.\nThis January, we invite you to explore the exhibition Mapping the Infinite: Cosmologies Across Cultures. Together, we will examine how different cultures have viewed the constellations and consider how they have shaped humanity. We will also explore how animals, mathematics, textiles, and other elements have deepened our understanding of the universe. Join us as we investigate and create an amazing piece of artwork! Taught by teaching artist Bianca Argueta.\nPhoto © Museum Associates/LACMA\nPhoto © Museum Associates/LACMA",
