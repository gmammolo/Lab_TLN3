  "text": "(ST. JOSEPH, Mo.) A librarian at Spring Garden Middle School has recently been named the Northwest Region Missouri Association of School Librarians Librarian of the Year.\nLindsay Holland loves reading, books, and helping kids learn, so becoming a librarian for her was an easy choice.\nSince joining Spring Garden Middle School 6 years ago, Holland has worked hard to make her library a safe place for all of her students, while giving them incentives to learn.\n\"Our library is just a gathering place. It's a place for students to come and feel like they belong. We do a lot of clubs in the mornings. We have Chess Club, we have Rubix Club, we have the Sports Card Trading Club. So I think it's kind of a community space where everyone can kind of walk in as equals.\" Said Holland.\nHolland's impact on her students' lives is felt even after they leave middle school, with her stating that she has former students recognize her and share how their lives are going even after graduating.\n\"It's so sweet to watch them grow up. And they'll be like, 'oh, I loved you so much.' I'm like, 'oh, you were so ornery. But yes, I loved you too, and I'm glad you're doing well.'\"\nHer efforts came into fruition this year when she was named the Northwest Regional Librarian of the Year, a nationwide competition that recognizes great teachers and their efforts to make learning fun and efficient.\n\"The president of our region nominated me for the Regional Librarian of the year. And then that goes on. There's 11 regions, so it'll go on to semi finalists sometime in the winter, whenever their winter meeting is, and then at our big state convention, they'll have three that they choose from.\"\nAnd she says that she is truly humbled by the nomination.\n\"I have the best job ever. So it's just another awesome thing to have happen. It's an honor. It was a big surprise. They really got me. I still can't believe I got it, but I'm very honored.\"\nHolland's next steps are to complete her paper on School Librarian of the Year at the state level, and if she advances to the nationwide level, then she will then show off her skills among the best of the best.",
