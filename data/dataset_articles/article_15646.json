  "text": "The Reason Bedside Baby Bed Is Everyone's Obsession In 2024\nBedside Baby Beds\nBaby bedside cribs let parents keep their newborn close during the night without compromising on safety. They are designed specifically for newborns and can be used up to 4 to 6 months.\nThe Halo Bassinest is a swivel-over-the-parent's-bed that has the ability to be pushed down to let parents pick up their infant during feeding times at night. However, the base won't be able to fit under beds less than 4.5 inches high.\nSafety features\nA crib that is placed at the bedside allows parents to monitor, comfort and feed their children at night without having leave their bed. This arrangement of sleeping is ideal for new mothers recovering from childbirth or with mobility issues. It may also help parents sleep better at night. It is essential to think about safety features when purchasing a bedside crib.\nThe primary safety concern for this type of sleep surface is that it's not a complete barrier between the bed of the parent and the baby's sleeping space, resulting in gaps that could pose the risk of suffocation for infants. Sharing a bed increases the body heat of the parent and can increase the risk of overheating. This could result in SIDS.\nAlthough some manufacturers claim that bedside co-sleepers are more secure than traditional cribs, these products aren't subject to the the safety standards of the CPSC. They could have the slats which allow babies' legs or heads to become trapped and their attachment mechanisms can be unstable and lead to separation.\nMany of these surfaces also contain loose bedding, which can lead to suffocation. Babies don't have the muscle or coordination to free themselves from entanglement in soft bedding, and gaps between the frame and the mattress can cause a suffocation risk. Some of these products also have a hard bottom that can hurt a child when they fall on it. One commenter suggested the CPSC include pictograms in warnings to these products. This could decrease the likelihood that caregivers miss key elements. In addition, bedside cribs should come with a smooth transition mechanism to keep the baby from falling off the bed of their parents.\nBedding\nA bedside crib (also called a co-sleeper or bassinet) lets babies sleep next to their parents' beds, while maintaining a separate space. This type of safe co-sleeping helps reduce the risk of suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome by keeping babies close to their parents.\nBaby bedding for a bedside sleeper could include crib sheets blankets, bumpers, and toys. Make sure that the bedding you select is appropriate for the bedside sleeper to avoid pockets or bulges that could obstruct the baby's breathing. Also, ensure that the mattress you buy for your bedside sleeper is firm and fits comfortably without gaps around the edges.\nIf you're looking for a bedding set that will keep your baby clean in case they fall or spill up in the night, choose something that is easy to wash and dry. You may also want to think about a travel bag for your bedside sleeper, to make it easy to carry it around when you travel with your family or visit grandparents home.\nIf your baby has outgrown the bedside sleeper, you can move your child to a crib or toddler that is all on its own. When you transition to a crib, move it away from the parents' bed over a period of time, either weeks or months, to let your child learn to sleep in his own space but still feel connected to them. Be sure to choose a crib that is able to fold easily for storage and transportation. Some cribs can be converted to a play yard or deeper bassinet. This makes them an excellent choice for parents who frequently travel.\nTilt function\nA bedside sleeper, also referred to as bassinet is a bassinet that is attached to the bed's side for adults. One side is lower than the other to allow parents to reach their child at night. It could have tilt features that help ease reflux in infants. Some parents have found that this feature can help their child sleep better. It is important to keep in mind that a slanted, or elevated, sleeping surface could encourage your baby's chin to the chest position. This can cause suffocation, and should be avoided.\nA good mattress is crucial in deciding on the right crib for your child's bed. It must be flat and firm as well as ventilated. The mattress should be similar to the size of the crib and fit comfortably into the frame. It is recommended to buy a new mattress for your crib as a second-hand one could increase the chance of SIDS. Some retailers offer mattresses designed for specific bed frames, therefore it is recommended to stick with those if you can.\nSome cribs designed for bedside are made to tuck under your bed to save space and bring your child close, such as the Halo BassiNest. However certain beds are too low for this kind of crib. The feet that are splayed out of the BassiNest make it difficult to slide under some beds. It's also difficult to slide it under a divan bed, which can cause it to slide or sway out of alignment with the mattress.\nOther types of bedside bassinets such as the Ingenuity Sleep and Grow Bedside Crib can be set close to your mattress however, they aren't able to tilt. CHOICE recommends that parents use these beds if they have a solid air-conditioned bed. The tilt of a bassinet or bedside crib can encourage your baby to fall into a dangerous position and increase the risk of suffocation.\nPosition of foot-to-foot\nA bedside crib, also known as a co-sleeper or a bassinet, is a small crib that is attached to the side of a bed for adults. This allows parents to access their child easily at night. They are generally larger than the standard cots and bassinets.\nSome cribs for bed have a tilt feature that can aid babies suffering from digestive issues such as reflux or colic. It's important to use the tilt function with care and at a very small angle to avoid from suffocation. Consult your physician or health professional if you are unsure whether to use the feature.\nThe mattress is another important safety factor to consider when selecting a crib for your child's bedside. To minimize the risk of SIDS, the mattress should be flat, firm and airy. A mattress that is too firm can result in obstruction of the airway in infants, which can lead to danger. A breathable mattress can also help your child remain cool during the night, which reduces the risk of overheating.\nIt's recommended that you put your baby to sleep in their own safe sleeping area - either a crib, cot, or Moses basket. It could be tempting to sleep in the same bed with your baby, but this can result in SIDS. It's best to wait until your baby is old enough to sleep independently before you attempt to co-sleep. If you must, ensure that your bedroom is smoke-free in order to protect your child from secondhand smoke. Plunket can assist with a crib or bassinet for those with a low income.\nSecond-hand cribs\nParents looking to save money might be tempted by a second-hand bassinet, crib, or cradle that they receive from a relative or friend. But, cribs are among of the most common causes of deaths involving nursery products, especially when older ones have missing or damaged parts or have larger spaces between slats (which could lead to suffocation risks). In addition, older mattresses may develop dips and other conditions that could pose danger to your child. And if a crib is old enough to be predated by the safety guidelines in place it may be contaminated by lead paint, and could contain other toxic chemicals.\nIf you are considering a used crib, always look to see if it has been removed from sale by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It's also an excellent idea to determine whether the crib has been painted with water-based paint which is much safer for infants than phthalic or oil paint. Ensure that the mattress is firm, and that it fits comfortably. Babies can easily slip off mattresses that are soft and also present a risk of suffocation.\nBe especially cautious of used bassinets and cradles as well as play yards. All of them should be JPMA-certified, and free of sharp edges that could scratch or poke your baby. Avoid putting blankets, pillows or toys to these products which could create entrapment hazards.\nInfants have died in cribs that were altered or tampered with. The majority of these deaths occurred when parents or caregivers tried to make the cribs functional or more attractive by adding or modifying items. Since 1973, crib makers and the CPSC have teamed up to establish standards that are mandatory for cribs that are safer, and have addressed issues like side height, slat spacing, corner posts, mattress fit and cutouts on end panels. In the last few years the number of deaths attributed to cribs has dropped from 150 to 200 per year to just 50.\nBaby bedside cribs let parents keep their newborn close during the night without compromising on safety.
