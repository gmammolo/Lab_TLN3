  "text": "Longmont’s Trail Ridge Middle School is expanding its Unified programs by creating the district’s first middle school Unified Theater program.\nStudent Fernando Arroyo plays a pixie in Trail Ridge Middle School’s first Unified Theater show. He and the other actors rehearsed Thursday at the school. (Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer) Trail Ridge drama teacher Lindsay Sullivan said she wanted to build on the school’s successful Unified sports program and used the inclusive theater programs at Frederick and Niwot high schools as models. As in other Unified programs, general education students are paired with students with disabilities as mentors.\n“Theater is for everyone,” Sullivan said. “Theater is a place where every kid, regardless of their abilities, can find community and talent and acceptance. The more inclusive we are, the more amazing things we can create. I’m really proud of what the students have done.”\nThe program’s first production, “The Enchanted Garden,” will debut at 5 p.m. Friday at the school, 1000 Button Rock Drive. The fairytale-themed play, written by Sullivan, celebrates friendship and kindness with roles tailored to highlight the strengths of each student actor.\nSullivan said she asked students in the Unified program what kind of story they wanted to see, and the consensus was a fairy tale. Her play tells the story of best friends Luna and Soren, who leave their small village to enter an enchanted forest so they can make a wish for more friends. After making friends with a pixie, wind spirit and firefly, they no longer need to wish for new friends because they’ve already found them.\nShe kept the play short, at about 25 minutes. To accommodate students with physical challenges, the play uses limited set pieces. Some actors also have simplified lines and, in one case, an actor has a student helper to read lines to him if needed.\nAlong with drama students and students in the Unified club, the school’s new theater tech class is helping with the production. Altogether, about 20 students are involved.\nSeventh grader Elijah Young is the assistant director for “The Enchanted Garden” and previously acted in other Trail Ridge plays.\n“I’ve always wanted to see what it was like to be a director,” he said. “I’ve always wanted to help out on stage.”\nWhile helping direct can be challenging because “there are some goofballs” in the production, he’s enjoying his role. He added that he was a little nervous initially about working with students with disabilities, but quickly realized “they were just normal people, so I talk to them like normal people.”\n“I hope we can inspire other middle schools that they can do this,” he said.\nAvery Howard, left, and Hero Martin, rehearse a scene on Thursday at Trail Ridge Middle School in Longmont. (Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer) Eighth grader Avery Howard, who is playing Luna, has been a student mentor in the Unified program since sixth grade. She said she found out about the program from her mom, who is one of the school’s special education teachers. Her advice to her Unified partner in the play is to “pretend you’re a princess.”\n“It’s been really fun,” she said.\nSeventh grader Vivian Sebring, who is part of the tech crew, said she took a tech theater class because “I like making stuff happen.” She added she appreciates how easygoing the actors with disabilities are during rehearsals.\n“If they make a mistake, they’re like ‘oops,’ and try again,” she said.\nClassmate Mal Brickley, who is helping with lights, sound and props, said there were a few technical malfunctions during the dress rehearsal, “but it’s nothing we can’t fix.”\n“A Unified play is a great way to include all of our community,” Mal said.",
