  "text": "WKU receives $2 million from the Robert and Mary Tincher Charitable Foundation Inc.\nBOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - During a Board of Regents meeting, the Robert and Mary Tincher Charitable Foundation Inc. presented Western Kentucky University with a $2 million gift.\nEstablished by Robert and Mary Tincher, the Robert and Mary Tincher Charitable Foundation Inc. is a private foundation located in Bowling Green. According to the press release, the foundation has been a supporter of WKU for decades. T\nThe institution has also contributed to scholarships, the Hilltopper Athletic Foundation, and the Chandler Memorial Chapel.\nThe donation established two new endowed scholarships: the Robert and Mary Tincher Housing Scholarship and the Robert and Mary Tincher Lady Topper Housing Scholarship.\nIn honor of the gift, the Board of Regents voted to approve the renaming of a residence hall, which will be announced at a future date.\n“Bob and Mary Tincher were two of the most generous people that I have ever known,” said Joe Bill Campbell, general counsel of the Tincher Charitable Foundation in a press release. “They loved this community. They didn’t have any children, and they considered this community to be their family.”\nAccording to Amanda Trabue, Vice President for Philanthropy & Alumni Engagement, the gift honors the legacy of Robert and Mary Tincher and their deep passion for WKU.\n“What amazing news from two amazing people who just loved this university,” said President Timothy C. Caboni in a press release.\nThe WKU Board of Regents will next meet on Friday, January 24, 2025, to conduct committee meetings.\nCopyright 2024 WBKO. All rights reserved.",
