  "text": "By Alex Kienlen ,\n3 hours ago\nCONWAY, Ark. – A University of Central Arkansas professor received a volunteer of the year award on Thursday for her work in Senegal.\nProfessor and Global Learning Specialist Riva Brown received the award from the Farmer-to-Farmer (F2F) organization after her nomination by Winrock International in July. Her nomination came after she traveled to Senegal to give digital marketing training to Kawral Rewbe Gourel Hadji members, a women’s organization dedicated to producing organic moringa and hibiscus.\nUCA officials speak on new peer recovery support program aiming to fight opioid crisis Brown’s volunteer work included a five-day workshop on website creation, social media optimization and digital marketing.\n“I was very surprised because it was my first time as a Winrock volunteer, and I did not know there was an award,” Brown said. “Preparing for and during the volunteer experience, I was laser-focused on doing a good job because I wanted to make sure that I represented America and Arkansas well.”\nRiva Brown\nBrown was one of nine worldwide who received the award.\nNew UN aid chief vows ‘ruthlessness’ to prioritize spending as funding for world’s crises shrinks Funding for F2F comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to provide technical assistance from U.S. volunteers to farmers, farm groups, agribusinesses and other agriculture institutions. The program was designated as the “John Ogonowski and Doug Bereuter Farmer-to-Farmer Program” of one of the pilots killed Sept. 11, 2001, and of former Rp. Bereuter (R-Nebraska), who initially sponsored the program.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.
