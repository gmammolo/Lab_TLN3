  "text": "Students Connect with NASA Astronaut Via Virtual Session A group of students from Sunita L. Williams Elementary School in Needham, Massachusetts, had an exciting opportunity to engage with NASA astronaut Sunita Williams through a virtual discussion. During this interactive session, students were curious about various aspects of living and working in space.\nHow Astronauts Drink in Space During the session, one student posed an intriguing question regarding the challenges of drinking fluids in a weightless environment. In response, Williams demonstrated the unique method astronauts use to consume liquids while in space, captivating the attention of the young audience.\nSpace Mission Update Currently, Sunita Williams and her colleague Barry “Butch” Wilmore are marking six months aboard the International Space Station. They are participants in a mission that initially aimed to be a week-long test flight aboard Boeing’s newly developed Starliner capsule. However, due to unexpected delays linked to the spacecraft, their return to Earth has been postponed until February.\nThis hands-on experience not only provided the students with insights into the life of an astronaut but also sparked their interest in space exploration and science.",
