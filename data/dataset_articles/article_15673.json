  "text": "Virginia Union makes history, advances to NCAA quarterfinals\n[Free Press staff report](http://richmondfreepress.com/staff/free-press-staff-report/) |\n12/5/2024, 6 p.m.\nVirginia Union University’s record-setting football season continued with a decisive 44-12 victory over Lenoir-Rhyne University on Saturday in the NCAA Division II Playoffs second round.\nJada Byers led the Panthers with 185 rushing yards and two touchdowns, while Curtis Allen added 132 yards and two scores. The game marked the first time since 2021 that two VUU players rushed for more than 100 yards in a single contest.\nWith the win at Moretz Stadium, the Panthers (10-3) earned their first-ever trip to the NCAA Playoff Quarterfinals. They will face Valdosta State on Saturday, Dec. 7, at 1 p.m. in Valdosta, Ga.\n“I said back in August that this was a team that could compete for the National Championship,” VUU head coach Alvin Parker said.\n“Now we’re one of eight teams still playing. We’re blessed to have a group that stayed the course, remained locked in and played some great football.”\nQuarterback RJ Rosales contributed to the offensive onslaught, completing 10 of 17 passes for 179 yards and a touchdown while adding a rushing score. Reginald Vick Jr. hauled in three passes for 122 yards, including a touchdown. On defense, Jalen Mayo led with nine tackles.\nThe Panthers took a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter on an Allen rushing touchdown. Although Lenoir-Rhyne (10-3) briefly responded with a 47-yard touchdown catch by Adonis McDaniel,\nVUU blocked the extra point and dominated the rest of the game. By halftime, the Panthers had extended their lead to 20-6 and controlled the pace until the final whistle.\nLenoir-Rhyne’s season came to a close despite a strong effort from wide receiver George Futch, who recorded four catches for 36 yards and a touchdown.\nThis victory marks a milestone for VUU football, as the team advances deeper into the playoffs than ever before.",
