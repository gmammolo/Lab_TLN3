  "text": "OpenAI⁢ envisions a future​ where online⁣ learning is enhanced by the power of artificial intelligence,wiht chatbots playing a key role in personalized education.\nSiya Raj Purohit, a member of OpenAI’s go-to-market team for education, shared this vision during a recent fireside chat hosted by Coeus collective. Purohit suggested that OpenAI might develop tools allowing e-learning instructors⁢ to create ⁢customized “GPTs” tailored to their specific online curriculums.\n“What I’m hoping is going to happen is that professors are going to ⁣create custom GPTs for the public and let people engage with content in a lifelong manner,” Purohit said. “It’s not part of the ⁤current work that we’re doing, but it’s definitely on the roadmap.”\nPurohit‍ noted that she has already observed professors utilizing OpenAI’s existing tools to ‍upload an entire semester’s worth of ​content and create​ custom GPTs for their⁣ students. ⁤”Students engage‍ with that finite knowledge … [which] I⁣ think is a really powerful‍ and good way to let them ‍research,” she added.\nOpenAI’s ‌Siya Raj Purohit (right), being interviewed by Coeus Collective CEO antonio DiMeglio (left) at Pace University ‌in NYC. Image Credits: Coeus Collective OpenAI is actively pursuing the education market, recognizing its immense potential⁢ for growth. In September,the company appointed Leah Belsky,former chief⁣ revenue officer of Coursera,as‍ its frist education GM,tasking her with​ expanding OpenAI’s presence in schools. Earlier this year, OpenAI launched ChatGPT ⁢Edu, a version of ‌ChatGPT specifically⁤ designed for universities.\nMarket‌ research indicates a promising future for AI in education. ​Allied Market Research predicts the market could⁣ reach a staggering $88.2 billion globally by 2032. However, the initial growth has been somewhat ⁣slow, partly due to reservations among educators.\nThe ​world of education ‌is ⁣on the cusp of a technological revolution, with artificial intelligence (AI) poised⁤ to transform⁢ the way students learn. While the potential benefits are vast, concerns remain about​ the readiness ‌of AI for widespread classroom adoption.\nImagine⁤ a personalized ⁤learning companion, capable of⁢ providing tailored guidance and support to each student. This is the vision driving the ⁣development of “GPTs” – generative pre-trained transformers – designed specifically for educational purposes. These⁣ AI-powered tools could offer students assistance ‌with homework, test preparation, and even provide insights into ⁣complex concepts.\nKhanmigo, a chatbot developed by the e-learning platform Khan Academy in collaboration with OpenAI, offers a glimpse into‍ this future. Integrated with Khan Academy’s vast library of educational content, Khanmigo can provide students with personalized‍ support ‌and guidance. However,as⁢ with any emerging technology,there are challenges to overcome.\nWhen tested by The Wall Street‍ Journal earlier this year,​ Khanmigo‍ demonstrated some limitations. The ⁢chatbot struggled with basic math problems and sometimes failed to ⁣correct errors when asked to double-check ⁢its solutions.\n“All of our models keep getting better, ⁤and​ our goal is to help translate that into what works ​in learning and teaching,”\nDespite these early⁤ hurdles, developers remain ⁣optimistic about⁤ the future of AI in education. Priya⁤ Purohit, a‌ researcher at Google DeepMind, emphasizes the continuous advancement of these models.\nHowever, educators remain cautious. A recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that a⁣ quarter of public K-12 teachers believe AI tools do more harm than good⁢ in the classroom. Similarly, a poll conducted by the Rand Corporation and the Center ⁣on Reinventing Public Education found that ​only 18% of K-12 educators are currently using AI in their teaching.\nThe debate surrounding AI in education is complex, with ⁤valid⁣ concerns on both sides. As technology continues to evolve, it will be crucial to ​carefully consider the ethical implications ⁢and ensure that AI tools are used responsibly ⁢to enhance, rather than replace, the vital role of human ​educators.\n## World ‌Today ⁤News: Exclusive Interview with ⁤OpenAI on the​ Future of⁣ Online Learning\n**By ⁤ [Your Name], Senior Editor**\n**San Francisco, ​CA -** ⁢ The landscape of‍ online ⁢education is poised for a significant conversion as artificial intelligence takes center stage.OpenAI, ⁣a leading force in the field, envisions a future ‌where⁤ chatbots act as ⁣personalized learning ‍companions, ⁤revolutionizing how students interact with educational ⁢content.\n**Siya Raj Purohit**, a member of OpenAI’s ⁣go-to-market‌ team for education, recently⁢ shared this compelling ⁣vision during⁣ a ‍fireside chat hosted by Coeus Collective at Pace University in New York City.
