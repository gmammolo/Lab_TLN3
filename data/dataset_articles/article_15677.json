The committee ‌approved advertising for the Kosciusko County Health Department’s Early Start ‍Prenatal Clinic on two local ⁤radio stations in English for⁣ six and‍ three-month periods, respectively, totaling $5,400. An additional $1,680 was allocated for three ‌months of Spanish-language advertising on another ‌station. Lauri ‍Westerhof was approved as ‍a school health liaison at an estimated cost of $78,000, with an additional $10,000 available​ if needed.⁣ Westerhof will facilitate interaction between ⁤the health department and six local school corporations: Sacred Heart ‍Elementary​ School, Lakeland Christian School, Warsaw Community Schools, Tippecanoe Valley School Corp.,Whitko Community Schools,and wawasee Community School Corp.

It can ‍also play a crucial ‌role in managing chronic conditions like arthritis and diabetes. Additionally, these classes can foster a sense of community and combat social isolation, which are critical for⁢ mental and emotional well-being.\n**World Today News**: How will these classes be funded?\n**Amy ⁢Roe**: We ‌are currently exploring ​various funding options, including grants, partnerships‌ with local businesses ⁢and‌ organizations, and potentially community fundraising efforts. Our priority⁣ is to make ⁢these classes as accessible and affordable as possible‍ for all seniors.\n**World Today News**: What is⁤ the ⁤timeline for implementing this project?\n**Amy Roe**: We are⁤ hopeful that with the ‌committee’s approval and secured funding,⁤ we can launch‌ these classes ⁢within the first‍ quarter of next year.
