  "text": "Gov. Bill Lee has appointed a Walters State student to serve as the student regent on the Tennessee Board of Regents, the governing body for the state’s community colleges and colleges of applied technology. -\nCayden Keltgen, a nursing major from Talbott, will serve through July 1, 2025.\n“Cayden is an outstanding student,” said Dr. Tony Miksa, president of Walters State. “He is very dedicated to his studies, the college community and the field of nursing. I know he will be just as dedicated to his work as a regent, and I congratulate him on this honor.”\nKeltgen is a member of the Walters State Debate Team, winning awards at tournaments across the state. He previously served as a tutor in both the tutoring lab and in the speech lab. He was actually studying political science in Amsterdam as part of the college’s study abroad program when he learned he had been chosen by the governor.\n“I submitted my application with no expectations,” Keltgen said. “I applied with hopes that I could have an impact on the 100,000 students served by the board. I am going to try to find as much information as possible about issues and also listen to students”\nHaving an impact is important to Keltgen – whether it’s giving advice to a novice debater or taking care of patients during his job as a patient tech at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. He hopes to work as a nurse in an intensive care unit.\n“My patients may not remember my name, but I will be able to leave every day knowing I have made a difference.”\nHe’s approaching his new role as a regent with the same passion.\n“I am interested in improving access to underserved populations, especially for nontraditional students seeking to attend nursing school,” Keltgen said. He has been assigned to the workforce development committee.\nKeltgen will graduate with an associate of applied science in nursing and an associate of science in health studies in May. His tuition has been paid by Tennessee Promise and a debate scholarship.",
