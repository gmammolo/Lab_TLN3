  "text": "Washburn Tech to open manufacturing institute at former Kmart in North Topeka\nWashburn Institute of Technology is opening a manufacturing institute in North Topeka.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Washburn University Board of Regents unanimously approved the purchase of the former Kmart building at 2240 N.W. Tyler St. The purchase price was $2 million.\n“Through utilization of an existing structure, Washburn Tech has the ability to refurbish a large portion of the building while still preserving room to grow in the future and continue to respond to the state’s workforce needs,” said Scott Smathers, Washburn Tech dean, in a written statement. “We believe this is the best option for investing state and donor dollars, as well as the best way to serve students and prepare them for careers that are high-pay and high-demand.”\nBringing a manufacturing program to Topeka\nWashburn Tech is expanding now because of a growing manufacturing industry in Kansas.\n“Washburn Tech is committed to our local manufacturing partners and their growing need for a highly skilled workforce,” said Washburn president JuliAnn Mazachek, in a written statement. “Our new Manufacturing Institute will allow us to expand existing programs, launch new pathways, repurpose a vacant structure and strengthen our connection to the northern part of the community.”\nHow the former Kmart facility will be used\nAll of the Topeka locations for Kmart closed due to liquidation. The\n[North Topeka location](https://www.cjonline.com/story/news/local/2016/01/12/kmart-north-topeka-close-liquidation-sale-begins-jan-24/16604575007/) closed in 2016.\nMazachek said Washburn Tech intends to save costs by using some pre-existing features of the 90,000-square-foot property.\n“North Topeka is a thriving sector of our community and conveniently located for many of our adult students as well as students from more than 40 Northeast Kansas high schools,” Mazachek said. “The Manufacturing Institute in North Topeka is an exciting next step in providing the best academic experience for our students while continuing to strengthen the pipeline of workers required to fuel our economy.”\nPlanning and construction will begin in early 2025.\nThe existing Washburn Tech facilities at 5724 S.W. Huntoon Ave. and 2014 S.E. Washington St. will continue to operate.\n(This story was updated to add new information.)",
