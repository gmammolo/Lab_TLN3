  "text": "Molly Weithman made a strong and quick adjustment from high school to collegiate cross-country this fall as a freshman for the College of William and Mary women’s team.\nThe Bishop O’Connell High School graduate and standout runner wound up as the top-finishing freshman for William and Mary at the recent NCAA Division I Southeast Regional meet . She placed 89th in 22:20.5 in the 6K event, and was the team’s third finisher.\nAt the preceding Coastal Athletic Association championships , Weithman finished 15th (21:30.1) to help William and Mary place second. Prior to those two postseason meets, Weithman placed 26th (21:31.4) at the Panorama Farms Invitational near Charlottesville.\nWeithman was a standout in cross-country and track-and-field at O’Connell, one of the most accomplished ever for the girls programs. She won multiple state championships in the two sports.\nDuring the fall cross-country seasons, Weithman was a multiple-time Arlington County champion.\nO’Connell cross country and track and field coach Jim Connor was confident Weithman would do well and adjust quickly to longer college cross-country races.",
