  "text": "Pasadena Unified teachers and principals received more than $206,000 in grants thanks to the Pasadena Educational Foundation (PEF), College Football Playoff (CFP) Foundation, and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association at this year’s PEF Teacher Grants Celebration & Parade.\nThe grants, awarded annually, benefit thousands of students in the public schools of Altadena, Pasadena, and Sierra Madre.\nBorn from award presentations in the COVID years, teachers formed a block-long line of cars outside the Hudson Avenue headquarters of the Pasadena Unified School District and drove through a balloon arch to receive their certificates and checks, accompanied by cheers and music.\n“This is one of the best days of the year for us,” said Dr. Patrick Conyers, PEF Executive Director. “We’re giving out $ 206,000 in grants to 238 educators from donations made by local residents and supporters. We’re grateful to our donors and to our partners at the College Football Playoff Foundation and the Pasadena Tournament of Roses for their support in making this program possible.”\nThe Pasadena Educational Foundation has supported teachers and principals by funding innovative and creative classroom projects for 50 years. With the support of its community partners, PEF ensures that students across Altadena, Pasadena, and Sierra Madre benefit from enriched learning experiences.\nThis year, 148 Teacher Grants and 10 School-Wide Grants were awarded to 238 educators. At least one teacher from every PUSD campus received a grant this year.\nTeacher Grants were relatively small, ranging from ukuleles to iPads, while larger school-wide grants were awarded to principals for projects that benefit all students at their school.\nIn addition to the teacher and principal grants, three additional special awards were presented Wednesday.\nThe Calvin Hunt Arts Award was presented to Dany Richey, Sirvard Ogtanyan, and Christina An of Sierra Madre Elementary for their project, Superhero Social-Emotional Learning & STEAM. Inspired by the book Tar Beach by Faith Ringgold, students will imagine themselves as superheroes and create their own sidekick pal robots to support them on their life journey.\nThe Jarratt Brunson Memorial Award for Literacy was awarded to Lauren Partma of Don Benito Elementary for her project, Novel Notions, which will build a culturally diverse classroom library. Students will engage with the books through small reading groups and read-aloud sessions.\nThe Kathy Onoye Principal’s Leadership Award was presented to Maria Toliver and Patricia J. Gwinn of McKinley School for the Arts for their project, McKinley Library Revitalization (Phase 2). This initiative builds on last year’s library renovation by expanding the collection of student-centered books to further enhance student learning. The McKinley Library renovation was made possible with support from PEF, the College Football Playoff Foundation, the Tournament of Roses.\nA complete list of awardees is available at[ ](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pased.org/teachers&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733407942847429&usg=AOvVaw2yG08bb9n8XNq2oFmZExWJ)[pased.org/teachers](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pased.org/teachers&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1733407942847859&usg=AOvVaw3kNsKcyDLB2S9ylMUWDZCV).\nMake a comment\nTop of the News\n[\nCommunity News\n](https://pasadenanow.com/main/members-file-complaint-against-alleged-election-irregularities-in-naacp-presidents-race)\nMembers File Complaint Against Alleged Election Irregularities in NAACP President’s Race\n[\nGovernment\n](https://pasadenanow.com/main/human-relations-commission-recommends-city-council-commemorate-nuclear-attack-on-hiroshima)",
