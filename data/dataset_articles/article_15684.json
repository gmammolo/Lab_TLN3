  "text": "Funding Supports Five Projects Across Upstate To Provide Valuable Skills to 2,100 Trainees for More Than 30 Business Partners\nTo Date, More Than $60 Million Awarded To Train Nearly 15,000 New Yorkers\nGovernor Kathy Hochul today announced the New York State Office of Strategic Workforce Development has awarded more than $15.5 million in additional grants to support five projects across Upstate New York through the Workforce Development Capital and Pay for Performance Operating Grant Programs. These grants will support the training of more than 2,100 workers through collaboration between training providers and more than 30 employer partners in high demand fields such as advanced manufacturing, construction, nanotechnology, and clean and renewable energy. The Office, which operates under Empire State Development, supports industry-driven workforce development programs and practices to ensure that more New Yorkers have the skills for good, family sustaining jobs in the state's fastest growing industries.\n“A pillar of my administration is to help New Yorkers put money in their pockets and part of that strategy is to ensure that more New Yorkers have the skills needed so they can have good paying jobs in growth industries throughout the state,\" Governor Hochul said. \"By growing and expanding access to workforce development programs that provide training and address traditional barriers to employment, we are generating new opportunities for more residents to earn good wages – especially in historically-marginalized communities. These grants will support critical Upstate projects and offer even more people the transformational skills they need to succeed and thrive in the 21st century.\"\nThe seventh round of awards from the Office of Strategic Workforce Development brings the total state investment to nearly $60 million that will leverage more than $65 million in public and private funding and support over 14,400 trainees for over 2,000 business partners.\nThe grants awarded to five projects today will support employer-driven, high-skilled workforce training programs and reward innovative approaches and best practices that reduce the barriers to participation for high-need communities. The $115 million Pay for Performance Operating Grant Program has flexible funding to help providers cover programmatic expenses like curriculum development and wraparound services to prepare New Yorkers with in-demand skills and industry-recognized credentials. The $35 million Workforce Development Capital Grant Program supports the capital needs of workforce training providers that seek to enhance or expand their offerings. These grant programs allow workforce training providers to expand the capacity of successful programs with high placement rates and effective wraparound services.\nEmpire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, \"The Office of Strategic Workforce Development continues to utilize crucial public-private partnerships to create new pathways to job and skills training, further supporting New York's pipeline of trained employees for high-growth industries. Working with our partner programs, we are committed to supporting trainees in their success and to growing a more diverse economy throughout the state.\"\nRead the full press release [here](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/training-new-yorkers-good-paying-jobs-future-governor-hochul-announces-more-155-million).",
