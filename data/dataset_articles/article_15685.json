  "text": "District News,\nStudent Newson December 5, 2024\nApply for scholarships over winter break\nAttention high school students. Is “applying for college scholarships” on your winter break to-do list? If not, you need to add it! Take advantage of your free time over the holidays to set yourself up for a great future. And keep reading to find scholarships and get tips on how to apply.\nIf you don’t know what scholarships to apply for, that’s not a problem. Finding scholarships is easy thanks to the Arlington ISD’s guidance and counseling department. Students can apply for scholarships year-round by checking out the scholarships page and choosing which ones they qualify for.\nThere is a scholarship for everyone. Do you have a green thumb and plan to major in horticulture? Are you first in your family to pursue college, or are you an active member in Boy Scouts? Did you participate in the Dan Dipert Career and Technical Center culinary arts and hospitality program, or are you currently enrolled in a STEM-related career pathway?\nThere are scholarships for all those students and a whole lot more. Really – there’s a scholarship for everyone. But you have to apply. So, go check out the district’s scholarship page, look at the info below about the scholarships for Arlington ISD students offered by the Greater Arlington Chamber of Commerce, and read the tips about applying for scholarships below from Arlington ISD director of guidance and counseling Telisa Brown.\nThe Greater Arlington Chamber Scholarships\nThe Greater Arlington Chamber Scholarship Program awards $20,000 in scholarships each year to graduating seniors in the Arlington ISD to attend a college or university of their choice.\nEight $2,500 scholarships will be awarded to one graduating senior from each of the six traditional high schools and the two early college high schools.\nApplicants are required to complete the online application, write an essay based on the essay topic provided and upload all of the supporting documents.\nApplications Due: Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. CST Apply here.\nScholarship Tips\nArlington ISD director of guidance and counseling Telisa Brown has a few tips for students (and parents) planning to apply for scholarships:\n- Start Early\nBegin researching scholarships well in advance. Many scholarships have early deadlines, so starting early ensures you don’t miss out on opportunities.\n- Organize Deadlines\nCreate a calendar to track application deadlines and prioritize those with the earliest due dates.\n- Focus on Fit\nLook for scholarships that align with your strengths, interests and experiences. For example, consider awards for academic achievement, community service, sports or unique talents.\n- Do not Ignore Small Awards\nEvery amount will help and add up.\n- Gather items needed to apply for a scholarship early, like your transcript, completed FAFSA documents, resume, recommendation letters and essays.\nYou may need these documents to reference while completing applications.\n- Maximize Financial Aid Knowledge\nEnsure the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is completed early to qualify for federal, state and school-based aid. Visit the Arlington ISD financial aid website for additional information to complete your FAFSA application.\n- Gather Strong Recommendations Early\nSome scholarships require letters of recommendation. Identify Recommenders: Ask teachers, counselors or mentors who know you well and can provide a strong, personalized letter. Share a resume, transcript or a list of accomplishments to help recommenders write detailed letters. Give your recommenders no less than two weeks to prepare.\n- Gloat! Sing your own praises!\nThis is a time to brag about all the great things you are doing academically and within the community.\n- Stay Persistent\nDon’t get discouraged by rejection. Apply to as many scholarships as possible to increase chances of success. By staying organized, proactive and persistent you can tackle the scholarship application process successfully.\nBrown also emphasizes the importance of staying connected with your school counselor and visiting your campus Go Center. Both resources play a vital role in helping students plan for college, apply for scholarships and prepare for post-secondary opportunities.\nGood luck!",
