  "text": "While most of Grand Valley’s campuses went remote due to heavy snowfalls on Thursday, the GVSU Police Academy proceeded with its 54th graduating class celebration as planned. It took some alterations to the agenda, but the academy made a point to hold its graduation ceremony in person at the Loosemore Auditorium on the Pew Grand Rapids Campus.\n“The recruits are going to be expected to go in and work every day, regardless of whether there’s snow or anything else,” said Geoffrey Collard, director of the GVSU Police Academy, referring to the commitment to keeping the ceremony in person. “It’s really the first day of a true sacrifice in the profession.”\nThirty-nine of the 41 recruits to go through the 54th academy graduated, with injury preventing two from completing their training. All 39 of the graduates were sponsored through the academy or have received conditional offers of employment from law enforcement agencies across the state.\n“Our program not only incorporates the fundamental training in policing, but we’ve also, over the years, started to evolve that curriculum into incorporating a number of different contemporary approaches that are now appropriate with the world in which you will face as a graduate and move into your roles as police officers,” said Paul Stansbie, GVSU professor and former associate dean of the College of Education and Community Innovation.\nStansbie highlighted education in unbiased policing, decision-making, mental health training, law enforcement and the LGBTQ-plus community, and mediation and restorative practices as additional hours put in beyond the minimum standards required by MCOLES.",
