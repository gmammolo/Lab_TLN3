  "text": "The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), mark a significant occasion as it celebrates 120 years since its creation.\nFounded in London by a group of eight accountants on November 30, 1904, it has since grown into a global network of more than 252,500 members and 526,000 future members across 180 countries.\nACCA President Ayla Majid said; “By staying true to our founding value of inclusion, ACCA has become a truly global organisation, working for the public good. When ACCA was founded in 1904, nobody could have predicted how much we’d achieve. Our story has been one of innovation and growth. But above all, it’s a story of more people’s careers launched, lives transformed and many dreams come true.’\n“We have an amazing community of talented and committed members around the world undertaking successful careers and making positive and sustainable impact on countless businesses, organisations and communities, creating huge benefits for the global economy.”\nThe election of Ayla Majid to the office of President at the recent AGM, along with Melanie Proffitt as Deputy President and Datuk Zaiton Mohd Hassan as Vice President, makes this the first time in ACCA’s history that women have held all three officer posts at the same time.\nIt’s another milestone for the professional accountancy body, which was the first to admit women to membership in 1909.\nHelen Brand OBE, Chief Executive of ACCA, remarked; “2024 has truly been a landmark year for us. In May our membership numbers exceeded a quarter of a million. In September we launched our new Professional Diploma in Sustainability.”\n“Earlier this month we were recognised with a special nomination in the international category of the UN Trade and Development which recognised our work to improve reporting and skills capacity building on sustainability.”\nACCA Head of South Asia Nilusha Ranasinghe said; “ACCA’s remarkable 120-year journey is a testament to the transformative power of purpose, vision and resilience. From its inception, ACCA has redefined the accounting profession by championing inclusivity, innovation and integrity. As custodians of this extra ordinary legacy, we honour the visionaries who laid the foundation for a profession that continues to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing world.”\n“Today, with over 250,000 members worldwide, we celebrate our rich history and key milestones, including being named Professional Body of the Year and shortlisted for the ESG/Sustainability Initiative of the Year.”\n“These achievements reflect our unwavering commitment to excellence, sustainability, and ethical leadership. As we mark this milestone, it is not merely a celebration of the past but a call to action to reimagine and shape a sustainable, inclusive future for the profession and the world it serves.”",
