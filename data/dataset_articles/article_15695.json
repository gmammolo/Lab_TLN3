  "text": "Venerable Wadigala Samitharathana Thero has become the first Sri Lankan Buddhist monk to study at Britain’s prestigious University of Oxford in 105 years.\nThe Thera is currently reading for an MPhil in Buddhist Studies as a Glorisun Scholar at St. Cross College, University of Oxford.\nHe studied oriental languages (Sinhala, Pali, and Sanskrit) and other co-related literature (philology, etymology, grammar, semantics, metrics and prosody, logic and reasoning, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc.) at Siri Sunanda Pirivena, Beliatta and Mahavihara Maha Pirivena, Kandy in Sri Lanka.\nThe Venerable Thero was awarded the ‘National First Prize’ (with a Korean Government Scholarship) for the highest marks in the Buddhist Religious Final Examination in 2013 and the academic honour of ‘Royal Pandita’ remarking the successful completion of oriental studies in Ceylon in 2016.\nHe had started reading for a BA (Hons) in Philosophy at the University of Peradeniya in 2019, whilst studying the Pali canon, exegetical commentaries, Vedic, non-Vedic, and Buddhist Sanskrit texts.\nFurther, in recognition of his exceptional achievements in Buddhist studies, the International Buddhist College in Thailand offered him the ‘Outstanding Young Buddhist Scholar Award’ in 2017.\nHe also received an offer from Oxford Brookes University, along with an International Student Scholarship Award to complete the final two years of the current programme.\nAccordingly, he took the opportunity and earned a BA (Hons) in Philosophy in submitting a dissertation titled ‘Aristotle and Buddhism: A Comparative Study between the Aristotelian Concept of Eudaimonia and the Buddhist Perspective of Nibbana’ in 2023.\nThe Thero received the Tibet Foundation Award, whereby he pursued an MA in Buddhist Studies at SOAS University of London in 2024. Therein, he carried out a breakthrough study on ‘Buddhaghosa’s Critique of Meditation (Visuddhimagga): An Emphasis on Ethics, Epistemology, and Metaphysics in Buddhist Meditation’.\nVen. Samitharathana Thero has given several paper presentations at International Research Conferences worldwide held in Zürich, Paris, Oxford, Cambridge, Madrid, Berlin, New York, Colombo, and Kandy, over the past years.\nHe founded the Oxford Buddhist Society to preserve Theravada Buddhism for the sake of human well-being, and is now playing a vital role as the Founding President.\nIn Michaelmas Term 2024, Ven. Samitharathana Thero matriculated to the University of Oxford (alongside the membership at St. Cross College) as a Glorisun Scholar – since he was awarded the Glorisun Graduate Scholarship towards the MPhil in Buddhist Studies this year.",
