  "text": "The Diana Award, established in memory of Diana, Princess of Wales, continues to honor young changemakers making exceptional contributions to social action and humanitarian efforts.\nThis year’s ceremony marked a special milestone—the 25th anniversary of The Diana Award—and celebrated 200 extraordinary young leaders from across 45 countries. These recipients, honored during a virtual ceremony, were recognized for their transformative work in their communities, their dedication to driving lasting change, and their commitment to creating a fairer, more equitable world.\nPrince Harry appeared at the virtual ceremony in a recorded message, joined by Legacy Award recipients Chiara Riyanti Hutapea Zhang from Indonesia and Christina Williams from Jamaica. The Duke of Sussex paid tribute to the recipients, saying, “I know my mum would be incredibly proud of you guys.”\nReflecting on the legacy of Diana, Princess of Wales, he added, “My mother’s belief in the power of young people to drive positive change continues to inspire me every single day. No matter the challenges we face, whether it is climate change, mental health, or systemic injustices, her legacy and the efforts of young people to inspire further action in the world fill me with hope.”\nFor 25 years, The Diana Award has celebrated young changemakers who embody Princess Diana’s unwavering belief in the power of youth to inspire meaningful transformation. Supported by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, the award continues to shine a light on those whose courage and determination are a beacon of hope for others.\nA heartfelt congratulations to all the winners in this landmark anniversary year. Your remarkable achievements and commitment to making the world a better place are truly inspirational.",
