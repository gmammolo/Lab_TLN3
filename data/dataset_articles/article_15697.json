  "text": "Sulphur teacher wins Milken Educator Award\nLAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - Maplewood Middle School’s band director Kyle Cook received a big surprise today for his achievements as an educator.\nCook was one of three recipients in the state to receive the Milken Educator Award, which was created in 1987 in California to celebrate, elevate and activate the teaching profession.\nCook says he wasn’t expecting to be recognized.\n“We were told today would just be an assembly,” Cook said. “We knew we had some special guests coming and it was going to be a great time.”\nHe said he was filled with emotion the moment he heard his name announced.\n“I’m just very grateful. I’ve been here for a long time and I’ve loved this school. I’ve loved working with all my kids and just to see something like this - it recognizes the hard work my kids do,” said Cook.\nThis recognition comes with an unrestricted financial award of $25,000.\nCook, who is originally from Texas, moved to Lake Charles for college, and has been at Maplewood Middle since he graduated. He says he’s always known teaching was his destiny, but it wasn’t until high school that he realized it was also his passion.\n“There were so many different avenues out there and then when I went to high school, I thought, ‘Okay, who has given me the most impact on my life?’ It was my band directors,” Cook said.\nMusic gave him a purpose, he said and band provided him with a place to succeed. He says his hope is to provide students with the opportunities he had as a student in school.\n“To me, it creates good humans, good people, good citizens, all these different things that teach them hard work, how to be responsible, how to be respectful, overall just how to be good people of society,” said Cook.\nCook will travel to California in April to accept the award. He will also be honored as Louisiana Jazz Educator of the Year in January in New Orleans.\nTo learn more about the Milken Educator Award, click [here](https://www.milkeneducatorawards.org/about/fact-sheet/).\nCopyright 2024 KPLC.
