  "text": "The university has reappointed Martino Harmon as vice president for student life, extending his contract for five years and granting him a term that will run through June 30, 2030.\n“For the past several years, we’ve been so fortunate to have the outstanding leadership of Martino Harmon, who has led U-M’s Division of Student Life through several efforts to improve and enrich the student experience while emphasizing sustainability and student wellness,” President Santa J. Ono said during the Dec. 5 Board of Regents meeting.\nHarmon joined the university in July 2020 with a focus on student success. Under his leadership, Student Life embarked on a new holistic approach to addressing student health and well-being across the university through the creation of the Well-being Collective, the adoption of the Okanagan Charter as a health-promoting university, and increasing access to student mental health resources.\nHarmon also led the launch of Student Life Sustainability, which works with multiple student organizations to advance sustainability and the university’s carbon neutrality goals.\nHe also has led the approval of three major capital projects currently under construction: the Hadley Family Recreation and Well-Being Center; the Central Campus Residential Development; and the Ginsberg Center for Community Service and Learning.\nAdditionally, Harmon expanded an engagement program for parents and family members to include virtual workshops, electronic newsletters, a new parent and family communications portal, and additional on-campus programming.\n“Michigan is dedicated to delivering the best of the best,” Harmon said. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to continue serving our student community and working with campus partners to promote expanded services that help shape positive and healthy student experiences.”",
