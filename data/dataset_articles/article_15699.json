  "text": "[Montgomery ISD](https://www.misd.org/)will be able to hire additional elementary school staff following the passage of the district’s voter-approval tax rate election\n[on Nov. 5](https://communityimpact.com/houston/conroe-montgomery/election/2024/11/06/montgomery-isd-voters-approve-55-million-vatre/), district leaders announced\n[Dec. 3](https://meetings.boardbook.org/Public/Agenda/2239?meeting=660703).\nThe details\nVoters approved MISD's VATRE, which will\n[provide $5.5 million](https://communityimpact.com/houston/tomball-magnolia/education/2024/09/27/security-among-priorities-in-potential-misd-tax-rate-hike/)in additional revenue as the district faces a nearly $4.3 million budget shortfall. In light of the incoming revenue, MISD will be able to add staff positions at Montgomery and Creekside elementary schools, MISD officials said.\nAccording to MISD’s\n[employment hiring page](https://www.applitrack.com/montgomeryisd/onlineapp/default.aspx?Category=Elementary), the positions posted after the Nov. 5 election for both schools include:\n- Two special education paraprofessionals at Montgomery Elementary School\n- One teacher each for first and third grade at Creekside Elementary School\n- One teacher each for fourth and fifth grade at Montgomery Elementary School\nMISD leaders asked teachers at both schools—some of who have up to 28 students per class while most other MISD classes have 22 students per class—whether they want additional staff hired before the end of the 2024-25 school year, Superintendent Mark Ruffin said Dec. 3. Staff asked for additional help as soon as possible, so the new positions will start in January, if employees can be found, he said.\nAngela Bonilla contributed to this report.",
