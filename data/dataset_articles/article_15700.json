  "text": "Lucknow: Experts at the 76th Annual Conference of the Cardiological Society of India (CSI) unveiled new hypertension management guidelines, emphasising lifestyle modifications under medical supervision as the first-line treatment. These modifications include dietary adjustments, regular physical activity, weight management, and reduced alcohol consumption. Prof Bhuwan Tiwari, head of the cardiology department at RMLIMS, explained that the ideal blood pressure is below 120/80 mmHg. For prehypertension, with readings around 140/90, lifestyle changes such as exercise and a balanced diet are often sufficient to manage the condition. However, when blood pressure exceeds these levels, medication may become necessary. \\\"For young individuals without underlying health issues, maintaining blood pressure below 120/80 through lifestyle changes alone should be the goal. In contrast, those who have experienced a heart attack or related complications might require medication even for slightly elevated readings to prevent further risks,\\\" said Prof Tiwari. For individuals encountering fluctuating blood pressure readings at home, experts recommended staying calm and rechecking measurements after a short interval. While a one-time reading of 150/90 could be an error, consistently high readings require medical attention. Regular monitoring and additional tests, such as ECGs and kidney and eye exams, are crucial to assessing the long-term effects of hypertension. Dr A Muruganathan, advisory member of the National Board of Examination, stressed the importance of calibrating home blood pressure monitors with hospital-grade devices for accuracy. He also proposed setting up free BP monitoring stations in public spaces, such as malls, bus stands, and railway stations, to raise awareness about hypertension. Describing hypertension as a \\\"silent killer,\\\" he said that over 33% of Indians suffer from the condition, with many remaining undiagnosed. He suggested making affordable, locally manufactured BP monitors widely accessible, just like mobile phones, to encourage regular monitoring. Additionally, he advocated for establishing specialised hypertension centres, similar to clinics for diabetes or respiratory conditions, to address the growing burden of hypertension in India. \\\"For individuals over 80, slightly higher readings might be acceptable based on overall health, but for others, maintaining a systolic BP of 135 mmHg and diastolic BP of 80 mmHg is ideal,\\\" he added. Dr Sangram S Biradar, a faculty member at Private Medical College Gulbarga, underscored the significant role family members play in managing hypertension. Encouraging healthy eating habits, promoting regular exercise, and ensuring medication adherence can significantly improve blood pressure control. Family members can further assist by preparing low-sodium meals, monitoring BP, and offering emotional support. Dr. Biradar also emphasised the importance of proper techniques for measuring blood pressure.",
