  "text": "By Breanna Rittman ,\n4 hours ago\nBLOOMINGTON, Ill. (WMBD) — The McLean County Museum of History is closer to expanding its digital archives with more film they received from The Pantagraph newspaper.\nThe collection includes more than 3 million film negatives dating back to the 1930s. In 2021, the museum received nearly $100,000 from the state of Illinois to help with the project.\nEvergreen Memorial Cemetery holds its final walk “This collection is really representative of the Midwest, and it’s a rare collection to be made available,” said Norris Porter, the museum’s director of development. “And that’s why researchers and people with a historical bent find it interesting because it is a slice of Midwest Americana.”\nMost recently, with the help of U.S. Sen. Richard “Dick” Durbin, the museum also received a $550,000 congressional grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. This will enable the museum to digitize about 154,000 negatives from 1957 to 1963.\n“Getting through the sixties important because it starts to get through, you know, the Civil Rights Era, too. And getting a lot of that out there shows pictures that we have and also tells the story of pictures that we don’t have. Right. And so this is this is an important step we feel, to get those pictures out there.”\nThe grant is expected to run through September 2027. The current phase of the project total is estimated to be $734,000.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
