  "text": "By Kayleigh Thomas ,\n2 hours ago\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – A program from the Springfield District Court is helping reform emerging adults to disengage from cycles of adversity and justice-system involvement.\nTwo young men were given a second chance at a brand-new life after graduating from the Emerging Adult Court of Hope program. “It means alot just knowing that we have a good support system behind our back,” said graduate, Jomar Rodriguez.\nJomar Rodriguez and Matthew Vaughn are the latest to graduate from the Emerging Adult Court of Hope, also known as EACH. Both were arrested and at risk of potential life-altering conviction, but were given a second chance.\n“It’s easy to gravitate towards like negative activity and negative environment but it just helps you stay afloat,” expressed Rodriguez.\n“We have time hanging over our head and we have to make the right choices continuously and just push forward every day,” added Vaughn.\nThrough education, training, and job placement, this two-year program gives those under the judicial system a chance at a better future. Rodriguez and Vaughn took advantage of this opportunity to stay out of prison and have their case dismissed once they finished and their records sealed. Now they serve as examples of how second chances can lead to success and redemption.\n“This is a big opportunity to just further your future, and be a better person and push positivity,” said Rodriguez.\nRodriguez is currently enrolled at STCC and trying to become a firefighter. And Vaughn is the first graduate to complete an STCC program. He will be entering a career in HVAC.\n“These are careers that they can sustain and grow with and support their family, and it’s going to keep them away from the negativity and lure in the streets that had gotten them in trouble in the past,” said Hampden County DA, Athony Gulluni.\nAnd their success marks another significant milestone for the program, which will have graduated seven participants since its inception, four years ago.\nLocal News Headlines Cooper’s Gifts presents $1200 Check to Awagam Veterans Memorial Cemetery Ribbon cutting for FAV’s Closet opens in Springfield to provide clothes to individuals and families in need Ten Purple Heart signs given to city of Springfield Springfield receives Purple Heart recognition for 10th year WWLP-22News, an NBC affiliate, began broadcasting in March 1953 to provide local news, network, syndicated, and local programming to western Massachusetts.
