  "text": "On November 29–30, BIRN Kosovo trained 29 journalists and freelancers in Prishtina on ways to enhance their ability to investigate and report on money laundering.\nThe event, organised by BIRN Kosovo and supported by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, FCDO, aimed to equip journalists with the skills they need to shed light on financial crimes, a critical area often shrouded in complexity.\nThe training included a diverse lineup of experts, including financial forensics specialists, intelligence officers and prosecutors. The workshop underscored the role of journalism in promoting accountability and transparency, by uncovering financial misconduct.\nDay one began with an introduction to the Joint Intelligence Network Against Money Laundering, delivered by Besnik Veseli, from the Tax Administration of Kosovo.\nThis session set the stage for a detailed examination of money laundering schemes, real-life cases in Kosovo and successful investigative methods drawn from the UK.\nAlan Barr and Nick Wilcox, key figures in the UK-Kosovo Anti-Money Laundering Programme, provided insights into the challenges of combating financial crime in the Balkans.\nA highlight was a practical exercise led by Visar Prebreza, a financial forensics expert, in which participants worked in groups to apply investigative techniques to hypothetical scenarios.\nThe day concluded with a working dinner at which Kosovo’s Deputy Chief Prosecutor, Ersan Qavolli, discussed the challenges of tackling money laundering cases.\nThe second day delved into practical aspects of journalism, with sessions on tracing money laundering through tax and company records and company.\nJournalists explored ways to identify high-risk sectors and typologies, analyze case studies and leverage their right to access information under Kosovo’s laws.\nIn a collaborative exercise, participants explored a fictional case of a company suspected of money laundering. Guided by the experts, they developed strategies to track money flows, draft investigative plans, and identify red flags.\nKreshnik Gashi, editor-in-chief of KALLXO.com , guided participants through the complexities of reporting on money laundering. He led sessions on understanding the right to access information crucial for uncovering financial crimes and on ways journalists can use investigative tools to expose illicit financial activities.\nGashi also explored the consequences of failing to investigate money laundering, shedding light on how unchecked financial crimes can fuel corruption and organised crime.\nHe emphasized the importance of collaboration between journalists and institutions, highlighting how investigative reporting can hold authorities accountable and empower citizens to demand transparency.\nThe workshop stressed the importance of journalism in combating financial crime. By providing journalists with the tools to investigate complex cases, it will help to foster a more informed and vigilant media landscape in Kosovo. As financial crime evolves, such initiatives will be key to ensuring transparency and upholding the rule of law.",
