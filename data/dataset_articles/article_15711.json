The young artists also tapped into their imaginations to sketch whimsical snowmen, which will soon take center stage against these vibrant backdrops. The process has been a delightful blend of exploration and creativity, and the class eagerly looks forward to the next step. In the coming week, students will peel away the tissue paper to reveal the beautiful watercolor effects beneath, bringing an added layer of texture and vibrancy to their mixed-media masterpieces. This hands-on project is sparking joy and artistic expression, creating an atmosphere of anticipation and wonder in the art studio!\nAssumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary School, 2660 E. Orange Grove Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 793-2089 or visit [school.abvmpasadena.org](http://school.abvmpasadena.org/).",
