In keeping with this tradition, SPAS students united for their 2nd Annual Christian Service Day, an event dedicated to giving back to the community. With a deep commitment to living out the values of faith, compassion, and charity, students of all grade levels worked together on various service projects, contributing their time and talents to make a positive impact on those in need. This annual event not only strengthens the students’ sense of community, but also inspires them to continue serving others throughout the year.\nSt. Philip the Apostle School, 1363 Cordova St., Pasadena, (626) 795-9691 or visit [https://school.stphiliptheapostle.org/](https://school.stphiliptheapostle.org/).",
