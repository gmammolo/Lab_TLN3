  "text": "Louisa cafeteria manager publishes children’s book to teach nutrition\nLOUISA COUNTY, Va. (WVIR) - A cafeteria manager at Thomas Jefferson Elementary School in Louisa County is now also a published author.\nDana Cahill says she and her fellow cafeteria workers spent each lunch period reminding kids to select at least one fruit or vegetable. Now, with “Hey - Don’t Forget Your Fruit,” she’s not just telling them—she’s showing them.\n“I think with everything that we do every day, we just want to make sure that kids have healthy lunches,” Cahill said.\nThough she’s never written a book before, Cahill says her experience working with kids each day made the process easy.\n“I just sat down and started writing,” Cahill said.\nThe book is a Louisa spin on a tale as old as time: getting kids to eat their greens.\n“The book has Mrs. Green who is a fun lunch lady, who does crazy games and relays for students to get excited about fruit,” Cahill said.\nCahill says the book is in honor of the cafeteria workers who work tirelessly to keep things running each day.\n“They go through great extremes to make sure these kids are fed,” Cahill said.\nThe cafeteria manager got her first copy in November, and soon, this book will decorate each lunchroom in Louisa.\n“It was surreal,” Cahill said about receiving the finished product. “I was excited and nervous.”\nDo you have a story idea?
