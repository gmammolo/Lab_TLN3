  "text": "The University of Virginia’s College at Wise (UVA Wise) and Virginia Humanities recently announced a new regional humanities center in Southwest Virginia that will be hosted by the College.\nThe center will be called “Virginia Humanities at UVA Wise,” and this new partnership will amplify stories from across Southwest Virginia and illustrate the ways the humanities bring communities together to foster dialogue and understanding.\nThroughout the last five decades, Virginia Humanities has supported efforts to document, preserve and amplify Virginia’s history, heritage and cultural traditions.\n“When I was first approached about hosting the Virginia Humanities Hub at UVA Wise, I thought it was a great idea. It would give us an opportunity to expand the humanities here at UVA Wise and give our students the opportunity to touch every discipline along their education. We are excited to work alongside of and partner with Virginia Humanities to make this happen for our students,” says Donna P. Henry, UVA Wise’s Chancellor.\n“We are thrilled about our new partnership with Virginia Humanities,” said Jinny Turman, who serves as co-director of the College’s Center for Appalachian Studies (CAS) and associate professor of history at UVA Wise. “This collaboration will enable us to expand our work and reach even further into communities in Southwest Virginia in ways that preserve and protect the unique culture in the region.”\nUVA Wise has been a member of the prestigious Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges since 2013. Wise's Center for Appalachian Studies (CAS) was founded in 2013 for the study of the region’s history, culture, economy, environment and health, with an eye toward protection, preservation and progress.\nVirginia Humanities at UVA Wise is the second of several new regional humanities centers being launched. It follows a center that opened in Norfolk at WHRO Public Media in July. Each center will be headquartered within an existing regional organization, in either a cultural nonprofit, two-year or four-year college. Virginia Humanities will provide expertise and funds for regranting to other local nonprofit organizations. In turn, each center will be able to support humanities programs and conversations about local topics their residents care about most.\nIt was recently announced that the Anne and Gene Worrell Foundation has made a five-year commitment totaling $640,000 to support the new regional humanities center that opened Monday at the College at Wise.\n“Early on in our foundation work, we began working in Southwest Virginia to continue the legacy of Anne and Gene Worrell, who loved this area and the humanities. The foundation wanted to help Southwest Virginia and loved the idea of the Hub being here and becoming partners with Virginia Humanities to make it happen. The Worrells loved Appalachian traditions, music, poetry, and art. They believed in the power of storytelling and we’re grateful that this work continues and is made accessible to this part of the region,” says Holly Hatcher, President and CEO of the Anne and Gene Worrell Foundation.",
