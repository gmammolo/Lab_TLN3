  "text": "For the Cultural Connoisseur: An Opportunity to Be Entertained\nEvery year brings a new slate of entertaining and thought-provoking events to the [SHU Community Theatre](https://www.shucommunitytheatre.org/) in downtown Fairfield. Film screenings, discussions and live performances featuring some of the biggest names in entertainment inspire and educate SHU audiences and area visitors throughout the year. Why not consider [purchasing a gift card](https://www.shucommunitytheatre.org/gift-certificates) or learning about a [gift membership](https://www.shucommunitytheatre.org/become-a-member)? Or pick up the tab on an upcoming theatrical, musical or dance performance at the [John & Sabina Petillo Center for the Performing Arts](//www.sacredheart.edu/sacred-heart-life/student-events--activities/performing-arts-program/john-and-sabina-petillo-center-for-the-performing-arts/) or the [Edgerton Center for the Performing Arts](https://edgertoncenter.org/), such as [A Christmas Carol](https://edgertoncenter.org/events/a-christmas-carol-2/)—an adaptation written by nationally recognized alumni playwright Grace Caroline Curley, ‘23, and starring SHU alum John Ratzenberger as Scrooge. You could also consider [a gift subscription](https://edgertoncenter.org/ticket-information/be-a-subscriber/). Along those lines, why not gift a “trip” to space through Sacred Heart University’s [Discovery Science Center & Planetarium](https://www.shudiscovery.org/)?",
