Every day, I am thankful to work at this great institution and to represent Michigan Athletics. I especially want to thank the student-athletes, coaches and staff who compete for each of our teams and who have helped us achieve unparalleled success athletically and academically. I am excited to continue giving back to a university that has provided me with so much over my career.\"\nU of M has won 52 Big Ten championships since 2020 under Manuel's leadership, including Michigan football taking home the 2023 National Championship.\nWarde was named athletic director in 2016 after serving as athletic director at the University of Connecticut, according to his staff bio.\nHe earned a bachelor's degree from U of M, as well as his master's degree and a Master of Business Administration at the university's Stephen M.
