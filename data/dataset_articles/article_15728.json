  "text": "Alabama’s staff is buzzing over its latest talent haul. The Crimson Tide signed 21 players on Wednesday and currently holds the No. 4 recruiting class in the nation.\nAlabama’s class is headlined by five-star talents Keelon Russell (No. 3 overall, No. 1 pro-style QB), Michael Carrol (No. 14 overall, No. 3 OT) and Dijon Lee Jr. (No. 25 overall, No. 3 CB). The Tide also signed 14 four-star recruits and a trio of three-stars.\n“I think a lot of these guys can play early,” head coach Kalen DeBoer said during Alabama’s ‘Rising Tide’ signing day show. “That's really what the expectation is, I know on their end too. We did that with a lot of guys even this last year, played a lot of freshmen. So that's exciting.”\nThroughout Wednesday’s Early Signing Day Deboer, general manager Courtney Morgan and player personnel director Bob Welton spoke on a dozen incoming players. Here’s what was said about the Tide’s signees.\nAlabama’s class is headlined by five-star talents Keelon Russell (No. 3 overall, No. 1 pro-style QB), Michael Carrol (No. 14 overall, No. 3 OT) and Dijon Lee Jr. (No. 25 overall, No. 3 CB).
