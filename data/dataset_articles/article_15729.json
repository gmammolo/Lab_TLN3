  "text": "Junior forward Sarengbe Sanogo first came to the United States with a dream to play alongside her sister Mariam Sanogo. Traveling from France, the two secured spots at Northwest Kansas Technical College before transferring to Odessa College.\nHowever, when Sarengbe Sanogo was offered a scholarship to join the Lady Raiders’ basketball program, the dream of playing together split.\nFaced with the decision to leave behind her biggest influence, Sarengbe Sanogo said she hesitated. However, Mariam Sanogo urged her to go. Sarengbe Sanogo said her sister reminded her that the chance to play at the Division One level was too good an opportunity for either of them to pass up.\nDespite receiving offers from other programs, Sarengbe Sanogo ultimately committed to becoming a Lady Raider.\n“Texas Tech was the biggest school,” Sarengbe Sanogo said. “I felt like coming to Tech was an extension of what I was doing in Odessa (College). I’m doing the same thing but at a superior level. I’m doing it better.”\nSarengbe Sanogo has since become a key player for the Lady Raiders; however, the thought of playing for Tech might never have crossed her mind if not for her sister.\nDuring the 2023-24 Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship, Mariam Sanogo said she lay in bed scrolling through game highlights on her iPad when the Lady Raiders caught her attention.\n“When I started watching, team by team, Texas Tech stood out,” Mariam Sanogo said. “The way they played hard really reminded me of Odessa. They had tall players, but some weren’t playing much. I thought, ‘Sarengbe’s tall, athletic and can run — this could be a great fit for her.’”\nDuring their time together at Odessa College, Mariam Sanogo introduced Sarengbe Sanogo to highlights of Tech women’s basketball, planting the seed for what was to come. Meanwhile, Sarengbe Sanogo made a name for herself on the court.\nIn her sophomore season, she averaged 11.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game, starting 29 of 32 contests and helping lead Odessa to a 30-5 record and an NJCAA Elite 8 appearance.\nMariam Sanogo and Sarengbe Sanogo shared a bond not just as siblings but also as teammates. It was a relationship rooted in trust and built on mutual ambition. While Mariam guided her sister off the court, Sarengbe made strides on it.\nSince donning the scarlet and black, she has made a strong impression on the coaching staff, earning the starting forward spot in the first game of the 2024-25 season — a role she has maintained through Tech’s first nine games.\nTo illustrate her performance in the starting role, Sarengbe Sanogo made her mark as Tech’s top defender within the paint. She has recorded 19 blocks throughout nine games and ranks No. 18 in the country in total blocks, according to NCAA stats.\nSarengbe Sanogo’s decision to commit to Tech wasn’t solely about basketball. It was also about trusting the environment her sister had introduced her to. Mariam Sanogo’s influence, built on years of playing and learning together, made the transition easier, even if it meant stepping out on her own.\nFor Mariam Sanogo, the connection she saw between Tech’s playing style and Sarengbe Sanogo’s strengths was clear. Watching highlights and games on her tablet, she envisioned how her sister’s talents could make an impact at the Division One level.\n“Tech plays at a similar pace as Odessa,” Mariam Sanogo said. When Tech plays, they look like they’re out there playing for each other. I felt like I wanted to play for them myself, and that’s how I knew Sarengbe Sanogo could perform for them.”\nEven as Sarengbe Sanogo moved on, Mariam Sanogo remained a constant source of encouragement. After nearly every game, she offers feedback, focusing on areas of improvement while reminding her sister of her progress.\n“I watch all of her games,” Mariam Sanogo said. I don’t have ESPN +, but I ask my teammates and coaches for their phones to watch her play. I’m always telling her what she can do better.”\nTech head coach Krista Gerlich said Sarengbe Sanogo is buying into what the team wants in terms of development.\n“She’s getting more confident in what we’re doing,” Gerlich said. “I love her aggressiveness, determination and hard work … . We haven’t had a rim protector like her since I’ve been here.”\nWith her sister’s continued influence to advance her basketball career, Sarengbe Sanogo said she remains focused on being the presence in the paint that Tech needs.\n“She’s doing an amazing job, and I hope she continues to grow because she truly deserves it,” Mariam Sanogo said. “I’m excited to see what she’ll accomplish this year.”",
