  "text": "Stony Brook University Interim President [Richard McCormick](https://www.stonybrook.edu/pres/) recently sat down with two members of the [Undergraduate Student Government ](https://stonybrookusg.com/)(USG) to discuss his vision for the university, the importance of student engagement, and his initiatives during his time as interim president.\nMcCormick spoke with Sarah Alberouti, USG vice president of university affairs, and Lamia Rothi, USG vice president of communications in the “Fireside Chat.”\n“I wake up every morning happy to go to work,” McCormick shared. “This is the most enjoyable position I’ve ever held.”\nMcCormick is a scholar of U.S. political history and brings decades of academic and administrative experience to Stony Brook. He reflected on his career, which includes leadership roles at Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Washington.\nHe noted the unique characteristics of Stony Brook’s students. “Half come from economically disadvantaged families, and about 40 percent qualify for federal Pell Grants,” he said. “What’s extraordinary is that Pell recipients graduate at slightly higher rates than their peers. That’s something I’ve never seen at another university.”\nHe also highlighted the university’s growing popularity. “Applications for next year’s first-year class are up 35 percent from this year and nearly 100 percent from 2022. This school is hot!”\nWhen asked about increasing undergraduate research opportunities, McCormick emphasized the importance of students taking initiative. “Go to your department chair or professor and ask about research opportunities,” he advised. “Research teaches you how to create knowledge, work in teams, and apply what you’ve learned. These are invaluable skills for life.”\nHe acknowledged the perception that STEM dominates research at Stony Brook but noted that the humanities, social sciences, and arts are equally vital. “You can’t have a great university without excellence in these areas,” he said, encouraging students to explore programs like [Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/) (URECA).\nMcCormick shared details about the Stony Brook Future Scholars Program, a mentorship initiative targeting rising eighth graders in underserved communities. “We promise to guide them through high school, ensuring they’re college-ready,” he said. “This program transforms families, not just individuals, and by doing so, it transforms communities.”\nHe also highlighted efforts to increase collaboration between the East Campus health sciences and the West Campus departments, as well as his commitment to securing funding for improved facilities.\nFrom attending student events like [Light the Brook](https://news.stonybrook.edu/university/light-the-brook-ignites-holiday-spirit-and-stony-brook-pride/) to hosting monthly student dinners, McCormick prioritizes direct communication with students. “These conversations are invaluable,” he said. “Students share honest feedback, and I bring their concerns back to my team to address them.”\nAs interim president, McCormick is focused on continuing Stony Brook’s momentum and fostering its supportive culture. “While I’m here, I’m not just an interim president — I’m the president,” he stated. “I want to connect with the campus community and celebrate what makes Stony Brook special.”\n“This conversation was incredibly informative,” Alberouti said. “It’s clear you’re passionate about advancing Stony Brook’s mission and connecting with its students.”",
