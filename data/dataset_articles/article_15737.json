  "text": "Mandeville running back Nate Sheppard made it official. After his season ended abruptly with a Week 8 leg injury, the senior turned the page and signed his letter of intent to play at Duke during a five-person signing ceremony at Mandeville on Dec. 5. “Today means a lot to me,” Sheppard said. “I’ve been ready to get up to Duke really since the injury. I love being around my teammates, but once I got injured, I was just thinking about how could I get back on the field and play.” The 5-foot-10, 190-pound athlete is still wheeling around on his scooter after successful surgery weeks ago, but that didn’t dampen the mood Thursday. Sheppard, who committed to the Blue Devils in August, said he never waived from Duke. “Being a new coaching staff, this was their first full recruiting class of high school players, so being part of that experience and being a part of this high school class that will be the foundation of the new Duke program is pretty special,” he said. The final numbers for his senior season were impressive — 1,888 yards from scrimmage with a 269.7 yards per game average. He finished with 26 offensive touchdowns and 31 total trips to the end zone. Mandeville coach Craig Jones said those numbers only tell part of the story. “I think he is going to be an instant contributor on special teams, and he’ll fight for playing time in the backfield. He’s a competitor, and he wants to win. He brought in what we were doing offensively really fast. I expect he’ll do the same at Duke,” Jones said. “His football IQ is much higher than what you get with your average high school football player. He’s going to be able to step in at the college level right away. They are much more detailed, with more options for anything that they do. He’ll be able to jump in and contribute right away. He’s going to know all of his assignments.” Sheppard, who plans to enroll in January, said he’s ready for the next chapter. “Getting that extra experience around the staff, around the coaches and getting the playbook six months earlier than everybody else is definitely an advantage,” Sheppard said. “It was really important to me to get up there early. I’ve been wanting to be a mid-year enrollee for the last year. I just want to get familiar with the program as soon as possible.” Sheppard shared the stage with four of his classmates. Max Jacketti will run track and cross country at Division II Mississippi College in Clinton, Miss. The four-year letterman in track and cross country, who set several school records, said the Choctaws will give him a chance to compete at a high level. “Coach (Chris) Weber really made it feel like home,” Jacketti said. “I also want to compete at the national level for D-II. They just got back from nationals and had a good performance. I feel like it’s a really good place for me to excel and get to the times that I want to get to.” Evan Hasenkampf will swim at Division III College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio. Hasenkampf started swimming at age 5 and was a four-year swimmer for the Skippers. At Wooster, Hasenkampf said he’ll swim the 500-yard, 1000-yard and mile strokes as his main distances. “They had everything that I was looking for,” Hasenkampf said. “The academics at the school are great. When I visited, it felt like home. They were really interested in me, and that kind of put them over the edge.” A pair of baseball players also signed as outfielder Tyler Fischer is headed to Delgado while Logan McNamara will play at Division III Belhaven in Jackson, Miss. Fischer, who hit .330 last season and led the team in RBIs and doubles, said staying close to home was important. “It just felt like a good fit for me,” Fischer said. “It’s close to home. I felt like it was important to stay close to my family and still get to play college baseball. McNamara said the Blazers felt like a perfect fit to continue his pitching career. “Once I went on my visit, it just felt like home,” McNamara said. “The coaches treated me well. The coaches knew what they were talking about, and I feel like the program can help me grow as a person. I feel like I’ll have really good success there.”",
