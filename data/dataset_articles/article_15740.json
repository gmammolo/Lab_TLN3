  "text": "With the classroom lights dimmed, a colorful disco ball on and upbeat \"Mario Kart\"-themed music playing over the speakers, the computer science classroom at Adams Elementary School felt like a real arcade Thursday morning.\nThe fourth grade students were spread throughout the room, each laughing and hollering as they attempted to win the video games featuring characters and challenges created and coded by their peers using an online software.\nOne game tasked players with completing an obstacle course to collect diamonds and reach the bowl of popcorn at the end. Another involved snails gobbling up slices of pizza while avoiding flying balls of fire.\n“They're really excited. They're helping each other. They're working together,” said Mary Abebe, the computer science teacher at Adams.\nBefore beginning to build their video games, students rolled a die to decipher which characters they would use and what the game mechanics would involve, whether that be to have characters collect, chase, jump or avoid items.\nPeople are also reading… Lincoln native purchases Michael Jordan's iconic Chicago mansion for $9.5 million Here's a list of Lincoln restaurants open on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day Nebraska Gov.

Using this software, they could decide how their characters would move, what each button on the screen would do and how the game could be won, Abebe said.\nSome games followed owls and candy, while others had rainbows, cats and broccoli florets.\n“They can bring their own creativity to the game, and that's what I love,” she said.",
