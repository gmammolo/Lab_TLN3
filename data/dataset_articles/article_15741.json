  "text": "Vail Mountain and Beaver Creek Resort will re-announce their $450,000 EpicPromise grant to the Vail Valley Foundation during Friday’s Birds of Prey World Cup downhill. The check presentation will take place following the national anthem at 10:30 a.m. at the Red Tail Stadium in Beaver Creek.\nOriginally presented last year, the funding is designated to help address the critical child care shortage in the Eagle River Valley as the Vail Valley Foundation works to expand early childhood education opportunities. The foundation recently signed a pre-construction agreement with RA Nelson, a respected local construction company, to build a new child care facility in Avon , and is currently reviewing proposals for a facility operator.\nOnce completed, the 13,450-square-foot early childhood education and development center will provide approximately 165 spots for children ages 0-5 . The project is expected to break ground by May 2025, with the facility becoming operational by fall 2026. Some of the $450,000 grant also supports afterschool and summer programs for Eagle County youth through YouthPower365, another Vail Valley Foundation program.\nLearn more about EpicPromise at EpicPromise.com , learn more about the Vail Valley Foundation at VVF.org and learn more about YouthPower365 at YouthPower365.org .",
