  "text": "By Damon Matthew Yung/KSU/Special ,\n4 hours ago Diya Patel is earning her undergraduate degree from KSU at age 19, graduating with honors with a bachelor's degree in psychology. Matthew Yung/KSU/Special Diya Patel knows she has a long road ahead to achieve her dream of becoming a physician, so she decided to sprint through the work needed to earn her undergraduate degree at Kennesaw State University.\nAt 19, she will graduate with honors on Dec. 10 with a bachelor's degree in psychology.\n\"I took the maximum load of classes every semester, and I took classes during the summer,\" she said. \"I felt that I was capable enough, and I wanted to graduate early because the medical school journey is so long.\"\nWhile she emphasized a quick completion of her undergraduate career, Patel also made time to be a very involved member of the KSU community. She is enrolled in the KSU Journey Honors College, where she has served as president of the Honors Advisory Leadership Council.\nShe has created and co-created several student service, support and academic interest organizations during her time as an Owl, including the KSU chapter of It's On Us, an organization focused on combating sexual assault.\nThroughout her studies she has also been involved in several undergraduate research projects with KSU faculty.\nOutside the classroom, most of Patel's interests involve learning - about history, culture and languages, and geopolitics. She has volunteered for social service organizations assisting refugee populations as well as people who are unhoused.\nAfter beginning her career as a medical doctor, Patel intends to remain actively engaged in volunteer work globally on issues she is passionate about, including education, health care and sustainable development.\nA polyglot and proud native of India, she spent much of her childhood in Tanzania before her family immigrated to the United States, where she graduated from North Gwinnett High School in Suwanee. She works in an urgent care facility that has many Spanish-speaking patients and plans to continue working there while applying to medical school.\nAs crossing the stage at the Convocation Center to receive her degree approaches, Patel said she found an enriching, caring community at KSU.\n\"I was attracted to KSU's diversity and its affordability, at the beginning,\" she said. \"The longer I stayed, the more I realized it was the right place for me.\"\nPatel has made a lasting impression on assistant professor of psychology Danica Kulibert.\n\"Diya is a clear example of what it means to be a KSU student. She is hard working, determined and passionate about making this world a better place for people of all backgrounds and identities,\" Kulibert said. \"I truly believe she is going to do amazing things and I am honored that she was able to start her journey at KSU and in my research lab.\"\nFor more information, visit kennesaw.edu .",
