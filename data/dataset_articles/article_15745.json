  "text": "Organised by the Institution of Engineers Malaysia and its Geotechnical Engineering Technical Division, the competition brought together top civil engineering students from across the nation to address intricate real-world engineering challenges.\nKUCHING (Dec 6): A team of third and fourth year civil engineering undergraduates from Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak secured the first runner-up position at the national-level IEM-ICP Pile Prediction Competition.\nAs the sole team from East Malaysia, members Stephanie Ha Sze Ting, Mandy Lam Xing Ying, Hii Wang Cheong, and Marc Harting Ajin demonstrated exceptional skills, determination and innovative problem-solving abilities, said the university in a release.\nOrganised by the Institution of Engineers Malaysia and its Geotechnical Engineering Technical Division, the competition brought together top civil engineering students from across the nation to address intricate real-world engineering challenges.\n“It tested the participants’ ability to estimate pile capacity using real-world data, including a Static Load Test Report and Soil Investigation Report.\n“A challenge that revolved around analysing a 500mm diameter spun pile with a penetration depth of 25.5 meters required high levels of technical proficiency and analytical precision,” said Swinburne Sarawak.\nThe team, under the guidance of academic advisor Dr Choo Chung Siung – also the university’s Centre for Innovative Society director – and industrial advisor Chen Chuang Loom, presented their findings to a panel of esteemed judges during the competition’s final stage.\nChoo in the release said this achievement exemplified Swinburne’s commitment to nurturing globally competitive graduates capable of excelling in real-world engineering contexts.\n“Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world challenges, ensuring our students are prepared to be both job takers and job creators in the dynamic engineering field,” he said.\nHe added this accomplishment follows Swinburne Sarawak’s victory in the inaugural edition of the competition last year, further solidifying the university’s reputation as a leader in civil engineering education.\n“This competition is just the beginning. This milestone strengthens our drive to be a prototype of global best practice, championing innovation and collaboration across disciplines and industries.\n“We aim to enhance career readiness through work-integrated learning, ensuring our graduates are well-equipped for the evolving demands of the industry.”\nSwinburne is an Australian university based in Melbourne, Australia. The Sarawak Campus in Kuching is the only international, full-fledged branch campus of the university.\nSwinburne is ranked among the top one per cent of universities globally in the QS World University Rankings 2024 and the latest Academic Ranking of World Universities, and Swinburne Sarawak has been recognised as one of the country’s Top 10 Preferred Private Universities by JobStreet.com.\nFor more information on Swinburne Sarawak, go to website www.swinburne.edu.my , Facebook page @swinburnesarawak, Instagram page @swinburnesarawak, X page @Swinburne_Swk, TikTok page @swinburnesarawak or YouTube channel Swinburne Sarawak.",
