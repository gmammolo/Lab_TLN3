  "text": "Travel My favorite courses of 2024? They reminded me what’s important By: Josh Berhow Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram December 5, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email An aerial view of Sedge Valley at Sand Valley Golf Resort in Wisconsin. Brandon Carter/Sand Valley We’ve often used this space this time of year to wax poetic — or at least attempt to — about our favorite courses we played over the last 12 months. There are two reasons for that. One, this is a golf website, and it’s something we can write about to feed the machine. And two, we like to think it’s a good resource for our readers. Maybe it’s a course they’ve played too, but ideally it’s one they haven’t, which can then educate and motivate them to add it to their to-do list. It’s a wonderful thing — opening peoples’ eyes to great golf courses they might not have heard of.But here’s a slight twist to my entry. I already wrote about those courses. So instead of writing about my favorite spots I played for the first time in 2024 — Chaska Town Course in Chaska, Minn., and Sedge Valley at Sand Valley Golf Resort in Wisconsin — I’m going to tell you instead what I learned on golf courses in 2024.I’m sure I’ve written before that I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to get my handicap as low as possible, and it hasn’t been easy. I’m a 14, was once down to a 13, have long thought I could be at least an 11 but also never practice and don’t play consistently. The handshake par-4 1st hole at Chaska Town Course. Josh Berhow This handicap-lowering quest only led to stressful rounds, as bad days on the course became incredibly frustrating and good days turned into white-knuckle rides, hanging on to get them into the clubhouse before the inevitable crash.But some time over the summer, this all changed. I’m not sure there was an exact moment, but at some point I started caring less but enjoying more. Part of that was due specifically to my new strategy in terms of which courses I played (like the ones mentioned above), which helped rejuvenate something that needed rejuvenating: having fun while playing golf.I learned more expensive doesn’t always mean more enjoyable. Or that prettier doesn’t always mean better. I learned that golf courses are like a diner menu — there’s something for everyone, and not everyone will agree on what’s best. In short, my criteria for which courses I chose to play became simple: less on the punishing aspect of golf, more on the memorable. Places where I can’t wait to go back to, not ones in which I’m afraid of the danger at every turn. Maybe that’s the key for Average Joe golfers like me. Playability. What a wonderful word.
