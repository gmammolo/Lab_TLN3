  "text": "Istituto Marangoni Miami (IMM) and renowned Italian designer Sara Battaglia debuted the iconic “Red Collar” shirt capsule during Miami Art Week, a project designed to raise awareness about gender-based violence. The exclusive event took place on December 2, 2024, at IMM, gathering luminaries from fashion, music, film, and entertainment to celebrate this powerful initiative.\nPhoto Credit: Courtesy\nHosted by Hakan Baykam, IMM President and CEO, and Sara Battaglia, the evening marked a celebration of creativity and social impact. Notable guests included Eva Hughes, IMM Executive Vice President; Elizabeth Sulcer, celebrity stylist; Carmen Busquets, entrepreneur; model Clementine Desseaux; and Angeles Almuna, founder of Fashion Strikes Cancer. The event also featured DJ ilMuretto, who set the tone for the vibrant evening.\nThe centerpiece of the night was the auction of a reimagined “Red Collar” shirt designed by Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, Creative Director of Swarovski and Sara Battaglia’s sister. Embellished with 3,000 red Swarovski crystals, the shirt fetched the highest bid of $500. The proceeds from the auction, along with additional contributions, will support IMM’s scholarship fund, helping underprivileged and talented students pursue careers in fashion and design.\nThe “Red Collar” project, spearheaded by Sara Battaglia, uses fashion as a medium to amplify women’s voices and promote awareness of gender violence. The vibrant red hue of the shirts symbolizes resilience and strength, serving as a global emblem against abuse.\nHakam Baykam and Sara Battaglia Photo Credit: Courtesy\n“The Red Collar project is an emblem of education, solidarity, and rebirth. By collaborating with IMM, we’re empowering the next generation of designers to use fashion as a platform for meaningful change, while supporting women who are on their own journey of renewal,” notes Sara Battaglia. “The Red Collar project is a testament to the transformative power of creativity and craftsmanship. This special edition red collar shirt, adorned with Swarovski crystals, is more than a statement piece—it’s a symbol of resilience, strength, and hope,” adds Giovanna Battaglia Engelbert, highlighting the artistry and purpose of the project.\nIn collaboration with IMM students and prominent figures such as Rossy de Palma, Lola Schnabel, and Elizabeth Sulcer, the capsule showcased unique reinterpretations of the “Red Collar” shirt. Each design, crafted with care by Dritto Filo—an anti-violence organization supporting survivors—represents a powerful message of empowerment and renewal.\nSara Battaglia X IMM Red Collar Photo Credit: Courtesy\nIMM’s involvement in the “Red Collar” project underscores its commitment to using fashion as a tool for meaningful change. Twenty talented IMM students participated in the initiative, offering fresh perspectives on the symbolic garment. These designs will remain on display at IMM through December, allowing the public to engage with the message of resilience and solidarity.\nThe classic “Red Collar” shirts are available for purchase exclusively at The Webster Miami until December 31, 2024. This initiative stands as a beacon of hope, combining fashion, education, and social advocacy to make a lasting impact.",
