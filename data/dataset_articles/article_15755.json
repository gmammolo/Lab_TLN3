I am also interviewing staff at the Jewish Education Center of Cleveland, which is responsible for developing educational materials that are distributed to various Hebrew schools in Cleveland.

Along with completing their project, Summer Scholars live together and engage in enrichment activities and field trips around Northeast Ohio to learn more about the landscape of research and creative work that fuels our local economy and culture.
