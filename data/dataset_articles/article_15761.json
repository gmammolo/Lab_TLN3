  "text": "On December 7, visitors to the W. M. Keck Earth Science and Mineral Engineering Museum have the opportunity to visit the museum with an expert in Nevada’s history eager to share his extensive knowledge. Museum curator Garrett Barmore opens the museum on the first Saturday of each month so that those who are unable to visit the museum during the week can still enjoy the wonders the museum has to offer.\nThe museum includes three collection areas. One is the paleontology collection, which includes fossils from around the world and many from Nevada, including several parts of a mastodon fossil from Nevada and old mining equipment used in Nevada’s silver mines and gemstones.\nAnother highlight of the museum is the Mackay Silver Collection, which features over 50 of the 1250-piece set of silver largely made from mines in the Comstock lode and produced by Tiffany and Company.\n“I may be biased, but the Mackay Silver Collection alone is well worth a visit to the museum,” Barmore said. “I look forward to sharing more about the silver set and the rest of our collection objects with anyone who visits.”\nMetered parking is available in front of Morrill Hall, at the south end of the University Quad.
