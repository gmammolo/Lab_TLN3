  "text": "By Matthew Baughman Leader-Telegram staff ,\n2 hours ago\nEAU CLAIRE — A group of fourth grade students stood in front of Mr. Modjeski’s class at Putnam Heights Elementary School on Thursday while pointing to a slide featuring a banana and a sandwich wrapper. When they pointed to the banana, everyone in the class shouted “yes,” as they were taught what is and is not compostable.\n“Composting is a natural way to reuse food and a way to break it down into dirt without making any pollution, which is a way to make a better environment and a way to stop pollution from happening,” Everett Stovern, a fourth grader at Putnam Heights, said at the beginning of the presentation.\nContinuing, fourth grade peer Andrew Tyler said, “What can we compost? We can compost fruit, vegetables, meat, bread and pretty much anything as long as it is food.”\n“We can not compost plastic wrappers, milk cartons, plastic sporks, plastic forks and spoons. You cannot compost anything plastic,” added fellow peer Bright Star Reyes Xalamihua.\nAs groups of fourth graders headed from class to class, the school prepared its students to begin composting in their cafeteria starting next Monday. It would be a new venture for the school, as the Eau Claire Area School District continues to boost their composting efforts and sustainability practices at school.\nThe initiative to teach students was led by Charles Mabie, a fourth grade teacher at Putnam Heights who helps run the school’s garden as well, who said the idea began when their assistant principal, Timothy Mulrain, approached him with the idea to let kids lead the education.\nMabie said, “We met, and then he told me that he wanted to have students lead the teaching of this, and I said that sounds awesome. We met with people from the district and the county, and talked about what that could look like at Putnam, and what it is going to look like in the lunch room.”\n“I didn’t really have a plan,” he continued. “I just opened up a blank Google doc, connected it to the screen and sat down with them and we figured out what we would need to learn, what we would need to teach and what we would need to make sure we include in our presentations.”\nThe ability to introduce this program in the school comes from USDA grant funding for reducing food waste. Food scraps collected during the week will go towards a composting program led by Earthbound Environmental Solutions.\nThe fourth grade students will help other grade levels compost for the next two weeks to help them get adjusted to the change, as Mabie said they hope to leave a big impact by putting this sustainability practice into action.\n“I think it is really important because the habits that we build now are going to be the habits that we tend to use throughout our life,” said Mabie. “Especially for the younger grade levels, having a second grade classroom look and see how excited these fourth graders are about composting and about how much it is going to help the environment to prevent this food waste from going into the landfills, I think it means more for other kids to be excited about it than for me to.”\nAnd alongside his own excitement, the students share a similar level of enthusiasm.\n“I am just so happy how we are helping the environment in doing it too,” said Stovern. “It just takes so much food waste out of the landfill and turns it into compost.”\n“It’s going to keep going on forever,” said Riley Kloss, a fourth grader, who wishes for the school to continue this practice long after they have helped to teach it.\n“I hope we’re putting a lot less in landfills; I hope that kids see how much less that is and, as they grow older and mature, understand the impact of that,” said Mabie. “Especially this group here, I hope they feel like they really made a difference. That they, as 10-year-olds, made a significant impact on the community by helping kids learn how to compost and why it is important.”",
