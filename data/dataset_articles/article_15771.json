  "text": "The Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat released the results of the Gujarat State Institutional Rating Framework (GSIRF) 2024 on Thursday. This ranking system, designed to help students choose the best universities and colleges in the state, was unfortunately delayed by six months this year, limiting its validity to the next six months.\nA total of 564 institutes participated in various categories, including 40 universities and 524 colleges. As many as 16 universities got 5+ or 5-star rating, while 34 colleges got 5 stars. Announced at a meeting of vice chancellors in Gandhinagar, the education department introduced a new “5+ star” rating as the highest possible distinction. This accolade was awarded to four universities following a rigorous evaluation process. The existing 5-star rating remains the highest rank for the other 10 categories. Education minister Rushikesh Patel announced that, in addition to the four universities receiving the 5+ star rating, a total of 44 colleges and institutes affiliated with 16 universities achieved a 5-star rating this year. Patel and his colleagues from the education department felicitated the VCs of these universities and presented them with certificates of excellence.\nUniversity rankings\nGujarat University made history by becoming the only public university to achieve a 5+ Star rating in the GSIRF, securing its position as the top-ranked institution. It shares this honour with three Centres of Excellence: Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Nirma University and CEPT University. Nine other universities were awarded 5-star ratings, including Ahmedabad University, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DAIICT) and Gujarat Technological University.\nPharmacy rankings\nThe Pharmacy category saw the highest number of institutes receiving 5-star ratings. A total of 10 colleges earned this distinction, with Nirma University’s Institute of Pharmacy taking first place.\nCollege rankings\nEight colleges achieved the top rank of 5 stars this year. PD Patel Institute of Applied Science, affiliated with CHARUSAT, leads the pack, followed by Indukaka Ipcowala Institute of Management, also affiliated with CHARUSAT. Interestingly, no college from Ahmedabad got 5-star rating.\nInnovation rankings\nDespite Gujarat’s reputation for fostering innovation and business, the Innovation category had no 5-star colleges or institutes. Only two institutions made the list: Ganpat University with a 3-star rating and Pramukh Swami Science and HD Patel Arts College with a 2-star rating.\nVarsity Leaders says\nNeerja Gupta\nVC, Gujarat University\n“Achieving the highest rating is immensely satisfying, especially given that we scored 100 out of 100 in several evaluation categories. I believe our new initiatives in line with the National Education Policy (NEP), such as introducing professors of practice, establishing research parks, supporting start-ups with active research, and attracting foreign students, have significantly boosted our score, in addition to our strong academic performance. Building on our 5-star ratings over the past three years, we have now progressed to a 5+ star rating.”\nDr S Sundar Manoharan\nDirector General, Pandit Deendayal\nEnergy University\n“This achievement is the result of concerted efforts in industry-academia partnerships, leading to two Skill India initiatives for manufacturing solar panels and semiconductors. PDEU designed these initiatives, the Government of Gujarat funded them, and industry OEM partners sustained them.”\nDr Anup K Singh,\nDirector General, Nirma University\n“Nirma University is consistently improving its academic performance and is poised to become a leading national university. In addition to the university itself, our Institute of Architecture and Planning, Institute of Technology, Institute of Law, and Institute of Pharmacy have all achieved 5-star ratings in their respective categories.”\nProf Tridip Suhrud,\nProvost, CEPT University\n“We are committed to excellence in architecture, planning, design, technology, urban management, education, and research. We are honoured to be rated as a 5+ star university and top-ranked in the architecture category in the state, alongside the top educational institutes in Gujarat. This recognition reaffirms our dedication to providing world-class education, undertaking groundbreaking research, and creating impactful solutions through our collaboration with the industry.”\nGSIRF 2024 Rankings",
