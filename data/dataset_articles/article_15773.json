That's a substantial increase from the previous $75,000 parameter.\n“The Go Blue Guarantee breaks down economic barriers and ensures that a world-class education is available to Michigan students from all backgrounds, no matter their family’s economic means,” said U-M President Santa Ono in a statement.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement New students and returning students who fall under the new income criterion are eligible. According to the program website , there is no separate application necessary to be considered for this financial aid at the Ann Arbor campus. New students at the Dearborn and Flint campuses are also eligible.\nUniversity of Michigan’s campus in Ann Arbor during dusk on Friday, Nov. 8, 2024.

The total cost to attend a four-year college — tuition, fees, room and board, etc. — increased more than 156% from 1963 to 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics .\nThis year, in-state students at the Ann Arbor campus pay about $17,700 for tuition. However, the university says 63% of in-state undergraduate students at the main campus receive grant or scholarship aid.\nExpanding the program will cost the university about $8.8 million every year, the university stated.\nReach Dave Boucher at dboucher@freepress.com and on X @Dave_Boucher1.\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: University of Michigan expands tuition-free program\nAdvertisement About Our Ads Solve the daily Crossword 14,762 people played the daily Crossword recently.
