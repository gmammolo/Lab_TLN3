  "text": "University of Wisconsin-Superior’s Melinda Yingling , who serves as the housing coordinator, has been named a recipient of the 2024 Dr. P.B. Poorman Award for Outstanding Achievement on Behalf of LGBTQ+ People.\nThe annual honor given to LGBTQ+ people or their allies who have helped to create a safer and more inclusive climate for LGBTQ+ people. The award celebrates the memory and legacy of Dr. Paula B. Poorman, a highly regarded faculty member at UW-Whitewater dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQ+ people.\n“I am truly humbled to be a recipient of the P.B. Poorman Award,” said Yingling. “The P.B. Poorman Award represents the values of empathy, equity and social justice. Winning the award inspires me to continue to support and uplift individuals in the LGBTQ+ community, especially in the current social climate.”\nYingling has been an advocate and supporter to the LGBTQ+ community both on campus and in the greater local community. She serves as the local area coordinator for Free Mom Hugs-Minnesota, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)- Lake Superior South Shore Board of Directors and has done various fundraiser and community events to bring awareness, educate and support not only LGBTQ+ populations, but also the Superior-Duluth community.\nYingling has volunteered with Free Mom Hugs for several years and was named the local area coordinator in 2024. The organization’s mission is to empower the world to celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community through visibility, education, and conversation.\nRecently, Yingling took on a fundraising/wellness challenge with the Trevor Project where she walked 45 miles and raised money for the organization. The Trevor Project’s mission is to help end suicide among LGBTQ+ young people.\n“Whenever there is a chance to help, Melinda will be the first to step up to lend a helping hand to whoever needs it,” said Chancellor Renée Wachter .\nThis year marks the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Dr. P.B. Poorman Award. The recipients of the award were honored on December 4 in Madison during a ceremony hosted by the Universities of Wisconsin. The awards ceremony and reception was held in conjunction with the Universities of Wisconsin presentation of the Outstanding Women of Color in Education Awards.\n“Honorees are helping build a better experience for our students, faculty and staff,” said Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman. “This award recognizes their achievements in creating a safer and inclusive climate at our universities.”",
