  "text": "Five Delaware public schools were just named state finalists in a national technology contest. Student teams from middle and high schools were chosen from thousands of U.S. entries, according to the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow STEM Competition, and lie among 300 fellow state finalists. They'll each land $2,500 technology package. And soon, the contest will sharpen to three national winners – and a $100,000 prize package. The 15th annual competition asked students to utilize the power of STEM to \"create innovative solutions addressing critical issues in their local communities.\" In a press release, organizers said this year's finalists highlight common concerns among young minds nationwide: the climate crisis, mental health and wellness and school safety. Delaware's finalists were: - Caesar Rodney High School in Camden - MOT Charter High School in Middletown - Millsboro Middle School in Millsboro - Newark Charter School in Newark - Charter School of Wilmington, with two teams, in Wilmington One familiar name didn't hit the list this year. Brandywine High School had gone back-to-back. Last year, students from Brandywine were named national winners in the 14th annual STEM competition – the same national title another team from the school clinched the year before. Students Olivia Erskine, Katherine McDerby, Isabella Chermak and Malti John, alongside STEM teacher Sean Merklin, led a 2023-24 project that has redesigned classic board games to accommodate players of all abilities. The team won the $100,000 prize package with Samsung products and classroom resources that year. They also scored the new Rising Entrepreneurship award, receiving an additional $25,000 prize. The school didn't participate this year, according to a district spokesperson. Now, five other schools in Delaware will try to follow that act. Schools that advance will be producing videos explaining their projects, progress and vision for Samsung Solve for Tomorrow. By April, more details and national winners will be shared. Got a story?
