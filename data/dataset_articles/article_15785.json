  "text": "Dec. 5, 2024\nThis paid piece is sponsored by Dakota State University.\nAdaptable.\nThat’s the ideal word to describe the College of Arts & Sciences at Dakota State University.\n“We used to say that an arts and sciences degree helped open doors in any career field,” said Dr. Stacey Berry, dean of the college. “Even with the rise of emerging technologies, this is still true because arts and sciences play a key role in supporting the human-machine collaboration that defines today’s AI-driven workplace.”\n“Today’s tech-augmented work environment requires a strong human element,” Berry added.\n“Employers are looking for professionals who excel in critical thinking, communication and creativity, and these are the skills that make our graduates adaptable and indispensable in the workplace.”\nThis adaptability is a hallmark of DSU’s College of Arts & Sciences, which blends interdisciplinary learning, creativity and cutting-edge technology to prepare students for the dynamic job market.\n“Our programs foster leaders and decision-makers who thrive in collaborative environments,” Berry said.\nShe took on the role as dean this fall, after 14 years teaching in the English program. Drawn to DSU because of its student-centered vision and forward-thinking integration of technology, she transitioned into administration to amplify the successes of students and faculty. “Being an advocate for others has shown me how rewarding leadership can be,” she said.\nLooking to the future, Berry is passionate about driving innovation in the curriculum and research.\n“What motivates me is finding ways that technology and collaboration can inform programs and position our graduates for success.”\nEthan Sip is one of the DSU students whose artwork was featured in a recent student exhibition at the Madison Area Arts Council.\nEvery major in the College of Arts & Sciences incorporates technology as a vital element of applied learning. For example, students studying animation and graphic design begin with hand-drawn and hand-painted projects before leveraging technology to explore other possible results. This combination of human-centered and technical skills makes them uniquely prepared for the demands of the industry.\nPrograms in math, science and English similarly align with the university’s cyber and computer science initiatives, including artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Faculty in these areas are heavily involved with teaching and researching emerging technologies, often engaging undergraduate students in groundbreaking projects. These efforts highlight the college’s commitment to innovation across all disciplines.\nDr. Bill Bendix teaches in the Cyber Leadership & Intelligence program through the College of Arts & Sciences at DSU. This major incorporates the study of technology with world cultures, international politics and leadership.\nBerry emphasizes that adaptability doesn’t just come from curriculum innovation — it’s also about staying connected to the workforce. The college offers degrees in emerging fields such as computer game design, cyber leadership and intelligence, and digital content creation. Programs like these reflect the college’s interest in employer needs and the skills that are most in demand.\n“We’re eager to collaborate with companies, organizations and professionals who can serve on our advisory boards or guide us toward developing certificates or courses tailored to workforce needs,” Berry said.\n“Our graduates are not only prepared for their first jobs but are also positioned to lead and adapt as industries evolve,” demonstrating that the College of Arts & Sciences is committed to building connections for long-term success.\nMany DSU science majors are involved in hands-on research projects, a unique opportunity for undergraduate students.\nBy staying adaptable, innovative and connected, the college is setting the standard for a new era of interdisciplinary education.",
