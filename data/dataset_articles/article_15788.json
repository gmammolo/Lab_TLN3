  "text": "Wake Forest Embraces AI’s Potential, Emphasizing Responsible Use Recognizing the transformative impact of artificial intelligence across industries, Wake Forest University is taking proactive steps to weave AI into its curriculum while prioritizing ethical considerations and responsible use.\nPreparing Students for a Changing World The Wake Forest School of Business is at the forefront of this integration effort, equipping its students with the knowledge and capabilities needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market fueled by AI. The school views this initiative as part of a larger conversation taking place across the university about AI’s role in society.\n“We see this not just as something that’s happening in the tech landscape,” said Shannon McKeen, professor of the practice and executive director of the Center for Analytics Impact at the school. “We’re taking a deliberate approach to integrating it into our curriculum to prepare graduates for the complex realities they’ll face in the workplace.\nOne key challenge the school is addressing is the rapid evolution of AI technology. “The business school has to stay current with business trends,” McKeen said. “Our stakeholders — both students and employers — are looking for ‘AI fluency.’ While what constitutes ‘AI fluency’ is still debated, it’s crucial for graduates to understand both AI’s potential and its ethical implications.”\nLeaders at the school are also mindful of the potential pitfalls associated with AI. “There’s a temptation to use AI as a shortcut, especially in demanding programs,” McKeen noted. “Instead, AI should complement human abilities and help produce better outcomes. People should use AI to stretch their capabilities, not just reduce their effort.”\nFinding a Balance: Integrating AI Responsibly The Wake Forest School of Business is committed to ensuring ethical and responsible AI integration. “We want to be at the forefront of this conversation,”\nsaid John Montana, executive director of online strategy and instructional technology innovation. “Like anything else that’s changing rapidly in the world, we think you have to commit some time to truly understanding the complexities of the technology. This includes learning, reading, and even playing with it to form informed opinions and address potential challenges.”\nBeyond preparing graduates for the upcoming technological landscape, the business school aims to leverage AI for enhancing both faculty efficiency and ADHD.\n“[Pedagogical approaches] could free up faculty time for what Wake Forest is all about – our teacher-scholar model,” McKeen said. “We see opportunities to better customize learning experiences and meet students where they are in their learning journeys,” he added.\nStory continues below advertisement\nExpanding the Conversation <p>The “AI for Good” conference, held on Nov.\n9 at the student activity center, exemplifies the university’s commitment to facilitating broader discussions about AI.\nThe event, sponsored by the Office of Information Systems, brought together students, faculty, and industry experts to explore both the current and future impact of AI.\nThe conference underscored the necessity of incorporating ethical considerations into technological advancements. Students actively participated, raising important questions about the long-term impact of AI. “Is AI going to be here to stay or is it just part of the waves?” asked Ugo Okoli, a senior majoring double majoring in computer science and communications.\nArduino Goel, who organized\nWhat ⁤specific advice does Professor McKeen give⁢ to other institutions looking‌ to ⁣incorporate AI into their own teaching? **Interviewer:** Welcome to the show. Today, we’re ‍discussing Wake Forest University’s innovative approach to integrating artificial intelligence into its curriculum. Joining us is Professor Shannon McKeen, professor of the ‍practise and executive director of the‍ Center for Analytics Impact at the Wake Forest School of Business.\nProfessor McKeen, thank you for being here.\n**Professor McKeen:**‌ Thank you for having⁤ me.\n**Interviewer:** ‍Wake Forest is recognized for ​preemptively incorporating AI ​into ‌its curriculum. Can you share some insights into the university’s ⁣motivations behind this initiative?\n**Professor McKeen:** Absolutely. We recognize that AI is⁢ rapidly transforming industries​ worldwide. Our⁢ goal is⁤ to ensure our‍ graduates are well-prepared to navigate this changing landscape. We ​see AI as more than just a technological trend; it’s a fundamental shift in ⁣how we work and interact with the world.\n**Interviewer:** You⁢ mentioned⁣ AI‌ fluency. What does that entail in the context of the Wake Forest School of Business?\n**Professor McKeen:** It’s a ‍great question, and one that’s still ⁤being debated. But essentially, we want our graduates to understand the ​potential ⁢of AI, its‌ limitations, and ⁣its ethical implications. They need to be able to⁤ critically evaluate AI-driven solutions, identify biases, and ensure ​responsible use.\n**Interviewer:** This​ leads me to​ another point you raised: the ethical considerations​ surrounding AI. ⁣How is Wake Forest addressing these concerns?\n**Professor McKeen:** We believe it’s vital to integrate ethical considerations‍ into every stage of ​AI education. We encourage critical thinking about bias in algorithms, the potential for ⁣job ⁢displacement, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI systems.\n**Interviewer:** This sounds like a thoughtful and responsible‍ approach. What ⁤advice would you give to other institutions considering incorporating AI into their curricula?\n**Professor McKeen:** I would say don’t rush into it. Take a deliberate approach, involve faculty from diverse​ disciplines, and ​most importantly, focus on the ethical implications. AI is a⁤ powerful tool, and it’s crucial to use it responsibly.\n**Interviewer:**‌ Professor ⁤McKeen, ‍thank you for⁤ sharing your valuable insights.⁤ This has been an illuminating conversation.\n**Professor McKeen:** Thank⁣ you for having me.​ I’m glad‍ we ‍could shed some light on Wake Forest’s commitment ‌to preparing‍ students for the future‌ of AI.⁢ [[1](https://sps.wfu.edu/programs/healthcare-innovation-and-the-emerging-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/)]",
