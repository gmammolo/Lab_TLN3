  "text": "UND student receives $5,000 scholarship from Sanford Health\nGRAND FORKS, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Thursday, December 5, will be a day that Ali Moses, a student at the University of North Dakota, will remember for a long time.\nShe was chosen as the recipient of a Sanford Health scholarship that are awarded to veterans, Guard/Reserve members or active-duty military service members who have demonstrated leadership and commitment in their community.\n“It means so much to me, with especially the amount of it, and to get in from Sanford as I want to work for them in the future and it’s just a big accomplishment,” said Ali Moses, UND student.\nAli is currently working towards getting her degree in [Commercial Aviation.](https://und.edu/programs/commercial-aviation-bsaero/index.html) In 2022, Ali joined the Army National Guard for North Dakota, she also has experience in putting out wildfires, and is a member of Thompson’s Fire Department.\n“I joined when I was 14 since my dad was with the fire department and so was my sister as well, so that kind of started the emergency thing, and then my dad was also in the Army and so was my Grandpa so there was also some history with the Army,” said Moses.\nThe surprise celebration was actually suppose to take place on Tuesday, December 3, but it was canceled as Moses was called to assist with a structure fire in Manvel, North Dakota. The university still wanted to show their support and gratitude towards Moses this week.\n“I am just so blessed and honored to have that, it’s such a good surprise and to have that second family. I know I refer to my fire department as my second family, so this is even like a 3rd family,” said Moses.\nCopyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.",
