  "text": "TSU receives federal grant to help study gentrification, affordable housing in Nashville\nTSU will study the “impact of displacement and relocation from gentrifying neighborhoods in the Greater Nashville Region.”\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A $1 million grant given to Tennessee State University by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development is looking to help solve the housing crisis in Nashville. Its goal is to provide solutions to mass gentrification and displacement.\nDera Dowell has lived in her North Nashville house for 53 years. Generations of her family have called it home, and she says that’s not changing any time soon, despite constant calls from developers.\n“I tell them there’s plenty of houses they have built, so buy one of them because I’m not selling,” Dowell said.\nShe’s keeping her house, but not everyone can afford to. Many in the area are forced out because of rising prices and new expensive builds.\n“Rent is too high. We need something that we can afford because we have families,” Dowell said.\nThe grant given to TSU researchers will help them to study areas including North Nashville where you can find expensive houses built this year next to homes that have been there for decades.\n“What we are trying to do is to provide evidence-based solutions that can help the communities be empowered as well as inform more sustainable and urban policy developments,” Dr. Rafael Harun said, “We are trying to map displacement due to gentrification and then trying to find out how effective government policies are, for example, the voucher program”\nHarun is one of the TSU professors leading the team of researchers.\n“We are seeing a huge price hike, housing becoming unaffordable. So if you’re making less than $50,000, most likely you will not find any feasible location or affordable location to live,” Harun said.\nHe says the goal is to have a real impact on the future of Nashville. Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office has said by 2025 the affordable housing shortage will rise to 31,000 units.\n“We evaluate that whether people have access to affordable housing units or not. If they have them, that’s great. If not, we will be generating some policy solutions that can be implemented to ensure that there are policies in place,” Harun said.\nDowell says she hopes studies like this will help create solutions so that families can keep their homes.\n“The area is great, so I can understand why people want to move in, but we just can’t afford these houses that they are building in the area,” Dowell said.\nCopyright 2024 WSMV.
