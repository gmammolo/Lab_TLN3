  "text": "Southern University, the alma mater of such jazz greats as Alvin Batiste, Branford Marsalis and Donald Harrison, has launched a new recording studio centered around a Solid State Logic Duality Pro-Station SuperAnalogue™ 48-channel mixing console. The new facility will support two new Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Digital Media Arts programs that focus on music technology and recording arts, starting in fall 2024 and fall 2025, respectively.\nRick Camp, owner of Las Vegas-based RC1 Productions & Designs, notes that the project, conceived as a stereo studio, was delayed by the pandemic. He was never in doubt about the choice of console, he says: “The Duality is the most common and widely used console in professional studios around the world.” But by the time construction began, Apple Music’s Spatial Audio platform had launched and demand for Dolby Atmos music was exploding. “So I went back to Southern University and said, ‘You'll be behind the times if I just make this a stereo studio. We really need to bump this up and make it a 7.1.4 studio.”\nTo that end, Camp designed and integrated a custom immersive production and mixing solution for the Duality Pro-Station that combines the console’s functionality with a Pro Tools system and third-party, Dante-enabled converters, speaker optimization and monitor management hardware components. Camp’s technical design for the room includes a Genelec 7.1.4 speaker system plus George Augspurger-designed and manufactured soffited main monitors. A credenza is well stocked with high-end compressor, limiter, reverb and microphone preamp options. WSDG Walters-Storyk Design Group provided the control room’s acoustic design and construction.",
