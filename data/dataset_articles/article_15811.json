  "text": "Walla Walla University’s Center for Media Ministry (CMM) has been gaining attention for its film “Color of Threads”, which explores the themes of connection, culture, and human resilience through a captivating and emotionally driven narrative.\nMaking waves in the independent film circuit, “Color of Threads” has been showcased at several festivals across North America. In October, the film won Best Short and Best Actress at the Wild West Film Festival in Vacaville, California. “Color of Threads” has also been chosen as an official selection of the Culver City Film Festival that will be happening December 9–15 in Los Angeles, California.\nMatt Webster, producer and director of studio operations for the CMM, has been actively promoting “Color of Threads” at these festivals, sharing the story behind the mission of the CMM. “One thing we’ve noticed is that the film connects to a wide range of audiences,” said Webster. “The core message stays the same, but the interpreted message is different every time.”\nAs the film continues to gain recognition, the university is now offering “Color of Threads” to be shown at schools and churches. Groups can request screenings of the film for their classrooms or events, and Webster himself is available to lead discussions on filmmaking, storytelling, and the themes of the film. There is a screening fee to cover the cost of travel.\nTo request a screening, please visit [www.colorofthreads.com](https://www.colorofthreads.com/), and to stay up to date with the CMM, go to [wallawalla.edu/cmm](https://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/areas-of-study/communication-and-languages/center-for-media-ministry).\nPosted Dec. 5, 2025",
