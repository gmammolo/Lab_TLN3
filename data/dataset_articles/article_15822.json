  "text": "Rep. Gabe Vasquez Announces Carlsbad High School Students as 2024 Congressional App Challenge Winners\nRubye Chappa, Jonethan Camarena and Raj Bhakta Recognized for Creating Flip-Side, a Secure App Supporting Victims of Domestic Violence\nWASHINGTON, D.C. – On Thursday, December 5, 2024, U.S. RepresentativeGabe Vasquez (N.M.-02) announced Rubye Chappa, Jonethan Camarena and Raj Bhakta, students from Carlsbad High School, as the winners of the 2024 Congressional App Challenge for New Mexico’s second congressional district.\n“Congratulations to Rubye, Jonethan and Raj of Carlsbad High School for their creative and thoughtful creation that addresses the critical issue of domestic violence,” said Vasquez. “Their app, Flip-Side, is a powerful example of how technology can make a real difference. I’m very proud of these talented students who are leading the next generation of New Mexico’s innovators and problem-solvers.”\nTheir app, Flip-Side, is designed to provide victims of domestic violence a secure and discreet space to plan and use local resources. Chappa, Camarena and Bhakta were inspired to create the app after learning about alarming domestic violence statistics in New Mexico.\nThe Congressional App Challenge is the most prestigious prize in student computer science. The challenge encourages middle and high school students to learn to code and inspires them to pursue careers in computer science. Each U.S. Representative recognizes a winning team, and each winning app is put on display in the U.S. Capitol Building for one year.\n###",
