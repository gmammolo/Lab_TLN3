  "text": "Semonza, Gillie, Mucciolo and Koziol Lead Ball State All-MAC Football Selections December 05, 2024 MUNCIE, Ind. – Redshirt freshman quarterback Kadin Semonza was the Mid-American Conference Freshman of the Year for the 2024 college football season, and senior Malcolm Gillie was the league's Special Teams Player of the Year as part of All-MAC football teams that were announced on Thursday. Jon Mucciolo and Tanner Koziol were other top Ball State honorees as part of All-MAC football teams named on Thursday. Semonza completed his first full college season while throwing for 2,904 yards and completing 64.4 percent of his passes. His 25 touchdown passes were the most by a Cardinals quarterback since NFL draft pick Keith Wenning threw 35 TDs in 2013. Gillie, a senior, was Ball State's only first-team selection, earning distinction as an All-MAC kickoff returner. His 25.6 yards per kickoff return were tops in the MAC and 11th nationally. Mucciolo, a grad student, was a second-team All-MAC honoree on the offensive line. He was a preseason All-MAC pick and a member of 247Sports' Transfer All-America Team last season. With Ethan Crowe and Taran Tyo, both third-team selections, Mucciolo helped guide the most experienced offensive line in the MAC. Ball State's most highly touted offensive star in 2024 was junior tight end Tanner Koziol whose 7.8 receptions per game ranked fourth in the country. Unfortunately, ahead of him in the national rankings, second, was Bowling Green tight end Harold Fannin who garnered first team All-MAC honors. A highly regarded second-teamer, Koziol broke Ball State's single-season and career receptions records by a tight end. He finished the year with 94 catches for 839 yards. His 94 catches are fourth in Cardinals history by any receiver. Through three seasons, his 163 career receptions are ninth in Ball State history. Crowe and Tyo earned third-team selections while anchoring the veteran offensive line with Mucciolo. Crowe, a senior, earned his second All-MAC selection while Tyo, a redshirt sophomore, earned his first. Another third-team selection was junior wide receiver Cam Pickett whose breakout season followed two years of injury. His 49 catches and 528 yards both were second on the team to Koziol. Ball State's only defensive selection was senior rush linebacker Brandon Berger who had five sacks and led the Cardinals with nine QB hurries. Under the leadership of new head coach Mike Uremovich, season tickets for the 2025 Ball State football season are on sale now at an exclusive presale price.
