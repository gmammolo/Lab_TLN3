  "text": "A new barber college will train the next generation of hair care professionals in downtown Hammond.\nThe Culture Barber College is now signing up students at 222 Douglas St. Owner Marvin White has been a barber in Hammond for years.\n“I realized that by teaching this skill, I can assist in many students starting their own business,\" he said.\nThe Culture Barber College offers a comprehensive training program that takes about a year to complete. It instructs on both traditional techniques and current trends.\nIt offers rolling enrollment so students can sign up anytime. It aims to train the next crop of barbers and barber shop owners, focusing on teaching entrepreneurs what they need to do to start and run their own business.\n“We were thrilled they chose Hammond and opened doors to career pathways in this type of industry. We love the contribution to Hammond, but more so opportunity to place students in their career, with training for cutting hair but also strong business sense,\" said Kim Olesker, CEO of the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce.\nPeople are also reading…\nThe Culture Barber College recently had a ribbon cutting ceremony with many officials from the Lakeshore Chamber and the city of Hammond.\n“This ribbon cutting marked not just a new beginning for us, but also a commitment to excellence in barbering education,” White said.\nFor more information, call 219-803-0030 or visit [theculturebarbercollege.com](http://theculturebarbercollege.com).\nNWI Business Ins and Outs: Unbeatable Eatables, DRIPBaR Crown Point, Taco Depot and Flashback Antiques open; Da Burger House closes\nOpen\nOpen\nRead\nOpen\nOpen\nOpen\nOpen\nOpen\nClosed\n219 News Now: Check out the weekend forecast with Matt Holiner 5/12/23\n[\nNWI Business Ins and Outs: Biggby Coffee, Flora Plants, Funk My Life and McDonald's open; Aster & Gray and Elements Wine Bar close](/niche/inbusiness/nwi-business-ins-and-outs-biggby-coffee-flora-plants-funk-my-life-and-mcdonalds-open/collection_b31acb72-ebeb-11ed-80d6-3b1a3e184359.html)\nNWI Business Ins and Outs: Biggby Coffee, Flora Plants, Funk My Life and McDonald's open; Aster & Gray and Elements Wine Bar close\nClass UFC Gym in Winfield to celebrate grand opening with top contender Belal Muhammad\nThe Class UFC Gym in Winfield will have a grand opening Saturday with top welterweight UFC title contender Belal Muhammad.\nMuhammad, a Chicago-based fighter with a 23-3 record in the mixed martial arts, will do a meet-and-greet and teach a class at the grand opening, which will take place from 12 to 4 p.m. Saturday at the gym at 10660 Randolph St. in Winfield.\nThe high-end gym focuses on classes, specializing in boutique boxing conditioning, kickboxing and HIIT, or High Intensity Interval Training.
