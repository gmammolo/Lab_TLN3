  "text": "U-M expands tuition-free program to students from families earning up to $125K Dave Boucher Detroit Free Press Show Caption\nHide Caption\nThe University of Michigan in Ann Arbor: Key facts Explore key facts about the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, including its rich history, academic programs, notable alumni, and world-class research facilities. More people will soon be able to attend the University of Michigan without paying tuition thanks to the Ann Arbor-based school expanding a program for current and future in-state students.\nStarting in the fall, the university's \"Go Blue Guarantee\" will cover tuition for any student from a family with an annual income of $125,000 and assets of up to $125,000, according to a news release issued Thursday. That's a substantial increase from the previous $75,000 parameter.\n“The Go Blue Guarantee breaks down economic barriers and ensures that a world-class education is available to Michigan students from all backgrounds, no matter their family’s economic means,” said U-M President Santa Ono in a statement.\nNew students and returning students who fall under the new income criterion are eligible. According to the program website , there is no separate application necessary to be considered for this financial aid at the Ann Arbor campus. New students at the Dearborn and Flint campuses are also eligible.\nMore: U-M researchers seek pancreatic cancer 'Holy Grail': An early detection test\nMore: Young leaders with Michigan connections make Forbes' 30 under 30 list: Who they are\nSince launching the program in 2018, the university says it has covered the tuition of more than 8,000 students.\n“As a state university, we have a responsibility to serve the people of Michigan and — given the many pressures of today’s economy — we want to ensure that working-class and middle-class Michiganders can send their children to this great university and benefit from all that it offers,” said Katherine White, chair of the Board of Regents, in a statement.\nThe expanded eligibility comes at a time when higher education costs continue to soar. The total cost to attend a four-year college — tuition, fees, room and board, etc. — increased more than 156% from 1963 to 2021, according to the National Center for Education Statistics .\nThis year, in-state students at the Ann Arbor campus pay about $17,700 for tuition. However, the university says 63% of in-state undergraduate students at the main campus receive grant or scholarship aid.\nExpanding the program will cost the university about $8.8 million every year, the university stated.\nReach Dave Boucher at dboucher@freepress.com and on X @Dave_Boucher1.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
