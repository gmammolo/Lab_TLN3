  "text": "On December 4, 2024, School Board Member Roberto J. Alonso, District 4, joined by Miami-Dade County Commissioner Oliver Gilbert, along with local school and community leaders, gathered at American Senior High School to celebrate the groundbreaking of a new, state-of-the-art track and football field. This facility, located at the heart of the school, will become a cornerstone of physical education, student athletics, and community engagement for years to come.\nThe ceremony marked the official beginning of construction for a cutting-edge, multi-purpose athletic facility designed to support a wide array of student sports activities. The new venue will foster physical fitness, bolster school spirit, and enhance community pride. Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) is overseeing the construction of this advanced athletic complex, which will feature an artificial turf field suitable for both football and soccer, as well as an upgraded track that will accommodate track and field events, including pole vaulting, long jump, triple jump, and high jump.\nAs a long-time advocate for educational excellence, family engagement, and athletic development, Board Member Roberto J. Alonso expressed his excitement for the project. “I am absolutely thrilled to celebrate the start of this incredible initiative,” said Board Member Alonso. “This new track and football field will not only provide our student-athletes with a top-tier space to train and compete, but it will also serve as a gathering place for community events, fitness programs, and school activities. It’s an investment in the future of our students and our community.”\n“Yesterday, we also recognized Ms. Annie Perez, an Adapted Physical Education Teacher, and Frankie Ruiz, an exceptional running coach and Race Director, whose collective efforts were pivotal in the development of this new track. Their commitment to encouraging physical activity and making sports accessible to every child has had and will continue to have a lasting impact on generations of students,” Mr. Alonso concluded.\nThis transformative project is made possible by the support of the local community and funding from the 2012 voter-approved General Obligation Bond. This bond has played a pivotal role in modernizing school facilities and supporting much-needed construction projects throughout the district. M-DCPS remains steadfast in its commitment to creating high-quality, dynamic spaces that promote physical health, teamwork, and school pride. The new track and football field will be a vital resource for the community, benefiting athletes of all ages and abilities.\nABOUT US:\nFor more Miami community news, look no further than Miami Community Newspapers.
