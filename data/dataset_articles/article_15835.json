  "text": "OAKLAND — Students in several schools in Garrett County are benefitting from regular visits with therapy dogs.\nShannon Haley, Licensed Clinical Social Worker-Certified (LCSW-C), explained that the opportunity came via Dr. Allyson Martz.\n“Prior to GCPS adopting a policy and procedure for using therapy animals in schools, there was confusion over what constituted a therapy animal, what was the purpose, and how would any medical issues due to allergies or injuries be covered?” she said. “We were able to develop the current process by exploration, examination, and sometimes elimination.”\nFor example, the language includes “animal assisted interventions” to include using animals for incentives for students making progress and for de-escalation when students are anxious or sad.\nThe animal therapy team must be certified by an appropriate therapy animal agency, which requires the animal pass health and behavioral assessments and requires the handler to have an additional criminal background check.\nWhile most therapy animal agencies provide liability insurance for volunteer services, the team must obtain additional insurance riders to cover services provided while the handler is serving his/her workplace (such as counselor, social worker, or psychologist).\nThe dogs and their handlers are considered a team and must adhere to the written rules, policies, and procedures laid out by both Garrett County Public Schools and the Alliance of Therapy Dogs.\nWith administrative and parent approval, therapy dog teams can visit the schools and the students who are interested.\n“While the entire student body is included in and impacted by the dogs, students with emotional and behavioral needs have been a targeted intervention group with our therapy dog teams as this offers a very unique approach to meeting diverse needs,” Haley said.\nThe team is made up of Carrie Hook, LCSW-C, with Penny, Haley with Ruby and Martz with Roxy.\nAfter witnessing the impact that the other two therapy dogs in the county were having, Haley became interested in having Ruby come to school with her.\n“Dr. Martz and Mrs. Hook helped get me started,” she said. “I applied through the Alliance of Therapy dogs meeting requirements such as a background check for myself, health record check for Ruby, reference letters, and ultimately passing an in-person test as a therapy dog team.”\nShe then had to be approved by Garrett County Public Schools and get parent permission for each student Ruby would visit.\nCurrent schools involved include Northern High School, Northern Middle School, Grantsville Elementary, Yough Glades, Crellin Elementary, Swan Meadow, Broad Ford Elementary and Friendsville Elementary.\n“As the school social worker, I provide a variety of support to students through individual and group sessions,” Haley said.\nShe noted that Penny especially loves greeting students as they arrive at school in the morning and seeing them off in the afternoons.\n“Penny is also instrumental in helping students that are grieving, feeling lonely, having a bad day or struggling to find acceptance,” Haley said. “Penny definitely doesn’t discriminate and loves to spend time with anyone that will make eye contact with her.”\nRuby has become somewhat of a school mascot at Yough Glades. She visits individual students during their counseling sessions and also visits classrooms where students take turns petting her, asking dog related questions, and learning about what it means to be a therapy dog.\n“Students are so excited when they see her walking down the hall,” Haley said. “ She brings a lot of smiles, sometimes to kids who don’t often smile.”\nRuby is a nine year old chocolate lab that Haley has owned since she is a puppy.\n“She has FINALLY become calm enough to be a good therapy dog,” Haley said. “She is gentle, sweet, and enjoys belly rubs. Her personality has been perfect for the students she interacts with. When she is not at school, Ruby enjoys hiking off leash, napping in my bed, begging for treats, and ignoring her little brother Dougie.”\nPenny is a two year old golden retriever who is “super friendly” and thrives in the school setting.\n“She really loves going to work and all the attention she gets while she is there,” Haley said. “She is super playful, friendly and engaging. She loves to go for walks, play with our other dogs and especially loves to snuggle. She also loves going to baseball games.”\nRoxy is a two-year-old Sheepadoodle.",
