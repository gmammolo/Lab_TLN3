  "text": "Summer Experience: Cody Losey ’26L\nMeet Siju Oshin ’26L: Legal Fellow with the International Refugee Assistance Project This semester, Siju Oshin is working in an independent research position with a global legal aid and advocacy organization.\nSiju Oshin ‘26L is from Laurel, MD. She graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2020 with a degree in psychology and a minor in sociology. Before coming to law school, she worked at local non-profits in Maryland dedicated to locating affordable housing and providing legal representation/resources for tenants in court. Last summer, she was a legal intern with the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project in Washington, D.C. This spring she will be a legal intern with Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics, and this summer, she will be a summer associate with Swift, Currie, McGhee, and Hiers LLP in their Atlanta, GA office. Currently, Siju is engaged in an independent research position with the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), a global legal aid and advocacy organization.\nDescribe your work with IRAP.\nMost of my research and work has been focused on a specific case for a client that is in the process of applying for a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) after working overseas on behalf of the U.S. government. Most recently I have been working on drafting a declaration to appeal their denial of the SIV, which has involved conducting client interviews, gathering research regarding different subcontracts and their connection to the U.S. government, as well as reviewing client documents such as employment records, letters of recommendation, and other personal documents. This is to ensure that the information included in their declaration is accurate, while also making sure that we are addressing and resolving issues that may have led to their initial denial.\nHow did you get this position?\nGoogle! I knew coming into 2L year that I wanted to do an internship at a non-profit during the school year, so I used Google to see if I could find any organizations that were looking for law students. I came across IRAP and was immediately drawn to the work they do regarding immigration and refugee rights, especially because I am a first-generation American. I submitted my application, interviewed a few weeks later, and was offered the position a few weeks after that!\nWhat has been your greatest takeaway as a legal fellow?\nI think doing this work has really emphasized the importance of the non-profit legal sector. Coming into this internship I knew that immigration work was complex, but after engaging with this work, I’ve gotten to see how intricate it really is and to witness firsthand the impact it has on clients. At times the work can be emotionally taxing, but providing meaningful assistance to people definitely makes it worth it.\nIs there a way for fellow law students or prospective law students to get involved?\nFor IRAP specifically, applications for fellows for the 2025-2026 school year will open in the summer, and this opportunity is open to both 2Ls and 3Ls. More generally, I would encourage law students to be willing to take more initiative. The Office of Career Strategy is wonderful, but if you have specific interests that you would like to explore that they may not have information about, don’t be afraid to branch out and look for opportunities on your own! Also, utilize the alumni network. In my experience, they’re always willing to make time to speak with current students.",
