  "text": "Choosing a major can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to. With the right approach, you can feel confident and excited about the wide range of major options available—for undergrad and graduate degrees alike.\nResearch Prerequisites for Various Careers\nSome careers require specific degrees as a stepping stone, while others allow for more flexibility. Engineering and cybersecurity degrees tend to be more specific, while degrees in business, finance and communications offer versatility and can be applied across many career paths.\nMeet with aN Advisor\nCollege advisors are invaluable resources when it comes to navigating the maze of available majors. Even if you have clear academic interests, meeting with an advisor can offer insights you might not have considered. Advisors are skilled at helping students explore all possible pathways, helping to navigate different ways to achieve your goals.\nTake a Career Assessment\nCareer assessments aren’t magic solutions, but they can offer helpful guidance by identifying strengths, interests, and potential career paths. These assessments may reveal aspects of your personality or skills not previously considered, and may introduce exciting and unexpected career options.\nWhether you’ve had your career path mapped out since kindergarten or are just beginning to explore your options, rest assured there is a major that suits your future. With support from your network and a clear focus, you’ll be one step closer to confidently declaring your major and stepping into your next chapter.",
