  "text": "Report, Don’t Repost: Carson City School District combats spread of misinformation\nRENO, Nev. (KOLO) - The Carson City Sheriff’s Office and the Carson City School District are working together to create an initiative that helps teach parents and students how to respond to concerning activities or social media posts.\nThey call it: Report, Don’t Repost.\nThe main goal is to minimize the reposting or posting of threats of violence or possible incidents because that makes it harder for law enforcement to identify where an incident may be occurring or originated.\n“We so frequently are so tangled in a web of ‘where did this threat originate from’ and ‘how can we best approach who all is involved.’ The reposting just creates more data and people we have to go through, and it seriously hampers investigations,” says Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong.\nIf students or parents come across posts that threaten violence, harm or injury, they are encouraged to:\nAvoid reposting with others, as this only escalates fear and panic.\nTake a screenshot of the post.\nReport the post to local law enforcement, a school administrator or teacher\nCopyright 2024 KOLO.
