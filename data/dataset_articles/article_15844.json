  "text": "Students at Laurel High School are getting creative with their Christmas toilet fundraiser to attend a leadership conference next year. The Family Career Community Leaders of America club is raising funds by moving a decorated toilet from yard to yard, with a portion of proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nLAUREL, Mont. – Students at Laurel High School are embracing the holiday spirit in a unique way to fund their trip to a leadership conference next year.\nMembers of the Family Career Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) club are hosting a Christmas toilet fundraiser for the second consecutive year. The club, which focuses on leadership skills and family values, is raising money to attend a state leadership conference in March.\nJennifer Painter, the club advisor, emphasized the importance of family and community support. \"In this day and age family has lost its way so if we have students at an early age the family is where your support lies and after that, that's where community support comes in. I feel that's where family, career, and community all go hand in hand,\" she said.\nClub members Kat Campbell, Raylea Brown, and Bryce Leonhardt explained the creative fundraiser. \"It's a toilet that our advisor got, don't worry it is clean and it's new, we just decorated it for Christmas. The first person that gets it in their yard, can either pay $10 for us to remove it and put it in someone else's yard that we choose, or they can pay $20 and you get to choose which house it goes to next. The more times we move it, the more money we get, and as a group we also decided that 10% of the money we make will be donated to the 'Make-A-Wish Foundation,'\" they said.\nLast year, the students raised approximately $400 and hope to surpass that amount this year. Painter expressed her hopes for community support, stating, \"Donating to this club helps future generations and it really gives those kids skills that they need further down the road in life.\"\nFor those interested in participating or displaying the FCCLA Christmas toilet in their yard, Painter can be contacted via email (Jennifer_painter@laurel.k12.mt.us).\nThis fundraiser not only supports the students' educational goals but also contributes to a charitable cause, making it a community effort during the festive season.\nMore from this section New Historical Fiction Novel Delves Into the Brutality of Impressment in 18th and 19th Century England Celebrities and coastal residents flee from wind-driven wildfire in Malibu Deer shot & left to waste in Blaine County after general season ends, authorities seek info",
