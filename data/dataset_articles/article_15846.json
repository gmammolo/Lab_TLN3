  "text": "Jeremiah Donati has been named the 31st Director of Athletics at the University of South Carolina, President Michael Amiridis announced on December 5, following a meeting with the Board of Trustees. Donati joined USC after serving as athletics director at Texas Christian University (TCU) since 2017. Under his leadership, TCU achieved significant success, including eight national championships, 11 Big 12 Conference titles, and the school’s first appearance in the College Football Playoffs. TCU’s men’s basketball team has reached three consecutive NCAA Tournaments, and its baseball team won back-to-back Big 12 championships and appeared in the College World Series. \"I’m honored to join the University of South Carolina, a school with a rich history of athletic excellence and passionate fans,\" said Donati. \"I look forward to working alongside our exceptional coaches, student-athletes, and staff to continue building on the tremendous success of Gamecock Athletics. Our goal is to be a national leader in both competitive excellence and student-athlete experience. We will compete for championships while ensuring our student-athletes are supported in all aspects of their college careers.\" Donati’s experience at TCU includes overseeing significant facility upgrades and enhancing the student-athlete experience, with nearly $500 million invested in athletics facilities. He also helped raise record levels of donor support for TCU athletics and led fundraising initiatives like the Tomlinson Student-Athlete Development Endowment Fund. \"I am thrilled to welcome Jeremiah Donati to Gamecock Nation,\" said USC President Michael Amiridis. \"Jeremiah's accomplishments at TCU speak for themselves. His leadership will be invaluable as we continue to build on the successes of Gamecock Athletics and ensure that our student-athletes have the support and resources they need to compete at the highest level.\" Before becoming TCU's AD, Donati held various roles at TCU, including Deputy Athletics Director, where he was instrumental in fundraising and project development. He also has experience working with Leigh Steinberg Sports & Entertainment and in fundraising for the University of Arizona, Washington State, and Cal Poly. Donati succeeds Ray Tanner, who served as USC's Athletics Director since 2012 and will become athletics director emeritus and senior advisor to the president. Donati holds a bachelor’s degree in politics and government from the University of Puget Sound and a law degree from Whittier Law School. Under Donati, TCU saw record donor support for its athletics program. In the four years he led fundraising for the Frog Club, TCU achieved its three highest totals in athletics donations. The school also set records for men's basketball attendance and reached new highs in ticket and licensing revenues. In March 2019, Donati partnered with TCU football legend LaDainian Tomlinson to create the Tomlinson Student-Athlete Development Endowment Fund, aimed at helping TCU student-athletes prepare for life and careers after graduation. Donati and his wife, Nicole, have two daughters, Colette and Naomi. The search for the new Director of Athletics started in September 2024, with help from Funk Associates executive search firm.",
