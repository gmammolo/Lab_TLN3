  "text": "By Melissa Torres ,\n3 hours ago\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – A school in northwest Albuquerque is implementing an innovative tool to promote the love of reading and boost student success.\nStory continues below\nTrending: City looking at potentially expanding tram service outside the ABQ BioPark News: Solar and battery storage project opens in Bernalillo County for PNM customers Politics: There are more women than men in New Mexico’s legislature for the first time Sports: Lobo basketball player speaks out about alleged attack by teammate Students are able to earn bookworm tokens in the classroom for reaching attendance milestones, excelling at reading, or going above and beyond by participating in school activities. And put those tokens towards books in this vending machine. “I love reading so much and I personally just went to the book fair and now I have a bunch of cool books and now I get this book and it’s so awesome,” said 2nd grade student Ava.\nMarie Hughes Elementary School has been working with the Taylor Ranch Neighborhood Association to purchase the vending machine and they finally unveiled it on Tuesday.\n“When we unveiled it, the cheers the wondering, the parents walking by and asking staff members about how do I get one of those? How do I get a book? Was really exciting to see, so I’m just thrilled to see people wanting to read and having a way to promote reading,” said Principal Jenna Bludworth.\nThe goal is to encourage reading by making books a reward with the novelty of the vending machine that gives students a book of their choice that they can keep. “I think that we have to keep things exciting and fun and that’s how we get students interested,” continued Bludworth. “And that is the goal as soon as we get them interested this is easy to stay interested in it’s getting them here. And this is the vessel to create a love of reading.”\nSo far, the machine has been a success and students are looking forward to earning more tokens. “I got a token to put in the vending machine to get a book and it’s pretty nice,” said 3rd grade student Mattison.\nPrincipal Bludworth told KRQE News 13 that she wants every student to be able to use the machine so they are still coming up with ways to earn tokens.\nFor those interested in donating new books to go inside the vending machine, you can contact Marie Hughes Elementary directly.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
