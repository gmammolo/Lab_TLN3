  "text": "EUGENE, Ore. – Bethel School District officials want to ensure every student feels seen, supported, and included and, to get there, is forming a school board advisory committee on educational equity.\nThe committee will include parents and guardians, students, staff members, and people in the community which will, collectively, advise on policies that impact underserved student groups, share insights on equity challenges and successes, and help shape strategies for an inclusive future.\nThe district’s assistant superintendent, Remie Calalang, said that encouraging engagement is a key component in the committee’s success.\n“By formalizing this committee,” Calalang said, “and identifying and clearly making it an advisory committee to the school board and also the superintendent, helps us ensure that those voices stay engaged in our process and it becomes a group that we can than turn to if we have wonderings or questions.”\nMembers will have to commit to quarterly meetings and those who are interested in applying may do so by visiting the Bethel School District’s\nwebsite. For more information, or call Calalang at 541-689-3280.",
