  "text": "WAUSAU, Wis. (WSAW) - Kids from around the world are finding refuge in Mr. Chi’s class inside Wausau’s Horace Mann Middle School.\n“Every morning be like, ‘Good morning Mr. Chi!’”\nMr. Chi Neng Vang is a multilingual teacher and leads the Newcomer’s class for students that began this year. The class is for students who are coming to the community as refugees . Here, they get English lessons and cultural orientation about systems and norms Americans grew up learning, such as school expectations or incorporating basic money systems into a math lesson.\nThe students’ first period begins with advisory where Chi goes over reminders and allows students to ask questions. From there, students who have gotten past a certain level of English proficiency quickly move on to classes with their American peers. Others spend the rest of the first half of the day learning those lessons with their fellow newcomers. Then, they join their American peers for the last half of the day.\n“This class is the class that we really like,” student Zaki Hassan smiled. “We have Mr. Chi who helps us every time.”\n“It’s fun. It’s good,” Sangwa Bin Makay, who goes by “Justice,” said.\n“Mr. Chi is (a) good teacher,” Karen Rojas Gutierrez, who goes by “Tatiana,” added.\nChi said this class is the students’ comfort zone. He has been wanting to start this class since getting hired at the school three years ago, around the same time the refugee resettlement agency in Wausau was forming. He understood they needed a safe place to learn and make mistakes.\n“You put them in regular class, they will not talk at all.”\nThe students affirmed that.\n“The other classes is hard,” Tatiana stated.\n“Other classes, we don’t know each other very well,” Zaki said, “So, that’s (been) difficult.”\n“I’m scared in the other classes,” Justice admitted. “I just sit like a little voice. Even if people are working, I just wait for the teacher to come ask me because I don’t know what to do.”\nChi knows that fear. Twenty years ago, an 11-year-old Chi got on a bus in Thailand with his siblings to resettle in America. Speaking only Hmong, he and other refugees in Wausau had to learn a new culture and new systems, all in a new language. He said he was bullied.\n“‘Hey, you don’t even know how to speak English. You shouldn’t be here,’ and then I start crying because I told my mom, I don’t want to be here.”\nIt was not like his life back at the Wat Tham Krabok refugee camp was pleasant. He said his parents had to put them in an orphanage so he and his siblings could have some access to education.\n“I don’t really like to talk about it because it was just bad. It was just like, like, (a) very bad experience, like, no food, you have no clothes.”\nZaki Hassan is a middle school student in Wausau who came from Somalia in the spring of 2024. He enjoys the fun, safe space that his Newcomers class provides. (WSAW) The kids in his class are coming from similar challenges. In an area of extreme famine in Somalia , Zaki often could not go to school.\n“My mom paid the school fees, but if we did not pay, I don’t go.”\n“In Colombia , it’s difficult for money ,” Tatiana said about her home country. Jobs are tough to find as well.\nThe students are adjusting to life in America and looking to fit in at school Justice was born in a refugee settlement in Zimbabwe after her Congolese family fled seeking safety, though it still was not safe there.\n“At night during the hours, people come into your house with guns and steal things and go. It was hard. And the government doesn’t do anything with that.”\nShe said you could not be outside past about 4 or 5 o’clock or risk running into “bad people.”\n“They can even kill you. You have to stay at home, like starting at 4 p.m. School was dismissed at like 1 p.m. But here, I can even stay outside at 5 p.m.”\nHer family waited for that kind of safety for, at least, her 14 years of life.\nAdd those past experiences with trying to find a sense of belonging like every other middle school student. While some newcomers have found American friends, like Zaki who said he does not feel lonely, others struggle.\n“If another student maybe sees you in their class, would you want them to come talk to you,” 7 Investigates’ Emily Davies asked.\n“Yeah, but they don’t,” Justice responded.\nShe shared an experience during the first days of school where she was too afraid to talk with teachers about where she was supposed to go next. She tried asking a group of girls, but she said they shrugged her off. She noted she has not felt bullied in her time at school, but she finds it difficult to make connections with kids outside of the Newcomer’s class.\nNot knowing or having people assume they do not know English can be a barrier. However, each of the students 7 Investigates interviewed did not know English before their arrival in Wausau this spring and the interviews were conducted without an interpreter. They have learned a lot in a short time.\nEven when they cannot hold a conversation in a common language, the students find ways to connect and communicate. Justice and Tatiana became “best friends” almost immediately, despite not sharing a common language. They said they use a form of sign language when they do not have the words to communicate.\nAsk any newcomer and they will likely say learning English is their toughest task as they acclimate to their new home.\n“I would say I’m trying my best,” Zaki said about what he wanted his American peers to know.\nAll of these dynamics bring Chi back to his childhood, which helps him address the needs these kids have to help themselves and their families.\n“What are they thinking right now? Like, do they want to be here, or do they not want to be here,” he said. “I need to get them comfortable with not just in school, but outside of school first, so that they can go home and help their parents too.”\nHe is providing that space by centering love, safety, and acceptance in his lessons to give them room to thrive.\n“As a newcomer myself, experienced myself, we want to learn, they want to learn. You just have to be patient.”\nThe ECDC says interacting with refugees just like you would with other neighbors is a good start Copyright 2024 WSAW.
