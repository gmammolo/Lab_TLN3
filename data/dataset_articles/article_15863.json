  "text": "Two new child-care facilities at Richmond schools are expected to be finished by fall of next year. Richmond Board of Education's Facilities meeting on Dec. 4 reviewed current and upcoming capital projects including the new child-care facilities. Spul'u'kwuks and Garden City elementary schools are expected to have child-care spaces - accommodating around 50 children in each - for daycare and before and after school programs. Each child-care centre will cost $1.98 million to build. Building permit applications for both were submitted in August and the facilities are expected to be completed by September 2025 within budget, according to a school district facilities and building committee agenda . Diefenbaker elementary also recently received provincial funding of more than $50 million for seismic upgrades, which includes a new neighbourhood learning centre with services such as child care. In August, $8.2 million in grants was approved by the provincial and federal governments to open 220 new licensed child-care spaces across the city and on school grounds. This includes eight spaces for infants and toddlers, 100 spaces for children 30 months to kindergarten age and 112 spaces for school-age care across the city. Richmond School District now has seven purpose-built child-care facilities. These are at Tomsett, Maple Lane, Manoah Steves, Whiteside, McKinney and William Bridge elementary schools and at the Mitchell Adult Education Centre.
