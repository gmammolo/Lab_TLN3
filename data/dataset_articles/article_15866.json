  "text": "LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - Flu season is back. Doctors said skipping the flu shot could lead to more severe cases, especially as families gather for the holidays.There has been a significant decline in the number of people getting the flu shot. State health officials said this year only one in four people have had the shot.Most people already know that getting an annual flu shot is the most effective way to prevent the virus. It lowers the chances of having serious complications or dying.The CDC said that everyone six months or older qualifies for a jab.“Well I’m going to get it. I haven’t gotten it yet, but I’m going to get it in a couple weeks.” Don Telles said he gets a flu shot every year to protect himself because he’s been sick with the flu one too many times.Telles said, “You have no energy. You’ve got aches and pains all over the place, and, like I said, you’re just lethargic. You have no energy. You try to do something and you just can’t do it.”“I get my flu shot because it’s crappy to be sick.” Thomas Garza said he already has his seasonal flu shot. “I go get my flu shot from the VA.”In Michigan, there’s been a yearly decline in seasonal flu shots since 2020. The number has decreased from 34% to 26% in those four years .Rebecca Shein with UMH-Sparrow Pediatrics said, “Flu seems like it’s not such a big deal and most of the time it’s not. You’re sick for about a week to 10 days and you don’t feel good, but it’s not the end of the world, but it can cause many severe side effects.”Severe side effects like meningitis or pneumonia. Shein said vaccination is crucial for pregnant people, young children, and older adults.“The county, the CDC, every year they watch who’s getting sick and they look at those flu strains,” Garza said, “So then they kind of predict what this winter’s flu strains are going to be and that’s why we get a flu shot every year. Next shot’s not the same as last year.”According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the flu shot takes about two weeks for your body’s immune system to create enough antibodies to fight off the virus. So, they recommend getting your shot sooner rather than later.If you need to get a flu shot, you can go to your local health department or pharmacy.
