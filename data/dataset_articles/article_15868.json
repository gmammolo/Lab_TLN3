  "text": "Studies for the inaugural technician class are underway at Peterbilt Technician Institute’s (PTI) new Denver, Colorado, location , situated on the campus of Lincoln Tech, the company announced. Denver is the fourth PTI site.\nThe company said the inaugural Denver class includes a diverse group of men and women, including military veterans and a member of the National Technician Honor Society. Peterbilt said each PTI student brings a range of experiences and backgrounds to enhance the learning environment and collaboration within the cohort.\n“This dynamic group of students reflects the growing interest in the PTI tailored curriculum and focus on work-ready skills,” said Danny Landholm, director of Dealer Network Development for Peterbilt. “The Denver location reinforces our commitment to strengthen the number of qualified service technicians to support evolving vehicle technologies, maximizing uptime for our Peterbilt customers.”\nThe company said PTI offers students 12 weeks of comprehensive training on Peterbilt equipment. The program covers various systems on the truck, including fuel, electrical, HVAC, suspension, brakes, aftertreatment and PACCAR MX engines.\nThe PTI program combines classroom and hands-on training to help build practical experience, according to Peterbilt, which added that it emphasizes teamwork to enhance communication skills, while incorporating web-based skill-building activities to ensure technicians possess comprehensive technical knowledge.\nUpon completion of the program, students will earn factory-trained technician credentials that can fast-track them to careers at more than 425 Peterbilt dealerships across the United States and Canada, the company added.",
