  "text": "Christmas wishes continue to be granted for Waco students thanks to program created by dearly departed coach Mike Chapman\nWACO, Texas (KWTX) - Shopping is underway as hundreds of Christmas wishes are being granted for students in need as a program continues for the 16th year and fourth year after losing its founder, beloved University Head Soccer Coach Mike Chapman.\nThe Make A Wish Come True program is poised this year to be a huge success.\n“This year, between all four elementary schools, we will be sponsoring 300 students,” Dylan Chapman said.\nDylan is the head baseball coach at University High School and nephew of Mike Chapman.\nHe, along with family, supporters and friends, knew they wanted to keep Mike’s passion project going following his shocking death from a heart attack in 2020.\nMike saw a need in 2008 to help struggling kids at Christmas time and started the project by granting a few wishes.\nWith the help of the school’s Junior ROTC program and First Sgt. Leonard Montelongo, Make a Wish Come True has grown bigger very year.\nThe wishes are primarily granted for students at Alta Vista Elementary School, Bell’s Hill Elementary School, South Waco Elementary School and Kendrick Elementary School.\nThe students write a short essay in response to the question, “What would you do with 100 dollars.”\n“Most kid would write you’d think for toys and their Santa wish lists but you’d be surprised how many letters of kids we get asking for blankets, jackets, coats, money so that the heat can be turned back on , things that truly touch your heart,” Dylan said.\nDylan says the elementary gifts have all been sponsored, with the Bowen Family Foundation, founded by Waco native and singer Wade Bowen, taking care of the wishes of two entire elementary schools as they’ve done several years in the past.\nThe Baylor Business School sponsors one other elementary with Bird-Kultgen Ford sponsoring Alta Vista.\nDylan says that organizers are now focused on gathering gift cards for older students at Cesar Chavez Middle School and University High School.\n“What we still need right now is either cash donations or gift card donations to like Walmart, Target, or HEB in $25 increments that we can use to sponsor our middle school and high school kids so we can sponsor their Christmas wishes, too,” Dylan said.\nIf you’d like to donate a gift card you can deliver to University High School.\nIf you’d like to help in any other way you can contact Dylan by emailing him at [Dylan.Chapman@wacoisd.org](mailto:Dylan.Chapman@wacoisd.org) or Kyle Chapman at [Kyle.Chapman@wacoisd.org](mailto:Kyle.Chapman@wacoisd.org).\nCopyright 2024 KWTX.
