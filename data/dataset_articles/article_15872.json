  "title": "A new primary school in the heart of Lévis by 2027",
  "text": "By the start of the 2027 school year, a brand new primary school will take root in the heart of Lévis, a stone’s throw from the Cité de la Coopération and the UMANO district, thanks to the purchase by the City of Lévis of land at a cost of $5.6 million belonging to Desjardins Group.\nThis project received the green light from Quebec in June 2023, but we had to wait a year before finding land on which to build it, which represented quite a challenge in this sector, indicated the general director of the Center de services scolaire des Navigators, Suzie Lucas, at a press briefing Thursday afternoon.\nThe impasse was finally resolved thanks to collaboration with Mouvement Desjardins, which agreed to sell part of its land to the City of Lévis, subsequently transferred to the school service center as provided for by current legislation.\nThe two partners ensure that the sum paid for this “exceptional purchase” corresponds to the “fair market value” of the land.\nThis lot, which was not for sale initially, could have brought in much more for Mouvement Desjardins if it had been put up for auction, said its president, Guy Cormier.\n300 students\nThe new school, which will accommodate 300 students, will bear the name of Dorimène Desjardins, the co-founder of the Desjardins Movement, to highlight this collaboration.\nThe establishment will be located at the corner of Saint-Omer and des Commandeurs streets, near the Pointe-Lévy secondary school and the campus of the University of Quebec in Rimouski, a geographical proximity which will make it possible to accommodate interns in teaching and research projects, said Mme Lucas.\nThis construction of a “new generation” primary school will make it possible to “decongest” the three other establishments in the sector, which are full to bursting.\nOverflowing schools\nThe need for space in the schools of the Navigators Service Center will nevertheless remain acute in the coming years, since Lévis is one of the Quebec municipalities with the highest growth.\nThe service center had submitted 20 projects to add space last fall, but only five projects to purchase modular classrooms received the green light from Quebec recently.\nPresent during the press briefing, the Minister of Education, Bernard Drainville, recognized that the sums allocated for new school construction and expansion projects are far from sufficient to meet needs.\n“Is this enough? No,” he said, while asserting that the pace of investments in recent years was “not sustainable” in the long term.\nThis explains why the school network must increasingly turn to temporary premises, which represent a real lifeline in the circumstances, indicated Mr.me Lucas.\n“We are saved by the modular ones, we must say it,” she said, while specifying that these temporary classes will be there for several more years. We will have to learn to live with it to be able to meet our needs.”\nDo you have any information to share with us about this story?\nWrite to us at or call us directly at 1 800-63SCOOP.",
