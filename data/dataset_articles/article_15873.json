  "text": "By Valeria Rodriguez ,\n12 hours ago\nYUMA, Ariz. (KYMA, KECY) - One local organization is dedicated to helping locals in need and the holiday season is no exception.\nAt the Walmart located on Pacific Avenue, Yuma residents can see a huge Christmas tree just as they walk in where the Salvation Army put up name tags of kids all across Yuma County as part of their annual Angel Tree.\nThere are name tags of kids of all ages, which include their clothing and shoe size along with a thing or two they like.\n\"I mean I want kids to wake up at Christmas and have a present under the tree,\" said Otilia Condie, Store Manager for the Walmart on Pacific Avenue.\nCondie was able to donate $2,000 to the Salvation Army. She says it's important for her to be able to give back.\n\"We Walmart managers, we have the opportunity to help through the community. I mean we help in the food bank, we help the Salvation Army, Toys for Tots,\" Condie expressed adding that she wants to create a positive ripple effect among the community. \"We want Walmart to be the best place so that the associates can work and the best place to shop for our customers.\"\nCondie says it's important for her to able to give back as she knows what it's like to be in need.\n\"I mean, I grew up in a family on the other side of the border, and I see how the families...how some families don't have the funds to have a Christmas for their kids,\" Condie shared.\nLt. Jonathan Herzog, the Salvation Army Corps. Officer, says it's a full-circle moment that drives him to give back to the community.\n\"You know, my family was a family that was rescued Salvation Army. We know what it is like to be in need,\" Herzog explained.\nAll the gifts collected will be distributed later this month.\nThe post Salvation Army puts up Angel Tree appeared first on KYMA .",
