  "text": "Approximately 57 thousand teachers will receive a bonus of 4 million 500 thousand pesos to be paid over six years . The Government’s proposal was accepted by a majority in agreement with the Teaching Body and will now have to be approved by Congress . Mario Aguilar, president of the union, declared that “this is a little justice in a number of years that we wish there were fewer. Healing wounds is good, repairing injustices is good.” “It fills me with pride to be the Minister of Education who can put this innovation on the table,” said Nicolás Cataldo .\n“The century”. Santiago. 30/10/2024 . 82% of the country’s teachers voted in favor of accepting the Government’s proposal to grant them a bonus of 4 million 500 thousand pesos, to be paid over six years, to put an end to the State’s “ historic debt ” with teachers teachers, which has been going on for almost half a century.\nThe teaching body organized a consultation with its members so that “they could decide whether or not to accept the Government’s proposal”. Electronic voting was established through the Evoting platform with the participation of 28,780 teachers. 22,323 of them demonstrated, 82%. “ Agree”, with the bonus of over 4 million 4 thousand 832, 17%, voted “I do not agree”.\nThe union sent this information to the Ministry of Education, where the news was well received, and now the Executive is sending the initiative to Congress where it will have to be approved or rejected. Mario Aguilar, president of the teachers’ union, said that “I hope that (the project) has transversality and unanimity, because our colleagues have waited 43 years.” In fact, around 20 thousand teachers have died in recent years and have not been able to see the right benefit that corresponded to them; According to the plan their relatives do not inherit. Now around 57 thousand teachers will receive the bonus over six years.\nIt should be remembered that this “historic debt” originates from the money that was not paid to teachers when the the administration of educational institutions was transferred from the State to the Municipalities S to a extent imposed by the dictatorship as part of the expansion of private, paid education. This action prevented teachers from receiving a salary adjustment that corresponded to them, because this was unknown to the new employers and the State did not take on this debt.\nNicolás Cataldo said: “I am proud to be the Minister of Education who can put this innovation on the table. It is a historic event that I have the honor and privilege of being able to lead.”\nMario Aguilar, president of the Faculty Board, declared that “this is a bit of justice in a number of years that we would have liked to have seen fewer. Healing wounds is good, repairing injustices is good.”\nRegarding the consultation carried out in the union, he underlined that “the demonstration was clear and vigorous, in an impeccable and democratic process”, although he said that the bonus was modest considering what actually had to be paid to teachers following the historical debt.\nThe teacher leader invited Parliament to “hopefully approve the project unanimously, across the board, so that the government party and the opposition do not enter into the right-left struggle, because here there are 57 thousand people and families waiting 43 years old”.\nThe president of the teaching body declared that “healing wounds is good for our country, our society and our coexistence. We hope that this great injustice will be repaired and that in 2025 the first colleagues will be able to receive what the Government has offered.”\n#teachers #accepted #bonus #historic #debt",
