  "text": "Professor Rachel Saunders launched into her new position teaching Japanese Art History this fall, bringing her deep curatorial experience with and knowledge of Japanese art to Princeton’s collection in a special iteration of ART 217 / EAS 217 “The Arts of Japan.”\nThe course explored a broad range of media representing 5000 years of Japanese art history by delving into the life stories of individual things ranging from prehistoric ritual figurines and medieval mandalas or ‘impossible’ Zen paintings and ‘enlivened’ sculpture—to narrative paintings of the world’s oldest novel and sacred architectural sites—to contemporary protest art in Okinawa. The course also covered calligraphy, ink arts, photography, and, with the benefit of Princeton’s own robust collection, printing.\n“Professor Saunders places profound emphasis on the meticulous and sustained observation of artworks, providing an invaluable opportunity to truly learn how to ‘see’ artwork by patiently guiding us to look.\"\n— Yuchen Wang, A&A graduate student\n“For me, it’s been a breath of fresh air to see familiar material with new eyes, and to expand beyond the horizons of the class as originally conceived in response to individual interests and needs,” said Saunders. “In the last few weeks we’ve explored rarely introduced and very recently published work on some challenging topics, thanks to the interests and capacities of the group. They’ve been ready to tackle everything from prehistoric Jōmon archaeology to the ethics of painting in nuclear time.”\nArt & Archaeology senior Henry Moses had minimal experience with Japanese art before the course. “Coming in blind to the course was a bit worrisome,” he said, “However, what has been surprising and wonderful about the course is how we've used the content to think through really important historiographical and theoretical concerns. For example, our discussion of Kristopher Kersey's new book Facing Images: Medieval Japanese Art and the Problem of Modernity allowed us to discuss theoretical topics such as the creation of modernity, art historical recurrences and reverberations, afterlives, and interrogate historiographical topics like periodization and the problem of comparison. The discussion wasn't specific to Japanese art, but extended into our concerns about the discipline of art history in general.”\n“I’ve loved the shared dynamic and rhythm we’ve developed where everyone brings something new to the table at every meeting….For me it’s been very energizing!”\n— Professor Rachel Saunders\nExploring Princeton's collection\nParticipants agreed that seeing a selection of Princeton’s Japanese prints first hand was a highlight of the course.\n“Being able to interrogate a number of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in person really helped me grasp that central medium of Japanese art,” said Moses. “My reception of woodblock prints before the visit had been fairly dematerialized—mostly as images on my computer screen. However, seeing a selection of prints and the tools used to make them in person helped me understand the technical skill and material depth of the art form.”\nA&A graduate student Yuchen Wang agreed, “Close contact with the original piece becomes a conduit for connecting with the artisans across time and space, deepening our appreciation and understanding of their craft.”\nCritical visual analysis allowed the group to detect, in Wang’s words “the subtle traces left by the pressure of the block on the paper and the nuanced glossiness of the ink [which] elude photographic capture.” “As one moves under the light” he continued, “varying angles reveal different facets of the work, offering a dynamic visual experience.”\n“It was fantastic to be able to bring Edo period woodblock prints, rare books, and print-making tools from three different collections on campus together in one space to look very closely for several hours during the week we were covering woodblock printing in Japan. We could follow the entire process from sketch to proof to finished color print through these original works.”\n—Professor Rachel Saunders\nSaunders was thrilled to have Princeton’s collection as a teaching tool. “It was fantastic to be able to bring Edo period woodblock prints, rare books, and print-making tools from three different collections on campus together in one space to look very closely for several hours during the week we were covering woodblock printing in Japan,” she said. “We could follow the entire process from sketch to proof to finished color print through these original works. There’s no replacement for a first-hand understanding of the qualities of mulberry paper that make it so uniquely ideal for woodblock printing, or the depth of the colors or sophistication of textures being achieved in an industrial scale yet still hand-made, production process. This kind of encounter with the demands authentic response on multiple levels, which in turn helps us to re-think why works like these had so much impact when they traveled beyond Japan, and how we might return to them as we intervene in conventional Euro-American narratives of what exactly that impact was.”\nOf particular note in Princeton’s collection was the opportunity for the class to make close comparisons between seemingly similar works. “It was truly wonderful to be able to compare not one, but two editions of one of the most celebrated of all Japanese woodblock printed illustrated books, Gifts of the Ebb Tide (1789), designed by Kitagawa Utamaro (d.1806),” Saunders said. “It’s the most spectacularly seductive book – a fictive trip to the shoreline to collect shells morphs into a poetry competition, with paired poems written for each of the exquisitely illustrated shells collected. The printing of the individual shells arranged over pages of weed-scattered sand is magical – dusted with mica here and there so they shimmer, or blind printed to convey their ridged surfaces, for example. Princeton has a superb early impression, and also a very lively later printing, so we were able to compare the changes made over time as the publisher endeavored to capitalize on its popularity. This is something it’s almost impossible to do without physical juxtaposition, so we are extremely fortunate that the collections facilitate this kind of close and revealing looking, which is almost always best done in a small group since we all notice differently, and differently again when together,” she said. “A rare and happy opportunity!”\nA new way of seeing\nFrom the very outset of the course, Saunders prioritized honing participants’ visual analysis skills to make close, sustained, and repeated observations of objects, and then articulate those observations. “Although it is a fundamental tool of the academic art historian’s tool kit, developing this kind of attention has applications as an ethical, intellectual, and even spiritual practice that you can take into many other areas of life,” said Saunders, promising “It will change the way you see.”\nHer efforts were clearly impactful. “Professor Saunders places profound emphasis on the meticulous and sustained observation of artworks, providing an invaluable opportunity to truly learn how to ‘see’ artwork by patiently guiding us to look. This approach makes us acutely aware of any preconceived assumptions that might obscure our perception of what is present in the images and objects,” said Wang. “Engaging in essential, precise, and succinct visual analysis has illuminated the gaps and assumptions embedded in my own thought processes.”\n\"Discussion is central to Professor Saunders' classes. She is not necessarily looking for a right answer, and is instead invested in creating a space in which her students can test ideas and theories out.\"\n— Henry Moses '25, A&A major\nExploring the topic through discussion was also central to Saunders’ method. “She encourages us to refine and critically assess our arguments during class discussions,” said Wang. “By posing thought-provoking questions, she illuminates the blind spots in our reasoning, thereby deepening our analytical skills—not only in relation to the artworks themselves but also concerning the arguments we construct. Furthermore, she fosters an open-minded and inclusive environment that embraces a spectrum of theories and interpretative perspectives. She guides us through various readings with insight, enhancing our comprehension of the material from multiple angles.” Moses elaborated, “She is not necessarily looking for a right answer, and is instead invested in creating a space in which her students can test ideas and theories out.”\nDiscussions were fruitful for Saunders, too. “I’ve loved the shared dynamic and rhythm we’ve developed where everyone brings something new to the table at every meeting,” said Saunders. “For me it’s been very energizing!”\nIn spring 2025, Professor Saunders is teaching ART 327 / EAS 327 [Handscroll to Anime: Visual Storytelling in Japanese Art](https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/courses/handscroll-anime-visual-storytelling-japanese-art) and ART 526 / EAS 566 / REL 540 [Arts of Enlightenment: Buddhist Materialities in East Asia](https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/courses/arts-enlightenment-buddhist-materialities-east-asia).",
