  "text": "By Trevor Miller ,\n5 hours ago\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (WTAJ) — Boaters across Pennsylvania now have a more affordable and convenient way to earn their Boating Safety Education Certificate, thanks to a new online course offered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC).\nThe course, developed in partnership with the nonprofit BoatUS Foundation, costs just $17 and meets state and national safety standards. The program is approved by both the PFBC and the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA), and it’s recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard.\nPennsylvania law requires anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 1982, to obtain a certificate to operate boats with motors greater than 25 horsepower or any personal watercraft.\nBill reintroduced to end Sunday hunting ban in PA The course consists of six lessons, quizzes, and a final exam. Accessible on both computers and mobile devices, it can be completed in four to eight hours. Upon passing, participants receive a temporary certificate valid for 60 days, with a durable lifetime card mailed within six weeks.\nPaul Littman, PFBC’s Bureau of Boating director, emphasized the program’s life-saving potential, noting that “approximately 75% of boating fatalities occur on boats where the operator did not have any formal boating safety education.”\nFor more information or to start the course, visit the PFBC website at FishandBoat.com .\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
