  "text": "Crisafulli Government steps in to save Queensland College of Wine Tourism\nThe Crisafulli Government has stepped in to save the Queensland College of Wine Tourism after Labor failed to secure a pathway after a partnership with the University of Southern Queensland concluded.\nThe University advised the former Labor Government of the intent to withdraw from the partnership in October 2023, however, no funds were provided to keep the college open while a new partner could be secured.\nThe College of Wine and Tourism has been operating since 2007 delivers accredited training in Hospitality, Wine Industry Operations and Commercial Cookery, and provides short-course training programs to support skills across the wine tourism industry.\nThe Granite Belt and Southern Burnett wine regions of Queensland heavily rely on the training provided by the College to support skilled workers across vineyards and wineries for the emerging world-class wine regions.\nThe Crisafulli Government will provide support to keep the College operating as it seeks a new operator and works with local industry, business and schools to establish ongoing partnerships.\nThe Queensland Government will open an 'Expression of Interest' process in January 2025, to identify options to add value to the region and community and secure a sustainable funding stream.\nMinister for Finance, Trade, Employment and Training Ros Bates said the Crisafulli Government had taken urgent steps to save the College after Labor left it without a future.\n\"We will keep the College operating while a new operator can be appointed. The jobs of those working at the college will be safe,\" said Minister Bates.\n\"The restaurant and function centre are a critical part of the lifeblood of the community, delivering tourism and hospitality services to Stanthorpe and we will ensure this continues while a future model is determined.\"\nMember for Southern Downes James Lister said Labor had turned its back on the College by failing to act on a way forward or appointing a new operator.\n\"Labor had left the College in a shambles and should be ashamed they have put the future of this region and this industry at risk with their reckless failure,\" said Mr Lister.\n\"Labor knew USQ was walking away from the College and yet they did nothing to secure the future of the College. I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns of our community and for stepping in to save this college.\"\nThe Queensland Government, through the Department of Trade, Employment and Training, will issue an expression of interest to industry and the broader community to identify potential operators of the facility, liaising closely with the Southern Downs Council and community leaders.\nThis announcement represents the ongoing commitment of the Queensland Government to continue to support the community of the Southern Downs, through the best use of the assets at the Queensland College of Wine Tourism.\nThe expression of interest will run alongside a broader community consultation to identify all viable future operating scenarios at the site.\nNew arrangements for the Queensland College of Wine Tourism are expected to be formalised by mid-2025.\n[here](/crisafulli-govt-moves-to-save-qld-wine-tourism-1372649/).",
