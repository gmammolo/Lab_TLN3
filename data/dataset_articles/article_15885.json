  "text": "Bailey Bower is a young man with the world - literally, he hopes - at his feet.\nThe [Farrer](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8774438/robotics-challenge-sparks-creativity-at-farrer-high-school/) student's dream career is to be a diplomat, preferably somewhere in Europe.\n\"You get to travel the world and get to be almost a spokesperson for your country, which would be a cool experience,\" he said.\nThe Year 11 student was speaking with [The Leader](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/) after returning from the NSW Schools Constitutional Convention.\nThe event brought together almost 100 Year 11 students from across the state to engage in discussions about democracy and the Constitution.\nHeld at Parliament House in Sydney, following a tour of the house and talks from the president of the Legislative Council of NSW Ben Franklin, and University of Sydney Professor Emerita of Constitutional Law Anne Twomey, students then participated in a series of workshops and discussions covering different topics.\nFor Bailey, the latter pushed him out of his comfort zone.\n\"It was a bit daunting,\" he said of having to express his opinions in such an open environment.\n\"I like to be sort of quiet and not be very argumentative (his parents might say otherwise, he added).\"\nBe that as it may, his peers must have liked what he had to say.\nAt the end of the day, he was selected as one of the four students to attend the national convention in Canberra in March 2025.\nThe convention will run for three days rather than one, as the state event was. The itinerary includes a visit to Old Parliament House and dinner at the Press Club.\nThey'll also meet with various politicians, including possibly the Prime Minister.\n\"I'm sure I'll probably be way more nervous when I actually get there, but I'm also pretty excited,\" he said.\n\"We get to meet some cool people.\"\nIt promises to be a valuable experience as he looks to pursue a career in the political field.\nNot in the front-and-centre sense, his interest is more in the behind-the-scenes work, particularly the geopolitical area.\nPost-school he hopes to do a double degree in law and international relations.\nThat hasn't, though, always been the plan.\nWhile he's long been fascinated by politics and history, this time last year, he was leaning more towards environmental science.\nBut, after taking legal studies as a subject for Year 11, he found a genuine interest in it.\n\"Even the stuff that was boring, I was really enjoying, so I thought this is something that I really want to lock in a do for a fair while after school,\" he said.\nBailey was joined in Sydney by [Oxley High's ](https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/8826802/oxley-high-2024-year-12-graduates-celebrate-milestone-night/)Emily Wood.\n\"It was a massive opportunity to broaden my horizons and have really informed discussions with like-minded people,\" she said of the experience.\nShe also enjoyed learning more about the Constitution, which isn't covered much in the legal studies syllabus.\nIt was also a good opportunity to \"get more insight\" into the law field.\nLike Bailey, she is hoping to study law when she graduates.",
