  "text": "New York State Department of Health Recognizes December As National Safe Toys and Gifts Month\nTo Ensure a Safe and Happy Holiday Season, Parents and Caregivers are Encouraged to Check That Toys and Gifts are Safe and Age-Appropriate\nALBANY, N.Y. (December 5, 2024) – The New York State Department of Health encourages New Yorkers to check that toys and gifts are safe and age-appropriate this holiday season in recognition of National Safe Toys and Gifts Month in December.\n\"As parents and guardians prepare for the gift giving season, keep safety in mind when shopping for toys for children,\" State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. \"Ensure a toy is age appropriate and avoid giving a toy that is a choking hazard for a young child. Do look for toys that engage young minds in active learning and encourage physical activity and stay away from toys that rely on passively watching a screen.\"\nThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission [Toy-Related Deaths and Injuries report](https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/Toy_Report_2023_Final.pdf?VersionId=T_4d35a2aad8irywEHPUNj.Z9XApZGd7\n) found there were ten deaths and an estimated 154,700 injuries treated in the emergency department in 2022 associated with toys for children aged 12 years and younger. The majority of the ten deaths reported were attributed to choking or asphyxiation associated with small toys, all among children ranging in age from 7 months to 6 years old.\nAmong children who were treated at the emergency department, injuries associated with non-motorized scooters accounted for the largest share of injuries, approximately 53,000, across all age groups. One toy-related death was the result of a crash between a motor vehicle and an unpowered scooter.\nThe Department encourages people to practice the following safety tips when it comes to holiday gift giving for children:\n- Follow age guidance and other safety information on toy packaging and choose toys that match each child's interests and abilities. Most toys have a \"recommended age\" sticker, which should be taken as a starting point in the selection process.\n- Get safety gear, including helmets, for scooters and other riding toys–and make sure that children use them every time. Learn more about bicycle safety\n[here](/prevention/injury_prevention/bicycles.htm). - For children under age 3, avoid small balls and toys with small parts. Toy parts should be bigger than their mouth to avoid the possibility of choking. Ensure that products designed for older children in the home, such as jewelry and cosmetics, are not available to children under 3. Keep deflated balloons away from children younger than age 8. Visit the Department's web page on Choking Prevention for Children,\n[here](/prevention/injury_prevention/choking_prevention_for_children.htm). - Once the gifts are open, immediately discard plastic wrappings or other packaging on toys before they become dangerous.\nAlthough lead from paint is the leading source of lead poisoning in children under 6 years old, toys containing lead are also a source of lead exposure in young children, who are more likely to put toys in their mouth. Even toys that don't contain lead components can pick up dust from household surfaces, which may contain lead. When children put these toys in their mouths, they ingest the lead dust on the toy. Parents and guardians are encouraged to wash their child's toys often to remove any accumulated dust, especially teething toys.\nLearn more about product recalls including toys containing lead [here](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls?combine=lead&field_rc_date%5Bdate%5D=&field_rc_date_1%5Bdate%5D=).\nLearn more about childhood lead poisoning prevention, [here](/environmental/lead/).\nThe Department continues to inform the public about the importance of toy safety through [educational videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQU7KdsvEZg) and social media content.",
