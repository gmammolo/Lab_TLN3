  "text": "Altus Public Schools awarded $1M towards STEM programs\nLAWTON, Okla. (KSWO) - The Department of Defense Education Activity recently awarded a one million dollar grant to Altus Public Schools.\nThe one million dollar grant will fund the STEM to STEAM project, inspired by the need to increase student retention of science and math concepts.\nThe district grant director, Dr. Lana Maldey, says the grant will provide Altus Public Schools with a district Art teacher, steam-related professional development and activities, and art supplies.\nThey applied for the grant in March 2024, and it will now be used. The grant is a five-year award, with the first year being a planning year.\nDr. Maldey says the money will go throughout the district with money allocated to what they need.\nThe main focus will be on after-school programs, increasing electives, professional development, and where they can impact students.\n“We pulled our teachers, what is it that we need, and this was at the highest in that survey, the teachers said that we need more fine arts in our district.” - Maldey stated\nCopyright 2024 KSWO.
