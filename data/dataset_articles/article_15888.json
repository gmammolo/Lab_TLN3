  "text": "The Nigeria Union of Teachers, Oyo State, has commended Governor Seyi Makinde-led government for recruiting 19,500 teachers in five years.\nThe union, in a statement signed by the NUT Chairman, Oladimeji Raji and the Secretary, Salami Olukayode, noted that the appointment of 5,000 teachers in his first term and 14,500 since the inception of his second term into the state primary and secondary schools was noteworthy.\nThe union said the ripple effects of the recruitment were that it would address the problems of inadequate manpower in the education sector and promote teaching and learning.\nThe statement read, “Your disposition towards turning the tide of the education system of Oyo State remains unprecedented and unmatched not only in the annals of recruitment history of our dear state in recent times but also across the entire 36 states of the Federation including the Federal Capital Territory.\n“Your Excellency Sir, your achievements in the education sector since assumption of office particularly, on the successful recruitment of over 14,000 qualified teaching professionals and about 3,500 non- teaching personnel, aside from an appreciative number of caregivers is a clear cut and a perfect reflection of your results-oriented style of leadership aimed at providing free, qualitative and quantitative education to the amiable citizens of Oyo State. This gesture shall, without doubt, have a significant touch in our classroom and as well enhance educational service delivery to our school children.”\nThe union said it was particularly glad that the teachers were recruited on merit.\n“It is no doubt that this noble achievement of yours, despite the prevailing global challenges of economic meltdown, will forever remain a variable tool and special reference point that may not be easily matched by successive administrations.\n“Indeed, you have successfully redeemed our position of honour in the comity of states, most especially on matters of education as envisioned by our beloved forebears. Hence, NUT appreciations of many folds.\n“Kindly be assured of NUT’s undiluted support and unaltered teachers’ dedication to work as expected.\nAhead of next week’s verification exercise of 5,600 newly recruited primary school teachers, the union appealed to the selected individuals to comport themselves to ease the process.",
