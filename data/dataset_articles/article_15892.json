  "text": "ACTC Medical Assisting program announces new partnerships with Valley Health and PrimaryPlus\nPublished on Dec 5, 2024\nKellie Cyrus, Medical Assisting program coordinator at Ashland Community & Technical College, is excited to announce that her program is partnering with Valley Health and PrimaryPlus to offer clinical rotation hours to students in her program.\nThese partnerships will provide students in the Medical Assisting program with valuable hands-on experience, preparing them for success in the healthcare industry.\nWe are excited to partner with ACTC’s Medical Assisting program,” said Brianna Warden HR Generalist for Valley Health. “This collaboration reflects our commitment to supporting aspiring medical professionals and fostering excellence in healthcare education within our community. We look forward to working together to create meaningful opportunities for students and contribute to the future of healthcare.”\nThrough these partnerships, students will be able to complete their clinical rotation hours at both Valley Health and PrimaryPlus facilities, gaining exposure to a wide range of clinical settings and practices.\n“As a Federally Qualified Health Center with a mission to serve and invest in the health of our region, PrimaryPlus believes that also means investing in the workforce,” said Riki Watts, Director of Business and Medical Development for PrimaryPlus.”\nShe added, “PrimaryPlus is thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with ACTC’s Medical Assisting program to encourage and provide firsthand experience in our health centers. We appreciate ACTC for recognizing the need and structuring a strong, comprehensive program that will benefit healthcare employers for years to come.”\nThe addition of these sites will offer students more diverse learning environments and greater access to healthcare professionals, further enriching their educational experience.\nThe Medical Assisting program at ACTC is committed to providing students with high-quality education and practical experience that will prepare them for successful careers in healthcare.\nStudents in the program are required to complete a practicum in their fall semester and an externship the following spring semester. The practicum course is 60 hours of observation, observing 30 hours of administrative duties and 30 hours of clinical duties.\nThe externship is 160 hours, and it is hands-on experience during the students’ last eight-week course. Students complete their externship prepared to enter the working environment.\nBoth courses provide students with the opportunity to observe and participate in day-to-day operations within a doctor's office, gaining firsthand insight into patient care, administrative workflows, and collaborative healthcare delivery.\nBy partnering with leading healthcare providers such as Valley Health and PrimaryPlus, the program continues to strengthen its connections within the medical community and offer students valuable career pathways.\n“These two new partnerships allow our medical assisting students the opportunity to develop practical skills in areas such as patient intake, vital sign monitoring, and basic clinical procedures, all while enhancing their communication and teamwork abilities,” said Cyrus. “This partnership bridges the classroom learning with real-world practice, ensuring our medical assisting student graduates with the confidence and competence to excel in the dynamic healthcare environments.”\nThe Medical Assistant is a vital liaison between the doctor and patient and plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment. The many different roles assumed in this profession ensure a fast-moving and challenging career.\nGraduates go to work in physician offices, clinics, public and private hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient care facilities, medical laboratories or in chiropractic, osteopathic, ophthalmic or other health related offices.\nFor more information about the Medical Assisting program at ACTC, visit [https://ashland.kctcs.edu/education-training/program-finder/medical-assisting.aspx](https://ashland.kctcs.edu/education-training/program-finder/medical-assisting.aspx)",
