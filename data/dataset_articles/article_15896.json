  "text": "CARTERVILLE, Ill. (KFVS) - Some eighth graders in southern Illinois got a hands-on experience to help them choose career paths.\nIt was all part of John A. Logan College’s 8th Grade Career Fair.\nMore than 1,000 other students from 17 schools in southern Illinois attended the event.\n“I learned about the background of a lot of jobs and colleges I can go to. I just think it’s really cool I get to experience this,“ said Sadie Lantagne.\nNow in its third year, the career fair provides an opportunity for students to interact with local businesses and companies, offering them a closer look at potential career paths right here in southern Illinois.\nJALC President, Dr. Kirk Overstreet, said one of the problems they have is SIU students graduating, and then moving out of the area.\n“These jobs are all here. We’ve got everything from lawyers to nurses and dental assistants. We need all those people here. We need people to know they can have a great career here in southern Illinois and make contributions to our economy,” said Dr. Overstreet.\nStudents rotated through more than a dozen local companies in a “musical chairs style” setting, learning about the different careers.\nAs for Sadie’s career goals, she says she’s already got it all figured out.\n“I want to go to SIU or maybe John A. Logan College, so I can go to school to become a pediatrician, and still stay here so I can be close to my family during the holidays,“ said Lantagne.\nJohn A. Logan College says the event has grown significantly each year and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from schools.\nIt also supports the Career Exploration requirement of the State of Illinois' Partnership for Career and College Readiness Framework.\nCopyright 2024 KFVS.
