  "text": "LINCOLN, NEB — Lincoln district reports significant rise in graduation rates, meeting the goal of its strategic plan.\nLincoln Public Schools says graduation rates have risen by more than 3%, from 83.9% in 2023 to 87.6% in 2024.\nThe district says this reflects the goal outlined in its strategic plan of 87% on-time graduation.\nThe district uses different metrics compared to the Nebraska Department of Education, which reported in its recently released data for the 2023-24 school year that LPS has a graduation rate of 85 percent – a three percent increase from the previous school year.\n“We think of our graduation rate goal as really a K through 12 goal. We're talking to students as early as elementary school about the year they're going to graduate from high school, as they go up in their grades in middle school and high school, we're talking about career choices, different opportunities that would be exciting to them to get them passionate about what they want to do next,\" said Sarah Salem, LPS Associate Superintendent for Teaching and Learning.\nSalem attributes the increase Graduation rate to LPS staff and teachers with help prepare students for the next step like taking the ACT or thinking about college.\nWhile the graduation rate has increased, according to Nebraska Department of Education data, the college going rate for LPS during the 2023-24 school year was 73%, down 3% from the previous school year.\nLPS says they have social workers, counselors and other resources in place to help families and student who need assistants.",
