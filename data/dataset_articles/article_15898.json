  "text": "Savitribai Phule Pune University promises students to address UGC’s term limit norm, PRN row\nMahesh Kakde, SPPU’s director of examinations the UGC’s rigid stance on term limit rule limits their intervention into blocking of PRN.\nShubham TiggaPune | December 5, 2024 17:23 IST\nThe Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) administration has informed its law and engineering students whose Permanent Registration Numbers (PRNs) were blocked due to the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) term limit rule that it will attempt to resolve their issues within 15 days.\nThe assurance was reportedly given in writing, with the administration emphasizing that the final decision lies with the UGC. But the university has said that it would also take the initiative to address the grievances.\nThe development follows a sit-in protest staged by a group of students last month, demanding the unblocking of their PRNs to enable them to complete their final-year examinations. The protest, which lasted 12 hours, drew attention to the plight of students who exceeded the maximum term limit of N+2+1 years, as prescribed by the UGC.\nThe protesting students argued that they were unaware of the term validity rule when they re-enrolled after personal and financial setbacks. University officials maintained that the rule was implemented following a 2015 UGC notification and reiterated their inability to override the regulation.\nMahesh Kakde, SPPU’s director of examinations, stated that while the university has supported thousands of students with backlogs, the UGC’s rigid stance on this matter limits their intervention.\nOne engineering student, who enrolled in 2017 but had to discontinue studies for financial reasons after one year, mentioned that many students who took admission in 2017-18 and later discontinued due to various reasons were not informed about the PRN blocking rule when they rejoined college.\n“There are students who enrolled in 2013 and for the next ten years till 2023, their terms continued without blocking their PRN ID. However, such decisions have not only caused mental harassment for students but will also place an additional financial burden on their families,” he said.\n“After receiving their written assurance on November 29, we called off our protest, which had resumed on November 25 after the model code of conduct ended,” he added.\nIn response, Kakde stated that there is no assurance to resolve the issue, as it is beyond the university’s authority. “Only the UGC can take action on this, and we can’t. We can’t do anything that is beyond our control. However, we have assured them in writing that we will try our best to get it done. That’s it,” Kakde said.\nThe written assurance has provided some hope to the affected students, though they continue to await a conclusive resolution from the UGC.\nClick hereto join\nExpress Pune WhatsApp channeland get a curated list of our stories\nTop Stories\nMust Read\nBuzzing Now\n[Dec 05: Latest News](/latest-news/)\n- 01\n- 02\n- 03\n- 04\n- 05",
