  "text": "Missing for two years, Delhi boy is reunited with family — on his 10th birthday\nPolicemen had found the boy, who was mentally challenged, wandering around the Anand Vihar bus terminal last February, unattended. He could neither tell them the names of his parents nor his address. The only thing he could confidently say was his name.\nUpasika SinghalNew Delhi | December 6, 2024 03:43 IST\nFor a 10-year-old boy, staying at a shelter home for nearly two years, his birthday this year was one he would never forget. The reason? He was reunited with his mother, whom he had last seen in February 2023.\nPolicemen had found the boy, who was mentally challenged, wandering around the Anand Vihar bus terminal last February, unattended. He could neither tell them the names of his parents nor his address. The only thing he could confidently say was his name.\nThe policemen ended up dropping him off at a shelter home in Ghaziabad. The boy would stay there for nearly two years before he could go back home to Narela Industrial Area after the police came across a missing person’s complaint while looking into pending cases.\nOn February 17, 2023, the boy’s mother had reported him missing to the police, two days after he disappeared. “I looked for him for two days… My child is mentally challenged… he wouldn’t have been able to find his way back home,” the mother said.\nDCP (Outer North) Nidhin Valsan said, “At that time, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Balraj had completed all the formalities and looked for the child in nearby police stations, bus terminals, railway stations, hospitals and shelter homes… but he could not be found.”\nRecently, when the police revisited unsolved cases, especially those of missing and kidnapped children, this particular case seemed to stick out.\nStation House Officer of Narela Industrial Area police station, Manoj Kumar, reinstated ASI Balraj to the case.\n“We had no CCTV footage from the time he went missing… The last time, we couldn’t find him in any shelter home in Delhi. Almost on a whim, we started looking at shelter homes in Ghaziabad and other nearby areas across the border… We finally found him under the care of a specialised adoption agency in Gharonda,” said an officer.\nWhen the police asked the boy how he managed to come to Ghaziabad on his own, he said that he wanted to travel on a bus. “So, he got on one and came all the way to Anand Vihar. He realised he was in trouble only once he got off the bus and did not know how to go home,” the officer said.\nMeanwhile, after 21 months, the boy’s mother had given up any hope of finding him alive. “I thought someone might have kidnapped him and sold him… sometimes I would think maybe someone killed him and dumped his body somewhere. Eventually, I stopped waiting for any news from the police,” the 30-year-old said.\nSo when the police called her on December 3, asking her to come to Ghaziabad and identify her son, she did not believe them. “I thought it was a cruel joke they were playing on me. I thought my son was dead, so I thought they had found another boy,” she said.\n“She needed a bit of convincing to come to Ghaziabad,” said the officer, chuckling. “But the moment the boy saw her, he immediately ran to her,” he said.\nWhile looking at the Aadhaar card details of the boy and his parents, the police realised that December 3 was also the boy’s 10th birthday. “We got a cake immediately and held a cake-cutting ceremony,” the officer said. Back home, the family celebrated with a lavish dinner.\nThe mother has now set down some stern rules, never to be broken. “He can’t leave my eyesight. I make him stay home and read books. He can play as much as he wants, but only inside the house,” she said.\nTop Stories\nMust Read\nBuzzing Now\n[Dec 05: Latest News](/latest-news/)\n- 01\n- 02\n- 03\n- 04\n- 05",
