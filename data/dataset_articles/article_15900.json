  "text": "OCONOMOWOC — During an Oconomowoc Area School District special board meeting Nov. 20, Katie Marks was appointed to the seat left vacant by John Barnes.\nBarnes had to withdraw from the seat after moving outside of the school district’s boundaries.\nMarks was appointed to the School Board through an application and interview process used when a board seat is vacant mid-term. Marks will serve in her appointed position until the April 2025 election when the seat will be open for election.\nOASD Superintendent Mike Sereno thanked Barnes by saying, \"John has been a thoughtful board member who is supportive and appreciative of the work our students and staff engage in each day. We’re grateful to John for his service to our community and district.\"\nBarnes won the seat in the April 2023 election. With board members serving a three-year term, he would have been up for reelection in 2026. The resignation will put the seat up next year.\nMarks will start attending board meetings in December. \"We’re excited to have Ms. Marks join our School Board and participate in our Finance, Operations, and Advancement Committee. We look forward to her contribution as we continue our work to become an unrivaled school district,\" Sereno said.",
