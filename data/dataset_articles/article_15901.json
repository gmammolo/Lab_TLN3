  "text": "The holiday season offers families a unique chance to create memories that last a lifetime, and North Dakota’s Parents Lead program is here to help parents make the most of this meaningful time. By focusing on connection, gratitude, and resilience, families can enjoy the season together and carry its spirit into the new year.\n“Parenting during the holidays can feel overwhelming, but it’s also a chance to create meaningful traditions and teach children about the values of empathy, hope, and gratitude,” said Sara Kapp, Parents Lead program administrator. “By focusing on what matters most—connection and love—families can make the season brighter and set a strong foundation for the months ahead.”\nSimple ways to create meaningful holiday traditions\n- Set realistic expectations\nHolidays don’t have to be picture-perfect to be memorable. Embrace imperfections and involve children in creating simple traditions that reflect your family’s unique personality. - Start meaningful conversations\nUse the season as a springboard to talk with your children about feelings, gratitude, and togetherness. Conversation starters can include:\n“What can we do to make this year special?”\n“Let’s think of one way we’re lucky this year.”\n“What’s one thing you’re excited about for the new year?”\n- Model calm and gratitude\nChildren pick up on parents’ emotional cues. By staying calm and focusing on gratitude, parents can help their children approach the holidays with positivity and resilience. - Focus on what matters\nShift the focus from material gifts to experiences, kindness, and connection. Bake cookies, volunteer as a family, or take a moment to reflect on the joys of the past year together.\nKeeping the holiday spirit alive year-round\nAs the decorations come down and routines return, keep the spirit of the season alive:\n- Continue family traditions into the new year, like gratitude journals or weekly family check-ins.\n- Support your child’s emotional health by maintaining open communication and being present for their needs.\n- Remember the importance of self-care—parents who take time for themselves are better equipped to care for their families.\nFind free resources to make the season brighter\nParents Lead offers a variety of free resources to help families thrive during the holidays and beyond. Visit [parentslead.org](https://www.parentslead.org/) for:\n- Tips on creating gratitude, empathy, and hope year-round.\n- Activities to build family connections.\n- Support for navigating tough conversations or challenges.\nThis holiday season and throughout the new year, take time to “Look. Listen. Love.” Celebrate your family’s unique journey and enjoy the moments that truly matter.\nAbout Parents Lead\nParents Lead is a North Dakota evidence-based program administered by the state’s Health and Human Services agency. It equips parents and caregivers with tools to support their children’s behavioral health.
