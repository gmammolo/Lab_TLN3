  "text": "Waukesha County Technical College President and CEO Rich Barnhouse’s career aspirations were in flex until he started graduate school.\nAs a graduate assistant Barnhouse got to see the inner workings of a university and felt it was really interesting. Barnhouse wasn’t one to sit on his laurels and continued to seek out his life passion. According to Barnhouse, he is constantly developing as a person and leader.\nIt is higher education where he can see how he and WCTC impacts each student who walks through its doors.\nThe Freeman asked Barnhouse questions about education, leadership and the challenges faced in the industry. Here are his responses.\nThe FREEMAN: What inspired you to go into this field?\nRich Barnhouse: It was by accident. My goal was to get out of school as quickly as possible and never go back. I grew up in a manufacturing family and wanted to get into the workforce as quickly as possible. I finished my undergrad, and at that point I had thought about working in the family business, but I decided to go to grad school. When I was getting my master’s, I was a graduate assistant. In that role, you get to see all the behind-the-scenes inner workings of a university and I remember thinking it was really interesting. I finished my master’s degree and had a job offer with the Detroit Red Wings; I also had a job opportunity at Rice University in Houston. I wanted to work for the Red Wings, but I was really, really interested in higher education and the impact it has on the country.\nFREEMAN: What skills and experience have shaped your career?\nBarnhouse: I think your skills come from your experience. When I was in grad school at Central Michigan University, I had a staff of 20-30 undergrads. I was kind of finding my way in leading and managing. I think I stole leadership traits, leadership style, inflection and tone in my voice, and mannerisms from leaders who I thought were awesome. Most of them didn’t know that I was doing it, but I was watching them: watching how people responded to them — and watching how people didn’t respond to others. Leadership is an ongoing laboratory where you’re constantly watching and trying to figure out how to inspire and influence people toward a goal.\nFREEMAN: Many colleges and universities are struggling. What are the keys to WCTC’s success?\nBarnhouse: Step one is to just make the decision to not be average, and we are not going to be the status quo. Your mission can’t be your goal; your mission is your baseline and you have to shoot above your mission. And you’ve got to be able to take risks. Listen to the businesses, industry and employers. Listen to the taxpayers.\nAnd then do what they’re asking for by using your professional skill, ability and knowledge to pull it off. For us, we’re defying gravity, but it’s not by accident. We’re looking at the horizon: we’re looking as far as we can, and we’re working back from there.\nFREEMAN: What are the challenges?\nBarnhouse: One of the big challenges in higher education is that there was this path for an administrator and playbook for how to run the operations of a college or university — that doesn’t apply today.\nHigher education is having to evolve and adopt more private sector business practices and principles. It’s uncomfortable for higher education in general because it’s a different model. How we balance that, while keeping true to higher education’s mission, is a line that we have to straddle on a daily basis for the health of the institution. It has become a job requirement, which maybe it wasn’t for a college president a decade ago.\nFREEMAN: What is the most rewarding part of being in this type of work?\nBarnhouse: You can actually see lives change. It’s palpable.\nThink about it like this: Education is the only discipline or field that makes all other disciplines or fields possible. It’s a noble pursuit.\nIt’s truly an honor and a privilege to be in a position where you’re leading a college. Seeing the impact at the individual level, when somebody thought that they’d never be able to accomplish something and they do — it’s incredible. And it changes families; it changes communities.\nFREEMAN: Describe yourself as a leader.\nBarnhouse: I would say as a leader, I’m in constant development mode. I’m miles and miles away from the kind of leader I want to be.\nFREEMAN: How do you assess a program to determine if it needs to grow or change?\nBarnhouse: Step one is to listen to employers. Every program at WCTC has an advisory committee composed of business and industry pros who help guide the curriculum. Historically, in education, faculty have relied on a textbook, and that textbook is often out of date by the time it’s published since things change so quickly.\nSure, we teach with textbooks, but these advisory committees help us understand what is changing in the industry in real time. We are talking to the people who are on the floor, in the back office, leading these organizations. We also ask business and industry to tell us when a program is no longer needed. We’ll teach it out so students can finish, then we’ll sunset the program. We’re not going to carry legacy programs that industry doesn’t want; we’re teaching in a very evolutionary and forward-thinking way.\nFREEMAN: What other programs are gaining traction?\nBarnhouse: We will be launching the new Manufacturing Integration Engineering Technology associate degree in fall 2025, and we are exploring more artificial intelligence programs along with automation specialties. Our liberal arts transfer degrees have become increasingly popular since they began in 2023, and our skilled trades programs remain strong.\nWe’ve also seen a marked increase in our dual enrollment numbers as younger, high school-age students are looking to save time and money and get out into the workforce sooner.\nFREEMAN: As higher education continues to evolve, how does WCTC keep the pulse of what future students want?\nBarnhouse: I think, one area where higher education missed the mark for years is that they focused on what they thought 18-year-olds might be interested in — but that doesn’t necessarily correlate with what business and industry want.\nTo create a program that might increase enrollment because it’s interesting but not employable is ineffective — and that’s what most colleges do. The most successful program is the program that leads to a wildly successful career. We have been very intentional in developing programs, listening to our stakeholders and meeting their needs. As an institution of higher learning, it is critical for us to maintain strong connections and listen closely to business and industry and see what their specific need is going to be in two, three or five years.\nFREEMAN: Why have AI programs at WCTC been so successful?\nBarnhouse: The demand from business and industry in Southeastern Wisconsin for AI programming has expanded exponentially.\nIn addition to our strong existing IT programs, such as Data and Analytics, and Cybersecurity, we really partnered with the right people to build the AI curriculum.\nWe designed our AI program (degree and certificates) based on the best technology in the world from Intel, the chipmaker, and then made it applicable to business and industry in Southeastern Wisconsin. We built this from scratch.\nThere are a lot of charlatans out there that take existing IT programs, manipulate the coursework and then call it AI. We developed new coursework that didn’t exist; it’s brand new. That’s what makes us truly a trailblazer.\nFREEMAN: What does the future look like for new programs in this field?\nBarnhouse: The AI (degree) program we have now is just the start. It was first offered in the fall and it was at capacity, so we had to add more sections. This just goes to show how much this is sought after. We’re going to develop more and different AI programs, and we’re also implementing AI throughout the whole institution to help our 1,500 employees become more efficient. In our new Applied AI Lab, we’re helping entrepreneurs and startups create new, groundbreaking AI products — things that don’t exist in the country, and likely, in the world.\nThe innovation that will come out of our lab could change the human experience. The future of AI is going to be transformative; we’re just getting started at WCTC.",
