  "text": "It might look odd now, but one day in the not-too-distant future, you might not blink twice seeing a robot sit among humans in a school line-up.\nAs part of a robotics incursion at Engadine High School, located in Sydney, NSW, students got on the\n[artificial intelligence (AI) ](/story/8258731/)bandwagon and got close to a robot with very lifelike features.\nOver 500 students from 16 high schools across the Sutherland Shire and St George have entered an AI Careers Immersion program this year. The initiative, supported by the Regional Industry Education Partnerships program under the NSW Department of Education, equips young people with the essential skills and knowledge to thrive in a rapidly evolving job market.\nEngadine High School was the first in NSW to welcome G1, a state-of-the-art humanoid robot from Unitree.\nAs companies like BMW increasingly deploy humanoids in manufacturing, students gained hands-on exposure to the cutting edge of AI and robotics.\nThe AI Careers Incursion program prepares students to lead in industries yet to be imagined by fostering lifelong learning and hands-on engagement with transformative technology.\nTrevor Adams from Regional Industry Education Partnerships emphasised the importance of such initiatives. \"In today's fast-changing job landscape, connecting students with\n[emerging technologies](/story/8348201/) and local employers as early as possible is key,\" he said. \"We know this has a massive impact on positive outcomes for students. These experiences empower students to explore future career pathways and develop the agility to adapt to evolving industries.\"\nThe program inspired students to think critically about the impact of AI and robotics on their future.\nVice Captain of Engadine High School, Holly, said: \"I don't think the question is, 'What jobs can we use the humanoid for?' I think the question is, 'What jobs aren't we going to use the humanoids for?' The pace of technology and diversity of jobs remain the challenge.\"\nStudents interacted with robotic dogs and humanoid robots, diving into AI and Mechatronic Engineering.\nTara, a student in the enrichment class, was intrigued. \"I was immediately very excited because the last time robots came to Engadine High with this program, we got to see quadrupeds, and this time it was a bipedal robot, so it was cool to see a humanoid, an advancement that has a lot of unknown potential,\" she said.\nAnother student, Zac, reflected on the robot's future uses. \"I think it will be useful for things that are too dangerous for humans to do or for it to do things humans don't want to,\" he said.\nTo further their learning, students completed AI Microskills through the TAFE Institute of Applied Technology, taking their first steps toward becoming part of a workforce ready to embrace AI-driven opportunities.\nThey also secured opportunities to participate in Cyber Security Work Experience, leveraging their knowledge from the program to explore another critical and rapidly growing field.\nEngadine High School principal Kerrie Jones praised the program. \"Our students and the world they are inheriting are so very different from the world even five years ago,\" she said. We have no idea of the impact of such phenomenal technology. This will also be the next generation's challenge.\"\nSign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.\nWe care about the protection of your data. Read our\n[Privacy Policy](/privacy/).",
