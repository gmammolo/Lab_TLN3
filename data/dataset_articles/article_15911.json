  "text": "Singing Tolstoy's praises\nWar and Peace in a Chinese musical adaptation represents international cooperation, Chen Nan reports.\nIn a remarkable fusion of artistic vision and cultural exchange, the classic Russian literary masterpiece War and Peace is being re-imagined as a Chinese musical.\nThis ambitious project by the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing marks the first time that the famous novel by Leo Tolstoy is given a musical adaptation on the Chinese stage. It will premiere at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre on Dec 20 and runs until Dec 29, vice-president of the national center Zhang Yao, announced during a news conference in Beijing on Nov 20.Leading cast members also appeared at the conference, and gave a performance of Great Comet, a song from the musical.\nA distinguished team of artists, including Russian theater director Alina Chevik, composer Shu Nan, and playwright Yu Rongjun, came together to breathe new life into the epic tale.\n\"We spent two years working on the musical. Our vision was to capture the grandeur of Tolstoy's novel, while translating its complex characters and deep philosophical themes into the vibrant, emotional language of musical theater,\" says Zhang. \"This collaboration between Chinese and Russian artists reflects not only shared artistic goals, but also the spirit of international cooperation that brought this project to fruition.\"\nZhang adds that since its establishment in 2007, the national center has emphasized the diversity of performing arts, achieving remarkable success in the creation of productions, including operas, dances and dramas. War and Peace is the first musical by the institution, and its 112th production overall.\nTolstoy's literary classic is widely regarded as a monumental work of Russian literature. It is set against the backdrop of major historical events in the early 19th-century Russia, and follows the lives of four aristocratic families amid the tumultuous events of war and peace. It has been adapted many times into films, TV series, operas and other art forms, and is loved around the world.\nChevik has worked in the genres of musical theater and operetta for many years. The musical of Anna Karenina, another adaptation of a Tolstoy novel and also directed by Chevik, was staged at the Beijing Performing Arts Centre in October.\nThe director brings her deep emotional connection to this icon of Russian literature into the musical. Having worked closely with the cast, Chevik provided in-depth character analysis and meticulous direction and throughout the creative process collaborated with the composer and playwright to spark the artistic inspiration necessary to present this classic in a modern perspective.\n\"Turning War and Peace into a musical presents a number of unique challenges, primarily due to the complexity of the source material and the requirements of the musical theater format,\" the director says. \"It is a sprawling, multilayered epic, with a vast array of characters, intricate storylines and deep philosophical themes. It spans several years, covering key historical events, and delves into personal journeys, love, betrayal and the meaning of life. Translating this expansive narrative into the concise, emotional storytelling format of a musical is inherently challenging.\"\nShe adds that the creative team worked together to find innovative ways to visually and musically represent the novel's grand scale, from battle scenes to intimate social gatherings, while maintaining the integrity of the original material.",
