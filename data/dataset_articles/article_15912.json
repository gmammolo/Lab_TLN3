  "text": "By Dennis Knight, Savannah Morning News ,\n1 days ago The Early Signing Period for NCAA Football started Wednesday , and there were five players from the Greater Savannah Area who put pen to paper to play for Power 4 programs.\nSavannah Christian had Elijah Griffin sign with Georgia and Logan Brooking sign with Clemson, while Calvary Day's Thomas Blackshear also inked a deal with UGA.\nBenedictine had a big signing ceremony led by Third Scroggins, who signed with Miami and Jacobe Ware, who is headed to Auburn.\nCoach Danny Britt said he got a little choked up reflecting on the careers, and the relationships he has built, with the Cadets dynamic duo.\n\"I was remembering back when they came to our football camps back when they weren't twice my size,\" Britt said. \"I got to spend a lot of time with them and see them grow to where they are now, and it's been special.\n\"We pushed them and demanded a lot from them, and they met that challenge. I love them both and know they will be very successful.\"\nHere's a look at Wednesday's signings in the Greater Savannah area.\nBenedictine Third Scroggins, Miami Scroggins had narrowed his choices to a Final Four of Miami, Auburn, North Carolina and Georgia Tech, before committing to the Hurricanes in June.\nHe closed out his stellar high school career with a dominating senior season as he had 86 tackles, with 17 for losses, while leading the state with 21 sacks for a BC team that reached the state quarterfinals and finished the season with a 7-5 record (statistics through 11 games).\n\"Today means a lot to me and I've been looking forward to it since my visit to Miami, I know it was going to be my home right then,\" said Scroggins, an 'A' student who plans to major in mechanical engineering. \"Playing at Benedictine got me ready for college because we have great coaches like (defensive coordinator) Galen Houston and Danny Britt. And (trainer/coach) DeAngelo Brown also helped me a lot. Now I'm ready to got to Miami. I want to be a freshman All-American and get a lot of sacks to raise my stock up.\"\nJacobe Ward, Auburn Ward was the anchor of the Benedictine offensive line since his sophomore year. The 6-foot-4, 335-pounder had offers from a plethora of the top programs in the country.\nHe narrowed his Top three down to Tennessee, LSU and Auburn before committing to Auburn in July.\nA two-time All-Greater Savannah first-team pick, Ward is known for his strength, skill and competitive fire as a leader on the line and in the locker room for the Cadets.\n\"This is an amazing day for me ― I've always dreamed of playing college football at the highest level and now it's coming true,\" said Ward, who plans to major in Sports Medicine. \"Benedictine has prepared me well because the coaches pushed us so hard. Our summer workouts were a challenge and it tested you physically and mentally. Now my goals at Auburn are to become a freshman All-American and earn All SEC honors. I want to play in the NFL after college.\"\nBenedictine baseball signings Landon Ludwig, Davidson University Luwig was named the Region 3-4A Player of the Year last season. He went 6-1 record with an ERA of 1.02, while fanning 90 batters in 52 1/3 innings. He hit .412 and an OPS of 1.130. He had seven doubles, four triples, two homers, 16 stolen bases and 39 runs with 25 RBI.\n\"Davidson is getting a great player in Landon,\" BC Coach Jason Pascual said. \"He's been an anchor for our team the last three years and we're looking forward to having him lead us this year.\"\nBrooks Bradshaw, Emmanuel University The right-handed pitcher was solid last season and is expected to take on a leadership role in his final season with the Cadets, Pascual said.\nT.J. Windsor, Belmont Abbey College Windsor made the change to become a submarine pitcher and it has paid off. He had a 2.29 ERA last year and is expected to play a big role with the pitching staff this season, Pascual said.\nJack Murphy, St. Vincent College Murphy is a first baseman/DH who is expected to be a key contributor this season. He plays with a lot of heart and is an emotional leader of the team, Pascual said.\nJackson Austin, Gordon State College Austin posted a 2.72 ERA last season and is expected to take on an even bigger role as a leader of the pitching staff this season, Pascual said.\nBenedictine wrestling Zachary Krauss, Belmont Abbey College Cadet Coach Gabe Tvrdy said Krauss is a great example of how desire can lead to success.\n\"Zach is a testament to hard work paying off,\" Tvrdy said. \"He joined the team with zero experience in wrestling but has worked so hard that now he's one of the top wrestlers in the state. He has shown that if there's something you want, you can get it through hard work.\"\nLast year, Krauss won a region title and posted a 50-6 record before an injury ended his season before the state meet.\nSavannah Christian Elijah Griffin, University of Georgia The 5-star was the top ranked defensive lineman in his class and narrowed his choices to Miami, USC and Georgia before committing to the Bulldogs, who gave him his first offer when he was in eighth grade, in October.\nGriffin had another dominating season for the Raiders as he had 53 tackles, including 27 for losses, with 8.5 sacks to earn Region 3A Division I Defensive Player of the Year honors. The two-time All-Greater Savannah Defensive Player of the Year had 301 tackles and 44 sacks in four years as a starter.\n\"It's been a long recruiting process that started when I was in eighth grade,\" said Griffin, a member of the National Honor Society who plans to major in Business Finance. \"But I'm glad I made the decision to play for Georgia, I'm more than satisfied with my choice. What I'm going to remember most about playing for Savannah Christian is just being with my brothers at practice and grinding every day ― especially when we started out in the summers. We had some great teams.\n\"Now I'm looking forward to playing at Georgia,\" he said. \"I'm going to learn the playbook and my goal is to start right away and be a freshman All-American. I'm always going to keep the main thing the main thing and stay focused.\"\nSCPS Coach Baker Woodward said it's been a pleasure to work with Griffin.\n\"Elijah is a kid who does everything the right way, and he does what he says he's going to do,\" Woodward said. \"He said he wanted to be a four-year starter with us, and then play for Georgia in the SEC. He chose Georgia because he thinks it's the best chance for him to develop into an NFL player, and I think it's going to be the perfect fit.\"\nLogan Brooking, Clemson Brooking is headed to Clemson as a tight end, but starred on both sides of the ball for SCPS doubling as a defensive lineman.\nThe son of former Georgia Tech and Atlanta Falcon star Keith Brooking , an assistant coach with the Raiders, earned All-Region first-team honors as a tight end. He had 84 catches for 1,206 yards and six scores in his career and had 189 tackles, including 32.5 for losses and 20.5 sacks in his career at SCPS.\n\"This means everything to me,\" said Brooking, who carries a 4.2 GPA. \"I've been dreaming of playing for an elite college program since I was a little kid ― so today means the world to me. What I'm going to remember the most about playing for Savannah Christian was the camaraderie we had as a team. All the pregame meals we had and just getting to hang out and practice and play with the boys.\"\nBrooking has been true to his commitment to Clemson from the moment he made in November of 2023.\n\"They've devoted a lot of time to me and when I made my commitment, it was at 100%,\" Brooking said. \"I made my decision and that's going to be it. My dad is really old school, and that's how he raised me. My goal is to see the field next year at Clemson and become the best tight end in college football, and if the Lord blesses me I'd like to play in the NFL one day.\"\nWoodward said Brooking is a team-first player not worried about individual accolades.\n\"He's not only one of the best tight ends catching the ball, but he's the most physical blocker I've seen at that position,\" Woodward said. \"I think he's also the best blocking tight end in the state. Clemson saw all of that on film and wanted him, and once Logan visited there he was never deterred. It's a perfect fit for him academically, athletically and culturally.\"\nCalvary Day Thomas Blackshear, University of Georgia The 4-star wide receiver had an impressive senior campaign for the Cavaliers, who reached the Class A-3A Private quarterfinals.\nHe had 47 catches for 1,042 yards and 17 touchdowns and ran for 83 yards and a pair of scores in 10 games.\nBlackshear committed to UGA last May, and in September announced on X that his recruitment was still open. Shortly thereafter, he told Jeff Sentell of Dawgnation.com that he was still solid with his commitment to the Bulldogs.\nIn his final high school game on Friday night, Blackshear had nine catches for 176 yards and three touchdowns, ran for another score and also came in as a defensive back to break up a pair of passes and make four tackles in a 61-39 loss to Prince Avenue Christian.\n\"It meant a lot for me to sign with Georgia,\" Blackshear said. \"To be able to play for your home state school with a program like Georgia is really special, and not many players get a chance to do that. I'm excited about it and I'm looking to get on the field as a freshman and get some playing time and help us win another National Championship.\"\nWalter \"Buddy\" Mathis Jr., LSU The star defensive lineman had his Final Four narrowed down to Auburn, Clemson and LSU before committing to LSU in September.\nThe 6-foot-3, 285-pounder had another big season for the Cavs, who reached the Private School State quarterfinals. He had 49 tackles, including 10.5 for losses, with a pair of sacks. He had 194 tackles, including 57.5 for losses and 17.5 sacks with 59 quarterback hurries in his career.\nSavannah Country Day Andrew Wynn, Tennessee-Chattanooga Wynn is an exceptional athlete who won the Class 3A 300-meter hurdle state title in track and field last May, while finishing second in the 110-meter hurdles. He made the move from cornerback to the defensive line for his senior season and had 35 tackles and four sacks on the year for the Hornets, earning second team All-Region honors.\n\"Andrew embraced the transition and had a great year,\" SCD Coach Roc Batten said. \"He runs so well and comes off the edge with speed ― he knows how to play in space. He's versatile and can use his length to rush the passer, with thee athleticism to drop back into pass coverage. He's also really strong and can bull rush you.\"\nAndrew Nicholson, Bucknell University Nicholson is carrying on the family tradition of earning a college athletic scholarship as his sister, former SCD state Abby Nicholson, plays volleyball at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, where he will be playing for Bucknell.\nNicholson, a 6-foot-6, 290-pound two-way lineman for the Hornets, will be playing offensive tackle at Bucknell.\nHe was an All-Region first-team pick on the offensive line this year and also had 44 tackles on defense.\n\"Andrew is just so athletic for a guy his size,\" Batten said. \"He's one of the best athletes on our team and he's a lineman. He has great feet and excellent arm extension. He plays wit physicality and a lot of skill and is also an 'A' student. Bucknell is getting the full package in Andrew.\"\nNicholson is also a standout basketball player who throws the shot put on the Hornet track and field team.\nTyler Scott, Bryant University Scott, who doubles as a star baseball player for the Hornets, has led the team in tackles from his linebacker position the last two seasons.\nThis year he earned All-Region first-team honors once again as he racked up 142 tackles on the season.\n\"Tyler can do it all,\" Batten said. \"He's a field general who can play inside or outside or up front on the line. He's extremely athletic with unbelievable range. He's got a high football IQ and arrives at the ball violently. He's a hard worker, and a humble and quiet kid who leads by example. Bryant is getting a high character kid and a great player.\"\nRichmond Hill Caleb Easterling, Furman University Easterling was a jack of all trades, and mastered them all in his stellar senior year with the Wildcats.\nHe rushed for 521 yards and eight scores, averaging 13.4 yards per carry and caught 19 passes for 239 yards and two more scores. He added 486 yards in returns and 70 in interception returns for 1,316 all-purpose yards. On defense, he had 26 tackles, with eight passes defended and three picks.\nAn All-Region 1-6A first-team pick as a defensive back, Easterling will be a defensive back and return man at Furman. He also had offers from Charleston Southern, Wofford, Tuskegee and Savannah State.\n\"It was surreal getting the chance to sign today because it's something I've dreamed about since I was about 5 or 6 years old. Furman was the choice for me because of the family atmosphere,\" Easterling said. \"It reminded me a lot of Richmond Hill because everybody knows everybody and I like that kind of culture. Being somewhere that felt like home was really big for me.\"\nCoach Matt LeZotte said he was happy to see Easterling have a big season after being hampered by injuries.\n\"Caleb is such a great all-around player,\" LeZotte said. \"But his biggest attribute is him just being the best teammate, day in and day out. He sets an example in everything he does and his leadership is top notch. I can't say enough great things about the kid, and Furman is getting a great player and a great person.\"\nDennis Knight covers sports for the Savannah Morning News.
