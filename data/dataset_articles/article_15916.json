  "text": "\"Reunion\" exhibit at the Hub-Robeson Center explores survival resilience and hope through art\nAt the HUB-Robeson Galleries, “Reunion,” a multi-level exhibition by Cannupa Hanska Luger, brings together sculpture, fashion and digital media to tell a story of survival, resilience and hope.\nAt the heart of the exhibit is the bison – a symbol of freedom, sustenance and survival for various Indigenous cultures.\nRobert Sparrow Jones is the curator and senior gallery manager at the HUB-Robeson Galleries. He said that bison serve as a central symbol in Cannupa Hanska Luger’s “Reunion” exhibit.\n“I think that Cannupa is using bison as a symbol of freedom for many Indigenous cultures. For him, I think they represent sustenance and survival. They have an agency and a real immersive power, and so I think there’s a profound history to be learned.”\nPhoenix Jenkins is a second-year student and gallery assistant. She said it’s important for people to understand Cannupa both as an artist and a person.\n“He is from the Standing Rock reservation, and he’s done a lot of work, specifically during the Pipeline Protests that happened a couple of years back. He’s a great artist, and he’s just a great person in general.”\nThe exhibition doesn’t just celebrate the bison – it mourns the near loss of this species while envisioning a future built on gratitude and kinship. Cannupa Hanska Luger describes the work as a reflection on the complexity of survival and the possibilities of a sustainable future.\nWith pieces like “Blood In The Soil” and “(Be)Longing,” visitors are encouraged to reflect on the interconnectedness of humans, nature and the past.\n“Reunion” is open now at the HUB-Robeson Galleries, offering visitors a powerful opportunity to engage with history and reimagine the future.\nGavin Rollman is a fourth-year majoring in broadcast journalism.
