  "text": "20% Alternative Pathways Pledge to address digital skills shortage\nThe pledge commits organisations to ensuring 20 per cent of their entry-level digital hires come from alternative educational pathways.\n06 December 2024\nMajor digital industry leaders have joined forces to sign a landmark initiative that aims to tackle the state’s projected digital skills shortfall by 2030.\nThe 20% Alternative Pathways Pledge, signed by partners of the NSW Digital Skills and Workforce Compact, commits organisations to ensuring that 20 per cent of their entry-level digital hires come from alternative educational pathways.\nAs part of the NSW Digital Compact, this initiative represents a collaborative effort between government, education providers, and the digital industry to address the anticipated shortfall of 85,000 digital workers across NSW by 2030.\nAlternative pathways, such as vocational education and training (VET) courses, traineeships, micro-credentials, bootcamps, earn-while-you-learn models, and vendor certifications, offer accessible and practical routes into the digital workforce beyond traditional university education.\nThe pledge is designed to enhance equity and diversity within the digital sector. By 2030, it is expected to:\n- Add 31,000 workers from diverse backgrounds\n- Increase the proportion of women in tech roles by seven per cent\n- Double the representation of First Nations Australians in tech roles\n- Boost the share of people with disabilities in tech roles by four per cent\nThe commitment also strengthens the role of VET as a critical pathway into the digital sector, helping to address ongoing skills shortages and raising its profile within the industry.\nThe pledge reflects a collective commitment from leading organisations such as Microsoft, Commonwealth Bank, and Accenture Australia. These signatories demonstrate the effectiveness of collaborative action in addressing workforce challenges and creating a more inclusive and competitive digital economy.\nThis initiative supports the state’s strategic efforts to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, while also opening doors for individuals from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in the growing digital sector.\nFor further details about the pledge and the NSW Digital Compact, visit [https://www.nsw.gov.au/education-and-training/nsw-digital-compact/20-per-cent-alternative-pathways-pledge](https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu26892420.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.czRgix5dsuISVD4k7s4OueBzKk-2BCw0mMz1NYfs14-2BKj2wzE0SpDsFM17P1f0T2F6j1VuFQLqMfi-2Blg-2BQv-2FO0zOYDgVbOSWmIF6p5aA-2BctiTO9CIZdG-2Bx74gez0FskvcTCBmWH-2FOPpYPbSI5DWQn9RbBdXg0HNb3QrWFWNsNL5VA-3D9pHD_UnYBLMG-2F4Eb-2F1AW2n9kLEUAQgnC3zSVSBc6x0Sbo0-2FytEP1XLE96kaKuXSnaUFwl9AO7iH8ONXqo5A9QWiKUHt6ZhZZItI-2B-2F6E8Ce1z5htYXTtVywBomNWSym6Rm2C3ls7x8nYWbaIrlH-2FIqAuvm90536Ocbuo2B8t9tJMlHWtjGq4gE-2BZYcqhTbJw-2FYTv90BvKc0wZTkGzetCbse5mhJ979U6dyYNtnUxtHtdnkw-2BmeGWk7DAVWV1m4fDw6OcHhmg6Dy9urwnzMd1av05FOFXpaVstKKCPuohGZY59enmoxoPRRLjA38gkPiXsiWYQ-2BlkAFwqjry-2BMr9Jcwt0dTYM8Zun8hFAKQQmY88YMux8g-3D&data=05%7C02%7CLuke.Horton14%40det.nsw.edu.au%7Ce97526cab208440991ab08dd14be3336%7C05a0e69a418a47c19c259387261bf991%7C0%7C0%7C638689529333842408%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=GD0i0JOMVVmnaiKrA0iJBG0tX9aX5pNnVJPN8xDIsdk%3D&reserved=0)\nThe following key industry leaders have signed on to the Alternative Pathways Pledge:\n- Accenture, ACFIPS, Australian Computer Society, AIIA, Akkodis, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank Australia, Community Colleges Australia, Department of Education, FDM Group Australia, Future Skills Organisation, Generation Australia, Institute of Technology - Digital, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Premier’s Department, Revenue NSW, ServiceNow, TAFE NSW, Tech Council Australia, Transport for NSW.\nNSW Department of Education Deputy Secretary, Education and Skills Reform, Chloe Read said:\n\"The 20% Alternative Pathways Pledge will play a crucial role in helping NSW meet its projected shortfall of 85,000 digital workers by 2030.\n\"By prioritising equity and diversity, this initiative is not just about filling roles, it’s about building a workforce that harnesses the full potential of NSW’s talent.\n“Increasing representation of women, First Nations Australians and people with disabilities in tech will strengthen the sector and enrich our communities.\"\nChair of the NSW Skills Board and CEO of Microsoft ANZ, Steven Worrall, said:\n“The 20% Alternative Pathways Pledge offers a significant opportunity for us to collectively strengthen the digital workforce while promoting diversity and inclusion.\n“I am proud that the digital industry, NSW Government and national peak bodies are collaborating around such an important cultural change.\n“This commitment is unique opportunity to set the standard for inclusive hiring practices, showing leadership across the private and public sectors. The 20% Alternative Pathways Pledge will open the doors to new talent, providing meaningful careers in digital for underrepresented groups.”\nCEO of the Tech Council of Australia, Damian Kassabgi, said:\n“Alternative pathways, such as vocational training, vendor courses, and earn-while-you-learn models, play a vital role in building our tech workforce pipeline.\n“By opening doors to individuals from varied backgrounds and experiences, we ensure our workforce better reflects the broader community it serves.\n“We believe the Pledge will play a significant role in the development of innovation and growth in our sector, helping to secure Australia's digital future.”\n- News",
