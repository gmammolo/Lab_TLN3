  "text": "SLT-Mobitel Nebula Institute of Technology, the educational arm of SLT-Mobitel, hosted its annual graduation ceremony on 8 November 2024. The prestigious event took place in the main auditorium of the BMICH, Colombo. Celebrating the achievements of its latest cohort of graduates, the graduation ceremony paved pathways for their future success and aspirations. The convocation was the first graduation ceremony held since the brand’s relaunch setting a significant milestone for the Institute.\nThe Guest of Honour at the Graduation was University of Hertfordshire, UK Dean of the School of Physics, Engineering and Computer Science Prof. Daniel McCluskey, who delivered a thought-provoking keynote address.\nThe ceremony marked a significant milestone for students who successfully completed various globally recognised engineering and ICT related specialist programs offered by the Institute, including the BEng (Hons) Degree program conferred by the University of Hertfordshire, UK, as well as the BTEC Higher National Diploma (HND) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the BTEC Higher National Diploma (HND) in Digital Technologies awarded by Pearson, UK. This year’s event further demonstrated the Institute’s pledge to nurture the next generation of tech talent in Sri Lanka.\nThe graduation ceremony included 159 graduates of which 23 were employees of SLT-Mobitel with dreams of scaling new careers. The event also served as a testament to SLT-Mobitel’s commitment to supporting the development of Sri Lanka’s ICT sector, with a specific focus on helping prospective students pursue careers in engineering and ICT specialisations. As the country strives to position itself as a technological hub in the region, the role of institutions such as SLT-Mobitel Nebula Institute of Technology becomes increasingly crucial in shaping the industry’s future.\nCelebrating academic excellence, three students were honoured for their achievements. Habarakadage Janaka Chathuranga Abeywardena received the Best Student Award for outstanding performance in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering program from the University of Hertfordshire, UK. In the Pearson BTEC qualifications, Hetti Arachige Dileesha Shenal Ashinsa Perera earned the Gold Medal for Best Academic Performance in Level 5 Higher National Diploma in Engineering (Electrical and Electronic Engineering), and Udawala Hewayalage Iresha Dilrukshi De Silva secured the Gold Medal for Best Academic Performance in Level 5 Higher National Diploma in Digital Technologies.\nThe event was broadcast through live coverage on PEO TV Channel 20. It was also streamed on YouTube and Facebook Live, enabling a wider audience to participate in the event. The graduation ceremony was a celebration of the students and their achievements. Furthermore, it highlighted the calibre of the Nebula Institute’s education and their role in helping students achieve their engineering dreams and future success.\nProspective students and parents interested in learning more about the Nebula Institute of Technology’s programs are encouraged to visit www.nebula.edu.lk, email [email protected] or call 0112956633 and discover their potential.",
