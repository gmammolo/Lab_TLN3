  "text": "Inaugural batch of students at Cinnamon Hospitality Academy\nPanel discussion in progress at the launch event\nBy Janani Kandaramage\nCinnamon Hospitality Academy, a pioneering initiative by Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts in partnership with the Swiss Hotel Management (SHMA), officially commenced operations post welcoming its inaugural batch of 43 students on 3 December.\nThis strategic partnership aims to elevate hospitality education in Sri Lanka via the introduction of the internationally renowned Vocational Education and Training (VET) by Ecolehoteliere de Lausanne (EHL) professional diploma program. Ranked as the world’s number one institute for hospitality management, EHL offers unparalleled expertise to this collaborative initiative, ensuring that students receive a globally acclaimed qualification rooted in Swiss hospitality excellence.\nThe curriculum pursued at Cinnamon Hospitality Academy is based on the Swiss Gold Standards Framework, offering three specialised pathways: culinary, food and beverage services, and hotel management. The VET program by EHL adopts an apprenticeship based ‘Learn, Work, and Earn’ model, merging two days of theoretical and practical learning with 4 days of hands-on training at the Cinamon Hotels and Resorts Colombo hotels. The 18 month professional diploma, combined with one year of work experience equips students to meet global standards in hospitality.\nIn her welcome address, Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Human Resources Senior Vice President Ishara Naufal labelled the event a momentous occasion in showcasing Cinnamon’s commitment to nurturing talent. She said: “This collaboration embodies a shared vision to elevate the standard of hospitality education in Sri Lanka. This well-structured curriculum and high-quality training facilitated by SHMA and EHL-certified faculty members will ensure that students graduate with the skills, mind-set, and knowledge required to excel in the global hospitality landscape. Today, we celebrate the first step in creating a skilled workforce that will redefine the future of Sri Lankan tourism.”\nShe also emphasised that this pivotal step steers Sri Lanka toward becoming an acclaimed tourism hub, through local talent utilisation and skill development of staff that will enhance guest experiences. In addition, she believes that advancing local hospitality is crucial to boosting the local economy through greater job creation and export revenue generation as a result of high-value tourism.\nCinnamon Hotels and Resorts COO and Deputy CEO Hishan Singhawansa remarked: “The inauguration of the Cinnamon Hospitality Academy is a proud moment for us as we lead the way in developing the next generation of hospitality professionals in Sri Lanka. By collaborating with SHMA, delivering the VET by EHL Professional Diploma will be an unmatched educational experience that combines global standards with real-world practical training. This move will not only set new benchmarks in the industry but will also strengthen our position as an employer of choice in the region.” Describing Sri Lanka’s progress in tourism over the years, Singhawansa further stated, “It took 3 years to make this hard work a possibility. Despite a series of consecutive crises, we hope to conclude 2024 with 2 million tourist arrivals, the highest since 2018. This steady return to normalcy in combination with Sri Lanka’s rather stable macroeconomic situation are signs of growth that must be harnessed if it is to become a top tourist destination like Bali. Bali experiences 6 million tourist arrivals annually, on average, and this is something definitely within the realm of possibility in Sri Lanka.\nHe stressed that the development of human capital within the service sector of the nation should be at the forefront of the national industry, given that skill shortages are limiting the growth of Sri Lankan tourism. “Sri Lankans naturally have a warm, generous and hospitable disposition. Harnessed with the right technical expertise and competence, the hospitable industry can be greatly improved.”\nOutlining the process of implementing VET in Sri Lanka, SHMA Director Rolf Blaser said: “As a result of the severe shortage of know-how in the hotel management industry, we tried to track down many universities willing to offer the best course content. This led us to EHL, which allowed us to adopt their apprenticeship model and provided us with teachers who are EHL certified.” He asserted that students will not only learn, but will be able to earn and grow during the diploma due to the endless internship opportunities available. “This apprenticeship model is incorporated in around 260 different education fields and is quite common in Switzerland, however, we are the first to embed this model into the hospitality field. We are pleased to receive inquiries from diplomatic circles urging to send students to Sri Lanka, and that makes us very proud. Many regions elsewhere in Asia are also expressing desire in incorporating this model. All these factors demonstrate this program’s global recognition, implying it is of the best of standards. Therefore, we aim to use this model to be the best for Sri Lanka, not necessarily the best in Sri Lanka.”\nEHL Vocational Education and Training Head Jens-Henning Peters added, “The VET by EHL program is not just about education but it is about combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience, in a real world setting. With the help of the Cinnamon Hospitality Academy, we will be providing students with the skills they need to thrive in today’s dynamic hospitality sector. This partnership focuses on meeting the workforce needs of Cinnamon hotels, while ensuring our students receive top-notch training. As we look ahead, our goal is to expand this program to accommodate 200 students by 2025. Together we will not only be shaping careers, but also contributing to the growth of this sector in Sri Lanka.” Praising this collaborative effort, Ambassador of Switzerland to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Siri Walt highlighted the untapped potential of the Sri Lankan hospitality sector which must be leveraged. She compared Sri Lanka to Switzerland, noting that 2/3 of Swiss chose this path, establishing it as one of the popular fields alongside healthcare and IT. She believes that Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector can be easily leveraged through training focused on professional competence and innovation, as the Swiss Gold Standard Framework in this program advocates for.\nBringing premium education to Sri Lanka from the ‘Home of Hospitality’ and encompassing the finesse and continental tradition of Swiss hospitality, SHMA brings world-class professional vocational education and practical training replicating real-life situations on a ‘Learn and Apply’ model for students to thrive in the hospitality industry. SHMA is partnered by the World’s No.1 Hospitality Management School Ecolehotilere de Lausanne (EHL) in Switzerland, a pioneer and ambassador of Swiss hospitality via the launch of the VET programs in the country.\nThe VET by EHL program, is a Swiss license model by EHL Group. Delivered through a global network of leading training partners in over 25 locations around the world, it shares benchmark vocational competencies and knowledge needed for successful careers in the hospitality industry. Graduates are sought after, as they are trained as service-minded, effective hospitality professionals with strong critical thinking and ready to implement new trends. Using a first-in-class hybrid learning approach with a focus on practical learning, VET by EHL gives learners the opportunity to study in culinary, service and rooms, from single courses to full diploma.",
