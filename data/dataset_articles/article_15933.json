  "text": "Lorain Mayor Jack Bradley honored members of the Lorain City Schools staff and staff of Palm Elementary School during a proclamation ceremony Dec. 3 at City Hall, according to a news release issued by Christa Lokiec, director of communications and community relations at Lorain City Schools.\n“The event was organized by Angela Camille, a radiant individual known for spreading positivity and illuminating the spaces and lives around her,” Lokiec said. “Her heartfelt request highlighted the honorees’ hard work, dedication and significant contributions to education, the district and its students.”\nThe individual proclamations were presented to: Timothy Jama, an administrator at Lorain High School; Rosemary Benson, a retired teacher;\nBrian Pagan, a teacher at General Johnnie Wilson Middle School; Jay Ferguson, a Board of Education member, who also is a retired teacher and administrator; and Cassandra Robinson, retired store director at Meijer in Lorain, who is a longtime supporter of Lorain Schools.\nThe ceremony was well-attended, with an audience comprised of colleagues and family members of those being recognized, Lokiec said.\nDuring the event, Bradley personally presented proclamations to each recipient, “taking time to say something special to each person as he gave out the awards,” Lokiec said.\n“I find that it is absolutely paramount and important to give thanks to those that have really gone above and beyond,” Camille said. “One thing that everyone on the requests have in common, is their passion for helping students and making a positive impact in education.”\nThe ceremony was a meaningful recognition of the educational professionals’ efforts and achievements, celebrating their important work in supporting students and the community, Lokiec said.",
