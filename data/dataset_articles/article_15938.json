  "text": "The team has maintained a 3.5 GPA during postseason action.\nMARSHVILLE, N.C. — The Forest Hills High School Yellow Jackets are redefining success, proving that excellence extends far beyond the football field.\nAs the team prepares for the fourth round of playoffs against Brevard, head coach Jammie Deese is emphasizing a holistic approach to student achievement.\n“We’ve always talked about it’s a marathon, not a sprint,” Deese said.\nAcademic Excellence The team’s commitment to academics is remarkable. With more than 20 students boasting GPAs over 4.0 and a team average of 3.5, these student-athletes are challenging traditional narratives about high school sports.\n“Our mindset as a team is more important than our play calls,” Braxton Grace, the team’s center, said.\nA pre-med hopeful, he sees his future success as a combination of service and dedication.\nCoach Deese has cultivated a culture of accountability and personal growth. Players like running back Rodney Smith view the coach as more than just a sports mentor.\n“He’s been a good role model for me,” Smith said.\nPlayoff Prospects With their upcoming match against Brevard, the Yellow Jackets are poised to continue their winning streak, carrying the same determination they apply to their studies.\nThe team demonstrates that true champions are defined not just by scores, but by character, academic dedication, and a commitment to personal growth.\nFor the latest breaking news, weather and traffic alerts that impact you from WCNC Charlotte, download the WCNC Charlotte mobile app and enable push notifications.\nYou can stream WCNC Charlotte on Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, just download the free app to get the news that impacts you.",
