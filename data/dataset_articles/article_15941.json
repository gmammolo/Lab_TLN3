  "text": "Teaching your young kids to ski can feel daunting. Heck, getting young kids to the mountain, dressed properly , and clicked into their skis can be daunting, let alone teaching them to ski. We’re here to help.\nBut first things first: How do you know your kiddo is ready? We asked Brian and Aleks Smith, PSIA instructors at Aspen Snowmass and parents of two daughters. The Smiths work with the youngest sliders all winter, and what’s more, they went through the process of introducing the sport to their own girls not too long ago. In other words, the instructor pair is a wealth of information when it comes to the how and when to get the groms sliding.\n Related: Renting vs. Buying Kids Ski Gear\nMost kids are ready to hit the slopes between the ages of 3 and 4, says Aleks Smith, but some 2-year-olds may already be interested and able. One thing to look for is the ability to balance, says Smith, e.g., riding a pushbike or playing soccer or other sports. The other thing is interest: Do they want to try skiing?\nOnce you’ve determined that your child is ready, one option Smith recommends is using props. “Many parents choose to use tools to aid in their children’s skill development,” Smith says. “If used properly, these tools can be useful.” The props Smith reaches for most often are the harness, the Edgie Wedgie, and the Hula Hoop. Here, Smith walks us through how to use each prop safely and successfully.\nWatch: See How to Use These Tools to Teach Your Young Kids to Ski\nProp: Hula Hoop She looks like a pro! ( Photo courtesy of Bailey LaRue) Age : 2-3 Indication : Child is struggling to maintain balance while sliding $14 at Amazon\nThe idea here is to teach young kids to stand independently while sliding forward and resist the urge to lean back. Slip the hoop around the child’s waist and hold onto the back of it. You’re in control, while the child feels the sensation of sliding.\nNo longer needed : When the child isn’t leaning against the front of the hoop Prop: Edgie Wedgie Age : 2-5 Indication : Child is having trouble keeping his tips together $11.90 at Amazon\nThis simple device can help you avoid major on-slope meltdowns. (Photo: Courtesy of Edgie Wedgie) Making a wedge can be difficult for kids five and under, as they often don’t have the leg strength to hold their skis in that position. That’s where the Edgie Wedgie comes in. This device easily attaches and detaches to the tips of the child’s skis. Ashe stretches the Edgie Wedgie, his skis will naturally form a wedge; the bigger the stretch, the wider the wedge. Once the child understands the shape and knows what it feels like to arrange his skis just so, he should be able to start to wedge without the Edgie Wedgie.\nNo longer needed : When the child isn’t stretching it while turning or stopping Prop: Harness The harness is great for giving kids—and parents—a little extra confidence, especially on crowded slopes. (Photo: Courtesy of Lucky Bums) Age : 2-6 Indication : Child can’t stop on her own or is nervous $33.40 at Amazon\nA harness is a great tool for very young kids who haven’t figured out the wedge stop. It can be tricky to put on properly, so be sure to read the directions. The idea is to keep your little skier in front of you as you descend very gentle terrain, holding the straps with some slack. Don’t ever tug on the straps, or you can throw the child off balance.\nNo longer needed : When the child can stop on her own",
