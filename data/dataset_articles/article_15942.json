  "text": "Education Secretary Juan Edgardo Angara, along with other Department of Education (DepEd) officials and stakeholders, visited typhoon-stricken schools in Camarines Sur to turn over essential learning, teaching, and digital materials.\nGainza Central School received UNICEF donations that included teaching packs, student kits, classroom materials, and digital tools to aid in learning recovery. On the other hand, Bula Central School, meanwhile, received learning packs and whiteboards from USAID&#39;s Advancing Basic Education in the Philippines (ABC+) Project.\nAngara thanked the UNICEF and USAID for their assistance in reinforcing DepEd’s learning recovery efforts.\nAngara also monitored the situation of Minalabac National High School which was heavily damaged by flood. He also visited Rodriguez National High School where he checked on the school’s unique digital classroom equipped with computers and internet access, used for coding lessons by senior high students.\nDuring his Bicol tour, Angara also inaugurated Camarines Sur’s first learning and development center for teachers, the Academy of Inclusive Learning and Development (iLEAD). The facility offers training programs for professional growth, allowing educators to customize their learning paths.\n“For us at DepEd, this is just an initial visit. Rest assured that more actions will follow. You can count on us to continue advocating for quality education for every child,” Angara told the teachers.\nAccompanying the Secretary were Camarines Sur 2nd District Rep. LRay Villafuerte, Gov. Luigi Villafuerte, and other DepEd officials from the central and regional offices.",
