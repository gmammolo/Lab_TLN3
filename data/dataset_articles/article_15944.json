  "text": "Arellano University received the biggest financial assistance in the volleyball program of organizers of the recent 2024 Shakey’s Super League Pre-Season Championship.\nThe school received a check of P1.759 million from the organizers, who raised a total of ₱13,936,050 from donations during the tournament.\n“It’s a great help. We cannot deny na hulog ng langit iyan,” said Arellano University sports director Peter Cayco after receiving the check from Shakey’s Pizza Ventures General Manager Oliver Sicam during a ceremony on Wednesday afternoon in Malate.\nThe total amount was raised through the pizza chain’s promotion of the Shakey’s Super League Bundle. The rest of the funds were distributed to the 18 participating schools, which are preparing for the coming National Collegiate Athletic Association and University Athletic Association of the Philippines seasons.\nCayco said that while the majority of the funds will be for their volleyball program and the needs of their athletes, they will also allocate some funds to other sports disciplines.\nJose Rizal University received P902,008 in funding, while the College of St. Benilde and Letran got P896,758, and P855,908 respectively.\nThe Sherwin Meneses-coached National University, which beat La Salle in a 23-25, 25-18, 25-16, 25-20 Game 2 victory, won a third straight Shakey’s Super League Collegiate Pre-season Championship title last November 24 at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.\nThe Lady Bulldogs drew strength from the pair of Alyssa Solomon and Bella Belen, who were also around last year.\nNU made it to the finals after getting past the Far Eastern University Lady Tamaraws in the semifinals.",
