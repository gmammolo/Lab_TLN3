  "text": "The Getty Foundation and the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund are advancing efforts to preserve Black modernist architecture, awarding $1.55 million in a new funding round.\nAmong the recipients is Morehouse College, which will receive $150,000 to support preservation planning for three historic residence halls designed by Atlanta’s Leon Allain, a prominent Black architect, in the 1970s.\nThe funding will facilitate building assessments and a historic structures report for the sites—the Claude B. Dansby, Benjamin G. Brawley, and John H. Wheeler residence halls, which have earned historical designation.\nGetty’s latest investment will enable the action fund to support preservation planning, training, and storytelling for seven other grantees in 2025.\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation launched the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund in 2017 and has since raised $140 million to protect and preserve Black historic sites across America.\n“African American architects and designers have been left out of the modern architecture movement for over a century. Because of this, many pioneers of the Black modernism movement remain unknown, despite the incredible work they have done to fuel innovation, experimentation and push the limits of how people interact with the built environment,” Brent Leggs, Executive Director of the Action Fund and senior vice president of the National Trust said in a statement. “With the support of the Getty Foundation, the Action Fund will continue to leverage historic preservation as a force that ensures the contributions of Black people and culture are protected and included in the narrative of our nation’s heritage.”\n“By extending Conserving Black Modernism, we get closer to our shared goal of expanding the story of mid-century architecture to include the advances and innovations of African America architects,” Joan Weinstein, Director of the Getty Foundation, said in a statement. “Important buildings continue to be threatened, and a third year of Conserving Black Modernism will deliver much needed project support and critical training in communities across the country to ensure a robust network of professionals are in place to care for this heritage into the future.”\nApplications for the Conserving Black Modernism program are managed by the action fund and will be accepted beginning Jan. 10. Grantees will be announced in July.",
