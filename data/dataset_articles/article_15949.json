  "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — The United States Senate this week approved legislation to explore the integration of the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia into the Smithsonian Institution . The legislation, spearheaded by Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and Representative Brendan Boyle (D-PA-2), marks a significant step toward ensuring the longevity and expanded reach of the museum, which is dedicated to preserving and celebrating the American Jewish experience. The bill now awaits the President’s signature.\nCurrently located on Independence Mall in historic Old City Philadelphia, the Weitzman Museum is the only institution in the United States solely focused on the history, culture, and contributions of Jewish Americans. Covering over three centuries of Jewish life in the country, the museum houses a collection of more than 30,000 artifacts that explore themes of immigration, faith, labor, community, and family. Since its opening in 1976, the museum has sought to educate and inspire visitors about the enduring legacy of Jewish-Americans in shaping the nation.\n“With antisemitism on the rise, the Weitzman Museum is playing a vital role in educating the next generation about the contributions Jewish Americans have made to our Nation and stemming the tide of hate,” said Senator Casey, underscoring the importance of preserving the museum’s impact. “Integrating the Weitzman with the Smithsonian will cement the museum’s place as one of America’s essential institutions.”\nThe legislation, named the Commission to Study the Potential Transfer of the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History to the Smithsonian Institution Act, establishes a special commission tasked with evaluating the feasibility and implications of such a transfer. The eight-member commission will be composed of bipartisan appointments from Congress and will prepare a detailed report for legislative consideration.\nRepresentative Boyle emphasized the significance of this development, stating, “This critical bill marks an important step toward the Weitzman Museum becoming part of the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution. As the only museum in the nation dedicated exclusively to exploring and interpreting the American Jewish experience, the Weitzman plays a vital role in preserving and sharing a key chapter of our nation’s history. Integrating the museum into the Smithsonian family would not only expand its reach and resources but also ensure its continued ability to educate and inspire future generations about the rich culture and contributions of American Jews.”\nThe commission’s responsibilities will include assessing the museum’s educational impact, particularly in addressing modern antisemitism, as well as reviewing the museum’s collections, financial structures, governance model, and the costs associated with its operation. Additionally, the report will evaluate what integration with the Smithsonian would mean for both parties. Notably, the commission will rely on private contributions to fund its activities, reflecting its commitment to achieving its goals without federal financial support.\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL-25), who led companion legislation in the House that passed earlier this year, also played a key role in advancing this bipartisan effort. The initiative highlights a growing recognition within Congress of the need to counter antisemitism through education and broader public awareness.\nThe Weitzman Museum represents a crucial resource for understanding the historical and cultural contributions of Jewish Americans from the 17th century to the present. Located steps away from other landmarks such as the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, its presence on Philadelphia’s iconic Independence Mall serves as a reminder of the values of inclusion and unity that have shaped the nation. Once integrated into the Smithsonian Institution, the museum would have enhanced opportunities to expand its audience, resources, and programming, furthering its mission to foster tolerance and awareness.\nShould the President sign the legislation into law and the commission recommend the museum’s transfer, it would become the Smithsonian’s first museum wholly dedicated to the Jewish-American experience, adding to the institution’s diverse catalog of representations of U.S. history and culture. This development could provide greater visibility and support for the museum as it continues its crucial work in preserving this important narrative for future generations.\nThe Senate’s action represents a pivotal step toward strengthening the museum’s role in combating prejudice, promoting understanding, and highlighting the enduring contributions of Jewish Americans to the nation’s fabric.",
