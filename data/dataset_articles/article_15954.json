  "text": "The Jodee Redmond Memorial Award was created in 2020 to honour the life of much-respected community nurse Jodee-Anne Genevieve Redmond Wager. Her husband, Paul Redmond-Wager, attended the ceremony to present the award to Cerise.\n“Our motivation for this award was not to reward the most highly academically successful student, but the student who deserved to be acknowledged and is truly motivated to continue. Above all else, empathy is essential in nursing. Having been a long-term patient myself, the value of empathy is hard to explain, but it is invaluable in my own experience and Cerise shows that in many ways.”\nSenior Lecturer Jenny Green, who taught Cerise, describes her as someone whose personality and empathy shines through in every interaction.\n“Cerise is a dedicated student; she has willingly swapped placements to accommodate the needs of other students. In a previous placement, she met challenges, but with the assistance of her Clinical Teacher Assistant, she acknowledged how much she had learned and how valuable she was to the team.”\nA mother, mentor, and advocate, Cerise transitioned to nursing after 14 years of working in the mental health sector in a secure facility for women. There, she led efforts to empower residents, teaching life skills and reintroducing them to community living. Despite the challenges, Cerise often went above and beyond, advocating for her clients and implementing positive changes in their care.\n“I always treat people the way I’d want my whānau to be treated, whether it’s a sister, a mother, or my own child, I think about how I’d feel if they were in this situation.”\nThis ethos inspired her to transition into nursing, where she continues to stand as a voice for vulnerable communities, especially Māori. Her experiences motivated her to advocate for culturally safe practices for everyone.\n“It’s about building trust, for many people. Trauma and distrust can make care difficult. But when you introduce yourself, acknowledge their identity, and meet them where they are, you see a shift. It’s a small act, but it can change everything.”\nBeyond her studies, Cerise is committed to making a difference. She strives to embody the values the award stands for—being present, authentic, and courageous in her care.\n“It’s such a privilege to be recognised for something I’m passionate about. This award validates the mahi we do and the support of those who’ve walked alongside me.”\nWith her sights set on building a career that uplifts others, Cerise is determined to continue her journey with humility, strength, and the belief that every act of kindness matters.\nRelated news\n[\nA legacy of care from a dedicated nursing student\n](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/a-legacy-of-care-from-a-dedicated-nursing-student/)\nInspired by her grandmother, Dilimor Lima enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing so she could provide care that blends medical expertise with cultural compassion and Christian love.\n[\nNursing student recognised for generosity of spirit\n](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/nursing-student-recognised-for-generosity-of-spirit/)\nFirst year Bachelor of Nursing student Meg Higgs has been awarded the Jodee Redmond Memorial Award for 2023.\n[\nEverything gained in nursing graduate’s pursuit of knowledge\n](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/everything-gained-in-nursing-graduates-pursuit-of-knowledge/)\nSince completing her Bachelor of Nursing in 2018, Julia Wilson-Orr, Ngāi Tahu, has extended her academic journey twice over to better strengthen her clinical skills and to embrace her passion for research.\n[\nTurning perception into practice: Advocating for cultural safety in healthcare\n](https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/turning-perception-into-practice-advocating-for-cultural-safety-in-healthcare/)\nThe journey to complete a Master of Nursing has served to further ignite the passion Tania Bailey, Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi, Ngāti Rangi, Te Ātiawa, Ngāti Mutunga, has for reducing health inequities for Māori.",
