  "text": "By By Philip Haldiman ,\n5 days ago\nLisa Hale has managed to marry two things she holds dear to her heart — public service and education.\nThe Peoria resident was a National Board-Certified Teacher for many years while teaching second and third grades and mentoring new teachers. Her path as an educator has served her well as a school resource officer at Liberty High School, but she had no idea the two occupations would come to meet.\nMore than a decade ago, she was in patrol and worked in various parts of the city as an officer. When she heard about the role of an SRO from another officer, she was intrigued by the idea of being a fully sworn police officer in a high school.\nHale said she did not have SROs in her schools growing up. So she devoured all there was to know about the position, and soon learned that it was the perfect role for her.\nIt has afforded her the opportunity to be involved with kids of all ages in many different capacities, as well as the opportunity to work with school staff, parents, and community members.\nIt has been a joy being around children and helping them navigate through different parts of their lives, Hale said.\n“When I first became a police officer, I had no idea my two worlds of education and law enforcement would collide beautifully and find me where I am today as the school resource officer at Liberty High School,” she said. “I absolutely love being able to serve not only the students at Liberty High School, but the parents, staff, and various community members that make up the school.”\nFor Hale’s service to the Peoria Unified community, she has been named a Peoria Independent Hometown Hero in the First Responder category.\nThe Hometown Heroes Awards are a celebration of individuals who live or work in the city, and Peoria businesses for their achievements and distinguished contributions to the community and beyond.\nHale will be honored at an awards luncheon next year. The fourth annual Hometown Heroes luncheon will honor those nominated in 2024.\nLiberty High School Principal Shawn Duguid said Hale has been nothing short of a hero in the Liberty High School community.\n“She is on campus day in and day out, constantly proving herself to be a dependable and trustworthy adult that all students and staff feel comfortable in coming to whenever they need something,” he said. “Liberty High School would not be the fantastic community it is today without Officer Hale. She is student-focused and always puts the needs of others above her own. We are beyond grateful to have a Hometown Hero on our team.”\nTaking her love further, Hale is an instructor for the National Association of School Resource Officers and teaches new SROs. She was recently appointed by the NASRO training director to help facilitate the structuring and implementation of a new course, BASIC SRO Refresher.\nShe also serves as the training coordinator for the Arizona School Resource Officers Association, is a member of the Peoria Police Department Recruitment Team and a mentor for new officers in Peoria.\nHale said the city of Peoria is a team effort and being able to be a part of the team, not only as a worker, but as a resident, is a huge bonus.\n“I believe it is important to give back to the community in which you live. Our job is to help those in need for whatever reason, and to use our various strengths and abilities to build an even stronger community,” Hale said. “Living in the city where I work enables me to give back to the community I serve. I believe it is our job to leave the world a better place than how we found it. By working in the city I live, I can see where help is needed and contribute to the best of my ability.”\nPhilip Haldiman can be reached at phaldiman@iniusa.org, or on Twitter @philiphaldiman.
