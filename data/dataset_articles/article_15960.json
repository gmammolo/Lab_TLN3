  "text": "Marin high school students interested in a career in health care could receive early professional training from a program to be launched next year.\nThe pilot course, to be offered in the spring at San Marin High School in Novato, is being developed by the Marin County Office of Education, the Novato Unified School District and By the Bay Health, a nonprofit regional hospice program based in Larkspur.“We are excited to partner with By the Bay Health, one of the most innovative health care providers in Marin County, on this critical initiative to develop a thriving health care workforce to adequately support our growing community,” said John Carroll, the county superintendent of schools.“Introducing students at an earlier age to the diversity of options in the health care field is key,” Carroll said. “By bringing real-world experience and clinical expertise into the classroom, we can expose students to additional career options that will create a tangible impact in our community.”The program, called “Introduction to the World of Healthcare,” will be offered as an elective to 11th and 12th graders at San Marin High School. The curriculum will include subjects such as medical ethics, public health and emerging trends in the profession, according to Jesse Madsen, a career education administrator at the county office.The program will also include hands-on skill practice, role playing, field trips and certification opportunities, Madsen said.The effort is the first step in By the Bay Health’s plan to create “a public and academic partnership aiming to raise $1 million to develop a skilled, compassionate workforce to serve the North Bay’s aging population,” Madsen said.“Our biggest barrier to ensuring access to high quality, accessible care in the home to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and growing population of children and adults in Marin County is recruiting exceptional talent,” said Skelly Wingard, chief executive officer at By the Bay Health. “We are optimistic this partnership with MCOE will inspire more students to join the\ncontinuum of care — particularly in areas like home-based palliative care, hospice care and home health care.”Tracy Smith, superintendent of the Novato Unified School District, said the district is “thrilled” to be a part of the project.“Students are hungry for knowledge about careers where they can find meaning and purpose,” Smith said. “Based on the positive reception to the new course, we’re excited to support this initiative to build more interest in growing fields such as health care.”Madsen said the program will add to related medical career classes at Novato and Terra Linda high schools.In addition to general health care training, the program will have an added focus on nursing and home health professionals. Those workers are in short supply in Marin and throughout the Bay Area, Madsen said.“By 2030, California’s population of individuals aged 65 and older will reach 9 million, nearly 20% of the state’s residents,” Madsen said. “Marin County ranks 13th in the state for this age demographic at 22.3%.”The pilot program could also offer a model of how Marin employers and K-12 schools could work together to provide courses within the school day that lead to “high-demand, livable-wage careers,” Madsen said.“We think this model can be replicated with additional local health care providers and employers in other industry sectors, supporting the development of a homegrown workforce and expanding career pathway opportunities for our students,” he said.By the Bay Health, a nonprofit affiliate of UCSF Health, operates in Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Sonoma, Alameda, Napa and Solano counties. The organization offers hospice and skilled home health care, palliative care, grief support and pediatric care.",
