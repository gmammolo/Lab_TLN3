  "text": "Students at Sentinel High School's automotive department are revved up with the arrival of a brand-new car, thanks to a generous donation. This new vehicle not only benefits Sentinel students but also seniors from Hellgate High School, who travel to Sentinel for hands-on automotive classes. Discover how this impacts their education journey.\nMISSOULA, Mont. – Students at Sentinel High School's automotive department have something new to be excited about: a brand-new car donated to their program.\nThis new addition is not just for Sentinel students. Noah Lofink and Truman Wells, seniors from Hellgate High School, also benefit from the program. They drive over to Sentinel for classes in the automotive shop daily, gaining hands-on skills and more.\n\"I'm a senior over at Hellgate, but I come here for auto and, our fifth period to TA for auto one,\" said Lofink. \"I feel like there's some leadership and leadership skills involved with it. It's a really, really rowdy class.\"\nThe program encourages students to take personal ownership of their projects. Wells, for example, is working on diagnosing an issue with his own engine. He has the skills to make a theory surrounding his engine's issue. \"A lifter in one of these started clicking really badly and then became more catastrophic of the camshaft and just shredded itself... that's my guess,\" he said.\nThe new car is a significant upgrade for the students, as the automotive shop's existing vehicles are much older. \"The newest one I can think of out there is a 2006, so from 2006 to 2024, there's quite a big difference just when it comes to technology,\" said Leah Philbert, Sentinel High School's automotive instructor. \"It's really important for the kids to be up to date on technology.\"\nWells emphasized the value of the new car for learning. \"With the new vehicle that we get, we can learn more from that basis and diagnostics,\" he said. Lofink added, \"It's important to learn the newer technologies, because going into auto or in my case, diesel is a career, it's something I'm going to have to have to figure out.\"\nThe curriculum includes Ford's online training, which is the same used by their professional teams. Sentinel High School has some of the highest student performance in this training nationwide.\nThe car was donated by Lithia Ford, supporting the young community and the future of the automotive industry. \"We couldn't operate our program without the support of people in our community and the businesses around, so this is awesome,\" Philbert stated.\nWith a new car and growing excitement, students at Sentinel High School are ready to rev-up for their futures.",
