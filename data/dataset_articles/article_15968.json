  "text": "Maestro Galo Terán Arteaga in the Diario Crónica . Maestro Galo Terán Arteaga has dedicated himself to the musical field throughout his life. He loves national melodies and, thanks to his vast experience and dedication, has been part of various groups.\nPath\nThe teacher, composer and instrumentalist, is originally from Riobamba, Chimborazo province, but when he was a few months old, he and his family moved to Ibarra (Imbabura), a date that coincided with the 1941 war.\nHe reported exclusively to Diario Crónica that, in this city, he spent his childhood and adolescence; At the age of 21 he decided to go to Loja because an uncle invited him to live here, once there he liked the city and stayed.\nStarts in music\nThe taste for music, and especially for the guitar, has been born for as long as he can remember. He remembers that his father was a musician and led a band; Once the rehearsals were over, they put down the instruments and he began to play some melodies following the steps that they (the musicians) had done during the rehearsals.\nAs time passed he began to have a greater inclination towards this art and formed some trios; Fortunately, in Loja he had the opportunity to enter the Salvador Bustamante Celi Conservatory of Music , where he acquired musical knowledge professionally, specializing in Classical Guitar .\nAt the same time, he formed a group called “Cuerdas Lojanas” with Marco Tulio Hidrobo, Gonzalo Guerrero, Edmundo Guerrero and himself; subsequently, the dance music ensemble “Los Celtics” with Adriano López, Wilman Jaramillo, Enrique Cueva and Hugo Izquierdo; later “Los Roquintz”, with which he played melodies of various kinds, but he always liked Ecuadorian music .\n“I was also part of the University Group with professor Edgar Palacios, which gave me the opportunity to travel to many countries, Romania, Japan, among others, showing what the Castilian city has to offer.”\nDuring his career he also worked as a teacher at the Music Conversation, specializing in Classical Guitar, where he created the Classical Guitar School. Furthermore, he was part of a group called “La Estudiantentina Ciudad de Loja”, composed exclusively of students of guitar, requintos, bandole and recorded three LP .\nAcknowledgments\nGalo Terán Arteaga said that music is a door to enter wherever a person goes, it will allow him to grow and offer good opportunities.\nIn this context, during his more than 65 years of musical life, he has been recognized by the Municipality of Loja, the Ministry of Labor, the National Assembly and twice by Peru. (YO)\nAll the children of maestro Galo Terán Arteaga, who is almost 83 years old, like music, but the one who decided to become professional is Lorena Terán, specializing in piano; He is currently vice-rector of the Salvador Bustamante Celi Conservatory of Music.\nRelated\n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src=” fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, ‘script’, ‘facebook-jssdk’));",
