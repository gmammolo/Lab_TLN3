  "text": "By Victoria Kellogg ,\n5 hours ago\nSYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR-TV)– Syracuse Community Health in partnership with Onondaga Community College opened its third Quick Care Center in Syracuse located on campus.\nHouse torpedoes Democratic-led effort to release Ethics report on Matt Gaetz Athletic Director says SU will ‘do a better job’ attracting fans to women’s basketball games Ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio delivers combative testimony in ex-cops defense Fake bomb threat targets homes of insurance executive killed in NYC: Police NASA delays Artemis moon missions once again The facility is open Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. for students, college employees, and community members.\nThe Quick Care Clinic, located in Residence Hall C, will assist patients who have non-threatening symptoms, such as ear, nose, and throat problems, along with rapid testing.\nThe president of Onondaga Community College shared that students expressed the need to have this type of health center located on campus. So, when the planning began, they were intentional about where they placed the clinic to make it most accessible for students and faculty.\nThe facility even tackles behavioral health services by appointment. The Quick Care location’s clinical administrator, Jessica Yoxall, shares that “a significant need in the community, since COVID and even continuing on now, the need to provide those services and have them be accessible, not only scheduled but when they are needed is critical.”\nThe need was made prevalent when Syracuse Community Health noticed a rush of students going to their main sight on South Salina Street to receive quick care. The only issue was that it was an 11-minute commute.\n“Transportation is a barrier, transportation is costly, many people in the community walk to different locations so we need to be somewhere where they are,” Yoxall said.\nWhen patients come to get treated, they’re not only getting a diagnosis, they’re getting an educational lesson. When they are being examined, physicians are able to describe why patients may feel the way they do based on visuals and text in their room on a large digital screen called Patient Portal.\nFor more information on the new Quick Care Center on campus, click HERE.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
