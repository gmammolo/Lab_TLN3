  "text": "Saige Stahl, a 6-foot-1 sophomore forward for Indiana State women’s basketball, has made an impact on the court this season, particularly on the glass. She’s played in seven games going into Friday night’s contest at Eastern Illinois. She’s averaging 8.4 and 8.7 rebounds per game. ISU coach Marc Mitchell said Stahl brings everything that he wants. He said she puts the blue collar and hard hat on and punches the clock. “That’s exactly what I’m looking for,” Mitchell said. With her on-court play, Mitchell had praise for her toughness talking about how she brings toughness and grit. “That’s what we’re looking for and we need more players like her,” he said. So far, Mitchell has seen a great attitude and a hardnosed kid who is willing to get down and dirty whenever necessary. “She does whatever is necessary for the team,” Mitchell said. He said she’s taken well to his coaching and is one of the players that embraces that and doesn’t let it get to her. “It helps her, so she likes to be coached hard,” Mitchell said. Leadership-wise, Mitchell said Stahl plays the game the way he wants it to be played. Stahl was an Indiana All-Star in her senior year in Columbus East High School. She indicated that she does the same things now as she said she was always aggressive attacking the boards and knowing her advantage for each player she had guarding her. “I feel like I took away a lot from that,” Stahl said. From that she said she’s become better in understanding herself and the IQ of the games. Going into Saturday’s game at SEMO, Stahl had 45 rebounds on the season with 16 of those on offense and 29 on defense. The rebounding is where she said she makes a big impact. She noted her ability to get second possessions so they can have another chance to score. “That really changes the whole energy of the game, and I think that’s what I bring is energy when I come off the bench,” Stahl said. “I know my role and I know that’s what I have to do, just get it going. I always go out there and give it my all every possession of the game.” She said she feels like she’s been a told a lot this year that her hard work is what gets her on the court, and she knows that’s what she has to do every time she steps out on the court. With it being Mitchell’s first season as head coach and new players coming in, she said she feels she’s learned how to understand and read people more in how they play and adjust to that. It hasn’t been easy for the Sycamores this season as they’ve had some tough matchups that has led to a 1-4 record going into Saturday night’s game at SEMO. She touched on the adversity noting how when players get hurt, they have to adjust to a different rotation. Another thing they’ve learned according to Stahl is how to move the ball, play at a different pace each game and to the best of their ability. Tipoff for ISU (2-5) vs. EIU (2-5) is slated for 6 p.m. EST Friday.",
