(WTVO) — Graduates of the Rockford Fire Academy have taken their first steps toward making a difference in the community.\nThe ceremony celebrated 11 Rockford Fire Department recruits along with one from Rock Falls. The academy is a regional training area that focuses on training local recruits.\nAdditional open spots can be used by other departments including Freeport, Sterling and Dixon.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Instructors at the academy are current firefighters who have gone above and beyond to teach based on experience to new recruits.\n‘It gives me an opportunity to look at where we were, how far we’ve come, and how much we celebrate the accomplishments that they make as part of the recruit academy,” said Fire Chief Michele Pankow. “I also love it when we do promotional ceremonies and we come together like this.”\nGraduates of the program went through months of intensive training and challenges. Today’s celebration honored their hard work and future endeavors.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
