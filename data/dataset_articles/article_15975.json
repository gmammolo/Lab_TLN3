(WBOY) — The Salem University Men’s Water Polo team is headed to Stanford University this week to compete in its first-ever NCAA tournament.\nAfter winning the WWPA conference tournament, the team was invited to compete as the only Division II team and will face off against No. 1 UCLA on Friday.\nTwo-time conference player of the year and senior Nikola Krstonosic spoke with 12 News about what winning the tournament meant.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement “It was a huge relief. It was really special winning it with these guys. It’s my last year as well, so it is a huge weight off my shoulders, and it was really special winning it with these guys,” Krstonosic said.\nThis program has spent more than a decade working toward a tournament appearance, but many of the people in the area who interact with these athletes are unaware of what that hard work entails.\n“It’s interesting. When I walk around the mall or the town, I usually tell people I play water polo and they have no idea what that is. They ask me where do you put horses in the water and all that stuff. It’s kind of funny, but it is nice to see that from our small town, we can go top eight and play in NCAA’s and maybe grow the sport a little bit more,” Team Captain Ivan Zivojinovic said.\nUSA Diving ‘American Cup’ coming to Morgantown aquatics center\nAdvertisement Advertisement These two players and many more have come to West Virginia from other countries to help grow the sport and be a part of this team. They’re doing this all while getting a chance to pursue the sport they excel in and other opportunities otherwise not afforded to them.\n“I primarily came here because I had an opportunity to do both school and play the sport that I love. It’s just a sport that I love and enjoy playing,” Zivojinovic said.\nZivojinovic’s sentiment was echoed by Krstonosic.\n“It’s amazing. There is no place else that can give you this. I’m really grateful to be here, to be doing the sport I love, and to be able to finish my degree. It’s amazing. It’s really special,” Krstonosic said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement More in Sports Danica Patrick Keeps Sharing Gruesome Pictures of Her Starbucks Burn Us Weekly Here’s Why Diontae Johnson Refused to Play in Ravens Game COMINGSOON.net Bengals waive player who immediately posts interesting comment about team Bengals Wire “Pop Culture Jeopardy” forced to adjust score after contestant knows obscurest fact about Paul Rudd movie Entertainment Weekly Head Coach Robert Bullion also spoke with 12 News about the growth he has seen throughout his years at the helm of this program.\n“I hate to say it’s been a 14-year journey, but we’ve definitely improved in all areas, both with the growth of athletes, the growth of the school, and the growth of sport. The school is definitely 100& behind us, we’ve got fans traveling every weekend, and that’s pretty cool,” Bullion said.\nThis sport is continuing to grow in popularity and the players welcome it. They said that having an audience is what helps drive them.\n“I mean we are entertainers for the people. We come to play, we practice for the people to watch, and that is the whole point of why we are doing this. Without the people, we wouldn’t be here either,” Krstonosic said.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
