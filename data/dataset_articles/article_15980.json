  "text": "Notre Dame now has five commits in its 2026 recruiting class . The newest is three-star interior offensive lineman Sullivan Garvin from Allegan, Michigan, which is little more than an hour and a half’s drive from South Bend. Garvin made his announcement one day after National Signing Day for the 2025 class.\nAlthough Garvin received offers from other programs after the Irish presented him with theirs Sept. 28, there was no doubt in his mind about where he wanted to go. So Joe Rudolph has his first commit in this particular recruiting class.\nBeing the Irish’s latest commit, Garvin made the interview rounds in the hours after announcing his decision. Fighting Irish Wire was lucky to be one of the outlets to be granted an interview with him. This was made possible after communication with Tracy Garvin, his mother who took notice of us on social media when we reported on his offer from the Irish.\nHere’s what Garvin had to tell us:\nhttps://fightingirishwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/Sullivan-Garvin.mp3 Our thanks to the Garvins for their time and effort with this, and we hope the younger Garvin has a fruitful career with the Irish.\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes and opinions.\nFollow Geoffrey on X: @gfclark89",
