  "text": "Britannica Education, the global leader publishing Encyclopedias, will launch 12 – odd digital learning solutions in India targeting teachers, students and schools.\nThe two products targeting teachers are aimed at upscaling and re-skilling, while the four students focussed offerings will target the K – 12 segments covering digital libraries, e-books and so on. The other six are school-level solutions. All the products will be subscription-based.\n“There is a paradigm shift in the Indian Education Landscape from rote based learning to skill based learning. Britannica Education’s entry is perfectly timed to support the vision of National Education Policy with respect to digital literacy, foundational literacy & numeracy and 21st century skills (4C’s),” according to a statement.\nBritannica’s comprehensive offerings will provide schools and libraries with the tools needed to facilitate digital learning at schools, it added.\nFounded in 1768, Encyclopaedia Britannica is a popular source of knowledge worldwide.\nHaving transitioned from print to digital, Britannica Education now offers a range of online resources that support critical thinking, research skills, and digital literacy for students and educators across the globe.",
