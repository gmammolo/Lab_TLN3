It's a vital bridge to build the state's STEM network.\n“New Jersey’s legacy of innovation is fueled by exceptional talent, and the Governor’s STEM Scholars is at the forefront of nurturing that talent. These Scholars are not only the future leaders in STEM, but they also represent the diversity and brilliance that defines our state,” said Anthony Cicatiello, president of the Research & Development Council of New Jersey. “Through this program, we’re laying the foundation for groundbreaking discoveries that will continue to drive New Jersey’s economy and enhance its position as a global leader in research and development.”\nThrough conferences, field trips and research, Scholars are able to explore professional opportunities that can jumpstart their future STEM careers. Scholars attend four conferences to explore the STEM sectors of industry, academia, and government. For the 2024-2025 programmatic year, these conferences will be held at Rutgers University, Montclair State University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Kean University.\nAdditionally, Scholars build relationships with diverse STEM professionals by attending field trips and fireside chats at New Jersey companies such as Bristol Myers Squibb, Kenvue, Panasonic, PSEG, and Mars Wrigley. Scholars participate in an engineering design research project that will enhance their analytical and 21st century skills.\nOther local recipients Riya Goyal, Stockton University\nFiona Gale, Middle Township High School\nMaahishee Patel, Cumberland County High School\nPaulina Tomlin, Vineland High School\nGSS prides itself in selecting a class that is representative of the diversity of New Jersey.

When these Scholars graduate in May 2025, they will join an alumni cohort of nearly 1,000 Scholars.\n“Through the Governor’s STEM Scholars, New Jersey STEM students are able to learn from and engage with some of the state’s top STEM and R&D professionals, enhancing the students’ knowledge and understanding of career opportunities and introducing them to the STEM economy in New Jersey,” said Alise Roderer, director of the Governor’s STEM Scholars. “With this career knowledge and exposure, we are setting these high school and college students on a path to achieve excellence in jobs of the future.”\nTo qualify for GSS, applicants must have at least a 3.5 GPA, be a high school sophomore through doctoral-level student at a New Jersey-based high school or university, and demonstrate a strong passion for STEM.",
