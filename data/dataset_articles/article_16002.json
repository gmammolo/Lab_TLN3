  "text": "American agriculture students meet China's agricultural heartland American agriculture students meet China's agricultural heartland PR Newswire\nZHENGZHOU, China, June 12, 2025\nZHENGZHOU, China , June 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A report from Henan International Communication Center:\nDuring the busy farming season, wheat across the Central Plains is ready for harvest — and seeds of friendship are quietly being sown across the Pacific Ocean.\nFrom June 3 to June 6 , 22 agriculture students from 16 universities in 15 U.S. heartland states visited Henan , one of China's major agricultural provinces. The trip was jointly organized by the Henan Province , the U.S. Heartland China Association, and the U.S. Soybean Export Council. The students explored wheat fields, visited colleges with a focus on agriculture, and toured food processing enterprises — opening a window to experience China , amid the fragrance of ripened grain.\nOn the northern bank of the Yellow River, harvesters rumbled through golden fields at the Henan Research & D evelopment Base for Modern Agriculture. Under the blazing sun, students visited high-standard farmland, greenhouses, and laboratories, listening closely as staff introduced crop breeding, high-yield cultivation, and precision agriculture. Pens moved quickly across notebooks, recording every detail.\n\" Henan is really similar to my hometown!\" said Samuel Martin , a student at Iowa State University . \" Iowa is also a major agricultural state in America. We even have a big river like the Yellow River — the Mississippi .\"\nFrom the U.S. heartland to China's , from the Mississippi to the Yellow River — the vast fields and harvest scenes felt warmly familiar to the students. But they were amazed by the artificial feat of water engineering before them.\nThe Yellow River crossing project of South-to-North Water Diversion Project is a key symbolic and controlling project. Standing on the bridge, students watched as a stream of clear water flowed northward through two 7-meter-diameter tunnels running underneath the surging Yellow River.\n\"How cool is the way Chinese people manage water resources!\" exclaimed Kyra Smith from Missouri State University. \"This project shows remarkable craftsmanship, innovation, and efficient execution. China's approach to water allocation to promote regional development is truly inspiring — something we can learn from.\"\nIn Henan , agricultural products are also becoming trendy consumer favorites. At the headquarters of beverage brand Mixue, American students eagerly posed for photos with the brand's mascot, \"Snow King\", and tasted hit products like lemon water. Mixue now boasts the most global outlets among freshly made drink brands and has built a full \"farm-to-table\" industry chain.\n\"Will you open stores in the U.S.?\" \"Are there special products tailored to different countries?\" \"How do you ensure smooth overseas supply chains?\"\nThe energetic brand image and long lines outside flagship stores piqued the students' curiosity.\nWhen told Mixue plans to open stores in the U.S., the room erupted in cheers. \"I want to be an intern at your U.S. store — please consider me first!\" joked Salematou Diaby from Kentucky State University , drawing hearty laughter.\n\"I'm looking for an internship related to agriculture, but not just traditional farming,\" she continued. \"This blend of Chinese brands with local U.S. ingredients is fascinating and will help me develop a global perspective.\"\nIt was a fruitful trip for everyone. \"Sustainable agriculture is a global challenge that concerns our future. Henan's agricultural practices gave us a lot of inspiration,\" said Samuel Martin . \"Field visits gave us firsthand exposure to Chinese agricultural wisdom. Though China and the U.S. differ in operation and research models, that difference is what makes collaboration and mutual learning so valuable.\"\nSince the launch of the \"inviting 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years\" initiative at the end of 2023, more than 10,000 U.S. youth have already visited China . The future of China-U.S. relations lies with the people, is rooted in civil exchanges, and thrives in youth and local partnerships.\nIn the season of growth, this spring of friendship flows through the Central Plains. With clear waters and abundant source, the seeds of friendship are sure to take root and blossom.\nView original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-agriculture-students-meet-chinas-agricultural-heartland-302479981.html SOURCE Henan International Communication Center\nThe articles, information, and content displayed on this webpage may include materials prepared and provided by third parties.
