  "text": "June 12, 2025\nUPPER MARLBORO, MD, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Leona R. Monroe, PhD, has been selected for inclusion in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nDr. Leona Monroe has built an exceptional career rooted in her steadfast commitment to education, military service, and public administration. With over two decades of experience in financial management, logistics, and strategic planning, she has consistently demonstrated a strong capacity to lead, innovate, and educate.\nSince 2020, Dr. Monroe has served as an adjunct professor at Liberty University, where she teaches in the Helms School of Government. In this role, she educates and mentors undergraduate and graduate students in financial management, logistics, public policy, human resources, and administration. Her curriculum development, student assessment, and advising have contributed to academic excellence and student success in both traditional and virtual learning environments.\nDr. Monroe's academic work is complemented by her leadership at Deloitte Consulting, LLP where she served as a manager from 2020 to 2025. At Deloitte, she supported federal agencies and state health authorities, managing a $95M federal funding portfolio for COVID-19 response, leading business process reengineering initiatives, and providing strategic financial policy transformation. Her ability to manage complex budgets, implement Agile methodologies, and drive regulatory compliance underscored her impact on high-stakes federal projects.\nHer distinguished 20-year military career with the U.S. Army—spanning active duty, National Guard, and Reserve service—reflects a deep dedication to national service. Dr. Monroe held critical leadership positions, including operations officer in the U.S. Army Reserve (2022–2024), company commander in West Palm Beach, FL (2020–2022), and logistics officer (S4) with the 74th Troop Command Brigade in Washington, D.C. (2018–2020). She has overseen strategic operations for major events including a presidential inauguration, hurricane response, and overseas deployments. Her earlier military roles—ranging from resource manager to logistics supervisor—exemplify operational precision and excellence in mission readiness. Her honors include the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Army Accommodation Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, Humanitarian Medal and numerous other commendations.\nDr. Monroe's academic credentials are equally impressive. She earned a Ph.D. in Public Policy and Administration from Walden University (2017), a Master of Education in counseling from DePaul University (2012), and a Bachelor of Science in paralegal studies from the University of Mississippi (2009). These degrees have provided a multidisciplinary framework for her roles in both military and civilian leadership.\nShe also holds advanced professional certifications including the Department of Defense Financial Management Certification Level 3, Certified Defense Financial Manager (CDFM), Contracting Officer's Representative, Certified Scrum Master, and Army Foundation Instructor Facilitator certification. Her technical fluency spans financial systems, logistics tools, and data visualization platforms such as Power BI and Power Automate.\nBeyond her professional responsibilities, Dr. Monroe remains active in civic and community service. She is a member of the American Society for Public Administration and the Society of Defense Financial Management and volunteers regularly for initiatives such as March for Babies and scholarship fundraisers that generates thousands annually. Her dedication has been formally recognized with the 40 Under 40 Award from the University of Mississippi and a feature in the Tunica Museum honoring her exemplary military service.\nDr. Monroe attributes much of her success to the guidance of mentors who helped shape her path. She now seeks to extend that legacy by continuing to mentor others and promote initiatives in financial literacy, academic success, and mental health awareness. In her personal life, she enjoys supporting her children's activities, volunteering, and traveling. Looking forward, she is also working on a self-help book aimed at equipping scholars with essential life skills.\nQuote by Dr. Monroe:\n\"With unwavering drive and relentless determination, you can rise beyond obstacles- transforming dreams into goals and goals into your greatest accomplishment.\"\nAbout Marquis Who's Who®:\nSince 1899, when A.
