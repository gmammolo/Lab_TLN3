This award is incredibly meaningful to me and reflects the support of the teammates, coaches, and mentors who have shaped my journey. I’m grateful to OΔK for recognizing the leadership that grows on and off the court.”\nAbout Omicron Delta Kappa\nOmicron Delta Kappa Society, the National Leadership Honor Society, was founded at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, on Dec. 3, 1914.
