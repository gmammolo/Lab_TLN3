  "text": "The project extends the functionalities of the open source application OS-APS for formatting and layout of scientific journal articles, evaluates them based on real applications and provides an extended, tested open source platform for formatting and layout of further journals at the end of the project. In addition, handouts for using the platform and web-based forms for creating configurable format templates will be created. The journal movements from critical migration research serves as a pilot project.\nFor researchers, this means less effort when publishing, better discoverability and visibility of their research as well as a technical solution that is freely accessible and independent of commercial providers. Open access journals and repositories, which previously had to invest a lot of time and resources in the manual preparation and formatting of articles, will benefit in particular.\nOS-APS will be used directly at the University of Göttingen: The SUB Göttingen will test and optimize the software during ongoing operations and make it available free of charge during a two-year pilot phase. This will give Göttingen researchers direct access to an innovative, data protection-compliant tool with which they can create their publications in their own corporate design and in several output formats - without any additional technical or financial outlay.\nThe completely open licensing and free hosting offer creates a sustainable system for scientific communication that is oriented towards the common good. This not only makes research easier to access, but also more accessible, comprehensible and easier to archive in the long term - in the spirit of transparent and open science.",
