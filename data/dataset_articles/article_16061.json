  "text": "When my daughter was first diagnosed with autism, I was overwhelmed with fear and uncertainty. But because of accessible, well-funded early intervention programs, we had a village of support to help guide our journey. Therapists, educators and specialists helped her build the skills she needed to thrive — and gave me the hope and tools I needed as a parent.\nRecently, during Ready Louisiana Coalition's Early Ed Day at the Louisiana State Capitol, as a Save the Children Action Network volunteer advocate, I was able to share that my daughter is now thriving as a Girl Scout and 4-H participant; she shines in theater classes, confidently performing on stage; she’s currently learning Russian, having developed a love for languages; and, she even codes her own video games! I proudly see my child communicate, connect and create daily, having had the right support to grow and shine.\nAs a mental health professional working in the early learning sector, I take my daughter’s story into my professional role every day, and I see firsthand how investment in early childhood education reduces costly intervention later in life. I see parents’ lives being positively affected when their children are fully supported through the robust services early childhood programs provide.\nYet, in all that I’ve seen through my personal and professional journey, it saddens me to know that not every child gets these opportunities, though they should. Many families are stuck on waitlists or can’t access the help they need.\nThat is why, as the state budget moves through the Legislature, I am urging lawmakers to protect — and expand — funding for early childhood programs. Because all Louisiana children, no matter their family’s ZIP code or socioeconomic status, deserve to thrive as my daughter is.\nKRYSTLE JOHNSON\nElton",
