  "text": "Institutions from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to Ajman seeing significant rise in applications\nDubai: Amid growing uncertainty over\nstudent visa processing in the United States, universities in the UAE are reporting a significant increase in international applications and interest.\nThe\nadministration of Donald Trump recently issued a proclamation banning international students from attending institutions like Harvard University. Although a federal judge has temporarily blocked the order, the situation has created deep uncertainty among students and parents alike.\nWith visa interviews for international students in the US currently halted, the resulting disruption has sent ripples across global education. UAE institutions are rapidly emerging as attractive alternatives for\nstudents seeking academic stability and global mobility.\nProfessor Dame Heather McGregor, Provost and Vice Principal at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, said that amid growing global restrictions on international student visas, Dubai is becoming an increasingly “attractive study destination.”\n“Our campus recorded a 4.5 per cent year-on-year increase in enrolments for 2024/25, and applications for September 2025 are already 53.5 per cent higher than in the same period last year, driven significantly by the growth in student numbers from international markets,” she said.\nProfessor McGregor highlighted the UAE’s strengths: exceptional infrastructure, a streamlined visa process, and progressive policies such as part-time work opportunities for students.\n“Cities like\nDubai and Abu Dhabi rank among the world’s safest, offering families peace of mind alongside academic excellence, and their geographic location and excellent transportation links mean that students are often nearer to their families than they would be in the US or even the UK.”\nAjman’s Gulf Medical University (GMU) is witnessing a “remarkable increase” in applications, both in volume and diversity, according to Professor Manda Venkatramana, the Acting Chancellor.\n“We’ve observed a significant spike in enquiries and interest from both students and parents across several countries – particularly those who had initially planned to pursue higher education in the US,” he said, highlighting that compared to the same period in previous academic cycles, GMU has recorded a “significant year-on-year growth” in student applications from Asia, Africa, and the Mena region.\nProfessor Venkatramana noted that ongoing US visa delays and policy uncertainty are prompting families to explore alternative destinations.\n“In this context, GMU and the UAE as a whole are emerging as strong contenders, offering world-class education, advanced infrastructure, and global mobility – all without the uncertainty that currently surrounds US institutions,” he said, noting that students and parents are beginning to view the UAE, and GMU in particular, not just as a backup plan but as a primary choice for high-quality, future-focused education.\nAt Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (SUAD), international student interest has “nearly doubled” compared to the same time last year.\n“This growing interest reflects our reputation as a leading French-Emirati university offering world-class education in the heart of the Middle East. The recent visa disruptions in the US may be contributing to this shift, as more students look toward stable, globally connected alternatives,” said Camille Assouline, Head of Communications, Marketing and Public Affairs Division.\nShe noted the UAE’s long-standing appeal as a hub for world-class education, talent, and innovation.\n“We’re still accepting applications for the upcoming academic year, and thanks to our streamlined admissions and visa process, international students can still make the shift smoothly – even at this stage,” Assouline said.\nSign up for the Daily Briefing\nGet the latest news and updates straight to your inbox",
