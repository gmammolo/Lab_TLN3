  "text": "Chinese netizens mourn 'Grandpa Brian,' a beloved English teacher on Xiaohongshu\nFor over a month now, Chinese netizens on lifestyle platform Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book or Red Note) have been mourning a man most have never met in person: a 79-year-old Briton named Brian Smith.\nAffectionately known as \"Grandpa Brian\" by Chinese netizens, Smith was a retired primary school English teacher living in the United Kingdom countryside.\nHe joined Xiaohongshu earlier this year. With a simple self-introduction video and an authentic London accent, he unexpectedly found himself embraced by thousands of Chinese users. His first video on Xiaohongshu garnered more than 20,000 likes.\nSmith turned his garden into a classroom.\n\"This is a compost heap,\" he said, pointing to a pile of garden waste. \"Heap means a large pile.\" Then, pushing a cart: \"This is a wheelbarrow.\"\nChinese users began using his videos as English study materials.\nWhen background music drowned out his voice in early videos, no one complained — they offered editing tips and cheered him on like grandchildren helping their grandpa with his phone.\nFrom short poetry readings to advanced texts about Britain's Industrial Revolution, Smith curated content to suit all levels.\nBut in early April, the videos stopped. His son later confirmed that Smith had passed away on April 7 from a heart attack.\nMany Chinese netizens left messages of remembrance and gratitude under his videos.\nAnd still, the learning of English hasn't stopped. Smith's followers began organizing study groups in the comments section. They correct each other's pronunciation, discuss vocabulary, and have even formed new friendships.",
