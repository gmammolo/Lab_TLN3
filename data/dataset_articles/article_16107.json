  "text": "Managerial Economics Student Melissa Vinding Receives the CA&ES Dean’s Circle Award\nJune 11, 2025\nThe Dean's Circle Award at UC Davis is an award given to outstanding senior undergraduate students in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (CA&ES). It recognizes students who have excelled academically and have made significant contributions to the college and campus.\nMelissa Vinding, earned dual degrees in managerial economics and international relations. During her time at UC Davis, she’s been an active member of several campus groups, including Aggie Studios and Davis Women in Business. Through the UC Davis Bradshaw Scholar program, she interned with the nonprofit National Sobering Collaborative that promotes compassionate, community-based addiction support. She has served as a board member of Imani Legal Clinic and volunteered for the American Civil Liberties Union. Last year, she joined the Student Conference on US Affairs at West Point, collaborating with students nationwide on key foreign affairs issues. One of her favorite experiences has been fostering kittens through the UC Davis Veterinary School's Orphan Kitten Project.\nVinding joined the Managerial Economics major in her second year, saying, “I wanted to add another major with a stronger focus on math and economic applications, since I have a passion for working with nonprofits that focus on economic inequality. The Man Econ major provided exactly that and even allowed me to combine my interests of international business with economics and pursue internships in consulting at PricewaterhouseCoopers. My Bachelor of Science in Man Econ helped me land a full-time role at PwC as a Financial Services Risk Consultant in Boston, MA, where I will be starting after graduation.”\nCongratulations to Melissa!\nMore News\nContact Us\n2116 Social Sciences and HumanitiesUniversity of California, Davis\nOne Shields Avenue\nDavis, CA 95616\nMain Office: 530-752-1515\nStudent Advising Services: 530-754-9536",
