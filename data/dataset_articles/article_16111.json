  "text": "Courage Dzidula Kpodo: First Ghanaian To Be Named MIT’s Best Architecture Student\n- Courage Dzidula Kpodo, a former KNUST student, made history as the first Ghanaian to be given the Arthur Rotch prize at MIT\n- He previously graduated as the 2020 Salutatorian and best architecture student at KNUST, having also earned distinction in his WASSCE\n- While at MIT, he co-founded Postbox Ghana, a cultural preservation project, and has received widespread praise from Ghanaians\nA young Ghanaian man, Courage Dzidula Kpodo, has fulfilled the dreams of many of his peers with his remarkable academic achievement.\nThe former Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) student, against all odds, was awarded for his exceptional achievement in architectural design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nCourage Dzidula Kpodo, an architect from Ghana and a KNUST alumnus, achieved this milestone by being recognised with the Arthur Rotch prize upon completing his master's degree in Architecture at MIT. He was awarded for their innovative approach, technical excellence, and contribution to the field of architecture. This feat makes him the first Ghanaian to claim this accolade at the prestigious American institution.\nCourage Dzidula Kpodo's academic journey\nKpodo's journey to realising even loftier academic dreams began when he earned a distinction in the 2016 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). He further distinguished himself when he graduated from KNUST in 2020.\nAfter completing his architecture degree at KNUST, he was named the 2020 Salutatorian of the College of Art and Built Environment and recognised as the best graduating architecture student.\nDuring his time at MIT, Kpodo co-founded Postbox Ghana. This project utilises popular postcards from post-independence Ghana and architectural archival materials to create new visual references and aesthetic possibilities that draw on collective memory.\nThis initiative reflects his commitment to combining cultural heritage with digital archiving in architecture.\nMany of his close friends attribute his academic prowess to the well-equipped Department of Architecture at KNUST.\nThis department has a history of producing architects and researchers for both local and international built environments. Several professional institutions, including the Ghana Institute of Architects and the Royal Institute of British Architects, also accredit the department.\nReactions to Courage emerging MIT's best student\nYEN.com.gh has gathered some comments from social media users who congratulated Courage on his new achievement. Some of them have been listed below:\n@robengmanu commented:\n\"Legon students can't relate!\"\n@lovesonowusu wrote:\n\"I’m not surprised, I know this beast from KASS.\"\n@beardambassador wrote:\n\"Come and show me an OT boy with this kind of glory.\"\n@ladukekumi commented:\n\"Why plenty Rings on the Fingers like my bro, I know. Hmmm. Congratulations, though, bros.\"\nPortia Dzifa Dzilah wins 2025 Cambridge Teacher Award\nYEN.com.gh had earlier reported that Portia Dzifa Dzilah, an English teacher at Pakro Anglican Basic School, became the first Ghanaian to win the 2025 Cambridge Dedicated Teacher Award.\nHer dedication to education, particularly advocating for girls' education and supporting students through her Sanitary Pads and School Uniform Project, has earned her recognition beyond her community.\nShe was recognised for her Sanitary Pads and School Uniform Project, which supports girls’ education and addresses challenges like poverty and absenteeism.\nPortia dedicated the award to her students, highlighting the importance of education despite challenges.\nNew feature: Сheck out news that is picked for YOU ➡️ click on “Recommended for you” and enjoy!\nProofreading by Samuel Gitonga, copy editor at YEN.com.gh.\nSource: YEN.com.gh\nOluwadara Adebisi (Human Interest Editor) Adebisi Oluwadara is a Human Interest Editor who joined YEN.com.gh in May 2025.
