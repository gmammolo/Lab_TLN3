  "text": "Parents and educators will benefit from a free online information session to help neurodivergent children build friendships.\nFor neurodivergent children, making friends and navigating social situations can be a challenge, but the proper support can make a world of difference.\nA new webinar from allied health provider LiveBig aims to help parents, carers, and educators better understand how to build social confidence and connection in children who think and learn differently.\nLiveBig is a national NDIS-registered provider of allied health and behaviour support service. It works with children and adults across Australia to help them achieve their goals and thrive in everyday life.\nIt states that demand for behaviour support services is rising, with families and teachers seeking practical, evidence-informed strategies to reduce overwhelm, improve regulation, and build confidence at school.\nThe session, Building Social Skills and Friendships, will be held on Thursday, June 12 from midday-1pm. It offers practical, evidence-informed guidance for children to develop authentic, lasting relationships.\nTopics will include identifying when a child may need extra support, common barriers to building friendships for neurodivergent children, social skills and how they develop overtime and how adults can work together across home and school settings.",
