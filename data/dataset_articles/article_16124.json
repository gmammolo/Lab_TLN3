  "text": "Bosch Global Software Technologies Inaugurates Accessible Resource Center (ARC) to Advance Inclusive STEM Education for Students with Visual Impairment\nBosch Global Software Technologies (BGSW), in collaboration with Vision Empower (VE) and the Centre for Accessibility in the Global South (CAGS) at the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIITB), has inaugurated the Accessible Resource Center (ARC)—a pioneering inclusive education hub designed to students with visual impairment through assistive technology and special educators empowerment and training program through a specially curated pedagogy\nAs part of BGSW’s CSR commitment to inclusive and sustainable development, ARC is focused on increasing access to quality STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education for students with visual impairment in Grades K–10, while building the capacity of special educators to provide effective, technology-enabled instruction.\nLocated at IIITB, ARC follows the principles of universal design and is equipped with cutting-edge assistive technologies including tactile tools, refreshable Braille readers, interactive STEM kits, and an accessible Learning Management System. The center currently supports over 250 special educators from 28 schools across Karnataka, directly impacting more than 1,000 visually impaired students. It also emphasizes Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), to build foundational learning pathways for preschool-age children with visual impairments.\nThe ARC initiative addresses key challenges in special education by enhancing access to STEM content, providing specialized teacher training, and improving assistive infrastructure. It aims to drive sustainable, research-driven impact through a multi-pronged approach, which includes:\n- Pragya: Technology-enabled STEM training for special educators\n- Anubhav: Hands-on learning sessions for students using adaptive tools\n- School Cluster Model: Collaborative school networks to tackle shared challenges\n- A structured academic calendar supported by accessible teaching tools, digital content, and mentorship\nA Celebrated Inauguration\nThe launch event featured a ribbon-cutting ceremony and engaging live demonstrations by students and educators, highlighting the transformative impact of assistive technologies in STEM education for the visually impaired. Key attendees included Prof. Debabrata Das, Director of IIIT Bangalore; Mr. Jacob Peter, Senior Vice President and Chairman of the CSR Steering Committee at BGSW; Prof. Amit Prakash, Co-convener of CAGS at IIIT, Bangalore and Ms. Shilpa Deodhar, CSR Head at BGSW; and representatives from Vision Empower, Microsoft Research, Azim Premji University, I-Stem foundation, and other accessibility-focused partners.\nHighlights included the launch of the ARC microsite, the release of a comprehensive Landscape Mapping Research Report on the visual disability sector, and a panel discussion on “Converging to Design Collaborative Spaces for Inclusive Education,” featuring thought leaders from academia, technology, and the development sector. A specially designed tactile chessboard designed by Innovator Mr. Paul Dsouza, for visually impaired individuals was also unveiled, symbolizing ARC’s commitment to innovation, inclusion, and empowerment.\nA Shared Vision for an Inclusive Future\nSpeaking at the event, Ms. Shilpa Deodhar, CSR Head at BGSW, said, “The ARC demonstrates the need for a mix combining inclusive design, customized pedagogy, assistive technology, personalized social engagement, and active community partnerships being instrumental in transforming education for students with visual impairment. We are proud to collaborate with Vision Empower and IIITB to build this holistic model, thereby paving a pathway for sustained impact.”\nThis partnership reflects a long-term vision to build accessible education ecosystems that are collaborative, scalable, and rooted in empathy and innovation. BGSW, Vision Empower, and IIITB remain committed to creating equal learning opportunities for visually impaired students through inclusive design, accessible content, and educator empowerment.\nBosch Global Software",
