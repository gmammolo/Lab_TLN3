  "text": "Work is expected to start later this year Plans go in for new Merseyside school that will cost nearly £60m\nThe new Mosslands School will be a major change for the area (Image: Ellis Williams Architects Limited )\nPlans have gone in for a new Merseyside school, with work expected to start later this year if the go ahead is given.\nThe Mosslands School in Wirral was one of two in Wirral earmarked to be rebuilt in 2022 with funding paid for by the Department for Education (DfE.) The current cost of the project is expected to be just under £58m and will see an entire redevelopment of the school site.\n‌\nThe new school will be built to the south of the existing school site which will enable Mosslands to continue operating in its current buildings while works take place. Parts of the school were first built in 1952 but are now past their expiry date leading to problems such as leaking roofs and a whole host of other issues.\n‌\nWith the redevelopment will come a brand new three-storey school building, a new theatre, two sports halls and fitness suite, a junior pitch, netball courts, a full size county level pitch, and an under 12s pitch alongside an engineering centre and facilities for children with complex needs.
