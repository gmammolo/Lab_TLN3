  "text": "Tran Anh Khoa, academic director at DOL English and a master's degree holder who achieved a perfect 9.0 on the IELTS and graduated salutatorian in English linguistics from the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University-Ho Chi Minh City, said many low-cost English programs on the market offer affordability but come with risks.\n\"Some of these programs stretch short courses into multiple segments without improving quality,\" Khoa said.\n\"In contrast, investing in a quality program from the beginning – despite the higher tuition – can lead to faster progress thanks to a scientific method and optimized curriculum.\n\"This allows students to spend more time on other meaningful activities such as connecting with family, developing talents, improving health, or engaging in socially impactful projects.\n\"These are essential factors for admissions and scholarships in Western schools, where test scores are not the only measure.\"\nKhoa acknowledged that tuition for the IELTS Junior course at DOL English is higher than average but he said the program's value lies in its unique approach.\nThe course incorporates proprietary Linearthinking methodology – designed to accelerate learning compared to traditional repetitive methods.\nLinearthinking has helped thousands of students score between 7.0 and 8.5 on the IELTS test and over 1,500 on the SAT in recent years.\nIt has now been adapted specifically for younger learners.\n\"The course includes custom-designed textbooks, materials, videos, and exercises that address shortcomings in standard curricula,\" Khoa said.\n\"It also integrates language learning with thinking skills, social knowledge, and soft skills.\n\"Essentially, it's a 'four-in-one' program – one course that develops four key areas.\"\nOne common question from parents is why DOL English does not employ foreign teachers for English instruction.\n\"Many assume foreign teachers are better for pronunciation, but that's not always true,\" said Ha Dang Nhu Quynh, a PhD student who also achieved a perfect 9.0 on the IELTS and graduated salutatorian in English pedagogy from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Education.\n\"For Vietnamese students, being taught in Vietnamese when necessary – especially to explain learning methods and concepts – helps prevent misunderstandings.\"\nQuynh added that Vietnamese teachers are more attuned to the differences between English and Vietnamese and can more effectively identify and correct common pronunciation errors.\n\"For example, with the English sound /θ/, students often confuse it with the Vietnamese /t/,\" Quynh elaborated.\n\"A teacher familiar with Vietnamese articulation can easily point out and correct these issues.\"",
