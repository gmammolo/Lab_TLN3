  "text": "Excelsior Correspondent\nJAMMU, June 11: Shri Guru Gobind Singh Tricentenary (SGT) University, Gurugram, today hosted a one-day national seminar titled “Bihar Leads the Rising East” at the CIMP Campus in Patna.\nThe seminar was hosted in collaboration with Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP), Chandragupt Institute of Management Patna (CIMP) and the Public Policy Research Centre (PPRC).\nThe event was aimed to bring together stakeholders from governance, academia and civil society to reflect on Bihar’s development journey and chart new directions for its inclusive development.\nThe seminar was conceptualized under the leadership of Ram Bahadur Rai, Chancellor, SGT University, and Dr Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, former member, Rajya Sabha and Vice-Chairman, RMP.\nThe introductory address was given by Dr Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who said that “Bihar today is emerging not just as a symbol of cultural pride but as the capital of aspirational progress. Institutions beyond Bihar, including SGT University, PPRC and RMP, must collaborate to analyze the Purvodaya model and accelerate development in the eastern states. To realize the vision of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,’ we must document Bihar’s success stories and share its best practices across the nation.”\nSamrat Choudhary, deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, spoke on the tremendous progress the state is making and will continue to make.\n“Bihar is witnessing a historic transformation, where once no new medical colleges or universities came up for decades; today we proudly have 32 universities and a budget of Rs 3.17 lakh crore. With Vikramshila University set for revival and land already allotted, we are reclaiming our legacy and building a stronger future for our youth,” he said.\nProf (Dr) Hemant Verma, Vice Chancellor, SGT University, emphasized the importance of collaboration for development.\nHe said, “Bihar has long been a cradle of intellectual tradition, from Nalanda to Takshashila. As development increasingly pivots toward the eastern states, universities must move beyond academics to engage with public policy, governance, and field-based research. Today’s youth seek more than degrees, they want to understand and influence policies.”\nPolicy insights and success stories were shared by dignitaries including Harivansh Narayan Singh, deputy chairman, Rajya Sabha, B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, Nitish Mishra, Industrial Minister, Bihar and Arjun Ram Meghwal, Union Minister of Law and Justice, Government of India.",
