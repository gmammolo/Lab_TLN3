  "text": "Residents of the Baldwin School District approved the district’s $172.8 million budget for the 2025–26 school year, with 749 votes in favor and 298 opposed during the annual vote held Tuesday.\nThe spending plan supports core academic programs, career and technical education, student support services, technology integration, and ongoing facility maintenance. The budget stays within the state-mandated tax cap of 2.87 percent.\nVoters also re-elected two members to the Board of Education. Susan Cools and Thomas Smyth will each serve new three-year terms beginning July 1.\nIn addition, the Baldwin Public Library budget passed, 781–260.\nVoters also approved three propositions: the use of a technology reserve, the use of a capital reserve, and the establishment of a new capital reserve.",
