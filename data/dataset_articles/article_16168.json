  "text": "Liver health is finally in the spotlight, and honestly, it’s about time. For the longest stretch, people only paid attention to their liver when binge-drinking or during a serious doctor’s visit involving hepatitis. But now? From fatty liver concerns to detox advice and enzyme level checks, the liver is suddenly front and center—and for good reason.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is on the rise, quietly becoming a global health issue. The kicker? You don’t need to touch alcohol to have liver problems anymore. Unhealthy eating habits, excess sugar, a sedentary lifestyle, and stress are enough to mess it up. What’s worse—most people don’t even know their liver’s struggling until things are already serious.And let’s not forget—your liver does way more than process alcohol. It’s your body’s detox champion, filtering toxins from medications, pollutants, processed food, and more. If your liver is under strain, your whole body feels it. From breakouts and hormone issues to fatigue—your liver may be behind the scenes of it all.Thanks to the wellness wave and growing focus on holistic health, people are now looking beyond visible muscles or calorie counts. They want to feel good from the inside out—and a healthy liver is key to that.What Dr. Saurabh Sethi has to sayPopular on social media for his health insights, Dr. Saurabh Sethi recently explained how liver disease develops—starting from fatty liver, progressing to inflammation, and ultimately, cirrhosis if ignored. In his video, he highlighted two key strategies for maintaining liver health:Cutting back on alcoholImproving metabolic healthLet’s break them down.Your liver is a powerhouse, but it needs helpYour liver is like the hardest-working employee in your body—it detoxes, stores energy, breaks down fats, and keeps your internal systems running smoothly. But today’s lifestyle—marked by sugary snacks, lack of movement, and weekend drinking—is taking a toll.Alcohol is a known liver enemy, and not just in large quantities. Even moderate drinking, when consistent, can silently harm your liver. That’s because when the liver breaks down alcohol, it produces a toxic byproduct—acetaldehyde—which causes inflammation and scarring. Left unchecked, this can progress to fatty liver, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis. The scary part? These changes often come without warning signs.The good news: Your liver can regenerate—but only if you stop stressing it. Reducing alcohol intake, even slightly, can give your liver space to heal and function better.The other culprit: Poor metabolic healthEven without alcohol, your liver can suffer—especially when your metabolic health is off. Think high blood sugar, insulin resistance, belly fat—this combo can lead to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now a leading cause of liver damage globally.When your diet is overloaded with refined carbs and sugar, your liver stores the excess as fat. Pair that with low activity and poor sleep, and you’ve got a recipe for chronic liver stress.How to support your liver—The right wayForget expensive liver detox powders or week-long juice cleanses. Real liver care comes down to simple lifestyle shifts:Cut the sugar and processed carbsBe more active—even daily walking helpsEat real, whole foodsGet enough sleepMaintain a healthy weightEven small improvements can pay off. Losing just 5–10% of your body weight can reduce liver fat. Better sleep reduces inflammation. Moving more boosts insulin sensitivity. It's all connected.[With TOI inputs]",
