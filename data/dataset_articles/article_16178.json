  "text": "MULTAN - Agriculture experts have termed the federal government’s decision to send 300 agricultural graduates to China a landmark initiative that reflects serious intent to modernize the country’s farming sector. In his remarks, Dr Shakeel Ahmed, a teacher at Nawaz Sharif Agricultural University, said the federal budget 2025–26 offered balanced and progressive measures for agriculture. He lauded the plan to train graduates in China, calling it a vital move to equip the next generation of agronomists with modern techniques and innovations. “The initiative will expose our youth to China’s advanced agricultural practices, including precision farming, smart irrigation, and climate-resilient crop management,” Dr Shakeel noted. “Such exposure will help strengthen Pakistan’s food security, enhance crop productivity, and promote sustainable farming.” He also appreciated the allocation of Rs4 billion for livestock development and the provision of interest-free loans up to Rs100,000 for small-scale farmers, describing these as “serious and much-needed interventions to support rural livelihoods.” Local farmers echoed these sentiments, welcoming the budgetary focus on agriculture. Ahmad Nawaz, a progressive farmer, called the training programme in China a visionary step and said it would encourage younger generations to view agriculture as a modern, technology-driven profession. Ashnaq Wattoo, a farmer from Vehari, said the move would help reduce production costs and improve efficiency by adopting tried-and-tested international practices. Amir Hamza, who works in the livestock sector, said the Rs4 billion allocation could revive dairy and meat production, especially in rural areas. The farmers agreed that such initiatives were long overdue and expressed hope that consistent implementation would lead to increased productivity, higher incomes, and long-term food security.",
