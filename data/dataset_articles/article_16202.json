  "text": "Privacy Awareness Week is a global campaign that involves both public sector agencies and citizens and aims to improve understanding and awareness of NSW privacy legislation, and to raise awareness of a person's privacy rights and agency obligations.\nPrivacy Awareness Week NSW takes place from 16 - 22 June 2025 and this year's theme is Privacy - it's everyone's business and focuses on privacy being a shared responsibility where everyone has an important role to play. By working together, the protection and security of personal information can be maintained.\nWentworth Shire Council is a proud Champion of Privacy Awareness Week NSW 2025 and is committed to protecting the privacy of NSW citizens.\nIn NSW, your privacy is protected by the:\n- Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (PPIP Act) which outlines how NSW public sector agencies, including government agencies, local councils, State-Owned Corporations and universities, manage and protect personal information\n- Health Records Information Privacy Act 2002 (HRIP Act) which promotes fair and responsible handling of health information. The HRIP Act applies to an organisation in NSW that is a health service provider or that collects, holds or uses health information. This includes both public and private sector organisations.\nThis Privacy Awareness Week, [consider these privacy protection measures to help you be more privacy-conscious:]\n- Protecting your privacy starts with being cautious about what you share. Think twice before posting personal details on social media or other platforms. Only connect and share with people you know.\n- Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts. This helps prevent unauthorised access to your personal information. Regularly update your passwords to enhance security and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.\n- Be cautious of phishing scams and unsolicited requests for personal information. Verify the source before providing any details.\n- Shred unwanted papers that show your personal information.\n- Report any data breaches or suspicious activity to the relevant authorities. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your information.\nAs a member of the public, you have a right to have your personal information protected. If you are concerned about a breach of your privacy by Wentworth Shire Council, you can request us to conduct an internal privacy review. Learn more here Wentworth Shire Council Privacy Management Plan.\nThe Information and Privacy Commission (IPC) can also help you understand privacy laws in NSW and give you information on how to protect your personal information and assert your rights.
