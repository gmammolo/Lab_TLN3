  "text": "EL CENTRO — The Imperial County Office of Education (ICOE) Foundation for Education has awarded $17,500 in scholarships to 35 graduating seniors from nine local high schools, marking a continued commitment to expanding college access for students across Imperial County.\nEach recipient will receive a $500 scholarship to assist with tuition, books and other educational expenses. The students were honored at the ICOE Board of Education meeting held June 9.\n“Congratulations to each of our 35 scholarship recipients,” said Dr. Todd Finnell, Imperial County Superintendent of Schools and President of the Foundation for Education. “We were incredibly moved by their personal stories and inspired by their dedication and resilience. This scholarship is a celebration of their journey and a recognition of the incredible potential each of these students holds.”\nStudents were selected from Aurora High School, Brawley Union High School, Calexico High School, Holtville High School, Imperial High School, Southwest High School, Valley Academy, San Pasqual Valley High School and Imperial Pathways Charter School—ICOE’s dropout recovery program for individuals 17 and over.\nLaunched during the 2019–2020 academic year, the scholarship program has now awarded over $90,000 to local students. The initiative is a cornerstone of the Foundation’s mission to promote higher education opportunities throughout the region.\n“We are grateful for the continued support and generous contributions from our community,” Finnell said. “The Foundation is committed to empowering local students to pursue their dreams. As they embark on their college adventure, we wish them a future filled with discovery, growth and success.”\nAlso recognized during the meeting was Madison Gray, a 7th grader at Wilson Jr. High School, who competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C.\nGray, who won the Regional Spelling Bee in March, was supported by ICOE and the Foundation through a community fundraiser that covered her travel, registration and lodging expenses. She received a $500 check during the meeting in recognition of her achievement.\nThe event also celebrated Ms. Dallana Gomez, Culinary Arts teacher at Calipatria High School, who was named Imperial County Teacher of the Year.\nGomez was honored for her innovative teaching practices, including “Master Chef”-style classroom challenges and real-world catering opportunities. Her students consistently excel at regional competitions, including the IVROP’s third annual CTE Culinary Skills event held May 1.\nSchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union presented Gomez with an award check in recognition of her dedication to career-focused education.\nFor more information about the scholarship program or the foundation’s upcoming Autumn & the Arts Fundraiser, visit\nfoundation.icoe.org.",
