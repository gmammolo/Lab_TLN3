  "text": "This learning unit on venous thromboembolism prevention will support nurses in helping hospitalised patients minimise their risk of developing a blood clot\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is the general term for the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a vein. It includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are both serious conditions that can have long-term health consequences.\nDVT occurs when a blood clot develops in a deep vein, most commonly in a leg but it could be an arm or another part of the body, and PE occurs when a part of a blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs. Quick treatment is vital for both conditions; PE is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention; in a worst-case scenario it can cause death.\nOne difficulty is that both DVT and PE can be asymptomatic and develop silently, although DVT often causes leg pain, swelling, warmth and erythema, while signs and symptoms of PE include chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis.\n“VTE is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalised patients”\nVTE is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalised patients; it can increase the length of a patient’s hospital stay and has huge cost implications for the NHS – an estimated £640m a year, counting the costs incurred in both hospitals and community settings.\nHowever, the good news is that VTEs are often preventable, and there is a well established National VTE Prevention Programme in place in England to try to stop the development of clots in people who are at risk.\nEvery NHS trust has implemented a local approach to VTE risk assessment that incorporates the elements of the national programme’s risk assessment tool, and nurses should be familiar with their local policy.\nThis Learning Unit explains how VTE can cause long-term complications such as post thrombotic syndrome and pulmonary hypertension. It focuses on nurses' crucial role in minimising hospitalised patients’ VTE risk, including risk assessment.\nAfter studying this unit, you should be able to:\n- Explain what VTE is and how it occurs\n- Explain why VTE prevention is important\n- Identify which patients are at risk of VTE\n- List what information should be given to patients about VTE, and when\n- Describe what thromboprophylaxis is and how different methods work to prevent VTE\n- Describe the nurse’s role in VTE prevention\nCompletion can also help support your continued professional development and revalidation.\nEnter the zone here for this and more Learning Units on other topics.",
