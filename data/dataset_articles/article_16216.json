  "text": "Applied Scholastics of Tennessee Brings Powerful Study Tools to Local Youth This Summer 06-12-2025 09:06 AM CET | Science & Education\nPress release from: Binary News Network / PR Agency: ZEX PR WIRE\nNashville, Tennessee, 11th June 2025, ZEX PR WIRE, Applied Scholastics of Tennessee is making a major impact this summer by delivering effective learning strategies to hundreds of young people in Nashville, through workshops and hands-on activities based on the Study Technology developed by author and humanitarian L. Ron Hubbard. The organization is helping students in grades 5 through 12 gain the tools they need for lasting academic success.\nOver the course of the summer, Applied Scholastics educators are partnering with youth organizations to deliver engaging and empowering sessions. Already, the program has reached hundreds of students, many of whom are preparing for the next school year with renewed confidence and practical skills they can apply immediately.\n\"Study Technology isn't just about memorizing facts,\" said a spokesperson for Applied Scholastics of Tennessee. \"It's about truly understanding what you're learning and removing the barriers that can make studying frustrating. When students learn how to learn, it transforms their entire experience with education.\"\nStudy Technology includes tools that help students recognize and overcome three primary barriers to learning: lack of mass (or physical representation), skipped gradients, and misunderstood words. These principles are taught in an easy-to-understand format and are immediately usable by students of all ages and learning levels.\nParents and community leaders have praised the program for its positive influence, especially in reaching students during the summer months when academic support is often lacking.\nApplied Scholastics is a nonprofit, non-religious organization that has helped millions of students worldwide. The Tennessee chapter is proud to be part of this global movement to improve literacy and learning through effective, proven tools.\nFor more information on upcoming workshops or to bring Study Technology to your youth group, contact Applied Scholastics of Tennessee by reaching out to edapstn@gmail.com.\nThis release was published on openPR.",
