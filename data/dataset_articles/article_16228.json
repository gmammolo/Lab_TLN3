  "text": "India's Best Colleges 2024\nHow executive upskilling is fueling India’s leadership pipeline\nUpskilling is a mindset that empowers individuals and organisations to grow together, shaping stronger leadership and future-ready workplaces\nIn today’s fast-moving world, those who grow with change are the ones who stay ahead. Leadership today isn’t defined by how long someone has been in the system or what title they hold. It’s defined by how open they are to learning, adapting and helping others move forward.\nUpskilling is one of the most powerful ways professionals can unlock new opportunities. It builds confidence, sharpens thinking and deepens the sense of responsibility. It’s not just about career growth.\nThe best leaders are lifelong learners. They stay curious. They don’t wait for someone to push them. They actively seek new skills, perspectives and ideas. And when teams see their leaders learning, they feel inspired to grow as well. This kind of mindset builds a strong connection at work. It’s no longer just about ticking off tasks. It’s about growing together and creating a culture where people feel seen, heard and supported.\nUpskilling is for everyone, not just leaders\nIn today’s work culture, learning and development must be for everyone. It should not be seen as a one-time activity but as part of the system. In fact, upskilling should be included in every employee’s KRA and KPI. It should be measured, supported and recognised like any other key performance area.\nOrganisations also need to actively encourage a culture of continuous learning. When learning is championed from the top and made accessible across levels, it becomes a shared priority, not just a personal initiative.\nIt also needs to be sector agnostic. Every department, not just sales or tech, needs access to learning that aligns with the company’s vision. Whether it’s HR, marketing, finance or operations, every team has a role in shaping the future. And they deserve tools that help them grow with it.\nWhen companies make upskilling a regular practice, they send a clear message: growth is for all. Skills should evolve with changing business needs, and that evolution should happen at every level.\nIt reflects company ambition and builds stronger bonds\nUpskilling also says a lot about the direction in which a company is headed. A business that invests in its people is serious about long-term success. In many ways, upskilling reflects the growth rate of a company. It’s a one-time investment in each employee, but the returns are long-lasting. It improves retention, strengthens trust and creates stronger alignment between individual goals and business outcomes.\nBefore launching any upskilling programme, it’s important to begin with conversations. Understand employees' aspirations and help them see how their growth aligns with where the company is going. These discussions bring clarity and show that the organisation values its people, not just their performance.\nHowever, it’s important not to run generic courses just for the sake of having a programme in place. Every learning initiative should be purpose-driven and future-ready. When upskilling is planned with intention, the outcomes are more impactful for both the company and its people.\nStaying relevant means staying curious\nAs industries continue to evolve, staying relevant means staying open to learning. New technologies and shifting market dynamics are changing not just how businesses operate, but also how roles are defined. As marketing, operations and even customer service evolve through AI, automation and analytics, the nature of jobs is transforming too.\nPeople who invest in their development don’t just cope with change, they embrace it. They adapt faster and take on larger roles with confidence. This same thinking applies to leadership. Upskilling helps professionals move from simply managing tasks to leading with clarity and care. It strengthens decision-making, communication and problem-solving, all of which are critical in today’s unpredictable environment.\nIndia’s growth story is closely tied to the kind of leadership we nurture. We need professionals who are driven by values, grounded in ethics and ready to guide teams through change. This kind of leadership doesn’t come from titles. It comes from a commitment to learn and lead with purpose.\nWhen companies and employees grow together, the bond becomes stronger and more meaningful. That mutual investment lays the foundation for long-term success.\nThe future of work is not about standing still. It’s about moving forward with intention. Upskilling is the fuel that drives this journey. It’s not just a learning tool, it's a mindset. One that shapes careers, strengthens companies and supports India’s leadership pipeline for the future.\nThe author is the CEO, Jaro Education",
