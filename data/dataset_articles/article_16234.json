  "text": "Erasmus+ Programme, has officially wrapped up on a high note with the endorsement from Malta’s National Authority, the European Union Programmes Agency (EUPA). In its final evaluation, EUPA applauded the project’s bold approach to transdisciplinary innovation in higher education and its meaningful societal impact, emphasizing the its relevance for students, educators and professionals alike for its forward-thinking approach to the challenges of the post-COVID world.\nTo ensure long-term impact, the consortium released a set of free,online toolkits for educators and course planners which enables them to embed the ScicultureD approaches in educational and professional setting:\n- The CourseKit and CourseKit Lite (for 1-2 hours workshops) is a toolkit consists of 7 different suits of prompt cards and a board facilitating the design thinking approach. This toolkit brings people from different fields together to collaborate and create effective courses which focus on a locally-felt, real-world challenge.\n- The\nEngageDkit, stemming from the CourseKit, is a card-based toolkit co-developed with the Horizon Europe project JUSTNature for inclusive science communication and public engagement activities, rooted in the CourseKit approach. EngageDkit is delivered through an immersive role-playing game which helps the participants take the perspective of their audiences, and then the organisers can create innovative events effective to that group. - These resources are available\nonline, where interested educators can also contact project tutors for a printed version, guidance and collaboration.\nlaunch the Centre for Research in Transdisciplinary Education (CRETE), a vibrant new centre connecting research within and across disciplines, working with partners to enrich our thinking about education - places at this hybrid event can be booked in the link below.\nThe consortium celebrated the publication of a peer-reviewed scientific article stemming from the previous project Sciculture (2019-2021). \"Conceptualising and exploring creative pedagogies and design thinking in transdisciplinary STEAM higher education courses\" is now available and open access on Research Papers in Education journal.\nThe article highlights the key creative pedagogy features (namely transdisciplinarity, embodied dialogue, empowerment and agency, and ethics and trusteeship) and design thinking approach working together in productive patterns, helping teachers and partners establish new learning strategies and offering insight into how transdisciplinary learning around complex problems can be facilitated in STEAM Higher Education.\nThis theoretical framework and the practical insights were the starting point for SciCultureD, which continued investigating the roles of transdisciplinarity, creativity and STEAM approaches in Higher education as essential tools for societal transformation.\nScicultureD intensive coursethrough her unique knowledge, and much loved presence.",
