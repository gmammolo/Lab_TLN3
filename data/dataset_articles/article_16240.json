  "text": "For 30 years, Amy Aguon has taught English as a second language to elementary students, but it wasn’t until the COVID-19 pandemic that she discovered a gap in children’s literature that compelled her to pick up her pen.\n“I just don’t see the stories that I’m writing. I don’t see them out there,” Aguon told The Guam Daily Post. She has authored seven self-published children’s books rooted in CHamoru culture, legends and island superstitions. “I’ve been talking to some adults and they’ve never heard of that legend of Chaifi, and someone even asked me, are you making that up? And I said, no, it’s one of the Guam legends.”\nAguon’s books, available on Amazon for about three years, are part of what she describes as “a growing movement to bring more Pacific Islander stories to young readers around the world.” Her work fills a specific niche in children’s literature by transforming traditional CHamoru legends into accessible picture books for readers ages 5 to 9.\n“I see that although we have books about legends, they’re all compilations. And so what I’m putting out there are picture books of the legends,” Aguon said.\nThe Marcial Sablan Elementary School teacher has created two distinct series. Her first focuses on individual CHamoru legends, including the story of Chaifi, a creation figure in CHamoru mythology.\n“A lot of people don’t know… we have Guam CHamorus’ own story of creation. And so Chaifi is the one who created man according to the legend,” she said, noting that this particular story targets slightly older children, ages 9 to 12, due to its complex themes.\nHer newer series centers on Tressy, a young Guamanian girl who experiences different cultural superstitions and learns about legends alongside her brother, Tony. The character’s name holds special significance.\n“Tressy means 13 in CHamoru, and ‘Tressy’s my mom’s nickname. So, the character’s… named after my mom,” Aguon said.\nThree books in the Tressy series have been published so far: \"Tressy and the Taotaomo’na,\" \"Tressy’s Wet Hair\" and \"Tressy and the Utak.\" Each 32-page paperback book incorporates local superstitions that many island residents may not be familiar with.\n\"Tressy’s Wet Hair\" tells the story of a girl who loves to bathe but, one night, decides to shower after her mother tells her to wait until morning.\n“She didn’t listen. She waited until her mom fell asleep and she went into the shower and her hair was wet,” Aguon said. “She didn’t want to turn on the blow dryer because she would wake her mom and get scolded. So, she went to sleep with wet hair. And then when she woke up, she had a crooked mouth. And so… that’s the superstition. Don’t sleep with wet hair.”\nAnother book introduces readers to the Utak, a superstitious bird associated with pregnant women.\n“You would see it if there’s a pregnant woman,” Aguon said. “You know, I’ve never seen it. It’s kind of like the Taotaomo’na. You know, no one’s really seen it.”\nAguon not only writes her stories but also illustrates them. She initially experimented with artificial intelligence for her earlier works before transitioning to hand-drawn illustrations.\n“My earlier books, the very first ones, they were more, I was kind of experimenting with AI. So, some of the books are AI. But then I started (to) move towards doing the illustrations myself,” she said.\nThe books include practical educational elements, such as glossaries that explain CHamoru words used in the stories. For example, readers learn that “tata” is “a loving word for dad or grandfather,” and “pugua” means “betel nut,” complete with pronunciation guides.\nAccording to Aguon, the response from the community has been overwhelmingly positive.\n“So, I gave each teacher at my school a book. And they all were saying, ‘Oh, how the illustrations were so cute.’ And they’re asking me, ‘How did I get that name Tressy?’ And they just really liked it,” Aguon said.\nThe books serve a particularly important purpose for CHamoru families living off-island.\n“I’m writing these books for, especially, a lot of my family members who have children, grandchildren off island,” she said. “They’re asking me, ‘Oh gosh, can I have some books? I’d like to buy some of your books.’ They’d like the culture to continue on with their extended family who are in the States.”\nCurrently available exclusively through Amazon, Aguon is exploring local distribution options. She has reached out to Bestseller bookstores and recently announced her books will soon be available at Rexall Drugs in the locally featured artists section. She’s also considering pop-up events and direct sales to make her work more accessible to island families.\nBeyond her self-published works, Aguon has submitted manuscripts to the University of Guam Press, including a book about her mother’s experiences during World War II’s occupation of Guam, targeted toward middle school readers.\n“I’m kind of helping to fill this need for more stories about our island, our culture,” Aguon said. “I just want to teach… children and adults about some of our superstitions.”",
