  "text": "With iOS 26 update, Apple gives parents more control over who kids can text\nApple's iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families.\nIn Short\n- Apple is giving parents more power over who their kids can talk to on their iPhones\n- Whenever a child tries to message someone new, the parent will get a request in the Messages app\n- The new approval system works beyond just iMessage\nApple’s iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families. With growing concerns around online safety for children, Apple is giving parents more power over who their kids can talk to on their iPhones. Now, whenever a child tries to message someone new, the parent will get a request in the Messages app and can approve or deny it with a single tap. This makes it harder for unknown contacts to reach children and gives parents a better grip on their kids’ digital lives â€” all without needing to constantly check their devices.\nThe new approval system works beyond just iMessage. Apple is opening it up to third-party apps through a new tool called PermissionKit. So, if a child tries to follow someone on a social media app or send a friend request, the parent can still step in. Even if a child doesn’t have a dedicated ‘Child Account’, Apple is applying sensible limits like web filters and communication blocks by default for teens. There are also better age ratings in the App Store, such as 13+, 16+ and 18+, so parents can make more informed choices before letting their child download an app.\nCommunication Safety is also seeing a major upgrade. iOS 26 will now automatically blur photos with nudity in FaceTime calls and shared photo albums. Parents will also be able to grant exceptions if they’re okay with their child downloading an app that’s rated older than their set restrictions. The whole experience feels more flexible while still putting safety first.\nBut there’s a lot more to iOS 26 than just parental controls. The update introduces a fresh new look with Liquid Glass â€” a glossy, translucent design that makes app icons, widgets, and system menus feel more alive and dynamic. The Lock Screen and Home Screen now support better customisation, while the Camera and Photos apps have been cleaned up for clutter-free navigation.\nThe company has also added new abilities to its Apple Intelligence system. It brings smart tools like live translation directly into Messages and FaceTime, so you can talk to people in different languages instantly. Safari has become more useful with page previews and better screen use, and Apple Music now translates lyrics so you can understand international songs more easily.\nThere’s also a new Apple Games app to manage all your games in one place, and improvements to CarPlay, Wallet, and Maps â€” including features like on-device route suggestions and live boarding passes.\nThe stable iOS 26 update is expected to roll out this September as a free update on iPhone 11 and newer devices. For those eager to try out the latest updates? Well, if you’re a developer, you can dive in right now via the Apple Developer Programme. For everyone else, a public beta rolls out next month through the Apple Beta Software Programme.\nApple’s iOS 26 update brings a lot of exciting new features, but one of the most meaningful additions is aimed at families.
