  "text": "Responding to the growing demand for English-medium education, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation will convert five of its schools into semi-English institutions KALYAN: With demand for English-medium schools, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has decided to convert five out of its 61 schools—including 55 Marathi-medium schools—into semi-English medium institutions. In these selected schools, Mathematics, English, and Science will now be taught in English. KDMC Commissioner Abhinav Goel stated at a press conference that the civic body has renovated all its schools this year. The upgrades include repairs to school buildings, painting, replacement of damaged benches, and other facility improvements. He further added that around eight schools were completely renovated and newly equipped. Additionally, KDMC has made arrangements to distribute books, bags, and raincoats to students on time as the academic year begins. KDMC’s Deputy Municipal Commissioner Sanjay Jadhav mentioned that out of the total 61 schools, two are Urdu-medium, one Hindi-medium, and one Tamil-medium. The remaining are Marathi-medium schools attended by children from economically weaker families who cannot afford private education. Considering the rising preference for English-medium education, KDMC has decided to convert one school each in Titwala, Kalyan East, Kalyan West, and Dombivli East and West into semi-English schools. To support this change, KDMC’s education department has appointed its best teachers to these schools. This initiative aims to help underprivileged parents provide English education to their children without the financial burden of private schooling, while continuing to support Marathi as a medium of instruction.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
