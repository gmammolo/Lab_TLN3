  "text": "SAP Rolls Out Technology Training Initiatives Across the Middle East\nSAP University Alliances has launched its Business AI Roadshow in the UAE as the latest in a series of collaborations aimed at equipping young people across the Middle East with in-demand technology skills. The UAE interactive tour – which was launched in collaboration with the SAP Business Women’s Network and in partnership with Deloitte and Zayed University – introduces university students to real-world applications of AI in business while demonstrating how SAP technologies are shaping the future of work.\n\"Through these programs, we’re helping to nurture a new generation of talent that will lead the digital transformation of the region,\" said Marwan Zeineddine, Managing Director of SAP UAE. \"Empowering youth with advanced skills in AI and digital technologies is essential for building the knowledge economies of tomorrow.\"\nAt each stop on the Business AI Roadshow, students participate in live demonstrations and hands-on activities that illustrate the role of AI in solving complex business challenges. The sessions also explore how companies across industries are embedding AI into their core operations. Participating students gain practical insight into how to navigate and thrive in a digital-first workplace.\nThe roadshow builds on the success of SAP's inaugural MENA Learning Tour to the company’s global headquarters in Walldorf, Germany. There, select students from the region’s universities met SAP executives including CEO Christian Klein and gained exposure to cutting-edge innovation through workshops, labs, and career mentorship opportunities. Students were given the opportunity to pitch business cases, explore new approaches to design thinking and agile collaboration, and experience what it is like working at SAP.\nThe response from students was overwhelmingly positive. Mouza Alnuaimi, an Information Technology and Network Security student at Zayed University, UAE, said: “From day one, we were immersed in a learning journey, from Design Thinking sessions on AI to engaging with professional mentors. Living a day alongside SAP employees and experiencing their passion was inspiring.”\nLaunch of SAP Learning Hub for Students\nThese learning initiatives are part of a wider effort by SAP to strengthen links between academia and industry. Central to this is the global launch of the SAP Learning Hub, Student Edition, which offers university students flexible, online access to over 1,500 learning assets including interactive e‑learning courses, expert-led webinars, and hands‑on practice systems. Through the Hub, students can follow curated learning paths aligned to emerging job roles in AI, data analytics, and enterprise resource planning.\nBeyond self‑paced study, the Hub provides exclusive access to community-led study groups and live Q&A sessions with SAP experts, enabling peer collaboration and real‑time feedback. Learners can earn industry-recognized SAP certifications, from Associate to Professional levels, and showcase digital badges on their professional profiles. By democratizing access to cutting-edge SAP content, the Learning Hub empowers students to build in-demand skills and stand out in today’s competitive job market.\nSAP’s education programs support national transformation agendas across the region by helping build digital talent pipelines and by fostering inclusive, innovation-driven economies.\nBackground Information\nSAP\nSAP is at the center of today’s technology revolution. The market leader in enterprise application software, SAP helps organizations fight the damaging effects of complexity, generate new opportunities for innovation and growth, and stay ahead of the competition.\nVisit our corporate site to explore news, information for investors and analysts, career resources, SAP’s history, and more.",
