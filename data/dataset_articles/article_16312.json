  "text": "THE government is considering the establishment of a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Commission, in line with the country’s ongoing TVET reform agenda, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim announced today.\nSpeaking at the National TVET Day 2025 celebration at the Melaka International Trade Centre (MITC) in Ayer Keroh, Anwar said the proposal stems from the encouraging progress of the TVET sector under the National TVET Council, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.\n“I appreciate the role of the TVET Council, but as those closely monitoring the sector’s development, we must consider proposals such as establishing a dedicated commission for TVET, and we will assess this as swiftly as possible in response to the sector’s evolving needs,” he said.\n“With the number of students and types of training increasing, I, together with the Ministry of Finance (MOF), will look into whether current facilities are adequate and how to create synergy between government-linked companies, private sector players, and existing TVET institutions.”\nAnwar emphasised the importance of TVET as a national development agenda to produce a skilled and high-quality workforce that meets future industry demands. He also called for a revision of the starting salary for TVET graduates to reflect their specialised skills.\n“Previously, we set the minimum wage at RM1,700, but if certain TVET fields report employability rates as high as 98 per cent, that salary level is inadequate. Therefore, we want to raise the starting salary to RM3,000, if possible,” he stated.\n“This step is important to ensure the expertise of TVET graduates is recognised and valued by multinational and local companies.”\nAt the same event, Anwar announced an additional allocation of RM40 million to the National TVET Council and RM10 million to the Melaka state government to strengthen TVET entrepreneurship development.\n“Young people must seize this opportunity to contribute to national development. When we look at neighbouring or developing countries, few are able to implement such rapid transformation in elevating the status of TVET like Malaysia has done,” he said.\n“If our children tell their parents, this is Malaysia – the only country that provides support and funding not only for TVET students but also for young huffaz – they are not wrong.”\nNational TVET Day 2025, themed ‘TVET: The Preferred Career Choice’, showcases nine sectoral exhibition concepts including Transport and Automotive; Aerospace; Electronics and Digital; Advanced Manufacturing; Energy; Rail and Maritime; Plantation, Agriculture and Livestock; Construction; and Services.\nThe three-day event, which concludes tomorrow, offers around 5,000 job opportunities across various sectors, with participation from more than 60 companies and employers both within and outside Melaka.\nTwelve ministries are involved in organising the celebration, including the Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Rural and Regional Development, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Human Resources, and Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI).\nNational TVET Day, observed annually on 2 June, reflects the government’s commitment to making TVET a central platform for cultivating a dynamic, skilled and competitive future workforce.\nIn conjunction with the celebration, the ASEAN TVET Council’s 4th Regional Policy Dialogue (ATC 4th RPD) is also being held over two days starting yesterday. - June 12, 2025",
