Who knew that with a little time and patience, he could become a beautiful butterfly? But the two-week wait inside his chrysalis feels interminable. “Can I get a comic book?” “What if I need the bathroom?” “Anyone want to play a game?” His fellow caterpillars all tell him to be patient and let nature take its course, but the waiting is just so hard. Can he do it? Find out as this hilarious tale is read t and make a butterfly craft.\n- June 24 — The Bat by Elise Gravel — The Bat covers habitat (bats live everywhere except Antarctica!), species (there are over 1,200 kinds of bats), echolocation, hibernation (bats hibernate just like bears!), conservation (don’t disturb a sleeping bat!) and much more. Although silly and off-the-wall, The Bat contains factual information that will both amuse and teach at the same time. This fun story will be read and participants can make their own hanging bats.\nSea Turtle Adventures\nTuesday at 1 p.m. Sea turtles are frequent visitors to the North Carolina coast, with several individuals nesting on beaches from the Outer Banks to Ocean Isle Beach.

Put your ID skills to the test through a fun shell sorting and matching activity.\nBeach Basics\nWednesday at 3 p.m. This is an introduction to common beach creatures and beach safety! Test your ocean IQ by learning about sea creatures such as jellyfish, sea stars, sharks, and sea turtles and discover how to keep them and yourself safe while having fun in the sun. Beach safety tips, including what to do when swimming alone and how to help someone in the water, will be given through interactive discussion. The program will end by making a fun sea bottle craft.\nShark Smarts\nThursday at 11 a.m. How many sharks live off the coast of NC? Do sharks really eat people? Find out in this fun, interactive program! This program will look at the amazing world of sharks and what makes them unique. Learn about shark anatomy, diets, and predators, and bust myths and misconceptions about sharks. It will also discuss some “shark smarts” that will keep you and others safe while you have fun in the sun. At the end of the program participants will make a fun shark craft, designing our own shark jaws.\nSwamp Sleuths\nThursday at 1 p.m. This visitor favorite program is back with a new mystery! Learn about the diversity of life in the Green Swamp in this CSI program that is fun for all ages. Someone has destroyed Rhonda the Virginia Rail’s nest and we need your help to find out who did it!

Then compile the evidence and narrow down the suspects to put your swamp sleuthing skills to the test.\nPollinator Pals\nThursday at 3 p.m. Pollinators come in all shapes and sizes from bees and butterflies to birds, bats, moths, and wasps.
