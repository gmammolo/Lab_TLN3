Her office was ordered to align itself with internal trade laws and stop requiring these individuals to have 450 hours of nursing experience in Canada in the past two years or 1,225 hours over the past five years to be registered locally.\nThe college defended its now-defunct rules as a response to a wave of complaints about competency — such as the inability to take or interpret vital signs — made about professionals approved via its “labour mobility applicant” stream.\n“Over the last few days I’ve heard from some nurses who have had their confidence shaken, and so I want nurses to know: you are welcome in Manitoba,” Asagwara said Wednesday.\n“The creation of a dedicated navigation role, increased flexibility in documentation and assessment processes and efforts to reduce delays are tangible steps forward,” said the union leader who represents 13,000 nurses, many of whom are IENs.\nJackson said the union has long advocated for “a more compassionate, efficient and equitable registration process” that recognizes IENs’ diverse experiences and upholds public safety.\n“IENs are not the problem — systems that under-prepare and undervalue them are. We want IENs to thrive in Manitoba. We want them respected, supported and safe,” she said. “That means regulation must go hand in hand with wraparound supports in practice settings.”\nThe regulatory body’s news release touted the changes as a way to reduce duplication, improve clarity and help IEN applicants transition into the workplace faster.\n» Winnipeg Free Press",
