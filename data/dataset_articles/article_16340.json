  "text": "According to the previous year trends, the list of NITs for 7000 rank in NIMCET 2025 include NIT Agartala, NIT Raipur, and NIT Patna. The final allocation will be done during the NIMCET counselling 2025.\nThe list of NITs for 7000 rank in NIMCET 2025 comprises NIT Meghalaya, NIT Patna, NIT Agartala, and others, where there is less demand for MCA programs. The final seat allocation will be done based on the\nNIMCET 2025 cutoff, which will be released during the counselling process.\nNIMCET is the national-level exam for admission to\nMCA programs at participating NITs. Thus, candidates willing to gain admission to any of the institutes with a 7000 rank in NIMCET must keep a check on the probable list.\nIn practice, a rank as high as 7000 is not considered strong – even mid-tier NITs often have closing ranks in the low hundreds. In general, a 7000 rank would only secure admission under certain reserved categories (SC/ST) at NITs with very high cutoffs. The following sections list the NITs that historically had very high closing ranks (often via reserved seats), explain key factors, and outline the admission process.\nNITs for 7000 Rank in NIMCET 2025 for MCA Admission\nVery few NITs fill seats around rank 7000 through\nNIMCET 2025. In the last few years, only reserved-category seats at certain NITs closed that high. For example, in NIMCET 2024, the ST cutoff at NIT Patna was about 7771-7956, and at NITK Surathkal (ST) it was around 4654. By contrast, open-category cutoffs at Allahabad and Surathkal were only ~180 and ~114. The table below lists some NITs that typically have the highest closing ranks (often via SC/ST seats), along with their approximate closing rank range and average MCA tuition fee:\n|\n|\nInstitute Name\n|\n|\nClosing Rank (Approx.)\n|\n|\nAverage Annual Tuition Fee (INR)\n|\n||\n|\n7,700 – 8,000 (mostly ST)\n|\n|\nINR 1.23 Lakh\n|\n||\n|\n6,000 – 6,200 (mostly ST)\n|\n|\nINR 2.10 Lakh (Allahabad fee used as proxy)\n|\n||\n|\n4,800 – 5,000 (ST)\n|\n|\nINR 2.10 Lakh\n|\n||\n|\n4,800 – 5,000 (ST)\n|\n|\nINR 2.00 Lakh (approx.)\n|\n||\n|\n4,400 – 4,700 (ST)\n|\n|\nINR 2.01 Lakh\n|\n||\n|\n4,000 – 4,200 (SC/ST)\n|\n|\nINR 1.87 Lakh (estimated)\n|\n||\n|\n2,400 – 2,500 (ST)\n|\n|\nINR 1.40 Lakh\nEach closing-rank range above is an estimate based on previous years’ cutoffs. For instance, NIT Patna’s MCA ST seats closed near 7956, while Allahabad’s ST was ~4893. General-category seats at these NITs have much lower cutoffs (e.g. Allahabad ~180), so a 7000 rank in the General category would not be enough. The fees are typical annual tuition; actual fees may vary by institute.\nIs 7000 Rank in NIMCET 2025 Good?\nA rank of 7000 in NIMCET is generally not good – it falls into the “Poor” performance zone. Candidates with a rank in the 6001–10000 range are usually admitted only in very limited cases (often via ST/SC quotas). Below is a general grade chart showing the\nNIMCET marks vs rank analysis 2025:\n|\n|\nMarks (out of 480)\n|\n|\nExpected Rank Range\n|\n|\nRemarks\n|\n|\n360+\n|\n|\n1 – 100\n|\n|\nExcellent\n|\n|\n300 – 359\n|\n|\n101 – 500\n|\n|\nVery Good\n|\n|\n240 – 299\n|\n|\n501 – 1,500\n|\n|\nGood\n|\n|\n180 – 239\n|\n|\n1,501 – 3,000\n|\n|\nAverage\n|\n|\n120 – 179\n|\n|\n3,001 – 6,000\n|\n|\nBelow Average\n|\n|\n60 – 119\n|\n|\n6,001 – 10,000\n|\n|\nPoor\n|\n|\nBelow 60\n|\n|\n10,001+ (Low chances)\n|\n|\nVery Poor\nNIMCET Closing Ranks 2025(Expected)\nThe closing ranks for admission of candidates, as allocated, most likely followed a similar pattern throughout all ten participating NITs. It is important to remember that to secure a position at each NIT, you must pay attention to the previously mentioned anticipated NIMCET Cut Off 2025. The official closing ranks for each institute are listed in the table below, which candidates can use to determine their category-wise ranking:\n|NIT||OPEN||OBC-NCL||SC||ST|\n|NIT Trichy||40||100||450||1100|\n|NIT Warangal||90||210||520||1300|\n|NIT Surathkal||180||320||750||1700|\n|NIT Allahabad||220||400||900||2000|\n|NIT Calicut||265||500||1000||2400|\n|NIT Bhopal||320||560||1200||2600|\n|NIT Jamshedpur||525||780||1800||3600|\n|NIT Durgapur||470||720||1600||3300|\n|NIT Kurukshetra||545||800||2000||3900|\n|NIT Raipur||649||860||2400||4200|\n|NIT Patna||670||900||4200||7900|\n|NIT Agartala||690||950||4500||8200|\nHow to Verify the NIMCET Cutoff 2025?\nThe NIMCET Cut Off 2025 is anticipated to be made public on the organisation's official website, where all applicants can access it. Candidates can use these steps to view the cut-off marks:\n-\nFirstly, go to the organisation's official website.\n-\nLocate the notification link for the NIMCET Cut Off 2025 marks on the homepage.\n-\nIn step three, click that link. The screen will display the cutoff marks.\n-\nDownload the cut-off PDF file according to its screen display and print it out as needed.\nA 7000 rank falls in the “Poor” band. In practical terms, except for SC/ST candidates (who have their own cutoffs), a 7000 rank in the general category would not secure admission in any NIT. Even for SC/ST, only the very highest close (like NIT Patna’s ST close ~7956) allows anything near rank 7000. All other ST/SC cutoffs were much lower (e.g. Surathkal ST ~4654).\nList of NITs Based on NIMCET 2025 Ranks\nThe following table contains the list of NITs under NIMCET accepting different rank ranges:\n|NIMCET Rank||NIMCET College|\n|List of NITs for 1000 Rank in NIMCET 2025||\n|",
