  "text": "HMGICS launches new Smart Food Lab workshop for kids\nHyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre Singapore (HMGICS) has announced the launch of its Smart Food Lab, a new sensory workshop that is an add-on to its existing complimentary Discovery Tour.\nThe Smart Food Lab workshop invites children aged three to six to embark on a hands-on, sensory-led exploration of food grown in modern, technology-assisted environments, as well as helping children to understand where their food comes from.\nStarting from 21 June 2025, in 60-minute sessions held every Saturday and Sunday from 10:00am to 11:00am and 04:00pm to 05:00pm, children and their accompanying parent or guardian will take part in a series of guided activities exploring food through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.\nParticipants will explore the differences between traditionally grown produce and crops cultivated in HMGICS's high-tech Smart Farm, distinguish different foods by the sounds they make, identify both familiar and new scents, and examine the textures of select crops. The workshop concludes with a fun, interactive Ssam (wrap) making activity using fresh produce from the Smart Farm.\nEach session can accommodate up to eight children, who must each be accompanied by a parent or guardian throughout. This program is chargeable at $15 per child, with proceeds from these workshops donated to the President's Challenge.\nInterested families are encouraged to sign up for the Smart Food Lab workshop via this link. Bookings are encouraged as spaces are limited.\nLooking ahead, the public can also look forward to other exciting initiatives, including a kids' coding workshop featuring a miniature version of SPOT, the four-legged robot developed by Boston Dynamics that HMGICS uses for inspecting assembly quality.\nHyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre Singapore (HMGICS) has announced the launch of its Smart Food Lab, a new sensory workshop that is an add-on to its existing complimentary Discovery Tour.\nThe Smart Food Lab workshop invites children aged three to six to embark on a hands-on, sensory-led exploration of food grown in modern, technology-assisted environments, as well as helping children to understand where their food comes from.\nStarting from 21 June 2025, in 60-minute sessions held every Saturday and Sunday from 10:00am to 11:00am and 04:00pm to 05:00pm, children and their accompanying parent or guardian will take part in a series of guided activities exploring food through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.\nParticipants will explore the differences between traditionally grown produce and crops cultivated in HMGICS's high-tech Smart Farm, distinguish different foods by the sounds they make, identify both familiar and new scents, and examine the textures of select crops.
