The system stores renewable electricity as high-temperature heat in energy dense composite bricks and delivers dispatchable power or industrial-grade heat for up to 24 hours, without lithium, combustion, or fragile supply chains.\nPan-Atlantic University’s main campus consumes approximately 6,570 MWh of electricity annually - much of which is currently supplied by fossil fuel generators. When run on diesel, this equates to over 1.8 million litres per year - or the equivalent of filling nearly three-quarters of an Olympic swimming pool full of diesel, for one site alone.\nInstalled on site, Aed Energy’s system marks the start of a shift from fossil fuel dependency to clean, dispatchable energy charged entirely by renewables. Its MWh-scale units are designed for rapid deployment across industrial sites, microgrids, and critical infrastructure where fossil fuel generators remain the default for primary energy supply.\nThis project is a strategic inflection point for Aed Energy - transitioning the technology from lab-scale development into a live operating environment. It validates the system under real-world conditions and lays the foundation for commercial rollout. As global energy users seek longer-duration alternatives to short-duration battery systems, this deployment will demonstrate how Aed Energy’s platform can deliver clean, reliable baseload power where conventional batteries fall short.\nThe project is already driving positive economic and global impact. In the UK, it has created three new job roles, contributing to Aed Energy’s growth plans to expand to 15 UK jobs by 2026 and more than 150 globally by 2030. In Nigeria, it is generating an estimated 10–15 local jobs during installation and commissioning.\nCommenting on the success of the project, CEO of Aed Energy, Rayan Kassis said: “The Pan Atlantic University Thermal Demonstrator project, funded by the ZE-Gen, is a first step toward proving that affordable, clean baseload energy can be delivered reliably - even in regions still heavily dependent on fossil fuel generators. It moves our technology out of the lab and into the field, showing what’s possible when innovation is paired with local partnerships and real-world demand.”\n“We’re proud to be working with Pan-Atlantic University, FaithLink, ZE-Gen, and Innovate UK to deliver a solution that’s not only practical, but scalable. This deployment lays the foundation for clean energy systems that serve critical institutions, power industrial growth, and open up new export opportunities for UK innovation.”\n– TradeArabia News Service\nRelated posts\nKuwait to host flagship conferences on energy innovation\nABB wins electrical, automation contract for Petrobras FPSO vessels\nADNOC Distribution achieves major ESG milestones\nChevron Lummus, Neste to convert biomass waste to renewable fuels\nGulf Navigation in deal to acquire Brooge Energy assets for $871m\nAdnoc Gas awards $5bn contract for key Abu Dhabi RGD project\nSungrow releases PowerTitan 3.0 energy storage system platform\nArmstrong Fluid Technology launches key new function in platform\nHeisco lands key Kuwait Oil Company contract\nIEA launches new global LNG capacity tracker\nDNO raises $400m in subordinated hybrid bonds\nAutomation key to refinery resilience amid slowing oil demand, says IEA\nScottishPower, MJR and Oasis studies put offshore charging on the horizon\nMOL Group, Socar agreed on terms for Azerbaijan onshore exploration\nRethink the way we produce, use plastics, urges WHO\nKEC International wins key Saudi power project contract\nAbu Dhabi completes gas systems remediation in buildings\nTeledyne GFD partners with IDS to manufacture in Saudi Arabia\nEbara Elliott Energy starts work on new Abu Dhabi facility\nSaudi Electricity Company boosts Hajj grid capacity by 75%\nAD Ports, key firms eye e-methanol bunkering facility in Kezad\nTrojan, Samsung start work on 1,000MW Al Dhafra power plant\n73,000 new homes to be delivered in Dubai this year, says report\nLummus, InnoVent sign tyre pyrolysis technology deal\nBrazil, Irena to co-host first global energy planning summit\nTAQA appoints new Executive VP of Products & Technologies and CTO\nALTÉRRA backs Absolute Energy to develop renewable capacity in Italy\nAdnoc Gas joins MSCI Emerging Market Index\nJubaili Bros, WEA to offer power generation solutions in Southeast Asia\nYokogawa releases next-generation of CENTUM VP integrated production control system",
