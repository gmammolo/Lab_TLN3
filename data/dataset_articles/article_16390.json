During the first semester, students study across Les Roches’ international campuses in Marbella, Crans-Montana, and Abu Dhabi Hospitality Academy – Les Roches engaging in subjects including the global private aviation industry, aviation management systems, luxury client experience, effective communication in aviation and brand ambassador leadership in a lifestyle environment.\nIn the second semester, enrolled students undertake a guaranteed six-month internship with Jetex in the United Arab Emirates and will apply their learning in a real-world private aviation environment in a strategic location known for its world-class infrastructure, and rising volume of private air traffic. After completing the internship, participants may graduate with the in Private Aviation Management or extend their studies by one semester to earn a Master’s of Advanced Studies in Hospitality Management with Specialization from Les Roches.\n“Thanks to Les Roches’ global campus network, this program enables students to live and learn in three top luxury tourism locations: Abu Dhabi-United Arab Emirates, Geneva–Swiss Alps, and Málaga–Costa del Sol,” said Carlos Díez de la Lastra, CEO of Les Roches. “By aligning our curriculum with industry needs, we aim to prepare graduates to seamlessly step into leadership roles. This global immersion not only introduces students to diverse cultures and key markets but also equips them with a comprehensive understanding of international best practices—empowering them to thrive in the increasingly dynamic and competitive global luxury private aviation sector.”\n“At Jetex, we have always been committed to supporting and empowering the next generations. We believe that the unique personalities and skills of Jetex talents are what fuel the very heart of the company’s excellence, entrepreneurship and innovation,” said Adel Mardini, Founder & CEO of Jetex.\nTo apply, candidates must complete an interview with Jetex, hold a university degree, be aged 30 or under and demonstrate an advanced command of English.\nAs with all Les Roches academic programs, this diploma is accredited by the Swiss Federal Government and by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE) in the United States.\nA Growing Industry Ready for Takeoff\nThe private aviation market, valued at $38.5 billion in 2023, is projected to grow to $55.2 billion by 2031, driven by rising demand, efficiency, and ultra-personalized service. In Spain alone, the sector supports over 21,000 jobs and contributes €3.1 billion to GDP.\nAs the global private aviation sector experiences a strong upward trajectory — with the market projected to grow from $28.01 billion in 2024 to $30.08 billion in 2025 — Jetex continues to lead the industry with its innovative approach and commitment to excellence. This growth is fueled by increasing demand for bespoke travel experiences, sustainable aviation solutions, and cutting-edge technology. Jetex, recognized as a global leader in executive private aviation services, is at the forefront of this transformation, operating across 37 private jet terminals across Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and South America.\n– TradeArabia News Service\nRelated posts",
