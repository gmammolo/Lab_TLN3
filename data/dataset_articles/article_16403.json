  "text": "The Calvary Christian College Science Department recently hosted its third successful Endemic Science Expo.\nEndemic in this context means learners identify a problem within a 5km radius of their school and develop a scientific solution using one of the sciences studied at school – earth sciences (geography), biological science (life science), or physical science.\nThis approach helps learners apply their knowledge to real-world issues, demonstrating the practical value of their studies.\nTwo distinguished guests and judges, Professor Oupa Mashile from Unisa and Mary Williams, central regional director of ISASA, were present to interact with learners and provide valuable feedback on their projects.\nLearners demonstrate how their science project works to a guest. The Endemic Science Expo provides budding scientists a platform to showcase their talents and innovations, offering practical solutions to challenges faced by their communities.\nScience teacher and expo organiser, Mr Muleya, said: “This talent would remain hidden unless we provide a platform for these young minds to grow and develop their inquisitiveness. We need to support these young people so their creative ideas do not go to waste but become meaningful solutions.”\nParticipants included young scientists from schools such as St Mary’s (Waverley), Broadacres, and Calvary Christian College itself. Many focused on addressing basic resource needs in informal settlements around Gauteng, such as access to clean water and electricity.\nOarabile Nkabinde from Calvary Christian College and her winning exhibit. The winning project, by Grade Nine learner Oarabile Nkabinde from Calvary Christian College, detailed scientific methods for harvesting and filtering water to make it accessible to communities. The project demonstrated an impressive understanding of the role of science in society, earning well-deserved praise from the school.\nLearners from several schools also attended to view exhibits and exchange ideas with the participants.\nCalvary Christian College expressed heartfelt gratitude to their major sponsors, Voltex and MajorTech, for their generous ongoing support. Thanks were also extended to Mobile Gals and the school’s head boy parents for contributing to the event’s success.\nFor more information or to register for next year’s event, schools can email principal@calvarychristiancollege.co.za .",
