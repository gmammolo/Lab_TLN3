(Photo: VNA)\nThe book chronicles the evolution and growth of Vietnam’s revolutionary press in tandem with key milestones of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the nation’s broader revolutionary path. It showcases historic turning points, achievements, and the silent sacrifices made by generations of revolutionary journalists. Across various periods, the press not only fulfilled its mission of timely and vivid reporting, but also played a pivotal role in ideological education, public opinion shaping, combating disinformation, and raising political awareness among the populace.\nThe photo book \"100 Years of Vietnam’s Revolutionary Press (1925–2025)\". (Photo: VNA)\nThe photo book stands as a profound tribute to the generations of revolutionary journalists in Vietnam, documenting their tireless journey of hardship, resilience, creativity, and dedication.
