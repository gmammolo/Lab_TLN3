  "text": "LANCASTER — Christopher Daley has been captivating audiences across New England for over 30 years with engaging presentations on historical topics. Over the past three years, he has expanded his reach nationally, delivering virtual lectures via Zoom to audiences throughout the United States. His talks have been featured at libraries, historical societies, schools, and various clubs and organizations.\nDaley is excited to present “The History of Emancipation and Juneteenth” from 7 until 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, June 17, at the Thayer Memorial Library, 717 Main St., and the community is welcome.\n“’The History of Emancipation & Juneteenth’ is a 60-minute slide presentation which begins with a short history of the Abolitionist movement from the 1830s through the Civil War,” explained Daley.\nThe discussion will then turn to all the causes of the Civil War and the growing hue and cry for the end of slavery.\nAdditionally, the election of Abraham Lincoln will be examined spotlighting his views on slavery and African Americans. Through the course of the talk, you will also see a revealing view on how his ideas and opinions evolved over time.\n“The second part of the presentation we will look at some of the events that led up to The Emancipation Proclamation,” Daley said. “Such as Freemont’s Emancipation, Hunter’s Emancipation, and General Benjamin Butler’s orders on ‘Contraband of War’.”\nThen, it will turn to the Emancipation Proclamation itself; the timing of it, the politics of it, and who was actually freed by it.\nThe third part of the presentation will focus on the gradual emancipation of slaves by Federal Troops as they conquered the different Confederate states, the end of the war, the movement of troops into Texas, and the famous issuing of General Order No. 3 on June 19, 1865, at Galveston, Texas, and how the news spread through Texas and the reaction of the slaves to tidings of freedom.\n“The final part of the talk will showcase how Juneteenth went from a local Galveston celebration to a national holiday,” Daley added.\nDaley holds both a B.A. and an M.A. in Political Science and History from Bridgewater State University. He has held several notable positions in the field of history, including serving as President of the Pembroke Historical Society and Chairman of the Pembroke Historical Commission.\nAdditionally, he worked as a docent and Coordinator of Educational Outreach at the John Alden House Historic Site. After a 25-year career teaching history at the Silver Lake Regional School System in Kingston, Daley recently retired to focus on his historical endeavors.\nAs a writer, Daley has contributed numerous articles on diverse historical topics to local publications and authored the book “Murder and Mayhem in Boston: Historic Crimes in the Hub”.\nHis expertise has also been sought for television, including serving as a historical consultant on the Sacco-Vanzetti case for the Travel Channel’s Time Traveling with Brian Unger and appearing as a historian in two episodes of Kindred Spirits focusing on the Lizzie Borden case.\n“I enjoy giving these presentations because it allows me to share topics I’m passionate about with others who share my interests,” Daley said.\nThis program is suitable for ages 10 and up.
