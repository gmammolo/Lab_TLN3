  "text": "For Immediate Release\nJune 12, 2025\nPRESS RELEASE\nThe United States and Mongolia Open the Center of Excellence for English Language Teaching in Ulaanbaatar\nOn June 12, representatives from the Government of Mongolia, the U.S. Embassy, and representatives of the diplomatic corps and international organizations, participated in the formal opening ceremony of the Center of Excellence for English Language Teaching, which is a joint partnership between the U.S. government, the Mongolian government, the National University of Mongolia, and other partners, including diplomatic missions and select companies.\nThe Center of Excellence for English Language Teaching is a key part of the U.S.-Mongolia Excellence in English Initiative. Since its soft opening in March, the Center has hosted an array of programs conducted by English Language Fellows, Fulbright English Teaching Assistants, Peace Corps volunteers, and other educators.\n“Establishing the Center of Excellence marks a significant milestone in our shared commitment to advancing education and fostering professional development for English teachers across Mongolia,” U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia Richard Buangan said in remarks delivered at the National University of Mongolia on June 12. “This Center will serve as a hub for innovation, learning, and growth, providing invaluable resources and opportunities for Mongolian educators to enhance their skills and knowledge.”\nThe U.S. embassy supports a range of English language programs across Mongolia. These include the English Access Microscholarship Program, an after-school program for high school students that currently has 200 participants, and three U.S. English Language Fellows and seven Fulbright English Teaching Assistants, who work at local schools and colleges across the country.\nFor more information, please contact the U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Section:\npaspress@usembassy.mn |+976 7007-6001",
