He did not compete last winter for the Cowboys.\nWells was a four-time Minnesota state champion who most recently competed for the Golden Gophers. He twice before qualified for the NCAA Championships, going 2-2 last season.\nAt Princeton High School, Wells went 162-1, finishing unbeaten as a freshman, junior and senior.\nThe remaining members of the transfer class include Jack Gioffre, Peyten Kellar, Rafael Hipolito Jr. and Brian Soldano.
