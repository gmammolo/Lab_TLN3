  "text": "The Ministry of Labour and Employment proudly highlights the exceptional achievements of the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Medical College and Hospital, and Super Specialty Hospital located at Sanath Nagar, Hyderabad. Established on a built-up area of 21 acres with an additional 11 acres earmarked for expansion, the campus stands as a testament to the Government of India’s commitment to affordable, accessible, and high-quality healthcare for the working class and their families.\nServing over 72.6 lakh Insured Persons (IPs) and their beneficiaries, the Sanath Nagar campus has become a national benchmark in healthcare delivery, education, and technology integration. With 1,044 total beds, including 159 ICU beds, 45 dialysis beds, 10 modular operation theatres, and 5 advanced OT suites, it ensures compassionate, collaborative, and patient-centric care. The institution maintains an OPD load of 3,200+ patients daily, with 200+ admissions across departments—making it one of the most active healthcare hubs in the ESIC network.\nThe twin hospitals on campus have been consistently awarded the title of Best Performing ESIC Hospital in the category of More than 500 Beds since 2019. Accredited with NABH (Hospital & Blood Bank), NABL Entry Level, and ISO certifications, this campus has emerged as a change leader in public health administration.\nIts medical expertise spans a wide range of super specialties. In Cardiology and CTVS, the campus performs complex procedures including TAVI/TAVR, CABG, device closures, and interventional electrophysiology. In Nephrology and Urology, it offers 24x7 dialysis and both live and cadaveric kidney transplants. The Neurology and Neuro-surgery department performs advanced procedures such as awake craniotomies, stereotactic biopsies, and intra-operative neuro-monitoring. Departments like Paediatric Surgery, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, and Oncology provide high-end interventions with mortality rates lower than national benchmarks. The Hematology department has successfully undertaken bone marrow transplants, while fully-equipped Cardiac and Neuro-rehabilitation units in the PMR department ensure post-operative recovery and care. Emergency services are functional 24x7.\nAdvanced diagnostic and laboratory services complement clinical care. The campus has implemented IT-based solutions like Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and a Laboratory Information System integrated with Dhanwantri HER, enabling real-time, paperless, and efficient diagnostics. Tests including Immuno-Histochemistry, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and PCR are routinely performed, especially for oncology cases.\nDriven by evidence-based protocols and a strong culture of quality assurance, the hospital’s administration ensures strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs) across infection control, medication safety, fall prevention, and patient identification. A dedicated grievance redressal mechanism, regular staff training, and continuous quality improvement initiatives are in place to maintain high standards of service.\nSanath Nagar has also pioneered IT-enabled patient services, including Home Drug Delivery, Home Sample Collection, Online Consultation through the AAA+ App, and 5G-enabled ambulances, setting a new bar in public health innovation and outreach.\nIn the field of medical education, the campus nurtures over 125 MBBS, 83 MD/MS, 15 MCh, 12 DrNB, and 72 paramedical students across broad and super-specialty departments, along with 25 AFIH trainees per batch. The institute provides a rich academic ecosystem with digital libraries, modern laboratories, skill labs, simulation-based training, and lectures by eminent faculty. It upholds the ESIC’s four foundational pillars: Learning and Teaching; Industry and Society Engagement; Research and Knowledge Transfer; and Leadership with Good Governance.\nThis vibrant, high-performing campus is not only an engine of public health service delivery but also a cradle of future medical leaders. With its ongoing expansion and continued focus on technology, skill-building, and patient care, ESIC Sanath Nagar is poised to evolve as a national Centre of Excellence in public healthcare and medical education.",
