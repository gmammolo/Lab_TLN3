  "text": "(Colonial Williamsburg Foundation) WILLIAMSBURG — Neil Handa from Henley Middle School in Crozet was named the first-place winner at the 2025 National Civics Bee Virginia State Finals competition hosted June 7 by The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation at the Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg.\nHanda advances to compete against finalists from across the country at the National Civics Bee in Washington, D.C., Nov. 10-11.\nYousef Kiani from J. Lupton Simpson Middle School in Leesburg placed second, and Arianna McBride from Andrew Lewis Middle School in Salem placed third.\nAccording to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Civics Bee is an annual competition designed to inspire young Americans to engage in civics and contribute to their communities. A nonpartisan initiative of The Civic Trust of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation , it aims to enhance civic literacy, skills, and participation among students in 6th, 7th and 8th grades in participating states across the country.\nTo compete, middle school students submit an essay identifying issues within their community and solutions on how to solve them based on civic principles, according to the foundation. During the state finals, the students participated in three rounds of competition, including two live quiz events with questions on the U.S. Constitution, presented a summary of their essays, and answered questions from judges to test their knowledge.\n“It’s incredibly heartening to see young people embrace their responsibility to be civically engaged,” said Cliff Fleet, president and CEO of The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. “The example set by Neil and his fellow competitors here in Williamsburg, where the ideals that shaped American democracy were debated over 250 years ago, should inspire all of us to be more active and informed citizens.”\nThe Colonial Williamsburg Foundation said that the Commonwealth’s involvement in the National Civics Bee is one of the many 2026 initiatives of the VA250 Education Steering Committee , led by Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera in partnership with the Virginia American Revolution 250 Commission and the Virginia Department of Education. These initiatives are designed to bring history to life, spark a civics renaissance, and celebrate democracy in the months leading up to America’s 250th anniversary, it added.\n“This event exemplifies the spirit of VA250 — educating, engaging, and inspiring the next generation,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, Vice Chair of the VA250 Commission. “This commemoration is as much about the future as it is about the past, and these students are shaping our future by demonstrating the knowledge, curiosity and civic engagement our democracy requires.”\nFourteen students advanced to the state competition as the top finalists in Civics Bee competitions that were held in April by the Greater Augusta Regional Chamber of Commerce, the Halifax County Chamber of Commerce, the Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce, the Louisa County Chamber of Commerce and the Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce Foundation.\n“We are so proud of the students who came together this weekend from across the state,” said Secretary Guidera. “These students bring to the state and national stage what Gov. Youngkin’s history and social science standards bring to the classroom … enthusiasm for civics and civic mindedness, and the inspiration to be more engaged citizens.”\nSecretary Guidera was a judge at this year’s state competition alongside Cathie Vick, President and CEO of the Virginia Chamber, and Rachel Williams, Civics Educator with the John Marshall Center for Constitutional History and Civics. Kurt Smith, who portrays Colonial Williamsburg Nation Builder Thomas Jefferson, served as emcee.\nMiddle School students from public, private, charter, and homeschools are invited to apply to the 2026 National Civics Bee using resources that will continue to populate here .
