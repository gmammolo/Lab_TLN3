  "text": "Germany sees 35% rise in Indian student interest amid global visa issues\nAs visa delays and scrutiny grow in countries like the US, Germany is emerging as a stable and welcoming alternative for Indian students. With a 35% surge in applications, officials highlight the country's transparent, affordable, and student-friendly education system.\nIn Short\n- Germany sees 35% rise in Indian student applications\n- Around 50,000 Indians study in Germany, a top five destination\n- German universities mostly have no or low tuition fees\nAs visa hurdles mount in countries like the US and UK, Germany is emerging as a preferred destination for Indian students seeking a secure and transparent academic path. Citing a sharp 35% increase in applications from India, German officials have reiterated their country’s commitment to providing a stable, inclusive environment for international learners.\nAt a recent press briefing in New Delhi, German Ambassador Dr Philipp Ackermann said, “In the context of the difficulties Indian students face in other countries, we have seen a sharp rise in interest for German universities and research institutions. Applications have increased by over 35 per cent in the last couple of months.”\nCurrently, around 50,000 Indian students are enrolled at German universities, placing the country amongst the top five destinations for Indian learners, after the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\nReinforcing Germany’s consistent and transparent approach to education, the ambassador remarked, “We are a very reliable partner. When it comes to studying or researching in Germany, we don't check your social media before you arrive.” This remark appeared to subtly contrast Germany’s stance with the increasingly strict vetting processes being adopted by other nations.\nA key draw for students is the affordability of education in Germany. Most public universities either charge no tuition fees or have very minimal costs compared to their Western counterparts. “We believe education is a public good, not a business opportunity,” Ambassador Ackermann added.\nDr Katja Lasch, Director of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Regional Office in New Delhi, also addressed students and urged them not to rely on private agents for applications. “Most public universities in Germany do not work with agents. Our system is transparent and accessible. Students can get free counselling from DAAD and German university liaison offices in India,” she said.\nGermany currently offers more than 2,300 English-taught programmes, covering a wide range of fields including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where the country faces a growing demand for skilled professionals.\nAmbassador Ackermann noted, “We are looking for the smartest, most dedicated students—those who are eager to contribute and grow. And we see that in Indian students.”\nHe also highlighted post-study benefits, including an 18-month stay-back period for job searching and simplified processes for residence permit extension once employment is secured.\nPositioning itself as a dependable academic partner during a time of uncertainty in global higher education, Germany’s message is clear: Indian students are welcome, valued, and supported. \"Germany is very eager and happy to welcome Indian students. In these turbulent times, we offer not just world-class education but also a stable, inclusive, and trustworthy system,” Ackermann concluded.\n(With ANI inputs)",
