  "text": "By Professor Ramneek Ahluwalia\nIn a country where young people are often seen as the leaders of tomorrow, we must ask ourselves: are we truly preparing them for the complex challenges of today and the uncertainties of the future?\nSouth Africa’s young people, whether in school, post-school education and training, or out of the education system altogether, face a multitude of challenges. Gender-based violence (GBV), mental health issues, drug, alcohol and substance abuse, HIV, unplanned pregnancies, digital exclusion, and unemployment are just a few of the pressing issues. At the heart of these challenges is a lack of soft skills and civic values essential for young people to navigate the world, secure meaningful employment, and contribute to the fabric of a democratic society.\nThis is why Higher Health has launched a groundbreaking Civic and Soft Skills NQF Level 5 QCTO qualification – the first of its kind in Africa, developed in partnership with UNESCO. This pioneering programme equips young South Africans with essential civic values, Skills4Life, and workplace readiness competencies. It is a skills revolution designed to build resilience, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, empathy, teamwork, leadership, time management, goal setting, conflict resolution, entrepreneurship, and more – the very top 10 soft skills recognised globally for workplace success.\nThe evidence is compelling: 85% of job success is attributed to soft skills. Yet these skills are not innate; they must be cultivated. By embedding them across our education and training systems, we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, capable, and empowered generation – one that will shape the future of South Africa.\nIn any job interview, employers are always looking for the right attitude. In fact, it’s often in the back of their minds that while specific skills can be developed on the job, it’s the individual’s attitude that truly matters. Attitude plays a major role in securing employment and opening up opportunities. The Higher Health Civic and Soft Skills programme focuses on shaping this very attitude for the world of work – making it a critical enabler for employment success.\nOur country’s democracy depends on it. A disengaged youth population, one that has lost faith in the political process and abstains from voting, threatens the very foundation of our democratic society. Civic education, saving our democracy, making young people to vote, respect for the Constitution, peer leadership, patriotism and volunteerism must be revitalised.\nThe statistics are alarming. Research shows that 1 in 3 young South African women, before the age of 21, have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence. Mental health challenges are also stark, with 1 in 4 young people in post-school education and training struggling with mental health issues. These two crises\nare intertwined: those suffering from GBV are vulnerable to mental health challenges, while untreated mental health issues can lead to vulnerability to GBV, either as victims or perpetrators.\nAdd to this the persistent crisis of substance abuse, with 65% of GBV cases in South Africa preceded by drug and alcohol use, according to the World Health Organisation. Unplanned and teenage pregnancies further compound the challenges, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services.\nDisability inclusion is another key area of focus. According to Stats SA, 5.5% of our population comprises persons with disabilities. We must ensure they have access to skills development, fair opportunities, and reasonable accommodation so they can contribute meaningfully to society. It is an important critical focus.\nClimate change is an emerging priority, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity. New green jobs are arising in sectors like the hydrogen and blue economies, and young people must be prepared to engage in these future-facing industries.\nDigital literacy and ethics of AI are other critical issues. As an important pillar of UNESCO, these are essential enablers for participation in a rapidly evolving digital world.\nBut there is hope. Our Civic and Soft Skills programme is not just about knowledge; it’s about empowerment. It’s about equipping young people with financial literacy, digital literacy, and even ethics of AI to thrive in a rapidly changing digital world. With modules on climate action, disability inclusion, and gender studies – including UNESCO’s Transforming MEN’talities initiative – we are preparing our youth to be agents of positive change, driving both personal and national economic growth.\nThis groundbreaking skills qualification is eligible to any young South African who has a Grade 9 equivalent to NQF L1 with the exit outcomes of NQF L5 accredited through the QCTO.\nThis programme is built around a blended learning model accessible via mobile phone, tablet or computer – making it available to young people across our country, including in rural and under-resourced communities for digitally poor South Africans. We have established computer labs in collaboration with churches, TVET Colleges, and Universities to provide training and digital skills development for young people.\nWe are proud to report that while the blended learning programme only commenced recently, over 5,000 young people have already graduated, and we aspire to reach another 250,000 more young South Africans building these essential Civic and Soft Skills. This is the only skills qualification programme in Africa that is taking the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations to the common young people – is not just a promise, but a reality. A movement where we are using computer labs in rural areas and peri-urban campuses nationwide, building digital literacy, which is accredited and ensures that no young person is left behind in the digital era. It is a fully digital programme used to build the future of South Africa.\nAs we look to the future, we must recognise that 30% of jobs will come from social entrepreneurship if we invest in nurturing leadership and entrepreneurial skills. We must also embrace the opportunities emerging from the green economy, the hydrogen economy, and the blue economy. Climate change is not just a challenge – it’s a call to action, and our youth must be ready to lead.\nSouth Africa’s young people deserve a future where they are not just survivors, but thriving, active citizens. A future where they have the tools to tackle GBV, mental health challenges, addiction, and economic exclusion. A future where they can innovate, lead, and transform their communities.\nThis is why we must prioritise soft skills training. It is not optional – it is essential. Let us build a generation of resilient, capable, and empowered young South Africans who can drive change, build our democracy, and secure a brighter future for us all.\nProfessor Ramneek Ahluwalia is the CEO of Higher Health",
