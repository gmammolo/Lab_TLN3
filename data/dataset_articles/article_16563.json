  "text": "Lind-Ritzville seniors ready to face the world\nRITZVILLE — The Lind-Ritzville Class of 2025 has made it.\n“Today, we're walking across the stage in wizard hats, holding diplomas that prove we endured through it all: the chaos, the cramming and the laughter and all the growing pains that came with high school,” said salutatorian Temple Gefre.\nTwo by two, the 34 members of the Class of 2025 processed into the Gilson Gym on Saturday to the high school band’s strains of “Pomp and Circumstance.” As is LRHS custom, the procession was led by the junior class marshals, Zoe Galbreath and Beau Fode.\nLRHS Principal Kevin Terris started by reading a list of accomplishments of members of the class of 2025. Some, like participating in Future Farmers of America or performing in the school band, were fairly general.\nOthers were very specific.\n“If you finished in seventh place at the WIAA state track competition 200-meter run with a time of 22.79, please stand,” Terris said.\nThe class had nine valedictorians, of whom five spoke at the ceremony. Camden Shaver took the podium first.\n“I wasn't going to do a speech here today until one of my closest friends said to me, ‘I've never seen a brown person on that stage in a long time,’” she said. “And as silly and bold as that sounds, it truly hit … Whether your skin is brown, yellow or purple, whether your hair doesn't ‘behave,’ your background is different, or your identity or expression doesn't match what people expect, you are not too much. You are more than enough.”\nEmilia Klewin attended classes at Eastern Washington University and participated in ROTC there while finishing up at LRHS, an experience that brought some lessons home to her. Brody Boness’ high school years were marked with adversity through major sports injuries, he said, which taught him the value of perseverance. Alyssa Williams discussed overcoming her competitive nature to learn that comparison is the killer of joy, and Addy Colbert spoke of learning not to be so eager for the next stage of life that you miss out on the current one.\nThe Class of 2025, collectively, was awarded more than $1 million in scholarships, School Counselor Kayla Walker said. Additionally, a few students were singled out for special recognition. Fredy Granados-Lopez and Liz Cruz earned the Washington State Seal of Biliteracy in Spanish. Granados-Lopez also received The Harry P. Hayes Award. The Honor Cup went to Claire Wellsandt.\nThe guest speaker was former Gonzaga basketball star Mike Nilson, who spoke about the importance of commitment. Final words before the diplomas were awarded came from senior Brix Curtis, chosen by his peers to deliver the closing address. Curtis was not an especially distinguished student or an impressive athlete, he said, but his class’s achievements weren’t about those things.\n“The best part about my class is that at their core, they're all good, kind people and to me, that is what matters,” he said. “As far back as I can remember, my class has always been in constant competition, not to be better than each other, but to better ourselves as a collective. We have nine valedictorians for a reason … We all did these things not to impress ourselves, but because we were all surrounded by impressive people, people who lift each other up and show each other it’s possible to do great things once again.”",
