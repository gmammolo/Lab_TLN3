  "text": "MLSD celebrates inaugural graduation of Digital Learning Center\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake School District marked a historic milestone May 4, as the Digital Learning Center proudly held its inaugural graduation ceremony at Lions Field. The school has had two other graduating classes, but they have been previously combined with Moses Lake High School.\nThe event celebrated the academic achievements of the first graduating class, comprising a diverse group of students who had successfully completed their high school education through innovative digital learning methods.\nAttended by family, friends, educators and community members, the ceremony featured heartfelt speeches, reflections on personal growth, and acknowledgments of the challenges faced throughout the academic year.\n“Your accomplishment marks not only a personal achievement but also the promise of a new beginning,” said Superintendent Carol Lewis during her opening remarks, emphasizing the importance of community support and perseverance throughout the students’ educational journeys.\nThe evening was a tribute to the faculty and staff who guided the graduates over the years, particularly during a challenging final year. Lewis acknowledged the steadfast dedication of counselors and faculty members.\n“Without their belief in your potential and their unwavering support, this graduation would not have been possible,” she said.\nKeynote speaker Veronica “Ronnie” Roylance, a staff member known for her caring approach to students, shared insights about personal growth and resilience. In a candid address, she addressed the common uncertainties faced by graduates regarding their future paths.\n“It’s perfectly normal to feel unsure about your next steps. Remember that life is not a race; it’s a journey filled with valuable lessons,” she said, encouraging students to embrace their unique paths with confidence.\nThe ceremony also highlighted the achievements of students who participated in various programs, including the Seal of Biliteracy, Running Start and vocational training initiatives.\nAs graduates were called to the stage to receive their diplomas, applause erupted from the audience, reflecting pride and encouragement.\nIn closing, Lewis commended the graduates for their resilience and echoed the sentiments of unity within the community.\n“Together, we celebrate not just your graduation, but the bonds formed and memories created here at the Digital Learning Center,” she said.\nAfter the ceremony, graduates exited the field in celebration, ready to embark on their next adventures as proud representatives of their school and community.",
