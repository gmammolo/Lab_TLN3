  "text": "Othello graduation caps off years of students’ hard work\nOTHELLO – Camaraderie and cheer were in the air as the Class of 2025 took the field at Othello High School for their graduation ceremony, a momentous occasion that many expressed they worked hard to reach. Co-valedictorian Natalie Cerrillo had a fitting way to describe the event’s significance.\n“We all have one thing in common ... today,” she said.\nThe events opened with the traditional “Pomp and Circumstance” playing over the speakers as 328 seniors walked out onto the field. In groups of four, they gradually made their way from behind the stands through center field and to the bleachers set up at the 50-yard line.\nKathryn Acheson, Othello High School’s principal, opened the ceremony with congratulations to the seniors and parents for reaching this point. She first welcomed Cerrillo for her speech and took a photo with her family. After she spoke, Acheson welcomed co-valedictorian Claire Gilbert for her speech and family photo.\nThey both spoke in similar tones of achievement and pride in what this day meant, the culmination of early mornings, late nights studying, athletics and other extracurriculars.\n“I’ve stayed up late so many nights, and I’ve spent a lot of time asking my parents and my friends for advice and help with my assignments when I don’t know how to do them and stuff like that,” Gilbert said.\nElizabeth De Jesus Flores from Desert Oasis High School also spoke and praised her peers, teachers and family for helping her throughout high school. She dedicated her success in high school and graduation to her parents, who were huge motivators for her throughout high school.\nStudent Body President Riley Rodriguez was up next to speak, but not before being welcomed with cheers and chants from his peers. Rodriguez was emotional throughout his speech, often holding back tears when thanking family and friends for their support during his high school career.\nHe thanked his teachers for making Othello High School a second home for him and pushing him to be the best version of himself.\n“This is such a surreal moment for me, and a huge milestone,” he said. “I’m a first-gen with my family. They’ve done so many things for me; they pushed me so hard, they made me, they took me everywhere, took me to study, took me to everything, gave me everything, gave me everything I could have in life.”\nRodriguez said he did not remember most of his speech because of how emotional he was. After his speech, he was welcomed back to the stage twice more to accept two awards for student activity and service.\nFrom there, the presentation of diplomas began. Students formed two lines and administrators began announcing their names. Most students made their walk brief with a handshake and a quick photo. Other students had more fun with their walk; after receiving their diploma, one student stepped onto the grass and did a celebratory backflip.\nParents flooded the aisles to get good photos of their kids, and many cheers and chants rained throughout the ceremony. Once the names were read through, and students returned to their seats, Acheson led her students into the traditional turning of the tassel.\nCongratulations rang out and the Class of 2025 tossed their caps in the air. Students and parents gathered on the field after the ceremony to embrace and take photos.",
