  "text": "About 220 graduating seniors of Newton College and Career Academy took a bold step toward adulthood recently by participating in the “Navigating Through Life” program — a dynamic, hands-on event designed to equip students with essential life skills on May 9.\nOrganized by the UGA Archway Partnership’s education and workforce development work group, the event brought together a coalition of community partners, including Newton County 4-H, Newton Community Partnership, Emory at Oxford College, Georgia State University Perimeter College, Georgia Piedmont Technical College and Newton County School System. The initiative was born from a community-identified need to better prepare students for life beyond high school.",
