  "text": "MLHS Class of 2025 steps out into the world\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake High School Class of 2025 celebrated a milestone Tuesday evening as 386 graduates participated in the commencement ceremony held at the school’s stadium.\nThe air was filled with excitement and pride as families and friends gathered to honor the achievements of the graduating class, marking the completion of their high school journey.\nPrincipal Sheila Kries opened the ceremony, reflecting on the unique challenges faced by students over the past few years, particularly during the pandemic.\n“When you arrived at Moses Lake High School as ninth graders, I was your assistant principal,” she said. “I fondly recall interacting with you and the memorable chaos that ensued as the school reopened post-COVID.”\nHer remarks served as a reminder of the resilience and adaptability the students demonstrated throughout their high school years.\nThe commencement featured two student speakers, Julia Heaps and Hayden Meek, who shared their reflections and experiences. Heaps, an accomplished student set to attend Columbia University, emphasized the importance of seeing beyond stereotypes.\n“Don’t settle for a single story, not about people, not about places and not about yourself,” she urged her classmates. “Be curious, not judgmental.”\nHayden Meek, acknowledging the challenges the class faced in their senior year, paid tribute to the support systems that helped the students persevere.\n“I also want to thank my closest friends who helped me with this speech,” he said. “Reach out, whether you’re grieving a loss or just not feeling like yourself. You’re not alone. Everyone goes through hard times.”\nSuperintendent Carol Lewis reinforced the significance of graduation.\n“This accomplishment is the beginning of an opportunity for you to go out into communities near and far to share your amazing talents,” Lewis said.\nShe expressed gratitude for the staff and community members who supported the students, especially during the school’s financial challenges last year.\nAs the 79th graduating class of Moses Lake High School, the Class of 2025 now steps into a world filled with possibilities, leaving behind cherished memories and embracing new opportunities to thrive in their future endeavors.",
