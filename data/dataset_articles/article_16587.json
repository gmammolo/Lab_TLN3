  "text": "Google Classroom launched new analytics and student-engagement features for schools subscribing to Education Plus. Educators can now access an Analytics tab on any class page and view targeted alerts on student progress. These include notices like “3 students’ grades rose by over 25% since last month” or warnings when multiple assignments are late.\nOn the Classwork page, teachers will spot a count showing how many students haven’t opened attached Drive files. This tackles a common challenge: determining whether no submissions mean struggle or forgetfulness. With this signal, teachers can follow up individually or send class-wide reminders .\nAdmin rollouts follow a phased schedule. Student engagement metrics are active now. The Analytics tab appears on class pages by June?30, and the full set of alerts will reach all Education Plus domains by August?1 . However, access requires a Google Workspace for Education Plus license. Super admins automatically see analytics; they must grant access to other education leaders or staff .\nOther recent Google news –\nThe updates build on Classroom’s centralized dashboard, introduced in 2023. Instructors can now act faster. For example, if a student scores below 70% or a deadline looms and no one has begun an assignment, the system flags it. Teachers can intervene early. Insights appear based on performance issues or assignment timing .\nSuper admins and designated staff can temporarily access any class to view analytics or support teachers. This helps during substitute teaching or intervention .\nThese tools aim to reduce guesswork. Rather than relying on end-of-week grading, teachers can spot disengagement, unopened files, late submissions, and declining performance in real time. The rapid-release and scheduled-release rollout ensures districts see these features gradually. The Analytics tab reaches users by June?30, with full insights available by August?1.\nBy tightly integrating engagement tracking and alerts into Classroom, Google gives educators tools to respond quickly. This could improve outcomes and reduce last-minute catchups. The enhancements roll out over the summer to Google Workspace for Education Plus domains.\nYou may also be interested to read –",
