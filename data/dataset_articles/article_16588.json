  "text": "Memories, gratitude at Quincy graduation ceremony\nQUINCY — Class speaker and Quincy High School teacher Wade Petersen had some praise and some advice for the QHS Class of 2025.\n“You didn’t just buy through high school, you slayed it,” Petersen told the seniors. “You became young adults, ready to skibidi your way into the real world.”\nIt won’t always be easy, though, Petersen said.\n“Whatever you choose, know this. Life’s not always going to be a dub. You’re going to take some L’s along the way,” he said.\nAfter high school, it will be up to each graduate to decide what his or her life is going to be, he said.\n“Just remember as you go into the world, don’t be an NPC, be the main character,” he said.\nValedictorian Jennifer Garcia Lerena said her classmates had been talking about graduation for years, but she remembered how it all started.\n“I’m reminded of the first time I ever stepped into a classroom, with a backpack that seemed to be bigger than me and a dream that seemed so far out of reach,” she said.\nGraduation was a day to celebrate academic achievement, Garcia Lerena said, but it was more than that.\n“It’s about what each one of us has overcome to get here,” she said.\nHer own family’s story is an example, she said – her parents came to a new country to give themselves and their children a better chance.\n“You taught me the true meaning of hard work and what it takes to work for what I want. When I walk across the stage, I won’t be walking just for myself but for my parents and for anyone who sacrificed their chance to finish high school,” Garcia Lerena said.\nSalutatorian Denise Ramirez also talked about the past and the mix of excitement and apprehension of starting kindergarten.\n“Today, that is exactly what we are going through again; feelings and excitement and anxiety fill us as we carry on,” she said.\nHer classmates put in the work and should be proud of what they accomplished, she said.\n“My journey hasn’t been an easy one, and I’m sure some of you can relate,” Ramirez said.\nThe challenge doesn’t end with high school, she said.\n“Change is challenging, but it is the only way we will grow,” Ramirez said.\nPetersen had a few last words for the Class of 2025.\n“Most importantly, you ate. No crumbs left,” Petersen said.",
