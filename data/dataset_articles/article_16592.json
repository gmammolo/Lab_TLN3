  "text": "ACH Warriors celebrate accomplishments at commencement\nCOULEE CITY – Last Saturday marked the end of an era at Almira/Coulee-Hartline High School for the Class of 2025 as they graduated from high school and head into their futures.\n“We gather not just to celebrate accomplishments, but to recognize the journey, the growth and the spirit of perseverance that brought each one of the graduates here today,” said senior class Vice President William Allsbrook.\nACH High School principal Kelley Boyd said this year’s theme for her words of wisdom speech to the Class of 2025 came from a conversation with the class valedictorian on self-motivation that spread around the class as a running joke.\n“Safe to say motivation was really never in question, but the more I thought about it the more I realized, this whole class has shown us what true self-motivation looks like,” she said. “Every single one of you sitting here today has faced your own set of barriers, any yet you showed up, you put in the work, and you got here.”\nThe class valedictorian, Grayson Beal, thanked all the staff, parents and anyone else involved in their support in getting the Class of 2025 where they needed to be, giving a special thanks to Boyd and Jennifer Goetz for their efforts in getting each of them onto the graduation stage.\nBeal said his love for playing sports in high school was his greatest motivation for showing up and aiming to excel in the classroom.\n“As most people here in attendance know, we came up just short multiple times,” said Beal. “In the past, I thought that would be devastating, but over the course of these not-so-storybook endings, I realized that is not the case. While sports were amazing and a great time of my life, they were only a small portion. I have so much left in store, so much more to achieve when sports are over for me.”\nBeal moved to the area in eighth grade from Everett and said it was a big change moving into a smaller community.\n“It was a new sense of community and really shaped me into who I am and I’m so grateful for it,” he said.\nAssociated Student Body President Emma Whitaker and ASB Treasurer Carter Pitts shared the honor of giving the Salutatorian speech as they both earned the title this year.\n“I couldn’t be more grateful to share this with one of my closest friends,” said Whitaker.\nThe two said that one of the greatest parts of their high school experience was the time they got to spend with their classmates. Everyone in the Class of 2025 pushed each other toward success and supported one another through everything.\n“Our class dynamic is one of the most diverse, but also one of the most united,” said Pitts.\nDuring the ceremony, the class took a moment to honor the memory of their classmate, Blake Wallace-Alberto Escalera, who passed away last fall. Boyd said that Escalera had a major impact on the lives of all the students who attended the school throughout his time there and participated in school activities in any way that he could.\n“He just was a fun kid to have around,” said Boyd. “He always had some health things, and we were really hoping that he would be here today.”\nACH senior class president Jeremy Pinar gave the farewell speech for the ceremony, where he reminisced on the journey that brought them all to this point.\n“I’ve gone through my entire K-12 education in the same ACH school system, I’ve lived in the same house outside of Almira my whole life, I know nothing but the feeling of growing up in a small, close-knit community,” said Pinar. “Yet I can wholeheartedly say that I would never trade it for anything else.”",
