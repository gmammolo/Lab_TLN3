  "text": "MEA Local Council awards scholarships\nESCANABA — The 17B Coordinating Council of the Michigan Education Association (MEA) recently awarded a pair of $250 scholarships to two local students. This year’s recipients were Bella Chaney, Carney-Nadeau High School, and Blake Mason, Manistique High School.\nRanked first in her graduating class with a 4.0 GPA, Bella is an aspiring high school English teacher who is deeply passionate about reading and writing. She hopes to inspire students by starting a book club for middle and high schoolers to foster a love for literature and encourage reading as a fulfilling hobby. Bella is also a member of her school’s FIRST robotics team. She will pursue her secondary education degree at Northern Michigan University in the fall.\nBlake, who is dual enrolled at Bay College, carries a 4.12 GPA and is ranked fifth in his class. He consistently earns honor roll recognition and is a member of the National Honor Society. Blake is also a multi-sport athlete, competing on the cross country and basketball teams and earning Academic All-State honors. He serves on the Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) and works part-time as a landscaper. Blake plans to pursue a degree in cybersecurity at Central Michigan University.\nThe 17B Council is the MEA’s local Union affiliate. To be eligible for the monetary award, funded entirely by local dues allocation, a student must be the child or dependent of an active MEA Union member in good standing. Bella is the daughter of Andrea Chaney, a member of the Carney-Nadeau Education Association. Blake’s mother, Alyssa Mason, is a member of the Manistique Education Association.",
