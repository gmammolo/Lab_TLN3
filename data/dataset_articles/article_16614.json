  "text": "The learners of Summerhill Prep School were taught to empathise and understand children living with disabilities and the challenges they face daily.\nAccording to the principal, Cheryl Calmeyer, their art teacher, Megan McQueen, told them about Esjay Sports (a South African Sports clothing brand). Esjay Sports recently partnered with a school in KZN for learners with severe disabilities. Those children painted wonderful abstract art using their feet or mouths. Their works are now printed on one of Esjay’s clothing lines.\nOur Grade Threes were challenged to tuck their arms inside their shirts and paint a picture using their foot or mouth. The children found it a huge challenge, but they loved it.\n“Pushing boundaries, creating, and developing empathy for the disabled in our country were such valuable lessons learnt today. Well done to Esjay Sports for what they do in South Africa,” Calmeyer said.\nAs the school supports kids living with disabilities, she called on their parents to send them to school. “This would unleash their potential and teach others not to discriminate against them. They must be given equal opportunities,” Calmeyer concluded.",
