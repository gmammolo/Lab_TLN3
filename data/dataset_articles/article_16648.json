  "text": "Royal Knights prepared to face the future\nROYAL CITY — The Royal High School Class of 2025 can face anything together, Class President Aaliyah Guerrero told them at graduation Friday.\n“It seems like just yesterday we were all playing during recess,” she said. “Some of us were on the monkey bars, others played on the big tires, and then we had the ankle-biters who spent their recess on the red dots. I might have been one of those ankle-biters. But during it all … we learned to be more than just friends. We learned how to be present when it matters. Each of us faced battles that no one else fought. But here we are, not because we conquered classes, but because we showed up.”\nThe graduation ceremonies at Royal High School began with a senior parade. Students, friends and family gathered in the high school parking lot and, accompanied by fire and police sirens, took one last loop through town in vehicles festooned with banners, flags and streamers. Then the students assembled on the football field as their families watched from the stands.\nMany of the 112 students who graduated Friday were the first in their families to finish school, and more are the first to pursue post-secondary education. Principal Courtney McCoy began the commencement ceremony by asking those students to stand and be recognized.\nBesides Guerrero, class Treasurer Jade Flores Ayala addressed her peers.\n“We won't always know what's coming next,” she said. “But if high school has taught us anything, it’s that we can overcome any challenges and accomplish great things. So, let's carry this spirit with us. Follow your dreams, keep learning, because the world needs our voice, our creativity and our courage.”\nStudent speaker David De La Rosa Jr. thanked the teachers and parents who had guided the class along.\n“You cheered us on, kept us going and believed in us when we didn’t always believe in ourselves,” he said. “Your love, patience and support gave us the foundation we needed to grow.”\nThe guest speaker, chosen by the students, was English and Language Arts teacher Ausencio Delgado.\n“Look at this crowd of caps and gowns, grinning like you just pulled off the ultimate senior prank,” Delgado said. “Four years ago, you walked in nervous, maybe a little scared, but definitely excited. Now here you are, terrified, anxious and ready for a new adventure … Courage isn’t the absence of fear. It’s wrestling fear to the ground. It’s launching yourself into the air, trusting you’ll land on your feet. It’s showing up even when you might stumble.\nGo forth and make your mark, Royal Knights,” Delgado concluded. “We believe in you. I believe in you.”",
