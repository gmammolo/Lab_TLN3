  "text": "New University of Alaska Anchorage women’s basketball head coach Matt Thune has massive shoes to fill.\nHe is the successor to the legendary Ryan McCarthy, who established the Seawolves as one of the top NCAA Division II teams during his 13 years at the helm. McCarthy departed last month to become the head coach at the Division I level with Fresno State.\n“I have a lot of respect for Ryan and what he’s done here,” Thune said. “It’s hard to sustain winning anywhere. Him and I spent a few hours the other day talking (about) everything UAA and he was giving me some help.”\nThune is coming to coach at the Division II level after spending last year as an assistant at Division I Seattle University. With McCarthy moving up to Division I, the two gave each other tips on coaching and recruiting.\n[‘Change is inevitable’: Departing UAA women’s basketball coach and players reflect on his history and impact]\nWhether Thune was taking over for one of the best programs in the nation or tasked with turning around one that had been downtrodden, pressure was inevitable. But he wouldn’t let it get to him either way.\n“No matter what situation you’re in, there’s pressure to win,” he said. “It’s more just excitement about the school (and) the facilities we have here. It’s a great opportunity, and when players come here to see it, the kids I’m recruiting right now are super hype.”\nFour former Seawolves who were key to last year’s success are following McCarthy to Fresno State to become Bulldogs. The list includes standout guard Emilia Long, who led the team in assists and steals and was the second-leading scorer, as well as forward Ashlyn Rean, who finished second in rebounds and fourth in scoring.\nFormer Colony High School standout Indiya Clarke, who was initially going to transfer to UAA, will also be joining McCarthy in Fresno.\nThe only holdover who played a wealth of meaningful minutes for the team last year is guard Elaina Mack of King Cove, so in some ways, Thune feels like they’re starting fresh.\n“We still have incoming freshmen from Alaska. We’re going to mix a group of transfers and stuff like that,” he said. “His style of basketball, there’s not really going to be that learning curve or all those types of dynamics because nobody on the team was really here for it. … You can come in and put your system in and recruit to the way you like to play and get after it.”\nDispelling misconceptions\nThune believes his wealth of experience from coaching over a decade at the Division I level is transferable.\n“There’s good basketball everywhere, so I don’t like to get into the comparison game both ways because I think at Division I level, there tends to be a general disrespect on what goes on at Division II, which I don’t agree with,” he said.\nThune, who has made multiple coaching stops in the past five years, made a habit of following basketball at all levels and has close friends who coach at Division II and III schools.\n“If you see good basketball, you know where it’s at,” he said. “There are kids that I’ve coached at previous institutions that are in this league so I’ve been watching them the last few years and it’s going to be fun and a challenge. If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be too enjoyable. You want something that’s hard. If it’s easy, it gets boring.”\nUpholding tradition and strong community presence\nMcCarthy, who grew up in Alaska, was a pillar in the Anchorage basketball community on and off the court. A big staple of every program Thune has been a part of was being involved with the community, and he plans to continue doing that in his new position.\n“It’s important to get out into the community with open arms and meet everybody that wants to show you support,” he said. “The women’s basketball team having the support of the community is a huge thing because for our kids to be able to see fans in the stands for all the work they put in is awesome.”\nThune is excited to meet new people and learn all he can about the state, Anchorage and the university that he’ll be calling home for the foreseeable future.\n“I’ve been doing that in the short time that I’ve been here so far for about a week,” he said. “Every day I’m meeting new people and getting phone calls.”\nThe next step is assembling a staff that can help make the vision he has for the program come to fruition.\n“I think we should hit the ground running,” Thune said.\nA big part of his responsibility as the next Seawolves head coach is helping facilitate the Great Alaska Shootout by getting quality teams interested in making the trek north for the tournament.\n“When I was on my way up here, I was on the phone with 50 to 100 coaches, so there’s interest,” Thune said. “As long as we can facilitate the tournament, there’s going to be people that want to come up here.”\nHe began his coaching career as an assistant at the University of Louisville under head coach Jeff Walz, who wants to bring the Cardinals to the Shootout in the next year or two.\n“I got to dive in and really learn what that experience is about and what that tournament looks like,” Thune said. “I kind of know it from afar.”\nThere are also former Alaska prep stars currently playing at Division I and II colleges who fans of the program and families of those players would like to see come up for a game, even if it isn’t for the Shootout.\nOne of the most notable of the bunch is University of Washington guard Sayvia Sellers, who starred at Anchorage Christian School and is coming off a breakout sophomore campaign for the Huskies. There’s a strong chance that she could grace the hardwood at the Alaska Airlines Center for the first time since leading the Lions to a fourth straight state title as a senior in 2023.\n“Her coaches are open to it right now, so we just got to get them to sign on a line,” Thune said.\nIdeal family dynamics\nThune is bringing his wife, Kaitlin, and two children — son Vance and daughter Chandler — along with him to embark on this next chapter of his career and their lives.\n“We’re accustomed to moving around the country,” Thune said. “I’ve done it multiple times. I’ve moved from the Midwest out West, from out West to Boston, and we made our way back West (to Seattle). We’re kind of troopers.”\nThune said his wife has been “all on board” with every move their young family has had to make as a result of his career. Given her background working in college athletics, she understands what the lifestyle entails, he says.\nShe also enjoys the outdoors and is ecstatic about the opportunity to live in Alaska.\n“We met while we were in Utah and this part of the country has just kind of captivated us,” Thune said.\nTheir children will also be staples at practices and other sporting events on campus, not just basketball.\n“They can’t wait to get up here,” Thune said. “We were able to get a house situated, so it’s really just about getting up here and getting comfortable, getting acquainted with people in the community, and my wife likes to be around the team as well.”\nThe Thunes are already beginning to plan family excursions around the state, including popular tourist attractions such as museums in Anchorage and the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward.\n“We have a laundry list going, and we’ll probably try to attack it until the season starts,” he said.",
