  "text": "Glacier High grads receive Montana Seal of Biliteracy for third year\nEighteen Glacier High School graduates received the Montana Seals of Biliteracy on their diplomas.\nThis is the third year Glacier has recognized students through the state seal program, which was adopted by the Montana Board of Education in 2021 to recognize students who demonstrate proficiency in two or more languages during their high school years.\nThis year’s recipients received seals in Spanish, French and Vietnamese. One grad, Daniel Onyshchuk, received two seals, the gold seal in Ukrainian and a platinum seal in Russian. The platinum seal is awarded to those students who have achieved the highest possible level of proficiency that the state recognizes.\nSpanish seal recipients are Carl Bitney, Kennady Garvin, Isaac Haynes, Wyatt Jensen, Charlotte Osler, Grace Pickering, Cielo Sallee, Emmery Schmidt, Shae Warner and Aidan Zlogar.\nFrench seal recipients are Coralynn Buehner, Andrew Crane, Elias Holly, Maya Kinkaid, Gabriel Luehr and Max Waverek.\nThe Vietnamese seal recipient was Kim Huynh.\nIn addition to the diploma seals, the accomplishment will be reflected in their high school transcripts. Students were also honored in April at the International Languages Recognition ceremony with a pin bearing the official seal from the Montana Board of Public Education.\nDuring the 2024-25 school year, 92 sophomores, juniors and seniors tested in pursuit of the seal. While students may test in the three languages offered at Glacier High School, students may also test in a language that they feel they can demonstrate proficiency in, such as a language spoken at home.\nTo qualify for a gold or platinum seal, students must reach a certain proficiency level in writing, speaking, reading and listening in addition to meeting state graduation requirements.\n\"Mastering more than one language is vital for our students’ success in today’s interconnected world. These awards recognize not only their proficiency in two or more languages but also their understanding of a broader world and their place within it,\" said Stephanie Hill, French teacher and international languages activities coordinator.",
