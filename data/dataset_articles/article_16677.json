  "text": "'One of the biggest milestones in life' reached for Warden grads\nWARDEN – Warden High School held its graduation ceremony last Friday to celebrate its students as they move on from high school and into their futures.\n“To the class of 2025, we did it. But more importantly, you did,” said Miliany Pruneda, Warden High School’s valedictorian. “You have accomplished one of the biggest milestones in life, high school graduation.”\nPruneda thanked her family for all the support and motivation that they have given her throughout her journey. She said her greatest motivation in earning the title of valedictorian came from her brother, whom she saw pushing himself every day.\n“I did what I could to be my best and this was my best,” said Pruneda.\nHer parents, Omar and Belinda Pruneda, are both extremely proud of her efforts in graduating and achieving valedictorian.\nMiliany said she plans on attending Washington State University to study Elementary School Education this fall. There, she hopes to get an English Language Learning endorsement and obtain her master's degree.\nGraciela Castillo said she wanted to give thanks to the faculty at the school for the time and energy they put into creating an environment that allowed the class to thrive in achieving better futures for themselves.\nOne of the greatest memories she has taken from her time in high school is her part in working on the mural they created at the elementary school in Warden.\n“Having all the kids and teachers come walking by the hallway and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I want to do that,’” she said. “It really makes me happy seeing that I’ve hopefully inspired many other people to do the same thing.”\nCastillo said her love of art comes from her fascination with ancient Roman architecture while she took an independent study class in TRIO. She plans on attending the University of Idaho to get her master’s in architecture along with a minor in interior design, and afterward, she hopes to make a trip to Rome to visit the Pantheon, which has become her inspiration.\nFor some, the graduation brought both happy and sad feelings, such as for Yaretzi Catalan Ayala.\n“I feel really happy, but really emotional because I’m going to miss high school and my old teachers,” she said.\nOne of the moments she recalls being very proud of from her time in high school was her efforts in cross country as she pushed through her own struggles and still accomplished her goals.\n“It was a hard time doing cross country and I feel really accomplished that I did it,” she said.\nAnthony Gutierrez said that at the time, the feeling of finally being out of school hadn’t fully hit him yet.\n“It just feels amazing,\" he said. “I knew I was going to make it and just the hard work in the classroom, outside the classroom, everything, it all paid off to this day,”\nAt the end of her speech, Pruneda said the quote that their class chose came from Tim McGraw, where he said, “Chase your dreams, but always know the road that’ll lead you home again.” Pruneda said that the most important thing the class can do as they move forward is to remember where they came from and cherish the lifelong connections and friendships made along the way.\n“Now we are sitting here at the end of our high school journey, and I know many of us are starting to feel so many emotions about starting our new lives and that’s OK because it’s part of the process,” said Pruneda. “The best advice I could give to you is to close your eyes, breathe and believe in yourself because I know you can do it.”",
