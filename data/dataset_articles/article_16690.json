  "text": "MAHWAH — A plan for school facility maintenance and improvements will \"likely\" include a bond referendum in 2026, School Superintendent Michael DeTuro said on June 10. \"This community has not been asked to approve a referendum in more than 20 years,\" DeTuro told the Board of Education. \"The state restricts public school budgets to a 2% increase in property tax revenue. Meanwhile, costs go up without that kind of restriction.\" How much and what projects would be included have yet to be defined. However, DeTuro made repeated references to \"partial\" upgrades of building roofing, windows and heating/cooling systems in the past. \"Bond funding could shift certain building maintenance costs outside the constraints of the 2% budget cap,\" DeTuro said. \"Importantly, it would also come with state financial aid to reduce the amount paid by local taxes. We would pay 100% of HVAC/roofing costs if the work were paid for through our operating budget. If the same work were funded through bonds and state aid, we would pay about 70% of the costs.\" DeTuro listed \"significant accomplishments\" by the district over the past seven to 10 years with \"careful financial planning,\" including the Thunderbird Think Tank at Mahwah High School, the Innovation Lab at Joyce Kilmer School, expanding kindergarten to a full-day program, and starting a 1:1 technology initiative for grades three through 12. The district's building needs are being assessed by architectural and engineering firms, DeTuro said. Community input will be encouraged \"this upcoming fall with a meeting focused specifically on the state of our facilities,\" he said, aiming for a vote \"as early as March 2026.\" Residents approved a $12.8 million expansion project for the high school and middle school in March 2003. High school projects included nine new classrooms, two science labs, a computer lab, a teachers' workroom and an expansion of the guidance offices. Ramapo Ridge Middle School received eight new classrooms, two science labs and a 4,000-square-foot addition to the gym. Heating and ventilation upgrades and new furniture costs were included. The district received $3.3 million in state aid toward the project's cost, leaving taxpayers with a $9.5 million bill for the 20-year bond. At the time, the owner of a home assessed at $300,000 was expected to pay an additional $66 in yearly school property taxes to fund the project. The district educates 2,729students in six schools from preschool through 12th grade.
