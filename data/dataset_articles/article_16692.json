  "text": "111th graduating class strolls out in style in Ephrata\nEPHRATA — About 200 students strolled, cavorted, lightsaber-battled and marched their way onto the Ephrata High School football field last Friday evening. Some wore honor cords showing accomplishments, some had decorated mortar boards and others a look of relief that their day had finally come.\nStudent speaker, Charles Flynn, a graduating senior and outgoing Associated Student Body president, thanked the teachers, staff, parents and others who’d helped him and his classmates reach their educational and other goals.\n“I would also like to thank the class behind me,” Flynn said while at the podium, facing the gathered audience. “Many of us have grown up with each other since grade school, making mistakes and maturing from them along the way, staying up late to complete work, then waking up early to turn it in, going to football games and bonfires. All of these moments have given me the utmost confidence in the class sitting behind me. Today is not merely a heartfelt goodbye, but it is also a new beginning.”\nFlynn said he and many of his classmates are now facing the future in a new way for the first time. They’ll be able to take on the challenges they choose and pursue those choices. He encouraged his classmates to be brave as they move forward into the future, quoting a writer, director, philosopher and poet he admires.\n“As Suzy Kassem once said, ‘Fear kills more dreams than failure ever will.’ This quote can apply in two ways, fear of others and fear of yourself. The first is self-explanatory: fear of others’ judgment. Don’t let people’s opinions dictate what you do. After all, it’s your life, not theirs. The second one is a bit more complex. What do I mean by fear of yourself? I mean fear of being bad, fear of being vulnerable to yourself when trying something new. It’s okay to suck. Pushing through failure and overcoming it is the key to growing as a person in this time of finding ourselves and our passions. I believe that is integral to keep this moment in mind.”\nThe class also chose Erika Morford to speak for them. In introducing Morford, classmate Brydon Stacy said Morford was someone who shows up with a commitment to both the school and the community as a whole.\n“I’m honored to stand here tonight on behalf of the Class of 2025,” Morford began. It feels surreal to be in this moment, and I am delighted to share it with each and every one of you.”\nMorford reflected on the dreams the class had worked on achieving together, especially graduation, and she said she was proud of the class and grateful to the families and other supporters the class had during their time at EHS.\nMorford noted that her class is unique.\n“We are the final class to carry the memory of COVID-19 through our years of high school. We began this journey masked up, spread out and walking into classrooms that didn’t look or feel like what we expected,” she said. “The world felt uncertain. The rules kept changing, and we weren’t sure what high school was supposed to be like.”\nThat gave the students a unique strength, though, Morford said. They were adaptable and resilient and able to face things that require a little something extra.\n“We became students who weren’t afraid to do hard things. We became leaders who understood that flexibility and grit often matter more than having all the answers,” she said.\nStudent speaker Llandon Ahmann subsequently wished a fellow graduate, Payton Riggs, a happy birthday and reflected on how he appreciated his community and classmates.\nClosing out the speakers was Marla Alsopp, an English instructor, among other titles. Alsopp gave the students one last homework assignment, a series of several books focused on compassion, kindness and determination.\nEHS Principal Ashlie Miller closed out the ceremony by announcing each of the grads by name, instructing them to turn their tassels and watching each pass by. This was Miller’s first graduation as principal at EHS.",
