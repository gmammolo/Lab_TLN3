  "text": "Moses Lake Christian Academy sends graduates forth with prayers, blessings\nMOSES LAKE — The Moses Lake Christian Academy marked a significant milestone May 31 as the Class of 2025 celebrated its graduation ceremony, featuring seven accomplished students.\nThe event, held at the academy’s auditorium, was attended by parents, faculty and friends, all coming together to celebrate the hard work and dedication of these young graduates.\nThe ceremony opened with a heartfelt message from Valedictorian Brandon Swinger, who reflected on the trials and tribulations that shaped their high school experience.\n“Life is hard, so every day I pray that God makes me harder,” he quoted the class motto, emphasizing resilience and the importance of faith amidst challenges.\nHe further encouraged his peers to embrace their potential.\n“You can either be the civilian or you can be the hero who sacrifices everything to credit those around him,” he said.\nSwinger shared anecdotes about popular heroes like Peter Parker, drawing parallels between their struggles and the challenges faced by students in their academic journeys.\n“Be like Peter, do the things you’re afraid to do,” he urged, inspiring his classmates to pursue their aspirations boldly.\nFollowing Swinger’s address, Tyler Tadema, the senior class advisor, offered blessings and reflections on each graduate’s character.\n“Jennika, you are a woman of grace. I bless you. God is able to make all grace abound to you,” he said, acknowledging the unique contributions of each student to the academy community.\nHis sentiments were echoed throughout the event, with every graduate receiving personal words of encouragement.\nIn his speech, Kayden Edwards highlighted the importance of continuous growth beyond graduation.\n“The road ahead is uncertain. We might feel overwhelmed, but we can lean on that promise for most of our lives,” he said, referencing Matthew 28:20, which reassures believers of Christ’s constant presence.\nThe keynote address featured Mark Bassett, who underscored the values integral to the academy’s mission.\n“Your journey is just beginning, and the questions you face are significant. Seek to be a shepherd, a servant, and to understand suffering in your path,” he said.\nThe ceremony concluded with the formal awarding of diplomas, marking not just an end but the beginning of a new chapter for the Class of 2025.\n“Congratulations, Class of 2025,” the administration announced as the graduates turned their tassels from right to left.",
