  "text": "Want to work abroad? 5 countries offering post-study visas in 2025\nFrom Germany's tuition-free universities to Japan's tech-driven innovation hubs, students now have a world of post-study work options to explore. Here's the full list.\nIn Short\n- Germany offers 18-month post-study work visa for job-seeking graduates\n- France allows master's grads to stay up to 2 years after studies\n- Japan grants 1-year visa to seek jobs, extendable upon employment\nForget USA, Canada, or even the UK -- while these have long been popular choices for study abroad, students today are looking beyond them. Several other countries, home to some of the world’s top universities, now offer excellent opportunities, including post-study work visas and options to bring dependants.\nWith stricter visa rules in the USA following Trump-era policies, and both Canada and the UK reducing visa benefits, many students are asking: what are the best alternatives? Here’s a list of countries that offer strong academic programmes along with favourable visa and work options.\n1. GERMANY\nWhy choose Germany?\nGermany is one of the best places in the world to study, especially for engineering, technology, and business. Public universities charge little to no tuition fees.\nStudent visa:\nStudents need a National Visa (D visa). You must show admission to a German university, proof of funds (about 11,208 per year), and health insurance.\nPost-Study work visa:\nGraduates can apply for an 18-month job-seeking visa after completing their studies. Once employed in a field related to their degree, they can apply for a EU Blue Card or residence permit.\n2. FRANCE\nWhy choose France?\nFrance offers strong academic programs, especially in fashion, business, and arts. Many courses are now taught in English.\nStudent visa:\nYou need a long-stay visa (VLS-TS). Proof of university admission, funds (~7,380 per year), and accommodation are required.\nPost-Study work visa:\nMaster’s graduates can apply for a temporary residence permit valid for 12–24 months to find work or start a business.\n3. AUSTRALIA\nWhy choose Australia?\nWith globally ranked universities and a diverse environment, Australia is a top choice for science, engineering, and healthcare students.\nStudent visa (Subclass 500):\nRequires confirmation of enrolment (CoE), proof of funds, English proficiency, and health cover.\nPost-Study work visa (Subclass 485):\nGraduates can stay for 2 to 4 years depending on their qualification and the city of study. Regional areas offer extended work rights.\nDependents:\nStudents can bring their spouse and children on dependent visas. In some cases, dependants can also work.\n4. JAPAN\nWhy choose Japan?\nJapan is known for its high-quality education, especially in technology and innovation, along with generous scholarships for international students.\nStudent visa:\nYou’ll need a Certificate of Eligibility from the university, proof of funds, and a valid passport.\nPost-Study work visa:\nGraduates can switch to a Designated Activities visa for up to 1 year to find work. Once employed, they can move to a work visa.\n5. IRELAND\nWhy choose Ireland?\nIreland is an English-speaking country with top universities in IT, pharmaceuticals, and business. It's also a growing tech hub.\nStudent visa (Stamp 2):\nRequires proof of admission, financial support (7,000 minimum), and private health insurance.\nPost-Study work visa:\nGraduates of eligible courses can stay for up to 2 years under the Third Level Graduate Scheme to look for a job.\nDependents:\nPhD students and some master’s students may bring dependants, subject to approval.\nFrom the innovation hubs of Japan to the research-driven classrooms of Germany, new doors are opening -- welcoming students to learn.\nThe map of opportunity has changed. The question is -- are you ready to explore beyond the usual and find your place in a country that values your dreams?",
