  "text": "A new agreement between the University of Otago and Otago Girls’ High School aims to create a seamless pathway between secondary and tertiary education for international students wanting to study in Dunedin.\nIn a region-first, the Memorandum of Understanding – signed today by Vice-Chancellor Grant Robertson and Otago Girls’ High School Principal Bridget Davidson – encourages closer collaboration between the institutions with a particular focus on providing teaching and learning opportunities for the school’s international students.\nUnder the agreement, the School’s Department of International Students will work closely with the University’s Pathway department to seamlessly transition their international students wanting to go onto tertiary study at Otago. Pathway | Te Huarahi offers university preparation programmes to assist all students (international and domestic) achieve university entrance in New Zealand.\nBridget says the agreement helps provide prospective international students and their parents an opportunity to chart a long-term educational pathway before joining the school.\n“The parents of international students need this certainty when making decisions about where their child may go to live and study,” she says.\n“The MOU is a win-win in that it provides this certainty, while also making both Otago Girls’ High School and the University of Otago a more attractive option in a competitive market.”\nGrant says the MOU signing carries on the tradition of Otago being a place of many firsts.\n“The University of Otago was New Zealand’s first university, while Otago Girls’ High School was the first state-run girls’ high school established in the southern hemisphere. Today our institutions are signing the first agreement of its kind in this region.\n“It’s fantastic to work together in this way and highlight the region’s longstanding and outstanding reputation for educational excellence, at all levels, to an international market.\n“Otago Girls’ High School international students going on to study at the University of Otago will also be eligible to apply for the generous and highly competitive suite of international scholarships we have on offer,” Grant says.\nOtago Girls’ High School currently hosts about 50 international students each year.\nThe University of Otago currently welcomes about 2,500 international students each year. Under Pae Tata, its strategic plan to 2030, the University plans to significantly increase those numbers over the coming years.\n“Growing our international connections and student cohort adds depth and richness to our student experience, while also enhancing our global standing and reputation, and contributing to our financial sustainability,” Grant says.",
