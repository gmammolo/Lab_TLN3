  "text": "IU Police Academy signs on to Deaf culture training\nThursday, June 12, 2025\nIndiana University now trains police academy recruits in Deaf culture awareness and basic American Sign Language.\nThe program aims to improve communication between future officers and the Deaf community across campuses statewide.\nBrennan Cox, a law student and part-time officer for the Indiana University Police Department, helped launch the course after noticing a gap in police training on interacting with Deaf individuals.\n\"This training is beneficial for the Deaf community because it creates safer interactions with officers and members of the Deaf community, creates more engagement with the Deaf community,\" Cox explained. \"Really, we just want the Deaf community to know that we want to learn and that officers have a desire to learn about the Deaf community.\"\nThe nearly three-hour course features Deaf faculty who teach recruits key signs like \"police,\" \"help,\" and \"stop,\" while emphasizing patience and alternative communication methods.\nCox noted the training also benefits officers themselves.\n\"What made me want to bring this training to IU Police Academy is I took ASL when I was in my undergraduate at IU for two years,\" Cox recounted. \"It made me really just become passionate about how law enforcement interacts with members of the Deaf community and how we can better serve them.\"\nThe program now includes recruits from Indiana University campuses in Bloomington, Indianapolis, and South Bend and plans to expand to other agencies.\nget more stories like this via email\nEnvironment\nAs the cleanup effort continues at Hobbs State Park Conservation Area in Rogers, officials with Arkansas State Parks have authorized a temporary …\nSocial Issues\nJune is Pride Month, and Washington's Lavender Rights Project is celebrating with a Black Trans Comedy Showcase.
