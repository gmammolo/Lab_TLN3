  "text": "On 5 June 2025, the University of Cologne and the non-profit Alfred Landecker Foundation, founded by the Reimann family, signed a cooperation agreement to establish the Adenauer School of Government (ASG). The aim of the ASG is to establish itself as a leading, non-partisan center for public policy, governance and administrative sciences that helps to shape relevant developments in economics and other research fields. The school will be funded for an unlimited term, with an initial budget of ten million euros per year.\nProfessor Dr Joybrato Mukherjee, Rector of the University of Cologne, emphasizes that the university, with its top international research, its outstanding teaching facilities and its proximity to Brussels and Paris in the heart of Europe, is ideal for the extraordinary initiative of the Alfred Landecker Foundation. According to Rector Mukherjee, the decision to name the new School of Government after Konrad Adenauer is based not only on his role as the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and as one of the architects of Europe, but also on his time as Mayor of Cologne and his key role in re-establishing the University of Cologne. Rector Mukherjee explains: “By founding the Adenauer School, the University of Cologne is strengthening its research and teaching profile. The generous grant enables us to attract leading international scholars to Cologne to develop solutions for pressing social challenges and to design future-oriented teaching concepts. I would like to thank the Alfred Landecker Foundation and its Chair Dr Peter Harf for their extraordinary trust in our university.”\nDr Peter Harf, Chair of the Alfred Landecker Foundation and its Governing Council, says: “In the face of significant social as well as foreign and security policy challenges, and a profound shift in Germany’s role within Europe, it is of crucial importance that our country is governed responsibly and in a scientifically sound manner if it is to remain viable in the future. Following the model of government schools in English-speaking countries, the Adenauer School will make a significant contribution in research and teaching and educate future decision-makers in an academically excellent, interdisciplinary and practice-oriented environment. This new school will be more than a place of learning – it will act as a driving force for bringing about change and making an impact. This will strengthen liberal democratic values and a lively culture of debate in our society.”\nIna Brandes, Minister of Science of North Rhine-Westphalia, says: “With his prudent and courageous governing decisions, Konrad Adenauer shaped the city of Cologne and Germany like no one else. Particularly in times of upheaval like the ones we are currently experiencing, we need research and teaching in public policy, governance and administrative sciences that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. I would like to thank the Alfred Landecker Foundation, which has recognized the particular challenges of our time and is committed to providing excellent training for decision-makers in the public sector. The Adenauer School of Government meets all the criteria to become a new flagship for the science hub North Rhine-Westphalia.”\nProfessor Dr Axel Ockenfels was appointed head of the Adenauer School of Government. He is Professor of Economics at the University of Cologne and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn. In addition to establishing the School as a central academic institution and preparing a study and research programme, the university will also initiate the first appointment procedures in the coming months.\nPress and Communications Team:\nDr Elisabeth Hoffmanne.hoffmannverw.uni-koeln.de",
