  "text": "June 12, 2025\nST. PETERSBURG, FL, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Erica Perry Briody, MBA, has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nMs. Briody has established herself as a distinguished expert in talent acquisition, renowned for her ability to identify, attract and hire top talent that aligns with organizational culture. In addition to her corporate accomplishments, she is a passionate advocate for empowering the next generation of women in the workplace. She actively mentors young women around the world and is the author of \"Good Girl, Be Bad,\" a bold and inspiring guide designed to help women build confidence, speak up and lead with purpose. Currently, Ms. Briody serves as the executive talent acquisition advisor at Culture Index, a role she has held since 2023. In this capacity, she partners with executives and start-ups to interpret data that informs hiring decisions, correlating human traits with revenue, profit and growth. She also co-developed C-Hire, a workshop designed for leaders to elevate their approach to targeting culturally aligned talent.\nIn addition to her executive role, Ms. Briody is the owner of Culturally Aligned Talent, where she continues to leverage her skills in talent acquisition as she works with clients to develop their employee value propositions, branding strategies and hiring expertise. Previously, she was the senior vice president of global talent acquisition at REEF in Miami from 2021 to 2023. Ms. Briody's tenure at REEF was preceded by a brief but impactful period as a C-suite and talent acquisition consultant at BYJU'S in 2021.\nFrom 2019 to 2021, Ms. Briody served as the senior vice president of global talent acquisition at OYO, where she led executive hiring and built a scalable talent infrastructure to support the company's rapid global expansion. Her earlier experience includes a pivotal role as senior vice president and global talent acquisition leader at Quintiles, which later became IQVIA, from 2016 to 2019. During this time, she oversaw global recruitment operations, delivering 17,000 hires annually, and led the M&A talent strategy and workforce planning.\nOne of Ms. Briody's most notable achievements occurred during her tenure as the global head of talent and search at Novartis from 2013 to 2015. She successfully established a data-driven talent mapping and acquisition center with operations extending to India, achieving an ambitious goal of hiring 25,000 people annually while maintaining an impressive Net Promoter Score. Her leadership was widely praised for its effectiveness and the rapid results it achieved. Before joining Novartis, Ms. Briody served as the head of talent acquisition for EMEA at General Electric in London from 2011 to 2013. Additionally, Ms. Briody has owned several companies, including a Miami-based executive recruitment firm, where she worked with clients to attract, profile, and hire executives for U.S. companies expanding internationally.\nMs. Briody's career spans five continents, having lived and worked across Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America. When based in Hong Kong, she led executive recruitment efforts throughout China. She was the first to establish a recruitment process outsourcing service in China, which was highly recognized in the South China Morning Post. In Bahrain, she supported leadership development across the Gulf region, and in India, she championed inclusive hiring strategies while mentoring rising female leaders. Fluent in Spanish, French and Mandarin, Ms. Briody brings a unique cultural agility to every engagement. Her commitment to empowering women extends beyond the boardroom: she has delivered workshops on executive presence to students in girls' schools across the UK and continues to mentor young women worldwide.\nMs. Briody's academic background includes a Master of Business Administration in international business from Henley Business School, where she graduated with academic distinction in 2011. She also holds a bachelor's degree in business and communications with a minor in French from the University of South Florida in Tampa. Ms. Briody's education has been complemented by numerous certifications, including the Lominger Leadership Architect Certification from Korn Ferry, the Strategic Workforce Planning Diploma from the Human Capital Institute and the Six Sigma Green Belt Certification from GE, among others.\nBeyond her professional accomplishments, Ms. Briody is deeply committed to civic and humanitarian causes. She has been actively involved with organizations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, programs supporting survivors of domestic violence and initiatives addressing food insecurity in local homeless shelters. She also owns transitional housing properties, where she provides safe, supportive spaces for individuals recovering from homelessness, abusive relationships or substance use challenges–helping them rebuild their lives with dignity and stability.\nIn recognition of her contributions to human resources and leadership, Ms. Briody has received several awards, including the Luminary Award from WIN in 2017 and the HRO Superstar Award from HRO Global in both 2014 and 2017. She was also honored with the Top Women HR Leadership Technology Application award in 2020.\nReflecting on her career, Ms. Briody credits her success to a strong commitment to advancing women in the workplace. After observing that many capable women were passed over for promotions simply because they did not advocate for themselves and recognizing significant pay disparities among individuals with similar experience levels, Ms. Briody felt a clear responsibility to act and address these inequities.\nOutside her professional life, Ms. Briody enjoys spending time with her daughters, Ashley and Emma, who inspire her every day, as well as her three Shih Tzu puppies. She envisions launching a \"Be BAD\" (Bold, Ambitious, and Determined) Club to empower young women further to find their voice and inspire change. As part of this effort, she continues to speak at conferences, schools and universities and plans to return to India to promote her book and mentor young women. Through these initiatives and her plan to develop executive workshops, Ms. Briody hopes to leave a legacy of leadership, inclusion and advocacy.\nAbout Marquis Who's Who®:\nSince 1899, when A. N.
