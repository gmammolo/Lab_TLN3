  "text": "A solar-powered water pumping machine to pump about 800 litres of water for the Amrahia Community School in the La Nkwantanang Madina Municipality of the Greater Accra Region was inaugurated on Tuesday.\nThis followed the breakdown of the water system of the school which has a student population of over 300.\nThe facility, funded by the 2024 Cohorts of the Global Executive Master Business Administration (GEMBE) School, was constructed in four months by Advance Solar Solutions Company to help address the acute water problem facing the School.\nFitted with Chlorine reservoirs, the facility comes with an Osmosis treatment plant, an Anesta pumping marching of 900 watts and overhead tanks that can serve the entire school.\nThe President of the 2024 Cohorts, Zak Boughalem, who are products of the China Europe International Business School (CHIBS), in handing over the facility said it was the desire of the group to leave a lasting legacy for the community.\nHe said the gesture was in reciprocal of what the CHIBS had given them, stating that, “We are grateful for the hospitality from Ghanaians and ever ready to provide more when duty calls,” adding “the African brotherly love must be extended to every country.”\nProfessor Gordon Adomdza, Director CEIBS Africa, said access to clean water formed part of Sustainable development goals and commended the Cohorts for the initiative and charged the School to take good care of it.\nThe Director of the School, Mustapha Forson, commended the Cohorts for the gesture, and urged other philanthropists to emulate their example\n FROM LAWRENCE VOMAFA-AKPALU, AMRAHIA",
