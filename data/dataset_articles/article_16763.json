Dr. Richard Kreider, professor and director of the Exercise & Sport Nutrition Lab at Texas A&M University, has spent over 30 years researching the compound.\nCreatine, a naturally occurring compound found in muscle, combines with phosphate to form creatine phosphate, a key player in cellular energy production. While the body produces about a gram of creatine daily, experts recommend an intake of 2 to 4 grams per day based on activity level and muscle mass. Because dietary creatine primarily comes from meat and fish, supplementation is especially beneficial for vegetarians and vegans.\nKreider also emphasized its importance across the lifespan. “Creatine is important for everyone as they age,” he said. It may help mitigate age-related declines in muscle mass and cognitive function. In adolescents, low dietary creatine has been linked to slower growth and higher body fat.\nContrary to lingering myths, creatine’s safety is well-supported. “There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” said Kreider. He added that supposed side effects like bloating or cramping have not been substantiated and, in fact, creatine may help reduce cramping by improving hydration.\nAs Kreider and his colleagues continue to advocate for creatine’s safe use, they urge that its benefits be made accessible to all—not just athletes.\nReference: Richard B.
