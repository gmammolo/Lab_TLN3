  "text": "On June 10, as part of the official visit to France by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, Minister of Science and Technology Nguyen Manh Hung held a working session with Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris).\nMinister Nguyen Manh Hung meets with Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Photo: PV\nDuring the meeting, the IP Paris leadership presented an overview of the institute’s history, operational model, and academic mission.\nFounded in 2019 by decree of the French Prime Minister, IP Paris consolidates six of France’s premier technical institutions: École Polytechnique, ENSTA Paris, Télécom Paris, Télécom SudParis, ENSAE Paris, and the Graduate School of Engineering and Innovation.\nThe creation of IP Paris reflects the French government’s ambition to elevate its global university rankings, particularly in international education performance assessments.\nIP Paris currently houses numerous large-scale interdisciplinary research centers and laboratories. Among its standout models is Hi! Paris - France’s leading center for artificial intelligence and data science.\nAt the session, Minister Hung shared Vietnam’s need for strategic technology development and expressed that IP Paris, with its world-class research infrastructure, is an ideal strategic partner - especially in AI, a sector identified as critical to Vietnam’s long-term growth.\nThe minister also proposed that IP Paris collaborate with Vietnam’s leading ICT universities to co-develop joint graduate programs in science, technology, and ICT.\nThis proposal aligns with insights from Professor Nguyen Van Tam, Acting Head of the Department of Computer Science, Data, and AI at IP Paris, who noted that deep tech sectors now especially require high-level researchers, particularly at the PhD level.\nBoth sides agreed to continue communication via the Science and Technology Representative Office to exchange information and explore concrete cooperation opportunities.\nOn the same day, Minister Hung also joined Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in a meeting with Vietnamese intellectuals and experts residing in France. At the event, attendees shared recommendations on technology selection, standards development, and talent ecosystem building across key sectors including nuclear energy, semiconductors, railways, and artificial intelligence - contributing to deeper Vietnam-France cooperation.\nIn response, Minister Hung offered insights and suggestions on practical working models that could enable experts and scientists to make more impactful contributions to Vietnam’s science and technology development.\nThai Khang",
