  "text": "USC Football Recruiting: Trojans building an elite 2026 class\nAfter consecutive cycles ranked No. 15 or lower in the On3 Industry Football Team Recruiting Rankings, USC is looking to bounce back with what could become the best class of the Lincoln Riley era.\nAt the beginning of June, the Trojans hold the country’s No. 1 class and a whopping 28 commitments — nearly double what every other Power 4 program in the country has in their own classes. One checks in as a five-star, while 17 more check in as four-stars and another 10 check in as three-stars. And a number of those are on the cusp of attaining blue-chip status.\nUSC has seen a few departures from the group, notable five-star linebacker Xavier Griffin, who opted to decommit last month. He was one of two early five-star commits, along Rancho Cucamonga (Calif.) CB RJ Sermons, who joined the class on Dec. 13. He opted to graduate early and reclassify up a year to USC’s 2025 class on May 23.\nIt didn’t take Riley and Co. long to find another elite prospect though, as five-star tight end Mark Bowman pledged to the Trojans exactly a week later. He joins a group headlined by top-100 quarterback Jonas Williams, who USC flipped away from rival Oregon. They also poached four-star defensive lineman Tomuhini Topui from the Ducks, as well as beating them out for elite offensive tackle Keenyi Pepe.\nIn total, more than half of the Trojans’ class hails from the Golden State (63%), and 63% of current commits are blue-chip prospects in the On3 Industry Ranking. Alongside Bowman, Pepe, and Williams, USC has top-100 commitments from CB Elbert Hill (No. 39), EDGE Simote Katoanga (No. 65), CB Brandon Lockhart (No. 71), and DL Jaimeon Winfield (No. 95).\nTrojans commitments by position\nQuarterback\nFour-star Jonas Williams, No. 89 NATL.
