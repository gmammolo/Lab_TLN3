  "text": "Three new short courses will teach students why it is important to support gender equality and inclusion, and inform them about the government services for teenagers that are available on Diia.\nGender equality, inclusion, and Diia for teens: New courses launched on Mriia\nJune 12, 2025\nKyiv, 12 June 2025 – The educational application Mriia has launched three new educational series, “Gender Equality”, “Inclusivity,” and “Diia for Teens”.\nIn the three short courses, schoolchildren learn why it is important to support gender equality and inclusivity, and what public services are available for teenagers in Diia.\nThe educational series on gender equality consists of four episodes. It explains the difference between the basic concepts of sex and gender, and also explores the issue of stereotypes and the history of feminism and its goals. The series also analyses the situation in Ukraine and offers practical advice on how to support gender equality, and why this is important for everyone. The host of the series is Ukrainian journalist and Toronto Television host Max Shcherbyna.\nThe course “Inclusivity” is dedicated to the topic of barrier-free living and is designed to foster tolerant attitudes among teenagers. Using personal examples from the host, Tetiana Senchenko, who blogs about the life of a person with a disability, the series teaches students how to speak and interact with people with disabilities correctly, and what to avoid doing so as not to offend them.\nThe series “Diia for Teenagers” over four episodes describes all the digital opportunities available in the Diia application for teenagers: how the application works, what benefits it provides and how to register in it, how to get one’s first ID card and identification code, and what other services are available for minors. The course was also previously launched on the Diia.Education platform.\n“It’s important for teenagers to talk not only about formulas and dates, but also about how to be themselves, respect others, and understand the rules of living together. This is exactly the topic of the videos that have been put on Mriia thanks to cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine,” said Oleksandr Pavlenko, the co-director of Mriia. “The programme has supplemented the Content Library with over 5,000 items. From now on, the content is selected by an AI-based recommendation system — and each child sees content on the topics that interest and concern them the most.”\nSupporting young people is a key priority for the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine, said Olena Ursu, UNDP in Ukraine Democratic Governance Portfolio Team Leader.\n“Young people are the driving force behind Ukraine’s democratic and sustainable recovery and development,” she said. “It’s crucial that future generations understand people-centered principles – approaches that prioritise human needs in all decision-making processes. These educational programmes will equip young Ukrainians with knowledge about core democratic values like inclusiveness and gender equality, while connecting them to essential public services. This foundation will help build a Ukrainian society rooted in tolerance, mutual respect, and unwavering commitment to equal rights and opportunities for all.”\nThe courses were created with the support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine and funding from Sweden within the DIA Support Project.\nMedia inquiries:\nYuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Team Leader, yuliia.samus@undp.org",
