  "text": "The 12th grade history textbook will have an additional didactic support for studying the Holocaust and other sensitive topics from history, announced the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and Research, Valentina Olaru, during a thematic roundtable at the National Library, as reported by IPN.\nThe Secretary of State has stated that the teaching support will include a selection of relevant and complementary historical sources, accompanied by didactic and historical references for multi-perspective analysis of events and historical personalities. The teaching material will support teachers in responsibly teaching topics related to the Holocaust and other subjects from national history, as mentioned by the responsible person from the Ministry of Education.\nThe Ministry received the approval\nThe Ministry of Education has received the approval from the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel. According to Valentina Olaru, it expresses some conditions, but it does not mention that what is written in the manual is absolutely incorrect, condemnable and cannot be used for discussions or debates. Also, until now, the official approval from the National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania, “Elie Wiesel”, has not reached the Ministry.\nNational research institutions have issued favorable opinions, with the mention that the manual meets current educational requirements, promotes historical truth, and presents more information than previous editions on the topic of the Holocaust, crimes against humanity, and the situation in Bessarabia during the Second World War and the Transnistrian region.\nAt the same time, the director of the Jewish Community of Moldova, Aliona Grossu, mentions that the approval from Yad Vashem is not positive, stating that there are many critical aspects, relevant recommendations, and numerous errors, which have been brought to the attention of the Institute in Israel. “We believe that this textbook needs to be discontinued, and that it should be improved in terms of its coverage of Holocaust history, and if possible, we should also have a textbook competition”, declared the leader of the Jewish Community.\nThe historian Dr. Roman Rabinovici, curator of the Museum of Jewish History in Orhei, noted at the event that both factually and methodologically, the subject of the Holocaust is presented in the manual with numerous shortcomings.\n“The comments of the Elie Wiesel Institute, as well as the conclusions proposed by the Yad Vashem Institute (Israel), mention numerous distortions, gaps, factual errors, and incorrect interpretations of the events of that period found in the textbook. The Jewish community strongly recommended the withdrawal and revision of the textbook”, stated in a press release issued by the community after the event.\nSince September 2024, 12th grade students have new textbooks for the subject of Romanian and universal history.",
