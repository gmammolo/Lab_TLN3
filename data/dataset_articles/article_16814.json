  "text": "Editor’s note: In this article of a multipart series, the Post shares the story of Shieh Su Ying Scholar Athlete Award finalist Tera Mann - a student at the Academy of Our Lady of Guam and member of the National Honor Society. Mann won back-to-back softball championships with the Cougars and will be attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she received a full academic scholarship and will study mechanical engineering.\nTera Mann and the Academy of Our Lady of Guam Cougars didn’t win the high school championship in her first two years, but that didn’t deter the Shieh Su Ying finalist from dedicating herself even more to the game. Surrounded by supportive coaches and family members, she learned from her mentors and relatives and became a champion.\n“Coach Marissa Maratita-Matanane, coach Meagan Maratita and Russell Maratita inspired me to not be content with where I stand, for I am capable of so much more. They taught me respect and perseverance and more lessons in softball, but also in life,” said 18-year-old Tera Mann, who helped the Cougars win back-to-back softball championships in her junior and senior years. “Winning is always a great achievement, but more importantly than that, it is the way I play the game and show what the program is all about.”\nTera Mann, who is also an accomplished track and field athlete, quickly developed a love for sports. The more she dedicated herself - especially to softball - the more enjoyment she found. Sports were never something she felt pressured into. She truly loved playing and competing.\n“Balancing school and sports may be challenging, but having fun in what I do makes it easier. I chose sports that I loved participating in, so practices felt more like a time away from schoolwork rather than a chore that would only stress me out even more,” she said. “And when it came to my academics, I always reminded myself that to be a scholar-athlete means being a scholar before an athlete. While my sports would help shape my wellness and physical being throughout my life, my studies would prepare me for life in college and even after that.”\nTera Mann told The Guam Daily Post that her parents, Barry and Jean Mann, and other family members, “motivated me to do my best in school, which led to me graduating top 4 in my class,” she said. “The people closest to me remind me how important it is to finish my studies so that I can have a more fulfilling future with less financial struggles.”\nWith high school behind her and enrollment into the University of Wisconsin-Madison forthcoming, Tera Mann reflects fondly on her high school achievements, appreciative that Thomas Shieh, M.D., selected her as one of 16 finalists.\n“My athletics being balanced on top of my academics were recognized. I did my best to be as organized as I could, so I tried to get most of my homework done at school, so that I would not need to stay up so late doing work after my sports practices,” said Tera Mann, a member of the National Honor Society who received a full academic scholarship and will study mechanical engineering at UW-Madison.\nApart from academics and sports, Tera Mann dedicated countless hours to learning how to play multiple instruments and, as a commitment to community service, performed for the elderly.\n“On top of balancing sports and academics throughout high school, being instrumentally inclined - music-wise - has always been a big part of me,” Tera Mann said, who also taught herself how to play the guitar and ukulele. “Playing instruments not only gives me enjoyment, but it also refines and enhances my motor skills, builds my social connections and gives me a deeper appreciation for music.”",
