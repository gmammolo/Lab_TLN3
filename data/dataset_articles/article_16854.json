  "text": "- Light\nPublished: | By: Christian Helgert\nSource article\nThe Faculty of Physics and Astronomy together with the Abbe School of Photonics are proud to announce the start of a new international Master's degree program. The new M.Sc. Quantum Science & Technology is an all-English, two-year Master's degree course providing multidisciplinary coverage in the field of quantum sciences including quantum mechanics, information, communication, computing, imaging, sensing and further rising fields of quantum technology. The course schedule ranges from fundamental scientific subjects to application-oriented quantum engineering aspects.\nThe study course is designed to incorporate international students from different backgrounds. It aims to provide them with a solid knowledge of the quantum theory as well as the potential of quantum-related effects, both for academic research and for technological applications in industry. All lectures, courses and modules are taught completely in English. Students enrolled in the two-year program receive dedicated tutorial support and are trained for leading positions in the upcoming quantum challenges in industry and academia. Moreover, graduating the M.Sc. Quantum Science & Technology program offers a very direct way either to enter the local PhD program or to find a to enter the prestigious doctoral (PhD) program afterwards.\nThe new Master's degree course will already start in the winter term 2024/25 with its first lectures and seminars. Thus, interested applicants are invited to apply already now to secure sufficient time for obtaining an international student visa, if necessary.\nHands-on experience in the Quantum Laboratory Lab Course\nOne particular feature of the new research-oriented Master's degree course it that already in the first and second semester, students are offered a Quantum Lab Course. This specific module introduces quantum optics and related quantum technology in a phenomenological way, centered on particular experiments that show specific features or applications of non-classical light and other quantum systems. It contain hands-on experiences, where the students themselves perform quantum-optical experiments or program quantum algorithms, as well as classroom instruction. It is one rare example where students get such practical experience in quantum technology setups already during their Master studies. In the Quantum Laboratoratory Lab Course, students perform experiments on Quantum Computing, Quantum Cryptography, Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Imaging, and many others.\nAlbert-Einstein-Straße 6\n07745 Jena\nGoogle Maps site planExternal link\nAlbert-Einstein-Straße 6\n07745 Jena\nGoogle Maps site planExternal link",
