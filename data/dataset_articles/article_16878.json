  "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — CJ Ham is one of the longest tenured players for the Minnesota Vikings, but that doesn’t stop him from returning to Augustana each year to run the CJ Ham Football Camp. CJ Ham has been with the Vikings for the past ten seasons, earning two trips to the Pro Bowl and being named a team Captain. “To be with one team for a decade, it’s truly a blessing, only a story God could write,” Ham said. “Every single year, I get to sit back, reflect and be grateful. Grateful for the opportunities that have come to me and grateful to be where I’m at.” CJ graduated from Augustana following a standout career, but one of the biggest takeaways from his time in Sioux Falls, came from his coach, Jerry Olszewski. “His coaching style of it’s bigger than football, caring about the individual more than the results. I think that’s something that he’s instilled in me,” Ham said. “I think that’s something that goes with me and my family’s approach when it comes to giving back to the community and being there for other people.” That attitude was on full display Saturday as Ham partnered with Augustana for the CJ Ham Football Camp. 250 kids grades first through eighth got the chance to work Ham and several athletes from Augie. “What’s been on my heart is attitude. Control what you can control. There’s so many things that happen in our life that are out of our control,” Ham said. “If we think we can control everything, it’s going to be tough. We can control out attitudes and how we react.” Working the youth of the area is a big benefit of the camp, but Ham also relishes the opportunity to return to a special place. “My wife and I think about this is where our family started. This is where I met my wife. This is where I got my education,” Ham said. “Sioux Falls truly, truly is like a home to me. This is some place that down in the future, we can see ourselves living.” Training camp begins in July for the Vikings, with their first preseason game set for August 9th.
