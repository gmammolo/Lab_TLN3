  "text": "June 12, 2025\nCAMAS, WA, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Dana Christiansen has been selected for inclusion in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nMs. Christiansen is a distinguished expert in childcare and child development, with a career spanning over three decades. As the owner and director of Tree Hill Learning Center since 2009, she has demonstrated exceptional leadership and dedication to the field of childcare. Her journey began with her early exposure to the industry through her father's pioneering work in child development, which inspired her to pursue a career in this domain. Her expertise is further evidenced by her active involvement with the Washington State Childcare Centers Association and the Early Learning Action Alliance steering committee, where she plays a crucial role in advocacy and legislative efforts.\nPrior to her current role, Ms. Christiansen spent about two years working with Child Protective Services, where she honed her skills in child welfare and protection. This experience provided her with invaluable insights into the challenges faced by children and families, further fueling her passion for making a difference in their lives. Her commitment to advocacy is evident in her extensive work with state legislators and regulatory agencies, where she collaborates on rule-making and licensing matters. Her political work has earned her several write-ups in various publications. Early on in her career, she became a director and purchased her first childcare center in Eugene, Oregon, at the young age of 25.\nReflecting on her career, Ms. Christiansen's most significant accomplishment was the successful launch of an additional childcare center during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite global uncertainty, she made the bold decision to proceed with construction in March 2020, immediately after returning from a family trip. Through determined collaboration with her builder, the center opened just one month behind schedule. She personally conducted tours during evenings and weekends, filling the center within six months. Today, her schools are among the most sought-after in the area, with waiting lists extending up to two years.\nMs. Christiansen's educational background includes a Bachelor of Arts in child and family studies with a specialization in administration from Portland State University, completed in 1997. Beyond her education, she attributes much of her success to the mentorship of her father, whose guidance was instrumental in shaping her career path. She also gives credit to her political advocacy, which has facilitated networking and provided her with a deep understanding of the system.\nIn addition to her professional accomplishments, Ms. Christiansen founded the Tree Hill Family Foundation in 2023. The foundation focuses on providing scholarships for high school students and current staff pursuing careers in early childhood education and supporting foster parents facing financial barriers to adoption.\nOutside of her professional endeavors, Ms. Christiansen enjoys spending time with her family, boating, hiking and exploring the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. She also prioritizes spending time with her family, including her husband, three children and stepson.\nAnticipating her professional future, Ms. Christiansen aspires to expand her childcare brand by opening additional centers and is considering pursuing a role as a state representative in Washington. She believes that such a position would allow her to make a significant impact on children's lives across the state, furthering her lifelong commitment to advocacy and child development.\nAbout Marquis Who's Who®:\nSince 1899, when A.
