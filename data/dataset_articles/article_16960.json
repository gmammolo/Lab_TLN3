  "text": "Law Firm Ready (LFR) invites application from undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in a BCI-approved law college for the16th Batch of its six-week mentorship programme.\nLFR, an initiative started in 2021, has supported legal professionals over 650 law schools, particularly those from under-resourced law schools, by providing them with essential tools and resources.\nThey conduct sessions around skill training, foundational learning, research guidance, career counselling, peer learning, mental health support, and exposure on emerging legal careers.\nLFR's goal is to build an effective bridge, reducing the gap between well-resourced and under-resourced law schools.\nLFR's mentorship programs offer one-on-one guidance to law students from under-resourced law schools. Mentees are encouraged to ask their Mentors any questions related to law school life, careers, or other concerns, and mentors will provide valuable guidance on how to move forward.\nThey organize ten weekly sessions on topics such as:\n● CV and cover letter drafting: Learn the basics of building your internship application from the renowned speakers during this session.\n● Introduction to General Corporate and M&A: LFR helps you understand the concepts of General Corporate, Private Equity and Mergers & Acquisitions, clarifying their interrelationships and distinctions.\n● Introduction to Litigation and ADR: In this session, we explore what litigation, arbitration and mediation actually look like in real life. We talk about the roles lawyers play, the differences between them, and the many paths you can take.\n● Introduction to Legal Research: Research is half of what a law student does and most of what a lawyer needs. From moots and research papers to internships and jobs, strong research skills are non-negotiable. This session helps build a smarter, faster approach to legal research that saves time, boosts clarity, and delivers better results.\n● Emerging careers after law: During this session, discover the vast array of career opportunities, like data protection, and public policy, available to you beyond conventional paths like litigation and corporate law.\n● Public Speaking for Law Students: Whether it's moots, interviews, or courtrooms, clear and confident speaking sets you apart. This session helps you find your voice, structure your thoughts, and speak like a future lawyer. No fluff, just real, practical tips to help you own the room.\n● AI Tools for Lawyers: LFR will teach law students how AI can bridge language barriers, improve drafting, and connect lawyers with the best minds, helping them unlock their full potential.\n● Navigating law school and building a support network: This session is an open space for law students to share, be heard, and co-learn as LFR addresses challenges like career anxiety, relationships, and confidence.\n● Capstone Project: A hands-on experience where law students work in teams to solve a complex, real-life legal problem. It’s all about applying what you’ve learned, sharpening your problem-solving skills, and thinking like a lawyer in the real world.\nThe candidate must be an undergraduate/ postgraduate student from a Bar Council of India (BCI) - approved law college.\nThe duration of the mentorship shall be six weeks.\nThis is a remote mentorship programme, and all correspondence with the selected mentees shall be made through emails and other formal mediums.\nTo register, fill out this Google Form.\nBased on responses, LFR will select students from the applications they receive. Shortlisted candidates will be invited for a telephonic or virtual interaction\nIf a candidate is provisionally selected, they will receive an acceptance mail.\nFor any queries, feel free to email lawfirmready@gmail.com\nOr reach out to Nidhi at +91 9685730843\n<Sponsored by the Brand>",
