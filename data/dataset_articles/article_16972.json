  "text": "MECC Implements Training Program For Doha University Students\nMENAFN- The Peninsula) The Peninsula\nDoha: As part of its ongoing efforts to raise environmental awareness and enhance scientific knowledge among youth, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MECC), represented by the Radiation Protection Department, organized a specialized training program for students of Doha University for Science and Technology. The program was held in Doha from May 15 to 31, 2025.\nThe aim of the program was to introduce students to the fundamental principles of radiation protection and its applications in scientific and professional fields. It included a series of specialized lectures covering the nature of radiation, types and sources of radioactive materials, and safe handling practices.\nThe program also featured practical demonstrations of radiation detection and analysis equipment used in the Radiation Measurement Laboratory, along with how these tools are employed in environmental monitoring and scientific assessment.\nAs part of the program, a field tour was organized at the Radiation Protection Department, allowing students to explore the technical and operational divisions and learn about ongoing projects-particularly those implemented in collaboration with international organizations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in areas of training and technical cooperation.\nThis training initiative is part of a broader series of activities carried out by the Ministry in cooperation with academic institutions across the country. It aims to instill a culture of radiation safety and promote protection principles as a core component of environmental sustainability strategies.\nThe program reflects the Ministry's commitment to preparing and empowering young national talents to keep pace with scientific advancements, in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 and its ongoing pursuit to elevate environmental protection standards in accordance with the highest international benchmarks.\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the\ninformation “as is” without warranty of any kind.
