  "text": "June 12, 2025\nLITTLETON, CO, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Karl R. Langas has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nMr. Langas, a recently retired software engineering senior manager, has made significant contributions to the field of embedded software engineering for complex systems. With an impressive career spanning over 40 years, he leveraged his expertise and leadership on projects involving strategic and missile defense, commercial and military satellite development and space exploration. Furthermore, he has showcased his exceptional ability to collaborate with teams in tackling complex challenges to achieve mission success. Mr. Langas' professional journey began at Martin Marietta Corporation in 1984, right before the merger with Lockheed.\nInitially, Mr. Langas honed his skills in operational software development. Over the years, he played a pivotal role as the certified principal engineer for multiple missions, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter initiative, which remains operational today. In 2020, Mr. Langas transitioned to Lockheed Martin as a software engineering senior manager. During his tenure, he led the OSIRIS-REx program, a project that required innovative solutions to land on an asteroid. His creative implementation of a camera system provided crucial guidance during the spacecraft's descent, marking one of his most significant achievements.\nAdditionally, Mr. Langas contributed to the Juno spacecraft program developed in collaboration with the Goddard Space Flight Center. Beyond deep space exploration, he expanded his expertise to commercial systems at Lockheed Martin. Notably, he was instrumental in developing a software product line supporting large communication satellites for industry and government use, and his team successfully sold several satellites internationally and created the Space-Based Infrared System for missile launch detection, which was later deployed by the United States government. For his contributions over the years, he has been the recipient of various achievement awards.\nAll in all, Mr. Langas attributes his success to his determination and focus on building strong relationships with others. Moreover, his academic background laid a strong foundation for his career accomplishments. He earned a Bachelor of Science in computer information systems from Arizona State University and a Master of Science in software engineering from the University of Denver, both of which equipped him with the technical knowledge and problem-solving skills necessary to tackle complex challenges throughout his career.\nIn addition to his professional achievements, Mr. Langas has been actively involved as a youth basketball coach. His involvement in and love of sports goes way back to his adolescence when he was recognized as a state champion swimmer. As a devoted family man with one son and twin daughters, he enjoys watching his children's games.
