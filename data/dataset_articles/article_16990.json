  "text": "June 12, 2025\nGARDEN CITY, ID, June 12, 2025 /24-7PressRelease/ -- John A. DeMartino has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nMr. DeMartino is the owner of MAAX Family Financial, a company he founded in 2022. His journey into entrepreneurship was inspired by his desire to assist others in achieving financial independence. This venture allows him to educate individuals on financial matters, a passion that emerged as he transitioned to a remote lifestyle alongside his wife, who is a travel nurse. Notably, the flexibility of remote work enabled Mr. DeMartino to connect with those seeking financial guidance, ultimately leading to the creation of his company.\nBefore establishing MAAX Family Financial, Mr. DeMartino worked in a multitude of different industries, from insurance (Vertafore) to biometrics (Thales) to real estate (NAI capital). This diverse background has given him a unique perspective on how economics are treated across different industries. His professional experience and his recent travels have opened up the world of financial coaching, allowing him to assist others in becoming financially independent.\nEducationally, Mr. DeMartino holds a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from California State University, Fullerton, which has equipped him with insights into human behavior and decision-making processes—skills that are invaluable in his current role. Moreover, he obtained an associate degree in fire science and firefighting from Los Angeles Valley College and an Associate of Arts in general education from Golden West College. In addition to his formal education, Mr. DeMartino has pursued numerous certifications through LinkedIn, including communication tips, learning ServiceNow, and time management for remote work, among others. These certifications reflect his commitment to continuous learning and professional development.\nIn reflecting on his journey, Mr. DeMartino attributes his success to perseverance and determination, along with the guidance of influential mentors throughout his career. From his experience, he emphasizes that anything is possible if individuals find and properly use the available tools. He firmly believes that many individuals possess talent; they just need to learn how to harness it. He is now sharing this information at maaxfamilyfinancial.com.\nOutside of his professional life, Mr. DeMartino enjoys fitness and health activities, learning new skills and engaging with podcasts and audiobooks. Looking ahead, his primary objective is to raise awareness about the resources offered through his business, MAAX Family Financial: a company whose mission is to help educate those who do not have the resources to research finance and help them not go into debt. Through his website, he aims to ensure more individuals are informed about the availability of such financial education resources. Overall, he is driven by his belief that a solid financial structure has the potential to transform the world.\nAbout Marquis Who's Who®:\nSince 1899, when A. N.
