  "text": "Books\nsummary\nWhy This Classic Book Should Be Required Reading for Everyone Feeling Lost in Their 20s\n'Demian' by Hermann Hesse follows Emil Sinclair’s journey through confusion, identity crises, and spiritual awakening. Guided by the enigmatic Demian, Sinclair navigates the grey areas of morality and selfhood. This introspective novel resonates deeply with anyone in their twenties grappling with who they are and where they’re headed.\nWhy This Classic Book Should Be Required Reading for Everyone Feeling Lost in Their 20s (Picture Credit - Instagram)\nWhen you’re 20-something, the world feels like a blur. You’re told to chase success, but no one hands you a compass. That’s where '\nDemian' by Hermann Hessecomes in. A story that feels like it’s speaking directly to the soul of a generation unsure of who they are.\nThe Novel That Understands You Before You Understand Yourself\n'Demian', first published in 1919, isn’t just a coming-of-age novel — it’s a philosophical mirror. Through the character of Emil Sinclair, Hesse captures the intense confusion and search for identity that defines the early twenties. Sinclair, like many of us, lives in two worlds: one clean and orderly, the other dark and real. His journey to merge these worlds reflects the emotional turbulence of youth.\nIn your twenties, you start to realise that life isn’t binary. Right and wrong blur. Career paths twist. Friendships shift. Sinclair’s internal struggle feels deeply personal. When he meets the mysterious Demian — a character who challenges everything he knows, it’s like that moment you meet someone who cracks open your thinking and makes you question what you’ve accepted blindly.\nDemian Doesn’t Offer Answers, But It Gives You Permission to Ask\nOne of the most powerful things about Demian is that it never pretends to give you a roadmap. It doesn’t tell you who you should be. Instead, it encourages you to start asking the real questions:\nWhat if everything I believed was someone else’s idea of the truth?\nWhat if being lost is actually the first step to finding something deeper?\nIn your twenties, you’re bombarded with expectations — from parents, society, even your Instagram feed. Hesse’s novel whispers, “It’s okay to walk away from all of it.” That’s not an easy message to hear, but it’s the one many need, especially when you’re stuck between what the world wants from you and what your gut is quietly trying to say.\nA Spiritual Wake-Up Call for the Sceptical\nWhile the novel dives into religion, mysticism, and symbols like Abraxas — a god that embodies both good and evil, it isn’t preachy. Instead, it forces you to look inward. Hesse was heavily influenced by\nCarl Jung, and 'Demian' often feels like a psychological excavation. It gets under your skin, but gently.\nFor someone in their twenties, who’s becoming painfully aware that the answers aren’t in textbooks or motivational podcasts, this novel says: the search is the answer.\nThe Feeling of Finding a Book That Feels Like a Friend\nWe’ve all had those nights — lying awake, wondering if we’re doing life wrong. Sinclair’s loneliness, confusion, and inner conflict will resonate with anyone who’s ever felt disconnected in a crowded room or unsure while achieving what they’re “supposed” to want. Hesse doesn’t romanticise pain, but he honours it.\nReading 'Demian' feels like finally sitting with someone who doesn’t try to fix you. Who simply says, “I’ve been there too.”\nWhy It Still Matters Over a Century Later\nIt’s easy to think that a novel written in 1919 couldn’t possibly relate to your modern problems. But 'Demian' transcends time. The battle between conformity and individuality, the search for purpose, the ache of self-discovery — they’re timeless themes. Today’s twenty-somethings may express their crisis through\nTikToktrends or burnout memes, but the soul-questions remain the same.\nHesse reminds us that the pain of becoming isn’t new, but it’s always meaningful.\nIf you’re in your twenties and feel like you’re drowning in choices, doubt, or quiet despair, Demian won’t hand you a life plan. What it will do is awaken something in you — a kind of quiet knowing that maybe, just maybe, feeling lost isn’t the problem. Maybe it’s the beginning of becoming.\nThis book isn’t for the faint-hearted. But if you’re ready to see yourself honestly, confront your contradictions, and start walking your own path, 'Demian' is the guide you didn’t know you needed.\nGirish Shukla author\nA dedicated bibliophile with a love for psychology and mythology, I am the author of two captivating novels.
