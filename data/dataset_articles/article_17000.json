  "text": "Yusuf Çifci, who came to the world's attention with his groundbreaking work titled \"Political Psychology I: Political Mental Illnesses\", has made a name for himself in many international publications.\nThe work titled “Political Psychology I: Political Mental Illnesses” written by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Yusuf Çifci and published in collaboration with Sayda Kitap Publishing House, quickly garnered a wide response not only in Türkiye but also in the world press. Sections from the work were included in news published in more than ten countries, including America, France, and England, under the title “Here are the common points of Hitler, Putin, and Trump, according to a study conducted by a psychology researcher.”\nAddressing Turkish readers with the question, “Are you ready to embark on a journey into the subconscious of the state?”, the work places the concept of “state” on Freud’s couch and approaches the psychological pathologies that develop in the triangle of individual-society-state from a political perspective. Psychological analyses conducted on the political pasts of Adolf Hitler, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump shed light on the effects of leaders’ early childhood traumas on their passion for power.\nÇifci's academic courage and striking interpretations are considered to be one of the rare studies that maintains its objectivity and brings together the disciplines of politics and psychology. This success has made him the sixth Turk to be mentioned in Forbes and has brought him to an important position on the international intellectual scene.\nWho is Assoc.
