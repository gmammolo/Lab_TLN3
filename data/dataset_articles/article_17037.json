  "text": "Campus Life\nSeptember 18, 2025 by\nOur Reporter\nUNILAG alumni to build 1,800 bed hostel for students\n- Hails Tinubu for Student Loan Scheme\nThe University of Lagos (UNILAG) Alumni Association has intensified efforts to construct a 1,800-bed hostel for students.\nAddressing journalists at a press briefing to announce activities for its forthcoming Dinner and Award Night, President Worldwide of the association, Ifeoluwa Oyedele, noted that in a few weeks the association would lay the foundation stone for the construction of the hostel which is expected to be completed within 18 months.\nThe 55th Anniversary Awards and Recognition Dinner will be held Friday, 17th October 2025, at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\nHe emphasised the importance of alumni associations, stressing that the government alone is incapable of running education.\nHe praised President Bola Tinubu for his special attention to the funding of education and the introduction of novel innovations to improve the quality of education at all levels, citing the introduction of the Nigerian Education Loan Fund (NELFUND) to provide loans for students in tertiary schools.\n“In addition, the government of President Tinubu recently offered full scholarships to students of vocational and technical colleges. The government has also increased the percentage of the budget allocation to the education sector in the midst of various other needs,” he said.\nOyedele said over the years, the UNILAG alumni association has carried out many interventions including giving scholarships and mentorship support for countless students, donated equipment and resources that improve research and teaching, constructed new facilities and renovated existing classrooms, lecture halls and students hostels.\nRead Also: FG disburses N330bn to households under social protection Programme\nHe said the association is determined to do more and as such envisions a UNILAG where classrooms and laboratories are centres of innovation, not relics of neglect; where technology drives teaching and research, making UNILAG competitive globally and engagement and commitment to sustaining excellence.\nOn the Dinner and Award Night, Oyedele said the event would be an avenue to mobilise support for projects that will touch lives and improve the quality of education in the university.\nHe said the Vice President, Kashim Shettima is special guest of honour, while the chairman of the occasion is Dr Sonny Kuku, Ogbeni Oja of Ijebuland,among others.\nThe 2nd Vice President and Chairman of the 55th Anniversary, Otunba Lekan Ajisafe,explained that the Awards and Recognition Dinner is the second phase of the event which started last year.\n“Great Nigerians have been carefully selected for their contributions to education, society, and University of Lagos. Let me inform you that the award is for only deserving Nigerians. We want people to know that investment in education is not a waste but national building,” he said.\nLifetime achievement award will be presented to Chairman, Premier Loto Ltd, Chief Kessington Adebukunola Adebutu, Life Director, Folawiyo Group, Chief Tunde Fanimokun and Senate Majority Leader, Dr Michael Opeyemi Bamidele.",
