  "text": "Education\nSeptember 18, 2025 by\nOur Reporter\nLASU celebrates ‘ethics don’ with retirement lecture\n- By Glorious Idowu and Christiana Ohimai\nIt is often said that humility is the foundation of learning.\nThe retiring former Head of Department of Journalism and former Postgraduate School Coordinator, Faculty of Communication and Media Studies, Lagos State University (LASU), Prof. Olujimi ‘Jimmy K’ Kayode, must have borrowed this maxim as his cardinal character.\nOn Wednesday, September 10, the LASU community gathered not just to honour the brilliant academic retiring at 72, but to celebrate a man whose profound impact is matched only by his deep humility. The air was filled with stories; not just of his scholarly publications, but of his character.\nA quick search will show you a list of his formidable qualifications, a CV that could easily intimidate emeritus professors. But to meet Prof. Kayode in person is to meet a calm, gentle man whose simplicity is his true signature.\nWhen our correspondents waited in his office and he walked in, the man popularly known as ‘Jimmy K’ greeted them warmly, and they had no idea he was the professor they were there to see.\nA fitting lecture\nThe central theme of the lecture to celebrate the retiring, but not tired lecturer was: “The Imperative of Communication Ethics in the Digital Age”. The celebration featured a panel session focused on ethics, a choice directly tied to the core of Professor Kayode’s identity.\nRead Also: FG disburses N330bn to households under social protection Programme\nExplaining this, the Dean of the Faculty of Communication and Media Studies, Prof. Jide Peter Jimoh, said: “As a professor, you ought to be known for one particular area of study. Your PhD will define something and your professorship will also make you. You are not just a professor; you are a professor of something.\n“For him,” the dean continued, “the major part of his scholarship has been in ethics; ethics of journalism. That is why we picked it. He studied how our professional and ethical standards impact society; what ethical things you must consider before reporting.”\nProf. Jimoh elaborated on the practical nature of ‘Jimmy K’s’ work, which provided a moral compass for the profession: tackling dilemmas like how to report conflict without escalating it and the ethical boundaries of accepting gifts.\n“He has traversed all of those areas and has given us publications. So, that is why we are celebrating the ethical part of him. But he’s bigger than that, really.”\nBeyond the scholarship, the dean emphasised the man’s extraordinary humility and friendliness.\n“He does not have this overhang of, ‘I’m a professor.’ He is so ordinary. He relates with people as human beings first; not as a senior to a junior.\n“He is highly credentialed but he doesn’t walk with it. He doesn’t consider it anything big. That is what we are celebrating about him.”\nThe event, attended by his beautiful wife, numerous professors, and admirers, was a wave of gratitude. Moved by the tributes, Prof. Kayode simply said, “I just want to thank everybody for even thinking about doing this for me. I’m grateful.”\nThe university presented him with a monetary gift as a token of appreciation. That was quickly supplemented by a flood of personal gifts from those whose lives he had touched.\nIt was a final, fitting testament to a selfless man, who loved God, loved giving, and whose favourite birthday gift to give is a Bible.\nRetired but not tired\nWhen asked about his retirement, the man himself was characteristically straightforward. He revealed that his recent sabbatical seamlessly transitioned into his retirement as he turned 72.\n“That was the preparation,” he said with a smile.\nBut for Prof. Kayode, retirement is not an end. “I’m retiring, but I’m not tired,” he declared, outlining plans to continue teaching as a visiting professor. He described teaching not as a job, but as a calling. “The fact that I always love to see students make it; that’s what really drives me. That’s my pride. I’ve taught students who have become deputy governors, vice chancellors…”\nHis advice to the younger generations was heartfelt and practical.\nOn ethics, he said: “Ethical dilemmas will always come. Make sure that whatever you do, you can justify it. Stay with your conscience.” On life: “Be friendly with everybody. Then, you won’t have enemies.”\nAnd his ultimate words of wisdom, he said: “Pray for your enemies. Do good to those who hate you. Pray for your enemies and do good to them that hate you.” He emphasized that these values have guided him throughout his career.\nProfessor Kayode attributed his drive to see students succeed as a key motivator in his teaching career. He described teaching as a calling, similar to the ministry, and takes pride in having mentored students, who have gone on to achieve great things.\nOn the topic of ethical dilemmas, Prof. Kayode advised individuals to make justifiable decisions based on truth and conscience. He emphasised the importance of being able to justify one’s actions and decisions.\nProfessor Kayode expressed contentment with his life and career, stating that he has never had significant challenges and is proud of the impact he has made through his teaching.\nA man with rich background\nProf. Kayode’s background includes working at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism, the civil service, and the private sector. His impressive CV is a testament to his dedication to his craft. His commitment to mentoring and teaching has had a lasting impact on the field of journalism.\nA renowned journalism educator, ethicist, and moralist, he has had a distinguished career spanning over four decades.\nBorn on August 26, 1955, in Surulere, Lagos, Prof. Kayode has made significant contributions to the field of mass communication, particularly in public relations and advertising.\nHe graduated with a second-class upper division in Mass Communication from the University of Lagos in 1980. He later earned his master’s degree in Mass Communication from the same university in 1985, focusing on Public Relations and Advertising. In 2015, he earned his Ph.D. in Mass Communication from the same university.\nProfessor Kayode has held various positions, including Acting Director of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism and Acting Head of the Department of Public Relations and Advertising at Lagos State University. He has also served as an adjunct lecturer at numerous universities in Nigeria and as an external examiner for several universities in Southern African countries.\nHe received an award recognising his outstanding teaching in journalism from the Poynter Institute of Media Studies in Florida, USA, in 1991. He has participated in training programmes both within Nigeria and internationally, including journalism training and a teaching fellowship in newspaper design at the Poynter Institute of Media Studies.\nProfessor Kayode is a prolific author, having published over 50 articles in top local and international academic journals and book chapters. He has also authored the e-book “Marketing Communication” published by bookboon.com.",
