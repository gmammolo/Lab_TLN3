  "text": "By Maria Dibut Galera ,\n5 hours ago\nLas Vegas(KLAS)-In partnership with the Atomic Museum, the Desert Research Institute is launching a new, innovative and accessible field trip program. The program is designed to ignite curiosity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as well as connect students to Nevada’s rich history. The field trip includes free admission to the museum and transportation for participants.\nThe two-and-a-half-hour field trip is open to 6th-12th grade students. It includes a guided tour of Atomic Museum exhibits as well as a hands-on science lab conducted by DRI. During the lab, students will participate in interactive experiments that explore the fundamentals of radiation science and its role in history, technology and everyday life.\nThe program is available on select Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at the Atomic Museum and DRI campus, beginning at 9:30 a.m. and concluding at 12 p.m.\nFor more information visit: tinyurl.com/radiationscience.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
