  "text": "By Tom Rimback ,\n5 hours ago\nThe New Jersey State Interscholastic Athlete Association has taken a stand against blowouts in high school basketball. At its first executive committee meeting of the 2025-26 school year, the NJSIAA addressed competitive inequities on the winter hardwoods.\nThe committee enacted a statewide 'mercy rule' that will be in effect beginning this season for girls and boys basketball. When a team had built a lead of 35 points or more at any point of the second half, a running clock will begin at that point.\nOnce the rule goes into effect during a game, the clock will stop for timeouts, technical fouls, injuries and any instance when an official determined the clock should stop. The rule remains in effect in the third and fourth quarters. If overtime is necessary, regular timing rules will be used.\nMercy rules are familiar to South Jersey basketball fans as the Burlington County Scholastic and Cape-Atlantic leagues have used versions of the 35-point rule for its league games. NJSIAA executive director Colleen Maguire referenced sportsmanship and consistency across the state as the primary impetus for enacting the new rule.\nThe rule will be in effect for all regular season and both in-season and post-season tournament play.\nThe NJSIAA has versions of a mercy rule in baseball, softball, field hockey, football plus both boys and girls versions for soccer, lacrosse and ice hockey.\nTom Rimback grew up reading the Burlington County Times and Courier Post sports sections and began writing for the BCT in 1996. He has covered everything from Super Bowls and Final Fours to Tri-County Swimming but he’s happiest on a sideline interviewing South Jersey scholastic athletes. Follow him on twitter @Rimbacksports.
