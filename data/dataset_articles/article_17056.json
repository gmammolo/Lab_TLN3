  "text": "Philadelphia (Pa.) Neumann Goretti cornerback Jelane Richardson impressed the Penn State staff during a 7-on-7 team camp in State College during the summer and his performance led to cornerbacks coach Terry Smith issuing an early offer to the in-state standout.\nRichardson has stayed in contact with Smith and the Penn State staff since that offer was issued. Strong relationships have been built and those relationships are a big reason why the 2027 cornerback is planning on returning to State College to attend the annual White Out game against Oregon on Sept. 27.\nRichardson also wants to experience a White Out environment for himself.",
