  "text": "CHICO, Calif. — The Beta Theta Pi Fraternity at Chico State has made its return following its disbandment in 2007. The reinstatement brings with it a renewed perspective and marks the introduction of its first new class in 18 years.\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE | Chico State's Beta Theta Pi alumni reunite, celebrate legacy and future return in 2025\n“We’re excited to be back. Beta was a mainstay here in Chico for many years in the Greek system, so bringing this back, the excitement, the prep, coming full force, has been fantastic,\" said Jason Sherwood, Alumni Advisor of the Betas Association.\nThe Betas are known for their commitment to cultivating 'Men of Principle.' The organization places a strong emphasis on engaging in philanthropic work within the community, striving to make a positive impact through various service initiatives. Additionally, academic excellence is a cornerstone of the Betas’ values, encouraging members to pursue their studies with diligence and integrity.\nFor the incoming members of Beta, the return marks the beginning of an exciting journey. It presents a unique opportunity not only to honor and uphold the rich legacy established by those who came before them but also to forge their own path and contribute to the evolution of the organization.\n“What we’re looking for is really young men that want to be part of building something, not just joining something, but really creating that foundation and shaping it for what Chico Betas will be going forward,\" said Chris Balck, on the Board of Directors for the Chico Betas Alumni Association and Communications Director.\nSo far, over 75 men have participated in Rush Week, taking the opportunity to connect with alumni and explore the history of the fraternity. Potential new members have the opportunity to ask questions and discover what being part of the Beta brotherhood entails.\nWhile hazing is a common stereotype associated with fraternities, alumni stress that Chico State has implemented a strict \"no hazing\" policy. This commitment to creating a safe and welcoming environment is echoed throughout the national Beta Theta Pi organization, ensuring that all members can focus on building relationships and fostering personal growth without the pressure of hazing rituals.\n“We’re going to educate them on our national fraternity, we’re going to educate them on who Chico Betas were, but hazing will not be part of that,\" Balck explained to KRCR.\nFormer members of the fraternity will offer their support and guidance to new pledges as they navigate the process of reintegrating into campus. To further enhance the transition, a representative from the national Beta Theta Pi organization will live in the newly established Beta house on 4th Street for the entire first year. The representative will play a pivotal role in mentoring the pledges and ensuring a smooth and successful return to fraternity activities.\n“Just building a Greek community that succeeds well and looks great amongst other different organizations that aren’t greek on campus is something that I really want to bring,\" said Nathan Torner, Chapter Development Consultant for Beta Theta Pi National\nMembers of the Beta fraternity proudly share with KRCR that their experience within the brotherhood has enriched their lives in significant ways. Beyond fostering deep and lasting friendships, being part of the close-knit community has opened doors to valuable networking opportunities with fellow alumni from various chapters far beyond Chico State.\n“The network when you’re out of school is enormous because it’s not just the Chico Beta Theta Pi alumni, but it’s the Beta Theta Pi from all campuses,\" said Alan Maxwell, on the Board of Directors for the Chico Betas Alumni Association\nStudents are filled with excitement as they rush Beta, sharing enthusiasm with alumni who fondly remember their own experiences. They look forward to joining the brotherhood and create lasting bonds.\n“My dad was in the Betas when he was at Chico, so he was an alumni and he was telling me about it and getting me kind of involved with it,\" explained third year Chico State student and rushee.\nAdditionally, students that are rushing say they're also looking forward to engaging in initiatives that extend beyond the Chico State campus. By participating in community service projects, leadership opportunities, and social events, they say they hope to make a meaningful difference in the community.\n“As I’ve gotten older at Chico State, I wanted something that will last a little longer. Me and my friends, our group, kind of realized that if we did something newer, something that could have a more positive impact with the actual community of Chico and not just the school, we could build on something that could last a lot longer,\" said Oscar Bloom, third year Chico State student and rushee.\nBids will be distributed on Friday, and the first event with new members and alumni will take place on Saturday.\nTo learn more about the Chico Betas, click here.",
