  "text": "ALMONT — The Almont Community Historical Society, during the Almont Heritage Festival to be held Sept. 19-21, will include the return of guided tours through the Almont National Historic District.\nThis year, participants will have the opportunity to enjoy 30-minute motorized tours via golf carts, departing from the historical museum at 149 S. Main St. in downtown Almont on Saturday, Sept. 20 from 9 a.m. to 3:30 pm. Pre-registration is recommended to secure a spot; each tour accommodates up to four passengers. Should any slots remain available on the day of the event, tours will be offered on a first-come, first-served basis.\nDeparting every half hour, the tour follows the historic Detroit Interurban Railway route to West St. Clair, providing insight into several notable homes within the tree-lined National Historic District. The tour proceeds to the Bells, and then circles back to the location where the renowned Native American Treaty Tree once stood. It continues past the Henry Stephens Library and Burley Park before returning to Muir’s Funeral Home. A volunteer driver and guide will be available to answer any questions along the way. This tour operates on a freewill donation basis; all contributions are determined by participants and will support the Almont Community Historical Society’s 2026 Living History Village, which is being brought to Almont next year. Preregistration is available at the Almont Library, Roots or Maria’s on the Main during their business hours.\nIf people become a new member of the historical society ($15 a year) during the month of September, they will be entered into a grand prize drawing for a chance to win a pair of Meadow Brook Theatre tickets. The drawing will be held at 6:30 p.m. at Maria’s on the Main during the historical society’s spaghetti dinner fundraiser on Sept. 30. The dinner is from 5-7:30 p.m. Membership forms will be available during the tours, at the museum and at door the night of the spaghetti dinner.\nThe dinner and tours are both free will donations and all monies go toward the various programs the museum is bringing in 2026. Historical society member Gary Kimery will offer his taxi service on behalf of the museum fundraising effort during Heritage Days.",
