  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Thousands of students from across South Texas gathered at the Richard M. Borchard Regional Fairgrounds on Wednesday for the You! Choose Career Expo, an event aimed at connecting young people with opportunities in the region.\nMore than 47 schools bused in students to learn about careers in fields ranging from technology and health care to skilled trades. Organizers said the expo was designed to highlight the range of opportunities available in the Coastal Bend and encourage students to pursue futures close to home.\nCarroll High School senior Nicolas Martinez attended the event with plans to study medicine.\n“I’m very blessed to have gotten this opportunity,\" he said. \"I’m very proud to be chosen to come here and see all these places.\"\nWorkforce officials added that the event is part of a broader effort to strengthen the local talent pipeline by showing students that many career paths can begin right in South Texas.\nMore from 3NEWS on KIIITV.com:\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for your daily news and exclusive extended interviews.\nDo you have a news tip?
