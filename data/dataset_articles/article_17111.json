  "text": "WAVERLY, Iowa — The top track team on our countdown is the #4 college team of the century: the 2012 Wartburg women's track and field squad.\nIn the midst of winning the indoor and outdoor DIII national meets, the Knights scored 99 and 70 points respectively. The 70 points are an all-time record for the DIII national meet, and those 99 points are the most since the mid-1980s.\nAt the IIAC conference meets, the Knights scored over 300 points-something that's never been done before or since.\nThe Knights had a combined 9 national champion events, and 27 top-5 finishes.\nThis year we're celebrating the best of the best from the sports world in Eastern Iowa over the last 25 years. The over-arcing theme of this series will be \"The Stories of the Century\". During this year, we'll count down the top 25 athletes, coaches, and teams from the past 25 years.\nThe year will be divided up into fourths, with the first portion of the year being dedicated to the best teams (both high school and college) from the last 25 years.\nEvery Monday we'll be releasing two more prep teams, and every Wednesday we'll announce two college teams who will be added to the list.",
