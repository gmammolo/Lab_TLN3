  "text": "MANILA– In a country where educational opportunities can be a challenge for many, the “SCG Sharing the Dream” program stands out as a beacon of hope, providing a pathway to a brighter future for deserving students. Since its launch in 2008, this scholarship initiative has been dedicated to supporting young Filipinos who demonstrate a strong academic record and a deep sense of gratitude to their families.\nThis 2025, SCG proudly granted scholarships to 250 high school students and 40 college students, including school supplies, allowances, and other educational support to students from Batangas, Manila, Bulacan, and Taguig on September 12, Friday, at the Acacia Hotel Manila in Muntinlupa. Additionally, this year’s theme “Green Generation,” highlights its strong belief that every person’s potential matters and that education is the key foundation for building a stronger nation.\n“We believe in the value of the individuals. That’s why we believe building human capital is the most important, which we achieve through education and upskilling people. That is what we keep doing for so many years,” said SCG Country Director Mr. Jirasak Kaewubol\n.\nThe program aligns with SCG’s commitment to improving the quality of life for all communities where it operates. Beyond the “Sharing the Dream” program, SCG is dedicated to a range of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives to improve the livelihoods of Filipinos through economic, social, and environmental development.\nCaption: (From left) SCG Country Director Mr. Jirasak Kaewubol, Her Excellency Makawadee Sumitmor, Thai Ambassador to the Philippines, and DepEd Director, Atty.Amorsolo R. Camara Jr. **.\nFor 17 years, the “Sharing the Dream” initiative has been a direct result of this dedication, and it has already seen remarkable success.\n“Through this partnership, we see through the high school students that it was not only the material things that were brought in, but actually the confidence that empowers them. That actually changes not only their lives but the lives of their families and the communities as well,” said DepEd Director, Atty. Camara Jr.\nThe program has a significant footprint in the Philippines, having awarded more than 4,000 scholarships since its inception in 2008. In the latest round of scholarships, high school students will receive an educational assistance package of P12,000 each, which includes a transportation allowance, school supplies, and school shoes. Additionally, 40 college scholars will be awarded P20,000 annually to support their educational journeys. These scholarships are a testament to SCG’s enduring belief in the power of education as a driving force for societal change.\nAspiring high school scholars are selected through a rigorous process designed to identify not only academic excellence but also strong character. To be considered, students must maintain a grade of 85 or higher with no grade below 80 and must also be active participants in non-academic organizations and extracurricular activities.\nThe application process itself is comprehensive, requiring a fully completed application form, and the SCG team carefully handpicks the deserving scholars who will receive the life-changing support from the company.\n“It’s important for you to be true to yourself for them to see the genuineness of your heart,” advises Ma. Jesiery Rose F. Guevarra, an SCG alumnus who received scholarships from SCG for high school and college, making it possible to achieve her dream as a nurse. She added that eagerness is an important value to have for SCG to truly see an applicant’s intentions and promise.\nCaption: SCG alumni Ma. Jesiery Rose F. Guevarra (left) and Ma. Theressa F. Orbeta experienced firsthand how the SCG Sharing the Dream initiative changed their lives for the better.\n“It’s important to try and try until you succeed. If it’s for you, there will come a time for it,” said Ma. Theressa F. Orbeta, another SCG alumnus who is now giving back to the company by working for them. She also mentioned that she initially experienced rejection during the selection process, but her determination highlighted her potential as an individual and as a professional, giving way to the opportunity of being an SCG scholar.\nSCG’s decision to focus its scholarship awards in Batangas, Bulacan, Taguig, and Manila is a deliberate one, driven by the organization’s strong ties to these communities.\nBeyond empowering students and changing their lives for the better, the partnership between Thailand and the Philippines in the “Sharing the Dream” initiative has fostered solidarity between the two countries.\n“The Royal Thai Embassy really appreciates the initiative of SCG. SCG also plays a part in promoting people-to-people connections, which I think is very important and is a strong foundation for every policy that the government would like to move forward with,” said Her Excellency Makawadee Sumitmor, the Thai Ambassador to the Philippines.\nAfter 17 years, the “Sharing the Dream” program has already impacted the lives of thousands of students and their families, creating a ripple effect of positive change. By investing in the next generation of Filipino leaders, SCG is building a stronger, more resilient community and helping to create a brighter future for the entire nation.",
