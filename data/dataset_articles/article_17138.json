  "text": "Exceptional Adult Learners Honoured At Wintec Awards Ceremony\nWintec proudly celebrated the achievements of its most outstanding adult learners at the institute’s annual Adult Learner Awards, held at its City Campus as part of Adult Learners’ Week – He Tangata Mātauranga, running from 8–14 September.\nThe Adult Learner Awards recognise ākonga (students) aged 25 and over who have demonstrated exceptional commitment to their studies while balancing the responsibilities of adult life. Whether retraining, returning to education after a long break, or studying while supporting whānau and communities, these learners embody the spirit of lifelong learning.\n2025 Award winners\nThe 2025 award winners came from a wide range of disciplines, and were studying from foundation right though to Master’s level:\n- Cameron Jones (Bachelor of Engineering Technology (Mechanical)) – Adult Learner Award\n- Chelsea Gotty (Bachelor of Music and Performing Arts) – Adult Learner Award\n- Leonie Hemopo (Te Ara Pūtake, New Zealand Certificate in Study and Employment Pathways) – Foundation Adult Learner Award\n- Gabrielle Rawhiti (Bachelor of Accounting) – Māori and Pacific Adult Learner Award\n- Taylor Erueti-Thompson (Bachelor of Design – Spatial Design) – Māori and Pacific Adult Learner Award\n- Devina Pai (Master’s in Applied Information Technology) – International Adult Learner Award\nEach winner was selected from a pool of 25 finalists across diverse fields of study. They were recognised not only for their academic achievements, but also for their enthusiasm, resilience and support of fellow learners. Each recipient received a $1,000 award in recognition of their accomplishments.\nThe ceremony was opened in mihi karakia by Wintec Kaumātua Tame Pokaia.\nJo Thomas, Group Director, highlighted the significance of adult learners in the institution’s community.\n“This year, 53 per cent of our ākonga here at Wintec are adult learners, many of whom juggle study with work, caregiving and other life commitments. These awards are a celebration of their courage, determination, and the joy they bring to learning. Their stories inspire us all.”\nToni Smith, 2019 Māori Adult Learner Award winner, who graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Information Technology from Wintec in 2020, was the guest speaker.\nToni works at Gallagher, currently in the role of Information Services Planning Manager. However, it was her internship with Gallagher, as part of her Wintec programme, that opened the door to a permanent role to her.\nToni, along with three tight friends, had completed a Diploma of IT at another institution. Their tutor at the time recommended they consider joining the Wintec Bachelor of Applied Information Technology programme and made an introduction to Wintec tutor Blaine Rakena. That introduction sealed the deal, with ‘Uncle Blaine’ going on to become the group’s rock, not just as a tutor, but for support, addressing concerns and giving pep talks, and the friends eventually becoming known as ‘The Whānau’.\nIn their three years on the programme The Whānau did everything together – they attended the same classes, studied and even commuted together. They also had some impressive achievements along the way, both individually - with Toni winning an Adult Learner Award and another of them winning a scholarship to study in China for a semester – as well as collectively. Together they created a platform game about Maui navigating te ao Māori (the Māori world) alongside the Māori gods, as well as creating a Waiata App for Wintec, that is still used by Wintec Kaimahi to this day, reinforcing the transformative power of education at any stage of life.\nAbout the Adult Learner Awards\nThe Adult Learner Awards are part of the Festival of Adult Learning – Ahurei Ākonga, a UNESCO initiative supported by the Tertiary Education Commission, adult and community education providers, and the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO. The festival also incorporates International Literacy Day, which is held each year on 8 September. The theme for International Literacy Day this year is Promoting Literacy in the Digital Era.\nTo be nominated, learners must be over 25 years old, enrolled in a full or part-time programme at Wintec, and demonstrate enthusiasm, determination, and a commitment to supporting others in their learning journey.\nAbout Wintec:\nWintec (Waikato Institute of Technology) is an institute of technology based in New Zealand's Waikato region. Wintec offers a wide range of degrees, diplomas and certificates. With a focus on practical, hands-on learning, Wintec is dedicated to equipping students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their chosen careers.\nWintec is currently part of Te Pūkenga – New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology, located in region 2 of the national network.",
