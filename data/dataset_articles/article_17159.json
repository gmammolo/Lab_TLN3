  "text": "Rising Star: ‘There are no limits’ for Andover’s Clara Conard\nANDOVER, Kan. (Catch it Kansas) - Clara Conard learned at a young age that some tasks could be more difficult for her.\nBut in her eyes, it just meant finding another way.\n“They knew it would be harder for me, but to just keep trying anyway because they knew I’d eventually get it,” she said.\nClara was born in China with a congenital limb deficiency, leaving her without her left arm below the elbow. She was adopted shortly after by Gayly and Shawn Conard, who had already completed two adoptions from China after determining it to be one of their life’s missions. And she began a new life in the southwest Kansas town of Minneola in 2011.\nClara is one of six children, four of whom were adopted from China.\nAnd with older siblings, Clara had to find her own ways to fit in and play along. Many of those days were spent at gymnastics.\n“She learned how to use her little arm to hook around the bar and do all sorts of things that we all thought were impossible,” Gayly said.\nClara didn’t just compete in gymnastics; she did so at an award-winning level. She proved to herself that she could do all sorts of other things, from swimming to paddleboarding, rock climbing, and even the violin, with the help of a prosthetic.\n“Violin - that was fun,” Clara said. “I liked to be able to use something like that and still play even though I was different than everyone else.”\nProsthetics ultimately proved not to function best for Clara, leaving her forced to complete tasks, such as driving and cooking, with her “little arm.”\nThe Conards moved to Andover three years ago. Then in middle school, Clara found a passion that didn’t require the use of two arms: running.\n“I mean, missing an arm makes it a little harder to do sports, but running - it’s just your legs,” Clara said with a smile.\nAfter completing a summer training program before her freshman year, Clara decided to give cross-country and track a try. She ultimately helped Andover’s girls’ team win the league meet, finishing ninth as an individual.\n“I really envision her as someone who can be competing for an all-state spot by her senior year,” Andover head coach Jonathan Jeffcoat said. “You see what she’s dealing with physically and think, ‘OK, I’m gonna have to modify stuff for her.’ It didn’t matter what exercise we asked her to do, she found a way to do it, and did it.”\nClara is fueled by the support of her family and the encouragement of her teammates, noting her love for competing with friends and teammates, and a hope to continue running after high school.\nShe hasn’t been slowed down yet, and has no plans to stop now.\n“They just really encourage me to like always keep trying things, even if I mess up the first time,” said Clara. “Sometimes just comparing myself to others and how they can do it so much easier than I can, and I’d find out different ways to figure it out.”\nAs long as their daughter tries, Gayly and Shawn said they will help her accomplish anything she wants.\n“You can decide what you wanna do, and if you want to do it, there’s a way if you’re willing,” Gayly said. “We have never considered her to be limited. We really set it as, there are no limits.”\nCopyright 2025 Catch it Kansas. All rights reserved.",
