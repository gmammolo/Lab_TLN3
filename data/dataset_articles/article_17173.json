  "text": "QUINCY — The Quincy Public Schools Foundation kicked off its annual fundraising effort while celebrating the community’s ongoing support for education.\nQPS alums Heidi Holzgrafe ‘00 and Eric Loos ‘01 chair the campaign.\nHolzgrafe stressed the campaign’s important role in supporting the school district.\n“I want donors to understand their dollars are imperative to providing an experience for the students and the teachers that really elevates the opportunities” available, she said. “It really makes a difference in ways that we don’t always see as donors.”\nThe Dream Big Annual Campaign launched without a specific fundraising goal.\n“We can always do more for our students, so we felt limiting our campaign goal was unnecessary,” QPS Foundation Executive Director Heidi Lanier said.\n“We want to encourage anyone to get involved at the level they feel appropriate and know these dollars are going to make a huge impact on our students and our whole community.”\nThe campaign, which runs through Jan. 30, encourages faculty and staff to ‘dream big” tied to potential ways to improve and enhance learning and help students realize their potential while in school and beyond graduation.\nThe 13th annual Night to Dream Big Gala will take place Friday, Nov. 7, with dinner, awards, live and silent auctions and musical entertainment.\nThe Dream Big Award, announced Wednesday night, recognizes four former Quincy High School fine arts faculty – Dan Sherman, Tom Burnett, Les Fonza and Clyde Bassett.\nThe Distinguished Alumni Award will be presented to international opera star Michele Crider ‘78, professor of vocal performance at Mozarteum University in Salzburg, Austria.\n“We are celebrating fine arts with this year’s event,” Lanier said. “So many alumni attribute their success or clarity in life back to A Building. The program has made a huge impact on current students and alumni.”\nA third award will be presented to the QPS staff member or educator nominated by their peers and selected by the community.\nTickets for a Night to Dream Big are $90 per individual and $650 per table of eight with early-bird pricing that ends Oct. 10. After that, individual ticket prices increase to $95.\nTickets are available online at qpsfoundation.org/ntdb and by calling 217-228-7112.\nAlso Wednesday, the foundation celebrated three new circles of Investment and recognized two others for advancing.\nCircles honored include the Richard “Tally” McDonald Memorial Fund for Music and Performing Arts, the QHS Show Choir Circle in honor of Ben Dombroski and the Fischer Family Fund for Specialized Student Enrichment.\nThe Dooley-Sherman-Fonza-Bassett Circle and the Bill and Margaret Keller Circle for Marching Band were recognized for surpassing the $25,000 level.\nIn the past fiscal year, the foundation provided nearly $500,000 through grants to meet teacher and district requests for technology, curriculum, training and other program needs. Funding sources include previous Dream Big campaigns, endowment dividends, grants and private gifts.\nSupporting all the district’s students not only makes a difference in their lives but in the community.\n“We as a community need to develop and invest in our young people that are going to stay here – and show them what it means to participate, to actively engage and how they can be a very vital part of our town,” Holzgrafe said.\n“Exploring and finding out your path is part of what the foundation helps support in providing experiences the district otherwise couldn’t offer.”",
