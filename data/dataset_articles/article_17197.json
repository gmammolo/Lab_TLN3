  "text": "GRAND BLANC — One summer day in 2024, while pulling weeds in the Center Pointe Garden, Mary Madden was inspired to add a focal point, a sculpture to be placed among the blooms.\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 9, city officials, representatives of the Community Foundation of Grand Blanc and members of the Touch the Earth Garden Club gathered at Center Road and Saginaw Street to dedicate the sculpture, entitled Butterfly Dreams.\n“Butterfly Dreams is the perfect addition to Center Pointe Garden,” said Madden, vice president of Touch the Earth, the volunteer organization that plants and maintains many of the gardens throughout the city.\nCity Manager Wendy Jean-Buhrer thanked Touch the Earth and the Community Foundation for making the garden, and the beauty within it, possible.\n“The city appreciates everything you do and every idea you bring to us,” Jean-Buhrer said. “This (sculpture) is an amazing amenity and addition to this garden.”\nThe bronze sculpture, like many in the city, was created by Jordan Rose of the Randolph Rose Collection.\nIt depicts a butterfly landing on the outstretched hand of little girl, and stands 45 inches tall.\nCenter Pointe Garden has had several upgrades this year, including the addition of new planters, trellises, decorative barrels, and a state-of-the-art aqua-stick irrigation system to ensure the garden remains vibrant and healthy.\nThe improvements were funded through grants from the Community Fund of Grand Blanc and the Creasey Family Parks Fund of the Community Foundation of Greater Flint.",
