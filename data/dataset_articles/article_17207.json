  "text": "No fewer than 61 inmates at the Kirikiri Medium Custodial Centre, Lagos State, have graduated from the nine-month Onesimus Project skills acquisition programme organised by the Prison Fellowship of Nigeria in collaboration with Covenant University and the European Union.\nThe graduation ceremony, which was the 14th edition of the programme, took place at the custodial centre’s chapel on Wednesday.\nSpeaking at the event, the Executive Director of Prison Fellowship of Nigeria, Jacob Tsado, noted that the programme, which began as a rehabilitation initiative, had grown into a “movement that restores dignity, builds capacity, and equips inmates and ex-inmates with the confidence to begin anew.”\nTsado revealed that as part of the expansion plans for the programme, the PFN had concluded arrangements to establish a training centre in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, to further rehabilitate and train inmates.\nHe said, “This centre will serve as a hub for rehabilitation and follow-up services, skills acquisition, volunteer training, restorative justice programming, and youth engagement.\n“We see this as a crucial next step in consolidating the gains of the Onesimus Project and preventing offending and reoffending.”\nWhile commending their partners, the ED urged the graduating students to sustain the discipline and character they had displayed during the training once they regained their freedom.\nIn his address, the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, who also serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the PFN, Olayide Adelami, said initiatives such as this would provide hope for inmates and reduce their likelihood of reoffending upon release.\nAdelami, who was represented by the Vice-Chairman of the PFN Board of Trustees, Prof Chioma Agomo, called for collaboration among government agencies and civil society organisations towards transforming correctional facilities across the country.\nAgomo said, “The success of initiatives such as this depends on strong collaboration among government, civil society, the private sector, and development partners.\n“Together, we can transform our custodial centres into true correctional facilities that restore lives, reduce crime, and contribute to national development.\n“To our graduating students, I extend my heartfelt congratulations. Your courage to embrace change and your resilience in pursuing a new path stand as a beacon of hope for others.”\nIn her remarks, a Senior State Counsel at the Department of Public Prosecutions, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Suliat Ojikutu, stressed that beyond ensuring justice was served, the DPP was equally committed to ensuring that inmates became better versions of themselves.\nOjikutu urged the graduates to view the rehabilitation programme as a call to desist from crime.\nDelivering a lecture, a lecturer in the Department of Psychology at Covenant University, Dr Dayo Odukoya, encouraged the inmates to master the art of emotional intelligence and emotional regulation.\nThe highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of certificates, working tools, and cash prizes to outstanding graduates, alongside an exhibition of items produced by the inmates.\nIn his remarks, the Comptroller of the NCoS, Lagos Command, Daramola George, thanked the PFN and its partners for the programme which he said aligned with the core values of the agency.\nHe urged the graduating inmates to see the opportunity as a recognition of their resilience, hard work and commitment, which he said would make them better people outside of the facility.",
