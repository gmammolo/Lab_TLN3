  "text": "DETROIT – In the heart of Midtown, Wayne State University stands as an institution that molds not only scholars but also champions. Ahmed Elsayed embodies this duality, a former Wayne State fencing student-athlete whose journey intertwines the precision of Olympic fencing with the rigor of mechanical engineering.\nDuring the April 25 Wayne State University Board of Governors meeting at the Hilberry Gateway, the spotlight turned to a story that captures the heart of the university’s mission: expanding prosperity through opportunity, access, and achievement.\nThat story belonged to Elsayed.\nBorn and raised in Egypt, Elsayed’s path to Detroit began with a fencing sabre. After winning the 2018 African Championships, he attracted global attention, including from Wayne State’s storied fencing program.\n“Everyone in the fencing world knows about Wayne State,” Elsayed told the board. “The decision was easy.”\nIt’s one thing to move across the world for college. It’s another to become a campus leader, All-American athlete, and graduate student while mentoring others along the way. In Elsayed’s story, Wayne State’s Prosperity Agenda – its commitment to student success, upward mobility, and community impact – is more than an initiative. It’s personal.\nElsayed made an immediate impact as a Warrior, competing in three NCAA championships and earning First Team All-American honors as a freshman. He set a new school record for men’s fencing victories with 290 wins and served as team captain. Today, he’s an assistant coach and was named Assistant Coach of the Year by the Central Collegiate Fencing Conference.\n“Wayne State gave me more than just a place to compete,” he said. “It gave me a place to grow.”\nThat growth wasn’t limited to athletics. Elsayed earned his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering in 2023 and received his master’s in propulsion and energy systems this spring. He plans to keep giving back to the sport that shaped him, and to the institution that made his journey possible.\n“This university allowed me to turn potential into purpose,” he said. “That’s what Wayne State does – it sees your future, not just your present.”\nThe Prosperity Agenda aims to make stories like Elsayed’s the rule, not the exception. By offering accessible, high-quality education in the heart of Detroit, Wayne State equips students with the tools and support to thrive.\nElsayed is a clear example of that mission in motion.\nWayne State alumnus and doctoral candidate Randolph Hull, who serves as the Student Alternate Representative on the Board, was moved by Elsayed’s story.\n“As someone who played football here, I’m so proud of you,” Hull said. “Student-athletes become student alumni. Your leadership and your passion – that’s what we’re all about.”\nElsayed’s ambitions extend beyond the fencing strip. He sees coaching as a way to continue Wayne State’s legacy of excellence and inclusion.\n“I want to mentor the next generation the same way this university mentored me,” he said.\nAnd while he’s passionate about coaching, his engineering education isn’t just a backup plan – it’s part of a well-rounded future. Whether he’s advancing clean energy systems or shaping championship athletes, Elsayed’s impact is built on the foundation Wayne State provided.",
