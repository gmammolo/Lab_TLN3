  "text": "Commissioner of Education Robbie Fletcher and Commissioner of Agriculture Johnathan Shell did a whirlwind tour of local schools Tuesday as part of the statewide All in for Ag week. The pair, along with Kentucky FFA Advisor Kristan Wright and other members of their team, visited Providence Elementary School in Webster County, and both Madisonville-North Hopkins High and Pride Elementary in Hopkins County.\n“All in for Ag week is about educating specifically our elementary school kids about what agriculture is,” said Shell. “By the time they get into high school they’ve already got their interest established and are looking at other things. We want to give them a big exposure in elementary school about where their food comes from.”",
