  "text": "UNIVERSITY PARK — Prospective pesticide applicators can gain a foundation of knowledge about safe and effective handling of pesticides by attending the “Pesticide Applicator Short Course: Learning Together Live,” a Penn State Extension workshop and classroom-based course.\nEach session combines recorded presentations with guidance from an in-person instructor aimed at helping participants prepare for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture’s pesticide applicator certification exam.\nThe workshop will take place on several dates in various locations. Organizers noted that exam preparation options may vary by location and ask that participants check the local event for specific details:\nMill Hall: 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sept. 22-25, at the Clinton County Resource and Education Center, 47 Cooperation Lane.

Exam preparation offered in core.\nThe course is intended for commercial, public and private applicators.\nCommercial applicators apply pesticides to customers’ properties. Public applicators are funded by public money and may work for the state, a municipality, a public school district or other such entities. Private applicators include those who intend to purchase and apply restricted-use pesticides to the property they or their employer own or rent to produce an agricultural commodity, including nurseries and greenhouses.\nEach session features recorded presentations complemented by an in-person instructor who will answer questions, facilitate discussion and help participants build confidence in understanding the material. Meals will not be provided; organizers encourage participants to bring their own food or explore local dining options during breaks.\nExam preparation may be offered in the core category, which involves training and testing on pesticide safety and regulations and is required for every certified applicator; in category 7, which is required for applicators using pesticides in lawn and turf areas and ornamental and shade trees; and in category 23, which is required for applicators using pesticides in a campground or recreational area of a public or private park, or on elementary or secondary school property. Registrants can find specific details by viewing the event site.\nRegistration fees start at $60. More information is available on the Penn State Extension website.\nOrganizers pointed out that the registration fee does not include study materials. All participants are responsible for obtaining their own core and category certification examination training materials for the class.\nInstructors recommend ordering training packets in advance on the Penn State Extension website or by calling the Penn State Publications Distribution Center toll-free at 877-345-0691. To ensure on-time arrival for the course, participants should place orders before 3 p.m. and allow four business days to receive the study materials. Certification exam study manuals are nonreturnable.\nIf participants plan to use study packets that were purchased previously, they should make sure their study materials include the updated manuals.\nMore information on Pennsylvania certified applicator categories is available in English at “Which Pesticide License Does Your Business Need?” and in Spanish at “¿Qué licencia de pesticida necesita su empresa?”\nThe pesticide applicator licensing exam will not be offered as part of this course.
