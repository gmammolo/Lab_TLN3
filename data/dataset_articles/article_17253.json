  "text": "For thousands of students now back at school, this is the year when they start preparing to make important, life-changing choices as they apply to university or college.\nAnd this year students applying for study in 2026 are doing so using the new question-based Ucas personal statement , which asks:\nWhy they want to study the course or subject. About their preparedness for study. And other relevant experience they have outside of school. Ucas has an important role in breaking down barriers for young people who want to go to university or college, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nIn my time as a school leader and parent, I saw how the free-text personal statement often felt more like a hurdle than a gateway to higher education.\nEncouragingly, fresh survey findings from Teacher Tapp show that nearly two-thirds of teachers (65 per cent) in England think the new format has improved how students apply to university or college - with just 8 per cent disagreeing.\nUcas’ new personal statement What’s more, at their core the new questions are designed to ensure that students from all backgrounds better understand the key information that universities and colleges want to know about them when making admissions decisions.\nI’m really pleased to see that the changes have been particularly welcomed in schools with the most disadvantaged intake (free school meals quintile 4), where 73 per cent of teachers said it has improved the application process for students, compared with 61 per cent in the most advantaged schools (FSM quintile 1).\nThe changes were made after Ucas spoke to thousands of teachers, students and university admissions experts. It’s clear that for most students, answering the personal statement is a formative moment.\nFor many it’s the first time they’ve written about themselves in this way and they have to think deeply about what they are applying to study and why.\nThis was a key element of the change, as when developing the questions, Ucas’ research suggested that the new approach helps students to think about whether they really do or don’t want to study a particular course or subject.\nTeachers responding to the Teacher Tapp survey said the new format has improved the application process for students in four main ways:\nA clearer focus for students: the new format guides students to include relevant, subject-specific content, helping them to overcome writers’ block and avoid generic statements. Less stress and workload: shorter, structured questions make the process more manageable for students and reduce redrafting time for both students and staff. Fairer and more accessible: the changes support equity by shifting the emphasis from writing skills to personal relevance, benefiting students with less support or those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Better use for universities: structured questions make it easier for admissions tutors to compare applicants.\nSo far it seems the new approach is proving positive for both teachers and students. Ucas will continue working with teachers to make sure they have the tools they need to support students applying to university or college.\nI firmly believe that all who can benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so.\nThe new personal statement is one way that Ucas is keeping the doors of opportunity open, so that every student can take their next step with confidence.\nDr Jo Saxton CBE is chief executive of Ucas\nYou can now get the UK’s most-trusted source of education news in a mobile app. Get Tes magazine on iOS and on Android\nWant to keep reading for free?
