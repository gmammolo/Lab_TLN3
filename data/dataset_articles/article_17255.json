  "text": "Many classroom teachers wonder about the step up to leadership: “Do I have what it takes?” “Is it for me?” “Do I want to leave the classroom?”\nSo when a post became available in our school for a year’s sabbatical cover as assistant principal and Primary Years Progamme (PYP) coordinator, I saw an opportunity to find out the answer to these questions - safe in the knowledge that the job wouldn’t be forever.\nI was still nervous about applying - I knew I had the skills and experience, not to mention the determination and grit, but I found it challenging to consider putting myself forward.\nTaking the leap into leadership However, I took a leap of faith and went for it. I expected a quick “Thanks but no thanks”. But I was invited to interview and a few days later I discovered that I had been successful. I was over the moon to accept the role.\nThen the reality hit that I was going to be part of the leadership team. It was only for a year…but suddenly that sounded like a long time.\nI took a deep breath and told myself I could do this: I know the school, I know the people, I know our pupils.\nEven so, the first meeting I led with my colleagues during preparation week about the unit of inquiry was a nerve-wracking one. Suddenly I was in charge and they were looking to me for leadership.\nHowever, I drew on my experience as an early years teacher to get messy and creative: I gave each teacher a wooden block of their initial and asked them to decorate it to express who they are.\nWe then displayed these for the pupils and it was great to see them looking at them, comparing them, noticing special things about their teachers.\nWhile this was fun, it also helped to put me at ease and the staff, too. Then we could get on with the work at hand. It may sound like a little thing, but getting through that first meeting meant overcoming a big first hurdle and it gave me the confidence to keep going.\nIndeed, throughout the year there were many hurdles - regularly scheduled meetings, the organised chaos of the PYP exhibition, supporting the different needs of staff members and being consistently present and visible for pupils, staff and parents.\nFinding my rhythm But I soon found my rhythm. From providing the right snacks during meetings, to checking on staff members after an absence to covering a host of different lessons, I soon began to realise who needed what and when, and so incorporated it into my schedule.\nBeing in a position to help when needed made me feel useful in a different way. I was able to connect and work with the leadership team and hopefully help our school develop and grow.\nMany of the concerns that I’d had about leadership dissipated and I realised I could still bring a lot of me to the role.\nIn fact, while a year had at one point felt like a long time, by the end it felt like it went by incredibly quickly. I started to think that I hadn’t done enough, I should have pushed myself further, I should have solved that problem, I should have been better…\nBut then I reminded myself that my job was to be the caretaker for the role. And in that regard I felt I had done what was asked of me and I was proud of that.\nWhat I’ll miss Now, as I transition back into the classroom, I look forward to the daily excitement and challenges that the role brings.\nBut I know I will also miss the daily connection with the whole school, such as high-fiving the grade 5 student, consoling the grade 3 student and sharing a joke with the grade 2 teachers that my time in leadership provided.\nObviously, the question you’re thinking now, and I’m asking myself regularly, is would I do it again?\nHonestly there were days when I would have said definitely not! Yet with the benefit of time to reflect on a year of learning, change and challenge, I know I absolutely would.\nThat’s not something I may have known about myself without the opportunity for a short-term leadership role like this.\nOf course, it may not be an option that presents itself for everyone. But if you have wondered about leadership and a short-term leadership role becomes available, it can be an amazing opportunity to learn what you are capable of.\nBelieve in yourself and take the leap. I’m glad I did.\nKatie Paterson is a teacher leader and classroom teacher at Bonn International School in Germany\nFor essential weekly intelligence on the international schools sector, sign up for the Tes International newsletter\nWant to keep reading for free?
