  "text": "Sponsored Content\nChloe Polston started building her future while in high school. Chloe successfully completed the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and phlebotomy programs through UACCB’s concurrent credit partnerships with area high schools. Those free, career-focused classes gave Chloe a head start, and today she’s continuing her journey in UACCB’s Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) program.\nNow in her first semester, Chloe says the support she’s received from faculty has already stood out. “They really want to make sure that you ace the program; they really want you to succeed,” she shared.\nBelow, Chloe visits with White River Now’s Chad Whiteaker about her journey at the University of Arkansas Community College at Batesville. Take a listen:\nUACCB was recently named one of the Top 3 Nursing Programs in Arkansas and is known for providing hands-on instruction at an affordable tuition rate.\nUACCB’s Traditional RN program is now accepting applications until October 31, 2025.
