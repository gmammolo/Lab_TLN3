  "text": "Two employees with the Walker County Extension Office are reflecting on their time spent in area schools, as their time as SNAP-Ed educators will soon come to an end.\nWhen the One, Big, Beautiful Bill passed in July, funding for SNAP-Ed (also known as Live Well Alabama in our state) was eliminated in the package. SNAP-Ed is meant to provide education on healthier eating and living practices for those who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, food stamps). SNAP eligibility was also impacted as a result of the cuts.\nSNAP-Ed educators Ginger Eatman and Joshua Berryhill, who serve Walker and Marion County schools, are in their last month of service, as their positions will be cut, effective Sept. 30.\n\"I feel like we're just getting started,\" Eatman said in an emotional reflection. \"That's the weird thing about all this. Even though I've been with Extension for eight years, I truly feel like we're just getting started in what we were able to do, but change is inevitable. We don't always get to choose how that change comes down the pipe.\"\nEatman is working toward her master's degree in agriscience education, which she should earn by the end of the year, and is hoping to one day soon work as an educator again. Berryhill has been a SNAP-Ed educator for the past few years, and told the Eagle he may have an opportunity to stay employed with Marion County Extension.\n\"It's sad to see the program come to an end, because like Ginger said, I have seen it come full circle from when I was just a volunteer in the garden where my kids attended (school), and seeing the changes she was making in different communities,\" Berryhill said. \"And then being able to apply to this position, get the position and work with so many other schools and so many other kids.\"\nFamilies changed through SNAP-Ed\nIt's quite miraculous what Eatman and Berryhill — and SNAP-Ed educators across the state — have been able to accomplish in the nearly 30 years of the program to educate youth and families on healthier practices.\nLive Well Alabama's Body Quest program encouraged third graders in schools to make healthy eating choices — an initiative aimed at preventing childhood obesity. Eatman recalled leading Body Quest in some county schools pre-COVID and working more to implement the program's goals in 21st-century after-school programs post-COVID.\nEatman and Berryhill have helped many schools in Walker and Marion counties start community gardens — 16 in total, according to Eatman.\n\"I grew up with a garden, so I love gardening. Both my grandparents had gardens, my mom and dad had a garden. I grew up gardening, and I loved it,\" Eatman said. \"The first opportunity I had to do a school garden, I was excited and overjoyed, and I thought everybody should have a school garden.\"\nThere is no shortage of photos on social media from schools praising the SNAP-Ed educators for helping to start the gardens, and the students are always involved in the process — landscaping, planting, harvesting and maintaining their gardens. The community garden effort even earned Berryhill an affectionate name. He recalled seeing a student in a store one day whom he had met during one of his school visits.\n\"She was telling her grandmother, 'Me and him are best friends. He's Mr. Garden Man. He came and taught us how to garden,'\" Berryhill said.\nHe and Eatman also do general education on healthy eating, staying hydrated, etc., and have sometimes helped students prepare healthy meals. Berryhill said that's when children are exposed to foods they never would have tried otherwise.\n\"You hear it all the time, 'My kid is not going to eat that.' It's because they haven't even tried it,\" Berryhill said. \"There's no telling how many times I've been in Body Quest and brought vegetables, and I would say 80 to 90% of the class would sit there and tell me they've never tried it. More than half of those will end up trying it, and they'll ask the next week, 'Are you bringing those vegetables back?'\"\nThe education has continued out of the classroom as well, with the SNAP educators sending home healthy recipes and shopping lists for kids to get their parents involved in the process.\nAnother push with SNAP-Ed has been to increase physical activity.\n\"One of my goals with SNAP-Ed was for all five of our (Walker) county high schools to have bikes. We're getting very close,\" Eatman said.\nThrough the support of Cawaco Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D), Children's of Alabama, the Walker Area Community Foundation and the Walker County school system, many students in Walker County have learned to ride bicycles, and some schools have their own bike fleet. Eatman, representatives with the Foundation and the Alabama Power Service Organization, and others have helped teach the teenagers how to ride the bikes, ultimately increasing their physical activity.\nOutside of hands-on activities, the SNAP-Ed educators have helped write grants to benefit schools and educated teachers in an effort to sustain all they have started. Eatman said her greatest hope is that the schools will sustain what has been put in place for children and their families to adopt healthier practices.\n\"We test so much in this day and age that we've eliminated a lot of hands-on experiences, but if you can tie anything to a standard, it makes it easier for the teacher to put into their lesson plans,\" Eatman said. \"That's one of the things we hope schools do with gardens, bicycles, food demonstrations, grocery shopping field trips — we're hoping that schools put them in their lesson plans and tag them into their standards.\"\nBerryhill added, \"I think a lot of people don't realize, and they will realize once our program is gone, the actual impacts that we were making.\"\nA worthwhile mission\nEatman and Berryhill said they once wondered if they were making a difference — if the lessons and encouragement to be healthier were being retained — but they both recalled instances where they knew they had been in the right place at exactly the right time.\nEatman said her moment of impact came when a ninth-grader she educated at an area school reached out to her one day.\n\"She said, 'I knew when God placed you in my life in third grade, that He placed you there for a reason.' It's more than food,\" Eatman said tearfully. \"You don't realize how much of an impact you have on them until you see them later.\"\n\"I don't think the impact ever dawned on me that I was making,\" Berryhill said. That was until he saw a group of girls in a dugout one day, and they all held up their bottles of water to let him know they were working to stay hydrated, as he had instructed at their school. \"That finally came full circle. I'm actually making that impact. I can see it.\"\nAnd the schools will continue seeing the impact in the years to come as the community gardens are managed and new groups of children ride bicycles around their campuses. They may not understand how it all came to be, but the mark that SNAP-Ed left will be evident.\n\"Nobody ever thought the program would go away because of the impact it makes, and it has been around so long. Your hope is always that in the future, whether it be your state representatives finding the money to support the program or the federal government ... my hope is that it will come back in the future, because I believe we will see a negative impact out of it (going away),\" Berryhill said.\nWalker County Extension Agent Rebecca Persons, whose primary focus is 4-H education, said she does plan to step in and do a few garden activities with kids this school year.\n\"I might be doing more health and nutrition, from the garden-type activities this year,\" Persons said. \"I'm looking forward to doing some of the stuff I haven't got to do in a while.\"\nHowever, her primary focus will remain 4-H.\nShe said people need to understand that while Eatman and Berryhill's positions are being eliminated, Walker County Extension is not going away, nor is the 4-H program.\nStanding firm in faith\nEatman and Berryhill spoke of their faith and how they are clinging to it during this time of transition.\n\"It is very heart-wrenching for us to know what we do will no longer be available after Sept. 30,\" Berryhill said. \"I'm just leaving it in God's hands. He's always taken care of me, and He's always placed everything in His timing, just like this job.\"\nEatman said the SNAP-Ed program has \"truly been a blessing in this chapter of life.\"\n\"It would be very difficult to get through what we are currently going through if we did not have a strong faith in God,\" she said. \"I don't know what my future holds, but I know who holds my future. There's some peace about that.\"",
