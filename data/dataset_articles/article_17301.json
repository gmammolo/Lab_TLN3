  "text": "Rashtraniti, NEEEV among 3 new programmes in Delhi schools from today\nThe Delhi government will launch three new education initiatives, Rashtraniti, NEEEV, and The Science of Living, today. These programmes are part of Sewa Pakhwada, a two-week campaign promoting welfare and community activities to mark the Prime Minister's birthday.\nThe Delhi government will launch three major education initiatives—Rashtraniti, NEEEV, and The Science of Living—across its schools today at 1 pm at Bharat Mandapam, marking Day 2 of Sewa Pakhwada, a two-week campaign of welfare and community activities on the occasion of the Prime Minister’s birthday.\nRASHTRANITI: GIVING STUDENTS A VOICE IN SCHOOL GOVERNANCE\nThe flagship programme, Rashtraniti, aims to give students hands-on experience in decision-making and leadership. Schools will form at least seven student-led committees focusing on areas such as the environment, anti-bullying measures and canteen management.\nStudents will elect representatives through a school-level voting process, while teachers will act as mentors. Officials say the initiative is designed to help students build teamwork, governance and problem-solving skills.\nNEEEV: NURTURING YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS\nFor Classes 8 to 12, the government will introduce NEEEV (New Era of Entrepreneurial Ecosystem and Vision) to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. The programme will include:\n- Startup competitions\n- Guest speaker sessions\n- School and district-level innovation councils\nStudents will also have the chance to receive financial support of up to Rs 20,000 for promising projects.\nTHE SCIENCE OF LIVING: FOCUS ON WELL-BEING AND MINDFULNESS\nThe third initiative, The Science of Living, will bring mindfulness, yoga, meditation and lessons on cyber safety and digital detox into classrooms. Activities such as Yamuna clean-up drives, role-plays, and puppet theatre will provide students with practical exposure to social responsibility.\nIn addition to these education initiatives, Day 2 of Sewa Pakhwada will see a tree plantation drive with diplomats and the inauguration of 500 Anganwadi-cum-creches. Officials said these measures continue Delhi's effort to link learning with life skills and promote holistic student development.",
