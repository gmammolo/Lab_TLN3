The scholarship program is in its 23rd consecutive year, and Mediacom’s investment will award $1,000 World Class Scholarships to 60 high school seniors.\nStarting in the fall of 2026, scholarship recipients have the flexibility to use the financial awards to support post-secondary college costs or vocational training from an accredited institution. Award selection is based on academic achievement and leadership accomplishments.\nMediacom’s World Class Scholarship application is hosted online: mediacomworldclass.com. Applications, including letters of recommendation and high school transcripts, must be submitted online. Information has been sent to high schools in areas where Mediacom delivers its high-speed internet services. High school officials are asked to encourage seniors to submit online applications before the Jan. 5, 2026 deadline.\n“Our mission is rooted in connection – not only through broadband, but by helping young minds reach their full potential. Supporting students in their academic journey is not just an investment in their future but in the shared future of every community we serve,” said Tapan Dandnaik, Mediacom’s SVP of Operations, Product Strategy and Consumer Experience.\nWorld Cass Scholarship appli- cants do not have to be Mediacom customers, but must live in the 22-state area served by Mediacom’s fiber-rich broadband network.
