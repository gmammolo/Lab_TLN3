  "text": "LEXINGTON — In support of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s (KDA) All in for Agriculture Education Week programs, students from the University of Kentucky Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment created several lessons and activities to teach elementary students about agriculture. After a successful program run in March 2025, KDA is undertaking a second week of activities and promotion through this week.\nThe initiative, designed to grow agricultural literacy and connect classroom learning to real-world skills, invited students in the Agricultural Education and Advocacy degree program in the Department of Community and Leadership Development to develop dynamic and age-appropriate explorations of food systems, livestock and plant science.",
