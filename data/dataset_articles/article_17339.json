  "text": "“Mesmerizing.”\nThat’s how Newark Charter School senior Pranavi Kona described the school’s new STEM Innovation and Collaboration Center.\nKona is surely not the only student to have that reaction, and it’s easy to see why.\nThe STEM Innovation and Collaboration Center is a collection of four state-of-the-art labs for engineering, physics, integrated science, and computer engineering. The focal point is the engineering lab, which has a robotics arena and a floor-to-ceiling window that allows other students passing by in the hallway to see what’s going on inside the lab.\n“I think it’s really important that when you’re walking by this room, you can see what’s inside, because what’s inside is really cool,” senior Will Ross said. “I think that’s going to get more students interested and kind of realize a passion they have.”\nNewark Charter built the $450,000 innovation center over the summer, in part funded by donations and grants. It replaces several regular classrooms.\nHead of School Sam Golder said the school has seen increased demand from students for robotics and other science, technology, engineering and math courses. Up until now, however, those classes were taught in small classrooms that didn’t have enough room for certain experiments and activities.\n“Our engineering students are unbelievably talented. We needed the facility to match those talents,” Golder said. “And that’s really where we are now.”\nFeaturing movable furniture and flexible spaces, the new labs will foster innovation and collaboration, Chief Academic Officer Lisa Ueltzhoffer said.\n“Our students have demonstrated time and time again that they are capable of extraordinary things,” Ueltzhoffer said. “Their talent, creativity and drive are undeniable, and they deserve a space that matches their brilliance. A space that prepares them, not just for the jobs of today, but careers we can’t even imagine yet.”\nTami Lunsford, who leads Newark Charter’s science department, noted that she’s teaching students about information and fields of study that didn’t even exist when she started teaching.\n“Even in a fairly new high school, we have alumni graduating from majors and working in fields that we could not have predicted when we originally designed our curriculum and built the original classrooms,” Lunsford said. “This all means that we have to prepare these students to think, to problem solve and to innovate. We have always done our best, but now we have facilities that empower the students and the teachers to take it to the next level.”\nAfter years of planning, Lunsford enjoyed watching students experience the innovation center for the first time earlier this school year.\n“To watch them walk in and see this glass wall and be like, whoa, that’s our classroom now,” she said. “They just get re-excited about what it is that they’re doing. They absolutely love it.”\nThe new space also allowed Newark Charter to start an after-school robotics club, which had been a popular request from students. During a dedication ceremony for the labs Tuesday evening, engineering students were hard at work demonstrating how the robot they built can pick up and stack blocks.\nRoss said that after three years of taking engineering classes in a small, window-less classroom, the new space is a big improvement.\n“It lets you explore your imagination a little bit, be innovative and invent,” he said. “It’s really fascinating. I don’t know how many other schools or facilities have something like this.”\nSenior Haasini Devisetty said she was “in awe” when she saw the new labs for the first time.\n“It will make kids more interested to want to pursue a career in any STEM field, because of how exciting the new STEM Innovation Center is,” Devisetty said.\nKona added that the innovation center has also benefited her Technology Student Association club, which has seen growing membership.\n“The fact that we have much more space now to accommodate all of that interest in competitive engineering is so lovely,” she said.",
