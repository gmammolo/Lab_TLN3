  "text": "Decks have been cleared for 2.75 lakh students to cast ballot for the four-member Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) on Thursday (September 18, 2025). Voting will be conducted in two shifts: from 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. for day scholars and from 3 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. for students in the evening shift. Votes will be counted on Friday (September 19, 2025).\n“More than 600 police personnel have been deployed in North Campus,” said DCP (North) Raja Banthia. Of those deployed, 160 are equipped with body-mounted cameras. Additionally, surveillance will be maintained through the deployment of extra CCTVs and drones to ensure a peaceful voting process. “Every inch of the campus will be under police surveillance,” Mr. Banthia said. The DCP added that they will divert or block a few roads in the area to create a student-only pedestrian route to ensure smooth polling.\nABVP, NSUI clash at KMC College on final day of DUSU campaigning\nCampaigning for the DUSU polls this year remained largely muted on the ground, with candidates disseminating messages through Instagram reels, Facebook live sessions, and posts on X, in view of the university administration’s guidelines prohibiting canvassing via vehicles, using loudspeakers, and defacing public property. In 2024, the Delhi High Court withheld the counting of votes owing to reports of large-scale property defacement until the restoration work was concluded.\nNo victory parade On Wednesday (September 17, 2025), the court issued orders prohibiting victory celebrations following the counting of votes, scheduled for Friday (September 19, 2025).\nUse of money, muscle power in DUSU polls must end: Delhi HC A Bench of Chief Justice D.K. Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela directed Delhi Police, DU officials, and civil administration to take all possible steps to prevent violation of norms. Violations “may amount to contempt of court,” said the Bench. It added, “We direct that no victory procession shall be taken out by any candidate in campuses, hostels or in any area of the city.” A day earlier, the court had , while noting the use of high-end vehicles, JCBs and tractors during this year’s poll drives, remarked that the use of muscle and money in the polls must end.\nDUSU polls: 20 candidates to vie for four central panel posts\nMeanwhile, DU’s Chief Election Officer Raj Kishore Sharma said very few cases of defacements were reported this year. “There were one or two instances of violations reported to us. We are taking action in those cases.”\nIn 2024, the Central panel was split between the Congress-backed National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-linked Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), with the NSUI securing the president’s post after a gap of seven years.\nThis year, eight candidates are vying for the top post, including Aryan Maan of the ABVP, Joslyn Nandita Choudhary of the NSUI, and Anjali, backed by the All India Students’ Union and the Students’ Federation of India.\nPublished - September 18, 2025 10:37 am IST\nRead Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER SEE ALL Remove PRINT",
