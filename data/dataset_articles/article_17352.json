  "text": "By Gianna Cefalu Gabriel Stovall ,\n2 hours ago\nNORTH AUGUSTA, SC (WJBF)- This week’s scholar athlete is from North Augusta High School, who has mastered the art of multi-tasking.\nLuke Waldhauer is a senior Yellow Jacket that has a laundry list of student-athlete achievements. His sports include football, tennis, track and field and the clay target team. His academic honors? how about all-A honor roll, with a 5.17 GPA, honors seal of distinction recipient, future business leaders of America, National Honor Society and fellowship of Christian athlete’s student worship leader.\nAthletically, he’s been part of the Yellow Jackets football program all four years and is a founding member of the North Augusta pickle ball club, among so many other accolades. For Luke, time management is the key to his success.\n“It’s definitely a time crunch. The calendar can only help so much. Being in so many activities, organizing with the supervisors where I can be at certain times, that’s been a big struggle. And especially balancing with that with school,” Waldhauer said.\n“He’s really self-driven. Really proud of that fact. He mentioned earlier about keeping his calendar. His calendar stays full, and we’re pretty much just being the guardrails for him. He just keeps on going and does a lot of stuff on his own. And he’s got his own motor for sure,” said Luke’s father Karl Waldhauer.\n“Flexibility and organization. Because what he does, I couldn’t do. I get asked a lot of times over the weekend, ‘What’s Luke doing today?’ And I say I have no idea. He’s just always on the go,” said Luke’s mother Tara Waldhauer.\n“He’s the ultimate team guy. He’s willing to do whatever’s asked of him. Whatever it is to help a teammate. Whatever it is to help our team get better. He’s willing to do whatever, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re successful because we’ve got a lot of guys like him,” said North Augusta head coach Richard Bush.\n“Can’t get a punt off without a great snap. Same with a field goal. And he’s just Mr. Consistent. Always can count on him to do his job,” said assistant coach Dylan Quinn.\nLuke has narrowed his college choices down to either Clemson, Georgia, or Vanderbilt and will study biological sciences to prepare for Med school.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
