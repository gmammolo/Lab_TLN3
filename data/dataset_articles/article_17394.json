  "text": "Several years ago, the idea of note taking app can take notes for you that feel like pure science fiction to you.\nPossibly something that I dreamed about, whereas panic underlined my textbook at 2 AM.\nWhat if I told you that you can learn and study 10 times faster without getting burned out? Sounds like clickbait, right?\nNo, my friends, you can easily create as many notes with the help of ChatGPT or any Artificial intelligence tools.\nFurther, these days, that's how genius and good learners roll. Thanks to AI , you no longer have to write angrily for the duration of your lectures.\nOr you don't need to rewatch the same Zoom recording three times. You can easily create many notes with the help of AI and then turn them into organized notes.\nAll you need to do is simply present, and then focus on what's being taught. And you do not need to worry about the missing essential details.\nHow does effective note-taking software for students work?\nWe selected the recommendations based on the following factors, which we crammed into our knowledge and research:\nThese are as follows.\nMobile Access: Retrieving tools while on the go is made easier with iOS and Android apps. And being a student involves a lot of moving around.\nHALAMAN :",
