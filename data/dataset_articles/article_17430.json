  "text": "Parents who faced difficulties when the Harrisville daycare facility closed down earlier this year may have their prayers answered soon. Christina Kerns, owner of Chrissy’s Daycare in Pennsboro, is hoping to re-open the daycare at its former location on Main Street.\nWhile she is focusing a lot of effort to open in Harrisville, Kerns has no intention of shutting her doors in Pennsboro.\n“We have a lot of kids that we’ve had for many years; we could never do that to them,” she said. “But we have a lot of kids from the Harrisville area, Smithville area, its more convenient for them to be over here. We have kids that ride the bus from Harrisville to the daycare.”\nWhen the former daycare closed down, the building was emptied out, with Community Resources taking everything to their St. Marys office. Because of this, there are a lot of things the center still needs to get started properly. To help support this, the Harrisville center will be a non-profit under the name: Chrissy’s Little Explorers. “We changed it to non-profit so we could have more grants to support the children. That was my big goal, to keep this going successfully for the children,” Kerns explained. “It takes a lot for childcare, people don’t realize the insurance, the licensing, the supplies, and food it takes to support them, to have good quality care.”\nFor Kerns, ‘quality care’ means giving the children in her care a safe place to learn and grow. “For kids, it’s a home away from home. They eat breakfast and snacks, sometimes dinner with us. They’re at that point in their life where they’re absorbing everything,” she stated. “We’re always working with their education, with a curriculum. And they have so much energy, so we have them going outside, finding positive ways to burn their energy and express their emotions.”\nLike Chrissy’s Daycare, Little Explorers will include small fun and educational trips for the children. “We try to take them out to do activities, the library has been wonderful during the Summer. Each week we’ll go down for the library reading, they give us little activity bags for the kids. That has been such a big help.” They also have ‘Water Day’ during the Summer, where they take the kids to Doddridge County Park to swim.\nKerns explained that while there is no set opening date, the goal is to open by November 1. She isn’t on her own though, as the new center has already received donations in the form of time, effort, and supplies. Ira Haught is currently replacing the roof and adding insulation, Ace Hardware donated paint and supplies, and MOVTI is building cubbies and shelves. “Here lately, it’s been a really big community effort to get this up and running.”\nSpeaking of Haught, who owns the building, Kerns added, “He’s been really wonderful to work with – very patient – I had to come in and out with the Fire Marshall; the Fire Marshall has already been there and approved everything.” She continued, “We’re slowly knocking down obstacles.”\nWhile the intention is to apply for grant funding, the applications take time, so for now, donations are not only appreciated, but welcomed. Local attorney Judi McCullough donated money for cubbies, and most future monetary donations will go toward educational toys, furniture, and kitchen supplies, with any leftover expenses coming out of pocket.\n“We need proper prepping tables to make it a safe kitchen to prepare. We do home cooked meals, we do good quality meals. It’s very important for kids to have that nutrition,” Kerns explained. “We also have the nursery, we need cribs. We’re trying to get cots off the West Union Fire Department; they were selling theirs. They offered us a certain price for them, and we were hoping that money would go back into the fire department so we know the money is going to kind of stay in the community.” Additional needs include groceries to stock the pantry, craft items, and educational toys.\nKerns already has some employees lined up to work at the center, but is currently looking for a few more. There are a lot of requirements that come with the position, including the ability to pass a federal background check, and applicants must be 18 or older. New hires will also be fingerprinted and go through various training programs such as CPR and behavioral health. However, it is also important to her that those that apply want to be there for the kids. “I really want people that have a love for children – have patience,” she added. “Definitely patience and passion for children.”\nFor more information, or to inquire about making a donation, you can contact Chrissy’s Daycare at (304) 299-3039.",
