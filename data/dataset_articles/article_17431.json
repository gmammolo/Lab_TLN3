  "text": "ELEVEN Upper Hunter schools are set to benefit from $500 each, after students on Muswellbrook Youth Council lobbied Muswellbrook Shire councillors at an extraordinary meeting.\nStudents from Muswellbrook Public, Muswellbrook South Public, Denman Public, Sandy Hollow Public, Martindale Public, St James' Primary, St Joseph's Denman, Pacific Brook Christian School, St Joseph's Aberdeen, Scone Grammar School and Muswellbrook High lobbied the council on September 9.\nTheir wish list included new digital bells, school bike racks, shed upgrades, new sporting gear and classroom laptops.\nMuswellbrook Public School captains Stephanie Martin and Emma Carrison requested grant money to fund a new laptop for their school hall.\n\"A school hall is a busy place, it's where we come together for assemblies, award presentations, visiting speakers, scripture classes and performances,\" Stephanie said.\n\"A laptop is essential for all of these things, from running sound and slideshows to playing music and videos.\"\n\"Right now, the laptop we have is simply not working, causing regular issues during presentations and events,\" Emma said.\nStephanie said they had researched a few options for suitable laptops for their school, and the cost was between $800 and $1300.\n\"We're not asking for the full amount, we're asking for your help to get us started,\" she told councillors.\n\"If we receive the $500 grant, the student representative council will raise the rest through a fundraiser.\"\nCouncillors asked questions, assessed each pitch against community benefit criteria, and finally resolved to fund all 11 projects on the spot in a $5500 commitment.\nIt was a first look into how the Muswellbrook Youth Council will operate from 2026 as a forum for the town's young people.\n\"If these kids were nervous, we couldn't tell - they were organised, confident and thoughtful in their presentations to the elected council,\" mayor Jeff Drayton said.\n\"They identified needs within their schools, gave reasons and even handled a bit of scrutiny.\"\nHe said the meeting was a reminder that young people had plenty to offer.\n\"It's certainly not easy to speak in a formal setting. If these are our future community leaders and participants, Muswellbrook Shire is in good hands,\" he said.\nNext year, the youth council will be responsible for promoting youth wellbeing and leadership.\nStudents will have the opportunity to take part in full council meetings, be mentored by the mayor and staff and help plan community events under the Youth Council's 2026 budget.\n\"They'll learn how budgets work, give feedback on parks, footpaths, youth programs and even co-design events and facilities,\" Youth Council facilitator and council manager, governance and risk, Katie Hamm said.\nCouncil plans to rotate youth council meetings between Muswellbrook and Denman, livestream selected sessions to the public, and publish reports. Youth Council nominations will open in Term 1, 2026.",
