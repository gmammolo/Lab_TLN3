  "text": "'Outstanding' behaviour at Send school - Ofsted\nA Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) school on the Isle of Sheppey has been praised for offering a \"nurturing environment\" where pupils feel \"safe\".\nThe Elmley Dray School, which caters for young people aged 9-19 with autism and associated needs, has received a \"good\" rating from Ofsted following a June inspection.\nAn \"outstanding\" rating was given to the behaviour and attitudes seen at the independent school, whose proprietor and headteacher have changed since the last inspection.\nHeadteacher Emily Hollis MBE says this result is a \"huge achievement for everyone involved\".\nMs Hollis, who took up her position in September 2024, said: \"In just six months, we've created a school where students feel safe, valued, and inspired to learn.\n\"Our pupils' positive attitudes and exemplary behaviour are a real credit to them, and we're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished together.\"\nOfsted found that the school's \"new leadership at all levels is having a positive impact\", with inspectors citing an evolving curriculum and bespoke packages of learning as positive factors.\nInspectors described pupils' behaviour as a \"strength\".\n\"It is not perfect, but it is exceptional when the complexities of pupils' needs are considered,\" they found.\nThe quality of education, personal development, leadership and management were all given \"good\" ratings.\nInspectors were particularly impressed by the first two elements given that pupils currently attending have had a disrupted education prior to joining the school.\nWork to support pupils' ability to read was observed as a high priority, while the school also has a tailored programme to support pupils' personal development.\nIn terms of areas for improvement, inspectors found that curriculum is not clearly enough defined in some subjects and teachers do not always know what pupils need to learn.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.
