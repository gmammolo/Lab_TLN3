  "text": "The International Council on Archives’ New Professionals Programme (NPP) brings together emerging archivists and records managers from around the world, offering opportunities to connect, learn, and grow within the international professional community.\nThis year’s 2025 cohort is a diverse group of ten early-career professionals. Over the coming months, they will collaborate on projects, attend the ICA Congress in Barcelona, and be guided by experienced mentors. To begin these mentoring partnerships in an engaging and personal way, each New Professional was invited to introduce their mentor in their own words.\nThrough this exercise, the New Professionals explored their mentors’ careers, achievements, and the values that guide their work. It was a thoughtful way to start building connections while also offering a glimpse into the inspiring journeys of the mentors themselves.\nBelow, you can read these introductions, written by the New Professionals themselves.\nPatrick works as archives and information manager at the City Archives Zaventem (Belgium) whose work bridges traditional archival practices with community-based heritage work.\nInspired by both a history teacher and his aunt, who planted in him the passion for history and tracing family archives, Patrick pursued history at university and began rethinking the role of the archivist. Rejecting the image of the “closed, protected archive,” he advocates for archives as tools of social and cultural work, touching people through personal documents such as birth certificates or family photos.\nSince Patrick joined the City Archives of Zaventem, he has been seeking to challenge the narrow framing of the town as merely “the airport city,” instead highlighting its histories. For example, Patrick worked on projects linking cemeteries and archives where a new law required cities to inventory graves. He emphasized that archival research alone could not provide a full picture; community involvement was essential to uncover stories, family archives, and lived experiences tied to these sites.\nDuring the ICA Congress in 2000 in Seville, Verne Harris’s keynote was one of the opening minds moments for him on rigid description frameworks, and invitation to explore ways to integrate community-driven narratives into archival practice.\nFor the Heritage Day event that takes place in the city of Zaventem during the summer, Patrick collaborated with residents to collect old photographs, documents, and oral histories that trace a century of social change. He sees archives as a trigger for storytelling, where even small personal items–like a photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger performing in a local café in 1972–can bring community heritage to life.\nHinerangi brings a wealth of experience from the cultural heritage sector. Her experience working in the archive and cultural heritage sector for the past thirty years with a specific interest and attention to Māori matters draws on her lived experience. Originating from Te Tai Tokerau in the north of Aotearoa New Zealand, her iwi (tribe) is Ngāpuhi.\nHer journey into the heritage sector began in the 1990s when she worked sole-charge as a Māori Studies librarian and Māori Manuscripts Librarian at the Māori Studies Department, University of Auckland. Since then, she has freelanced as an independent contractor working mainly on Māori cultural heritage and creative design projects as project manager, researcher and facilitator. Her experience includes working with communities as well as senior executives within both iwi and government.\nHinerangi has extensive experience working with archives, museums and libraries, research projects and land claims. She has worked at Archives New Zealand and is a current board member of Te Papa Tongarewa Museum of New Zealand. Hinerangi is a founding member of the ICA Expert Group on Indigenous Matters (EGIM).
