  "text": "TANNER — Tanner Elementary School students showed off their newly renovated school to their parents Tuesday like a bride shows off her new ring.\nOver the summer, contractors completed a $2 million renovation of the elementary building that included new floors, newly painted walls, new lights and ceilings, and all new furniture. Compared to the old, it looks like a brand new school inside.\n“It’s a lot brighter, just more energetic, clean and modern,” said Angela Sides, mother of 7-year-old Wyatt Sides, a first grader who was exploring everything in a school room Tuesday night. “I graduated from here, and this is like a complete 180.”\nImpressed with the renovation, Principal Kandye Jones scheduled a tour of the school so parents could see what students had already seen when school began. She asked all the parents to check out all of the new cabinetry installed in all of the rooms.\n“We have beautiful cabinetry,” she said. What it replaced was far from beautiful.\nThe multimedia library is not only completely new, it is unique with all new floors, walls, ceilings and shelving and a modern art sculpture and light fixture in bright green.\nStarre Guffey, librarian/media specialist, knew she had one of the best remodeled rooms in the building and she was proud to show it off.\n“This is my first year here, and everything here is brand new from the floors to the ceilings to the tables to the chairs to the shelving.”\nShe said a library isn’t just about books anymore. \"You have the robotics and the coding and all of that 21st century learning that the kids love. The creativity. The collaboration. That’s the piece I love to see with the kids. So, they get to bring that and find a love of reading.”\nShe said the Tanner students deserve the renovations.\n“They just need someone in their corner to advocate for them,” she said.\n--\nSensory room\nOne of the changes at the school is the addition of a sensory room, which helps children who tend to get overstimulated come back down to earth. Kristal Markowitz, special education teacher, said the room has a lot of special equipment: a swing, all kinds of balls, a spinning circle, special steppingstones that change like lava lamps when you step on them, dimmable lights, a machine that makes soothing nature sounds like rain and thunder, some padded walls to bump against and other features to make it a place to let off steam and regroup.\n“They are proven to reduce aggression and reduce outbursts and reduce social awkwardness,” she said. “They are absolutely fabulous.”\nShe said a sensory room “is a wonderful tool for students with special needs like anxiety or ADHD.\n“It is a place for them to escape so they can regulate their emotions so they can get back and interact with the real world,” Markowitz said.\nThe children come in with their aide and there is a timer on the wall. Together they work to get the student back at peace over the next 20 minutes.\n“I love it,” said Shalonda Flores, mother of little Lana, a student at Tanner elementary who was also exploring the first grade classroom. “I went to Tanner. I graduated in 2010, so this is a huge upgrade.”\n“I feel like it is a lot more welcoming and clean,” said Sofia Wilburn, kindergarten teacher. “It’s easier now to make this space friendly for the kids. Last year, when I first got here, it was just kind of dirty and stuff and we were up here scrubbing walls. But I feel like now we can decorate and make it a calming environment for the kids.”\nShe picked out a lovely floral rug for the floor that featured bright flowers on a dark background, which she called her “splurge for the year.”\nRebecca Bicente, who was touring a classroom of the school with her four children, was pleased with it all.\n“I like the floors and the colors and I like how organized it is and I like everything,” she said.\nOne oddity in the building is the addition of a very large fish aquarium in one hallway, which is popular with the students. You could almost hear a teacher saying, “Please don’t tap on the glass.”\nThe only thing missing on the tour were the signs identifying the grade and teacher of each room. But those were being installed even as the tour progressed.\nThere are a lot more improvements coming to Tanner in the coming months, Jones said.\nTanner received a $403,000 grant for an after-school program that offers various activities for kids such as boys and girls ballet, drama and chess clubs, grit-and-grind basketball and some other activities to keep kids safe and entertained after school until their parents get home from work. The activities and after-school care is free, five days a week and with buses provided. Tanner averages 80-90 students after school, Jones said.\nTanner will soon install an entirely new playground for the kids, first removing all of the worn-out equipment. The change will mean a sort of cushioned rubber on the playground instead of mulch, which makes students and floors very dirty.\n“There will be a huge dome with all of this sensory-based equipment in it for play,” Jones said.\nLast year, Tanner Elementary was a state-targeted school in both mathematics and reading, Jones said. Under state-targeted status, the State Department of Education came in twice a month for reading and twice a month for math to monitor and inspire progress. With coaching and dedication, the teachers and students were able to get clear of the targeted status in math and they intend to get clear of the one in reading this year, Jones said.\n“I’ve worked in a lot of schools in 33 years. With that being said, this is the best,” Jones said while holding back tears during the pre-tour program. She lauded the students, the teachers, the small but mighty parent-teacher organization, the school bookkeeper and even the superintendent for all of the changes that have or will come to the school in the coming months and years.",
