  "text": "Jeong Seok-woo, CEO of the Korea Investor Forum, gathered accounting, legal, and practical experts to promote individual investors' rights and interests to discuss ways to establish a \"revised commercial law\" at the inaugural seminar in Yeouido on the 24th 사진 확대 Jeong Seok-woo, CEO of Korea Investor Forum (Professor of Korea University) [Photo = Korea Investor Forum] An expert forum was launched to make academic research, education, and policy suggestions to enhance the rights and interests of individual investors.\nThis is to further grow the capital market by improving the rights and interests of individual investors who were alienated from the Korean capital market and creating a reliable investment environment.\n\"In the meantime, there has been no channel to speak up for individual investors and speak out for their rights and interests. We need to increase transparency in capital markets and strengthen investor protection so that more money can be raised for promising companies.\"\nJeong Seok-woo, CEO of the Korea Investor Forum (Professor of Korea University, photo), recently stressed the need to strengthen the rights and interests of individual investors in an interview with the Maeil Business Newspaper.\nThe Korea Investor Forum, which is set to hold a seminar to commemorate its foundation on the 24th, started with the awareness that the interests of individual investors have not been reflected in the reform of the capital market-related system.\nThe rights and interests of individual investors who are in a weak position in the capital market and have weak cohesion have always been put on the back burner in improving the system.\nCEO Chung said, \"The authorities always put priority on protecting investors' interests just by looking at the accounting and audit systems, but in the end, reforms tended to take place around the interests of the company, which is the creator of financial statements, and the auditor, who is the reviewer,\" adding, \"The forum was launched as many scholars who have been conducting research services related to capital markets agree that efforts to improve the system are needed considering investors' positions.\"\nThe Korea Investor Forum, which reported the establishment of a corporation in January this year and began recruiting members, consists of about 50 accounting, legal and practical experts, including Korea University professor Yoo Seung-won (former chairman of the Korea Accounting Association), Sookmyung Women's University professor Park Jong-sung (former member of the Securities and Futures Commission), Yonsei University professor Ahn Kang-hyun, lawyer Song Chang-young (former member of the Securities and Futures Commission), and Ewha Womans University professor Kim In-bae.\nIt will also open its doors to people belonging to the institution to expand its membership to about 100.\nCEO Chung evaluated the implementation of policies to protect individual investors, such as the recent revision of the commercial law, as a trend of the times.\n\"The authorities, markets, and academia all agree that the rights and interests of individual investors need to be improved for the growth of the capital market,\" CEO Chung said. \"If there was enough protection for individual investors, this discussion would not have come out now.\"\nThe theme of the inaugural seminar to be held at the Financial Investment Education Center in Yeouido, Seoul, is \"Amendment of Commercial Law and Protection of Investors.\"\nThe revision of the commercial law, which changes the structure of the capital market, such as corporate governance, improvement, and reform of the treasury stock system, plans to find ways to specifically realize the tasks of the times of protecting investors' rights and interests.\nProfessor Oh Kwang-wook of Korea University and Professor Oh Myung-jeon of Sookmyung Women's University will present the \"task for the stable settlement of the revised commercial law\" under the theme of \"Revision of Commercial Law and Enhancement of Corporate Transparency.\"\nCEO Chung said, \"The recent revision of the commercial law is an important turning point in changing the framework of the capital market. (This seminar) will be an opportunity to consider how to realize the transparency, fairness, and investor protection required by our time in the system beyond just the dimension of institutional change.\"",
