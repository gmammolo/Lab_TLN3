  "text": "India Handpicked, co-authored by Shradha Sharma and Chhavi Mahajan, highlights the One District One Product initiative launched by Prime Minister Modi. The book delves into India's diverse craft traditions, emphasizing the economic and cultural significance of artisan communities in shaping the country's identity and exporting their rich heritage globally. Mumbai, India: Launched by Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, 'India Handpicked' explores the One District One Product (ODOP) initiative, co-authored by YourStory CEO Shradha Sharma and Chhavi Mahajan. The book underscores the immense cultural and economic contributions of India's artisan communities. Highlighting the transformative impact of ODOP, the book illustrates how it fosters market access and global recognition for traditional crafts. The initiative, a cornerstone of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, connects domestic artisans with international markets, bringing a renewed focus to crafts like Pochampally Ikkat and Khurja pottery. Throughout its narrative, India Handpicked showcases ODOP as both an economic driver and a cultural movement, with products used in state gifts symbolizing India's rich heritage. The initiative continues to boost local economies, promote cultural diplomacy, and ensure development reaches even the smallest communities. (With inputs from agencies.)",
