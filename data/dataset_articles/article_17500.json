  "text": "Deputy Ward emphasised that the recognition and leadership of SENCOs are essential\nDeputy Ward calls for SENCOs to be recognised as senior management in schools to ensure quality education for all children\nCharles Ward, TD for the 100% Redress Party, has stressed the need for Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs) to be formally recognised as senior management in Irish schools, with a pay grade equivalent to that of Deputy Principal.\nREAD NEXT: CSO reveals 10% annual rise in average Donegal property sale prices\nIn his speech which was delivered during a Dáil debate on school places, Deputy Ward emphasised that the recognition and leadership of SENCOs are essential if Ireland is to provide inclusive education and ensure appropriate school places for children with special educational needs (SEN).\nWhile recent efforts to increase the number of special classes in Irish schools are a step forward, the Donegal Deputy is clear that having a school place is not enough. He points out that special needs classes often remain ineffective if they lack the physical space or specialised facilities needed to meet the students’ individual needs. \"We cannot just create a place for a child with special needs and assume they’ll thrive,\" said Deputy Ward. \"The infrastructure has to be in place, but so does the leadership to manage that space.\"\nDrawing a clear parallel, he compared the situation to having a sports team without a coach: \"You may have the right players, but without a skilled leader, the team won’t reach its potential.\" The SENCO provides that crucial leadership, ensuring resources are effectively coordinated and educational strategies are implemented to support every child’s needs.\nCurrently, the role of SENCO is not embedded within the senior management structure of Irish schools. Deputy Ward argues that this must change to ensure children with special needs are supported and included in the education system.\n\"To provide the best education for children with special needs, we need more than just a space on the timetable,\" he stated. \"We need to ensure that every school has a qualified and dedicated SENCO, someone who can lead and manage special educational provision and ensure that the system works for every student.\"\nThe lack of joined-up thinking in Irish special education policy is exacerbating the problem, with the current structure leaving schools to figure out their own approach to SEN provision. While the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) may sanction special classes, without expert leadership, schools struggle to implement the changes needed to provide effective support.\n\"The issue is not just about creating more spaces for children; it's about making those spaces work. We need the right leadership and expertise to make sure those spaces are truly supportive of every child’s needs,\" said Deputy Ward.\nWith the demand for inclusive education growing, the 100% Redress Party TD is calling on the government to officially recognise the role of SENCOs as a statutory senior management position in all schools with special educational provision. This would ensure that schools are equipped to meet the needs of students with special needs, helping them thrive in an inclusive educational environment.\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
