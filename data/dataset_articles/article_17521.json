  "text": "The Federal Government has reintroduced Nigerian History as a compulsory subject in the basic education curriculum, aiming to foster national identity, unity, and responsible citizenship among young Nigerians.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday and signed by the Director of Press and Public Relations, Folasade Boriowo, the Ministry of Education described the reform as a “priceless gift to the nation.”\nMinister of Education, Dr. Maruf Tunji Alausa, and Minister of State, Prof. Suwaiba Sai’d Ahmad, thanked President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for championing the initiative under the Renewed Hope Agenda.\nSPONSOR AD “History is not merely a record of the past but a vital foundation for shaping responsible and patriotic citizens,” they said.\nUnder the revised curriculum, pupils from Primary 1 to JSS3 will study Nigerian History, while SSS1–SSS3 students will take Civic and Heritage Studies, which blends history with civic education.\nTopics to cover include Nigeria’s origins, heroes, traditional institutions, colonial and post-independence governance, and democratic development. The curriculum also promotes civic values such as diversity, responsibility, and service.\nThe ministry said it will work with stakeholders to provide resources, retrain teachers, and monitor implementation. It urged parents and educators to support the reform in raising patriotic and forward-looking citizens.\nSponsored In Nigeria, workers can now earn US Dollars by acquiring domain names for low and have it resold for as much as $18,000 (nearly ₦30Million naira) profit monthly. Top beneficiaries are Civil and Public servants, Doctors, IT experts, Entrepreneurs, Bankers, security, military personnel and many others.
