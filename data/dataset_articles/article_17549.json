  "text": "NORMAL — McLean County Unit 5 high school students will be able to play girls flag football and boys volleyball in the 2026-27 school year.\nThe Unit 5 school board on Wednesday approved both sports. It had previously heard a presentation at its last meeting from Nik Kearfott, athletic director at Normal Community High School, and Wes Temples, athletic director at Normal West about the sports.\nA parent of a college level men's volleyball player praised the sports and Unit 5's interest in it during public comment.\n\"There's a strong and growing interest across the country, local clubs and teams are thriving nationally, cities north of us and south of us are already embracing our game,\" Michael Coleman said. \"I urge you to support this initiative, not just for the athletes it would benefit now, but for the legacy of the district that values the opportunity of inclusivity and student voice.\"\nPeople are also reading…\nAccording to a survey cited by the athletic directors and conducted in the 2024-25 school year, more than 2,000 Unit 5 high school students showed significant interest in the new sports, with approximately 44% saying they were interested in both being added.\nGirls flag football, which has been sanctioned by the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) since 2024, would be a fall sport with a maximum of 25 games scheduled for the fall season. A team would visit other schools and play multiple games during the same event.\nSeven teams make up the Big 12 conference in 2025, including schools from Peoria, Danville and Champaign-Urbana.\nThe estimated costs for flag football include about $6,000 for equipment, $2,340 to pay officials and $13,644 to hire coaches.\nKearfott previously said the sport has grown rapidly in recent years, even with Illinois Wesleyan University adding a team for 2026, and Unit 5 plans to showcase the sport further by hosting events on Friday nights leading into boys football games.\nAs for boys volleyball, it would be a spring sport, and the season would be up to 35 matches with multiple games planned for the same day, similar to lacrosse.\nThe sport has been IHSA-sanctioned since 1992. Other schools in the Big 12 conference are considering the sport, and Normal West currently has it active as a club sport.\nEquipment is estimated to cost about $4,000, while officials and entry fees cost around $3,000. The cost for coaches will be similar to girls volleyball at around $17,482.\nPrior to the vote, two public commenters expressed support for boys volleyball and said it will provide opportunities for a new generation of students. No one spoke about flag football.\nAimee Biles, founder and executive director of the Normal Flight Volleyball Club, said volleyball is one of the fastest-growing sports in the country for boys and it's inclusive for all body shapes and sizes.\nWith the season in the spring, it would allow more players to be multisport athletes and become more competitive, Biles said.\nMore importantly, it offers students an opportunity to build their confidence, Biles said.\n\"The more we can get these kids in athletics, the more they're going to stay away from things that we don't want them in,\" Biles said.\nColeman, who is the husband of school board member Kentrica Coleman, said his son Jeremy has been playing volleyball since 2020 with his friends, but he has had to drive up to Joliet three nights a week for the last five years to play.\nJeremy Coleman is now part of the men's volleyball team at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a historically Black university that competes in NCAA Division I.\nKentrica Coleman said she wanted to highlight that this issue is not just about her son's story.\n\"It's about those who follow Jeremy and creating those opportunities for others,\" she said. \"I am glad to be a part of Unit 5 that's willing to pioneer those opportunities for our students.\"\nPhotos: Bloomington at Normal Community during Intercity Boys Soccer\nBelieve Orrick 1 090825.JPG\n1 Giovanni Hurtado 1 090925.JPG\nHugo Murillos 1 090925.JPG\nKai White 1 090925.JPG\nLucas Frank 1 090925.JPG\nMateo Sangucho 1 090925.JPG\nMateo Sangucho 2 090925.JPG\nMateo Sangucho 3 090925.JPG\nMatt Chapman 1 090925.JPG",
