It is here that we relax after a tiring day, gain energy, and enjoy our closest relationships. Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese science that believes that the position and decoration of things around us affect our life energy. If the Feng Shui of the bedroom is right, it not only gives better sleep but also improves relationships, mental peace, and health.

It disrupts the energy and can cause mental instability.\n● If the mirror is in front of the bed and cannot be taken out, cover it with a cloth at night.

According to Feng Shui, clutter attracts negative energy and can make you mentally stressed.\n● Keep cupboards, drawers, and under-bed spaces clean and organised.

Avoid pictures of lonely people, art depicting war, or sadness.
