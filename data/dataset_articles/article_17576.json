Junior Secondary students will cover topics such as early Nigerian civilisations, pre-colonial states, West African empires, European contacts, amalgamation, independence struggles, and democratic governance, blended with civic values to promote national unity.\nThe Ministers described the reform as a \"priceless gift to the nation,\" saying it would reconnect children with their roots while instilling pride and responsibility.\nThey added that embedding civic education in the curriculum would equip learners with the values needed to respect diversity, uphold institutions, and contribute positively to society.\n\"The Education Ministry has released the revised curriculum for Primary and Junior Secondary levels and said it will partner with stakeholders to provide resources, retrain teachers, and monitor implementation.\n\"The federal government urged parents, educators, and communities to support the initiative, which it described as a shared responsibility in raising disciplined and patriotic citizens,\" the statement further read.\nRead the original article on Vanguard .",
