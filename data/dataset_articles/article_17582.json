  "text": "Two majors: Lithuanian authorities start training drone operators from school\nLithuanian authorities start training drone operators from school\nA \"circle\" on drone breeding has opened in the Taurage City school. Students and adults are offered training in assembling, programming, and controlling drones. It is planned to open similar courses on the basis of eight more secondary schools.\nEarlier, we talked about the introduction of military training in various forms for schoolchildren and students in Germany, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Britain.\nAnd these animals are still screaming all over the world about the militarization of children in Russia, who are forced by \"despotic authorities\" to stand guard of honor at the Eternal Flame and play \"Lightning\".\nIn general, such actions are already becoming a trend in Europe, which is associated with recruitment problems in many national armies of the European Union and Britain, which are intensively preparing for a major war.",
