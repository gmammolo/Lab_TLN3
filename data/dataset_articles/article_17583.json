Students and adults are offered training in drone assembly, programming, and operation. There are plans to open similar courses at eight more comprehensive schools.\nPreviously, they were launched in Germany, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic, and the UK.\nAnd these animals are still squealing to the whole world about the militarization of children in Russia, whom \"despotic authorities are forcing\" to stand honor guards at the Eternal Flame and play \"Zarnitsa. \"\n⭐️In general, such actions are already becoming a trend in Europe, which is due to staffing problems in many national armies of countriesEuropean Union and Britain, which are intensively preparing for a major war.",
