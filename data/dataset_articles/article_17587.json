  "text": "Paediatric researcher awarded NSW Young Tall Poppy Science Award for outstanding contributions to childhood health outcomes\nWestern Sydney University researcher and global expert in paediatric and public health nutrition, Dr Catharine Fleming, has been named a 2025 NSW Young Tall Poppy – a prestigious award that recognises scientific excellence.\nNow in its 27th year, the Young Tall Poppy Science Awards, an initiative of the Australian Institute of Policy and Science (AIPS), celebrates researchers who combine cutting-edge science with a genuine passion for engaging and inspiring others.\nThe award acknowledges researchers leading innovation in their field, by not only advancing knowledge but laying the foundation for long-term benefits to communities across Australia.\nDr Fleming, from the University’s School of Health Sciences, Young and Resilient Research Centre, and Translational Health Research Institute, is a passionate advocate for the rights of children and adolescents worldwide. Her research focuses on ensuring all young people around the world have equal access to nutritious diets, allowing them to grow and thrive.\n“Every child has the right to food, health, and water to support their growth and well-being,” said Dr Fleming.\n“My work focuses on protecting against lifelong chronic disease through investigating different aspects of feeding and diet in the most teachable moments of childhood and adolescence.”\nHaving led many global projects with partners including UNICEF, World Vision, the Young and Resilient Research Centre and more, Dr Fleming’s work has shaped global nutrition policy.\nHer findings were included in the influential UNICEF 2019 State of the World’s Children report and her consultations with children around the world, to voice their lived experience of their food systems, were featured in the UN Secretary General’s Global Food Systems Summit in September 2021 and most recently at the Nutrition for Growth Summit 2025 in Paris.\nDr Fleming’s research into child and infant nutrition aims to give every child the very best start to life. Her 2023 compositional assessment of baby and toddler foods (opens in a new window) has improved nutrition outcomes for young Australian children through informing policy and practice.\nThe Young Tall Poppy awards encourage younger Australians, in schools and the wider community, to follow in the footsteps of the outstanding achievers by considering science-based careers and study.\nDr Fleming said it’s a privilege to encourage young people, especially young girls, to explore and understand nutrition in their everyday lives.\n“I am in awe of the passion young people have to lead change and speak out about what sustained action is needed at all levels to drive change for their nutritional outcomes.”\n“Young people are the future and game changers within science. By encouraging young people to be involved in research and providing the platform to achieve this through child led research, we can support the next generation of scientists.”\nProfessor Sarah Lewis, Dean of the School of Health Sciences said this significant achievement is a testament to Dr Fleming’s commitment to creating engaging and research backed scientific information.\n“This award celebrates Dr Fleming’s pioneering contributions to science and dedication to public engagement. She is a wonderful role model to aspiring young scientists,” said Professor Lewis.\n“To be recognised in this highly competitive award scheme showcases Dr Fleming’s expertise as a leader of innovation in paediatric and public health nutrition and as an outstanding scientist.”\nENDS\n8 September 2025\nLatest News\nWestern Sydney University leads national collaboration to transform the future of horticulture\nWestern Sydney University has launched the ARC Training Centre for Smart and Sustainable Horticulture, a national collaboration that brings together leading universities and industry partners.\nOpinion: New climate report warns property prices face a $611 billion hit.
