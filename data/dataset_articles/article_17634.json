  "text": "A new cohort of master’s and PhD students are embarking on their academic journeys at NYU Shanghai. This year, approximately 250 new students were admitted to the master’s and PhD programs, coming from countries such as China, United States, Netherlands, France, Germany, Indonesia.\nPhD Programs\nPhD programs in eight disciplines welcomed 22 new students. Currently, NYU Shanghai collaborates with NYU’s Graduate School of Arts and Science, the Tandon School of Engineering, and the Wagner School of Public Service to offer nine joint PhD programs, with over 73 doctoral students currently enrolled and 22 alumni.\nOn July 12, new PhD students participated in the 2025 First-Year Doctoral Summer Camp, alongside their peers from other NYU schools, senior students, and alumni. The event helped newly enrolled doctoral students prepare for their PhD journey and connect with peers through icebreakers, alumni sharing sessions, and other activities.\nTeaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)\nOn July 5th, the Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) master’s program, a joint program of NYU Shanghai and NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, held an orientation to welcome the Class of 2027. This cohort marks TESOL’s eighth cohort of students enrolled since 2018.\nOver the next two years, the Class of 2027 will take courses on teaching world languages, teaching to second language learners, and intercultural perspectives on multicultural education. Next summer they will participate in an immersive learning experience in New York.\nNYU Stern – NYU Shanghai MS Programs\nThe NYU Stern – NYU Shanghai MS Programs orientation was held at NYU Stern School of Business on May 28, 2025. The orientation welcomed Class of 2026 students from the MS in Quantitative Finance (MSQF), MS in Data Analytics and Business Computing (MSDABC), MS in Marketing and Retail Science (MSMRS), and MS in Organization Management and Strategy (MSOMS) programs.\nOver the summer, students completed foundational courses at Stern and visited local enterprises, gaining exposure to local business culture and networking with industry professionals. On August 29, the students attended their fall orientation at NYU Shanghai. NYU Shanghai Dean of Business Chen Yuxin addressed the new cohort, highlighting the unique opportunities and resources available in both New York City and Shanghai.\nInteractive Media Arts\nOn July 7, 37 new students in the Master’s in Interactive Media Arts (IMA Low Res) program, jointly offered by NYU Shanghai and NYU Tisch School of the Arts, began their studies in New York. This is the sixth cohort of the IMA Low Res program, and the students come from diverse professional backgrounds in technology, design, film and music production. They will continue exploring the creation, application, and understanding of interactive media, developing creative expression, and critical thinking skills with the program. After a summer of study, the students held their summer semester exhibition in New York on August 13.\nMSW Program at Shanghai and New York\nOn August 29, the Master of Social Work Program at Shanghai and New York, jointly offered by NYU Shanghai and the NYU Silver School of Social Work, welcomed its eleventh cohort of students to the New Bund campus.\nDuring their orientation, the students heard well wishes from NYU Shanghai Dean of Arts and Sciences David G. Atwill and MSW program faculty, while Dean of NYU Silver Michael A. Lindsey and Director of the MSW Program Cora de Leon welcomed the new students via videoconferencing.\nWhile studying and exploring in Shanghai, the students will complete half of their required 900 hours of practicum at local service agencies, hospitals, and schools throughout Shanghai during the 2025-26 academic year before heading to New York in their second year.\nNYU Semester Study Programs\nThis semester, NYU Shanghai welcomed another cohort of graduate students from the NYU Semester Study Programs to the Shanghai campus from three programs: NYU School of Professional Studies Master of Science in Integrated Marketing, NYU School of Professional Studies Master of Science in Management & Analytics, and NYU Tandon School of Engineering Master of Science in Management of Technology. These students will spend their first semester living in Shanghai and taking coursework at NYU Shanghai before heading to New York for the remainder of their program, gaining a unique two-campus, international study experience for their master’s degree.\nAt the orientation, NYU Shanghai warmly welcomed the students, and the deans and program directors extended their greetings, wishing everyone a successful start to the new semester in Shanghai.",
