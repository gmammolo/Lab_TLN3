  "text": "Danh Võ solo exhibition Let’s Start Over reopens Duddell’s restaurant in Hong Kong after an interior redesign by Andre Fu Studio. Running from September 17, 2025, to April 6, 2026, the show explores identity, memory, and heritage through objects that merge the personal with the historical. Works include gold-leaf covered cardboard, religious relics, and items drawn from Võ’s family archive, each arranged to highlight quiet transformation and reflection.\nThe exhibition takes its title from Wong Kar-wai’s film Happy Together, echoing the theme of renewal. Rather than overwhelming the viewer, the pieces create a contemplative environment where everyday materials are recast as carriers of meaning. Within the newly reopened space, art and dining intersect to frame a dialogue between culture and community. Let’s Start Over highlights how subtle shifts in material and context can reframe history, memory, and belonging.\nImage Credit: Concept Visual Atelier\nDanh Võ Solo Show Let’s Start Over Reopens Duddell’s in Hong Kong\nAmy Duong— September 18, 2025 —\nArt & Design\nReferences: instagram\nTrend Themes\n1.
