  "text": "Geauga County commissioners Jim Dvorak and Ralph Spidalieri recently endorsed a proposed new program at Kent State University’s College of Applied and Technical Studies, which would allow students to earn a bachelor’s degree in three years.\nAs the university works through internal approvals for the program, “one of the things that is helpful … is to have support of the communities which we serve at our regional campuses,” said Associate Dean Susan Emens, asking the commissioners to sign a letter at their meeting last week.",
