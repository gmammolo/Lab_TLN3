  "text": "Williamsburg Public Library celebrates 75 years\nIn 1950, two volunteers from the local Women’s Civic Club began the Williamsburg Public Library in a small back room inside the former borough building.\nNow in its 75th year, the library is celebrating with events including a historical trivia night, a “behind the scenes” event with a local author and the grand opening of the Williamsburg Historical Society.\nLibrary Director Roane Lytle said they are “very fortunate” to feel the support of the community over 75 years.\nThe ‘will’ in Williamsburg\nCertainly, the library does not look the same as it did 75 years ago.\nFor starters, the library has moved locations twice throughout its duration.\nThe library moved from the borough building in the mid-1960s into the former Farmer’s and Merchant’s Bank in town, according to Lytle. In 2002, the library moved to its current location inside of the historical Presbyterian church.\nTo accommodate the books, shelves were added, along with offices, he said. In the last three years, they received a USDA grant to replace flooring downstairs, children’s furniture and furniture for their garden.\nNot only is the space different, but the technology is as well.\nAssistant librarian Jennifer Hoffman said she came across a black and white photograph of the library getting its first big screen computer.\n“The big thing then was getting that computer,” she said.\nFour large screen computers can be currently found in their computer room, along with laptops, iPads, robots and a 3D printer.\nThe staff wants to “move with the times,” Hoffman said, while keeping their paperback books available to the community.\nThey also provide fast, reliable internet for local residents as well, Lytle said.\nWhen the COVID pandemic raged throughout the world, the library received a federal grant to improve its internet. Lytle said the library is one of the only places in Williamsburg that provides free and accessible internet.\nWith over 1,000 patrons, he said the establishment has been open to help the community, and as a result, their support has been “amazing.”\nAnniversary celebration\nThis week, the library planned events open to the local community in celebration of a milestone anniversary.\n“I want to bring in more faces,” Hoffman said. “I want to keep bringing people in.”\nTo entice people, the library hosted a historical trivia night Wednesday with Biddle’s Brewing.\nBrittany Biddle, co-founder of Biddle’s Brewing, said that because they have partnered with the library in the past, they “jumped” on the invitation for Wednesday’s event.\nAt the event, there was a deck containing a mix of questions about Williamsburg history, as well as library trivia. Biddle’s Brewing also provided coffee to participants.\nHoffman said the library is trying to partner with local businesses like Biddle’s Brewing, and like the library, Biddle said her coffee shops work with local nonprofits to be an “active part” of the community.\n“I am an old soul literature lover at heart,” Biddle said, adding that her coffee shops and the library are a “perfect combination.”\nCirculation supervisor Susan Lytle said she was “looking forward” to trivia night because all of the library events this week are “great.”\nOn Saturday morning, the organization also plans to open the Williamsburg Historical Society to the public, which can be found in the library’s basement.\nFor now, the society will only be open to the public once a week, Hoffman said, but it may expand its hours depending on the volume of people who want to visit.\nIncluded in the exhibit will be artifacts connected to town founder William Ake’s collection, history pieces from the high school and other historical items, she said.\nShe also said the society plans to switch out items on display to give people a chance to see different collection pieces.\n“We want to showcase everything we have, and we want people to see everything as time goes on,” Hoffman said.\nHonoring history\nSusan Lytle said her mother served on the Blair County Library Board in the 1960s. Their mother was one of the original people on that board, according to Roane Lytle.\nWhile Susan Lytle was at home, she said she came across a vase with her mother’s signature at the bottom.\nFor the celebration, Susan said she used the vase to store flowers to “represent” her mother, adding she has been “connected” with the library since she was a child.\nMaintaining its history, members of the Women’s Civic Club still serve on the local library board today, said Civic Club treasurer Carlee Ranalli. There are currently five representatives from the club on the board.\n“It shows the (club’s) commitment to education and fostering a sense of community,” she said.\nRanalli said the club’s original vision of a space for the community to “connect and learn” is still a big part of the library’s mission today.\nHoffman hopes the celebration will “bring more people” into the library as they continue to reach out to the community.\nMirror Staff Writer Colette Costlow is at 814-946-7414.\nIf you go\nThursday, Sept. 18:\n4:30 p.m. – Behind the scenes with local author Patty A. Wilson\nSaturday, Sept. 20:\n9 a.m. – Historical Walking Tour of Williamsburg\n10 a.m. – Grand opening of Williamsburg Historical Society\nNoon-4 p.m. – Bake & Book sale\n1 p.m. – Minister Matt with TurtleDance music\n2:30 p.m. – Pollinator Garden Presentation\nAll events are free of charge",
