  "text": "STEM Co-Lab, at Desert Research Institute, holds grand opening\nRENO, Nev. (KOLO) - The Robert Z. Hawkins Foundation STEM Co-Lab opened on the Desert Research Institute’s campus in Reno on Wednesday, Sept. 17.\nAs part of its grand opening celebration, there were tours of the co-lab, showcasing the Lending Library designed to loan Washoe County educators science and technology equipment to use in their classrooms or after-school programs.\nThere were also hands-on demonstrations including 3D printers, hydroponics, Photon Robots, atom theory, microscopes, Circuit Maker, and electricity and circuitry.\nThe co-lab has a dedicated space for educator professional development trainings and STEM education events for the community.\nThe STEM Co-Lab was funded with generous support from the Robert Z. Hawkins Foundation, which is dedicated to advancing STEM education in Northern Nevada.\nIn 1959, the non-profit research institute was founded “to empower experts to focus on science that matters,” according to the Desert Research Institute’s website. “We work with communities across the state – and the world – to address their most pressing scientific questions.\"\nThe institute is located at 2215 Raggio Parkway in Reno.\nCopyright 2025 KOLO.
