  "text": "How Generation Alpha’s expectations of higher education will transform college design\nSeptember 18, 2025\nSeptember 18, 2025\nEmbedding mental wellness, technology, and inclusive design into the future of higher education environments\nIn three short years, there will be a new generation of students arriving with new expectations of higher education. Are you—and your university—ready?\nToday, we have a chance to design for the next group of students coming to college campuses—Generation Alpha. Right now, this youngest generation is still in primary and secondary school. But architects and interior designers can observe, learn from, and interpret what we find into our school designs.\nFirst, let’s define the generations that are in higher education today or soon will be there. Generation Z includes people who were born between 1997 and 2012. Generation Alpha are those born between 2010 and 2025 (note the two-year overlap, which experts will likely resolve in time). Gen Alpha’s parents are mostly known as the Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996.\nBefore we try to understand Gen Alpha, let’s start with a quick look at Gen Z.\nThe eldest of Gen Z entered college nearly a decade ago, while the youngest are still in middle school. Gen Z will be the most educated and the last generation to be majority white “non-Hispanic” in the US, according to USA Facts. As a group, they put a lot of value on higher education, are motivated by financial success, and advocate for inclusion, sustainability, and independence.\nThis generation values services over amenities on the college campus. Those expectations of higher education resulted in the “One Stop Shop” student services centers now found on many campuses. It also has driven the rise of LEED buildings and sustainability policies. Some Gen Zers were in college during the pandemic and endured years of higher education via a laptop screen. The impact of isolation and years of anxiety is now spread to the workplace. Read more about that in our article, “From A to Gen Z: Designing better workspaces for everyone.”\nGenerally, Gen Zers prefer student housing with social interaction—but they want it on their own terms. While this group is very cost-conscious, they demand aesthetically pleasing spaces. They want the best value for their educational experience.\nGen Z’s experience during the pandemic has driven the desire for single-occupant units. Shared lounges and kitchens, along with communal study spaces and semi-private study rooms, are prolific across the country. We’re seeing a need for “together but separate.”\nOur designers put this trend into action with the Western Michigan University Arcadia Flats. This residence hall in Kalamazoo offers five unit types. They were developed to “fill the spectrum” between the residence hall and apartment options already available on campus. The units range from two-story urban lofts to studio flats, compact two-bed apartments, single occupancy semi-suites, and double occupancy semi-suites. The options offer a variety of price points. They also allow students to feel comfortable in a variety of cultural and social conditions, while still being a part of the whole campus community. Read more about this in my colleague Meg Schubert Allen’s blog post about meeting post-COVID students where they are with an efficient middle housing solution on campus.\nMoving to Generation Alpha: It’s the first to be connected to technology from birth. It’s not surprising that they are adept at using smart devices before they learn to read. Their heightened sense of being a global citizen stems from instant access to information.\nThis group questions the need for traditional education, given the ability to learn virtually or via online tutorials (thanks COVID-19). With access to any smart device, Gen Alpha can learn how to do just about anything and make connections across the world—all before obtaining their driver’s license. Though if you ask, many Gen Alpha teens do not see the need to learn to drive. They’ll often just take a ride share or ask mom.\nHaving gone through the COVID-19 pandemic, Gen Alpha has already had a dramatic impact on the K-12 education system. They endured years of education at home. As such, some have fallen behind in traditional academics, lack social maturity, and developed a general sense of apathy toward rules and structure—at least according to my resident Gen Alpha teen.\nGen Alpha is the largest generational cohort with the majority having college-educated parents (and the majority in single-family homes). This group is ethnically diverse and climate conscious. Also, many identify as gender diverse and/or neurodiverse. They tend to value family time/connections and place great emphasis on mental health, all of which will translate into their expectations of higher education.\nAt the K-12 level, design has already pivoted to the expectations of Gen Alpha. Our team is providing unique designs that are tailored to the community and the student body for each facility. In Texas, Gunn Junior High and Fine Arts and Dual Language Academy in the Arlington Independent School District was inspired by three core values: freedom, creativity, and empathy—each value pulled from the community it serves. Each junior high student at Gunn can explore their interests in various art programs, which also include dual-language instruction, reflecting the diverse community. This intertwined program allows the students to be creative while connecting with classmates from different cultures, preparing them to be culturally responsible citizens.\nThe first Gen Alpha students are three to four years from college. But what they expect from higher education will include personalized education and campus life. Schools can cater to these students by using technology in everyday learning, providing personalized learning options, and fostering a sense of community among students. Facilities will need to look, feel, and sound a little different than they have traditionally. Campuses will need to embrace inclusive design, address neurodiversity (sound, textures, wayfinding, lighting, furniture, and transitions), and use tech and AI in all elements (for example, phone “key” in lieu of a physical key or keycard and boosted Wi-Fi and cellular service). While most of these learning pedagogies or environments are not new, Gen Alpha will expect them to be the norm.\nSocial and mental mindfulness: Often, Gen Alpha’s parents have created a balanced childhood and open dialogue on any topic. That makes Gen Alpha students hyper aware of their own social and mental health needs. Taking a brain break, a social break, or attending a “sleepunder” instead of a sleepover, where they return home for sleep after the party. These are just a few ways this group deals with a deeper understanding of their personal needs. Gen Alpha has a higher rate of neurodiversity than any previous generation, being diagnosed four times more (compared with 20 years ago) or self identifying on the spectrum, states The State University of New Jersey. Knowledge of and acceptance of neurodiversity is shaping learning environments, especially in the K-12 world. Gen Alpha’s expectations of higher education will be this: recognize their differences.\nArchitects and interior designers can observe, learn from, and interpret what we find into our school designs.\nCan a “stand and deliver classroom” or 100-plus-student lecture hall provide a positive learning space for a neurodiverse student? Ask your colleagues. Honestly, those types of learning spaces were marginal at best for even the “neurotypical” individuals. Higher ed institutions must do better by providing learning experiences that are more personal and flexible. They also need sensory spaces and respite spaces, with the faculty willing to adapt to an inclusive pedagogy. Inclusive design is the new accessible design standard.\nInfused with technology: Gen Alpha wants interactive and immersive learning methods. These include virtual reality and gamification as a baseline. That presents both challenges and opportunities for educators. If universities or colleges are behind in rolling out seamless tech or flex learning opportunities, they will lose out on some students.\nHere’s a place to start: Place electrical outlets everywhere so students can charge all their devices. But, really, it’s about more than outlets. The focus should be on providing support for hybrid learning or engagement. One example of expectations of higher education today is for multiple virtual simulation rooms for health sciences education. Previously, this was nice to have technology, but today it is a required and integral part of training programs.\nDesign for inclusivity: Inclusive design considers diversity from the outset. The goal is to include individuals in all aspects of the experience. Here are some straightforward elements of inclusive design that are easy to adopt.\nThe ZenDen, designed by our Research and Benchmarking group, is the result of sensory-enabled architecture (SEA). SEA engages senses—sight, sound, touch, scent, and more—in a holistic and immersive experience. SEA creates environments that relax or stimulate, providing users a greater sense of comfort and safety. Comfort and safety are part of future student expectations of higher education. These types of sensory rooms are beneficial to everyone. But they are especially helpful for a student needing a break from overstimulation or a little too much screen time.\nFunding and lack of understanding are the biggest hurdles for inclusive design. Often, the things that get “value engineered” out of a project are the very things that are needed for inclusive design. Clear definitions of initial project goals for inclusive design will help the owner and the design team identify the must-have things for a successful project.\nAs with each generation before, Gen Alpha will have greater expectations of higher education. In return, those students bring more to the table to hopefully make the world a little better than before.\nGen Alpha is arriving soon with its expectations of higher education. Universities and colleges will have to work harder to attract these inquisitive, diverse, world-changing individuals.\nAn inclusive design approach for higher education facilities and student housing is no longer optional. Gen Alpha students want to be included, and they also want to see their peers included in all the experiences. With a little perspective, even the Boomers know this inclusive design approach is the right direction.",
