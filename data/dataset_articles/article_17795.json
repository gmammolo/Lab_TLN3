  "text": "AUSTIN – From September 14-20, 2025, the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) is celebrating Adult Education and Family Literacy (AEFL) Week. This week highlights the importance of adult education and family literacy programs for people and communities in Texas. To launch this year’s celebration, Governor Greg Abbott issued a proclamation recognizing AEFL Week in Texas.\n“Our Adult Education and Literacy programs provide accessible and supportive pathways for adult learners to gain the skills they need to succeed,” said TWC Commissioner Representing Labor Alberto Treviño III. “These programs are designed to provide adult learners with the tools they need to achieve their goals.”\nTWC works with eligible providers across the state to provide Adult Education and Literacy (AEL) services that help Texans learn new skills by teaching reading, writing, math, and English in a variety of program models. Program model options may include access to workforce training, digital literacy, work readiness and college preparation coursework. AEL providers deliver these services through in person and online class options. AEL services are provided at no cost to adult learners who lack functional literacy or have not earned a high school diploma (or recognized equivalent).\n“A strong Texas economy starts with a skilled workforce,” said TWC Commissioner Representing Employers Joe Esparza. “Adult Education and Literacy resources empower Texans to achieve their goals and become competitive in the workforce while providing talented employees to our Texas businesses.”\nTexas residents who are 21 or older can get vouchers from local AEL programs to help pay for the GED exam, which is a high school equivalency test. TWC has awarded more than 10,000 vouchers this year. Contact your nearest AEL Provider to participate in or learn more about Adult Education and Literacy services.",
