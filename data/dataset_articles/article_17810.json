  "text": "All four-year-olds in St. Charles Parish can attend pre-K at their neighborhood public schools next fall after the school board approved an expansion of its pre-K program during its August 20 meeting.\nThe expansion will open 19 new pre-K classes for four-year-olds across school sites, serving about 380 more four-year-old students. The program currently serves 503 total students in its pre-K3 and pre-K4 programs.\nWhile participation is not mandatory, any 4-year-old in the parish will have the opportunity to attend St. Charles Parish Public Schools, according to Angelle Babin, assistant superintendent of curriculum, instruction, and assessment for St. Charles Parish Public Schools.\nBabin said data on early indicators of success, such as literacy, language, math, physical and social-emotional development, consistently show the strength of the district’s Head Start and school site programs in preparing children to be kindergarten ready.\n“Expanding access was the natural next step to extend these benefits to more students in our community,” she said. “Offering pre-K4 at neighborhood schools means children begin their educational journey in the same place they will continue for kindergarten and beyond. This reduces transitions, builds stronger connections with teachers and peers, and allows students to grow as part of their school community from the very start.”\nBy next fall, the district’s two Head Start sites, Eastbank Head Start and Carver Early Learning Centers, will transition to serving only three-year-old students and will add up to five new classes.\n“Although we do not offer a universal pre-K program for three-year-olds, the expansion will allow us to serve more three-year-olds than in the past,” Babin said.\nThe district significantly expanded access to its pre-K program for the 2019-2020 school year by doubling the number of seats at school sites. With the addition of one pre-K class at each elementary school, the district added spots for 120 students.\n“Since then, the St. Charles Parish School Board has continued to prioritize early childhood education, restructuring the early childhood department and adding pre-K instructional coaches over the past two years to strengthen teaching and learning,” Babin said.\nThe proposal for universal pre-K was spearheaded by Superintendent Dr. Ken Oertling and the St. Charles Parish School Board, Babin said. Feedback from families and school leaders also shaped the proposal to expand the program.\n“Families have expressed a clear preference for their children to begin pre-K at the same neighborhood schools they will attend for kindergarten and beyond,” Babin said. “Likewise, school leaders welcome the opportunity to acclimate students to their school communities earlier, setting the stage for a smoother and more successful transition into kindergarten.”\nThe expanded program will cost about $1.6 to $2.1 million each year, which will cover the salaries for additional pre-K teachers, pre-K3 instructors, and paraeducators. The ongoing cost will be funded by the school board.\nThe school board also approved a one-time investment of $336,000 for classroom furniture and technology.\n“This funding decision underscores the board’s belief that an investment in pre-K is an investment in long-term student success,” Babin said. “By providing this strong foundation, the district is investing not only in individual student success but also in the long-term strength of our school system.”\nAny child who will be four-years-olds by Sept. 30, 2026 is eligible to attend pre-K at their neighborhood school. Children who turn three-years old by Sept. 30, 2026 can apply for the pre-K3 programs at Eastbank Head Start and Carver Early Learning Centers. Families must complete the Network Application process, which includes providing proof of residency and income verification, because some pre-K seats are funded through state and federal programs.\nApplications for pre-K3 and pre-K4 will be available online in February 2026, and families are encouraged to apply at that time. The registration process requires families to submit certain paperwork to either Head Start site for processing. Families will be notified of their child’s placement in April and can expect to receive follow-up information directly from their child’s school shorty after.\nBabin said the ongoing investment reflects the district’s commitment to excellence and aligns with one of the Louisiana Department of Education’s critical goals: ensuring that children enter school kindergarten ready.\n“By engaging our youngest learners in pre-K4 programs, we provide a strong foundation for future success,” Babin said. “Each year, our prekindergarten classrooms are filled with eager students who are building skills, confidence, and a love for learning.”",
