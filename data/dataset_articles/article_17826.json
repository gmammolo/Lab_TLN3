  "text": "On Monday, September 15, a large gathering of parents, children and community members gathered at 606 First Street in Providence to celebrate the grand opening of the Webco Learning Center. Free hot dogs, inflatables and face painting welcomed potential students and their parents, and tours of the new facility were given by staff members. The facility, parking lot and street were a hubbub of excitement.\nProvidence celebrates new childcare facility\n- By David R, Drennan For The Journal-Enterprise\n0\nPost a comment as anonymous\nReport\nWatch this discussion.
