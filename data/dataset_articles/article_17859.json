  "text": "Duluth 1200 Fund Announces Childcare Grant Recipients\nDULUTH, Minn. — The Duluth 1200 Fund has awarded $150,000 in grants to 21 local childcare facilities.\nOn Sep. 17, Duluth 1200 Fund board members, funding partners, and City of Duluth staff gathered at the new Divine Konnections childcare center in West Duluth to announce their Tiny Steps Childcare Grant recipients.\nTogether, they celebrated the expansion of not only the Divine Konnections programs, but childcare across the Northland, in large thanks to the city’s support.\n“We’re going to disperse just over $150,000 in total grants to these providers all across Duluth, and it will support the creation of 70 new childcare slots,” said 1200 Fund Board President Laura Mullen. “This represents a broad mix of child center-based and family-based providers all across the city in ensuring equitable access to childcare services.”\nBy increasing access to childcare, the funding supports both working families in the region, and Duluth’s economic growth.\n“I’m also a working mom (of a) seven, eight and a five-year-old, so I, firsthand, know the importance of childcare and the impact that it has not only on our workforce when somebody doesn’t have that reliable childcare, but also on our children that maybe don’t have a place to go or a community to grow in,” said Duluth City Counselor Tara Swenson.\nThe 1200 Fund and City of Duluth will be hosting an event to celebrate 40 years of the small business fund on Nov. 12, with Divine Konnections hosting a public open house to introduce their new facility on Sep. 25.\nThe full list of Tiny Steps Childcare Grant Recipients include:\n• Duluth Nature School\n• Mrs. V’s Daycare\n• Pleasant View Playhouse\n• Aunty’s Child Care\n• LaVonne Kerfeld’s Daycare\n• Duluth Preschool of Fine Arts and Education\n• Summit School\n• Congdon Creek Preschool\n• Montessori School of Duluth\n• The Bunny Patch Daycare\n• Hartley Nature Preschool\n• Little Lambs Learning Center\n• Lincoln Park Children and Families Collaborative\n• Dragonfly Childcare\n• University Nursery School (Coppertop & College Street)\n• Lakeside Early Learning\n• Heather’s Happy Days Daycare\n• St. Mary’s Child Care Center\n• Sunny Adventures\n• Krista Comnick",
