  "text": "The Jacksonville Symphony launches its 2025-26 Florida Blue Classical Series on Sept. 26 and 27 in Jacoby Symphony Hall, featuring Aaron Copland’s jazz-inspired Clarinet Concerto performed by Principal Clarinet Giovanni Bertoni. The evening also includes Joel Thompson’s “To See the Sky” and Sergei Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 5, all under the baton of Music Director Courtney Lewis.\nBertoni, celebrated for his expressive artistry and technical brilliance, takes center stage in Copland’s lyrical and virtuosic Clarinet Concerto. Infused with jazz rhythms and sweeping melodies, the concerto remains one of the composer’s most popular works. It also is a nod to the Americana theme audiences will hear throughout the upcoming season as the nation’s 250th anniversary approaches.\nOpening the concert, Thompson’s “To See the Sky” offers an exploration of resilience and hope through layered orchestral writing. The ebbs and flows of the piece are representative of the many emotions one can experience but also highlights the virtuosity of the musicians.\n“The movements outline a non-linear journey towards healing,” said Thompson, something each member of the audience can relate to.\nThe program concludes with Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 5, a sweeping work that captures the strength and spirit of humanity with grand themes, powerful rhythms and emotional intensity.\nTickets are available at JaxSymphony.org or by calling the box office at 904-354-5547. This concert is sponsored by Florida Blue and is part of the Greta Challen Berg Artist Series.\nThe Jacksonville Symphony is North Florida’s leading nonprofit performing arts organization offering live performances at Jacoby Symphony Hall in the Jacksonville Center for the Performing Arts and other venues throughout the area. Led by President and CEO Steven Libman and Music Director Courtney Lewis, the Jacksonville Symphony reaches more than 115,500 individuals through more than 95 performances each season. In addition, the Symphony provides music instruction for youth and operates the Jacksonville Symphony Youth Orchestras.\nFor more information about the symphony, go to JaxSymphony.org.",
