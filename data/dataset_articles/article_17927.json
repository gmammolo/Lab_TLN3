  "text": "MCBAIN — Eighth-graders got an intimate look into area dairies this week during the Wexford-Missaukee region’s first annual Agriculture Day.\nThe career exploration event, taking place on Sept. 17 and Sept. 18, sent students from Cadillac, Manton, Mesick, Lake City, Pine River, Marion and McBain schools to one of four local dairy farms: Lucky 7 Dairy, Benthem Brothers Dairy, Yonkman Dairy and Benson Farms.\nOrganizers say the goal is to give students a broader look at the dairy industry and its career opportunities.\n“We want our students to know that there’s more to agriculture than cows,” said event organizer Niki Schultz, an MSU Extension educator and executive director of the Alliance for Economic Success. “Wexford and Missaukee counties rely heavily, economically, on our dairy farms, so we need kiddos to graduate and come back to the area so they can continue to reinforce agriculture.”\nThe need is real, farmers say. The average Michigan farmer is 56 years old, and fewer than 10% are under 35, according to the USDA’s 2022 Census.\nEach two-hour farm visit gave students the chance to meet with different agriculture experts that spoke about cattle and crop science, cattle health and farm facilities. After the lessons, students were treated to free pizza and milk.\nAt Yonkman Dairy in McBain on Wednesday morning, groups of Manton students got a tour of the farm’s dairy parlor, then heard from area breeders and nutritionists.\n“Any time we can help kids fall in love with agriculture — and shape their opinions on what we do out here to help feed the world — is a good day,” said the nutritionist, Jacob Patterson of Hubbard Feeds.\nPatterson told students about different types of feeds used on the farm, and the science behind the ingredients.\nIn another group, Chris McTaggart of Central Star Breeding guided students through a demonstration of artificial insemination using real uteruses removed from cows.\nLastly, Molly Pluger of Yonkman Dairy showed her group the milking parlor in action. A few students, including Koltyn Grundner, said the parlor’s technology was their favorite part of the tour.\nThe group’s supervisor, Manton Middle School teacher Jon March, said the in-person experience is valuable for students.\n“It’s good for them to step on a farm and see how things work,” March said. “It’s good to have a day like this now.”\nDaniel Schoenherr’s position is funded through Report for America and local fund-raising.
