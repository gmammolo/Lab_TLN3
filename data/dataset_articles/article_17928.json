It’s really relaxing to enjoy the moment and just watch the ducks.”\nDesigning “A Moment in Time” quickly became a passion project. “The best part was probably designing the entire thing,” she said. “It allowed me to expand my creative mind.\nThe annual contest, now in its 10th year, is held in memory of Loeymae Lange, a former elementary art teacher from Burlington who believed deeply in the power of creativity to promote student well-being. After Lange’s passing, her family endowed the contest through the WEA Member Benefits Foundation, which now awards approximately $6,000 in prize money to winning students each year.\nThis year’s theme, “Happiness Is…,” encouraged young artists to reflect on what brings them joy—and to express that visually.\n“For me, happiness flows like a delicate stream,” Amy wrote in her artist statement. “Each brushstroke echoes the delicacy of amber and golden leaves waltzing in the crisp, clear air. The rich colors weave a tapestry of nostalgia… capturing the essence of happiness in every detail, inviting us to pause, take a breath, and explore the beauty that surrounds us.”\nAccording to Steve Goldberg, Executive Director of the WEA Member Benefits Foundation, Amy’s piece was selected for its “exceptional originality, expressive content, artistic elements, and thoughtful approach.” He noted that the inspiration behind the work—a memory of her backyard flooding in August 2018—offered a window into how young people can find beauty in unexpected moments.\n“She saw beauty in a flooded yard,” Goldberg said. “She gave us a line of sight into a memory and the things that make her happy. That’s what made it so powerful.”\nThe contest is open to all K–12 students in Wisconsin and is judged by the creative staff within WEA Member Benefits’ marketing department. Entries are evaluated based on creativity, connection to the theme, originality, and visual impact. This year, in celebration of the contest’s 10th anniversary, the Foundation also created a printed calendar showcasing the top finalists’ artwork.\nIn addition to recognition and prize money, the winning students and their families are invited to an annual celebration in Madison. The event is part of a broader effort by the WEA Member Benefits Foundation to promote student mental health. The finalists’ artwork is displayed at the dinner and throughout the WEA offices, and the artists receive public recognition for their work.\n“The celebration is truly special,” Goldberg said. “You might see a five-year-old walking up to receive a check for their art, and the pride and emotion from the family and audience is just overwhelming. It’s a rare moment for many families to be recognized for something meaningful.”\nGoldberg emphasized the broader impact of the contest, noting the deep connection between creative expression and mental well-being, especially among young people.\n“Art can be a critical outlet for those struggling with trauma, depression, or anxiety,” he said. “Sometimes, when words fail, a piece of art can speak volumes. It helps students explore, express, and even heal.”\nThe WEA Member Benefits Foundation also supports schools statewide by providing multi-year funding to strengthen student mental health services. Grants have helped reduce waiting lists for counseling, expand access to private mental health providers, and improve peer support groups and digital resources.\nFor Amy Ma, the recognition is more than just a ribbon or a check—it’s an affirmation of her ability to express something universal through her personal lens.\n“She’s incredibly talented,” Goldberg said. “And her painting reminds us all to slow down, reflect, and find joy in life’s simple, fleeting moments.”",
