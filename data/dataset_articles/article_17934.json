  "text": "BioE Seminar Series: Advancing Regenerative Medicine via Biomaterials Therapy\nAdvancing Regenerative Medicine via Biomaterials Therapy\nBiomaterials science and engineering have revolutionized biological research and regenerative medicine. This presentation explores two disparate therapeutic areas: 4D hydrogels for muscle and ligament regeneration; and, microphysiological systems (MPS) (i.e., organs chips) for mRNA delivery via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).\nMy group has developed modular semi-synthetic hyaluronic acid-based (HyA) hydrogels that mimic native extracellular matrix properties allowing independent control over mechanical and biological characteristics. These 4D HyA hydrogels serve as assistive matrices, coordinating intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of tissue regeneration or progenitor cell survival. Applications in muscle regeneration after traumatic injury and rotator cuff tears will be discussed.\nAdditionally, we have developed various MPS, including a cardiac MPS6, containing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to identify lipid nanoparticle (LNP)/mRNA complexes capable of transfecting cardiomyocytes in a 3D cardiac micromuscle. Our novel acid-degradable PEG (ADP)-LNP formulations have demonstrated enhanced diffusion and gene editing efficiency in the cardiac MPS, with in vivo validation showing higher heart transfection and lower liver uptake compared to standard LNP formulations. This groundbreaking approach, combining organ chip technology with LNP screening, paves the way for advanced non-animal preclinical platforms in drug discovery and the development of new cardiac therapies.\nJessica Canning",
