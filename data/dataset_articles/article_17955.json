  "text": "WINCHESTER — For the second consecutive year, the Leyendo Juntos educational initiative in Winchester commemorated Sept. 11's National Day of Service and Remembrance with family-friendly activities on the Our Health campus on North Cameron Street.\nLeyendo Juntos, part of the Winchester Campaign for Grade-Level Reading, aims to educate, empower and support local Hispanic families to better develop learning and literacy opportunities within the community. The initiative — overseen by the United Way of Northern Shenandoah Valley and the John and Janice Wyatt Foundation — endeavors to find ways to create cross-cultural understanding for families with school-aged children, particularly those with Spanish-speaking parents who may face challenges due to being adult learners of English themselves.\nTo mark last week's Day of Service, Leyendo Juntos offered a program for local Latino families. According to a media release from Orianna Urbaez Largent, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, the event \"provided a safe, welcoming space for children and families to learn about the values of service, unity and community.\"\nWinchester Police Chief Ronnie Lewis, who joined the Winchester Police Department in February, read a bilingual story about history and community to the children in attendance.\n\"His presence emphasized the importance of bridging cultures and building trust between families and local leadership,\" Largent said in the release.\nIn honor of September being Library Card Sign-Up Month, Handley Regional Library joined the Sept. 11 celebration by helping families register for library cards. Lewis received his first Winchester library card at the event to highlight the importance of reading and access to resources for all community members.\nThe Winchester Fire and Rescue Department came to the Our Health campus with an interactive presentation and safety talk. Children and families had the opportunity to learn firsthand about fire safety while connecting with the everyday heroes who protect their city, the release states.\nTo encourage literacy at home, every child in attendance received a free copy of the bilingual book \"My Community\" by 123 Andres — the same book read aloud by Lewis.\n\"Through this event, we want families to know that the values of service and community live on in every generation,\" Largent said in the release.\n\"We are so proud to have Leyendo Juntos as part of the Winchester Campaign for Grade-Level Reading,\" United Way of Northern Shenandoah Valley President and CEO Andy Gail added in the release. \"Seeing this initiative bring families together and empower children through literacy and community is exactly the type of impact we strive for.\"\nTo learn more about Leyendo Juntos, visit http://bit.ly/4prpHcH or email Largent at olargent@unitedwaynsv.org.",
