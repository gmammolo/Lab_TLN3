  "text": "Southern Cross University Esports has hit the national stage, making its live competitive debut at OzComicCon Brisbane.\nA group of 22 students travelled to the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre for the University Esports Showcase on 13 September, hosted by the Australian Esports League (AEL). Southern Cross students competed in Rocket League and Valorant against teams from QUT, UQ and Griffith University.\nSouthern Cross University placed fourth in Rocket League and celebrated bronze in Valorant, marking the University's first-ever live tournament results. Matches were played on stage before a live audience and streamed nationwide via the AEL YouTube channel.\n\"Competing live on stage was unreal. It's one thing to play from home, but being in front of a crowd with your team, it's a whole new level,\" said Rocket League Captain and Bachelor of Counselling student, Matthew Watkins.\nSouthern Cross University Esports Coordinator Tim Joyce described it as a milestone for the University team.\n\"Seeing our students compete live for the first time was a proud moment. They represented the University with skill, confidence, and sporting behaviour,\" he said.\n\"Esports at Southern Cross University is a gateway to real student connection. Events like OzComicCon give our students the chance to step outside the classroom, represent their university, and experience the energy of live competition.\"\nFor many, the event was more than just gaming. Valorant Captain Jiayang Dai, an international student, reflected on the importance of the opportunity.\n\"As an international student, being part of Southern Cross University Esports and attending OzComicCon was an incredible way to feel connected,\" Jiayang said.\n\"Competing on stage, meeting students from other universities, and sharing this experience with my teammates made me feel truly part of the Southern Cross University community. It's opportunities like this that make the student experience here so special.\"\nThe showcase forms part of the AEL University Cup, where SCU Esports students compete weekly online against more than 20 universities across Australia.\nThe Southern Cross Esports team will return to the live stage in November for Supanova Brisbane.\nAre you a current Southern Cross University student interested in Esports?
