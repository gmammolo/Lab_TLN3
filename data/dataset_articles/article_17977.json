  "text": "The National Merit Scholarship Corporation has named 108 Nebraska high school students as semifinalists for the organization's 2026 scholarship program.\nSemifinalists were chosen based on their performance on the 2024 Preliminary SAT test, which serves as the qualifying exam for the program.\nThe organization named 6,000 semifinalists nationwide out of the more than 1.3 million students who took the exam, according to a press release from the organization.\nThe students who score the highest on the exam in each state are chosen as semifinalists, and the number of semifinalists in a state is proportional to the state's percentage of the national total of graduating seniors, according to the release.\nTo become a finalist, semifinalists must submit a detailed scholarship application, have an outstanding academic record throughout high school, be endorsed and recommended by a high school official, write an essay and earn an SAT or ACT score that \"confirms their earlier performance on the qualifying test,\" according to the organization.\nFinalists for the scholarships will be announced in February. Those finalists will be considered for approximately 6,930 scholarships totalling nearly $26 million.\nThe organization expects about 95% of semifinalists to attain finalist standing, and about half of the finalists to win a National Merit scholarship.\nScholarship winners will be announced beginning in April.\nHere are the semifinalists from Nebraska:\nAUBURN\nAuburn High School\nHayes, Jack T.\nAURORA\nAurora High School\nBennett, Scott\nMellies, Brett\nBELLEVUE\nBellevue East High School\nBogatz, Victoria\nBellevue West High School\nParks, Robert J.\nBENNINGTON\nBennington High School\nHoltorf, Jackson\nMumford, Mason\nRapp, Dylan\nBLAIR\nBlair High School\nAnderson, Benjamin L.\nCHADRON\nChadron High School\nCenter, Sofia\nCOLUMBUS\nScotus Central Catholic High School\nStoner, Audrey\nStoner, Jacqueline\nFIRTH\nNorris High School\nWondercheck, Jackson\nGRAND ISLAND\nGrand Island High School\nStephenson, Diana\nLINCOLN\nLincoln Christian School\nDodge, Samuel\nLincoln East High School\nBunjer, Konner\nHaridas, Nitya\nKholmatov, Niloufar\nKumm, Annabelle\nShen, Jeff\nWaite, Caleb\nWiebe, Owen\nLincoln High School\nBrassil, Oliver\nGreen, Everett\nKruse, Abby\nWegener, Verity\nLincoln North Star High School\nChong, Ann\nLincoln Northeast High School\nCrosgrove, Ciara\nLincoln Northwest High School\nPrakapchuk, Timofei\nLincoln Southeast High School\nOgbonnaya, Jeffrey\nPischel, Katelyn\nWitte, Henry\nLincoln Southwest High School\nErickson, Ezra\nHolland, Kainoa\nHung, Brady\nQuach, Ha\nSchultz, Conor\nTemperly, Claire\nVallieppan, Mrudhulaa\nXu, Bella\nMINDEN\nMinden High School\nLempka, Rebbeca\nNEBRASKA CITY\nLourdes Central High School\nBorer, Brooklyn\nOMAHA\nCreighton Preparatory School\nAlsaleem, Hamzah\nFeuerbach, Jacob\nMcgill, Leo\nNoble, Lochlann\nUptmor, John Paul\nDuchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart\nThrasher, Gia T.\nElkhorn High School\nAhern, James\nBennett, Jameson\nBoster, Bridget\nDeprez, Carson\nFisher, Stephen\nHernandez-Tapia, Yuridia\nMorrison, Alexander\nPetrick, Gage\nUnderwood, Maxwell\nElkhorn North High School\nDePew, Emerson A.\nZhang, Erica\nElkhorn South High School\nBerryman, Will B.\nFowler, Ella G.\nHuang, Jinyee A.\nKang, Ratna L.\nKim, Sua\nMadott, Jake D.\nSmoot, Liam A.\nWiesenfeld, Jonathan D.\nWu, Johnathan R.\nMercy High School\nVerdoni, Anna\nMillard North High School\nAthota, Pavan\nBloomingdale, Kyson\nCui, Angela\nDong, Ryan\nErickson, Max\nFang, Ethan\nGanti, Anuraag\nJain, Arnav\nJohnson, Annika\nMoravek, Ian\nNayakwadi, Ridhvi\nSathi, Gowtham\nUm, Matthew\nVemmelesseril, Anagha\nMillard South High School\nCullum, Charlotte\nMillard West High School\nAskew, Lucas\nCottrell, Isaac\nFlorea, Alexandru\nFox, Gideon\nHao, Gary\nOlson, Joshua\nMount Michael Benedictine High School\nPigg, Jaxson L.\nPoutre, Cole C.\nZimmerman, Xavier H.\nOmaha Central High School\nCox, Daniel\nGholami, Adelan\nShapiro, Joshua\nOmaha Westview High School\nMcGrath, Austin P.\nSkutt Catholic High School\nPierce, Collin\nWestside High School\nAgulla, Lucas\nLuebbert, Axel\nWang, BingYi\nYuill, Violet\nPAPILLION\nPapillion-La Vista High School\nBrown, Ava Z.\nWu, Vicky D.\nSCOTTSBLUFF\nScottsbluff High School\nPolk, Logan\nSEWARD\nSeward High School\nAlbright, Kayla\nSIDNEY\nSidney High School\nOnate, Noel\nWATERLOO\nHomeschool/online school\nWhitten, Gavin A.",
