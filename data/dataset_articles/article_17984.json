  "text": "Spelman College Launches New Ombuds Program for Faculty, Staff and Students\nThe Ombuds Office – A Valuable Resource for Faculty, Staff and Students\nSpelman College is pleased to present the launch of the Ombuds Office, a new internal resource to foster trust and inclusion. Faculty, staff, and students can utilize the Ombuds Office for a safe, neutral and confidential space to seek guidance, address concerns, explore solutions, and receive support, all on their own terms. Independent of the President’s Office as well as other administrative departments, the Ombuds Office is an informal process and protects privacy, with the only exception being when there is imminent risk or danger. Whether a community member needs help navigating a difficult decision, or simply needs a listening ear, this office offers an independent, voluntary environment to help each person find a healthy way forward.\nWhy the Ombuds Program Matters\nThe Ombuds Office was created for organizations to provide an effective way to improve culture in the workplace, address systemic issues and resolve challenges before escalation. This office enhances Spelman's dedicated commitment to promoting positive communication and providing a safe space to be heard. The goal of the Ombuds Office is to ensure faculty, staff, and students feel respected and empowered, creating an environment of excellence in collaboration which is paramount for a thriving community.\nMeet Spelman’s Ombudsperson, Erika Walker-Cash\nLeading the Ombuds Program is Erika Walker-Cash, C’97, whose experience uniquely suits her to this important role. She joined Spelman College in August of 2024 and has previously served as an associate dean and professor at the John Marshall Law School, chaired faculty recruitment at Clark Atlanta University (where she obtained a master’s in social work), and has been a tenured-track professor teaching critical race theory as well as civil procedure.\nBefore joining Spelman, Erika worked as a licensed clinical social worker and later as a licensed attorney at Williams Mullen in Virginia. She also served the U.S. House of Representatives as district director and has a long history of guiding individuals through confidential and challenging issues. Erika’s journey is deeply intertwined with Spelman and the AUC, with both her daughter (C’2O22) and son (2015 Morehouse) as graduates.\nErika’s commitment to confidentiality, respectful listening and neutrality is critical to the success of the Ombuds Program’s mission. In her role as Ombudsperson, she will not disclose confidential information to the president, even as she continues to serve as Special Assistant to the President, ensuring the independence and integrity of the office.\nWhat Makes the Ombuds Office Confidential?\nThe Ombuds Program is informal and completely independent from Human Resources and Culture, the President’s Office, and any other administrative department. Communication with the Ombudsperson is not part of any formal record. Excluding individual identification and specific details, only trends are shared with the College’s leadership to support campus-wide improvements. This distinction means community members can now speak freely and confidently, knowing their privacy is carefully protected. The faculty, staff or students control what happens next as the Office will only intervene in situations where safety is at risk.\nHow Is the Ombuds Office Different from HR?\nWith Human Resources, submitting complaints may require a formal process. HR provides advisement and guidance both formally and informally. The Ombuds Office provides off-the-record and informal support for a variety of professional community issues. In addition to providing confidential guidance, the Ombudsperson can also engage in shuttle diplomacy and assist in mediating between members of the community who find themselves at an impasse. Here is a guide for more information on when to visit the Ombuds Office vs. Human Resources:\nHow to Engage the Ombuds Office\nFaculty, staff, and students are encouraged to contact the Ombuds Office directly whenever they need confidential support. Appointments are voluntary and initiated by community members. For more information or to schedule a consultation, contact Erika Walker-Cash or call 404-270-5013.",
