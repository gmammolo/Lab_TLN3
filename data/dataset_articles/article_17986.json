  "text": "Investing in the power of education through sport, Lyceum College takes bold steps to uplift the next generation. The institution awarded two full bursaries to deserving youth from the local sporting community, helping them step into a future filled with opportunity.\nAt Old Parks Soccer Club, Alyssa Taveras, a young woman who will become the first in her family to pursue higher education, received a full bursary from Lyceum College. The club’s ladies team captain’s story is one of resilience and hope, proof that access to education can change the course of a life, a family, and a community.\nRead more: Local college changes lives of youngsters\nThe following day, at WeBox Fitness, another bursary was awarded to Lwezu Mandlate, a promising young boxer who lost his mother at an early age and is being raised by guardians. With tears in his eyes, he said: ”You’ve changed my life for better things. I want to take care of my dad and make him proud.”\nThese moments are more than just symbolic; they reflect Lyceum College’s mission to create real and lasting impact by breaking barriers to education. By reaching out through sport, Lyceum is connecting with youth where they are, helping them to reimagine their potential and their future.\nAlso read: Mailula Football Club call son community to aid them in their good work\nMelanie Williams, head of marketing at the college, said education is the cornerstone of empowerment. “By giving back to the community through these bursaries, we’re investing in young people who are ready to step into their power, and make meaningful contributions to society.”\nYoung boxer Lwezu Mandlate and Melanie Williams of Lyceum College.
