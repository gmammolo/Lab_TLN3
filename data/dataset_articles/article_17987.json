These hubs will provide hands-on AI training to students,” she said, adding that many states are keen to develop the model.\nPointing out the need to urgently upskill India's youth to make them ready for 'quick and direct' employment after completing their education, the finance minister sought the private sector's participation in it.\n\"How to bridge the human resource insufficiencies - not adequately trained, not the kind of degree I want. The rounding off of the personalities is missing. The degree is there, but the individual is not groomed adequately enough to be a part of the large multinationals or Indian companies that you are talking about. That element has to be done by all of us. I would want private sector participation together with the government in readying youth to be fit for quick and direct employment,\" Sitharaman said.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
