  "text": "After more wet weather on the South Coast, there has been a lot of road damage, especially in the Umdoni area.\nIn Scottburgh, particularly, due to inadequate drainage, many roads were waterlogged. As a result, roads began collapsing and cracking, making it dangerous for motorists as well as pedestrians.\nA site visit was done on Monday this week by Clr Dana Daniels at one of the most damaged roads in Scottburgh.\nAt the end of Galway Street (just before the Cordiner Street turn), a massive chunk of the road has collapsed. This section has been cordoned off with tape because of the danger.\n“It is a big concern as not many people know the extent of this damage, and it is quite risky for those driving on this road, especially at night,” said Daniels.\n“The devastating state of our roads after the storm is a direct result of the poor leadership at Umdoni by the ANC. Our service delivery and infrastructure have been neglected over the past 30 years.”\nShe also mentioned that all damaged roads have been reported, and it is just a matter of time before they are attended to.\n“DA councillors remain steadfast in their commitment to championing the community’s best interests,” she said.\nMotorists are asked to be cautious on the roads.\nHAVE YOUR SAY\nLike our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Instagram",
