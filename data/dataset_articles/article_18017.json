  "text": "The federal Labor Party announced its Powering Australia Plan in late 2021, promising to cut National Energy Market (NEM) wholesale power costs by $11 per MWh, from $62 to $51, by 2025.\nLabor bragged that its Powering Australia Plan will save Australians $275 on residential electricity bills in 2025 and $379 in 2030.\nAccording to AEMO, the average cost of producing power across the NEM in Q4 2024 was $88/MWh, 72% higher than the $51 figure promised by Labor.\nAdvertisement",
