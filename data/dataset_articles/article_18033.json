  "text": "In Greene County, some schools and businesses in Eutaw were without power and water today.\nResidents of Carver Circle were hit hard when storms rolled through around 3 am and took down power lines.\nMembers of the housing authority said people are doing the best they can waiting on power to be restored and the city of Eutaw has been helpful during the process.\n\"Residents are pretty much doing the best that they can,” said Mollie Rowe, Eutaw Housing Authority executive director. “We've been flooded with calls about being cold, not being able to use any water, and being fearful.\"\n\"The support has been great coming from our mayor and the city of Eutaw,” said resident manager Mollie Gaines. “They've supplied us with water because at some point the pressure of the water was very low and that caused another impact with our residents.\"\nRowe said the staff checks on their residents frequently and she has been assured power crews are working as fast as they can to get power restored.\n-ls-",
