  "text": "<p class=\"bodytext\">India is set for a harsh summer with temperatures expected to soar above normal and heat waves threatening to impact life in many parts of the country. The India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s forecast of a searing summer is not a surprise because there were recent indications on those lines. IMD has noted that February this year was the warmest since 1901, with the all-India average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures surpassing the normal by far. Both the minimum and maximum temperatures in most parts of the country will remain above normal in the coming weeks. IMD’s forecast for the summer is as important as its monsoon forecast because weather in the next three months will have a bearing on the economy and multiple sectors that impact people’s lives. The summer is also expected to start early, making it a potentially prolonged season.</p>.Don’t play with fire operations.<p class=\"bodytext\">The Met Department also expects the number of heat wave events to be above climatological normal. Heat waves will pose a serious threat to health and may cause death, and can adversely affect work and lifestyles. Governments need to start planning for them and other manifestations of the summer right now. Though there are heat wave action plans and protocols on how to face them, effective action is not taken to counter them. Public advisories should be issued so that people are prepared to face these events. There is a need for efficient water management strategies, and increased healthcare support to mitigate the impact of heat. People should stay hydrated, avoid direct exposure to heat during peak hours, and take precautions to prevent heat-related illnesses. The demand for power will increase in the summer months. A peak power demand of 270 mega watts is expected against last year’s 250 mega watts. States in peninsular India may face acute water shortage.</p>.<p class=\"bodytext\">Extreme weather conditions, including excess pre-monsoon rain and extreme heat, are expected in different parts of Karnataka. While the southern and coastal parts of the state and Malnad may witness excess summer showers, northern Karnataka may experience severe heat waves. IMD has said that early heatwave conditions have already emerged in parts of Konkan and coastal Karnataka. The state government has advised people to take precautions against heat waves. It should also take steps to address water and power shortages that are bound to happen and prepare its machinery to meet other summer emergencies, including those relating to health. Climate change has made weather phenomena unpredictable and accentuated aberrations, as seen in excessive rain and heat that defy patterns. The government and the people must use the forecast to take on the season with greater preparedness.</p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">India is set for a harsh summer with temperatures expected to soar above normal and heat waves threatening to impact life in many parts of the country.
