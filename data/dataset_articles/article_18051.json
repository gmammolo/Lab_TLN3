  "text": "Winter storm affecting those northwest of the Fox Valley\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Snow conditions are continuing to get worse, especially for those northwest of the Fox Valley.\nJust when you thought spring was finally here with the warmer temperatures last week, Mother Nature said “sike” and gave us another snowstorm.\nIn Shawano, it’s a winter wonderland…in March, and that means not putting the shovels and snowblowers away quite yet.\n“This is my third time I’ve done this already. And I’ll probably be out here another two more times yet,” Bill Scholar of Shawano said.\nPeople are sick of the snow and ready for spring.\n“Well, I want it to go away forever! No more snow! It is affecting our business and we’re done with snow. We want spring,” Annette Lenss of Shawano said.\n“I think I’m ready for spring cause the snow was almost gone and now we got this now again,” Scholar said.\nLenss owns a store in downtown Shawano and she says this weather is not helping her business in the slightest.\n“It’s very slow today. I would be lucky if my Lindaman’s pickup comes in today from Green Bay. It’s that slow,” Lenss said.\nLuckily for Lenss, she didn’t have to worry about a long commute to work, especially with these road conditions.\n“Well, thankfully I live close so it wasn’t too bad but I know it is really slippery out there, even the short distance I had to go,” Lenss said.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.
