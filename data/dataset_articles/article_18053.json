  "text": "Fire crews continue to work on putting out two separate wildfires on the South Side of Bexar County on Wednesday.\nThe fires were boosted by extreme winds on Tuesday, which caused officials to call for mandatory evacuations and the opening of an emergency shelter .\nCounty officials said that more than 50 first responders were still working to put out hotspots on Wednesday evening, though residents were told they could return home on Tuesday evening.\nBoth blazes are about 90% contained as of 4 p.m., according to the Texas A&M Forest Service’s map of active fires .\nThe Calaveras Fire burned 284 acres near I-37 and Southton Road. At least three residential structures including a mobile home, a trailer and a site build structure, were damaged according to city officials on Tuesday.\nThe Duke Fire has impacted 244 acres near Duke and Trumbo roads, with about 40 of those acres in neighboring Atascosa County. According to the Bexar County Public Information Office, six habitable structures have been deemed a total loss.\nDisplaced families are getting help from the county’s Economic and Community Development Office. The county doesn’t have a dollar estimate yet on damage.",
