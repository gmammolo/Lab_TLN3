  "text": "CHELAN COUNTY, Wash.–A rockslide closed State Route 971 South Lakeshore Road on Lake Chelan Monday morning\nWashington State Department of Transportation crews cleared the area at milepost 11, known for its year-round rock issues, before a second rockslide came down later that evening, according to WSDOT. Rocks have continued to cause unresolved issues since Monday with over 1,200 yards of material.\nMaterials include boulders too big to move and exposed rocks on the slope that could fall at any time, according to WSDOT. Crews are working on finding equipment to clear the area.\nThe road between Lake Chelan State Park and the Scenic Ranch Lane intersection will remain closed, with a detour on Navarre Coulee Road, according to WSDOT.",
