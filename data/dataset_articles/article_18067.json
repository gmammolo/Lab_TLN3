  "text": "California\nBidwell Mansion arsonist sentenced to prison and owes millions for Chico blaze\nA Chico man who set fire to what some call the city’s “jewel” received the maximum prison sentence and now owes more than $37.4 million in restitution for destroying the historic Bidwell Mansion.\nButte Superior Court Judge Corie J. Caraway on Wednesday afternoon imposed an 11-year prison sentence for Kevin Alexander Carlson. Last month, Carlson admitted to a felony arson charge that carried a sentencing enhancement for using an accelerator. Carlson was also ordered to pay $37,414,083 in restitution, with 10% interest backdated to Dec. 11, the day of the fire.\nAfter being silent on the details that motivated the crime that shocked the Northern California community, Carlson, 30, described setting the fire as an impulsive act of vandalism in response to what he saw as the disparity between government investing millions of dollars to restore a historic mansion while homeless community members go without help outside of it, according to details of a probation report discussed in court Wednesday.\nIn turn, prosecutors described a “chilling level of premeditation” in setting the blaze that destroyed the iconic Chico landmark, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage and prompting more than 100 impact statements sent to the court describing Carlson’s crime’s emotional impact on community members.\n“The defendant was influenced by his motive and his desire to do something to address his perception of the disparity between classes in our society,” Caraway said. “He also believed that the government seemed to be more concerned with maintaining a mansion that protected the legacy of John Bidwell, who he believed was known to exploit people, while ignoring the less fortunate, such as those who live homeless near the base of the mansion.”",
