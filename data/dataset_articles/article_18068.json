  "text": "1 2 Jaipur: Water resources minister Suresh Singh Rawat acknowledged in the state Assembly that polluted water from Ludhiana was being discharged into the Sutlej River, which eventually flows into Rajasthan through the Indira Gandhi Canal, Sirhind Feeder, and Bikaner Canal, but he assured that before reaching households in Rajasthan, including in Sriganganagar, the water undergoes a filtration and treatment process.\n\"A total of 313 rural and seven urban drinking water projects in the district use sedimentation tanks, slow sand filters, and rapid gravity filters. Further, chlorination is done using chlorine gas and bleaching powder to make the water bacteria-free before distribution,\" said Rawat.\nIn response to a written question from Congress MLA Rupinder Singh Kooner on the issue of residents of Sriganganagar consuming polluted water, Rawat said 57 sewage treatment plants (STPs) had been constructed in the Sutlej River's catchment area to address pollution, and they were being continuously monitored.\nKooner raised concerns about the health hazards caused by polluted water, including skin diseases, renal failure, and cancer in Sriganganagar district. Rawat said the govt was aware of the issue and was in communication with its counterparts in Punjab.\n\"Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) was informed about the major sources of pollution, and directives were issued to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and ensure their full utilisation. Strict measures have also been taken to prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the Sutlej River,\" Rawat said.\nRawat informed the House that \"A Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring System has been installed at RD 368.50 on the Bikaner Canal at the Rajasthan-Punjab border. This system continuously tracks critical water parameters such as pH levels, turbidity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chlorides.\"\nStay updated with breaking news , weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
