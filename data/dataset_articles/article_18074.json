  "text": "Several goats, pigs perish in Door County barn fire\nBRUSSELS, Wis. (WBAY) - Several animals, including five goats and six pigs, perished in a barn fire in Brussels on Tuesday evening.\nThe Brussels-Union-Gardner (BUG) Fire Department responded around 4:48 p.m. Tuesday for a structure fire on Star Road. Calls to 911 indicated a barn was fully engulfed with animals still inside.\nWhen crews arrived on scene, the department said they found the west end of the barn was fully engulfed with smoke pouring out the entire structure. A home was approximately 50 feet from the barn. Property owners were on scene trying to get animals out of the barn.\nFirst responders were able to rescue some full size pigs and three piglets from the east end of the barn before the barn became fully engulfed from one end to the other. Firefighters were also able to rescue approximately 30 chickens and secured them in another structure on site.\nCrews were able to knock down the flames in around 30 to 40 minutes.\nDue to a metal roof collapsing during fire suppression efforts, the department said an excavator responded to the scene to remove the metal roof so firefighters could fully extinguish the flames.\nThe department said the fire appeared to have started on the west end of the barn, where the property owners said they had two heat lamps used to keep baby goats warm.\nThe property owner did not have insurance on the barn, which was built in 1940 and was approximately 100 feet by 40 feet in size. The home sustained heat damage to the exterior vinyl siding.\nFive goats and six pigs were among the several animals who perished in the fire, according to the department. The cause of the fire is undetermined at this time, but given initial information and first on scene reports, the department said the fire does not appear to be suspicious.\nTwo water supply fill sites were set up at BUG Fire Station 1 located on County C. BUG Fire responded with 10 units and 29 Firefighters. The incident was cleared at 9:01 pm.\nThe following agencies assisted: Fire Departments of Southern Door, Nasewaupee, Sturgeon Bay, Casco, New Franken, Algoma, Jacksonport, Kewaunee, Sister Bay Liberty Grove, Egg Harbor, Tisch Mills, Denmark, Carlton and Luxemburg. Also assisting were Door County EMS, Door County Sheriff’s Office, Wisconsin Public Service and Door County 911 Communications Center.\n“We extend our heartfelt thoughts to the property owners for their loss,” the department said in a statement.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY.
