This order was imposed by the Finance Ministry in relation to alleged losses incurred through fraudulent government-to-government (G-to-G) rice contracts—a controversy that has entangled Yingluck in legal battles since 2017. Prawit Boothiam, who serves as a vice president of the court, confirmed that significant headway has been made on the case, which has been actively under the court's consideration since 2021. Prawit expressed optimism about reaching a conclusion before the year ends. The contentious issue began with a 2017 Supreme Court ruling, which sentenced Yingluck to five years in prison, in absentia, for her alleged mismanagement of the rice subsidy scheme. Nevertheless, she had already left Thailand, contending that the military government, which ousted her in 2014, would treat her unfairly. In the wake of the sentencing, the Ministry of Finance mandated a hefty 35 billion baht compensation from Yingluck for the purported financial damages linked to the G-to-G rice deals. Yingluck countered this directive by filing an appeal with the Central Administrative Court, which ruled in her favour in 2021. The court's decision invalidated the Finance Ministry's compensation demand on grounds that the responsibility for the scheme did not rest solely with her, but also involved the Cabinet and the National Rice Policy Committee. The Central Administrative Court acknowledged that while Yingluck was aware of the G-to-G rice contracts, there was no concrete evidence to suggest she was informed about the corrupt practices linked to the sale of rice under those contracts. Unperturbed, the Finance Ministry proceeded to challenge this ruling, escalating the matter to the Supreme Administrative Court, which has since been meticulously examining the case. The upcoming verdict is highly anticipated, not least because it will cap off years of legal wrangling and speculation about Yingluck’s accountability and involvement in the high-profile rice pledging scheme. As the verdict draws near, it represents not just the denouement of Yingluck’s long-standing legal saga but also a significant moment in the legal interpretation of ministerial accountability and executive responsibility within Thai politics, reported The Nation. -- 2025-03-06\n-\n-\nPopular in The Pub\n-",
