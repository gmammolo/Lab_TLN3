  "text": "GB NEWS\nThe former Brexit Party leader criticised the committee for 'telling us to stop eating so much meat'\nTrending on GB News\nNigel Farage has launched a scathing attack on the Climate Change Committee's latest recommendations during his GB News programme.\nThe former Brexit Party leader criticised the committee for \"telling us to stop eating so much meat\".\nHe also took aim at their advice against foreign holidays and their promotion of \"very, very expensive heat pumps\".\nNigel claimed this marks \"the first time ever\" the committee has acknowledged the \"gigantic cost\" to Britain of pursuing Net Zero policies.\nNigel Farage hit out at climate change measures\nGB NEWS\nHis comments come amid growing debate about the economic impact of climate policies on British industry and households.\nNigel suggested the cost of Net Zero could range from \"£100 billion to £300 billion\" with the final figure being \"of an enormous magnitude\".\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nNigel Farage clashed with Donnachadh McCarthy on the matter\nGB NEWS\nHe warned that while \"some jobs are being created in renewable energy\", a far greater number are \"being lost in manufacturing\".\n\"There is an industrial massacre going on in our country now,\" he told viewers.\nHis comments highlight growing concerns about the economic trade-offs of rapid decarbonisation.\nFarage questioned whether Britain can afford such policies at a time when \"the world situation is probably the most dangerous since we've been alive\".\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband is spearheading Britain's net zero push\nParliament.tvHe suggested the UK needs to reconsider its climate commitments given the current global context.\nFarage expressed particular concern for the automotive industry, claiming \"no one wants electric vehicles\".\n\"There's a million jobs in the car industry; if we stick to these EV targets all these one million jobs could be gone,\" he warned.\nHe pointed to January being \"the lowest manufacturing month since 1954\" as evidence of decline.\nThe GB News star questioned specific factory closures, asking: \"Why is Luton closing? Why is Cowley about to stop producing the Mini, having been there since before the First World War?\"\nHis comments reflect growing anxiety about the future of British car manufacturing amid the transition to electric vehicles.\nNigel argued that defence spending should be prioritised over climate initiatives in the current geopolitical climate.\n\"We need money for defence. We all know that. It's absolutely vital,\" he stated.\nHe suggested Britain could make a meaningful difference through defence spending as \"that linchpin in NATO between America and Europe\".\nIn contrast, he dismissed the impact of UK climate policies on global environmental outcomes.\n\"Can we, with spending on net zero, make a difference to the global environment? And the answer is no,\" Farage claimed.\nHe emphasised that Britain produces \"less than one per cent of global carbon dioxide\" and therefore \"cannot make a difference to the global climate\".",
