  "text": "On Wednesday at 6:24 p.m. the National Weather Service issued a flood advisory in effect until 9:30 p.m. for Dutchess and Ulster counties.\nThe weather service says, \"Urban and small stream flooding caused by excessive rainfall is expected.\"\n\"Minor flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas. Water over roadways. Overflowing poor drainage areas,\" explains the weather service. \"Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the dangers of flooding. Be aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.\"\nUnderstanding the differences between advisories, watches, and warnings\n- Flash flood warning: Take action!\nA flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring. If you are in a flood-prone area, move immediately to high ground. A flash flood is a sudden violent flood that can take from minutes to hours to develop. It is even possible to experience a flash flood in areas not immediately receiving rain.\n- Flood warning: Take action!\nA flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.\n- Flood advisory: Be aware:\nA flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.\n- Flood watch: Be prepared:\nA flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It does not mean flooding will occur, but it is possible.\nKeeping safe during floods: Expert advice from the weather service\nIn flood-prone regions or while camping in low-lying areas, understanding and following the weather service flood safety guidelines can be a lifesaver:\nSeek higher ground:\nIf you're in a flood-prone area, or if you're camping in a low-lying spot, move to higher ground as a first step.\nFollow evacuation orders:\nWhen local authorities issue an evacuation order, promptly comply. Before leaving, secure your home by locking it.\nDisconnect utilities and appliances:\nIf time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.\nAvoid basements and submerged areas:\nSteer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.\nSwift evacuation for your safety:\nIf you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping sounds, evacuate without delay. Do not enter water that may carry an electrical charge.\nRefrain from walking in floodwaters:\nNever attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.\nSeek high ground if trapped:\nIn the event you become trapped by moving water, make your way to the highest point available and contact emergency services by calling 911.\nDuring heavy rainfall, the risk of flooding is heightened, especially in low-lying and flood-prone regions. Always remember never to drive through water on the road, no matter how shallow it appears. According to the weather service, as little as 12 inches of rapidly flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Stay safe by being prepared and informed.\nRainy roadways ahead: Essential safety tips for heavy rain\nWhen heavy rain pours, the risk of flooding and treacherous roads rises. Here's your guide from the weather service to staying safe during downpours:\nBeware of rapid water flow:\nIn heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.\nMaintain safe driving distances:\nUse the two-second rule to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you and allow an extra two seconds in heavy rain.\nSlow down and drive with care:\nOn wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.\nChoose your lane wisely:\nStay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes.\nVisibility matters:\nEnhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.\nWatch out for slippery roads:\nBe extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery.\nKeep a safe distance from large vehicles:\nLarge trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely.\nMind your windshield wipers:\n- Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots.\n- When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.\nBy following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.\nAdvance Local Weather Alerts is a service provided by United Robots, which uses machine learning to compile the latest data from the National Weather Service.",
