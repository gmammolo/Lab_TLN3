  "text": "Whether it’s plastic bottles or cups near waterways, smashed cans scattered in the grass, or plastic bags caught in the branches of a bush or tree — Litter is everywhere this time of year. Throughout the winter, snow may have covered up the litter, but now, you’ll find it everywhere. “People see green grass and they think that this is a great time to get out of their houses to pick up the sticks and branches in their own backyards. But as you drive around the melting snow reveals a whole variety of other issues that are happening out there,” said Don Benczkowski, program coordinator for the Lake Erie region of Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful. Most litter is the direct result of human activity, and shows off how much waste we produce through “one-time-use” items, like fast food wrappers, cups bottles, straws and cigarette butts. It finds its way to a sidewalk or yard near you after someone disposes of it incorrectly, and the wind or rain carries it sometimes miles away from where it was dropped. “Trash is coming in from all over the place. It’s not necessarily ours. During one of the first coastal cleanup events that I coordinated, we had a garbage can that came from Cleveland Metroparks. We picked that up in Springfield Township,” said Benczkowski. While the City of Erie and surrounding municipalities collect your trash that is put out on collection day, oftentimes, they’re not the ones picking loose items up by hand. It’s why those with Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful are advocating for you to get involved. If you see something, pick it up, and don’t rely on others to do it for you. “It’s a very transitional time of year but from that standpoint, it’s good to notice that,” said Benczkowski. “We live in a community that borders 20% of the world’s fresh water supply. So if there’s a place that needs to be protected, that needs special consideration, it’s right here.” Keep Pennsylvania Beautiful supports roughly 75,000 volunteers statewide who help to keep things clean. On average, they remove more than 7 million pounds of trash from roads, waterways, parks and shared public spaces.
