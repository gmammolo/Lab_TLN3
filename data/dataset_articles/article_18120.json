  "text": "Oil-rich Alberta \"would love\" to increase energy exports to the US, but an ongoing trade war sparked by US president Donald Trump is forcing the Canadian province to pump the brakes on more cross-border pipeline projects and instead look in other directions.\n\"Until our US friends come back to reality, we will focus on efforts and financial means to export one of the largest oil and gas deposits in the world elsewhere,\" Alberta premier Danielle Smith said on Wednesday. The province will turn to Canada's west, east and north coasts \"to build multiple oil and gas pipelines\" to target markets in Asia and Europe, she said.\nTrump imposed a 10pc tariff on energy and a 25pc tariff on non-energy imports from Canada starting on 4 March, which Smith says are \"unjustified and a clear breach\" of the US-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement.\nSmith is privy to Alberta-US pipeline proposals which she says could increase Canadian crude exports to the US, now at about 4mn b/d, by 50pc.\n\"With the combination of proposals I've seen, we could potentially see an increase of 2mn b/d or more by 2030,\" Smith said. \"We in Alberta would love to increase the amount of oil and gas we send to our southern neighbours.\"\nSmith said she is \"readying\" a proposal to present to the US administration but she said those conversations can't happen with tariffs in place. In the meantime, Trump's action has sparked a debate within Canada about diversifying trade, providing some new tailwinds for industry seeking more market access.\nPipeline sentiment changing, obstacles remain\n\"From our perspective, we're hearing all the right things and now we need to start to see all the right things,\" pipeline operator Pembina's chief executive Scott Burrows said on 28 February.\n\"I just saw a new proposal for either a Northern Gateway 2.0, or a spur line coming off of the Trans Mountain pipeline,\" said Smith.\nBuilding pipelines in Canada is no easy feat with burdensome regulations that have seen proposals either cancelled by the federal government or abandoned by project developers. To consider advancing major projects like Northern Gateway, for example, Enbridge said in February it would need legislative change and the legal certainties the project could be finished.\n\"It's time to start building pipe, developing resources and constructing ports on every coast without further delay,\" Smith said on Wednesday, but added it will require a \"significant attitude adjustment\" from fellow Canadian political leaders to make it happen.\nSmith made the comments at a press conference highlighting new security measures for its portion of the US-Canada border. Trump has justified the tariffs by suggesting both Canada and Mexico need to enhance border security, but other Canadian politicians increasingly doubt the two are related as efforts to beef up the border have seemingly gone unnoticed by the US.\nTrump's legal rationale for the tariffs, cutting the cross-border flow of fentanyl into the US, is \"completely bogus,\" prime minister Justin Trudeau said on 4 March. \"The one thing he has said repeatedly is that he wants to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because [Trump thinks] that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
