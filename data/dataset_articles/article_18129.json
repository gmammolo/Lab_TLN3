  "text": "Weather News\nThunderstorms with damaging winds in Santa Clara County Wednesday\nThe creation of this content included the use of AI based on templates created, reviewed and edited by journalists in the newsroom. Read more on our AI policy here.\nThe NWS San Francisco CA issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 2:31 p.m. on Wednesday in effect until 3 p.m. for Santa Clara County.\nResidents should prepare for wind gusts of up to 60 mph.\n\"At 2:31 p.m., a severe thunderstorm was located near Gilroy, moving southeast at 10 mph,\" states the NWS. \"Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.\"\nThe warning is for Gilroy, Morgan Hill and San Martin.\nThe NWS adds, \"Tornadoes can develop quickly from severe thunderstorms. Seek shelter immediately in an interior room on the lowest floor of a well-built structure. Report severe weather to your nearest law enforcement agency or the National Weather Service office in San Francisco CA.\"\nThis warning is in effect until 3 p.m.\nHow to react when facing a lightning hazard?\nLightning strikes the United States about 25 million times a year. Most of the strikes occur in the summer, killing 20 people each year, according to the NWS. Chance of lightning increases as a thunderstorm approaches and peaks when the storm is overhead. It diminishes as the storm moves away.\nHere are recommendations for maintaining safety during a thunderstorm:\n- To minimize risk of being struck by lightning, when going outside, have a plan to get to a safer place.\n- If the sky becomes menacing and thunder becomes audible, seek out a safe place to seek shelter.\n- Once indoors, avoid touching corded phones, electrical equipment, plumbing, and windows and doors.\n- Wait 30 minutes after the last lightning or thunder before going back outside.\nIf finding indoor shelter is not an option:\n- Avoid open fields, hill peaks, or ridge tops.\n- Avoid tall, isolated trees or other elevated objects. If you are in a forest, stick to areas with shorter tree cover.\n- When in a group, space out to prevent the current from transferring between individuals.\n- If you are camping in an open area, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low area. Remember, a tent offers no protection from lighting.\n- Maintain a safe distance from water, wet items, and metal objects. Water and metal do not attract lightning, yet they conduct electricity efficiently.\nRainy weather driving tips\n- Switch on headlights - Even during daylight hours, using headlights can enhance visibility and signal your presence to other drivers.\n- While on the road - Opt for the middle lanes and remain on higher ground. Rainwater tends to gather along the road edges.\n- Keep clear of puddles - Driving through puddles or low rainwater areas can cause vehicles to hydroplane or skid out of control\n- Maintain a safe distance from large vehicles - Trucks or buses can produce a water spray that hampers visibility.\n- Avoid flooded zones - If you encounter a flooded road, make a U-turn and go back. The powerful currents of flash floods can carry drivers off the road. Driving through deep water can also damage a vehicle's mechanical and electrical systems.\nWhat is hydroplaning?\nHydroplaning is when a vehicle starts uncontrollably sliding on wet roads.\nThis happens when water in front of the tire builds up faster than the vehicle's weight can push water out of the way. The water pressure then causes the vehicle to rise and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road, making the driver lose control. The top three contributors to hydroplaning are:\n- Vehicle speed - When a vehicle's speed increases, the tire-traction grip and ability to control the vehicle decreases. Drive at a reduced speed during wet weather.\n- Water depth - The deeper the water, the sooner a vehicle loses traction on the road. It doesn't matter how deep the water is, even a thin layer can lead to hydroplaning.\n- Tire tread depth - Checking your tire tread before hitting the road is important, as low or no tread can lead to sliding.\nIn the event of your vehicle hydroplaning, here's what to know:\n- Ease off the accelerator - Step off the gas to slow down the vehicle until the tires find traction.\n- Turn into the skid - Turning into the skid can help the vehicle's tires realign to regain control.\n- Make sure the tires reconnect with the road - During the skid, wait until the tires reconnect with the road and then gently straighten the wheels to regain control.\n- Brake gently as needed - Brake normally if the vehicle has anti-lock brakes and pump brakes gently if in an older vehicle.\nSource: The National Weather Service\nThis story was originally published March 5, 2025 at 2:37 PM.",
