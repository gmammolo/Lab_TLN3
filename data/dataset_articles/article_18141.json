  "text": "|\nAs thunderstorms and high winds rocked Granville County this week, local officials also noted a storm of a different kind — a rash of wildfires that has been burning woodlands and grasslands in the area and across much of the state.\nIn a message to Granville County officials Tuesday, Rob Montague, Granville/Vance County ranger with the N.C. Forest Service, noted that over the past seven days county fire departments and the N.C. Forest Service hadresponded to 14 wildland fires.\nAt Montague’s urging, the county forwarded to local media outlets a press release from the N.C. Forest Service that asked residents “to be diligent about using best practices and common sense with all outdoor fires, especially yard debris burns.”\nN.C. Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler called on everyone to work together in preventing fires.\n“We reduce our wildfire risk by working together,” Troxler said. “When it comes to wildfire response this time of year, the N.C. Forest Service is at the ready, prepositioning resources as needed. We need you to be prepared and ready for wildfire.Understand that you’re not powerless when it comes to wildfire prevention and risk reduction. Everyone has a role to play, starting with making good decisions and planning ahead if you intend to start a fire.”\nThe leading cause of wildfires statewide is escaped yard debris burns, according to the press release.\nThe N.C. Forest Service attributes the cause of 99% of wildfirew to human activity — including the use of burning as a method to dispose of leaves, limbs and other yard debris.\n“Careless behaviors, such as burning on the wrong day, leaving a fire unattended, not\nstaying with a fire until it is fully extinguished, can result in a fire escaping and becoming a\ndangerous wildfire that quickly threatens lives and property,” said N.C. Forest Service Assistant Commissioner and State Forester Greg Hicks. “Your N.C. Forest Service county ranger is a great resource for recommending best practices and guidance about when, where and how to burn safely outdoors.”\nBefore starting an outdoor fire, contact your local NCFS county ranger’s office.\nThe N.C. Forest Service also offers the following tips:\n• Check local burning laws. Some communities allow burning only during specified hours. Others forbid it entirely.\n• Make sure you have a valid permit. You can obtain a burn permit at any N.C. Forest Service office or authorized permitting agent, or online at www.ncforestservice.gov/burnpermit.\n• Keep an eye on the weather. Don’t burn on dry, windy days.\n• Local fire officials can recommend a safe way to burn debris. Don’t pile vegetation on the ground. Instead, place it in a cleared area and contain it in a screened receptacle away from overhead branches and wires.\n• Be sure you are fully prepared before burning. To control the fire, you will need a hose, bucket, steel rake and a shovel for tossing dirt on the fire. Keep a phone nearby, too.\n• Never use kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel or other flammable liquids to speed up debris burning.\n• Stay with your fire until it is completely out.\nThese same tips apply to campfires and grills as well.\nIn addition, the N.C. Forest Service asks that you follow these practices:\n• Douse burning charcoal briquettes or campfires thoroughly with water. Drown all embers, not just the red ones.\n• When coals are soaked, stir the coals and soak them again. Make sure everything is wet and that embers are cold to the touch.\n• If you do not have water, mix enough dirt or sand with the embers to extinguish the fire, being careful not to bury the fire.\n• Never dump hot ashes or coals into a wooded area.\nTo learn more about fire safety and preventing wildfires and loss of property, refer to /www.ncagr.gov/divisions/nc-forest-service/fire-control-and-prevention/fire-safety-outdoors.\nFor information about creating defensible space and a fire-resistant landscape around your home and property, visit www.resistwildfirenc.org.\nMontague may be reached at Granville.ncfs@ncagr.gov.",
