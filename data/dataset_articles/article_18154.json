  "text": "2 tornadoes cause damage around Louisiana\nBATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - This morning people in Darrow and Gramercy are picking up what’s left following tornadoes that swept up parts of homes and fences.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, in Gramercy wind speeds clocked in upwards of 75 miles per hour.\nIn Darrow, wind speeds hit 90 miles per hour during an EF-1 tornado that some residents said sounded like a freight train.\n“It seemed like seconds,” said Ashley Lyon, a resident of Darrow.\nLyon tells WAFB she was getting her kids ready for bed when suddenly, the tornado hit.\n“I just heard uh, it’s indescribable the sound,” said Lyon, while holding back tears. “And our front door broke. So, I turned to our kids, and I said, get in the bathroom!”\nThe twister was already passing over the house.\n“Before we could get to the bathroom this window here busted out,” said Lyon. “And my little girl got a little cut on her eye from it but other than that we made it in the bathroom, and we were fine.”\nLater, fire crews rushed out to take care of those impacted by the twister.\n“Everybody came ready to work, everybody had tools in their hand,” said St. Amant fire chief, James LeBlanc. “It was just impressive to see the amount of people that I saw last night never hesitate to jump on one of these roofs and start putting the tarps on and it’s just very impressive.”\nWhen the dust settled not one person - or animal - suffered a severe injury, including the Lyon family’s chickens setup out in the backyard about 100 yards from the house missing parts of its roof.\n“The chickens survived actually,” said Lyon. “Everything is perfect with the chickens.”\nClick here to report a typo.
