  "text": "More cases of Japanese encephalitis virus have been detected in Queensland piggeries, with nearly one-third of the state's facilities thought to be infected.\nHowever, industry leaders are optimistic a vaccine developed in Queensland to protect animals from the zoonotic disease that can cause reproductive issues in pigs will be approved for use in Australia soon.\nBiosecurity Queensland revealed on March 5 that the disease, spread from the bite of an infected mosquito, continued to be detected at piggeries across the state.\nIt indicated that JEV was established in mainland Australia, with the transmission risks likely to vary seasonally and between years depending on weather and other local factors, and transmitted to humans and pigs by mosquitoes and has been identified in agricultural regions with significant water sources or after rainfall events.\nAustralian Pork Limited CEO Margo Andrae said with the anticipated rain from Tropical Cyclone Alfred to fall across the state's south east, pork graziers needed to be alert, even in areas with no previous JEV detections.\n\"JEV is fairly widespread in SEQ,\" Ms Andrae said.\n\"Between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of piggeries are estimated to be infected, so we ask people on farms to remain vigilant and protect animals and staff during this cyclone.\n\"The key issue with JEV is the bad guy here is the mosquito,\"\nHowever, Ms Andrae said JEV did not impact the meat's taste.\n\"Pork is completely safe to eat,\" she said.\n\"People can still enjoy delicious Queensland pork.\"\nHopefully, a new animal vaccine will shortly be available, Ms Andrae said.\n\"While there's no vaccine for pigs here at this stage, we have been working with the University of Queensland and several regulars, including the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority,\" she said.\n\"We have been working with regulators such as the APVMA, and it is pretty close to being available.\n\"We are also exploring international animal vaccines and are investigating if it would be easier and quicker to bring these in; Japan, not surprisingly, has a good vaccine, so we are exploring global options.\"\nMs Andrae said the state's pork industry had been working closely with Queensland Health to make it easier for people to access the free human JEV vaccine.\nSunPork Group CEO and managing director Dr Robert van Barneveld said he felt that, as the producer of 20 per cent of Australia's pork and the country's largest single supplier, the company was well prepared for the latest round of JEV.\n\"At the moment, any production impacts are yet to be ascertained, but it does not seem extensive,\" Mr van Barneveld said.\n\"This is our second wave of JEV after it was found here three years ago.\n\"Now JEV is endemic to the east coast of Australia and is still a notifiable emergency animal disease because of the impact on humans.\"\nMr van Barneveld said some pigs appeared to develop a limited resistance to JEV.\n\"Once a sow and gilets are exposed, there seems to be a level of passive immunity in some animals,\" he said.\n\"The infected mosquito has to bite the female pig at a certain stage of her gestation to affect her gilts, so it's a window in a window.\"\nA Biosecurity Queensland spokesperson said people couldn't catch JEV directly from infected animals.\nJEV cannot be transmitted human-to-human or human-to-mosquito.\n\"If you suspect an animal is showing signs of JEV, you must report it to your local veterinarian or BQ on 13 25 23,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"If your veterinarian believes your animals may have JEV, they will take samples and submit them for testing at a government laboratory.\"\nJEV can also cause neurological signs in horses (incoordination, difficulty swallowing, impaired vision), so all pig and horse owners should be alert to this virus.",
