  "text": "GEORGETOWN (KXAN)— Homes throughout Central Texas — many which are newer builds —have sustained roof damage after Tuesday’s high winds. Now neighbors want to know why their homes aren’t able to withstand more. KXAN received reports from Georgetown, Betram, Hutto, Uhland and other areas. Neighbors asked us to look into homes built by the same developer that are dealing with repeated roof damage issues. On Wednesday KXAN connected with a group of neighbors in the Fairhaven neighborhood in Georgetown. D.R. Horton is the developer of this neighborhood. In a statement, Scott Wilburn, Division President for D.R. Horton’s Austin Division told us: “D.R. Horton is aware of the concerns raised by some homeowners regarding the performance of roof shingles during the recent high winds experienced in Austin and surrounding areas. We are currently investigating the matter and involving the two shingle manufacturers represented in the community. D.R. Horton takes home quality seriously and is committed to meeting the highest standards of craftsmanship and durability from our homes.” It went on to say any concerned homeowners should contact them at 512-345-4663 or visit their website to submit an online warranty request. It did add, however, damages caused by extreme weather is not typically covered by their builder warranty.” Neighbors reported more than half of the homes now have torn up shingles that were ripped off by wind on Tuesday. Most homeowners in Fairhaven who KXAN spoke with said they have lived in their new builds less than five years. “This poor quality is unacceptable,” neighbor Amanda Brown said. As neighbors listened to each others’ roof damage experiences in their short period of time living in the neighborhood, frustrations grew. “I bought this house brand new, thinking I’m getting into a new home, there’s not going to be an issue,” neighbor Bhavin Mistry said. “I feel like I’m being robbed.” Forty to 60 mph hour winds on Tuesday left some neighbors feeling unsafe. “Shingles were flying all over the backyard, the front yard,” neighbor Ken Liu said. “My kids couldn’t go outside.” Neighbor Devanshi Sukhadi said she questioned if she could sleep upstairs in her room, due to how bad things got with the wind ripping shingles off her family’s roof. “All the banging we were hearing,” Sukhadi said. Neighbors want answers about the quality of the materials used. “We have some neighboring communities, their house is way older than what we have,” neighbor Neel Parikh said. “It’s a different builder…they have not faced [roof damage issues],” Parikh said. Neighbor Cherly Bouillon said she’s had to call out three roofing companies in five years. “I’ve been told by several roofers that the shingles are subpar,” Bouillon said. Ripple Roofing & Construction surveyed some damage Wednesday. Its company didn’t install the roofs in Fairhaven. However, the company’s co-owner, Tyler Griffiths, said he isn’t surprised most of these homes were impacted. “These three tabs are all single laminated, so they’re not as heavy,” Griffiths said. “They’re not going to hold up to wind, or hail…As far as trying to blame workmanship or trying to figure out exactly what’s going on, it’s kind of tough to say.” Neighbors just want someone to be held accountable. “All these roofs need to just be redone,” Brown said. “At no expense to the homeowners.” IKO is the company that made the shingles used for the roofs in the Fairhaven neighborhood. A spokesperson for the company said concerned neighbors should file a claim with IKO. IKO said, per an industry standard, homeowners would be required to send ripped off shingles to its company to determine if there’s a product issue. IKO add that customers would be responsible for paying for shipping. D&H Roofing said it installed the roofs in the Fairhaven neighborhood. It told KXAN other homes its works on using different materials than IKO haven’t had damage issues. This is an ongoing investigation. Reach out to Reporter Jala Washington with on-going concerns.
