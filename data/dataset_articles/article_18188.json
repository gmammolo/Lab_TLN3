  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Tx — Happy Wednesday!\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n- Fire danger continues tomorrow as winds pick up again\n- Air quality has improved but will still be hazardous for sensitive groups\nWind speeds have thankfully calmed down but humidity in the area is still low. Fire danger concern has decreased but we're not out of the woods just yet, as winds will pick up once again tomorrow. So neighborhoods throughout the Coastal Bend will be under a mixture of high and very high fire danger risk.\nAs moisture gradually rebounds late Thursday and into Friday from southeasterly winds, afternoon high temps will return to the 80s and fire danger concerns will drop into the moderate zone for Friday.\nThis will be short lived as another dry cold front will move through the Coastal Bend this weekend, reissuing dangerously dry weather conditions and strong winds, potentially bringing critical fire risk back into the forecast.\nCORPUS CHRISTI FORECAST\nTonight: A few clouds\nTemperature: Low 52ºF\nWinds: ESE 5-10 mph\nThursday: Partly cloudy, breezy\nTemperature: High 80ºF\nWinds: SE 10-20 mph, gusts to 30 mph\nThursday Night: Partly cloudy and lighter winds\nTemperature: Low 62ºF\nWinds: SSE 10-15 mph\nHave a good evening!",
