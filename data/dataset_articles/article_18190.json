(WIS) - Residents across the Midlands are reacting to the damage done following Wednesday morning storms.\nFairfield County has seen some damage from severe weather.\nWIS News 10 spoke with a gas station in Ridgeway, one who said a new roof flew off the building into the ground.\nVictor Sherman said the new roof was about three to four years old.\n“This happened around 8’o’clock. I was inside the store, I just heard one ‘boom!’” Sherman said.\nSherman said he was inside his business when the roof blew off.\n“As soon as I go on that side, I see the whole roof was down,” Sherman.\nAfter losing his roof, heavy rain got in and damaged the business' ceiling tiles and insulation.\nSherman said he is facing the possibility of closing up shop for a few days if he wants it to get fixed before the next time it rains.\n“It’s really going to hurt. Lease is going to be the same, bills are going to be the same. We’re going to have to shut down for a couple of days. It’s Mother Nature. You can’t fight with that,” Sherman said.\nThroughout the county residents were woken up by the sound of strong winds and heavy rain.\n“I mean I didn’t clock it but still it was ferocious,” said Gena McCoy\nThe winds in the county were gusting to about 40 miles per hour.\nAccording to the National Weather Service, this was likely caused by straight line winds. And says they’ve had no other reports of damage in the county.\nFeel more informed, prepared, and connected with WIS.
