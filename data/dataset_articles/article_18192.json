(KCTV) - Many are still feeling the impacts from the storm that swept across the Kansas City metro late Tuesday.\nCrews and residents got a better look at the damage Wednesday morning after high winds and snow.\n“The wind was crazy,” said Victoria Shelton, who lives in Lenexa.\nShelton and her family couldn’t open their front door. Wind gusts completely uprooted the tree in their front yard, blocking them in.\n“Around like 2, 3 a.m. I heard a loud boom, and it startled me out of bed,” she said, “when I woke up this morning and saw it, I was kind of shocked.”\nEvergy crews were out fixing power lines, as nearly 190,000 residents were without power after the storm.\nMeanwhile, tree removal crews wasted no time cutting through the mess as calls continued to come in throughout the morning.\n“With all the saturation with the rain that we had yesterday, leaving to this red wood here, there was a root system that was failing,” said Will Garner, with Timber Tree Service LLC, “not to mention all the high winds and all there was a lot of wait from this wet snow that basically caused it to tip over and up root.”\nAcross town in Overland Park a large tree snapped, falling over onto a powerline, causing a house fire.\nIn Overland Park a large tree snapped, falling over onto a powerline, causing a house fire. (KCTV5) “The wind was blowing straight out of the north, blowing this way and it just literally snapped it off about 6-8 foot up and its laying across my fence,” said Mike Hyde.\nHyde said his neighbor’s home, that belongs to an elderly woman in her mid-90′s was inside.\nHe said smoke was coming from her garage and wasn’t able to walk, so the neighbor across the street ran in to save her.\n“Her smoke alarm went off, but she had no power she was disoriented in her house, he said, “Andy went in quickly, got her, carried her over to his house across the street.”\nHyde explained it was a freighting situation and happened all so quick, but is just glad everyone is okay and pushes everyone to check their trees.\n“It snapped it off like a twig, so yeah that’s probably a good thing, if you think you got trees that are damaged, I would definitely probably look to have them cut down or trimmed up,” he said.”\nCopyright 2025 KCTV.
