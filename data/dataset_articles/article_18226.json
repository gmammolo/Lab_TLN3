  "text": "Mango lovers are in for some disappointment. The king of fruits is likely to make a late entry this year. Additionally, the production is predicted to be lower because of the flowering pattern this year. According to experts, despite there being full flowering on the trees, the fruiting will be much less.\nExplaining the reason for lower crop production, Vijaysinh Barot, horticulture officer, Centre of Excellence for Agriculture, Talala, says, “During the flowering period between December 15 and January 15, temperature should be around 25 degrees Celsius during the day and 15+ degrees at night.\nHowever, this year the temperature in regions where Kesar mangoes grow was lower than required. As a result, the ratio between the male and the female flowers on the trees has been disturbed and there has been more male flowering.” Since it is the female flowers that bear fruit, the final production will be quite less, he explains.\n10-15% rise in prices\nDue to lower production, mangoes are expected to be costlier when they hit the market. Ramesh Siroya, secretary of Talala Marketing Yard, says, “This will be the second consecutive bad season for Kesar mangoes. Last year, we received 5.5 lakh boxes (of 10 kg each) of mangoes at the marketing yard for selling. This year doesn’t look any better. In 2023, we had sold 11 lakh boxes. The bad crop of mangoes is thanks to the weather.” He expects 10-15% price rise due to higher demand, pointing out that the main mango season will be in May.\nAhmedabad-based entrepreneur Dhara Kapadia who sells high-quality mangoes to premium clientele, says, “This year, season will be delayed by two to three weeks. It is expected to start from the first or second week of April. There might be a minor rise in prices, but retailers like us may try to absorb the hike partially at their end.”\nGirish Bhimani, who has over 100 trees of Kesar mangoes in his farm in Junagadh’s Vanthali, predicts prices to start at Rs 1,500 for a 10-kg box initially and then lower down to Rs 1,000–1,200 for a while before stabilising at Rs 700–800 later during the peak season.\nWeather not the only factor\nThe impact of external factors is visible on the fruit. “Apart from the weather, polluted groundwater in our region is also spoiling the crop. The Uben river that passes through Jetpur receives a lot of chemical waste. Due to this, groundwater is polluted up to 5 km on both sides of the passing river,” says Bhimani.\nHowever, Not all are unhappy with the crop this year. Bhuj-based Haresh Thakkar who has done mango farming over 80 acres of land, is optimistic about the availability of mangoes. “Areas like Bhachau and Mandvi have had good mango flowering,” he says, adding, “However, the full picture will be clear by March 20. Retail prices of mangoes are expected to start at Rs 300–400 per kg and slowly come down to around Rs 70–80.” Traditionally, mangoes from Bhuj arrive later than others in the market.\n Areas like Bhachau, Mandvi have had good mango flowering... However, the full picture will be clear by March 20. Retail prices of mangoes are expected to start at Rs 300–400 per kg and slowly come down toaround Rs 70–80 –Haresh Thakkar",
