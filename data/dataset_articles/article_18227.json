  "text": "With incoming thunderstorms Tuesday night, the National Weather Service issued a severe weather advisory anticipating damaging wind gusts. According to meteorologist Brett Albright, a line of storms will move through Georgia late Tuesday through Wednesday morning, bringing strong winds which could knock down trees across the county. For Cobb, the storm will be strongest between 12 a.m. and 4 a.m. Wednesday with wind gusts reaching between 30 and 40 mph. \"The main hazard is going to be straight line wind gusts,\" Albright said. \"The other thing to note is that it's going to be pretty breezy even before the thunderstorms get in ... We're going to see winds that may knock down a few isolated trees in the area.\" Albright said peak wind gusts as high as 60 mph are also possible for areas throughout Cobb. With these strong winds, there is a \"very small chance\" of brief tornadoes forming throughout the night. As far as rain potential, the county could receive anywhere between half an inch to one inch of rain by the end of the night, according to the NWS. By Wednesday morning, Albright said most of the effects from the storm should be gone. Until then, the NWS advises residents to use a weather radio or have Emergency Alert System notifications turned on their smartphones to ensure all necessary warnings are received. \"Have a method by which you can receive notifications throughout the night,\" Albright said. \"I know it sucks when the warning goes off and wakes you up at 2 in the morning ... but it's better to be safe than sorry.\" Get today’s headlines delivered to your email box free.",
