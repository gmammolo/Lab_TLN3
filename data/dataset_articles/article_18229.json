  "text": "China's Snow Village Caught Using Fake Cotton Snow\nChengdu Snow Village, located in Sichuan Province, issued a public apology via social media.\nA \"snow village\"-themed tourist attraction in China was forced to temporarily close after visitors discovered that the \"snow\" used was not real but a mixture of cotton wool and soapy water.\nChengdu Snow Village, located in Sichuan Province, issued a public apology via social media.\nThe apology came after criticism from tourists who felt cheated after finding that the white expanse they expected to be covered in natural snow was actually artificial.\nThe management admitted they were forced to use fake snow due to the warmer-than-usual weather.\n\"The results we obtained did not meet our expectations and instead created a negative impression among tourists,\" said an official statement from the village.\nThey also regretted not being able to provide the snow scenes that visitors expected.\n\"We sincerely apologize for not being able to present real snow scenes and for forcing visitors to change their travel plans,\" the statement continued, as quoted by UPI.\nThe tourist attraction was temporarily closed as a result of this incident. Local officials are now examining other options to address the issue before deciding whether to reopen the destination.\nThis incident sparked discussion online. Many social media users questioned transparency in the operation of tourist destinations, especially regarding weather conditions that can affect the tourist experience.",
