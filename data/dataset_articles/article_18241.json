  "text": "JACKSON COUNTY, Ore. -- \"We work on ecological restoration projects for the benefit of wildlife habitat on the one hand, but tremendous community benefits as well,\" Rogue River Watershed Council Executive Director Brian Barr tells NewsWatch 12. “All of our projects have a positive impact on the water quality in streams like Bear Creek, Elk Creek, Little Butte Creek, and those benefits to water quality run to everyone that uses the river.”\nIn 2024, RRWC worked on a habitat restoration project along the Bear Creek greenway in Talent, Ore., an area that was devastated by the Almeda Fire in 2020.\n“The total cost of that project was just short of $1 million,” Barr says. “It took about four years to develop and a summer to implement. A fairly sizable chunk of that funding came from the United States Forest Service, federal funds that helped us get this work on the ground. This summer we were slated to do seven projects throughout Jackson County. The total price tag of all that work is around $4 million and $2.5 million was tabbed as federal funding and we’re not entirely certain that money is going to be available when we go to do the restoration work.”\nThese projects aim to restore habitats by improving water quality, soaking flood plains with water to help creeks and rivers flow in dryer months and creating natural environments that are welcoming for wildlife like salmon, steelhead and more. However, wildlife aren’t the only living beings that benefit from RRWC’s work.\n“This water [in Bear Creek] will flow into the Rogue River and down to the cities of Gold Hill, Rogue River and Grants Pass,” Barr says. “Some portion of this water will get pulled up into the drinking water intakes in those cities and get sent out to folks that rely on drinking water in those towns. Cleaner water impacts you when you turn your faucet on and I really think that’s one of the things we take for granted when we turn our faucet on.”\nWith the funding uncertainty, RRWC is holding off on contracting work for five of the seven projects along the Upper Rogue River this year.\n\"We have saddled up to our computers and we are writing a lot of proposals right now to foundations and other sources of funding that we haven't really tapped into in the past,” Barr explains. “We'll see how our story plays with them.\"",
