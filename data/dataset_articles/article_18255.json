  "text": "MIDLAND, Texas — An unexpected invader is contributing to Midland’s low water pressure : zebra mussels. The invasive species, known for wreaking havoc on lakes and rivers across North America, has now made its way into the Permian Basin—causing disruptions at the Midland Water Treatment Plant.\n“At the same time, we’ve had zebra mussels at our water treatment plant here in town,” Midland Mayor Lori Blong said in a press conference earlier this week.\nBut what exactly are zebra mussels, and how are they affecting the local water supply?\nZebra mussels are small, bivalve mollusks that thrive in freshwater environments by attaching themselves to surfaces such as rocks, boats, and pipes.\n“A zebra mussel is a little mollusk,” said Michael Nickell with the Sibley Nature Center in Midland. “It’s a little bivalve clam-like thing.”\nWhile they are commonly found in lakes and rivers, their presence in Midland’s water system is surprising, given the city’s location in the arid Permian Basin. Experts say they likely arrived through human activity.\n“People take their boats out for recreation, or for that matter, large ships can pick up these larvae—and even adult zebra mussels—and transport them across the ocean,” Nickell explained. “Now, they’re widespread across North America, and they get into municipal water supplies. If your water supply comes from a body of water like a lake, there’s going to be a risk.”\nZebra mussels reproduce rapidly.\n“The female releases her eggs into the water. The male releases his sperm, and fertilization takes place in the water,” Nickell said. “The little larvae are carried by water currents. They can go from water body to water body just following the currents.”\nBecause of this, the mussels can spread quickly, clinging to boats, trailers, and fishing gear.\n“Mussels will typically attach themselves to boats, trailers, and fishing gear,” Nickell said. “From there, the open water is their oyster.”\nThe City of Midland has been working to filter and treat water from the Colorado River before distributing it through the system. However, zebra mussels pose a serious threat due to their ability to clog infrastructure.\n“They outcompete our native freshwater mussel species,” Nickell said. “And they do a lot of ecological and municipal damage by just clogging things up.”\nDespite their destructive nature, zebra mussels do have one surprising effect on the environment.\n“They’re filter feeders, so as water passes through them, they actually help clean it,” Nickell said.\nBut their benefits are outweighed by the damage they cause, as their populations remain unchecked.\n“They have impacts on the environment as far as cleaning water,” Nickell added. “But their numbers are so great and really unchecked. And so, they do a lot of tremendous damage that way.”\nOnce zebra mussels take hold, they are difficult—if not impossible—to remove completely. The best way to prevent their spread is to clean and dry boats and fishing gear before moving between bodies of water.\n“The best thing boaters can do is keep boats and gear clean and dry,” Nickell emphasized.\nThe City of Midland said crews and engineers are actively working through the issues, with the goal of restoring normal water pressure by the end of the week.\nClose Ad",
