  "text": "A Tesla battery buried in debris months after a house fire suddenly reignited, sparking a hazardous \"thermal runaway\" fire during demolition in Montgomery County, officials said. Firefighters rushed to 21700 Peachtree Road near Barnesville Road in Dickerson around 2:45 p.m. on Wednesday, March 5, after reports of a vehicle and debris fire, according to Montgomery County Fire & Rescue spokesperson Pete Piringer. Crews arrived to find a Tesla car battery engulfed in flames as workers demolished the property where a house fire had occurred on Nov. 11, 2024 . The fire in Montgomery County. Officials said the battery ignited briefly before going into thermal runaway, a dangerous chain reaction where lithium-ion cells overheat and spontaneously catch fire. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, and no injuries were reported. HazMat teams were called in, and a salvage company will handle the cleanup and removal of the battery, officials said. The fire was declared under control at around 4:45 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon. Authorities said all appropriate notifications have been made, and the site will be monitored to ensure no further flare-ups. Want breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute?
