  "text": "SEVIER COUNTY, Tenn. (WATE) — Although it’s been more than eight years, the Sevier County wildfires that happened in 2016 still feel like a recent memory for many East Tennesseans. On Tuesday, the strong winds and dry conditions reminded some firefighters battling brush fires in the county of the fire they fought years ago. Tuesday evening, firefighters with the Parrottsville Volunteer Fire Department responded to the brush fires in Sevier County that prompted evacuations , and ultimately destroyed two structures and damaged a camper that was overturned because of the wind. Earlier in the afternoon, crews with the VFD responded to a mutual aid call in Del Rio, but a few hours later, they were sending two engines and nine firefighters to Sevier County on a mutual aid call. Parrottsville VFD Fire Chief Jacob Henry explained that their firefighters were working to protect homes as the flame front passed through. The task involves using blowers to keep embers and debris away from the home, keeping houses wet as the flame front moved through, and ensuring no embers or burning debris get stuck to the home. “Yesterday, the very first house that we started to protect, an ember got on the eave of it, in a little tight spot that we missed and luckily we had nine guys on the scene, so we were pretty quick to see, ‘Hey, the house is on fire from the eave,’ so we get we got water on it real quick, but you know if somebody [wouldn’t have] been there, the house would have been engulfed, ” Henry shared. Video from the VFD showed the flames from the brush fire just feet away from a building. Henry said the second place they were stationed at was closer to the Cobbly Nob area where there is “house after house.” One of the issues that firefighters faced when getting the brush fires contained was the wind. Several counties in East Tennessee were under a High Wind Warning and a Red Flag Warning, with the possibility that strong gusts of winds could cause any fire that started to quickly spread. Henry explained that with wind like what was seen Tuesday, it can sometimes feel like a never ending battle, regardless of what equipment is available. He also shared that with dry and windy conditions, a large fire can start very easily. “It can be as simple as somebody towing a trailer and the safety chains fall off their truck and create a spark, and you’ve got a fire on the side of the road before somebody can get there you know the wind’s took it and it’s two or three acres,” Henry said. Those conditions are also something that might spark painful memories for those who lived in or near Sevier County in 2016. Henry was a firefighter with the VFD at the time, but he did not respond to the wildfires in Sevier County. He said, however, that the VFD did send an engine to Gatlinburg during those wildfires , and some of the firefighters who responded to that call also helped fight the brush fires Tuesday evening. “I have a few guys that went with us yesterday that went up there and they just said that, you know, the wind [was] exactly how it reminded them of,” Henry said. Parrottsville VFD’s crew battled the blaze overnight and was released from the mutual aid call around 4 a.m. Wednesday. Although two buildings were destroyed, Henry said they are thankful things didn’t get worse. “It’s just in one of those places in the woods, you know when fires do happen, they can turn bad quick,” Henry said. “I’m glad that the fire didn’t start like, two or three days ago when we didn’t have no rain. It would have been a rough two or three days.” While Henry said Tuesday was “just another day on the job,” he added that it’s also something they volunteer to do because they love to do it.
