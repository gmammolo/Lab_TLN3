  "text": "Grass spark that ignites\n.\nHighlights\n- With 5,700 fire mishap cases recorded last March, officials brace for impact this year. It is during this dry and hot month that they receive maximum emergency calls as grass fires tend to spread rapidly\n- Human negligence to blame in most cases, say officials\nBy Sanjana CS\nAs the city transitions from the mild weather of February to the increasing warmth of March, incidents ofgrass fires are cropping up all around. Fire and Emergency Services are getting ready as last year, March recorded 5,700 fire mishap cases, the highest number of such incidents.\nFire officials warn that most of these blazes originate from grass fires, but spread swiftly due to rising temperatures and parched conditions.\nRecently, more than 100 seized vehicles were reduced to ashes in a massive fire that broke out in a ground adjacent to the JDS office. The vehicles, impounded by the police, were parked at Jakkarayanakere ground near Seshadripuram when the blaze erupted in the morning.\nOfficials suspected that a discarded cigarette may have ignited the dry grass covering the field, triggering the inferno. The fire, which broke out around 11 am, quickly engulfed the parking lot, destroying cars, autorickshaws, and two-wheelers.\nFire & Emergency Services Department Director (RFO) Yunas Ali Kausar said, “Grass blazes often start from carelessly discarded cigarette butts, unattended bonfires,\nor spontaneous combustion of dry grass and leaves.\nMarch is the most challenging month for us.\nThe combination of dry weather, strong winds, and human negligence makes grass fires a major concern.”\nIn 2024\nAccording to data from the Fire and Emergency Services, the department received 23,832 fire calls in 2024, with 18,900 occurring between January and May. The onset of summer typically leads to a rise in fire incidents.\nFrom January to May, there was an intense surge in emergencies, averaging 3,780 fire calls per month—translating to nearly 126 incidents every single day. As summer peaks, fire-related cases soar, keeping firefighters on high alert. (March recorded the highest number of fire calls (5,700), followed by February (4,800), April (4,700), January (2,000), and May (1,700). The lowest number of calls was reported in June and July, with 400 incidents each.)\nIn contrast, the latter half of the year, from June to December, sees a significant drop in fire incidents. The department receives an average of 705 calls per month, with just 24 cases reported daily.\nIn the previous year, fire accidents claimed 48 lives across the state, leaving 201 people injured. Property damage from these incidents exceeded Rs 330 crore. Bengaluru alone accounted for 2,947 fire calls, resulting in 13 fatalities and multiple injuries.\nHowever the number of cases reported due to grass fire is unknown but fire officials attribute “the spike in incidents primarily to the proliferation of grass fires, which spread rapidly and unpredictably, often posing a significant threat to nearby residential areas”.\nThe dry, parched landscapes that fringe Bengaluru’s urban sprawl have become tinderboxes, ready to ignite at the slightest provocation. Kausar explains that other causes include electrical short-circuits, while there is a decline in fire incidents due to gas cylinder and LPG leaks, industrial fires etc.\nHuman negligence to blame?\nOfficials suggest that many of these fires are preventable. Careless littering of burning materials, open burning of garbage, and setting dry grass ablaze for clearing land have all contributed to the growing crisis. “People don’t realise that a small spark can turn into a disaster within seconds. Once the fire spreads, it becomes a challenge to control,” added the fire officer.\n“Many people are unaware of the speed at which a grass fire can spread,” the officer added. “What starts as a small, controlled burn can quickly become an uncontrollable blaze, especially when wind is a factor.”\nThe fire department conducts an awareness campaign on Saturdays at schools hoping students will learn and pass on the message to their parents. Fire & Emergency Services Department Director TN Shivashankar explained, “To prevent grass fire incidents, always dispose of cigarettes properly, never leave open flames unattended, regularly maintain equipment, monitor dry weather conditions, keep grass trimmed, avoid parking on dry grass, and clear debris from your property, especially during hot, dry periods when the risk of fire is heightened.”\nAs the city transitions from the mild weather of February to the increasing warmth of March, incidents of\nFire officials warn that most of these blazes originate from grass fires, but spread swiftly due to rising temperatures and parched conditions.\nRecently, more than 100 seized vehicles were reduced to ashes in a massive fire that broke out in a ground adjacent to the JDS office.
