  "text": "Cuts like a knife\n.\nPetition demands removal of\nspiked fences in public constructions as many have caused lethal injuries to stray animals\nAnimal lovers have launched a campaign demanding that the government put a stop to using spiked fences in public construction and also remove the existing ones as such fences pose danger to\nstray dogs. They said these fences have been causing immense suffering and harm to animals, often resulting in fatal injuries.\nThe\nCJ Memorial Trust has launched a petition, addressed to BBMP Chief Engineer, on February 28 emphasising on the urgent need to replace spiked fences in public construction. The petition stated that the Bangalore SPCA has already raised concerns about this issue, citing instances where dogs have gotten stuck and impaled on these fences, leading to painful deaths. It stated that the medical cost of recovery for one such cruelly caught dog was over Rs 1.3 lakh apart from three months in a hospital.\nThe petition proposed immediate actions including ensuring that all fences around the city, especially in public parks and buildings, have smooth edges and no spikes.\n“If spikes are already present, weld and file them away immediately for safety. The authorities have to incorporate designs that prioritise animal and human safety in BBMP and PWD engineering manuals.\nWe are happy to provide examples of humane fence designs,’’ the petition read.\nThey emphasised that it is crucial that BBMP takes a strong stance on this issue.\nAbout the spiked fences in and around Cubbon Park,\nTanya Bhat, an animal lover from Cooke Town, said the design of the existing fence is wrong. “The fence at Cubbon Park must be redesigned as it is dangerous to stray dogs,’’ said Bhat.\nThe SPCA, based on a complaint dated January 11, 2024, from CJ Memorial Trust, wrote a letter to the Deputy Director (Cubbon Park),\nHorticulture Department on January 12, to take measures to replace spiked fences in Cubbon Park.\nPriya Chetty-Rajagopal, Managing Trustee of CJ Memorial Trust, said that it is important to not only resolve this present issue now (by welding out the sharp spikes)on a war footing but also to ensure that any future construction precludes and bars cruel spikes.\n“All agencies like BBMP, PWD, SPCA, KAWB, and contractors associations should come together to incorporate this design and understand that we are breaching\nanimal cruelty laws.\nNo excuses about lack of responsibility or funds. It just has to be done and as early as possible as lives are at stake,’’ she said.\nShe said that there have been many in the city including cats and dogs that have jumped and fallen on spikes. “It is horrific to see such suffering, but I can share the ones at Cubbon Park . The Cubbon team rescued four, who survived being ripped by the spikes and one ran away despite a 10-day hunt,’’ she said.\nKusuma G, Deputy Director (Cubbon Park), Horticulture Department, told BM the filing down of spikes on fences will be done in phases.\nAnimal lovers have launched a campaign demanding that the government put a stop to using spiked fences in public construction and also remove the existing ones as such fences pose danger to\nThe\nThe petition proposed immediate actions including ensuring that all fences around the city, especially in public parks and buildings, have smooth edges and no spikes.\n“If spikes are already present, weld and file them away immediately for safety.
