  "text": "20 chickens dead after Red Clover Township barn fire\nTwenty chickens inside a Carlton County barn are dead after a fire around noon Wednesday, according to Lt. Doug Rotta with the Carlton County Sheriff’s Office.\nFire officials received a call about a barn with black smoke coming from it on the 5200 block of Krogh Road in Red Clover Township.\nThe sheriff’s office said the fire was likely started by space heaters left in the barn and no suspicious activity is suspected. The homeowners were not present at the time of the fire and no other injuries were reported.\nThe Cromwell Wright Fire Department reported seeing heavy black smoke before arrival at the barn and reported the barn fully engulfed in flames upon arrival, according to Rotta.\nThere were 20 total chickens inside the barn and all of them died, the sheriff’s office said.\nCromwell Wright fire crews requested help from multiple fire departments, including the Carlton, Esko, and Kettle River Fire Departments, Rotta said. The Carlton County Highway Patrol sanded roadways for firefighters and Lake Country Power was called to shut off the barn’s power.\nRotta said firefighters were on scene for around two hours and the barn was reported as a total loss.",
