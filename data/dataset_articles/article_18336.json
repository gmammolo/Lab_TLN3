  "text": "Officials urge caution as high winds fuel car fire\nLONDON, Ky. (WYMT) - Strong winds swept through Eastern Kentucky Tuesday night and Wednesday, causing and intensifying fires in the region. A car fire in London quickly escalated due to the conditions.\nORIGINAL STORY:\nFire officials said the driver of the vehicle noticed smoke while driving along Highway 192 and pulled into the Frisch’s Big Boy parking lot. Moments later, flames engulfed the car from the engine to the trunk.\nBattalion Chief Ricky George with the London City Fire Department said crews arrived to find the car fully involved. It took two fire trucks and about 20 minutes to put out the flames. However, high winds made containment even more challenging.\n”Fire feeds off of oxygen, and the wind just kept building the fire more and more,” George explained.\nFirefighters also had to deal with burning fluids spreading across the parking lot due to the vehicle’s gas tank melting.\n”I would say percentage-wise, it probably ups it 30 to 40% just for a simple fact you’re having to fight the fire plus the wind and you got fluids pushing everywhere,” George said. ”At first, it’s a losing battle, but my guys last night got it contained pretty quick and got a good knockdown on it.”\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation, but officials said it serves as a warning about the dangers of fire season.\nPete Geogerian, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson, said wind speeds in Laurel County reached more than 40 miles per hour, worsening fire conditions in the area.\n”Wind is probably the single biggest effect on fire behavior,” Geogerian said. ”So anytime you get strong winds, those fire lengths just grow exponentially. And we did have a red flag warning yesterday because of the high winds and also the dry air mass that was in place leading up to the rain that eventually came in overnight.”\nNo one was seriously hurt in the fire, though the driver was checked out for smoke inhalation. Meanwhile, fire and weather officials warn that similar conditions could spark more fires in the coming weeks.\nFrom now until April 30, burning is prohibited between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. within 150 feet of the woods or brush. Officials urge residents to follow local burn bans and take precautions to prevent wildfires.\nCopyright 2025 WYMT. All rights reserved.",
