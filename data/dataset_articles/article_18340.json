  "text": "Wildfires leave path of destruction in Mingo County\nMINGO COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) - Wildfires burning through Mingo County have charred trees and left behind a path of destruction.\nMingo County resident Sabrina Grace says seeing flames close to her home was concerning.\n“And I walked by my kitchen window and you could just see it and you just, you know you just have concerns, it’s your home, it’s your property and you just want to make sure that you are able to protect it,” Grace said.\nTwo fires were burning in Mingo County, one in the Dan’s Branch area and one in the Mate Creek area and both have been contained. Assistant Region Forester\nCharlie Spencer said, in the containing process, they work to remove the fuel.\n“Which is the leaf litter on the ground, that’s what’s burning. So we go in and use leaf blowers, fire rakes, sometimes bulldozers to remove that fuel and create a containment line around the fire,” Spencer said.\nPreventing wildfires is easy to do, and Spencer said Smokey the Bear put it best.\n“Only you can prevent forest fires, so if everyone takes that to heart and always obey the fire restrictions that we have. They are there a purpose, they are not there just because we want to make people’s lives hard,” Spencer said.\nAnother way to prevent wildfires from happening is not burning anything during windy conditions, according to Spencer.\nCopyright 2025 WSAZ.
