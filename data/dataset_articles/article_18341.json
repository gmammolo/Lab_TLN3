  "text": "Shell’s Deer Park Facility , the subject of a state lawsuit and federal investigations for environmental harm caused by petrochemical fires at their plant, might be up for sale according to a report. Shell is considering selling several chemical assets in the U.S and Europe, but the only asset named was the Deer Park Facility, Wall Street Journal reported this week. Private equity firms and Middle Eastern buyers were reported as potential bidders, the Journal reported. The other chemical assets are in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, the U.K, Germany and the Netherlands, the Journal reported. Shell Energy Solutions, a Texas-based retail electricity provider, said last October they planned to layoff approximately 100 Houston-area employees by mid-December. ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATION: Shell Deer Park fire: Texas sues company over environmental violations The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality sued Shell for up to $1 million in Aug. 2023 over their handling of a 70-hour fire, reporting that Shell unlawfully discharged “mass quantities of air contaminants” and nearly 70 million gallons of wastewater into the Houston Ship Channel. Several workers also sued Shell for injuries suffered during the fire, which Shell said occurred during routine maintenance . Shell’s Deer Park Facility was also the subject of a 2023 investigation by the U.S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), which found the company could have prevented a 2019 petrochemical fire at the site. RESIDENT IMPACT: Shell fire hit after residents call out state on ITC permit The 2019 fire breached tanks that released up to 523,000 barrels of chemical products and caused significant environmental damage, the CSB said. Researchers found hazardous \"forever chemicals\" , known as PFA’s, in local waterways for months after the fire, and residents complained of health issues following the fire. The Deer Park Facility that Shell is considering selling is adjacent to the PEMEX Oil and Gas Refinery, which Shell previously partly owned. The PEMEX refinery is the site where a hydrogen sulfide gas leak last October killed two, injured at least 35 and caused a shelter in place to be put into order. Months before the PEMEX gas leak, Deer Park officials complained to the company about a lack of transparency and prompt notification about previous chemical leaks, according to records obtained by the Houston Chronicle. The potential sale of Shell, the Wall Street Journal reported, is in the early stages, as company officials work with bankers to review all its chemical assets.
