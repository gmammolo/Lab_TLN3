  "text": "Australia's coal-fired power stations are unreliable and driving up electricity prices, according to a new report out today, on the eve of a federal election campaign in which the viability of keeping coal plants going longer will be a key focus. Australia's largest coal-fired power station is unreliable and driving up electricity prices, according to a new report that argues against the viability of keeping coal plants open beyond their scheduled closure dates.\nThe report from clean energy consultancy group Nexa Advisory questions the wisdom of a New South Wales government deal to extend the life of the Origin Energy-owned Eraring.\nLast year, the state's Labor government struck a deal with Origin to keep the 43-year-old coal plant open for an additional two years, until August 2027.\nEraring is the largest coal-fired power station in the country, supplying NSW with about a quarter of its electricity needs.\nUnder the agreement, the state government agreed to cover Origin's operational losses of up to $225 million a year from 2025.\nOrigin Energy has until the end of this month to opt into the underwriting deal for 2025-26.\nThe NSW government's move to extend the life of Eraring followed concerns that the state would struggle to keep the lights on, after Origin announced it would bring forward the plant's closure by seven years, to August 2025.\nEraring coal-fired power station at Lake Macquarie, 1.5 hours north of Sydney, is Australia's largest. ((Shuttershock: Harley Kingston))\nWhile Origin has said Eraring's operations will not be extended beyond April 2029, energy experts say that timeline leaves the door open to further taxpayer support, beyond the current deal that runs until 2027.\nNexa Advisory's report argues against further taxpayer assistance for Eraring, given the plant's \"unreliability\" due to frequent outages.\nNexa analysed the performance data of Eraring and found each of its four units had experienced about 6,000 hours, equivalent to two months, of downtime annually over the last four years and that these outages had affected the plant's availability when it was needed most.\n\"While there is variability across units each year, there has been a steady upward trend in overall downtime…\nRhiana Whitson",
