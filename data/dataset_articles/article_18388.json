  "text": "A health warning about smoke from a fire at a landfill site has been issued for Cayman Brac.\nEnvironmental health officials said people downwind of the dump should keep doors and windows closed and limit outside activity in areas where smoke persisted.\nThe caution came after smoke and flames were spotted at the landfill site on Tuesday afternoon.\nFirefighters fought the blaze into Wednesday to bring it under control.\nBut an environmental health spokesman said, “There remains smoke generating from the site, but this is reducing.\n“The department of environmental health is working to place cover materials over the area to reduce this impact further.”\nThe landfill was closed on Wednesday as the covering work and damping down of the fire site continued.\nOfficials said the cause of the blaze was unknown, but it is thought that recently deposited trash ignited and caused the fire.\nContact the environmental health department on 949 6696, by email at dehcustomerservice@gov.ky or visit its website here or message its Facebook page here for further information.",
