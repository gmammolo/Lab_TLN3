  "text": "By Andrew LEESON\nPublished 03/05/25 AT 8:48 PM EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Share on Flipboard Share on Pocket\nA woman paddles past a yacht at Wellington Point in Brisbane on March 5, 2025. Tropical Cyclone Alfred veered towards Australia's densely populated eastern coast on March 5, sparking emergency warnings, closing hundreds of schools, and threatening to flood thousands of homes. AFP The outer fringe of a tropical cyclone started whipping eastern Australia on Thursday, bringing drenching rains and record-breaking waves to a heavily populated region rarely hit by typhoons.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred was 285 kilometres (180 miles) east of busy Brisbane city after unexpectedly slowing above the Coral Sea overnight, government forecasts said.\nSome four million people were in the firing line along a 400-kilometre (250-mile) stretch of coastline expected to see the worst of the storm.\n\"We're already seeing gales developing on the coastal fringe,\" Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Sarah Scully told AFP.\n\"There have been very large waves and powerful swells. That's generated by Alfred lingering in the Coral Sea and creating a whole lot of wave energy.\"\nA 12.4-metre (40-foot) wave was recorded on the Gold Coast south of Brisbane, Scully said, the largest swell ever picked up by that monitoring station.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred was initially forecast to strike land late on Thursday evening, but was now expected to arrive Friday afternoon or even early Saturday morning.\nWhile this gave coastal hamlets more time to stack sandbags and stockpile food, Scully warned it also left them exposed to wild weather on the storm's outer edges.\n\"It will mean that the coastal areas are exposed for a longer period of time.\"\nSome towns had already seen \"well over\" 200 millimetres (8 inches) of rain, Scully said.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred would cross the coast somewhere near the bustling metropolitan hub of Brisbane, the weather bureau said.\nIt would be the first cyclone to make landfall in the area for more than 50 years.\n\"There's a lot of people in harm's way here. We're talking about something like four-and-a-half million Australians,\" said senior government minister Jim Chalmers.\n\"It's rare for a cyclone to be this far south and to threaten such a huge population area.\"\nAmerican rap star Ice Cube was caught in the storm ahead of concert dates in southern cities Sydney and Melbourne.\n\"I'm staying clear of it. I haven't been through a cyclone before. I can check this off my bucket list for sure,\" he told Australia's Channel 10.\n\"I'm right here on the beach. The beach looks like it is going to be in the lobby in a minute.\"\nStrong winds knocked out power to more than 4,000 homes, utility company Essential Energy said.\nMore than 900 schools across Queensland and the flood-prone northern rivers region of New South Wales were closed on Thursday morning, education department officials said.\nWhile cyclones are common in the warm tropical waters lapping Australia's northern flank, it is rarer for them to form in cooler waters further south.\nTropical Cyclone Alfred would be the first to make landfall in that part of Australia since 1974, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\nResearchers have repeatedly warned that climate change amplifies the risk of natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and cyclones.\nA resident watches massive waves stirred by tropical cyclone Alfred break onto the North Wall breakwater located at the coastal town of Ballina on March 5, 2025.
