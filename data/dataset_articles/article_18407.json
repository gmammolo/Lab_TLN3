Meanwhile, Sector 62’s air quality remains moderate, with high PM10 levels posing potential health risks for sensitive groups.\nNoida Fights Triple Fires, Air Quality Dips\nPhoto : PTI\n(Noida: Residents of Noida saw a tense and smoky Wednesday as three massive fires broke out in different parts of the city. Thick plumes of smoke filled the air, reducing visibility and causing panic among locals. Fortunately, no casualties have been reported in any of the incidents.\nSlum Fire Near Sector 63 Called For Emergency Response\nThe first blaze erupted in the Chotpur slum area near Sector 63, sending thick smoke billowing into the sky. Fire officer Pradeep Kumar confirmed that several fire tenders arrived promptly to tackle the flames.\n\"We reached the spot immediately and started controlling the fire. Within half an hour, we managed to bring it under control. Thankfully, no one was injured,\" he said.\nRaging Flames at Dumping Grounds and Expressway\nIn a separate incident, a fire broke out at the Noida Authority’s dumping ground in Sector 32. Strong winds fanned the flames, making them spread rapidly across the landfill. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but emergency teams worked quickly to contain the situation.\nLater in the day, another major fire started at a garbage dump near Sector 128, close to the Greater Noida Expressway. The flames spread to nearby forested areas, alarming residents as thick smoke clouded the roads.\nVideos circulating on social media showed bright orange flames lighting up the night, with smoke hanging heavy in the air. Fire brigades and police rushed to the scene and controlled the situation.\nChief Fire Officer Pradeep Kumar confirmed that all three fires were eventually brought under control. \"The fire has been doused, and our teams are now focusing on cooling operations to prevent any reignition,\" he assured.\nNoida AQI Today\nThe air quality in Sector 62, Noida, is currently moderate, which may cause mild discomfort for sensitive groups. PM2.5 levels, which represent fine dust particles, averaged 52 µg/m³, ranging from 35 to 76 µg/m³. This indicates moderate pollution that could cause minor breathing issues for people with respiratory problems. PM10 levels, which measure larger dust particles, were significantly higher, averaging 119 µg/m³ and reaching a peak of 164 µg/m³, which is a cause for concern as prolonged exposure may impact breathing and overall health. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) levels were moderate, averaging 21 µg/m³, while Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels remained low at 15 µg/m³, posing no immediate health risks. Ozone (O3) levels were also within safe limits, averaging 45 µg/m³, which does not pose a significant threat. While the overall air quality is not hazardous, sensitive individuals like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues may experience discomfort, particularly due to the high PM10 levels.\n(With inputs from news agencies)\nGet\nLatest NewsLive on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines fromMahakumbh 2025,Delhi Election,Noida News,Cityand around the world.Trending:\nAvni Arya author\nAvni's journey at Times Now began in August 2023 after successfully completing a one-month internship.
