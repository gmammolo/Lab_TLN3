  "text": "By Niku Kazori\nClick here for updates on this story\n SIERRA MADRE, California ( KABC ) — With the latest winter storm dropping rain across SoCal, an evacuation warning was issued Tuesday for parts of Sierra Madre, which was hit hard by severe flooding, mudslides and debris flows during the last round of heavy rain.\nThis week’s storm is categorized as a Phase 1 event, which means there’s a 10-20% chance of more significant flooding and debris flows in burn scar areas.\nThe evacuation warning for high-risk areas in Sierra Madre went into effect at 6 a.m. and will remain in place through 6 a.m. Friday.\nStreet parking is prohibited in areas under evacuation warnings or orders.\nLast month’s storm filled every debris basin in the area to capacity. City and county officials say they’ve been working to clear them, but they aren’t empty.\nPolice say once a flow starts, it’s too late to evacuate. That means those who stay behind may be trapped for days until emergency crews can access the area.\nThe following zones in Sierra Madre are under the evacuation warning. Check the Genasys app for more information.\nSMD E002B SMD E003 SMD E004 SMD E005 SMD E006A SMD E006B SMD E007 SMD E008 SMD E009 SMD E010A SMD E010B SMD E010C SMD E011A SMD E011C SMD E012A SMD E012B SMD E012C SMD E012D SMD E019\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
