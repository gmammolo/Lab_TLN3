  "text": "The Waipoua forest fire, which burned through about 100 hectares, was caused by a rubbish fire that got out of control, Fire and Emergency New Zealand revealed on Thursday.\nLast week, residents were evacuated from Waipoua Settlement in Northland as the blaze threatened over 20 homes.\nUp to 100 firefighters were on the ground fighting the fire, alongside eight helicopters.\nA total fire ban is imposed across much of Northland after the fire broke-out.\nThe prohibited fire season included Muriwhenua or Te Hiku area at the top of the Far North along with the entire west coast of Northland, including North and South Hokianga, and the Ripiro and Paparoa fire districts.\nAny previously issued fire permits in those areas were been cancelled.\nIwi leader Snow Tane said about a third of the evacuees returned on Sunday night and by Tuesday about two-thirds were back in their homes.\nThose who had yet to return were worried about the possibility of another flare-up and particularly about the health effects of lingering smoke.\nMore to come.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
