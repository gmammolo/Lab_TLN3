  "text": "‘Long-term prognosis is grim’ – sea ice area has melted to smallest size on record, and that’s bad news for Ireland\nThe global sea ice area has shrunk to the smallest size ever recorded as air and sea temperatures continue to rise.\nIn the Arctic, 42,000 sq km of ice melted last month – an area twice the size of Wales.\nMelting sea ice is one of the most significant effects of climate change that scientists have warned about.\nIce reflects back the rays of the sun, so the less there is, the more heat is absorbed by the planet, which in turn leads to more ice melting in an accelerating feedback loop.\nIt also causes sea-level rise and flooding and disrupts ocean and air currents that dictate weather patterns in neighbouring regions.\nThat leaves countries such as Ireland, which is relatively close to the polar north, vulnerable to sudden southward shifts in cold polar air.\nProfessor Richard Allan, of the University of Reading, who analysed the latest assessment from the EU’s Copernicus climate change service, said: “The long-term prognosis for Arctic sea ice is grim.”\nThe assessment looks at the combined measurement of sea ice cover in both polar regions.\nClimate disruption and extreme weather events have been worse than feared\nArctic sea ice, currently 8pc below average, may increase slightly as the ice usually reaches it maximum extent in March.\nAntarctic sea ice, however, is 26pc below average, and it is not certain if that is as low as it will go this season.\nThe past month was the third warmest February on record globally, while sea surface temperatures remained “unusually high”.\nFebruary was also the 19th out of the last 20 months that temperatures averaged more than 1.5C above the norm experienced before fossil-fuel use soared.\nTen years ago, 195 countries signed the Paris Agreement, pledging to keep temperature rise to what was then considered a relatively safe level of 1.5C.\nSince then, the rise and exceedance of 1.5C has happened faster, while climate disruption and extreme weather events have been worse than feared.\nThe assessment comes as the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said a hoped-for period of temporary cooling will be cut short.\nEl Niño and La Niña are natural phenomena caused by periodic temperature changes in the Pacific and the resulting spread and contraction of warm air that create heating and cooling effects.\nLa Niña, the cooling influence, is currently in effect but the WMO said it was “weak” and “likely to be short-lived”.\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
