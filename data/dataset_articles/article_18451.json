  "text": "SEARCY, Ark. – More than 10,000 Arkansans felt the wind’s power Wednesday when it took their power away. The number bounced up and down before utility companies restored power to all but a few thousand customers at sunset. In White County, more than 1,000 customers lost power but the number was cut to only 20. Caden McChristian saw the havoc that 50 mph wind gusts caused. Possessions blown into neighbor’s yards, toppled trash cans, and slam dunks anyone could make were evidence of what blew through Arkansas. “It was terrible this morning right about the time everything shut off. You couldn’t hardly walk outside,” MCChristian stated. He went to work at iDO Rentals & Sales at 7 a.m. By 8 a.m. the business lost power and work came to a halt. “If we don’t have power, we don’t have a way to make payment on stuff. It just kind of throws a hoop in everything,” McChristian stated. Michael Beasley said he started seeing trees snap around 10 p.m. Tuesday. His entire apartment complex lost power. “There’s really nothing we can do. No electricity. We’re just stuck,” Beasley said. “I’m more worried about my groceries in the freezer. I got deer meat in there. I don’t want to lose none of that.” Entergy provides electricity to both locations. Entergy Spokesperson Heather Kendrick sent a statement saying in part: “Crews have restored power to several thousand customers and will continue working throughout the day to complete the restoration…Anytime there are wind gusts more than 35 mph associated with a storm, the winds can cause outages.” Entergy said most customers should have power restored by 10:00 pm Wednesday, with more inaccessible areas being restored by noon Thursday. First Electric Cooperatives spokesperson Rob Roedel said windy days are much like a normal day of repairs because outages are scattered instead of in concentrated areas. He added something knocked into the line is most often the cause, so he asked anyone who sees a tree or limb touching a line to report it. “It really helps us because that actually helps avoid an outage because we can get out there and clean it off the line,” Roedel stated.
