  "text": "DOGE cancels NOAA leases, threatening key weather centers and forecasting capabilities\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is canceling NOAA leases for key forecasting centers, raising concerns about the future of U.S. weather predictions and emergency preparedness.\nThe federal government is moving to cancel leases for key NOAA weather facilities, including the NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction. These facilities house critical weather forecasting operations that support the National Weather Service (NWS) and military agencies. Experts warn that closing these centers could disrupt vital weather models and forecasting systems, potentially impacting public safety.\nKey Weather Facilities at Risk\nThe NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction in College Park, Maryland, is on the lease cancellation list. This facility integrates multiple forecasting centers and ensures the accuracy of weather data used in daily forecasts. The Environmental Modeling Center, housed in this building, runs numerical models crucial for tracking storms and severe weather.\nAnother facility on the list is the Radar Operations Center in Norman, Oklahoma, which supports Doppler radar maintenance and development. This center plays a major role in improving radar technology that helps detect tornadoes and severe storms. If these facilities close, experts say forecasting accuracy and response time could suffer significantly.\nExpert Warnings on Forecasting Impacts\nMeteorologists and scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that losing these centers could cripple U.S. weather prediction. The models developed and maintained at these facilities are essential for predicting hurricanes, winter storms, and other extreme weather events.\nAt the heart of these forecasting efforts lies a powerful tool: numerical weather prediction (NWP), which serves as the foundation of modern meteorology. Using complex equations and computer simulations, NWP enables meteorologists to anticipate weather patterns days in advance, improving storm tracking and public warnings.\nCanceling NOAA leases at these critical forecasting centers could severely disrupt numerical weather prediction, hindering the development and operation of essential models.\nGovernment Response and Uncertainty\nA White House official stated that the administration is simply reevaluating lease terms and has not yet issued formal cancellation letters. However, NOAA employees fear the move is part of a broader effort to downsize the agency, as recent mass layoffs and budget cuts suggest a shift in priorities.\nSenator Chris Van Hollen has called for investigations into the potential closures, emphasizing the need to preserve NOAA’s essential services. As hurricane season approaches, many meteorologists worry that these cuts could leave the country vulnerable to severe weather without the resources needed to track and predict storms effectively.\nNews reference:\nFreedman, A. “DOGE moves to cancel NOAA leases on key weather buildings”https://www.axios.com/2025/03/03/doge-noaa-weather-building-leases-trump",
