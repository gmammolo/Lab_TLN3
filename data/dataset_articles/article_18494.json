  "text": "The Mid North Coast is being asked to prepare for the worst-case scenario when it comes to the possible impact of Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\n\"People should know their risk,\" NSW SES Mid North Coast deputy zone commander Tony Day said.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood watch for the Mid North Coast, where moderate to major flooding may develop late on Friday (March 7) afternoon.\nRainfall associated with Tropical Cyclone Alfred may cause rapid river rises along NSW coastal rivers from the Queensland border to Port Macquarie.\n\"It's very unpredictable at this stage, just depending on how fast that rain depression moves along the ranges in that southerly direction but associated with that rain, which presents its own problems, will be the storm surges, high waves and subsequent coastal erosion,\" he said.\nMr Day said the combination of those weather impacts presents the organisation with a \"unique challenge\".\nThere's a possibility people may be cut off from essential services and power, given the associated rainfall and potential flooding predicted when the cyclone makes landfall.\nMr Day is encouraging residents to limit travel over the weekend, to \"hunker down\" and \"ride this out\".\nHe said people shouldn't \"panic buy\" but stock up on essential items, including medications.\nThere's no guarantee, Mr Day said, if the significant impact does eventuate that the NSW SES will be able to respond to every call for assistance.\nIn March 2021, the region was hit by a\nsignificant flooding event, and Mr Day said the organisation is concerned that this event will be similar.\nHowever, he said this time around, there are other issues that may create challenges, including significant storm surges and wave heights.\n\"As that water moves down the catchment and then normally discharges into the sea, this time around, there's going to be a lot of water around pushing it back up again,\" he said.\n\"That's going to exacerbate things for us.\"\nThe location of the heaviest rainfall and most severe flooding will depend on the track of Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\nKey focus areas for the NSW SES Mid North Coast members include the Nambucca area and the Macleay area, including the potential for isolation of South West Rocks, Hat Head and Crescent Heads.\nIn Port Macquarie, Settlement Point, the North Shore, Hastings River Drive and Hibbard areas are likely to be focus points for the organisation.\nMeanwhile, Dunbogan, Logans Crossing and North Haven are key areas of concern in the Camden Haven.\nMembers of the NSW SES are currently door-knocking in those communities to ensure people are prepared for what's to come.\nIt's likely the rainfall will start on Friday, but continue across the weekend.\nThe Albanese and Minns Governments have activated disaster assistance to communities in 15 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Northern NSW in anticipation of the cyclone's impact.\nThe NSW Government's Natural Disaster Declaration applies to the LGAs of: Ballina, Bellingen, Byron, Clarence Valley, Coffs Harbour, Dungog, Kempsey, Kyogle, Lismore, Lord Howe Island, MidCoast, Nambucca Valley, Port Macquarie-Hastings, Richmond Valley and Tweed.\nThe NSW SES advises residents to prepare their homes for strong winds by putting away loose items around their homes, trimming trees away from properties and not parking vehicles under trees or powerlines.\nPrepare an emergency kit with essential items, including identification documents, medications, a torch, a mobile phone charger and a battery-operated radio.\nThe NSW SES is advising people to download the Hazards Near Me App which will include the latest warnings and information for impacted communities.\nIf you need assistance during floods and storms, call the NSW SES on 132 500 or Triple Zero (000) for life-threatening emergencies.\nCatchments listed in the flood watch include:\nDAILY\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",
