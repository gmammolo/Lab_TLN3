  "text": "NEW JERSEY (PIX11) – An injured dolphin was rescued from Monmouth Beach in New Jersey and then euthanized Tuesday, officials said. The Monmouth Beach Police Department received a call at 8 a.m. about a dolphin stuck in a creek. Responding officers located the animal. The dolphin appeared to have an injury to its tail and was beached in the mud, police said on social media . Additional officers and residents joined in to help rescue the dolphin. Officers entered the creek and used a pump to keep the dolphin wet while they waited for further assistance. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center (MMSC) responded to the scene and extracted the dolphin from the mud with the help of a crew and forklift. Officials said the injured dolphin was taken to the MMSC facility for further treatment and care. However, the MMSC said the dolphin was badly injured. “Upon examination, the underweight dolphin was found to be weak and lethargic, with lesions on multiple parts of his body. Abrasions were present on the flukes and pectoral fins. The dolphin’s weakened body condition, coupled with being stuck in the mud without water to support his body weight for an unknown period, made the dolphin’s prognosis for survival very poor. After veterinary assessment, the decision was made to humanely euthanize the animal to prevent further suffering.” After the dolphin was euthanized, it was transported to the New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, where a necropsy will take place. The dolphin was a male, according to officials. Matthew Euzarraga is a multimedia journalist from El Paso, Texas.
