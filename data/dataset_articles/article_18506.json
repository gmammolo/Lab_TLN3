  "text": "Local prairies are threatened by encroaching trees\nTOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Prairies are threatened by a mix of invasive and native plant species. As these species expand their territory, they prevent the growth of local grasses. This is especially true of woody plants, like the Eastern Red Cedar, which can block a necessary resource all plants need.\n“Plants in prairies that are essentially made to live in the light because most of the time you don’t have a lot of shade in a prairie. They’re going to really be tamped down by having something that’s always blocking that light over the top of them,” said Jason Emry, an Associate Professor in the Biology Department of Washburn University.\nOur region has received enough rain that trees are over-shadowing important grasses.\n“Grasses do well where we have relatively dry years, and they can outcompete a lot of these trees, when that moisture just gets in that upper level of the soil because we don’t have very much. But if you start to get these large saturating events of rain, it goes into these deeper layers and that’s where trees can actually root deeper than some of the grasses can.”\nEven local trees that are endemic to the area are expanding their outreach.\n“As prairies might get a little bit wetter, you might see more trees start to encroach. And we do have native trees that are here, so things like dogwoods are a native tree, we have cottonwoods that are native trees, but they’re typically found in areas that are a little bit wetter.”\nLeft unchecked, the trees threaten cattle pastures as well.\n“Deer might browse woody vegetation, but cows don’t really browse that woody vegetation as much. So once they’re starting to move in the prairies, you’re starting to kind of alter that habitat a little bit because you have a plant that wasn’t really there in the first place.”\nThe more trees take root, the harder they are to eliminate.\n“Once they get established, even if you burn it, it might not kill the tree at that point because you obviously have a really well-established tree. It’s not this little baby seedling that’s trying to get going and competing with the grasses.”\nThe Kansas Great Plains Grasslands Initiative is working to preserve grasslands and prairies in Kansas.
