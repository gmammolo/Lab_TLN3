  "text": "SANTA FE\nMichael Welch moved out of Texas City to Santa Fe a little over a dozen years ago to escape urban sprawl, but now he’s worried urban sprawl is coming to him.\nThe sprawl Welch is talking about is a planned 1,000-acre development that, at build out, could double Santa Fe’s population, which U.S. Census estimates put at 12,980 in 2023.\nThe city council in December 2023 approved a development agreement with Tres Rios Laguna Azure LCC for a project that envisions more than 2,800 single-family home lots and 1,200 multifamily units for the tract south of Dickinson Bayou. The development, which also includes plans for commercial buildings for hospitality, entertainment and recreation businesses constructed around a 2-acre manmade lake, could double Santa Fe’s population, which U.S. Census estimates put at 12,980 in 2023.\nWelch is among residents raising concern about a developer’s plan to discharge treated wastewater into a canal system that supplies drinking water. However, such processes are being employed nationwide as population growth and climate change put pressure on the domestic water supply.\nA permit application from Dallas-based Megatel Homes for the Tres Rios Laguna development seeks authorization to “discharge of treated wastewater at a volume not to exceed an annual average flow of 1,330,000 gallons per day.”\nThe proposed water treatment plant would be built right across from Welch’s house on Cowan Road, according to a notification letter he received about the permit application, he said.\nHe’s worried too many people improperly toss everything from prescription drugs to cleaning supplies down their toilets and those chemicals could make their way into locals’ drinking water.\nThe treated wastewater would be discharged into water that’s use is “high aquatic life use for Gulf Coast Water Authority Canal G,” according to the application.\nWelch is worried about big storms such as Tropical Storm Claudette and Hurricane Harvey deluging the area and swamping the planned wastewater treatment plant.\nTropical Storm Claudette dumped 42 inches of rain, a U.S. record, in a 24-hour time frame in July 1979, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricane Harvey, in 2017, brought more than a year’s worth of rain near Clear Creek and flooded hundreds of thousands of homes.\nA review of the permit application has “preliminarily determined that existing water quality uses will not be impaired by this permit action,” according to the revised application filed with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\nThe Texas Department of Commerce’s Water Reclamation Snapshot from 2022 notes that clean water is a prerequisite for economic growth but because it is a finite resource, some Texas cities “are turning to reusable sources such as highly cleaned effluent and recaptured wastewater.”\nReclaimed water is discharged to an environmental buffer watercourse such as a lake, river or aquifer to be used again, according to the Water Reclamation Snapshot.\nThe Texas Water Development Board notes on its website that Texas was home to the nation’s first direct potable reuse facility, the Raw Water Production Facility in Big Spring, which opened 2013. Two more direct potable reuse projects are in the works in El Paso and Liberty Hill, according to the website.\n“The regional water planning groups in Texas estimated that existing supply from water reuse is projected to produce about 714,000 acre-feet of water per year by 2070, constituting a 15 percent increase,” according to the Water Development Board website. “The increase in reuse existing supply is primarily due to an increase in wastewater flows associated with an increasing population and the capacity of existing reuse facilities.”\nPublic comment on the Tres Rios permit application is being accepted on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality website by searching TCEQ Permit No.: WQ0016390001. A public hearing will be held at a to-be-announced date.",
