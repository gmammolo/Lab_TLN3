  "text": "Sports\nFormula 1 Schedule: Full Race Calendar, Dates & Locations\nThe 2025 Formula 1 season is almost upon us. Liveries have been debuted, preseason testing is over and racing is about to commence.\nThe 2025 F1 season keeps all 24 races from the 2024 campaign but the schedule has been greatly shifted. What follows is the complete schedule for the season.\n2025 Formula 1 Schedule and Dates\nWhat Changes Are There in 2025's F1 Schedule?\nWhile the races remain the same, there has been a significant shakeup in the order of races and the dates.\nThe Japanese Grand Prix has been moved up to April 6 as opposed to it's usual slot in September. That puts it back-to-back with the Chinese Grand Prix on March 23.\nThe Azerbaijan Grand Prix has been moved to September 21, which is a move from its typical spring date.\nThe summer break for the 2025 season has also been extended. It will last four weeks instead of three.\n2025 Formula 1 Season Preview\nThe 2025 F1 season should be fascinating. In 2024, Red Bull appeared to be cruising to another constructor championship, until the bottom fell out and McLaren snuck in for victory. Max Verstappen remained dominant, winning his fourth F1 championship, but Red Bull faces several questions moving forward, particularly how young No. 2 driver Liam Lawson will perform.\nPerhaps the biggest storyline this offseason is Lewis Hamilton's move from longtime team Mercedes to Ferrari. The seven-time world champion made a massive change at age 40 and will team with Charles Leclerc in an attempt to put Ferrari back on top.\nMcLaren's late-season surge to the constructor title created optimism that lead driver Lando Norris could challenge Verstappen for the championship in 2025. But No. 2 driver Oscar Piastri won't be looking to take a back seat to his teammate, which could cause tension.\nAll-in-all, the 2025 F1 season should be fascinating to watch.\nMore on Sports Illustrated\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Formula 1 Schedule: Full Race Calendar, Dates & Locations.\nCopyright ABG-SI LLC.
