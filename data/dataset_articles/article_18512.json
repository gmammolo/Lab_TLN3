The house, which was originally damaged during Hurricane Ike, worsened with subsequent storms, officials said. The property had been the subject of code violations and citations over the years.\nOfficials stated late last year, the city notified the owners that the city would seek demolition unless the issues were resolved with a deadline of April 30. After taking ownership of the structure in January, representatives for the bank began working with the city to receive the proper permits and move forward with the demolition.With the permits in place, officials said the demolition started on Tuesday and is expected to be completed by early next week.\nUnited States Latest News, United States Headlines\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\n‘We just needed to take a pause’: Broadway Alaska’s ‘TINA - The Tina Turner Musical’ canceled“TINA - The Tina Turner Musical” has been canceled for its Alaska stop on its tour across North America.\nRead more »\nBlue Ivy Carter Only Turns to Beyoncé for Advice, Says Tina KnowlesSome may say grandma knows best, but in the case of Blue Ivy Carter, it's definitely mamma knows best — at least according to grandma of the hour Tina Knowles.\nRead more »\n'Defend our democracy': Tucsonans protest against Elon Musk's involvement in governmentTina Giuliano is KGUN 9's Northside reporter.
