  "text": "There are concerns hundreds of homes in Warrnambool could be left uninsurable because of new flood modelling, the city council has been told.\nResident Steve Levett aired his concern at a council meeting on Monday, March 3, 2025 saying he had been told by a bank there were dozens of properties that would become uninsurable because of the new South Warrnambool and Dennington flood study.\nHe said the council agenda suggested property values impacted by flood modelling would typically drop by about five to 10 per cent but he'd been told it would be more.\n\"Specific enquiries with a bank confirm that properties that are now uninsurable and have a current collateral value of zero, which is not where I was situated 12 months ago,\" he said.\nMr Levett said it had directly affected his personal and business financial arrangements.\nThe council's city growth director Luke Coughlan said the aim of a recent flood study in South Warrnambool and Dennington was to provide updated planning tools to guide future development in a way that does not expose lives and property to undue risk in the future.\nAnd under the Planning and Environment Act, property valuations were not relevant considerations as part of a planning scheme amendment, he said.\nFears flood study could financially ruin people\nMr Levett also questioned how new flood modelling would impact properties east of Cassidy's Bridge.\n\"If you use the current level you are suggesting for South Warrnambool, and you shift it to the north side of Cassidy's Bridge, there's 1600 homes that are going to be underwater,\" he said.\n\"So council is going to be left with approximately 2000 to 2500 houses that have a net value of zero.\n\"Are you going to calculate my rates based on zero?\"\nAnother resident, who didn't want to be named, said it had the potential to financially ruin Warrnambool people.\nMr Coughlan said until there was funding to do a study, the council doesn't know what the levels would be east of Cassidy's Bridge.\n\"It is something that council needs to revisit,\" he said.\n\"There will likely be some impacts in that area as well. We don't know what the impact is going to be there but it does need to be looked at in the future.\"\nCarrying out a new study in the north Warrnambool area was something that had the backing of some councillors.\nWhy the big change in flood modelling?\nIan Bolden asked why there was such a difference between previous flood modelling and the new one.\nMr Coughlan said the key difference was that the 2007 study considered the 1946 flood as an outlier and disregarded it from their analysis.\n\"The 2007 model did not sufficiently allow for ocean effects,\" he said.\nMr Coughlan said the 2007 model had also oversimplified the Kelly Swamp, Salt Water Swap and Rutledges Cutting system.\n\"Three significant floods have occurred since 2007 and they have been incorporated into this model to make it more accurate,\" he said.\n\"There has been significant improvement as to modelling methods and guidance since 2007, and the revisions to the Climate Change considerations chapter of Australian Rainfall and Runoff have influenced this model.\"\nThe council was questioned about why the council wouldn't support another independent review of the flood study that affects hundreds of ratepayers.\nBut Mr Coughlan said the flood study - which had done by a qualified consultant in flood modelling - had already been independently reviewed by another consultant the council had separately appointed.\nIt has also been reviewed by Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority and council engineers.",
