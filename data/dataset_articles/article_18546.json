  "text": "The\nCape Cod National Seashore, like many national parks all across the country, is facing staff cuts as the Trump administration fires thousands of federal workers.\nThree full-time workers at the national seashore — the park archeologist, ecologist and the ranger in charge of park outreach — have been fired ahead of the Cape’s busy season as millions of visitors descend upon the region.\nThese three probationary employees are among the 1,000 National Park Service workers who were let go by the Trump administration.\nMeanwhile, there are 10 other vacant positions at the national seashore that likely won’t get filled, and advocates say they’re worried about the ability to hire seasonal staff members.\n“The Friends are deeply concerned about the impact the firings as well as vacant fulltime positions will have on the park, the towns that are part of the park, and the Cape Cod community from the bridges to Provincetown,” the board of\nThe Friends of the Cape Cod National Seashore said in a statement.\n“The unprecedented terminations of staff working for the National Park Service threatens the health and safety of our own beloved National Seashore,” the board added. “The cuts may do great harm to this remarkable natural and cultural resource in the coming months and years, affecting not only the park but also our region.”\nThe National Parks Conservation Association is calling for the 1,000 probationary workers to get their jobs back.\n“This is their dream job,” said Kristen Sykes, the Northeast regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, noting that many of the employees worked for years as seasonal staff at parks all over the country before getting a full-time position.\n“They’re experts in their field, and make sure the parks are protected in perpetuity,” she told the Herald.\nThe advocacy group is also concerned about the parks’ ability to hire seasonal staff, particularly at the Cape.\n“Seasonal workers do so many different jobs, whether it’s cleaning the bathrooms, whether it’s making sure people are safe as lifeguards ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of parkgoers,” Sykes said.\n“We’re really concerned about the lack of staffing, and really for people to be able to have a good experience when they visit our National Parks,” she added.\nA National Park Service spokesperson didn’t comment on the Cape Cod layoffs.\nThe spokesperson in a statement said NPS is hiring seasonal workers to “continue enhancing the visitor experience as we embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation in workforce management.”\n“We are focused on ensuring that every visitor has the chance to explore and connect with the incredible, iconic spaces of our national parks,” the spokesperson added.\nThe Trump administration has been terminating thousands of federal workers.\nThe plan is led by billionaire Elon Musk and the new Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump administration effort to slash federal spending.\nHerald wire services were used in this report.",
