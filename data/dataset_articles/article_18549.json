  "text": "A CORRESPONDENT\nNUMALIGARH: A massive fire broke out in a paddy field in Marangi on Wednesday, engulfing the entire field and spreading panic among the locals. The fire, which is suspected to have been intentionally set by miscreants, quickly spread due to strong winds. According to eyewitnesses, the fire started in the Lurukihat-Dhuliyagaon area of Marangi Mouza and rapidly spread, fuelled by the strong winds. The police and disaster management teams promptly responded to the incident, working to bring the fire under control.\nWhile the cause of the fire is still unknown, it is suspected to be a case of arson. The authorities have launched an investigation into the incident and are working to identify the culprits.
