  "text": "ANNISTON, Ala. ( WBRC ) - City leaders in Anniston say they’ve fined some people for ignoring the city’s burn ban put in place because of the recent drought. That’s after Tuesday night, March 4, when a wildfire burned up to 100-acres at the wildlife oreserve at McClellan Forestry in Anniston.\nJackson Hodges with the City of Anniston says they started notifying neighbors just after 6 p.m. Tuesday night when the big fire began moving towards Veterans Memorial Parkway.\nHodges said Anniston firefighters joined Alabama Forestry Service firefighters to fight the big wildfire on the 900-acre wildlife preserve at McClellan Forestry. He said the fire burned up to 100-acres as crews worked to protect nearby buildings.\nHodges said all the rain Tuesday night helped provide some much needed relief to the dry conditions and exhausted firefighters who answered up to 60 calls this past weekend.\n“It’s a real strain on these men and women and it puts them in danger, and we definitely don’t want that because they do such great work. This situation could’ve gotten out of hand quickly. I think people have seen how it has gotten out of hand in other states across the country and so we’re thankful, we have a top tier rated fire department,” said Hodges.\nHodges said the fire is under investigation while the burn ban in the city remains in place. He says anyone caught burning will be fined.\nGet news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here .\nCopyright 2025 WBRC. All rights reserved.",
