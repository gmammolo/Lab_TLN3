  "text": "The fishing vessel Volition ran aground at Dickinson Point in Bermagui in the early hours of 27 February. Photo: NSW Maritime.\nThe fallout from fishing vessel Volition running aground at Bermagui’s Dickinson Point will likely continue for some time.\nBermagui’s main beach in town, Horseshoe Bay, was closed due to pollution concerns after the boat ran aground in the early hours of 27 February (Thursday).\nDebris in the ocean has washed up on beaches as far north as Camel Rock, and people have reported the strong smell of diesel.\nHorseshoe Bay beach only reopened to the public at 2:15 pm on 4 March (Tuesday) but the cleanup is far from over.\nMarine Rescue and NSW Water Police responded to the mayday call issued from the vessel.\nAll four men on board made it safely back to shore. They are said to be shocked and devastated.\nDeon Voyer, principal manager, Maritime South, Transport for NSW, (NSW Maritime), said it, along with the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and NSW Water Police, were investigating what led the iconic vessel to run aground.\nREAD ALSO Stalling on renewables will see power bills jump this decade, new study shows\nAs of Monday morning, NSW Maritime, the agency responsible for the salvage and clean-up, had collected 10 tonnes of debris – foam, timber and plastics. That included two tonnes of fish waste.\nMr Voyer said the clean-up operation covered 12 lineal kilometres of coastline from Wallaga Lake to Baragoot Beach, south of Bermagui.\nHe said the quantity of diesel that had leaked into the ocean was unknown.\n“The owner reported a maximum of 1000 litres of diesel on board,” Mr Voyer said. “There will also be other hydrocarbons from the deck winches, for example. Being a longliner, not a trawler, there are lower quantities of hydrocarbons.”\nEquipment and vehicles involved in the salvage of fishing vessel Volition on 28 February included a 70-tonne crane.

It is called the free surface effect.\nWhile the vessel is “largely broken up”, the engine, propellors and rear section are submerged behind the reef.\nHe said salvaging those would be complex and would need the right weather and ocean conditions.\n“With Tropical Cyclone Alfred, we are unsure if we can get to that this week,” Mr Voyer said.\nVolition was built in the 1970s, which he said made it difficult to estimate how much debris they would eventually need to recover. Those sections submerged would add a few more tonnes.\nThis is the third grounding that Mr Voyer has worked on in the Bermagui area over the past six or seven years.\nWhen Salvatore V sunk near Haywards Beach in October 2020 that was fairly easy to deal with. “It was broken up and dismantled on the beach.” The clean-up was completed within two weeks.\nIn contrast the salvage operation for Shoalhaven lasted three years.\n“It was in a remote area off Bermagui and required helicopters using winches,” Mr Voyer said. “Because of the location and the seasonal influences, the divers and insurance company were going back for three years.”\nSalvaging the parts of Volition that are submerged behind a reef will be complex and require the right weather and ocean conditions. Photo: NSW Maritime.\nMichael Jubb is a third-generation fisherman. He now owns Bermagui Boat Repairs.\n“Two weeks before the accident, the boat was on the slipway getting maintenance done,” Mr Jubb said.\nHe said Volition had been at sea for maybe four or five days.\nAccording to the Marine Traffic website , Volition left Bermagui just after midnight on 24 February (Monday).\n“The skipper had a fair haul on the boat and would have unloaded and then gone out again because the weather is favourable,” Mr Jubb said.\nREAD ALSO New e-scooter company poised to roll into Canberra, promises fix to e-scooters’ ‘five challenges’\nHe went to Dickinson Point the morning it happened but only stayed a few minutes.\n“Being a boat repairer I could hear the crunching and knew what was happening. I just drove away,” Mr Judd said.\n“It is devastating. A massive, horrible accident. That is all it was.”\nMembers of the public can report any debris or pollution by calling 13 12 36.\nOriginal Article published by Marion Williams on About Regional .",
