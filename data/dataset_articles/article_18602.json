  "text": "Texas dust, tree pollen affecting Oklahoman’s allergies\nDust blowing in from Texas and high winds could mean bad allergies from many across the Sooner state.\nDust blowing in from Texas and high winds could mean bad allergies from many across the Sooner state.\nDust blowing in from Texas and high winds could mean bad allergies from many across the Sooner state.\nDust blowing in from Texas and high winds could mean bad allergies from many across the Sooner state.\nAllergy doctors have said they’re already busy and gave insight into what residents can expect from storm season.\nIf your allergies are acting up right now, you’re not alone, but it may not be from the usual offenders.\nThis week, you may be feeling the effects of dust settling in from Texas.\n“They do come this way, we’ve seen ‘em this weekend and they’re still here somewhat present at this point,” said Dr. Dean Atkinson, with the Oklahoma Allergy and Asthma Clinic.\nA dust cloud that’s traveled across Texas is now hitting Oklahomans. So, what kind of effects will we feel?\n“Anytime we get irritants like dust in the air, it definitely makes symptoms of allergies more severe,” Atkinson said.\nPatients are stacking up and doctors don’t expect that to stop any time soon with storm season pushing pollen around.\n“Pollens actually require wind to keep them up in the air. They’re fairly heavy particles and if they don’t have wind they don’t stay up in the air and that’s one of the reasons why Oklahoma is such a heavy allergy-type environment,” Atkinson said.\nGet the latest news stories of interest by clicking here.\nHigh winds in recent days across Oklahoma aren’t just carrying Texas dust, there are also tree allergens spiking right now.\n“This is the time of year that we typically have a whole lot of elm and cedars also carrying through,” Atkinson said.\nThe advice to avoid symptoms might seem simple, but Atkinson said it’s effective.\n“If you can at all just try to stay away from the outside, especially when it’s real windy like this,” Atkinson said.\nHe also recommends grabbing an over-the-counter antihistamine if you’re having a flare-up.\nTop Headlines",
