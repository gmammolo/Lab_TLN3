  "text": "Kendrapara: Despite a fishing ban, turtles continue to die intermittently at Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary (GMS), world’s largest nesting beach for rare Olive Ridley sea turtles, according to a recent report. The reasons are many, as the globally renowned Gahirmatha has reported the deaths of 197 Olive Ridley turtles in the past four months, according to the latest report by the forest department. The carcasses have been found buried in the sand, though environmentalists fear the actual number of deaths could be much higher. Dead turtles have also been found scattered along the coastline. Despite strict restrictions in the protected zone, illegal incursions by fishing boats and trawlers persist. Authorities have taken action, confiscating 30 boats and arresting 247 fishermen in the past four months. However, the swift release of seized boats and the prompt granting of bail to the accused have undermined the effectiveness of the restrictions, environmentalists say.\nAs a result, the GMS has become an unprotected and dangerous zone for the rare turtles. Nature lover Manoj Kumar Nayak said that the Gahirmatha marine zone has been under a fishing ban from November 2024 to May 2025 to protect the nesting of Olive Ridley turtles. During this period, the forest department, marine police, and the Coast Guard are expected to enforce strict surveillance to ensure marine conservation. However, the unregulated movement of boats and trawlers has led to a significantly higher number of turtle deaths than reported by the forest department. Despite a high court order, most boats and trawlers still do not use turtle excluder devices (TEDs). Additionally, the boats operated by the forest department are mostly underpowered and in poor condition, alleged Nayak. Previously, impounded boats and trawlers were not released until the end of the restricted fishing period.\nHowever, now, seized vessels are being promptly released by the courts, allowing their owners to resume fishing activities, he further said. Prakash Chandra Das, president of the Marine Life Protection Committee, warned that turtle nesting sites are under threat. Coastal erosion continues in islands such as Babubali, Madali, and Ekakula. The Forest Department had planned separate conservation initiatives to protect these eroding coastal areas, but no concrete action has been taken so far, he claimed. Environmentalist Hemant Kumar Rout noted that Olive Ridley turtles used to nest along the Chandrabhaga and Ramachandi coasts. However, due to habitat destruction and illegal fishing activities in trawlers, mass nesting of these turtles has not occurred in the region since 2012.\nAlso Read: Man bludgeoned to death over suspicion of sorcery Given that only one in 1,000 eggs typically survives to adulthood, their protection is crucial. Illegal use of gill nets, unauthorized settlements in the protected Bhitarkanika region, and prawn farming enclosures are further endangering the Olive Ridley population, Rout said. When contacted, Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Manas Kumar Das stated that dedicated surveillance measures are in place. Over the past four months, 30 boats and trawlers, along with 247 unauthorized intruders, have been apprehended. Independent camps and marine patrolling efforts are ongoing in Babubali and Madali islands, with more than 50 personnel deployed around the clock. Forest personnel have collected 255 turtle eggs from sporadic nesting sites, and additional support is expected from the Coast Guard and marine police, he added.",
