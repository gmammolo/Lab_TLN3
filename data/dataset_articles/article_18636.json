  "text": "Severe weather hits Wisconsin’s south shore hard\nIRON RIVER, Wis. (Northern News Now) - Highway 2 in northwest Wisconsin was a mess for much of the day and even closed for a time overnight.\nWhile HWY-2 near Ashland reopened early this morning, travel was downright dangerous there for the first half of Wednesday.\nRELATED: Highway 2 lane closure near Ashland\nThe plows are making good progress now that the snow’s letting up.\nEven longtime South Shore residents who are used to rough weather conditions admit this combo of snow and wind is tough to travel in.\n“It’s just a lot of snow, if you’re not looking at it in-person it probably doesn’t do it justice, cause it’s a lot of snow, we got dumped on pretty good,” Iron River resident Julieanna Middleman said.\nAccording to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, the stretch of HWY-2 from Brule to Ashland is still quite slick in spots, authorities are urging drivers to travel with care.\nClick here to download the Northern News Now app or our Northern News Now First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 Northern News Now.
