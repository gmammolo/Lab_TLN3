  "text": "THE recent rescues of two Asian black bears — Rocky from Jauharabad and Sunny from Jhang — remind us how the horrific practices of bear baiting and dancing bears continue in today’s Pakistan. Rocky, a seven-year-old bear forced into 35 brutal fights, arrived at Islamabad’s Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre with multiple bleeding wounds on his face and back. Meanwhile, three-year-old Sunny was found emaciated, her teeth forcibly removed to render her defenceless, and displaying signs of extreme anxiety — all common in the dancing bear trade. Both animals had nose rings embedded in their sensitive flesh, used to control them through pain and fear. These two traditions — bear baiting, where bears are chained and attacked by dogs for entertainment, and dancing bears, where cubs are tortured into performing unnatural movements — are shameful relics that must be shunned. Despite being illegal for decades, these customs persist in rural areas where law enforcement is scarce and public awareness remains limited.\nWhy are such cruel spectacles so rampant? For one, there is economic desperation among handlers, who keep these animals as a source of income. Then, there is a lack of education about animal welfare. What many fail to recognise is the ecological importance of the Asian black bear, a vulnerable species whose numbers continue to dwindle in Pakistan. Organisations such as Four Paws International deserve commendation for their rescue operations. But individual rescues are not enough. To eradicate these horrible practices permanently, we need strengthened legislation with harsher penalties, expanded resources for wildlife authorities, community education programmes in vulnerable areas, and alternative livelihood options for bear handlers. The removal of Sunny’s nose ring symbolises, as Four Paws’ Dr Khalil noted, “her last dance”. The government must commit to the welfare of these magnificent animals. No bear must be forced to dance or fight again.\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
