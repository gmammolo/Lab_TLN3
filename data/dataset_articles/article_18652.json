  "text": "Radar shows showers and storms moving through our area and out to the northeast. To the west over western Ohio and Indiana, you can see the snow as the cold air wraps around and pushes toward our area Wednesday night. This will take place after midnight as temperatures slowly fall. Little accumulation is expected by Thursday morning, but a slippery morning and day are anticipated on untreated surfaces as temperatures continue to fall. Accumulations during the day of around 1-3″ but winds will be gusty as well creating some blowing snow. The snow will wind down at night and other than another small shot of snow, mainly Friday night, a fairly tranquil weekend is in store.
