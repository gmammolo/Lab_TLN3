  "text": "News\nSurge in California electric vehicle sales could hurt state’s fight against pollution\nCalifornia leaders who want to fight pollution now face a quandary - and it stems, oddly, from the rise of electric cars.\nAs more people buy fuel-efficient or zero-emission vehicles, the public's consumption of gas has declined, and so has the revenue that California draws from gas taxes.\nWhat might seem like environmental progress at first glance has become \"increasingly problematic,\" said Brian Taylor, a professor of urban planning and researcher at UCLA's Institute of Transportation Studies, addressing a committee of state legislators on Monday.\nTaylor and others have laid out the conundrum in stark terms. Gas tax revenues, estimated to be $13.3 billion last year, could fall to as low as $4.8 billion by 2040, according to modeling by the Mineta Transportation Institute in San Jose. That money pays to fix crumbling roads and repair bridges, but it also helps bolster public transit, bicycle infrastructure and other car alternatives that are essential if the state plans to go carbon neutral by 2045.\nAsha Weinstein Agrawal, education director at Mineta, presented the institute's predictions in a series of charts during Monday's joint hearing of the state Assembly and Senate transportation committees. The charts showed how dramatically the state's revenue could fall, depending on how quickly electric vehicles overtake the market.\n\"We are going to lose revenue soon - visibly - within the next few years,\" Agrawal said.\nFor all their benefits, Taylor said at the hearing, electric vehicles still create problems. Equipped with heavy batteries, these fuel-efficient cars and trucks tend to weigh more than their counterparts with internal combustion engines, so they do more damage to roads. They also accelerate more quickly, which increases the risk of collisions, and they contribute to traffic congestion, just like any other vehicles.\nClearly, electric vehicles \"impose costs on society and on the road system,\" Taylor said, but they aren't burdened with the same fuel taxes as gas-powered cars.\nGas taxes serve multiple goals. One is to fund a sprawling, intricate transportation system that requires constant maintenance. Another is to get drivers to pay for use of a precious utility. A third purpose, Taylor said, is to \"influence behavior\": people who drive more, pay more.\nBut the whole calculus fails with the shift to fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\"The way we see it, we're staring both down a steep slope of declining revenues, as well as an absolute cliff,\" said James Corless, executive director of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments.\nHe tried to convey the depth of the state's predicament while acknowledging that it stems, at least partly, from successful efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Not only are people buying electric vehicles; regional planning has made communities more walkable and bikeable, enabling people to travel without driving.\nAgarwal suggested various policy solutions, including new taxes or fees that could hinge on how many miles a driver travels, or how many cars a household owns. She encouraged the state to act soon, given the daunting cost of maintaining a statewide transportation network.\nTanisha Taylor, executive director of the California Transportation Commission, echoed that point. As gas tax money dwindles, she said, counties throughout the state will have fewer funds to pave streets, fix potholes and build bike paths.\nIn a particularly cruel irony, California may even lose money to build zero-emission freight infrastructure, a key component of the effort to go carbon neutral.\nReach Rachel Swan: rswan@sfchronicle.com\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
