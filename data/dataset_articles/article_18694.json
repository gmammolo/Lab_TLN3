  "text": "Eddie Garcia: Dangerous winds returning to New Mexico\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Another round of strong to damaging winds and critical fire weather will develop on Thursday, especially across central and eastern New Mexico. Widespread areas of low visibility in blowing dust will impact much of northern and central New Mexico, and any fires will have the potential to spread rapidly due to the dry and windy conditions.\nLight rain and snow showers will develop in western and northern New Mexico Thursday into Friday before expanding eastward Friday night and early Saturday. Snow accumulations of a couple to a few (2-to-6) inches will be common in the western and northern mountains and surrounding highlands with lesser amounts elsewhere. Wintry travel will impact these higher elevation areas (above 7,000 feet).\nDry and tranquil weather will prevail Sunday and Monday, but another windy day is forecast on Tuesday of next week with more critical fire weather in central and eastern areas that will remain dry.\nChief meteorologist Eddie Garcia has your full forecast in the video above.",
