  "text": "The rising temperatures are linked to a low-pressure system dominating Thailand’s atmosphere, combined with moist air currents from the Gulf of Thailand, which will increase humidity and intensify the heat. PATTAYA, Thailand – Experts have warned Thailand could experience extreme heat in April, with temperatures expected to reach 44 degrees Celsius (°C) in some regions. Forecasts from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Thai Meteorological Department indicate that April 2025 will be the hottest month of the year. Bangkok may see daytime temperatures averaging 35 °C, while northern provinces such as Mae Hong Son, Tak, Chiang Mai, Lampang, Uttaradit, Loei, and Sukhothai could endure maximum temperatures of 42–44 °C, especially in basin-like areas that trap heat.\nThe rising temperatures are linked to a low-pressure system dominating Thailand’s atmosphere, combined with moist air currents from the Gulf of Thailand, which will increase humidity and intensify the heat. Climate data suggests that 2025 could be Thailand’s third-hottest year in seven decades, following record-breaking temperatures in 2024 and 2023. In April 2024, Lampang recorded 44.6 °C, while several provinces exceeded 44 °C during the summer.\nLong-term climate trends indicate that extreme heat events will become more frequent due to global warming. Rising greenhouse gas emissions have already pushed global temperatures 1.5 °C higher than pre-industrial levels. Countries in tropical and equatorial regions, including Thailand, are expected to face summer temperatures exceeding 44 °C annually, with heatwaves growing more intense over time.\nHealth officials have warned of increased risks of heat-related illnesses, including heatstroke, which occurs when body temperatures rise above 40 °C. Symptoms can include severe fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps, seizures, and, in extreme cases, organ failure.\nWith extreme heat becoming a recurring challenge, authorities stress the importance of public awareness and adaptive measures to protect public health. Precautionary steps such as wearing breathable clothing, drinking sufficient water, and limiting outdoor exposure will be crucial in mitigating the effects of rising temperatures. (NNT)",
