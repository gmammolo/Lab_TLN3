  "text": "Beware Of This Deadly Plant Blooming All Over PA\nSpring will be on its way soon in Pennsylvania and it’s a really great time of year.\nThe winter weather will slowly phase out, people will start being social and you don’t have to bundle up in layers just to run to the grocery store.\nIt’s something I feel we take for granted during the colder months and personally I can’t wait any longer!\nRead More: Here’s Where You’ll Wait for the Longest at a PA DMV\nSomething that makes Spring so special is all of the beautiful blooming trees and flowers that pop up everywhere.\nAlso, the air gets to a beautiful 65-75 degrees and it’s just an amazing time of year. While there is so much to look forward to about Spring and Summer, of course, there are some negative things too.\nThere are actually a ton of dangerous plants that spread up in Pennsylvania during the springtime that you need to look out for when you’re out and about over the next few months.\nThere are some really dangerous plants that call Pennsylvania home during the warmer months that you need to be on the lookout for this Spring/Summer.\nWhat Is The Most Poisonous Flower in Pennsylvania?\nPoison Hemlock is a highly dangerous yet common plant that you'll find all over Pennsylvania.\nThe plant can grow up to 6 feet in size and can even be fatal if swallowed.\nIf you go hiking, camping, or just spend a lot of time outside, you need to know what this plant looks like.\nIt can cause rashes on the skin if touched, but if swallowed it could be deadly so make sure you’re careful out there!\nIt has white flowers that bloom from June to August and you can even see red or purplish spots on the stem. Make sure to stay away from these plants!\nThese are the Best Pennsylvania Companies to Work For\nBest Employers By State2024, put together with market research firm Statista. Employees were surveyed about their own companies of 500 or more, plus places worked recently. Pennsylvania had a GREAT showing on the list with a total of 41 companies making the top 100. In fact, 15 of the top 50 employers in the US are headquartered in Pa.\nGallery Credit: Joe, 94.5 PST\nTop 16 Friendliest Places to Live in Pennsylvania\nnew report issued by Nextdoor.com.\nGallery Credit: Joe, 94.5 PST",
