  "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) – Rain and snowmelt will cause sharp rises on rivers, creeks and streams Wednesday night and Thursday. Several rivers are forecast to get close to, but stay below flood stage unless there is an ice jam. We are not expecting widespread problems, but there could be an ice jam or two. If one forms, any river or stream could quickly rise above flood stage.\nIce jams happen when ice breaks up into chunks that clump together and block the river from flowing properly.\nThe risk for ice jams will be greatest from late Wednesday night through Thursday. Steady rain will continue tonight, but the bulk of it will be done by morning. Mild temperatures will allow the threat for ice jams to continue into the afternoon. Temperatures fall sharply Thursday evening, ending the risk for flooding.\nThe tricky thing about ice jams is we know conditions are favorable for river ice movement, but it’s impossible to know ahead of time if any given location will be impacted. If you live along a river, be prepared in case one forms.\nThree rivers in our area are forecast to get close to flood stage even without an ice jam: the Mad River, The Ausable River and the Otter Creek. A jam would push levels even higher. The Winooski River is no longer forecast to reach flood stage unless there is an ice jam.\nThe Mad River near Moretown is forecast to crest just below minor flood stage Thursday morning. The Ausable River near Au Sable Forks is expected to crest Thursday afternoon. The Otter Creek at Center Rutland will likely crest a little later Thursday evening or early Friday morning.\nDownload the First Alert Weather App so you can be the first to know if a flood warning is issued for your area. Make sure you turn on station notifications in the app settings menu and toggle on flood alerts to receive push notifications.",
