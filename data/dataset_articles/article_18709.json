  "text": "Living\nReport: 7,000 gallons of hydrocarbon materials released in Martinez Feb. 1 blaze\nMARTINEZ - A massive fire that broke out at a refinery last month released more than 7,000 gallons of hydrocarbon materials into the air and required medical treatment for six workers, according to the 30-day report the company sent to Contra Costa Health Services officials.\nThe Martinez Refining Company posted the report on social media Tuesday. They said they submitted it to county officials on Feb. 28.\nThe report said the six refinery workers were evaluated by medical personnel and released. None of them went to a hospital.\nIn the report, the refinery said it estimated that 170 barrels - 7,140 gallons - of hydrocarbons were released in the Feb. 1 blaze. An explosion and fire were reported at the refinery about 1:30 p.m. as two workers prepared to do planned maintenance on a process unit.\nThe blaze caused Bay Area gas prices to rise in the immediate aftermath.\nThe company reported that the hydrocarbons released were light cat cracked naphtha, light cat cracked distillates; intermediate cat cracked distillates; light thermal cracked naphtha; and isobutane-rich C3-C4.\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, exposure to hydrocarbons can increase the risk of certain types of cancers.\nThe MRC wrote that its best estimate indicated 30 combined barrels (1,260 gallons) of the light thermal cracked naphtha and the isobutane-rich C3-C4; 20 combined barrels (840 gallons) of the light cat cracked naphtha and light cat cracked distillates; and 120 barrels (5,040 gallons) of the intermediate cat cracked distillates were released.\nThe company also said they believe that Diethanolamine likely was released because of a ruptured pipe caused by the fire. That chemical is used in cosmetics, detergents and pharmaceuticals, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nFlaring that was needed for safety workers to respond to the unplanned shut down of the refinery also caused more than 500 pounds of sulfur dioxide to be released, the company said.\nThe refinery said its operating units are still shut down, and that it is still assessing damage from the fire. They did not have an estimate for when the operating units would open again.\nThe report follows the initial 72-hour report that the company issued immediately after the fire. The MRC is owned by PBF Energy, Inc.\nThe city of Benicia is also having its own troubles recently with a refinery as Valero informed the Benicia Fire Department on Tuesday that there is an issue with one of their tanks causing an odor in the area.\nBenicia firefighters were dispatched to test various spots in the city on Tuesday with high quality portable air monitors. The department and staff said it will continue to monitor the situation, but said on social media that on air monitor readings, it currently does not anticipate any off-site health impacts.\nThe department said it's \"understanding is that the odor was from crude oil. At the time of the odor, hydrogen sulfide was detected but at low levels, below levels which would cause adverse health effects per the Bay Area Air Quality Management District and the California Air Resources Board.\"\nThe Valero Refinery has been the site of a series of air pollution incidents, including the recent revelation that a hydrogen vent at the refinery had been leaking 2.7 tons of toxics into the air for 15 years. That discovery resulted in an historic $84 million fine imposed by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (an oversight agency) in 2024.\nBenicia is currently the only Bay Area refinery town to not yet have an Industrial Safety Ordinance, although it is working on getting one. Community activists - including health and environmental advocates - have spent years calling for tighter regulations to protect citizens from dangerous industrial emissions impacting air quality and the health of residents.\nOriginally Published: March 5, 2025 at 11:59 AM PST\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
