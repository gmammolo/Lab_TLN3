  "text": "While Tropical Cyclone Alfred has slowed down, it could still bring life-threatening impacts.\nThe category 2 cyclone is set to hit south-east Queensland and northern NSW's coastlines at around midday on Saturday with damaging winds, flash flooding, and dangerous storm tides predicted.\nHowever, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) now forecasts the cyclone will have downgraded to a category 1 system by the time it crosses onto the mainland.\nHere's the latest on what you can expect from Cyclone Alfred today, tomorrow, and this weekend.\nWhen will Cyclone Alfred hit? It's estimated that Cyclone Alfred will hit the coastline about a day later than originally forecast, and is expected to cross the coast at about 12pm AEST (1pm AEDT) on Saturday, most likely between Noosa and Coolangatta.\nThe BoM's latest update has pushed the cyclone's arrival back by about a day, with original forecast saying it would hit the coast overnight on Thursday and into Friday morning.\nThe latest predicted path of Cyclone Alfred Credit: Bureau of Meteorology In the BoM's latest update, Alfred will hit coastal areas from Double Island Point in Queensland to east of Grafton in NSW, including Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Byron Bay and Ballina.\nThe town of Grafton itself is expected to lie outside the cyclone's path.\nHow severe will Cyclone Alfred be? Alfred is expected weaken to a category 1 storm before making landfall, BoM announced late on Friday morning.\nBoM Brisbane manager Matthew Collopy said this meant that \"destructive winds are unlikely for Brisbane itself\", but added that \"damaging wind gusts up to 120km/h are expected, and they will develop quickly as the system approaches\".\nAccording to the BoM, category 1 cyclones have damaging winds and generally cause \"negligible house damage\" and \"damage to some crops, trees and caravans\".\nThey have maximum average wind speeds of between 63–88 km/h, with strongest winds of up to 125 km/h.\nREAD MORE The Albanese factor behind Tropical Cyclone Alfred's last-minute name change\nHowever, a cyclone's ranking doesn't take into account the severe flood risk that comes with heavy rain and storm surges, which could be incredibly destructive.\nFederal Emergency Management Minister Jenny McAllister said earlier on Friday at \"all of our advice essentially to communities remains the same — this is a significant weather system.\"\n\"There are preparations that we need you to undertake now and it is a time when we need you to take care of your friends and families and listen to the guidance from authorities,\" she told ABC News Breakfast.\n\"If anything, what I'd say to communities today is that the uncertainty about the window at which the cyclone will cross remains. We do need people to be alert, to be listening to emergency broadcasts, to be checking the apps, and just keeping themselves informed of the risks that might confront them over the course of the week.\"\nREAD MORE Queensland faces Alfred's 'second phase', as Lismore braces for 'entirely different game'\nAlfred slowing doesn't mean it won't intensify At a Canberra press conference on Friday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said while the cyclone had slowed down, it didn't mean it would be a less intense one.\n\"We absolutely need to prepare for the worst,\" he said.\n\"This is already having an impact, and the impact with the slowing of the Cyclone Alfred in its journey westward to the coast, we should not think that slower means better.\"\n\"It's not clear that it could intensify as well as it is over warmer waters. It has the potential to increase the intensity of it.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said while the cyclone has slowed down, it didn't mean it would be less intense. Source: AAP / Lukas Coch What's the latest BoM forecast Things are changing quickly in south-east Queensland and northern NSW, but based on current BoM forecasts:\nRainfall, flooding and surf conditions: Heavy to locally intense rainfall, which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is likely to develop from Friday afternoon and continue near and south of the system centre during the weekend. Separate Severe Weather Warning, Flood Watches, and Flood Warnings are current for southeast Queensland and northeast NSW. Abnormally high tides are likely to continue causing minor flooding of coastal low lying areas between Double Island Point and Ballina, particularly during the high tide, which will peak early on Saturday. Damaging surf leading to significant beach erosion remains likely for the open beaches between Double Island Point and Grafton, and further south over the NSW coast. READ MORE What airlines are offering travellers as Tropical Cyclone Alfred sparks cancellations\nWild wind: Gales with damaging wind gusts of up to 120 kilometres per hour are occurring near the coast between Cape Moreton and Yamba and are expected to extend along the remaining southeast Queensland and northeastern NSW coastal and island communities between Noosa and Yamba later today as Alfred approaches the coast. These winds may extend as far south as Grafton and northwards to Double Island Point in the evening or Saturday morning. Destructive wind gusts of up to 155 kilometres per hour may develop about the Moreton Bay Islands and exposed coastal location on the northern Gold Coast from tonight, as Alfred's destructive core approaches the coast. The destructive winds may persist until Alfred crosses the coast early Saturday morning. Although Alfred is expected to weaken and move inland during Saturday, damaging wind gusts may continue, particularly over elevated terrain during Saturday, before easing throughout during Sunday.",
