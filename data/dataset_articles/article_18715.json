  "text": "Nauru, a small island in the Pacific, has implemented an unpublished strategy to face the threats derived from climate change. Faced with the growing threat of the increase in sea level, which endangers the habitability of its territory, the country has decided to launch a gold passport program. Through this measure, it seeks to obtain the necessary resources to relocate its population in safer areas, protecting their future against climatic consequences.\nThis measure, taken in response to an existential crisis, underlines how island countries are forced to adopt innovative solutions due to the effects of global warming. Without the necessary resources to counteract these impacts, small nations are forced to explore out of common alternatives to guarantee the survival of its inhabitants.\nYou can see: NASA reveals the only country in South America that would be uninhabitable in 2050 due to lethal temperatures and climate collapse\nWhat is a golden passport and how does it work? The golden passport is a mechanism by which individuals can obtain citizenship in exchange for a significant economic investment. In this case, the initial cost of the citizenship of Nauru is US $ 105,000. This citizenship grants access without visa to countries such as the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.\nAlthough golden passports have been controversial due to their use in situations of high risk and illegal activities, this country has decided to use them to finance their fight against climate change. The income generated by the program will be used to create a plan to relocate 90% of its population in higher and protected areas of climatic threats.\nYou can see: the surprising finding about the ‘memory’ of the trees that affects their survival\nWhy has this country resorted to the sale of citizenship? Nauru faces a serious climate threat, with the increase in sea level, which would be a direct danger to its inhabitants. With just 20 square kilometers, the island is seeing how its lands are invaded by the waters, which affects both the infrastructure and the life of the 12,500 inhabitants. The exploitation of phosphate, which was the main source of income for decades, has left areas of uninhabitable island, which further complicates the situation.\nThe president of the nation, David Adeang, told CNN that, “while the world debates climate action, we must take proactive measures to ensure the future of our nation.” This statement underlines the urgency with which the country must act to guarantee the survival of its population, given the lack of external resources and support.\nHow will the income of the sale of citizenship be used? The funds raised with the sale of citizenship will be used to finance a relocation plan, which will involve transferring a large part of the population to safer areas and less vulnerable to the increase in sea level. The program is expected to generate approximately US $ 5.6 million in the first year, with a long -term projection of reaching US $ 42 million annually. This amount represents a significant percentage of government income, since the program is expected to cover about 19% of the total budget.\nDespite the risks associated with gold passports, this strategy highlights how the countries most vulnerable to climate change are taking innovative measures to obtain financing. Experts such as Kirstin Surak, associate professor of political sociology at the London School of Economics, have highlighted the importance of ensuring that these funds are used transparently and with adequate control to avoid possible abuse.",
