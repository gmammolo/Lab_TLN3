  "text": "Gusty winds cause scattered power outages around Greater Cincinnati\nCincinnati homes, businesses and traffic lights all went dark Wednesday\nCincinnati homes, businesses and traffic lights all went dark Wednesday\nCincinnati homes, businesses and traffic lights all went dark Wednesday\nAs the cold front moved in, many across our region saw, heard and felt the impacts of the heavy winds.\nFor thousands, it meant losing power and waiting for Duke Energy crews to get the lights and heat back on.\nPower was out for people in Bridgetown on the West Side for hours. Then, inside Ideal Baseball Cards the lights flickered back.\n\"Popped right back on. You guys are a lucky charm,\" Owner Mike Siska said.\nThey could not use credit cards without power, instead only cash and Venmo. And when they've lost power in the past, Siska lights up candles, a solution as classic as the Big Red Machine baseball cards in their glass displays.\n\"I would have a few boxes of these around the shop; people would come in, they could see a little bit,\" Siska said.\nBut tonight, after the sun set and temps plummeted, hundreds in Anderson Township were left in the dark and without heat since 3:30 in the afternoon.\n\"Dog walks, temperature dropping. It's not much colder inside than it is outside,\" one man said. \"Basically, it'll be cuddling up with the dog in bed and putting an extra blanket on the bed.\"\nAs Duke crews work to get it restored, he learned his mom's also in the dark and cold.\n\"Yeah, I actually grew up right across the street, couple blocks down there, and she just called me before I walked out with my dog and said her power just went out, too. Looks like now the outage has expanded,\" he said. \"Hopefully, it bounces right back, and then we're just looking forward to the spring weather coming.\"\nPower in Anderson Township has since been restored.",
