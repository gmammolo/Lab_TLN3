  "text": "Emergency crews across the New England North West are ready to respond as Tropical Cyclone Alfred inches closer to making landfall.\nFire and Rescue NSW Zone Commander Tom Cooper has left his Tamworth headquarters to provide operational support at a multi-agency regional emergency operations centre at Coffs Harbour Police Station.\n\"There's police, rural fire service, SES, marine rescue, Department of Commerce engineers, recovery authority, everybody's here,\" Superintendent Cooper told the Leader.\nThe multi-agency operations team will coordinate the response to the cyclone expected to make landfall in southeast Queensland on Friday or early Saturday.\nMeanwhile, back in Tamworth, a Fire and Rescue strike team is on standby, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.\nThe team on standby consists of four tankers, 16 firefighters, and a taskforce commander.\n\"A lot of people have been messaging me asking how bad is it and what's going to happen, and no one knows. A cyclone like this is pretty unpredictable, and it is a big one,\" Superintendent Cooper said\n\"As for myself, I'm feeling that I'll be able to deal with anything that happens. You just gotta rely on your experience and procedures and see what develops.\"\nCloser to home, several community organisations are also keeping a close eye on how Cyclone Alfred develops.\nThe Armidale Show and the Barraba Show are both setting up to run this weekend, rain or shine.\nThe Armidale Show has cancelled its show jumping event due to strong winds forecast for the area but will otherwise plough ahead as normal.\nMeanwhile, the Moonbi Showground is preparing for the 2025 Moonbi Kootingal Motor and Historical Machinery Exhibition, though organisers say if there's a lot of rain, the event will be cancelled.\nThe Kootingal Motor Club encourages motoring enthusiasts to watch its social media for updates.\nAt the time of publication, Tamworth was forecast to receive up to 4mm of rain on Saturday and 30mm on Sunday.\nBut tropical cyclones are difficult to predict, so the local SES is getting prepared for all possibilities.\n\"We're setting up an incident management team here in Tamworth as well, and have crews on standby along the Northern Tablelands as they're anticipating heavy rain into the weekend,\" NSW SES Deputy Zone Commander Matthew Kirby said.\n\"We're not sending any crews to the coast due to the risk we have [here], but the coast has resources from across all of NSW to support operations there.\"\nSuperintendent Kirby says the SES is also sending crews from Sydney to assist the Northern Tablelands and advises residents to exercise caution.\n\"Stay out of floodwater. Don't attempt to drive or walk through floodwater,\" he said.\n\"Prepare your home now while conditions are benign, and monitor conditions via the SES website and the Hazards Near Me app.\"",
