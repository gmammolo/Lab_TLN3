  "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) – The logging industry and sawmills are disappearing in Vermont.\nAlong with shrinking markets and a warming climate, Vermont’s forests and the people whose livelihoods depend on them face compounding threats: a fast-aging workforce, fragmentation of forests into smaller parcels, declining appetite among landowners for selling timber, and rising public skepticism about harvesting on public lands.\nCat Viglienzoni spoke with Seven Days’s Jonathan Mingle, who wrote in this week’s issue about why the trends are bad news for forests.\n.",
