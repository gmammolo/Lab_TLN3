  "text": "Northeast Japan wildfires still not under control after 1st rain since outbreak\n(Mainichi Japan)\nTOKYO -- The first rain fell March 5 since massive forest fires broke out Feb. 26 in the northeastern Japan city of Ofunato, Iwate Prefecture. However, the situation cannot yet be declared completely under control.\nAccording to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), Ofunato experienced rainfall ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 millimeters per hour from the morning to the afternoon of March 5. This amount does not qualify as heavy rain.\nThe Fire and Disaster Management Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications noted that with forest fires, even if the flames appear to be extinguished, the water may not penetrate the grass and fallen leaves beneath large trees, allowing flames to smolder and smoke to reappear after some time.\nMoreover, when trees are in full leaf, even a reasonable amount of rain might be absorbed by the leaves and not reach the ground. Therefore, the decision to declare that the fires had ended in forested areas apparently requires more careful consideration compared to urban fires.\nA spokesperson explained, \"Even if we think we have used a significant amount of water during firefighting efforts and it has rained, it is common for the water not to have penetrated the undergrowth. This time, the area that needs to be checked is extensive, so it will take considerable time to decide if the fire has stopped.\"\nThe JMA forecasts continued rain along the coast of Iwate Prefecture on March 6. However, the weather on March 7 is expected to be \"cloudy with occasional sunshine,\" raising the possibility of renewed fires and dry conditions.\n(Japanese original by Shinji Kurokawa, Tokyo City News Department)",
