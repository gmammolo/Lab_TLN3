M Abdul Rabi Updated on: 06 Mar 2025, 3:52 am 2 min read\nCopied\nKANNIYAKUMARI: Farmers opposed taking water from the Pechiparai and Perunchani dams through the Ananthanar Channel to Nagercoil Municipal Corporation.\nMukkadal dam, which is the main drinking water source of Nagercoil Municipal Corporation, has nearly dried up. The water level of the dam stood at 1.6 feet against its total capacity of 25 feet.\nBesides, the municipal corporation is taking water from the Puthen Dam Drinking Water Scheme. As the municipal authorities are allegedly planning to take water through Ananthanar channel, farmers opposed it.\nKodayar Basin Irrigation System Project Committee Chairman and Farmer A Wins Anto told TNIE that the Nagercoil Municipal Corporation had been taking water from Mukkadal Dam. Besides, it was taking water through the Puthen Water Scheme from the Pechiparai and Perunchani Dam’s water. Now they were allegedly planning to take the dam’s water through Ananthanar Channel near Mukkadal Dam for drinking water needs.\nHe added that the water levels of Pechiparai and Perunchani dams have been decreasing, and this move would rapidly decrease the water levels, meant only for irrigation. If the rains fail, farmers could not go for cultivation in the ensuing season.\nAnto added that Nagercoil Municipal Corporation had been taking water from the Anthanar Channel for drinking water needs for many years. As drinking water is drawn through Puthen Dam Drinking Water Scheme, water should not be taken from Ananthanar channel.\nA farmer functionary S Thanu Pillai said that instead of taking water from dams meant only for irrigation, the municipal corporation authorities should take measures for taking water from Ulakkai Aruvi.\nAlong with other famers, they submitted a petition to the district collector, Nagercoil Municipal Corporation Commissioner and Water Resources Department Executive Engineer on Wednesday.\nNagercoil municipal corporation sources said that they were drawing 41 MLD water from Puthen dam drinking water scheme and 3. 5 MLD water from Mukkadal dam as the city needs 45 MLD water.\nBefore Puthen dam water scheme was implemented, the municipal corporation was taking Ananthanar channel water near the Mukkadal dam, when required.\nWhen contacted, a senior water resources department official said that we would scrutinize the grievances of farmers by considering the water needs for irrigation and drinking water needs.",
