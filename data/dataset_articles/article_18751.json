(it) argues that the Province could have required other language in the forest Stewardship Plan before approving it if the Province wanted an express limit on incursions,\" the decision read. Interfor claimed it followed the rules and had done nothing wrong.\nHowever, the Forrest Appeal Commission disagreed.\nREAD MORE: Two BC realtors fined total of $12,000 for breaking advertising rules\n\"We find Interfor did not act in a manner consistent with the limitations on how and why Old Growth Management Areas harvesting could occur,\" the decision reads. \"The Panel finds that the planning and harvesting of Old Growth Management Areas for all eight of the impugned cutblocks went beyond what we consider to be modifications to the boundaries between non-Old Growth Management Areas lands and the Old Growth Management Areas.\"\nThe Forest Appeal Commission was also critical of paperwork the company said it no longer had, pointed out it offered no \"satisfactory explanation\" as to why this documentation wasn't available, while other paperwork from the same time period was.\n\"We find that Interfor knew or ought to have known to preserve any documents which may have existed,\" the decision read.\nWhile Interfor wanted the penalty dropped to $5,000 per infraction, the Forest Appeal Commission settled on $35,000.\nThe company will now have to pay $280,000.\nTo contact a reporter for this story, email Ben Bulmer or call (250) 309-5230 or email the editor.
