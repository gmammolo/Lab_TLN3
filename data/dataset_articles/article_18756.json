  "text": "Dhaka, the densely populated capital of Bangladesh, recorded an AQI score of 157 this morning (March 6, 2025), securing the sixth spot among cities with the worst air quality worldwide.\nToday’s air was classified as ‘unhealthy’, referring to a health threat to residents, according to the AQI index.\nWhen the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered ‘moderate’, usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, between 150 and 200 is ‘unhealthy’, between 201 and 300 is said to be 'very unhealthy', while a reading of 301+ is considered 'hazardous', posing serious health risks to residents.\nPakistan’s Lahore, Poland’s Wroclaw and Indonesia’s Jakarta respectively occupied the first, second and third positions on the list, with AQI scores of 176, 171, and 170 respectively.\nScientists raise concerns as the US stops sharing air quality data\nThe AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them.\nThe AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and ozone.\nDhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon.\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.",
