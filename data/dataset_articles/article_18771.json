  "text": "6th March 2025 – (Hong Kong) As of 8.57am today, the Hong Kong Observatory reported that the northeast monsoon is impacting the southern coast of China. A broad band of clouds is also delivering sporadic rain patches to Guangdong. This morning, urban areas in Hong Kong experienced notably cool conditions, while the New Territories felt cold, with temperatures dropping to 12 degrees Celsius or lower across many locations. Further declines in temperature are anticipated tonight and tomorrow morning.\nThe current weather situation indicates that temperatures in Hong Kong are approximately six degrees lower than yesterday. The forecast for today predicts cloudy skies with occasional rain patches. Daytime temperatures are expected to hover around 15 degrees, with a further drop anticipated overnight. Winds are moderate to fresh, blowing from the north to northeast, occasionally strengthening offshore and in elevated areas.\nLooking ahead, a few rain patches are expected tomorrow, with minimum temperatures in urban areas around 13 degrees, while the New Territories will remain cold. Gradual warming is forecast for the weekend into early next week, with clearer conditions anticipated.\nThe northeast monsoon is set to persist over Guangdong today and tomorrow, contributing to progressively lower temperatures across the region. As the monsoon transitions to an easterly airstream, the band of clouds affecting Guangdong will begin to thin, leading to a rise in temperatures and brighter weather by early next week. Midweek conditions are expected to shift again, with a maritime airstream bringing humid and foggy weather to the coastal areas. Residents are advised to stay alert to weather changes, keep warm, and look after the elderly and those with chronic health conditions.\nSource: Hong Kong Observatory",
