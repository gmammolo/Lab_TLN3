  "text": "Cocke Co. family ‘overlooked’ after missing out on funding following Helene\nShannon’s Gardens saw significant damage more than five months ago during Hurricane Helene.\nNEWPORT, Tenn. (WVLT) - Along Highway 73 in Newport, a small business is struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\nShannon’s Gardens has been operating now for more than four years, farming and selling goods to people across East Tennessee. On Sept. 27, Helene devastated the garden and wiped out multiple structures on the property, and damaged the greenhouse in the process.\n“It was well beyond what I imagined even watching the water rise all day,” said owner David Shannon.\nAccording to Cocke County Property Assessor Macie Reed, they had until the end of January to submit their assessment of damaged homes and businesses that would qualify to get 130% of their property taxes back.\nWhile Shannon’s Gardens was eventually marked and counted as damaged property, it was done so by county leaders after the deadline, which means that Shannon won’t be included in this round of funding.\nReed said that Shannon’s Garden was simply missed while a team of two people tried to cover an entire county’s worth of damage. In a short period of time, they were able to mark over 1,000 properties but did admittedly miss a few. Reed said that she believes there’s a bill that’s currently being discussed by state leaders that would directly help people like Shannon who weren’t included in this most recent reimbursement.\n“Everybody’s been forgotten. I know it’s a slow process, but it’s been over 5 months now, and it doesn’t take long to get people help,” said Shannon.\nIf you believe your home, business, or property is eligible for funding, you’re asked to reach out to the Cocke County Property Assessor’s Office.\nCopyright 2025 WVLT.
