  "text": "Homeowners on the Hawke’s Bay coast are bracing for a rough night as large swells pound the shoreline due to a low-pressure system to the east of the North Island.\nMetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said a combination of the swell generated around the low-pressure system and strong southerly winds creating wind waves on top of the swell are causing treacherous conditions.\n“We’re seeing those waves for the rest of [Thursday] and it looks like the highest waves we’re expecting are ... a couple of hours around high tide [at 12.15am Friday],” she said.\nFollowing high tide, the waves should slowly start to ease off into Friday afternoon and going into Saturday.",
