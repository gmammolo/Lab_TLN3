  "text": "The main bus stop in Banz, North Waghi district, Jiwaka Province, has become a significant public health concern due to accumulated garbage.\nResidents attribute the problem to the “negligence” of responsible authorities.\nThe once-busy hub, known as a mini-township, now presents an “eyesore” to the public. Immediate action is demanded to address the escalating sanitation issue.\nMore on this story in tomorrow’s Post-Courier.",
