  "text": "By Stefan J. Bos, Chief International Correspondent Worthy News\nJAKARTA ( Worthy News ) – Indonesia’s authorities struggle to contain flooding in the capital, Jakarta, and surrounding areas that killed at least one person and displaced thousands.\nDesperate authorities are using cloud seeding, which involves releasing salt or other chemicals into clouds to trigger rain.\nOfficials hope to steer rainfall away from flood-hit areas or limit the formation of heavier downpours.\nThe deluge began on Monday and has affected Jakarta, home to about 11 million people, along with the neighboring cities of Bogor, Bekasi, and Tangerang.\nNewly elected officials and first responders scrambled to deal with what they called “one of the worst floods” in recent years.\nAt least 140 homes have been submerged in floodwaters as high as three meters (9 feet), according to authorities.\nRoughly 2,200 people were displaced, some seeking safety on rooftops or using ropes to wade through the rising waters. Yet reports of at least one death underscored the dangers people face.\nRUBBER BOATS\nRescue teams deployed rubber boats and relief supplies to the worst-hit areas, evacuating residents or assisting those reluctant to leave their homes.\nIn some areas, authorities said they cut off power to prevent people from being electrocuted by the rising water.\nOfficials warned the rains could persist until March 11 and have taken preemptive measures to reduce further damage.\nA cloud seeding operation was due to continue until Saturday. It focused on mountainous areas in West Java province, where rainfall often flows into the capital.\n“We can’t prevent the rain, that’s impossible, but we can reduce the intensity,” Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia’s weather agency, told reporters on Tuesday. “We can’t let the clouds get too big, so we will make it come down little by little.”\nJakarta, a low-lying city, is prone to flooding during the wet season, which lasts from November to March.\nIn 2020, torrential rains triggered devastating floods and landslides in the region, killing nearly 70 people and displacing thousands.\nThe government has been pressured to improve water management and infrastructure in areas such as Jakarta.",
