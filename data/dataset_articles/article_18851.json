  "text": "Australia Cyclone\n- Lukas Coch - AAP IMAGE\n- Updated\nAs featured on\nSchools are closed, public transport has stopped and desperate householders are getting around shortages of sandbags by buying sacks of potting mix as a region of eastern Australia is lashed by wind and rain from a rare approaching tropical cyclone.Bureau of Meteorology on Thursday forecast Tropical Cyclone Alfred will cross the Queensland state coast somewhere between the Sunshine Coast region and the city of Gold Coast to the south early Saturday.Between the two tourist strips is the state capital Brisbane, Australia’s third-most populous city which will host the 2032 Olympic games.Alfred is expected to become the first cyclone to cross the coast near Brisbane since Cyclone Zoe hit Gold Coast in 1974 and brought widespread flooding.\nNot home to watch today's news?
