From a report: The researchers said the 2023 data strengthened the case for holding fossil fuel companies to account for their contribution to global heating. Previous versions of the annual report have been used in legal cases against companies and investors. The report found that the 36 major fossil fuel companies, including Saudi Aramco, Coal India, ExxonMobil, Shell and numerous Chinese companies, produced coal, oil and gas responsible for more than 20bn tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2023. If Saudi Aramco was a country, it would be the fourth biggest polluter in the world after China, the US and India, while ExxonMobil is responsible for about the same emissions as Germany, the world's ninth biggest polluter, according to the data. Global emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 if the world is to have a good chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, the internationally agreed target. However, emissions are still rising, supercharging the extreme weather that is taking lives and livelihoods across the planet. The International Energy Agency has said new fossil fuel projects started after 2021 are incompatible with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Most of the 169 companies in the Carbon Majors database increased their emissions in 2023, which was the hottest year on record at the time.Read more of this story at Slashdot.\nClick here to read full news..\nAll Channels\nNigerian Dailies:\nPunch\n|\nVanguard\n|\nThe Nation\n|\nThisday\n|\nDaily Sun\n|\nGuardian\n|\nDaily Times\n|\nDaily Trust\n|\nDaily Independent\n|\nThe Herald\n|\nTribune\n|\nLeadership\n|\nNational Mirror\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nNew Telegraph\n|\nPeoples Daily\n|\nBlueprint\n|\nNigerian Pilot\n|\nSahara Reporters\n|\nPremium Times\n|\nThe Cable\n|\nPM News\n|\nAPO Africa Newsroom\nCategories Today:\nWorld\n|\nSports\n|\nTechnology\n|\nEntertainment\n|\nBusiness\n|\nPolitics\n|\nColumns\n|\nAll Headlines Today\nEntertainment (Local):\nLinda Ikeji\n|\nBella Naija\n|\nTori\n|\nDaily News 24\n|\nPulse\n|\nThe NET\n|\nDailyPost\n|\nInformation Nigeria\n|\nGistlover\n|\nLailas Blog\n|\nMiss Petite\n|\nOlufamous\n|\nStella Dimoko Korkus Blog\n|\nYnaija\n|\nAll Entertainment News Today\nEntertainment (World):\nTMZ\n|\nDaily Mail\n|\nHuffington Post\nSports:\nGoal\n|\nAfrican Football\n|\nBleacher Report\n|\nFTBpro\n|\nKickoff\n|\nAll Sports Headlines Today\nBusiness & Finance:\nNairametrics\n|\nNigerian Tenders\n|\nBusiness Insider\n|\nForbes\n|\nEntrepreneur\n|\nThe Economist\n|\nBusinessTech\n|\nFinancial Watch\n|\nBusinessDay\n|\nAll Business News Headlines Today\nTechnology (Local):\nTechpoint\n|\nTechMoran\n|\nTechCity\n|\nInnovation Village\n|\nIT News Africa\n|\nTechnology Times\n|\nTechnext\n|\nTechcabal\n|\nAll Technology News Headlines Today\nTechnology (World):\nTechcrunch\n|\nTechmeme\n|\nSlashdot\n|\nWired\n|\nHackers News\n|\nEngadget\n|\nPocket Lint\n|\nThe Verge\nInternational Networks:\n|\nCNN\n|\nBBC\n|\nAl Jazeera\n|\nYahoo\nForum:\n|\nNairaland\n|\nNaij\nOther Links:\nHome\n|\nNigerian Jobs\nHome\n|\nAbout Us\n|\nContact Us\n|\nDisclaimer\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nCopyright\n|\nSubscribe To News Alert\n|\nFacebook\n|\nTwitter\nAll trademarks and copyrights on this page are owned by their respective owners\nCopyright © 2025. latestnigeriannews.com - All rights reserved",
