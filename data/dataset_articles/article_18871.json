  "text": "The Hong Kong Observatory said temperatures over most parts of the territory fell to 12 degrees or below this morning and warned of further drops in the coming days.\nThe weather watchdog said the change in weather came as a northeast monsoon is affecting the coast of southern China, with a broad band of clouds bringing a few rain patches to Guangdong.\nIt said the temperatures are expected to drop further tonight and tomorrow morning.\nMembers of the public should pay attention to the change in weather, keep warm and take care of the elderly and persons with chronic medical conditions, it added.",
