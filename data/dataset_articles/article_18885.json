  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Recent federal layoffs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have raised alarms among local leaders in Central Texas, who fear that critical weather forecasting could be compromised.\nThe layoffs, which affected more than 800 NOAA employees, including some National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologists, were part of a federal budget reduction effort by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), according to the White House.\nU.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Austin expressed his concerns, stating, \"I think these cutbacks eliminating hundreds of positions will expose us to great danger in Central Texas, whether it's from hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, or winds.\" He added, \"I'm deeply concerned about the layoffs.\"\nThe layoffs come at a time when Central Texas is no stranger to extreme weather, such as the severe winds experienced Tuesday. Gusts reached up to 50 mph, and several wildfires broke out in our area, including the Onion Creek Fire in Hays County, which burned over 170 acres of land.\nALSO| Hundreds of NOAA employees fired as part of latest cuts to federal workforce\nLocal leaders worry that life-saving weather alerts, like Tuesday's red flag warning, could be delayed or missed entirely due to the staffing cuts.\nTravis County Judge Andy Brown emphasized the importance of NOAA and the NWS, saying, \"I think this underscores the need that we have for continued funding for things like NOAA and the National Weather Service because you can't always just walk outside and see what the weather is going to bring to you.\"\nEmergency Management Meteorologist and former UT Austin weather professor Troy Kimmel echoed these concerns, stating, \"We cannot do [our] job, TV stations and weather offices cannot do [our] job without the Weather Service, we need them.\" He further warned, \"It's impossible, we cannot do it without them. It will affect how people get watches, warnings, advisories, and general forecasts for the community.\"\nThe White House has defended the layoffs as necessary for budgetary reasons, but the decision has sparked protests at NOAA headquarters, with lawmakers and meteorologists condemning the cuts. U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland criticized the move, saying, \"They are firing people for doing their job. They want to fire the climate scientists for doing their job.\"\nWhile DOGE maintains that the cuts are essential for budget efficiency, local leaders argue that public safety should remain the top priority.",
