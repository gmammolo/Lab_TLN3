  "text": "As the planet continues to overheat and weather patterns suffer whiplash, those working in the agricultural sector face more complex challenges in getting food from farms to your table.\nNow, the United Kingdom is facing enough threats to its food supply chain that a new report has warned that reforms are desperately needed.\nWhat's happening? A report from the UK's National Preparedness Commission has shared a dire warning that the country's food supply chain is unprepared for the number of risks it now faces. From erratic weather and hotter temperatures to trade barriers and economic shocks like COVID-19, a host of challenges render the current system used for food supply unsustainable.\nAlready, food prices in the country have surged to 25% higher than they were a mere few years ago, and due to extreme weather events, the UK experienced one of its worst domestic harvests since 1983 in 2023.\nThe author of the report, Tim Lang, emeritus professor of Food Policy at City University of London, claimed the food resilience framework in the UK is woefully outdated.\nAccording to Sustainability Magazine , Lang explained, \"The UK's post-war food system, while revolutionary in its time, is no longer fit for purpose.\"\nWatch now: Giant snails invading New York City? Why is this concerning? The most worrisome part of all this is the risk of future food insecurity, which could leave millions of people struggling to retain access to food, leading to civil unrest. As global temperatures continue to rise and food becomes more challenging to grow , food prices will continue to soar.\nRetailers and suppliers keep minimal levels of stock on hand because they rely on a fast-moving supply chain to quickly replenish products. When disruptions occur in the supply chain, they limit what can be done to address the depleted stock . Keeping this flawed system in place could result in a future food crisis that causes severe food shortages, public outrage, and severe economic consequences.\nPer the Sustainability report, Lang stressed, \"There is too much complacency about UK food security and civil food resilience barely features at all in forward planning.\"\nWhat is the biggest reason you don't grow food at home?\nNot enough time ⏳\nNot enough space 🤏\nIt seems too hard 😬\nI have a garden already 😎\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\nWhat's being done about these potential risks? Though it remains to be seen what the UK will do to shore up its food supply chain, as far as the challenge of growing food in an ever-warming climate goes, scientists are hard at work on a number of ways to tackle the problem .\nThey are researching the development of plants that can withstand higher temperatures and handle having less access to water, among other things.\nLocal and national governments can also help tackle the issue by enhancing infrastructure and moving toward more sustainable agricultural practices.\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",
