  "text": "Representational Image\nMalappuram, Kerala: Kerala Health Department on Wednesday intensified awareness activities in five districts identified as being at risk of Nipah virus.\nThe Kozhikode-based Kerala One Health Centre for Nipah Research has recently issued fresh warnings, urging heightened vigilance in Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Wayanad and Ernakulam districts. These districts have previously recorded the presence of the Nipah virus in humans or fruit bats.\nThe months from May to September, which coincide with the breeding season of fruit bats, are regarded as the peak period for the virus's spread. However, recent studies suggested that the risk extends into February as well, leading to increased monitoring efforts. A recent study by the National Institute of Virology in Mananthavady, Wayanad, has also confirmed the presence of the virus in fruit bats.\nMalappuram District Medical Officer Dr R Renuka stated that any patient presenting with a viral illness affecting the brain is being tested for Nipah. This protocol applies to patients visiting both government and private hospitals.\nIf there is any suspicion of the disease, samples will be collected and sent to Manjeri Medical College or Kozhikode Medical College for initial testing. If further analysis is required, the samples will be forwarded to National Institute of Virology, Pune, for confirmation. The DMO also emphasised that global health protocols are being strictly followed in this process.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter",
