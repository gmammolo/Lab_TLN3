  "text": "Environmental advocates say plans to log parts of Zoar Valley are still in place as Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nominee for commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation prepares to lead the agency if confirmed.\nThe area is known as one of the most scenic and ecologically diverse environmental areas in Western New York.\nHowever, those hoping to stop the project see this change in leadership as a chance to turn a new leaf in the hopes of stopping the project.\n“It is a clean slate, letting her know about the public’s concerns and that we’re still absolutely focused on requesting that a public hearing be done,” said Lynn Kenney, president of the Zoar Valley Coalition.\nLast fall, members of the Zoar Valley Coalition spoke up against plans by the DEC and New York Connecticut Audubon to log 91 acres of second-growth trees.\nThe DEC and Audubon said at the time that this was an opportunity for environmental education and to improve habitat for certain bird species.\nThe Audubon has now pulled out of the project, but the DEC will continue to move forward with it.\nZoar Valley Coalition leaders said other organizations have joined their cause, including the Buffalo Ornithological Society, WNY Environmental Alliance and the Niagara Frontier Botanical Society.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the DEC said:\n\"DEC is developing options for a revised forest management plan in a select portion of the Zoar Valley Multiple Use Area (MUA), and will work directly with the community as part of our commitment to involving the public in advancing any management plans for this area.\nAs with the earlier proposal, any revised plans for management in the area will continue to protect the adjacent Zoar Unique Area’s old-growth trees and other features while creating habitat to enhance the resilience and adaptability of the Zoar MUA’s ecosystem. Also consistent with the original proposal, any revised project will not include any “clear-cutting” and will be contained wholly within the Zoar Valley MUA and not include any portion of the Zoar Valley Unique Area or the old-growth trees within its boundaries.\nZoar Valley MUA is nearly 3,000 acres, of which only a small portion will include the demonstration area. The MUA will continue to be publicly accessible before, during, and after any project developed, although there may be temporary restrictions in and around a project area during any active management to ensure public safety.\nAs any management plans are developed, DEC will engage directly with the community and our forestry experts to discuss the benefits and importance of habitat management activities, and ensure that any plans developed are reflective of the interests of the community.\nDEC continues to work collaboratively with Audubon New York-Connecticut to educate communities across New York on the environmental and ecological benefits of sustainable forest management.\"\nOther organizations have spoken out against plans to log.\nThe Western New York Environmental Alliance released a statement, saying in part:\n\"Destroying this living healthy habitat for this NYS DEC Audubon logging plan is a dangerous and thoughtless destruction of a long existing, established, and critical natural place. Zoar Valley and this site provides what must be characterized as substantial, if not unique, ecological value and services to the region. It is also a place providing past and future generations access to recreational activities, passive enjoyment, and the many benefits of natural places. Its contribution to human well-being is priceless.\"\nA joint statement released by the Nature Sanctuary Society of WNY and the Niagara Frontier Botanical Society can be found below:",
