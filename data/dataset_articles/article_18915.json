  "text": "Elk reintroduction delayed until at least 2027\nCloquet, Minn. (Northern News Now) - The historic plan to reintroduce elk to Northeast Minnesota has been a controversial topic in recent months and it appears, the plans have hit a snag.\nThe DNR and the Fond du Lac Band were hoping to bring elk back to northeast Minnesota after overhunting forced the animals out of the area.\nHowever, David Trauba from the DNR said the elk population in northwest Minnesota, where they are planning on taking the elk from, was much lower than they had anticipated. The low elk numbers are now prompting the decision to delay the move until 2027 at the earliest.\n“We just don’t have the animals in the northwest yet to be able to really draw from that population,” Trauba said. Trauba speculates that overhunting of bulls could have played a factor.\nIn the meantime, the DNR said they are working to figure out ways to help restore the northwest herds.\nElk biologist with the Fond Du Lac Band, Makenzie Henk, said there is a legally enforced maximum amount of elk for each herd in northwest Minnesota. This is in an effort to limit the damage the elk do to agriculture. The hope was to take some of those extra elk to northeast Minnesota, but the DNR found, during an aerial survey, that the numbers just weren’t there.\n“The surplus is either harvested by state-licensed hunters or we were hoping to bring those to the northeast, unfortunately we just don’t have that surplus,” Henk said.\nHenk is cautiously optimistic for a return of elk to northeast Minnesota in the next few years.\n“I’m going to hope 2027, but I’m not going to begin to speculate, I mean, this is a project with a lot of moving pieces,” Henk said.\nWhile the DNR and Fond du Lac Band are hoping to have elk in northeast Minnesota in the next two years, Henk acknowledged more delays are possible.\n“I think we’ll be able to make something work in the next couple of years, but it could take a little longer,” Henk said\nThe move has sparked some controversy among members of Red Lake Nation in northwest Minnesota, where the DNR and Fond du Lac Band are hoping to take the elk from.\nRELATED: ‘You started a war now’: Elk reintroduction forum gets heated in Cloquet\nRed Lake Nation Tribal Council member, Al Pemberton, doubled down on his stance that he will shoot one Fond du Lac Band moose for every elk taken from the Red Lake Nation treaty area.\n“We finally start hunting them, and then they want to start taking them away, that just don’t sit good with us,” Pemberton said.\nOthers have expressed concerns about damage to agriculture in northeast Minnesota.\nThe DNR will be launching the Northwest Elk Research Project to investigate why the population was lower than anticipated.\nClick here to download the Northern News Now app or our Northern News Now First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 Northern News Now.
