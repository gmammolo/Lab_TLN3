  "text": "CLAREMONT, N.H. — Members of A Better Claremont invite their neighbors to attend a public hearing on Thursday, March 6 at 6 p.m. to express their opposition to a potentially toxic waste transfer station at the Junction.\nFor the past five years, Acuity Management, Inc. has been pushing a proposal to site a construction and demolition debris (C&D) transfer operation near a residential neighborhood and an elementary school on Maple Avenue.\nClaremont leaders have repeatedly shared concerns about the impacts of this project and the company’s disregard for local land-use regulations.\nThe developer’s own estimate says the facility would receive 30 trucks a day, filled with up to 500 tons of mixed C&D materials, a waste stream often containing toxic forever chemicals like lead, mercury and PFAS.\nThis proposal would not only put strain on the region’s roads but could also release harmful particulate matter into the surrounding air and water.\nOn Thursday night, A Better Claremont (ABC) will call on the Department of Environmental Services to reject Acuity’s permit application for a modification to a 1987 recycling permit to build what could be the largest C & D waste transfer operation in the region.\nABC encourages community members to arrive early for support with sign-making, testimony preparation and conversations with your neighbors.\nThe public hearing is hosted by the Department of Environmental Services and will be held Thursday, March 6 at 6 p.m. at the Claremont Opera House.\nABC is a grassroots group working for a safe, vibrant Claremont community that protects our families, our health and the environment.\nSlingshot is an environmental health nonprofit that works alongside most-impacted communities to take aim at polluters and build local power.",
