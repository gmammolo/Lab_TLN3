Shade isn’t a solution People living in low latitudes, including large parts of northern India, will face the most severe repercussions. Some areas are already nearing these dangerous conditions. 06 March, 2025 10:23 am IST Representational image of Delhi heatwave | ANI Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+\nA s global temperatures rise, deadly heatwaves are becoming more common. So is our understanding of how the body responds.\nExtreme heat is a well-known threat to the elderly and people with health conditions. But millions of healthy people may soon face a lethal form of heat stress, no matter how fit or acclimated they are. ‘Uncompensable heat stress’, as this is known, occurs when a healthy, acclimated person taking every precaution—resting, hydrating, and sweating—can no longer keep their core temperature in check.\nPut another way, the body cannot muster sufficient cooling to compensate—leading to overheating and, ultimately, death.\nShow Full Article\nThe body’s limit is determined by a combination of factors including air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind. Early research proposed a threshold for uncompensable heat stress corresponding to a ‘wet-bulb temperature’—a combined measure of heat and humidity—of 35 degrees Celsius. More recent work has added nuance to the wet-bulb temperature threshold, finding that the true limit tends to be lower as most people are not optimally adapted to heat.\nShade is no solution\nPrevious research has also often assumed people will escape indoors to beat the heat, underestimating the threat. But for over a billion people worldwide, moving indoors is not an option. Farmers work long hours under direct sunlight, as do those who must walk long distances to collect drinking water. What about them?\nA paper I recently co-authored addresses this question by combining a detailed scientific model of the human body’s response to heat, with climate model projections of future conditions. We incorporate the effects of sunlight and wind, which play a significant role in outdoor heat exposure but have been oversimplified or ignored in prior work.\nWe show that millions of people engaged in essential outdoor activities will face several days of uncompensable heat stress each year at just 2 ° C of global warming. At 4 ° C of warming, hundreds of millions are impacted and uncompensable heat stress events occur roughly twice as often as at 2 ° C.\nFor context, the world has already warmed about 1.5 ° C since the start of the Industrial Revolution and is headed well past 2 ° C.\nPeople living in low latitudes, including large parts of northern India, will face the most severe repercussions . S ome areas are already nearing these dangerous conditions.\nShade only partially fixes the problem. Standing under a tree or other outdoor shelter reduces solar radiation on the body . However, this does not eliminate radiation because it bounces around anywhere there is daylight. Even assuming abundant shade, the population exposed to uncompensable heat stress is more than six times higher than estimated — if you ignore radiation entirely, we found.\nImpacted communities will need to shift daytime outdoor work to night or face dire health consequences. This is easier said than don. For example, women often bear the brunt of collecting water, but it may not be safe for them to do so at night. Even if direct health shocks can be avoided by major behavioral changes, those changes will incur social, economic, and political consequences.\nI will discuss these and other related topics with international scientists and policymakers at India 2047: Building a Climate-Resilient Future on 19-22 March in New Delhi.",
