What happens to these employees and their vital work to protect the planet?\nThe Trump Administration launched another set of cuts to the federal workforce with hundreds of employees fired at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a move that could lead to the understaffing of agencies that provide vital data and information for first responders, conservation groups, and everyday Americans.\nElon Musk, who now leads the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, is looking to reduce federal spending, and that has come with mass firings across government agencies.\nNOAA is made up of several branches that each handle a different climate control entity, such as environment satellites, fisheries, and the National Weather Service.\nNWS is one of the largest sources of public climate and weather data in the world, and its models are used by meteorologists on a daily basis.\nNOAA hasn't announced exactly how many cuts, if any, were made at NWS, but less staff could have major implications according to a former employee.\n\"The initial impact would be probably the availability of personnel to go and be incident meteorologists at wildfires. It also could impact the timeliness of putting out things like red flag warnings and advisories,\" said Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist and adjunct professor at San Jose State University.\nRead more: California Congresswoman Doris Matsui reacts to federal cuts\nKCRA 3 made numerous attempts to contact the National Weather Service and the national NOAA office to get an idea of how many employees were terminated from this division, but have yet to get a response.\nKCRA 3 has confirmed at least 5 NOAA fisheries employees were fired at the Central Valley office in Sacramento, all probationary employees meaning they had been at the agency for less than a year.\n\"I felt like I was a deer waiting to get shot, and I just didn’t know when,\" said Hannah Mone.\nMone was a natural resources specialist with a focus on endangered species for NOAA Fisheries.\nThe Georgia native came to the Sacramento area to earn her master's degree at the University of California Davis before landing her dream job at the federal agency. It was the perfect role for the nature enthusiast until an email on Feb. 27 told her she was fired, with just an hour to get her belongings and leave.\nSince she was probationary, Mone said she doesn't receive severance pay and her health benefits are gone at the end of the month.\n\"Firing probationary employees across the board has never been done before in my experience...the way that this is being done is extremely chaotic, disrespectful, and demoralizing,\" said Maria Rea, a former Assistant Regional Administrator for NOAA Fisheries Central Valley Office.\nRea retired in 2022 but still maintains her relationships inside the agency. She believes these cuts are unnecessary, telling KCRA 3 that the Central Valley office was already stretched thin.\n\"The people working on the inside know that a lot of these jobs have been cut overtime, the size of government has not grown in decades, and yet the things that Congress have mandated that the agencies do continues to grow,\" said Rea.\nNOAA Fisheries isn't an agency the average American hears about, yet it plays a vital role in protecting native species such as chinook salmon and sturgeon.\nBut it's not just protecting fish. The agency also plays a role in permits for critical infrastructure projects and commercial fishing.\n\"They have to write rules based on science each year, so if there aren’t enough staff to do that, it could easily impact fish that you see at the grocery store both in terms of what’s there and the price of that fish,\" said Rea.\nWith less staff, many employees fear the workload won't decrease, leaving agencies with more work than the workers still there can handle.\n\"We lost four engineers, a couple had about a decade of experience, and one had like 35 years of experience that took the fork in the road deal, so we lost a lot of expertise in our branch in one week,\" said Caleb Wagner.\nWagner was a hydraulic engineer for NOAA Fisheries until he was terminated for being a probationary employee.\nPrior to these latest cuts, employees were offered a \"fork in the road\" option to resign and receive pay until September but waive legal rights to challenge any possible terminations.\n\"I moved here, I’m like, OK, this isn’t the highest paying job in the world, but it’s like stability, and that’s something I haven’t had in a really long time,\" said Wagner.\nThe recent grad left Michigan last summer to come back to California for what he thought would be a lifelong career with the federal government.\nHe said as a California State University Chico student, the Paradise fire of 2018 destroyed the home he was living in, ultimately leading to him dropping out of school.\nWagner finished his degree during the pandemic, even getting his master's degree, but now he's tied to an apartment lease in a city away from family.\n\"It’s going to be like close to $9,000 that I’ll have to pay just to terminate the lease... it’s scary, so I don’t know where the next paycheck's coming from,\" he said.\nIn the termination email sent to employees, it gives guidance on how to appeal their firing, but some would rather move on.\n\"I’m not going to fight for my job back at this point. I don’t have much faith in the federal government to, you know, follow through with their promises... they’ve promised me a lot,\" said Wagner.\nBut for Hannah Mone, she plans to fight what she calls a wrongful termination.\n\"I had good performance, good conduct. My only downfall was that I started back in October of 2024,\" said Mone. \"Federal employees are also human; we just are here to help our communities and be civil servants and, for me, help the environment.\"\nEach employee KCRA spoke with confirmed there are more cuts expected at NOAA, but it's unclear when and how many employees could be next.\n\"For some of these politicians, having that science be explained is inconvenient…inconvenient truth especially on climate science... taking the time to really understand what the consequences would be of making even further reductions is critically important,\" said Maria Rea.\nSee more coverage of top California stories here | Download our app | Subscribe to our morning newsletter | Find us on YouTube here and subscribe to our channel",
