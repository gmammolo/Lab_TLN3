  "text": "Four years later, Mount Jackson resident says runoff from solar farm is still damaging his wife’s property\nMOUNT JACKSON, Va. (WHSV) - A Mount Jackson resident claims water runoff from the town’s solar farm has continued to damage his wife’s property for the past four years.\nDarrin Saylor and his wife live across the street from the sprawling Energix Solar Farm in Mount Jackson, which spans across several acres of land. He said runoff from the farm has damaged their yard, and it’s been an ongoing problem since 2021.\n“This land right here is the future for my wife. She paid it off all through Burger King, from day one,” Saylor said.\nVideo from Saylor’s cell phone captured the couple’s flooded yard. He said the runoff has removed the topsoil from the yard, destroying the grass. According to Saylor, rainy weather only worsens the issue.\n“I have to replace it, year after year, after year. It goes around in circles. Around that tree,” Saylor said, gesturing to a large maple tree in the center of the grass.\nDue to the runoff, Saylor said he’s seeing erosion near the trunks and roots of the several large trees in the yard. If the problem continues, he fears the trees may fall and damage their home.\n“It could tear down the roof,” Saylor said.\nAt the front of the yard, there is a marked spot, where Saylor said lies the source of the runoff. He surrounded the area with rocks, so he knows exactly where it is.\n“I could probably put more dirt around it, but what’s the use now?” Saylor said. “Water’s coming out of there.”\nWHSV reached out to Mount Jackson and Shenandoah County officials for comment. So far, we have not heard back. We will keep you updated both on air and online.\nCopyright 2025 WHSV. All rights reserved.",
