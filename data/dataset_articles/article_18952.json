  "text": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – While deer are often a beautiful sight, for some, they have become a massive problem. Arkansas Game and Fish program coordinator Ralph Meeker said they receive about a dozen complaints yearly, but recently, several have come in. “A lot of the complaints follow flooding or, you know, when the (Arkansas) river comes up or backs up, a lot of deer kind of are pushed toward Little Rock,” Meeker said. Meeker said an overpopulation of deer in urban areas is concerning for the deer’s health and the public. “You will see an increase in deer-vehicle collisions, crop deprivation, landscape deprivation, we have increased incidences of tick-borne diseases in urban areas,” Meeker said. One of the areas being most affected is Randy Machen’s Two Rivers Park neighborhood. He said he knows a thing or two about deer tearing up his yard and cars. “My stepdaughter got a deer the other day that jumped over the car, on top of the car, then I’ve got another daughter that got hit in her car,” Machen said. “It’s really dangerous; two bikers have gotten hit before.” Meeker said he has also seen a few reports of deer attacks, typically its momma deer defending their fawns. Those living in the area are asking the city to do more; one suggestion has been urban deer hunts. Machen says he supports the hunts, suggesting a 30% reduction. However, he also shares he would support deer being darted and relocated. According to Meeker, the AGFC can only conduct an urban deer hunt when contacted by the city, and if the city of Little Rock contacted them, they would be more than happy to implement it. The city of Little Rock shared Wednesday that they are aware of the issue but do not plan on a hunt as of this time. Meeker says to make a report on the overpopulation of deer, you can contact your local city council member and make a report. They will then send it to the Arkansas Game and Fish.
