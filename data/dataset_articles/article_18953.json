  "text": "DECATUR, Ind. (WISH) — A commercial duck breeder in Adams County is the latest Indiana farm to be hit with avian influenza, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health reported Wednesday night. The affected flock, consisting of 3,215 ducks, has been quarantined, and control areas have been activated at farms in portions of Adams County and adjacent Jay County. Indiana, California and Pennsylvania are the top duck producing states in the United States. The commercial duck breeder site is the second farm in Adams County this year to have birds contract the virus. The first was a commercial turkey operation in January. It’s at least the 22nd farm in Indiana to be hit this year. So far, a state dashboard reports , 6,957,523 birds at Indiana farms have died of bird flu or been killed to stop its spread. Birds on Indiana farms are not the only ones affected. A bald eagle was found Monday seizing in a field, later dying what was suspected to be bird flu, News 8 reported . The Indiana Department of Natural Resources reported earlier this month that wild birds with avian influenza have been detected in 30 of the state’s 92 counties: Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Benton, Boone, Clinton, Decatur, Gibson, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Henry, Huntington, Jackson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Marion, Newton, Pike, Porter, Randolph, Ripley, Shelby, Starke, Tippecanoe, Union, Vanderburgh and Vermillion. The wild bird outbreak in Indiana includes more than 1,500 sandhill crane deaths in Greene, Jackson, Jasper, LaPorte, Newton, Starke and Union counties. Humans can get bird flu, and there’s been a recorded death in the U.S., but federal health officials say the risk to people’s health is low.",
