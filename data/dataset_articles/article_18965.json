  "text": "Concern about the avian flu is spreading among wildlife agencies and wildlife rehabilitation experts, much like the virus itself.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the virus has been detected in over12,000 wild birds since the outbreak began in January 2022. Florida is the state with the highest number of detections at 735, followed by California, with 726.\nLauren Barkley, manager of the von Arx Wildlife Hospital at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, said that in 2022, all the wildlife rehab centers started discussing the onset of bird flu cases.\n“It was almost like a panic moment,” she said. “You’ve heard about it. But what do we do? How do we protect the animals that we have in our care? How do we protect the animals that are our permanent residents? Because it does almost spread like wildfire. And everyone’s still trying to understand the virus.”\nIn Florida, the avian, or bird flu, has appeared in 35 Florida counties, including Charlotte, Collier and Palm Beach, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Lee County was not listed in FWC’s latest update in November. However, since then, Lee County has joined the list, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe numbers are small, except for Palm Beach County, which has seen 40 cases, according to the CDC. There were four cases in Charlotte, Collier had five cases and Lee had two.\nThe USDA reports that 28 wild birds nationwide have been detected with avian flu over the last 30 days (Jan. 19 to Feb. 18) but none have been in Florida.\nThe way the virus spreads can create a continuous cycle, Barkley said. For example, say a duck dies of the virus and the body is on the shore.\n“Then an eagle comes to eat the dead bird, they ingest the bird and let’s say the eagle has chicks and takes it up to its chicks,” she said.\nThe virus can affect them pretty quickly with devastating results, she said.\nThat’s what happened in what might be the most famous avian flu fatality so far in Southwest Florida: the recent death of two baby eaglets that were the darlings of a popular online webcam that has been broadcasting live video of a nest in North Fort Myers for many years, allowing many to watch the life cycle of bald eagle parents and their offspring.\nThe death of the eaglets may have brought the story of bird flu to life in the public eye in the region, Barkley said.\nIf another bird eats from the same duck carcass, becomes infected and dies and another animal eats from the new dead carcass, “it’s a cycle that never ends,” Barkley said.\nShe said there have been no confirmed cases at the von Arx Wildlife Hospital, but several bird samples have been sent for testing, and they’re waiting for the results.\nThe majority of the testing is on waterfowl, including Muscovy ducks, the blue-winged teal, raptors like great horned owls, eagles and black vultures, she said.\nAt the hospital, staff take special precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, called Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), she said.\n“Our staff wears personal protective equipment, including gloves, masks and gowns. We quarantine potential HPAI suspects and patients,” Barkley said.\nThe outbreak in Florida is believed to have followed the introduction of the virus last year from Europe to Canada, the FWC says. The virus then traveled with migratory waterfowl down the Atlantic Flyway to Florida and other states.\nAccording to the FWC, in Florida, the species that have had presumptive or confirmed bird flu cases since 2022 include waterfowl like mallard ducks, Canada geese, green-winged teal and others. Waterbirds include the brown pelican, great blue heron, wood stork, great egret and more. Raptors include the bald eagle, great horned owl, turkey vulture and others.\nBarkley said it’s important for people to know about bird flu because they need to be aware of what’s happening in the environment. It’s important from a human health standpoint, and the virus is still mutating, she added.\nA dolphin in the state’s Big Bend area has tested positive for the virus. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other reports include hundreds of Maine harbor and gray seals dying in 2022 after being infected with bird flu.\nDomestic cats that roam outdoors have contracted it when eating dead prey contaminated with the virus.\nThe CDC reports that there have been 68 human cases of bird flu nationally with one death in Louisiana. Of the total cases, the bulk of exposure to the virus came from dairy herds, poultry farms and culling operations. The CDC says that public health risks are low. There has been no person-to-person transmission at this time.\nAccording to the CDC, dairy cows in 16 states and a total of 968 dairy herds have been affected. The data shows none in Florida and none in the Southeast United States and the Midwest. Most cases are in California, Nevada and Arizona.\nAcross the country, many millions of chickens have been euthanized due to bird flu, but the actual numbers vary depending on the source. However, if it’s found in one flock, the entire flock must be killed.\nDr. Gary Butcher wants to put bird flu and its risks into a historical perspective. For the last 30 years, Butcher has worked as a poultry veterinarian for the state of Florida. He is a professor and researcher in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida. Over the years, he’s traveled to 65 countries, assisting them with poultry operations, working with bird flu disease and helping address problems. He was headed to Trinidad and Tobago when Florida Weekly spoke to him.\n“We always have avian influenza in the United States,” Butcher said. “Why do we always have it in the United States? Because it’s always going to be present in the migratory birds and the shorebirds. All the data we have right now shows that every year when the migratory birds cross from Canada into the U.S., over one-third of them are infected with and shedding avian influenza. We can say for hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years, influenza virus and migratory birds have developed this relationship.”\nButcher has seen several cycles of avian flu come and go throughout his career.\n“I think probably the biggest time it came to the forefront was back in 1997 to the year 2000,” he said. “That’s when it became an international crisis.”\nThat’s when the bird flu was first recognized as being able to infect humans, Butcher said.\nIt surfaced in Hong Kong, associated with the “wet markets” where live chickens were sold, he said, causing a great panic at the time.\n“So now, all of a sudden, avian influenza can affect people. And my gosh, it’s even killing people in some cases. And there’s just incredible fear throughout the world worldwide,” Butcher said.\nThat particular virus never made it to this hemisphere, Butcher said. But the media predictions were that this was going to be the new 1918 Spanish flu, when millions died.\n“Well, of course, since 1997, worldwide, we’ve had less than 900 human cases,” Butcher said. “We’ve had less than 500 deaths.” If you look at other statistics, “three to five million people die a year from cigarette smoking worldwide. And we live along with that. No problem.”\n“So, this one will come and go, and then whether three years or five years, seven years later, we’ll have another strain come up that causes some problems too,” Butcher said.\nAs far as impacts on poultry, from USDA statistics, “We have about 325 million egg layers in the U.S.,” Butcher said. “And in 2024, we lost about 6 to 8% of our layers total.”\nSome of those farms were back into production in six months, he said. Florida has about 13 million egg layers and has not seen any avian influenza.\n“We’ve not had a single flock infected commercially with this virus.” He’s proud of that fact.\n“But I can say a lot has to do with how we raise our chickens in Florida,” he said. “We have very tight biosecurity.”\nYou can’t just drive up to a poultry farm and walk in, he said. You have to go through preventive procedures, wear coveralls and boots, be questioned on where you’ve been to see if there’s any potential exposure in the past. If you have had contact with pet birds or backyard chickens, you won’t be allowed access.\n“We have to keep cool heads,” Butcher said. “You know, you’re seeing panic right now. I guess you can call it a panic. It’s just a lot of people are wondering really what’s going on. But this is a cycle. It’s going to come and go.” ¦\nIn the KNOW\nWhat is bird flu?\nAvian influenza (bird flu) refers to a disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. Bird flu viruses can infect birds’ respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and have been identified in more than 100 species of wild birds worldwide. Wild aquatic birds, including gulls, terns and shorebirds, and wild waterfowl, such as ducks, geese and swans, are considered reservoirs (natural hosts) for bird flu viruses. Most wild birds infected with bird flu viruses are asymptomatic (i.e., do not exhibit signs or symptoms of illness). Some bird flu viruses can infect domestic poultry and other domestic and backyard birds, and outbreaks of bird flu in domestic poultry occur worldwide.”\nSource: CDC\nHow does it spread?\nInfected birds can shed bird flu through saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Feces are an especially important mode of transmission in wild birds. Animals can become infected when they are around other infected animals or through contaminated surfaces.\nSource: FWC\nHow can you help?\nIf you find a deceased bird or bird displaying any neurological or respiratory signs, report it to FWC at (888) 404-3922 or myfwc.com/bird. They advise that people should not come in direct contact with a bird displaying symptoms.",
