You can see where there's dirt. You can see... There's a section of dirt above the bushes.\"\nAndy Else\n\"We won’t know if it’s going to come back, or [if] the silt is too heavy on some of it, or I might have to replant some of it. And there's no way to know. I mean, you can't. Not right now, no.\"\nKeith Burrell\n\"Now, Rachel and Annie have been rebuilding their house on the banks of the Malheur River for about 4 years, but they tell me that their neighbors that have lived here for decades told them that this is the worst flooding they have seen in 73 years.\"",
