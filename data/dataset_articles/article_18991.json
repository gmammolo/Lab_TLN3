  "text": "Executive Summary\nThe Monsoon 2024 disaster, as reported by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and supported by data from the PDMA daily situation reports and the UN damages dashboard (updated on 9th October 2024), caused 368 fatalities, including 186 children and 55 women, and 668 injuries. It led to the complete destruction of 15,000 households, partial damage to 43,000 households, and the loss of 2,283 livestock, severely affecting communities reliant on agriculture and livestock. The estimated affected population includes 243,482 individuals in Sindh, 136,322 in Baluchistan, 7,186 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), 1,764 in Punjab, 1,677 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and 1,664 in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). Climate change-triggered monsoon rains compounded the destruction, significantly damaging critical infrastructure such as roads and bridges, disrupting mobility and livelihoods. In response to the escalating humanitarian crisis, Welthungerhilfe (WHH), in collaboration with six local humanitarian partners—Community Development Foundation (CDF), Fast Rural Development Program (FRDP), Doaba Foundation, Human Organization for Peaceful Environment (HOPE), Tardeep Rural Development Program (TRDP), and Research and Development Foundation (RDF)—and one consortium partner, CESVI, rapidly conducted a Multi-Sector Rapid Needs Assessment (MSRNA), piloting the MSRNA tool developed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG). This assessment covered 420 villages in 210 Union Councils across Sindh (Badin, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Umerkot, Jacobabad, and Dadu), Baluchistan (Jhal Magsi), and Punjab (Rajanpur). The study identified immediate humanitarian needs, including urgent food assistance and cash transfers for the most vulnerable populations, such as female-headed households, children, and individuals with disabilities. It also highlighted the pressing need for the restoration of food supply chains, access to shelter materials, and hygiene supplies, particularly for women and the elderly. Additionally, the study emphasized the urgent requirement for livelihood recovery initiatives, including agricultural support, skilled labor training, and cash-for-work programs. To address gaps in healthcare, it stressed the importance of mobile clinics and expanded access to maternal and reproductive health services. Furthermore, it highlighted that the rehabilitation of infrastructure, particularly roads, and the development of a multi-sectoral recovery plan focused on long-term resilience and community involvement are essential to ensuring a sustainable and equitable recovery in the affected regions",
