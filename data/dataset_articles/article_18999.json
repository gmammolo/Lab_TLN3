Further testing is underway this week to confirm that treated water does not exceed licensed limits prior to direct discharge to Haggart Creek,” the statement says.\nNews of the latest leak comes after government officials said last month that they believe about 19 million litres of cyanide-contaminated water leaked from a containment pond at the site last year before the problem was spotted and the water diluted in early January.\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 5, 2025.",
