  "text": "A community board’s decision to close a heavily used recycling facility in Raetihi is back on the table after a public outcry.\nThe decision could be quashed this week following a recommendation for the Waimarino-Waiouru Community Board to revoke a resolution to disestablish the Raetihi Recycling Station.\nAt a meeting in October last year, the community board also approved replacing the station with a trailer collecting recycling for an hour once a week for two months and then, for the following four months, once a fortnight.\nThe new recommendation comes in a report from Ruapehu District Council managers to be considered by the community board at its meeting in Raetihi on Thursday night.",
