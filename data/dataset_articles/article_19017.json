  "text": "News Fire Danger map shows most of San Benito County is at high risk, updates on county fire department By Dania Romero May 7, 2025 7:00 PM Published May 7, 2025 2:55 PM SAN BENITO, Calif. (KION) - Dry grass stretches across open fields near Nash Road, a reminder of the increasing fire danger across San Benito County. With fire protection contracts set to expire at the end of this year, the county is now accelerating efforts to form its own fire department.\nCounty supervisors have launched the search for a fire chief to lead the creation of the new department, which will replace services currently provided under contract with Hollister Fire. That contract ends in December.\n“We want somebody that's looking towards the future, not just stuck in the past,” said San Benito County Supervisor Ignacio Velazquez.\nThe county’s plan includes building multiple fire stations to provide broader coverage. Velazquez said the goal is to place stations on the west side, in central areas, and the eastern part of the community, while also figuring out how to serve South County.\nThe urgency is underscored by new hazard severity maps released by CAL FIRE, which show that most of San Benito County is now considered a high-risk area for wildfires.\nResidents living in these danger zones are taking the threat seriously.\n“It’s very important that we have enough coverage for our community and enough firefighters so they’re not in danger,” said one woman who lives in a high-risk area. “Everyone — homeowners, families — we all need protection.”\nAnother homeowner added, “It’s very dangerous, but we do our part to keep our property safe. And we hope everyone else does too.”\nThough some, including Hollister Fire Chief David Goulding, believe city and county collaboration works best, he said he supports the county’s decision to establish its own department.\nLaunching the department will cost an estimated $3 million, according to Velazquez, but it will also create new jobs and opportunities for local residents.\n“Our goal is to look here locally for young people who want an opportunity to work in fire services,” Velazquez said.\nStill, the clock is ticking.\nWith only months to go before the existing fire contract expires, county officials are working quickly to get systems in place.\nWhen asked if the department would be ready in time, Velazquez responded, “What we're gonna make happen, we need to make happen. We need to make sure the public understands they’re going to be protected — they’re going to be safe.”\nThe county hopes to hire an interim fire chief by the end of the month and plans to announce soon when the public can begin applying for fire service positions.\nArticle Topic Follows: News Jump to comments ↓",
