  "text": "GILLIES TOWNSHIP — Firefighters from three rural fire services responded early Wednesday afternoon to a fire in Gillies Township that forced the closure of Highway 595.\nThe fire broke out on a property near Neva Road and created a large amount of smoke.\nSarah Shoemaker, chief of Nolalu Emergency Services, told Dougall Media \"it appears there are hay bales in the field, and that's where it seems to be concentrated, but we don't know exactly what the cause of the fire is.\"\nShoemaker said no one was injured but a homeowner was assessed on the scene as a precaution.\nThe fire resulted in what she described as minor damage to outbuildings, a shed and some vehicles.\nMultiple resources were deployed to the incident including 20 volunteer firefighters, two tankers, three rescue vehicles and two command trucks.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\nWith files from Emma Chilton/TBT News",
