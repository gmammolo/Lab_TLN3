  "text": "The risk of wildfire for Red Deer has climbed from low in 2024 to medium risk this season, according to a recent insurance study.\nUsing weather forecasts from the Canadian Wildland Fire Information System, the study by Insurtech company MyChoice showed Red Deer, Edmonton, Calgary, Grande Prairie and Fort McMurray all faced medium risk, while Banff, Lethbridge, and Medicine Hat were at high risk of wildfire.\nBut Evan Stewart, assistant deputy chief with Red Deer Emergency Services, said he would recommend the public instead rely on the Alberta Government's fire danger map for their information, which is updated daily and based on a variety of data.\nOn Tuesday, the city's fire danger rating was raised to 'very high,' and Red Deer Emergency Services urged residents to use extra caution.\nStewart said until there is enough moisture, weather conditions are right for fire to spread quickly with the dry fuel in the city's natural areas.\n\"We are a city within a park, and we do have wildfire risk in the City of Red Deer. Those beautiful natural areas create wildfire risk in the times of the year where those fuels can be dry and weather can be conducive to wildfire,\" Stewart said.\n\"There is an undeniable trend of warming happening in our region and it is leading to earlier wildfire seasons, longer wildfire seasons, and more severe wildfires when they do happen. Red Deer is not immune to those risks. But what I can say is Red Deer has taken very proactive steps in being prepared for wildfires,\" said Stewart, who is a wildland urban interface specialist.\nHe said central, southeastern and parts of northwestern Alberta have been in a multi-year drought cycle, and Red Deer started the wildfire season with extremely dry conditions. Crews have responded to small incidents in the natural areas within the city since the snow has been gone.\n\"Every year in late April and early May, Alberta is in a very difficult situation for wildfires and that's been consistent for quite some time.\"\nStewart said Red Deer is very well-positioned to withstand increased wildfire risk, but the public needs to be cautious with any ignition source and make sure to call 911 about any suspicious activity or smoke in wildland areas. Citizens should also be mindful of managing wildland fuels on their property and following Firesmart principles.\nEnvironment Canada has forecast a 30 per cent chance of showers on Thursday, followed by a mix of sun and clouds on Friday and Saturday with a high of 21 C. Periods of rain were expected starting Sunday.\nThis week is Emergency Preparedness Week and Red Deerians are encouraged to learn how they can get ready. Information is available online, including how to prepare a 72-hour emergency kit, at www.reddeer.ca/GetPrepared. An Emergency Preparedness Guide can also be downloaded.\n“Building an emergency kit doesn’t have to happen all at once. Build your kit over time by taking advantage of sales at the grocery store, updating prescriptions, and purchasing extra batteries for flashlights,\" said Carol Lind, the city's emergency management co-ordinator.\nRed Deer Emergency Services will be at Touch-A-Truck on May 10 at Westerner Park, providing demonstrations on how citizens can build their own emergency kit, and other emergency preparedness information. A draw for a vehicle emergency kit will be held, and kids can tour the Mobile Command Unit.\n“After a year like 2024, where wildfire losses in Canada reached unprecedented levels, preparation is more important than ever,” said MyChoice CEO Aren Mirzaian.\n“While insurers and reinsurers are adjusting to rising climate risks, homeowners can take practical steps to reduce their exposure. Clearing dry brush, trimming trees to maintain distance from the home, installing fire-resistant roofing and siding, and storing flammable materials away from structures can go a long way. Not only do these measures help protect your property, but they also strengthen your position when it comes to securing affordable insurance in high-risk areas.”\nInsured losses from weather-related disasters soared to $8.4 billion in 2024, the highest in Canadian history. The Jasper wildfire alone caused $1.1 billion in damages.",
