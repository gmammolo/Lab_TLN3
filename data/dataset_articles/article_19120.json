  "text": "FOLSOM – After implementing an inspection and quarantine program at Folsom Lake to try to stop the spread of golden mussels, state park officials said the highly invasive aquatic species was found attached to a boat.\nSo far, nearly 5,000 vessels have been inspected. Now, state parks officials said golden mussels were found attached to a boat during an inspection on Tuesday at Beals Point.\nCalifornia State Parks said the live golden mussels were on a boat that was pulled from the water of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and brought to Folsom for an inspection.\n\"The inspection and quarantine program we have implemented is in place to protect billions of dollars of water and hydroelectric infrastructure in addition to recreation and the fishery,\" Folsom Lake State Recreation Area Superintendent Mike Howard said. \"The discovery of live golden mussels [on Tuesday] validates the importance of this effort.\"\nPark officials are working with the owner and other agencies to safely decontaminate and quarantine the boat.\nThis comes about four weeks after the inspection and quarantine program was implemented at Folsom Lake. Ahead of the summer season, boats must be inspected and receive a quarantine seal and cannot enter the water for 30 days.\nAfter that, the boats can return to the lake.\nGolden mussels were found in the delta last year , becoming the first known time the highly invasive golden mussels were found in North America, officials said.\nThey pose a threat to water quality and infrastructure. They can also damage boats by attaching to hulls and clogging engines.\nAll trailered or motorized vessels must go through the inspection and quarantine. It does not apply to canoes, kayaks and other non-motorized boats.\nMore from CBS News Northern California to see warm finish to week before cooler Mother's Day Auburn home going for under $200,000 in regional real-estate rarity California Highway Patrol officers, firefighters help free great blue heron caught in fishing line New bridge over Highway 50 in West Sacramento nearly complete In: Folsom Lake Brandon Downs Brandon Downs is a digital content producer at CBS Sacramento.\nTwitter",
