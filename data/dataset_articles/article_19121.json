  "text": "Black bear hunt sparks debate after deadly attack in Florida\nA deadly black bear attack in Collier County — the first ever recorded in Florida — has sparked an urgent debate over how the state should manage its growing bear population.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) confirmed that DNA test results are pending after three black bears were killed in the Everglades, suspected of being involved in the fatal incident that occurred Monday morning in the small town of Jerome, just north of U.S. 41 and south of Interstate 75.\nNow, state officials are weighing a controversial solution: reintroducing a public bear hunt, the first in nearly a decade. Under the proposed plan, up to 187 black bears could be targeted in a three-week hunting season across 31 counties, including Lee, Collier, and Hendry.\nFor some, like avid hunter Terry Miller, the idea is both exciting and practical.\n\"Absolutely! I'd be excited about it,\" Miller said. \"The thought of doing a bear hunt would be thrilling, but at the same time, the biological and ecological value is important.\"\nMiller, who also hunts deer, hogs, ducks and birds, believes the hunt could be managed responsibly. He points to the proposed limit of 55 bear kills in Southwest Florida as a reasonable number.\n\"It's not very many,\" he said. \"You just have to make sure people don't go over the quota.\"\nThe last time Florida held a public bear hunt, in 2015, it was met with intense backlash after hunters exceeded the state's intended harvest limit. Critics argue that another hunt could lead to similar outcomes, if not worse.\nCharity King, a wildlife advocate, strongly opposes the plan.\n\"It's their home too. There are professionals trained to handle these situations,\" King said.\nKing sees the proposed hunt as an open invitation for unqualified individuals to target a species she considers iconic to Florida’s wilderness.\n\"That would be like a poaching fest,\" she said. \"It seems a little heinous, doesn't it?\"\nThe state is considering issuing hunting permits through a $5 lottery system. With an estimated 4,000 black bears across Florida, FWC officials argue that population control may be necessary to prevent further conflicts.\nStill, emotions are running high.\n\"People associated bears with teddy bears- something soft and cuddly,\" Miller noted. \"But we have to face the fact that we may be dealing with overpopulation.\"\nFWC will host a public meeting on the issue on May 21–22 in Ocala. Residents can also submit comments online to share their thoughts.\nAs Florida’s black bears remain under scrutiny, the coming weeks could determine whether the state’s forests remain a sanctuary or become the setting for a highly contested hunt.\nDOWNLOAD the free Gulf Coast News app for your latest news and alerts on breaking news, weather, sports, entertainment, and more.",
