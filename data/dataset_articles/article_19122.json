People Editorial Guidelines Published on May 7, 2025 06:36PM EDT Comments Bear 399 with her four cubs in Teton National Park on June 15, 2020. Credit : George Frey/Getty\nNEED TO KNOW Grizzly No. 1058, a 5-year-old bear, was killed in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park He was one of Grizzly No. 399's four cubs, and suffered the same fate as his mother, after he was fatally struck by a vehicle Park officials discovered his body on Tuesday, May 6\nOne of the grizzly bears who belonged to a beloved grizzly family in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park was fatally struck by a vehicle, the park said on Tuesday, May 6.\nThe 5-year-old bear, known as Grizzly No. 1058, died the same way his mother, Grizzly No. 399, who was also fatally struck in October 2024, did, the park said in a statement . From 2009 to 2024, fatal vehicle collisions killed 51 grizzly bears in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).\nIt is unclear when No. 1058 was killed, but park rangers discovered his body about 125 yards from Highway 26 near the Buffalo Fork River on Tuesday. Officials said that he had probably died several days before his body was found.\nGrizzly No. 1058 was identified through ear tags and a passive integrated transponder (PIT) microchip. His remains were put back onto the landscape in Grand Teton National Park.\nGrizzly bear 399 with four cubs on August 25, 2021.

The four cubs were first spotted with their mother in May 2020. Since then, he had been seen occasionally in the park since he was weaned in 2022. He was not spotted this spring.\nThe bear’s mother was approximately 28 years old when she was killed and was the oldest known reproducing female grizzly in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, Hilary Cooley, Grizzly Bear Recovery Coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, previously said.\nBear 399 with her four cubs in Teton National Park. Alamy\nShe was beloved by tourists, biologists and wildlife photographers, with a book, Grizzly 399: The World's Most Famous Mother Bear , a PBS nature episode and several social media pages dedicated to her.\n“Grizzly bear 399 has been perhaps the most prominent ambassador for the species,” said Grand Teton National Park Superintendent Chip Jenkins. “She has inspired countless visitors into conservation stewardship around the world and will be missed.”\nClose Leave a Comment Read more:",
