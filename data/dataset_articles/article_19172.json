  "text": "Sirsa villagers raise a stink over dirty pond\nIn Sirsa’s Nanuana village, a pond (johad) that hasn’t been cleaned for nearly three years has become a source of trouble for local residents and passers-by. Foul smell emanating from the pond makes it difficult for people to stand near it, leave alone animals drinking from it.\nVillagers said layers of algae and trash have covered the pond. As the pond has not been cleaned nor fresh water refilling has been added to it for years, the stagnant water has started rotting and emits a strong smell.\nThe villagers said they had raised the issue with the sarpanch many times, but to no avail. The unbearable stench forces people to cover their faces when they walk past the pond. Those living in its vicinity are finding it difficult to live peacefully. The people fear that the dirty water may cause a disease outbreak.\nThe pond is located near important places like a government school, village office, bus stand and an Anganwari centre, which are frequented by many people, daily. Village sarpanch Heera Lal stated that the main issue was the lack of vacant space nearby for draining out the dirty water. The nearest panchayat land is 3 km away. He said a proposal was submitted to lay a pipeline from the pond to the flood canal. Officials from the Panchayati Raj Department are expected to visit the site soon, after which a plan will be made for draining out the dirty water and cleaning the pond, he added.",
