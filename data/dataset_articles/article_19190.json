  "text": "Recent reports from the Seoul Metropolitan Government reveal that nearly half of Seoul’s sewer pipelines are over 30 years old, with more than 30 percent of them exceeding 50 years, raising significant safety concerns.\nAging sewer pipes are considered one of the main contributors to ground subsidence, commonly known as sinkholes. As water leaks through cracks in these pipes, it washes away surrounding soil, creating underground voids that can cause roads to collapse.\nIn districts such as Jongno, Yongsan, Seongbuk and Yeongdeungpo, more than 40 percent of the sewer system is over 50 years old. From 2020 to 2024, nearly half of all ground subsidence cases nationwide were linked to damaged sewer lines.\nDespite Seoul investing approximately 200 billion won annually in recent years to replace around 100 kilometers of pipe, this effort may not be enough to keep up with the rapidly aging infrastructure.\ndon@heraldcorp.com\ngood 0\nsad 0\nangry 0\nrecommended 0 [{\"ART_ID\":10487496,\"MAIN_THUMB\":\"\\/news\\/cms\\/2025\\/05\\/14\\/news-p.v1.20250514.6a5e939e42a2441f89b915573a90fbd5_T1.gif\",\"CODE_TYPE\":\"S\",\"CODE_ID\":\"S410405\",\"SERVICE_FLAG\":\"Y\",\"CODE_NM_CATE\":\"More sports\",\"CODE_ENG_NM\":\"\",\"LINK_URL\":\"\",\"SERVICE_YMD\":\"2025-05-15\",\"VIEW_YN\":\"N\",\"SUB_TITLE\":\"\",\"SUMMARY\":\"According to Sportico\\u2019s list of the 50 highest-paid athletes of all time, Michael Jordan leads with $4.15 billion in career earnings, fueled largely by his long-standing partnership with Nike and the sale of his stake in the Charlotte Hornets.
