  "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Law Enforcement is trying to track down somebody who stabbed an elephant seal pup multiple times. NOAA says the 300-pound seal pup survived the attack in a cove in Neskowin, Oregon, on March 16. It was attacked some time between 8:30pm and 11pm. \"The Marine Stranding Team monitored and evaluated the animal before relocating it,\" NOAA Fisheries said in a news release . They described the suspect as \"approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a standard build, black and white hair, a groomed beard, and a large gap between his front teeth.\"",
