  "text": "Helium has quietly become one of the most indispensable resources of modern life. It’s used in hospital equipment, spacecraft, deep-sea breathing mixtures, electronics manufacturing, and scientific instruments – yet its supplies are notoriously precarious.\nThose precarious supplies nearly derailed the work of Nancy Washton, a chemist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), who oversees instruments that rely on helium to stay cool.\nShe was forced to shut down a crucial nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer in 2022, when her supplier started cutting deliveries.\nHelium’s unique low boiling point, around -452 °F, makes it vital for cooling superconducting magnets found in MRI scanners, nuclear magnetic resonance devices, and other sensitive equipment.\nIts inert nature ensures it doesn’t react with other chemicals. Since it’s also very light, it’s used to fill balloons for meteorological measurements and essential airbags in cars.\nThis gas is so lightweight that it can leak into space over time, making it impossible to recapture once it’s gone. Existing supply lines rely on drilling deep into Earth’s crust, where radioactive decay gradually produces helium.\nProducers separate helium from natural gas streams before shipping it off to meet scientific, medical, and industrial demand.\n“We are now living on the banked liquid helium that the vendors had,” said Washton, who also noted the price at one point reached $55 per liter to cool a magnet. Researchers around the world, including teams using NMR spectrometers, have felt the pinch.\nThis forced her to mothball some of PNNL’s superconducting instruments, disrupting important energy research.\nOthers have installed expensive recovery systems that can recollect much of the boiled-off gas, re-liquefy it, and reuse it. But recovery setups are costly, need careful maintenance, and can require new pipework throughout a lab.\nSmaller institutions often struggle with these expenses, raising concerns that cutting-edge research could suffer while budgets get stretched.\nHospitals use more helium than any other sector, about one-third of the global market. The gas cools powerful magnets in MRI scanners. If supply lines falter, scans may be delayed or canceled.\nSome new MRI models require as little as a single liter of helium, using sealed units that recirculate the gas.\nThese machines often cost more and produce slightly lower magnetic field strengths, yet they offer hope for reducing helium demand.\nAnalysts expect global helium demand to double by 2035 because of its role in semiconductor and electric vehicle battery manufacturing.\nDespite this, no large-scale artificial method exists to produce helium. It is created naturally in our planet’s crust at a slow rate, and it continually drifts out of the atmosphere.\nSupply disruptions are common, fueled by events like maintenance shutdowns at processing plants and geopolitical conflicts.\nQatar, Algeria, and the United States remain key suppliers, but mishaps and trade sanctions can put deliveries in jeopardy.\nMajor natural gas exporters hope to tap additional helium reserves. Tanzania’s recent discovery of a large helium field is slated to begin production in 2025, marking the first time helium will be extracted at scale without relying on fossil fuels.\nQatar also plans to bring a new helium plant online by 2027. These projects could help ease market jitters.\nYet some experts, including Oxford’s Christopher Ballentine, warn that the logistics and financing for these fields may take years to materialize.\nOver the years, governments have tried to manage helium by maintaining strategic stockpiles. The U.S. Federal Helium Reserve, once the planet’s largest source, was sold in 2024 to a private firm.\nConcerned groups such as The Compressed Gas Association cautioned that this sale might bring added uncertainty to an already volatile market. Predicting stable output has grown difficult, and prices have soared accordingly.\n“This is serious and we need to deal with it,” said Washton. She suggests that ordinary people could be caught off guard if helium shortages intensify.\nIf future shortages worsen, everything from routine hospital scans to advanced semiconductor production might be impacted.\nStakeholders are cautiously optimistic that new helium fields, smaller MRI machines, and better recycling measures will prevent a dire shortfall.\nBut the gas’s rare qualities mean replacements are tough to find. Efforts are underway to reuse every drop possible, even if that requires pricey equipment and careful planning.\nThe study is published in Physics Today.\n—–\nLike what you read?
