  "text": "(PINPOINT WEATHER) — Good afternoon and happy Wednesday! We have been dealing with some scattered wet weather across the Carolinas this afternoon that should start to fade later this evening and overnight. Thursday we are watching for potential strong storms in the afternoon as an area of low pressure starts to develop. Mother’s Day Weekend is looking generally dry though some showers are possible on Sunday. Early next week looks wet as a slow-moving upper-level low swings through the region keeping our temperatures cool. As for tonight and your Thursday, scattered showers this evening will start to fade as we head into the overnight hours with lows in the low to mid-60s. Thursday should be a little warmer across the region with highs in the 80s, but thunderstorms will start to flare up in the afternoon with some severe storms possible. The primary concern will be for damaging winds and hail though an isolated tornado can’t be ruled out. Highs should be in the low 80s. More hit-and-miss showers and storms are possible on Friday before we get some drier weather over the weekend. Highs on Friday should be in the low 80s along with those hit-and-miss afternoon storms. Saturday should bring some drier and cooler weather with highs in the mid-70s with a mix of sun and clouds. For Mother’s Day, we should see generally dry weather, but a shower is possible in the afternoon, especially from Charlotte and points south. Heading into next week, more wet weather is on the way for the region thanks to a slow-moving upper-level low. Ran is expected for both Monday and Tuesday along with seasonably cool temperatures with highs in the low to mid-70s. In the meantime, make sure you have an umbrella if you’re heading out the door tonight! For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to Queen City News.",
