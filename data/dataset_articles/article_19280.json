  "text": "HOLLAND, Mich. — After 32 years of carrying the sandy feet of beachgoers to and from the waterfront in Holland, the stairs at Laketown Beach Park are gone.\nThe stairs were initially closed on March 26 due to safety concerns. Deconstruction of the stairs began on April 17 and the remaining debris is expected to be cleaned up by May 9.\nThe Laketown Parks Commission is now in the process of considering new stair designs to help beachgoers access Lake Michigan.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, the commission held a special meeting where they reviewed two options for possible stairways.\nThe commission did not reach a decision at that meeting and asked Matt Levandoski, senior landscape architect for the engineering firm Prein&Newhof, to come back with modifications for a May 21 meeting.\nThe original options presented were to build a stairway from \"the plateau,\" or the area just west of the parking lot, through an area called \"the bowl\" and to the beach.\nBoth options offer 220 feet of 5-foot-wide wooden stairs with railings that would be north of where the previous stairs existed.\nOption one:\nThe commission said the first option presented was called the \"Get 'er done approach\" by Levandoski.\nThis option would essentially create a stairway that was a straight line down the dune with nine landings.\nThe cost of the stairway is estimated to be $137,500. However, with the removal of old snow fences and the addition of fencing, the estimated total cost would increase to $163,575.\nOption two:\nThe second option would create a stairway that \"zigzags\" through the dune with resting and viewing balconies and benches.\nThis option is pricier, with an estimated cost of $181,250. With the removal of old snow fences and the addition of fencing, the total estimated cost of this plan comes out to $207,325.\nThe price tag for both options could creep even higher with site restoration costs.\nThe commission said Levandoski also estimated what the total costs could come out to if they added dune grass plantings, shrubs, trees and snow fences. With those costs included, option one's estimate increases to $247,835 and option two's increases to $291,585.\nWith proper maintenance, Levandoski estimated the stairs would last 20-30 years.\nTo help with these costs, the township has around $115,000 of remaining budgeted funds in a capital improvements fund and cost savings. That money could be made available for the project if the board of trustees approves, according to Interim Manager Steven Ringelberg.\nDuring the May 6 meeting, the commission asked Levandoski to come back to their next meeting with modifications made to option one, adding more balconies and benches.\nIn the meantime, as the weather warms up this week, anyone hoping to stop by Laketown Beach Park will face a hike to get to and from the water. The commission asked that parks staff place signs warning visitors of the difficulty they may face getting to and from the beach without stairs.\nThey were also asked to place signs warning beachgoers not to step onto the private property along the sides of the beach to use those stairs.\nThere are no restrictions in place preventing beachgoers from making the climb. However, the parks commission just asks that beachgoers remain on the marked paths to protect the dune.\nThat path is through \"the bowl,\" which has a steep drop with a flat bottom. Beachgoers are asked to stay off the edges of the bowl and avoid disturbing the dune grass.\nIf you decide to visit the beach, you're also asked to heed the no trespassing signs and follow other rules of the beach.",
