  "text": "The National Trust Just Announced Its List of America's Most Endangered Historic Places\nMany of the sites on this year's list are at risk following natural disasters.\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has published its list of the most endangered places in America for 2025, highlighting historic and significant sites across the country in danger of being lost forever. For 38 years now, the National Trust has been issuing the list in effort to build awareness, successfully gaining support for more than 350 sites through community-led preservation. Thanks to their efforts, only a handful have been lost to date.\nThis year’s list features a wide range of sites including towns in the southern region of the nation that were hit by Hurricane Helene and other tropical storms last fall, as well as significant Indigenous heritage landmarks and noteworthy lodges and hotels throughout the country. Here, a closer look at every site on the National Trust’s list of America’s 11 most endangered historic places for 2025.\nSarah DiMarco\nSarah DiMarco (she/her) is the associate editor at VERANDA, where she manages the brand's social media and video strategy. She also writes and edits stories each month, covering topics such as design, architecture, art, gardens, travel, trends, wine, and spirits. Prior to joining VERANDA, she earned her Master's Degree in Magazine, Newspaper, and Online Journalism at Syracuse University.
