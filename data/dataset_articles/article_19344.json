  "text": "Yellowstone National Park constantly warns tourists to remain at least 25 yards away from bison, but every year at least one tourist fails to heed the warning and suffers the consequences. The first person to do so in 2025 was a 47-year-old Florida man who on Sunday approached a bison too closely and was gored around 3:15 p.m. in the Lake Village area of the park, according the National Park Service . The Cape Coral man was fortunate to only have suffered minor injuries. He was treated by emergency medical personnel. The incident is under investigation. Also on FTW Outdoors: Man tries feeding bison near Yellowstone; it doesn’t go well Among the recent incidents involving bison at Yellowstone National Park: In May 2022, a 25-year-old woman was gored by a bison and tossed 10 feet into the air after she approached to within 10 feet of the animal on a boardwalk near Old Faithful. In June 2022, a man walking with his family on a boardwalk near Giant Geyser at Old Faithful was gored by a bison after the family was charged once and did not leave the area. In July 2023, a woman was walking with another individual in front of the Lake Lodge when they saw a bison and began walking away from it. The bison charged and gored the woman, who sustained significant injuries to her chest and abdomen. It wasn’t known how close the individuals were to the bison when it charged. In June 2024, an 83-year-old woman from South Carolina near the Storm Point Trail at Yellowstone Lake suffered serious injuries when a bison, defending its space, came within a few feet of the woman and lifted her about a foot off the ground with its horns. In 2019, Utah State University reported that bison injure more people in Yellowstone than any other wildlife, and the Washington Post reported that half of attacks occur when a tourist attempts to take a photo with a bison, The Guardian reported in 2023. From the National Park Service: “Wild animals can be aggressive if people don’t respect their space. It is your responsibility to stay more than 25 yards (23 meters) away from all large animals – bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes – and at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears and wolves. If wildlife approach you, move away to always maintain these safe viewing distances. “Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans. “Learn more about our safety tips while visiting Yellowstone, including how to behave around wildlife. The safety of these animals – and humans – depends on everyone using good judgment and following these simple rules.\" This article originally appeared on For The Win: Tourist gets too close to a bison in Yellowstone and pays the price",
