  "text": "TIKI ISLAND\nA lightning bolt struck a recreational vehicle during a thunderstorm early Wednesday, causing a fire that killed pets inside, the Tiki Island Fire Department said.\nThe department and Bayou Vista Fire Department responded to a 7 a.m. call at Tiki’s Tom’s RV Park, 4544 Jones Lake Road, officials said. By the time first responders arrived, the RV was completely engulfed in flames, Tiki Island firefighter DeMarcus Foreman said.\nIt took first responders nearly two hours to put out the fire, Foreman said.\n“It just took so long with how much the storm was going on and how much fire was coming out of it,” Foreman said.\nOne person was in the RV when it caught fire, but no injuries were reported, Foreman said. Two cats and one bird that were inside the RV died in the fire.\nNo injuries or cases of smoke inhalation were reported from residents in the park living next to the RV that caught fire, Foreman said.\nThe RV struck by lightning was the only vehicle in the park damaged. The vehicle was destroyed, he said.",
