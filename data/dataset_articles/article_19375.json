  "text": "Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill this week that sought to phase out the use of polystyrene, single-use food containers in the state over the next 4 ½ years.\nHouse Bill 477 would have prohibited restaurants and other food services from using the containers made of polystyrene – better known under its popular brand name Styrofoam – by the start of 2030. Gianforte said the bill amounted to government overreach.\n“Montanans don’t take kindly to federal overreach, and I’m proud we’ve consistently stood up against it. As state government, we should be consistent, actively avoiding such overreach here in Montana,” the governor wrote in his letter vetoing the measure. “Our state should remain a sanctuary for freedom and free enterprise, and let high taxes, high spending, and hyper-regulation remain a feature of deep blue, progressive states.”\nThe polystyrene phase-out under the bill would have started on the first day of 2028, when restaurants would be barred from serving food or drinks in polystyrene containers if they were going to be consumed on site. It would not apply to raw, uncooked meat, eggs or poultry.\nBy the next Jan. 1, restaurants, food establishments, resorts and hotels would not be to serve food or drinks in such containers or provide them as to-go containers. And by Jan. 1, 2030, no food packager in the state could use polystyrene packaging for any type of prepared food or baked goods.\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Marliyn Marler, a Missoula Democrat, provided exemptions that would allow the use of such containers if a restaurant could prove there was no alternative packaging that could be used or if doing away with Styrofoam would cause them “undue hardship.” Other exemptions include if the foam was to be used for transportation, construction, health or safety.\nExplaining the bill to her colleagues throughout its legislative process, Marler said polystyrene has already been proven by researchers and the federal government to be bad for human and environmental health, and that it is bad for Montana’s economy because it is not produced here and can’t be recycled or repurposed.\nMany companies, including some in Montana, have already started producing alternative food containers, she said, also offering that Styrofoam could go the way of the seat belt or pull-off beer tabs.\n“Did we wait for that to just solve itself or did we pass some laws across the country?” Marler told her House colleagues in March. “Well, guess what? It works.”\nMany Republicans who opposed the bill said they already believe polystyrene is being phased out naturally by the free market after years of information showing it is bad for health and the environment. Why put a government-imposed timeline on the phase out, they asked.\nAfter a Senate committee pushed the dates of the phase-out back, the Senate as a whole changed the bill back to its form as it came out of the House, albeit on a narrow 26-24 vote.\nUltimately, despite receiving enough bipartisan support to narrowly pass both chambers, Gianforte had little regard for it. Both in his veto letter and in a video announcing his veto he didn’t want to spend more money for the Department of Environmental Quality to review exception requests or place any more costs on Montana businesses and consumers.\n“The state banning Styrofoam is costly government overreach, and like many Montanans, I enjoy a hot coffee in a Styrofoam cup because it keeps it hot,” the governor said as he sipped coffee out of a cup with a veto stamp on it. “And this bill is a hot mess.”",
