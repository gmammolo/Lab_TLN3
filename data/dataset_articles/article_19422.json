  "text": "The Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 remains one of the most devastating natural disasters in recent history. Triggered by a massive undersea earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, this catastrophic event claimed over 230,000 lives across 14 countries. But what exactly caused such widespread destruction? The earthquake, measuring a staggering 9.1 on the Richter scale, unleashed powerful waves that traveled at speeds up to 500 miles per hour. These waves, known as tsunamis , can cause immense damage when they hit coastal areas. Understanding the impact and aftermath of this disaster is crucial for preparedness and resilience in the face of future tsunamis. Let's dive into 27 compelling facts about the Indian Ocean tsunami that highlight its scale, impact, and the lessons learned.",
