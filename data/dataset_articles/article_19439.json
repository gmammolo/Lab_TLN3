  "text": "Argentina Crop Nutrition Crisis: Millions of Tons Lost Annually BUENOS AIRES — May 9, 2024 — A crisis is unfolding in Argentina as the agricultural sector grapples with significant crop losses due to inefficient fertilization practices. The primary issue is inefficiencies, according to experts who cite a lack of proper soil diagnosis which impacts yields, and leads to a loss of millions of tons of grains annually. Addressing soil management is key; read on.\nArgentina Grapples With Crop Nutrition Crisis: millions of Tons Lost Annually rosario, Argentina – A stark assessment presented at the Fertilizad 2025 symposium has revealed that Argentina’s agricultural sector is losing approximately 40 million tons of grains annually due to inefficient fertilization practices.Despite increased fertilizer usage, critical gaps in soil management and nutrient investment continue to plague the nation’s crop yields.\nThe Root of the Problem: Lack of Soil Diagnosis The symposium,organized by the Fertilizar association,highlighted that inadequate soil diagnosis and insufficient investment in essential nutrients are primary drivers of poor crop nutrition. Roberto Rotandaro,president of Fertilizar AC ,emphasized the urgency of addressing these issues,stating that crop nutrition will be key in the next campaign.\nDid you know? Only 21% of agricultural operations in Argentina conduct nutrient analysis on their soils. This lack of data hinders effective fertilization strategies. Economic Impact and Lost Potential The consequences of poor fertilization extend beyond crop yields, significantly impacting the Argentine economy. Rotandaro pointed out that around 40 million tons of grains ceased to occur due to inefficiency in fertilization. This represents a ample loss of potential revenue and underscores the need for improved soil management practices.\nKey Deficiencies and Opportunities for Enhancement Sulfur Deficiency: Rotandaro noted that the average dose of sulfur today remains just 2 to 3 kilos per hectare. He stressed that sulfur is an economic and efficient nutrient and that increasing its application presents a meaningful prospect for improvement. Corn Production: Gaps in nutrient application are particularly pronounced in corn crops, highlighting the need for targeted fertilization strategies. Pro Tip: Conduct regular soil testing to determine specific nutrient deficiencies. Tailor your fertilization plan based on these results to maximize crop yield and minimize waste. Fertilizer Market Dynamics Argentina’s fertilizer market relies heavily on imports. Rotandaro explained that the country produces a third of the fertilizer that it uses, and the rest is mainly imported from North Africa, the United States, Morocco and Russia. The majority of these imports enter through the port of San Nicolás, followed by San Lorenzo and Rosario.\nThe Role of Advisors and Thorough Soil Management Rotandaro emphasized the critical role of agricultural advisors in disseminating knowledge and promoting effective soil management. He stated that the advisor has to filter and hierarchize the most relevant technologies, based on diagnosis and understand the diversity of the Argentine producer. He also cautioned against focusing solely on nitrogen and phosphorus, urging a broader outlook that includes addressing issues like water and wind erosion, compaction, and flooding. Not everything is nitrogen and phosphorus. We must also talk about water and wind erosion, compaction, floods. Some problems seem from the past, but remain in force he warned.\nreader question: What are the long-term environmental impacts of over-fertilization, and how can these be mitigated? Growth in Biofertilizers and Biostimulants The symposium also highlighted the increasing adoption of biofertilizers and biostimulants in Argentina. Rotandaro noted the strong growth of biofertilizers, which increased their use 25 times in 5 years, and bio -stimulants, by 8. this trend reflects a growing interest in enduring and environmentally friendly agricultural practices.\nCall to Action: A Comprehensive Approach The overarching message from the Fertilizad 2025 symposium is the urgent need for a more comprehensive and efficient approach in soil management. rotandaro concluded by reiterating Fertilizar AC’s mission: Disseminating knowledge about nutrition and soil care for sustainable production. That is what moves us every day.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the main cause of grain loss in Argentina? Inefficient fertilization practices, stemming from a lack of soil diagnosis and insufficient nutrient investment. How much grain is lost annually due to this inefficiency? Approximately 40 million tons. What percentage of Argentine farmers conduct soil nutrient analysis? Only 21%. What is Fertilizar AC’s mission? To disseminate knowledge about nutrition and soil care for sustainable production.",
