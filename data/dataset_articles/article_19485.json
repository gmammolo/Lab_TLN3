  "text": "Ahmedabad has recorded more than 10 inches of unseasonal rainfall in just three days, throwing the city into chaos. The State Emergency Department in Gandhinagar released data showing heavy showers with strong winds and thunderstorms since Monday.\nDespite being May, the city feels more like winter than summer. On Wednesday, Ahmedabad’s maximum temperature dropped to a mere 26.9°C—14.6°C below normal for this time of year. The minimum temperature hovered at 21.2°C, 5.5°C lower than average. The city logged 31.1 mm of rainfall within 24 hours by Tuesday evening. Humidity remained surprisingly high at 96 percent in the morning, falling to 72 percent by evening. Cloudy skies, steady rain and cool winds have transformed the normally scorching city into something unrecognisable for May.\nRainfall across districts\nRain has pounded the entire Ahmedabad division. Monday saw 1.42 inches across the city. Between Tuesday 6 am and Wednesday 6 am, another 2.52 inches fell. Viramgam received 0.83 inches, while Ahmedabad Mandal got 0.57 inches. Detroj-Rampura recorded 0.20 inches, Bavla 0.12 inches, and Dholka 0.08 inches. On Wednesday alone, between 6 am and 4 pm, the city was drenched with a staggering 7.21 inches. Bavla followed with 2.72 inches, Dholera 1.85 inches, and Dholka 1.30 inches. Sanand, Daskroi and Dhandhuka got 0.55 and 0.08 inches.\nTraffic chaos ensues\nSevere waterlogging has brought many parts of Ahmedabad to a standstill. Service lanes along SG Highway–132 Ft Ring Road and areas near GMDC Ground are completely underwater. In Ghatlodia’s Janta Nagar, an AMC garbage truck got stuck in a hidden pothole. Cars in Gota smashed into submerged dividers on the SG Highway service lane. Similar scenes unfolded on Pakwan Road and near Binori Hotel, where abandoned vehicles sat half-submerged.\nStorm damage mounts\nShivranjani Crossroads reported waterlogging on the service road towards IIM-A. The Vejalpur–Makarba road saw an electric pole upended by fierce winds and rain, creating serious safety risks for locals and drivers alike.\nRed alert over deluge\nThe IMD has slapped a red alert on Ahmedabad and nearby districts. The warning covers heavy to very heavy rain, thunderstorms, and winds up to 70 kmph in isolated spots. Anand, Bhavnagar, Valsad, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli are also under red alert.\nBhavnagar worst hit\nThe deluge has hit other parts of Gujarat hard too. Bhavnagar (Mahuva) and Anand have taken the worst beating. Most of Gujarat, including Saurashtra and Kutch, has seen widespread rainfall. North Gujarat experienced the sharpest temperature drop during daylight hours. Southern Gujarat and coastal areas of Saurashtra and Kutch have also remained much cooler than normal.\nRainy till May 14\n“The forecast shows that Ahmedabad and many parts of Gujarat will continue to receive rain till at least May 14,” said an IMD official. “Light to moderate showers with gusty winds are expected across the state over the next three days.” “Rain may ease off slightly by the weekend,” the official added, “but thunderstorms and strong winds will likely continue in some areas.”\nColour-coded warnings\nA red alert has been sounded for Ahmedabad, Anand, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Valsad, Daman and Dadra Nagar Haveli.",
