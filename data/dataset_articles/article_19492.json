  "text": "Thursday could bring showers and a risk of frost overnight across the Greater Toronto Area and southern Ontario.\nEnvironment Canada says the day will begin cloudy with a mix of sun and cloud in Toronto.\nThere’s a 30 per cent chance of showers early in the morning in Mississauga, Brampton, Hamilton, and the Niagara Falls area, turning into a mix of sun and clouds into the afternoon.\nWinds are expected to blow around 20 km/h with gusts up to 40 km/h, the weather agency says.\nConditions are expected to clear into the evening but the temperature could drop to as low as 2 C overnight with a risk of frost.\nBut the warmer weather should return on Friday with the forecast calling for sunny skies and a high of around 18 C in Mississauga.\nLooking ahead to the weekend, Saturday is predicted to see sunny skies and a high of around 22 C, while Sunday could bring a high of around 20 C.",
