  "text": "Trump and Republicans are trying to end the Energy Star program and stop California from phasing out the sale of new gas vehicles. On EVs, they enjoy some Democratic support.\nCA school districts are paying a hefty sum for on-campus police. Little oversight exists on how those dollars are spent and how officers behave inside campus gates.\nPopular LA evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson was reportedly kidnapped and held prisoner in Mexico in the 1920s, then fled on foot through the desert. A new book traces her story.",
