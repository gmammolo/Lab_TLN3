  "text": "Water rose as quickly as the rain fell, in Herkimer, Tuesday afternoon. Streets were almost instantly submerged. The force of all that water packed sewer pipes with gravel, branches and all kinds of debris, poured in through the street gutters.\n\"A couple inches in an hour is a lot,\" said Village DPW Superintendent, Justin Cristman. \"We just don't have the system to handle that all at once. It washed a lot of gravel down in pipes.\"\nThe Village DPW called it quits around 10:00 Tuesday night and was back at it around 5:30 Wednesday morning, with the industrial-strength equivalent of a Shop Vac.\n\"It's just sucking all the debris up to then let us...there's another machine down there called a jet machine, that's got high-pressure water that pulls... you start at the bottom and pull all the gravel down back to that machine through the pipes,\" said Superintendent Cristman.\nVillage and town DPW and highway crews were also out opening culverts. Because it's not just about cleaning up after this time, but getting ready for next time.\n\"Clean-up wise, street wise, it's not terrible. It's getting everything dug back, set up for the next event,\" said Superintendent Cristman.\nIt'll be a few more 12-hour days to get everything cleaned up and cleared out.",
