  "text": "MONROE, La. (KNOE) - Residents and institutions in South Monroe are recovering after a severe storm Tuesday left homes damaged and power out across the region, with Richwood bearing the brunt.\nAt Greater Free Gift Baptist Church, Bishop Rodney McFarland reported significant damage to both the interior and exterior of the building.\n“As you’ve seen, there is quite a bit of damage inside, and still more we haven’t assessed due to the power outage,” McFarland said. “We’re now trying to reach a roofing company to tarp the holes.”\nChurch events planned for later this week are postponed, but Sunday worship will take place at the Emily P. Robinson Recreation Center.\nSeveral schools, including Richwood Middle and High School, were closed due to outages. Residents also reported severe damage to homes.\n“The window started banging, everything came through the roof,” said Anna, a local resident. “I had to crawl to the bedroom and hide under a mattress. A tree fell through the kitchen—when I moved, the floor just gave out.”\nOfficials urge displaced residents to contact the Red Cross at 1-800-RED-CROSS for shelter and assistance.",
