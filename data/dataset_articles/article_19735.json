  "text": "AU SABLE FORKS, N.Y. (WCAX) – The blooming tulips and lilies may smell good right now, but the prices for those and other flowers may soon stink. Flower wholesalers in the Adirondack region are among those in the industry who say Trump administration tariffs are adding more than 13 percent in added costs for bulb imports.\nLinda D’Arco, the owner of Ampersand Bulb Company in Au Sable Forks, points to dozens of crates sourced directly from the Netherlands. She says bulbs from the country make up roughly 98 percent of their inventory during the summer and fall months. However, a blanket 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States is uprooting her blooming business.\n“Right now, we should be ordering bulbs for delivery next January. We aren’t. Not quite sure what the interest will be from our customers because the market is so volatile,” D’Arco said.\nAlready, she says the tariffs are doubling their fees at customs, with price hikes expected to reflect in the next few months. “The consumer is going to be feeling those shortly. The first price hikes of cut flowers will be happening this summer as the summer’s crops of lilies start to bloom.”\nD’Arco says the higher costs have already translated into fewer sales, forcing her to make pay cuts and avoid bringing in part-time help this summer. “I don’t see this is much sustainable than half a year or a full year,” she said. “It would just be so nice to have stability again, to know what is coming and to plan for that, and we just don’t have that right now.”",
