  "text": "Explainer: Depts penalised for discharging untreated effluents into drains\nThe Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has imposed environmental compensation (EC) on various government departments for discharging untreated effluents into drains that further end up in the Ghaggar river.\nWho were penalised by the state pollution control board?\nThe HSPCB has imposed the environmental compensation of Rs 6 crore on the Ambala Municipal Corporation, the Public Health Engineering Department and the Rural and Panchayat Development Department for discharging untreated effluents into Ambala and Ghail drains. The departments have been directed to deposit the amount in their proportionate share of the compensation. The environmental compensation of Rs 5 lakh per month per drain was imposed for the monitoring period of 60 months from April 2020 to March 2025.\nHow the discharge of untreated effluents affects environment?\nThe drains were carrying untreated effluents generated from residential areas and commercial establishments. As per the report of the HSPCB, continuous monitoring by the board’s Regional Office and subsequent lab analyses confirmed that the effluents in both drains exceeded the permissible limits set by the Ministry of Environment and Forests under the Primary Water Quality Criteria for Bathing Waters.\nWhat were the lapses observed by the pollution control board?\nThe pollution board found various lapses, including incomplete sewerage networks in the catchment areas, lack of 100% domestic sewer connections, unauthorised discharge of effluents from commercial establishments and households, poor maintenance of the existing sewer systems and overflow from manholes.\nOn whose directions is the compensation being charged?\nAs per the orders of the National Green Tribunal, all local bodies or the departments concerned have to ensure 100% sewage treatment. In default, the entities need to pay compensation, which is to be recovered by the states/UTs. The CPCB is to collect the compensation and utilise it for restoration of environment. The ECs were imposed after a field survey, mapping of the drains and analysis of effluents by a joint committee constituted by the Ambala DC.\nWhat directions have been issued to departments?\nThe departments concerned have been directed to expedite the work of tapping and diverting the untreated discharge. They have been asked to deposit the compensation amount within 15 days to avoid legal action. As per Ajay Malik, regional officer of the HSPCB, Ambala, the matter was further discussed with the higher authorities and there were directions to take measures and action to ensure compliance with the NGT guidelines.",
