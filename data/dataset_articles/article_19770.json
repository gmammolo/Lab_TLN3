  "text": "Thai provinces braced for storms and heavy rain\nStorm conditions worsen with risk of severe winds and flooding\nThe Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) has issued a weather forecast, predicting thunderstorms and strong winds across 40 provinces, including Bangkok, with heavy rainfall expected in the southern region covering 60% of the area. Residents are advised to exercise caution due to severe weather conditions today, May 8.\nIn the next 24 hours, the upper part of Thailand will experience thunderstorms and strong winds in some areas, with generally hot weather and extreme heat in certain parts of the north. This is due to the southwest and southerly winds bringing moisture over the region.\nIn the south, although rainfall is decreasing, heavy showers are still anticipated on the western coast. Residents should be vigilant of possible flash floods, particularly in areas near mountains and waterways. The Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand are expected to have waves around 1 metre high and over 2 metres during thunderstorms, prompting a warning for maritime activities.\nFrom tomorrow, May 9, to May 12, upper Thailand will be affected by summer storms, including thunderstorms, strong winds, hail, and heavy rain in some places. These conditions will initially impact the northeast before spreading to other regions.\nThis weather pattern is attributed to a moderate high-pressure system from China affecting Vietnam and the South China Sea, combined with the hot to extremely hot weather in upper Thailand.\nDust and haze accumulation in upper Thailand remains moderate due to scattered rainfall.\nWeather forecasts\nNorthern Thailand will be generally hot, with some areas experiencing extreme heat. Thunderstorms are expected in 20% of the area, mainly in Chiang Mai, Sukhothai, Tak, Kamphaeng Phet, Phitsanulok, and Phetchabun. Temperatures will range from 23 to 28°C, with highs of 37 to 40°C.\nIn the northeast, hot weather prevails with thunderstorms in 30% of the area, particularly in Loei, Nong Khai, Bueng Kan, Udon Thani, Sakon Nakhon, Nakhon Phanom, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen, Mukdahan, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Buriram. Temperatures will vary between 23 and 27°C, with highs of 34 and 38°C.\nThe central region will also face hot weather, with thunderstorms in 30% of the area, mainly in Nakhon Sawan, Uthai Thani, Chai Nat, Lop Buri, Saraburi, Kanchanaburi, and Ratchaburi. Temperatures will be from 25 to 28°C, with highs of 36 to 38°C.\nThe eastern region will be hot with thunderstorms in 40% of the area, particularly in Nakhon Nayok, Prachin Buri, Chachoengsao, Chon Buri, Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Trat. Temperatures will range from 25 to 28°C, with highs of 33 to 37°C. The sea will have waves about 1 metre high, increasing to over 2 metres in stormy areas.\nIn the south (east coast), thunderstorms will cover 40% of the area, mainly in Chumphon, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Phatthalung, with temperatures from 23 to 26°C and highs of 34 to 36°C.\nThe south (west coast) will experience thunderstorms in 60% of the area, with heavy rain in Ranong, Phang Nga, Phuket, and Krabi. Temperatures will vary from 24 to 26°C, with highs of 29 to 33°C.\nBangkok and surrounding areas will be generally hot, with thunderstorms in 30% of the area, temperatures ranging from 26 to 28°C, and highs of 34 to 36°C, reported KhaoSod.\nLatest Thailand News\nFollow The Thaiger on Google News:",
