  "text": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, is closing several popular parks and recreation areas due to staffing shortages. Closures include Fishhook Park, Ice Harbor Visitor Center, and Illia Dunes, with service reductions at McNary, Lucky Peak, and Dworshak. A federal hiring freeze, recently extended until July, has prevented the Corps from filling vacant park ranger positions. WALLA WALLA, Wash. - If you've been planning outdoor activities at local parks and recreation areas this season, you may need to reconsider your options. Due to staffing shortages, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, has announced significant closures and service reductions at several popular outdoor destinations. The Corps is shutting down multiple parks and facilities to redirect limited staff and funding to priority areas. Fishhook Park, Ice Harbor Visitor Center, and the popular Illia Dunes are among the closures. \"Primarily, we're dealing with a staffing shortage,\" said Dylan Peters, spokesperson for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District. \"We had some vacant park ranger positions in the district coming into this year. Since Januar,y we've been under a federal hiring freeze. That hiring freeze was recently extended until July.\" The staffing constraints have forced difficult decisions about which areas to close. \"We chose some sites just due to their location and to limit the range of our patrols,\" Peters explained. Beyond complete closures, visitors should expect reduced services at all project areas, including McNary, Lucky Peak, and Dworshak. These reductions include less frequent cleanups and limited trash collection. The Corps has not provided a timeline for when these areas might reopen, stating that closures will remain in effect \"until further notice.\" For those still hoping to enjoy outdoor recreation this season, officials recommend checking the Corps' website before heading out to confirm which areas remain open and what services are available. Visitors to open areas should plan to pack out their trash and prepare for fewer amenities than in previous years. The \"know before you go\" principle is especially important this season, as conditions and availability may change. While the natural landscapes aren't closed, these staffing limitations affect access points and managed recreation areas. The situation highlights the impact of federal hiring freezes on public services, particularly those related to outdoor recreation and natural resource management. The Corps manages numerous regional recreation areas that provide access to water-based activities, hiking, camping, and other outdoor pursuits. These areas typically see increased visitation during the spring and summer months. Officials have not indicated whether alternative management arrangements, such as partnerships with local governments or volunteer organizations, are being considered to help maintain access to these popular recreation spots. For the most current information on closures and service reductions, visit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District website, or contact their office directly before planning outdoor activities.
