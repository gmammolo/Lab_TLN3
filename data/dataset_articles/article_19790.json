  "text": "Industry- 3 min read\nIs there a new global health threat? Fungal superbugs spread panic with climate change expanding its reach\nExperts have noted that changing climate patterns, wildfires, and dust storms likely expand the fungi’s geographic reach. Reportedly, cases of Coccidioides infection have been reported in over 20 US states, including regions which previously were unaffected.\nA new global health threat is emerging—drug-resistant\nTorrence Irvin from California became critically ill after he unknowingly inhaled the spores. Doctors took nearly a year to correctly diagnose him. However, by that time, he had lost a significant amount of weight and nearly died.\nAs per a CNN report, another survivor Rob Purdie contracted fungal meningitis after he inhaled spores while gardening and now depends on lifelong toxic treatments.\nAnother dangerous fungus causes lung issues\nWHO lists 19 fungal species as urgent priorities\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) reportedly has enlisted nearly 6.5 million invasive fungal infections. This, they said, results in 3.8 million deaths globally each year and the numbers are climbing due to increasing drug resistance.\nThey listed 19 fungal species under urgent priorities for new drug development, among which Aspergillus fumigatus is one. Other dangerous species include Cryptococcus neoformans (deadly meningitis),\nThe CNN report stated that developing antifungal drugs is especially challenging since fungi are genetically closer to humans than bacteria. This means, the treatments can harm human cells, which could result in kidney failure, liver damage, or other severe side effects.\nDr Neil Clancy, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at University of Pittsburgh, told CNN that if an antifungal drug is being made, it is crucial to come up with formulations that will not harm genes and human proteins.\nClimate change could exacerbate the spread\nExperts have noted that changing climate patterns, wildfires, and dust storms likely expand the fungi’s geographic reach. Reportedly, cases of Coccidioides infection have been reported in over 20 US states, including regions which previously were unaffected.\nThe study on Aspergillus fumigatus stated it could expand across an additional 77 per cent of global territory by 2100 as climate change is accelerated. Researchers have estimated that 9 million people in Europe alone could be exposed to infection risks if fungus takes hold.\nReportedly, the fungus can grow rapidly in compost at high temperatures and can survive the human body’s internal heat of 37°C. It was also found thriving in extreme environments like Chernobyl’s nuclear reactors.\nUrgent need for antifungal innovation\nExperimental drugs like Olorofim offer hope, however, experts have warned that limited specialist access and lack of public awareness could leave many patients untreated or misdiagnosed. More research, better treatments, and physician training are urgently needed to confront this growing fungal superbug threat, stated the CNN report.\nProfessor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University, said that the development of new antifungal treatments has been slow. One key reason, as per an NDTV report, is financial unattractiveness of investing in antifungal medicines.\nReportedly, the antifungal medicines are costly to develop and often spotted as less profitable compared to others in drug market.\nfungal infections. These microscopic fungal spores likeCoccidioides, responsible forvalley fever, are infecting people who inhale them from air or soil, even in their own backyards.Torrence Irvin from California became critically ill after he unknowingly inhaled the spores. Doctors took nearly a year to correctly diagnose him. However, by that time, he had lost a significant amount of weight and nearly died.\nAs per a CNN report, another survivor Rob Purdie contracted fungal meningitis after he inhaled spores while gardening and now depends on lifelong toxic treatments.\nAnother dangerous fungus causes lung issues\nAspergillus fumigatus, another dangerous fungus, could spread across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and will affect millions of vulnerable individuals. This fungus, a study said, thrives in warm, damp environments and could potentially infect people by invading their lungs, particularly those who have underlying health issues like asthma, cystic fibrosis, or weakened immune systems.WHO lists 19 fungal species as urgent priorities\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) reportedly has enlisted nearly 6.5 million invasive fungal infections. This, they said, results in 3.8 million deaths globally each year and the numbers are climbing due to increasing drug resistance.\nThey listed 19 fungal species under urgent priorities for new drug development, among which Aspergillus fumigatus is one. Other dangerous species include Cryptococcus neoformans (deadly meningitis),\nCandida auris(highly drug-resistant hospital infections) and Candida albicans (common yeast that can become invasive).The CNN report stated that developing antifungal drugs is especially challenging since fungi are genetically closer to humans than bacteria.
