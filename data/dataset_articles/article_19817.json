  "text": "Fire on the Cherne-1 platform leads IBP to suspend Petrobras inspections in the Campos Basin; the unit has been operating for 40 years, twice its expected useful life.\nA recent fire in Cherne-1 platform, located in the Campos dos Goytacazes Basin (RJ), led the Brazilian Institute of Oil and Gas (IBP) to suspend, as a precautionary measure, Petrobras' Equipment Inspection Management System (SPIE) in the Campos Basin Business Unit (UN-BC).\nThe measure, although temporary, imposed immediate restrictions on the state-owned company's operations until the causes of the accident are determined, the severity of which has reignited discussions about the structural integrity of offshore units that have exceeded their designed useful life.\nCherne-1 platform structure exceeds safe operating limit\nPreliminary technical reports indicate that the Cherne-1 platform, originally designed to operate for 20 years, has already been in operation for four decades — twice the predicted time.\nThis discrepancy between the planned useful life and the operational reality is one of the central concerns of the technical committee investigating the accident.\nThe structural deterioration of the unit is being thoroughly analyzed, with a focus on possible failures that may have contributed to the fire.\nMeanwhile, the IBP demands from Petrobras a corrective action plan to regain full certification.\nIBP applies suspension based on technical standards\nAccording to item 4.16 of the guidelines regulating the SPIE, the precautionary suspension can be determined whenever a major accident occurs, such as the one recorded at Cherne-1.\nThe measure was adopted in accordance with the opinion of the Certification Commission (ComCer), which will deliberate on the maintenance of the certificate between May 13th and 15th.\nItem 11.5 of the standard also establishes that the SPIE certificate must remain suspended until a conclusive investigation report is submitted to the Product Certification Body (OCP).\nComCer's final decision will also consider information forwarded by supervisory bodies of the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE).\nPetrobras maintains operational routines and safety on board\nIn an official statement, Petrobras reported that the precautionary suspension “is an administrative measure and does not impact inspection and maintenance activities already underway on the platform.”\nThe company reinforced that the established routines continue to be followed “to maintain the habitability and safety conditions of Cherne I, in accordance with current regulations”.\nFurthermore, the state-owned company highlighted that it was formally notified by the IBP and that it awaits the conclusion of the investigation report for ComCer's deliberations.\nThree workers remain hospitalized in stable health condition\nThe incident also left people injured. According to Petrobras, three workers remain hospitalized, being clinically monitored, with their health condition considered stable.\nThe case of the Cherne-1 platform reinforces the need for greater oversight of aging structures in the oil and gas sector.\nThe continuity of operations in platforms that exceed their useful life without adequate modernizations can pose increasing risks.",
