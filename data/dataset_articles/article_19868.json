  "text": "GB News\nPublished: 07/05/2025- 22:47\nThe 266-acre site is just yards from the village's local primary school\nTrending on GB News\nLocals in the Yorkshire village where Guy Fawkes once lived have expressed their fears for a \"toxic\" new lithium battery site - just yards from the local primary school.\nResidents in the picturesque Yorkshire village of Scotton have expressed outrage at plans for a substantial 266-acre Percy Beck solar farm with connected lithium-ion battery energy storage systems.\nThe lithium-ion batteries are designed to store electricity generated from renewable sources like solar and wind farms - but could explode, producing deadly clouds of hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid.\nDiscussing the planned site on GB News, Scotton local Lee Gardener hit out at the \"ridiculous\" plans, and argued that the village \"cannot cope\" with any more traffic.\nLee Gardener has expressed his fears for a new lithium battery site in his Yorkshire village\nTrip Advisor, GB News\nGardener explained: \"It's absolutely massive. And the problem is that the infrastructure of the village can't cope with any more traffic. There's a certain section of the village where you've got to go single file, where the school is.\n\"It's on a T-junction, and we can't even get a crossing on the school. So the extra traffic and the workload for the solar farm is going to be colossal.\"\nNoting the proximity of the planned site to the village's primary school, Gardener stressed that his own daughter is \"scared\" of the site being so close to her school.\nGardener said: \"Where the battery storage units are going to be, it's just far too close to the school. There's two lithium battery storage units that they want to put in and cater for the 266 acre site, it's ridiculous.\n\"My daughter is scared, to be honest with you. And the problem is, because it's such a small school, they don't have playing fields - they've got to go across the road into the football pitches. They're worried, they don't know what's going to happen. Nobody's come to speak to the kids at the school.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\nThe site would be just yards from the village's primary school\nYouTube\nWhen asked by host Martin Daubney if there was a \"consultation process\", Gardener claimed there was a meeting with \"PR people\" for the company, but they were given \"no real answers\".\nGardener explained: \"We haven't had any risk assessments, we've had no information whatsoever. There was an information evening and there was just PR people there, there was nobody there from any of the energy companies, so we couldn't get any real answers.\n\"There should be people going into the school and saying this is what's proposed, this is the safety factors, and just explain things to the kids because they don't understand it. And as parents, we don't really understand it, so it's just mental. It's just crazy. It's just preposterous.\"\nHitting out at the drive for net zero pushed by the Labour Government, Gardener claimed they are trying to \"jump on the bandwagon\", and local authorities are \"scared to say no to green\".\nGardener concluded: \"Part of the problem is everybody wants to jump on the bandwagon, and that the councils are so scared to say no to green. They're letting everything go, and everybody's trying to get a piece of that pie.\nGardener told GB News that the plans are 'preposterous'\nGB News\n\"I'm all for renewable energy and green energy, but why take any more of our countryside? Our countryside has been lost enough to like new houses, housing developments, so why can't they put it on the put the solar panels on the new houses?\"\nHe added: \"They're not taking into account anybody's neighbourhoods, anybody's lifestyles, they just think net zero. Net zero, let's do it, let's do it. And the aftermath is going to be phenomenal, because these solar farms are huge. And what happens to the panels after that? How green are they?\"\nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"We are helping builders get shovels in the ground quicker to build the vital infrastructure we need, so we can improve transport links and make Britain a clean energy superpower to protect bill payers.\n\"Our Planning and Infrastructure Bill will deliver a win-win for the economy and nature – fixing the failing system we inherited which has blocked economic growth while doing nothing for nature’s recovery.\"",
