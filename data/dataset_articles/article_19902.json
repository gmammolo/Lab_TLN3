  "text": "Taarek Refaat Oil prices fell on Wednesday, after rebounding from a sharp sell-off earlier in the week, as investors shifted their focus to US-China trade talks this weekend.\nBrent crude futures fell 71 cents, or about 1.14%, to $61.44 a barrel by end of trading, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 66 cents, or 1.12%, to $58.43 a barrel.\nLatest Oil Prices:\nWTI Crude $58.07 -1.73%\nBrent Crude $60.96 -1.91%\nMurban Crude $61.56 -1.28%\nLouisiana Light $62.57 +3.32%\nBonny Light $78.62 -2.84%\nOpec Basket $61.81 +3.26%\nMars US $72.57 -1.48%\nGasoline $2.028 -1.78%\nNatural Gas $3.621 +4.56%\nBoth benchmarks fell to four-year lows this week after OPEC+ decided to accelerate production increases, raising concerns of oversupply at a time when US tariffs have heightened demand concerns.\nThe United States and China are scheduled to meet in Switzerland, which could be the first step toward resolving a trade war that is disrupting the global economy.\nThe US-China trade talks come after weeks of escalating tensions, which have seen tariffs on imported goods between the world's two largest economies rise sharply, exceeding 100%.\nInvestors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve's next policy update on Wednesday, where they expect the key interest rate to remain in the 4.25%-4.50% range until the Fed's meeting on July 29-30.",
