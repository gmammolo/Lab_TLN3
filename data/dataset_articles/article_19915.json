  "text": "Turkiye’s top court upholds law on culling of stray dogs\nTurkiye’s top court on Wednesday rejected a request to annul a contentious law designed to remove millions of stray dogs from the streets, which criticssaid could lead to mass killings of the animals.

The Constitutional Court, however, has ruled that the provisions are legally valid and for it to continue to be implemented.
