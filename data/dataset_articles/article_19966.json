  "text": "<p>Mumbai: To highlight and address the issue of mounting consequences of climate change, its impact on food systems has become a global emergency, the Regional Policy Dialogue on Climate Change & Its Impact on Agriculture will be held in Bhopal. </p><p>From unpredictable rainfall to rising temperatures, climate volatility is already reshaping agriculture across continents. In this urgent context, India, home to over 100 million farmers, is witnessing increasingly erratic monsoons, declining yields, and worsening water stress.</p><p>Sustainability Matters and IndiAgri is hosting the day-long session on May 10.</p><p>The dialogue follows the Sustainable Agriculture Summit & Awards 2024, held in <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/delhi\">Delhi</a> in August 2024, and reflects a growing consensus that climate adaptation in agriculture is not a choice but a necessity. Experts warn that India’s food systems face an existential threat with major declines predicted in yields of rainfed crops like rice by 2050 and beyond if urgent adaptive strategies are not adopted.</p><p>“Indian agriculture stands at a crossroads. What we need now is not incremental change, but a bold recalibration of policy and practice. This dialogue is a step in that direction,” said Dr Navneet Anand, Executive Director, Sustainability Matters.</p>.Patanjali's Impact on Indian Agriculture: A Game Changer for the Future.<p>Dr Anand informed that hosting the dialogue in Madhya Pradesh is a deliberate and strategic choice. </p><p>“As a state where over 70 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture, <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/madhya-pradesh\">Madhya Pradesh</a> plays a critical role in India’s food security matrix. Its extensive cultivation of wheat, pulses, and oilseeds makes it a bellwether for understanding how climate risks could ripple through national supply chains,” said Dr Anand.</p><p>The one-day event will feature two focused panel discussions titled; ‘Climate-Resilient Agriculture: Adapting to Changing Weather Patterns’ and ‘Sustainable Water Management in Agriculture: Conservation and Productivity’. Many experts including policymakers, agriculture scientists, agri-startup founders, progressive farmers, farmers producers organisations, and grassroots practitioners will join the discussion. An award ceremony will also be held to honour and felicitate those who have made contributions in sustainable agriculture. </p><p>“Solidaridad is proud to support this initiative as a sustainability partner. We bridge global climate commitments with local agricultural realities. The need of the hour is to support farmers not only with knowledge, but also with systems that enable sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices,” added Dr Suresh Motwani, General Manager, Solidaridad.</p><p>“Policy interventions must be grounded in science, but responsive to the realities of our farmers,” said Dr Jay G Varshney, Former Director of the Directorate of Weed Research, ICAR.</p>\n<p>Mumbai: To highlight and address the issue of mounting consequences of climate change, its impact on food systems has become a global emergency, the Regional Policy Dialogue on Climate Change & Its Impact on Agriculture will be held in Bhopal. </p><p>From unpredictable rainfall to rising temperatures, climate volatility is already reshaping agriculture across continents.
