  "text": "April's Alarming Heat: A Glimpse into Our Warming World\nApril 2025 was the second hottest on record, with global temperatures 1.51°C above pre-industrial levels. Human activities, mainly fossil fuel burning, contribute to this warming, causing severe climate impacts. Continuous climate monitoring is essential for understanding these changes.\n- Country:\n- India\nLast month's global temperatures reached new heights, marking the period as the second-warmest April recorded, according to Copernicus, Europe's climate agency.\nThe average surface air temperature was 14.96°C, exceeding the 1991–2020 norm for April by 0.60°C, trailing only behind April 2024 by 0.07°C.\nWith these alarming temperatures, experts reiterate that human-induced climate change, primarily through fossil fuel combustion, demands urgent global action to mitigate increasingly extreme weather events.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nAdvertisement",
