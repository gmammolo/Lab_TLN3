Proposals for three beef rearing units at Westwood Hall Farm in Leek were first submitted in 2023, prompting dozens of objections from residents concerned over the noise and smell that would be created by hundreds of cows.\nOfficers at Staffordshire Moorlands District Council recommended the 'inappropriate' scheme for refusal, but the applicant asked for the item to be withdrawn from the planning committee agenda so further work could be done. Under the revised plans, only one of the three buildings is designated a beef rearing unit, with the other two now being for the storage of hay and agricultural equipment.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement According to the proposals, the cow shed would be used to house a maximum of 144 cattle at any one time. But all three buildings will be of a 'similar form', with the cow shed and one of the hay storage buildings 660 square metres in size, and the third building 555 square metres.\nRead More: Council set to approve Staffordshire's newest mosque\nPlanning officers at SMDC have recommended the applications for approval, saying their previous concerns have now been addressed. The planning committee will consider the applications at their meeting on Thursday. The original proposals received 58 objections from members of the public, who raised concerns over housing so many animals near people's homes and schools, as well as the impact on nearby roads.\nWestwood Hall Farm sits in the Green Belt, between Westwood College and homes off Westwood Park Drive. SMDC has received a further 10 objections to the revised plans, with residents saying that despite the reduced number of cows they still have the same concerns over effluent discharge, noise and traffic.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In his objection, Leek West councillor Philip Barks states: \"Even though the applicant has submitted a transport statement and revised cattle density plan, I still believe the development poses a significant negative impact on the neighbouring area, residents' quality of life and safety concerns for pupils at Westwood College, in spite of the reduction in cattle. The development would still amount to a significant business intensification within a residential area and a distinct change to the green belt and landscape character, which is at odds with the local plan.\n\"The developments' physical size has not been altered, yet the business model has been significantly reduced. It concerns me that if permission is granted, there is still the potential to increase cattle density on site, irrespective of the proposals.\"\nLeek Town Council is also maintaining its objection to the proposals, saying there has been 'no significant improvement'.\nIn their report to the planning committee, officers say that while the development will still lead to increased traffic, with the revised proposals for hay and equipment storage there is now 'much less likelihood of a constant intensification'.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Similarly, the report on the cow shed application says that while the development will lead to noise and odours, they would be 'unlikely to be so intense as to make living or working conditions of nearby occupiers unacceptable'.\nThe report states: \"For this single additional livestock rearing building it is considered that such impacts as may have a potential to cause nuisance or other adverse impacts such as arising from odours (and thereby potentially flies), noise, drainage and water quality can be addressed by condition or are otherwise found likely to be acceptable.\"\nGet daily headlines and breaking news emailed to you - it’s FREE\nAdvertisement About our ads",
