  "text": "By Shawn Cabbagestalk ,\n2 hours ago\nNORTH AUGUSTA, S.C. (WJBF) – North Augusta is looking to buy land at Riverside Village to build a cyber office hub using state settlement money.\nThe city is negotiating to buy one of the last open sites in Riverside Village for a new cyber facility, but the site’s proximity to Brick Pond Park is raising environmental concerns.\n“If you look Brick Pond Park a couple of years ago had nice wetlands around it and lots of develop, now it’s all apartment complexes,” said Tonya Bonitatibus, executive director of Savannah Riverkeeper.\nThe property sits just west of the Center Street roundabout. Engineers say the site could support an 80-thousand-square-foot building.\nThe city would own it and lease to cyber tenants.\n“I think, the last big chunk of remaining land that doesn’t have a building on it around around the ponds,” Bonitatibus said.\nSavannah Riverkeeper Tonya Bonitatibus says the site isn’t just another open lot, it’s the last buffer protecting Brick Pond Park’s stormwater system.\n“You can’t turn the whole thing into concrete. You have to have room for your storm water retain on site and not just be rushed directly into the pond,” she said.\nThe group says the city needs a clear plan for managing stormwater as development tightens the space that once held and filtered the rain.\n“How are they gonna get rid of that storm water if the space that used to hold the rainwater is now all buildings? I think the quick answer to that is increased flooding,” Bonitatibus said.\nThe plan replaces earlier proposals for townhomes and retail and moves Riverside Village closer to full build-out.\n“I think there’s probably a pretty expansive review that needs to happen what is North Augusta doing to its riverfront in that community? And is that really what the taxpayers want,” Bonitatibus asked.\nThe next few months will bring more negotiations, planning commission decisions, and a formal Council vote.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
