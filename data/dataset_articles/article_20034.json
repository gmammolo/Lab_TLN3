Get in touch at eoin.mccaul@newsquest.co.uk\nRon Thatcher, of the Bolton Ramblers, was consulted by officers and he said he raised concerns about the path during the application to build 20 houses off Longsight Lane – which was appealed after the council’s refusal, with a decision to be made by the planning inspectorate.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He said the application to record the path’s width “would go some way” to meeting his “concerns about the public right of way”.",
