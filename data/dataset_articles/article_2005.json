  "text": "A man convicted of killing a 15-year-old girl in Hingham before fleeing to Canada is set to be released by the state’s parole board — a decision that has ‘outraged’ the DA whose office put the murderer in jail.\nRoger Francis, 78, who has served 44 years in prison, has been granted parole by the Massachusetts Parole Board.\nWhen Francis was 20 years old in 1967, he shot and killed 15-year-old Marialice Pike. A Mass State Police trooper found her unconscious in the median strip on Route 3, and she later died from her injuries.\nFrancis ended up fleeing to Canada, where he was apprehended on a warrant.\n“Roger Francis’ heinous actions nearly 60 years ago deprived 15-year-old Marialice Pike and her family of a lifetime of memories,” Plymouth DA Timothy Cruz said in a statement. “Francis viciously shot and killed Marialice before fleeing the country in March 1967, showing a clear consciousness of the severity of his actions and a fear of the consequences.”\nThe Plymouth DA’s Office opposed Francis’ petition for parole.\n“Francis may have been 20 years old when he killed Marialice, but the callousness he showed during and after her murder make clear that his release is not a benefit to our community,” Cruz said. “I am outraged that once again, the state Parole Board has chosen to grant parole to a murder defendant.\n“Instead of unanimously deciding that Francis is rehabilitated and ready to release into society, I call upon the Parole Board to instead consider their obligations to victims like Marialice and their families, before allowing people like Francis to walk among us,” the DA added.\nWhen Francis was arrested, he reportedly told police, “I’ve been expecting you fellows,” and asked if the girl was still alive. When police told him that she died, Francis asked officers if he would “get the chair for first degree.”\nHe was convicted of first-degree murder, and at the time he received the mandatory penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nBut then Francis became parole eligible following the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision on emerging adults. The court ruled that sentencing individuals who were ages 18 through 20 at the time of the offense to life without the possibility of parole is unconstitutional. As a result of the SJC’s decision, Francis was resentenced to life with the possibility of parole after 15 years.\n“Mr. Francis has had an extraordinarily positive adjustment throughout his incarceration, with no disciplinary reports, and has held positions of great trust,” the parole board wrote. “He has invested in self-development and maintains a significant support system.\n“The Board considered the expert forensic evaluation and opinion of Dr. Leonard Bard, who stated Mr. Francis is at very low risk of re-offending,” the parole board wrote, adding, “The Board considered public testimony in rendering its opinion, including opposition from Plymouth County Assistant District Attorney Karen Palumbo. The Board concludes by unanimous decision that Mr. Francis has demonstrated a level of rehabilitation that would make his release compatible with the welfare of society.”\nThe special conditions of his parole include: approving home plans before his release; supervising for drugs with testing in accordance with agency policy; supervising for liquor abstinence with testing in accordance with agency policy; requiring mental health counseling; and no contact with the victim’s family.\nPlymouth DA Timothy Cruz (Herald file)",
