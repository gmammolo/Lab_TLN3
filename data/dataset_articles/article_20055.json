  "text": "Japan megaquake warning: Should India brace for the Great Himalayan Earthquake?\nThe \"Great Himalayan Earthquake\" refers to a hypothetical, massive seismic event that could occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust, a major fault line running beneath the Himalayan mountain range.\nRecent warnings from Japan about a looming megaquake have reignited concerns about the potential for a catastrophic earthquake in the Himalayan region.\nWhile Japan faces the threat of a massive seismic event due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, experts in India are now drawing parallels to the Himalayas, a region that has long been considered a ticking time bomb for a great earthquake.\nWHAT IS THE GREAT HIMALAYAN EARTHQUAKE?\nThe \"Great Himalayan Earthquake\" refers to a hypothetical, massive seismic event that could occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust, a major fault line running beneath the Himalayan mountain range.\nThis region is where the Indian tectonic plate is slowly but relentlessly pushing under the Eurasian plate, building up immense stress over centuries.\nWhen this stress is finally released, it could trigger a quake of magnitude 8 or higher—an event capable of devastating large parts of northern India, Nepal, and neighbouring regions.\nSuch a quake is feared because of the Himalayas' dense population, fragile infrastructure, and the potential for widespread landslides and avalanches. Historical records and geological studies show that the region has experienced several major quakes in the past, including the 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake (magnitude 8.0) and the 2015 Nepal earthquake (magnitude 7.8), both of which caused significant loss of life and destruction.\nSHOULD INDIA BE WORRIED?\nAccording to Dr Om Prakash Mishra, Director of the National Centre for Seismology, the Himalayas may currently be acting as a natural safety valve.\nHe explained, “At the moment, it seems the Himalayas are protecting us as it is slowly releasing the stress building deep within the planet by small-sized quakes from time to time. These are M2.5-3.5 quakes that don’t do much damage but largely release the overbuilt stress within the fractures and the tectonic plates. So, at the moment, we need not worry about the great Himalayan earthquake.”\nThis process, known as \"aseismic creep\" or stress release through minor tremors, is seen as a buffer against a sudden, catastrophic rupture. Still, scientists caution that the underlying tectonic forces remain unchanged, and the risk of a major earthquake cannot be ruled out in the long term.\nIndia recently released a major overhaul of its seismic zonation map under the revised Earthquake Design Code of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), designating the entire Himalayan arc as a newly created highest-risk Zone VI for the first time.\nThe update represents one of the most significant shifts in seismic hazard assessment in decades, with 61 per cent of the country now classified as facing moderate to high earthquake risk.\nContinuous monitoring, improved early warning systems, and better preparedness remain critical for communities living in the shadow of the Himalayas.\nAs Japan braces for its own seismic threat, the Himalayan region watches and waits, knowing that while nature may be buying time, the next great quake could still be on the horizon.\nRecent warnings from Japan about a looming megaquake have reignited concerns about the potential for a catastrophic earthquake in the Himalayan region.\nWhile Japan faces the threat of a massive seismic event due to its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, experts in India are now drawing parallels to the Himalayas, a region that has long been considered a ticking time bomb for a great earthquake.\nWHAT IS THE GREAT HIMALAYAN EARTHQUAKE?\nThe \"Great Himalayan Earthquake\" refers to a hypothetical, massive seismic event that could occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust, a major fault line running beneath the Himalayan mountain range.\nThis region is where the Indian tectonic plate is slowly but relentlessly pushing under the Eurasian plate, building up immense stress over centuries.\nWhen this stress is finally released, it could trigger a quake of magnitude 8 or higher—an event capable of devastating large parts of northern India, Nepal, and neighbouring regions.\nSuch a quake is feared because of the Himalayas' dense population, fragile infrastructure, and the potential for widespread landslides and avalanches.
