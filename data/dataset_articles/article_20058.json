  "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\nStakeholders have raised fresh concerns over the environmental and economic state of the Niger Delta, describing it as the circulatory system of Nigeria’s economy that continues to suffer the harsh effects of degradation, underdevelopment, and marginalisation.\nSpeaking yesterday at the second edition of Road to South-South: The National Convergence of the Renewed Hope Agenda, at the State House Conference Centre, Abuja, Senator Agom Jarigbe, who spoke on behalf of the other stakeholders, said the South-south centrality to Nigeria’s economic survival makes its neglect both untenable and dangerous.\nAccording to him, for decades, the South-south has powered national growth, supplying the oil and gas resources that fuel the federation.\nYet, he lamented, the region’s own “arteries” remain clogged by environmental pollution, economic exclusion, and recurring social unrest.\n“This paradox of contributing massively to national wealth while remaining impoverished at home is the heart of the national question we must resolve,” Jarigbe said.\nHe lauded the Office of the President, particularly the SSA Communications, for convening a shift “from rhetoric to roadmap, from grievance to strategy, and from isolation to collaboration.”\nOn the theme, “Transforming the South-south through Strategic Policy Intervention and Federal Collaboration,” as a national imperative, he outlined three key areas requiring urgent action.\nJarigbe called for a comprehensive Niger Delta Environmental Restoration and Sustainability Act to move beyond “palliative clean-ups” and ensure total remediation of polluted lands and waterways.\nHe stressed the need to hold polluters accountable and establish coordinated environmental monitoring systems.\nThe ranking Senator also emphasised economic diversification through a South-south blueprint that would attract private investment into gas processing, petrochemicals, the blue economy, tourism, and sustainable agriculture.\nHe added that the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Initiative must have a strong implementation footprint in the region to boost industrialisation and job creation.\nAccording to him, collaboration should not be reduced to high-level meetings in Abuja but must translate into integrated action on the ground.\nHe called for infrastructure convergence among the Federal Ministry of Works, NDDC, and state governments to align projects such as the completion of the East-West Road, expansion of seaports in Port Harcourt, Warri, and Calabar, and modernisation of interstate bridges.\n“A coordinated security-development framework, involving the armed forces, police, intelligence agencies, the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, and community groups, to protect critical infrastructure and promote legitimate economic activity.\n“Human capital investment, including Centres of Excellence in energy and environmental studies and improved healthcare and empowerment programmes targeted at oil-bearing communities.\n“Security for pipelines must also mean security for people and their livelihoods,” he explained.\nJarigbe stressed that development must involve the people at every stage and should not be imposed from above.\nHe proposed a compulsory Community Development Agreement (CDA) mechanism for all major projects to guarantee employment, procurement opportunities, and measurable social impact in host communities.\nTraditional rulers and youth groups, he said, must be central to planning, monitoring, and evaluation processes.\nThe lawmaker said transforming the South-south is an overdue moral obligation and a prerequisite for national stability, economic resilience, and environmental justice.\nDescribing the region as “the unfinished business of nation-building,” he urged all stakeholders to commit to actionable outcomes.\n“Let this convergence not be another talk shop,” he warned. “Let it be the launchpad for a new compact between the federal government, the South-South states, the private sector, and the people.”\nJarigbe maintained that the Renewed Hope Agenda offers a new opportunity for collaborative action and insisted that the transformation of the region must begin now, with strategic policy, genuine partnership, and unwavering political will.\nEarlier in her welcome address, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Community Engagement (South-South), Hon. Gift Johnbull, launched Road to South-South 2.0, calling it a renewed push to deepen development and broaden the impact of the Renewed Hope Agenda.\nJohnbull said the initiative builds on the first edition’s successes, emphasizing that “progress must never stall.” The platform bridges government and grassroots communities, ensuring local voices shape national priorities.\nShe highlighted achievements from the inaugural edition, including Project Earn from the Soil, which empowered thousands of farmers with labour-saving machinery recognised by international partners and state governments.\n“Road to South-South 2.0 will focus on agribusiness, renewable energy, education, and technology transfer, turning global training and investment into local impact.”\nJohnbull urged stakeholders to collaborate, stressing that the South-South is not only Nigeria’s oil belt but also its innovation hub, cultural heart, and a vital pillar for national unity and growth.",
