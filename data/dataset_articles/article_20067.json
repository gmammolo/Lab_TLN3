  "text": "Nigeria LNG Limited says persistently high global gas prices are forcing many developing countries to abandon cleaner fuels and revert to coal, undermining global decarbonisation goals and widening the global energy inequality gap.\nAccording to a statement by the company’s General Manager, External Relations & Sustainable Development, Sophia Horsfall, NLNG’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Philip Mshelbila, issued the warning while speaking on the panel, ‘Energy Expansion in a Challenging Global Trade Environment’, at the World LNG Summit & Awards in Istanbul, Turkey.\nMshelbila said the world is entering a period of rising geopolitical tensions, trade fragmentation, and shifting contracting patterns that threaten supply stability, especially for emerging markets already struggling with affordability.\nHe noted that the energy transition will continue to falter unless structural constraints in LNG supply, pricing, financing, and decarbonisation are urgently fixed.",
