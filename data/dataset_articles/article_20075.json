  "text": "Dear Editor,\nI am writing this letter to highlight a problem we the residents of Chesney/Kilcoy are experiencing with the poor quality of water we are getting from the GWI pump at # 4 Dam, Chesney South.\nAfter writing numerous letters to your newspaper highlighting the poor quality of water we were getting from the GWI pump which was located in the Fyrish cemetery, the government listened to our cry and built a mini water treatment plant at # 4 Dam, Chesney South. But lo and behold, since it was commissioned about seven months ago, we continue to receive water with high iron content. If you fill a bottle of water and leave it for twenty four hours you will see about half inch of rust at the bottom of the bottle. I went to the GWI office at Chesney and informed them about the quality of water and the rust content and they promised to flush the lines. I will not deny they flushed the lines, because I do not know, but if they did, there is no improvement in the quality of water.\nOn behalf of the residents of Chesney/Kilcoy, I am appealing to the CEO of GWI, Mr. Shaik Baksh to look into this matter and get the experts to rectify this problem. After all, a water treatment plant should give us pure, treated water. Hoping for a speedy response.\nYours faithfully,\nImtiaz Baccus",
