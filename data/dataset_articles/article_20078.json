  "text": "Heavy rainfall across the region has heightened concerns about potential record-breaking flood levels in the Skagit River, leading local authorities to issue evacuation orders for several communities.\nAs of Wednesday evening, a flood warning is active for the Skagit River near Mount Vernon and Concrete, as well as for parts of Whatcom County, including Everson and Sumas adjacent to the Nooksack River. Currently, the Skagit River is experiencing moderate flooding, while the Nooksack River is at minor flood stage.\nForecasts predict that the Skagit River at Concrete could crest at 48 feet around 4 a.m. Thursday, marking an unprecedented high level. In Mount Vernon, the river is expected to peak at 42 feet by 4 a.m. Friday. The Nooksack River is anticipated to reach a crest of 150 feet by 10 p.m. Wednesday, with further peaks in Ferndale estimated at 22 feet Thursday afternoon.\nResidents in Mount Vernon and neighboring upland communities—Hamilton, Rockport, Marblemount, and Concrete—have been urged to evacuate to higher ground immediately. Those living in 100-year floodplain areas should be prepared to leave within the next 24 hours.\nIn Whatcom County, additional flood indicators are concerning. The South Fork Nooksack River at Saxon Bridge was last recorded at 6.49 feet but is expected to exceed 10.81 feet, which constitutes major flooding. Similarly, the Nooksack River at North Cedarville is projected to peak at 150.08 feet, a significant rise from current levels.\nWith rain expected to persist overnight across Bellingham and Mount Vernon, forecasts suggest that an inch of additional rainfall is possible. Evacuation protocols remain a priority, as residents are reminded to heed warnings and leave their homes as necessary.\nAs the situation escalates, the National Guard has mobilized 100 troops in the Marysville area, with an additional 200 troops expected to be deployed in the coming days to assist in emergency responses across Snohomish, Skagit, and Whatcom counties.\nWashington Governor Bob Ferguson addressed the situation during a CNN interview, noting the unprecedented risks posed by the rising waters. He has requested an emergency declaration from the federal government to allocate additional resources for emergency response efforts. This includes deploying helicopters and personnel to rescue stranded residents.\nMount Vernon Fire Chief Bryan Harris reported that all individuals residing in the floodplain, approximately 75,000 people, have been instructed to evacuate. He emphasized that local shelters may not be sufficient to accommodate everyone and urged residents to seek refuge with friends or family where possible.\nAs communities brace for worsening conditions, emergency shelters are being established in coordination with the American Red Cross. Harris mentioned plans for door-to-door notifications in affected neighborhoods to ensure that residents are aware of the dangers.\nOfficials continue to monitor water levels closely, with dikes and levies under scrutiny, especially as the flood watch is in effect until at least Saturday morning. Residents are encouraged to stay informed and avoid unnecessary travel during this critical time.\nIn the meantime, several recreational areas and essential services have been closed, including local parks, schools, and court services, as authorities prioritize safety and accessibility for emergency management. Residents are advised to remain vigilant and adhere to evacuation orders to minimize risks as flooding threatens multiple communities throughout the region.",
