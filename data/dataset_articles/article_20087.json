  "text": "IndiaPosted at: Dec 11 2025 10:40AM MP moves adjournment motion in LS over Delhi Pollution ‘Emergency’New Delhi, Dec. 11 (UNI) Congress MP Vijayakumar alias Vijay Vasanth has submitted an adjournment motion in the lower house of Parliament seeking suspension of all business to discuss what he termed as a “relentless and unprecedented public health emergency” caused by air pollution in Delhi-NCR region.AQI levels in Delhi had touched 399 briefly at noon on Wednesday, according to the real-time monitoring portal AQI.in, placing the city on the brink of the ‘severe’ category once again. In his notice to the Speaker, the MP said Delhi had reached a point where “breathing has become a daily gamble,” with children growing up on inhalers and outdoor work turning into a health risk. He accused the government of responding with “rhetoric, committee meetings and cosmetic measures” instead of decisive action.Arguing that global models such as that adopted by Beijing, have shown that severe air pollution can be reversed.The MO wants the Central government to adopt “proven strategies” such as rapid electrification of public transport, strict vehicular controls, mandatory pollution-control retrofits in coal plants, relocation of heavy industry, and transparent air-quality data systems.While Beijing acted with “discipline and urgency,” the MP claimed, Delhi continues to suffer because of “persistent inertia.” The Speaker is yet to decide on admitting the motion.
