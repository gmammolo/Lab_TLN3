  "text": "Jefferson County is working to determine the cost of operations at the Circular Butte Landfill following the recent loss of business from Madison County now that the neighboring county has it’s own landfill facility. This consideration comes as Jefferson County works to update the facility’s fee schedule.\nAccording to Brandy Ward with Jefferson County Solid Waste, Circular Butte has just completed their first month without their big haulers from Madison County. As expected, the tonnage and the revenue to the Terreton facility has dropped compared to previous months and years. However, despite this decline, Ward announced that there was a slight increase in dumps from Madison, Fremont and Bingham commercial haulers. These haulers continue to pay the out-of-county rate to dump at the Circular Butte.\nAccording to discussion with the board, Ward has been asked to create comparison of operation costs now, with the loss of their big haulers to help them determine how much should be charged, per haul, to keep the facility operating.\nWard stated all regular operations such as digging or compacting are still taking place. While they have marginally cut back on the compactor usage, they still are in need of operators to run the machine and to continue digging. County Commissioner Roger Clark expressed a concern over how much was really needed with the approximate 4,500 loss in tonnage, indicating the last month showed they had gone from taking in 7 thousand tons to only 2,500.\n“It takes so many people to run the landfill,” Ward stated, “regardless of how much garbage we’re getting.”\nCounty commissioner Scott Hancock indicated the county has known this loss would occur for some time and further stated that they focused on replacing and upgrading their current equipment while they had the funds to do so.\nThey would like to eventually ensure they’re running both the Circular Butte and County Line Landfill facilities as cost effectively as possible, Hancock indicated, ensuring they aren’t overstaffed for what they are receiving; these considerations would likely need to be reviewed at the county’s next budgeting season.\nIn other business at the same meeting, Ward addressed the board regarding garbage pick-ups in the county right-of-ways that her staff have been dealing with.\nThere have been some instances of county citizens calling the landfill and reporting that someone has dumped tires, refrigerators, or other waste items in the county right-of-ways. She stated that she had advised callers to contact the sheriff’s office since littering is against the law, however, she said callers only reached back out to her claiming there was nothing the sheriff’s office could do.\nWard informed the board that she had then sent some of her own employees down to collect the items and haul them back to the landfill, but wasn’t certain this was truly cost effective for the county. According to Hancock, this was likely the best way to handle the situation.\nHancock indicated it was important to maintain the cleanliness of the county and encouraged Ward to enlist the help of the county’s Road and Bridge Department to remove these types of items. However, Road and Bridge Supervisor Mike Carter further expressed he would not want to encourage county citizens to continue this behavior. The commissioners agreed and stated they would like to prosecute perpetrators when at all possible.",
