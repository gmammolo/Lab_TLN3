  "text": "Parkland housing plan 'threatens albino badgers' Marcus White - South of England Thu, December 11, 2025 at 6:17 a.m. UTC 3 min read\nA plan to build more than 80 designer homes in the grounds of a fire-hit mansion would destroy an \"irreplaceable natural habitat\", a campaign group has said.\nFormer rave promoter James Perkins has applied to build a \"parkland\" housing estate at Grade I listed Parnham House, which was partially destroyed by fire in 2017.\nDorset Natural Heritage Initiative (DNHI) said the plans lacked a \"robust ecological survey\", obscured the presence of otters, and threatened a population of rare albino badgers.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A Parnham Park spokesman said there was no evidence to support the group's claims.\nThe fire broke out in the early hours of 15 April 2017 and took four days to fully extinguish.\nPrevious owner Michael Treichl was arrested on suspicion of arson and was found dead two months later.\nParnham Park said the housing development would pay for restoration work, including rebuilding a roof and filling a wall gap with \"showpiece\" glazing.\nDNHI, which was formed to oppose the development, said Parnham's deer park, Millground meadow and a section of the River Brit were all under threat of destruction.\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It said the estate's application contained no otter survey, on the assumption that there was no local population, even though Parnham's website encourages visitors to \"spot otter trails\".\nThe meadow's albino badgers were also ignored in the documents, the group said.\nProtected trees and valuable lichen were threatened in the Grade II listed deer park, it added.\nIn a statement, DNHI said: \"Parnham's entire approach towards this development... prioritises the partial restoration of a private estate over and above the wishes of the local community, destroying an irreplaceable natural habitat in the process.\"\nFormer rave promoter James Perkins bought the stately home in 2020 [Parnham Estate] Parnham project manager Ed Grant said its ecological assessment was \"thorough\" and \"robust\".\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He said: \"We do indeed talk about otters on our website, and this is because there is evidence at the other end of the estate by Parnham Lake.\n\"The area the application refers to is much too shallow for otters to establish themselves.\n\"There is also no evidence of badgers within 30m of the proposals.\n\"As ever, we remain focused on saving this incredibly important John Nash Grade I listed building.\"\nTrees have grown through the mansion's collapsed roof and walls [Parnham Estate] The planning application proposes 82 new homes and two guest lodges, as well as the restoration of the stately home's south wing \"as a private home with a hospitality offering\".\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Home owners would have the use of an outdoor natural swimming pool, a gym, a padel court and electric vehicle charging facilities for each house.\nThe housing is proposed as an \"enabling development\" - one that would not normally be allowed but for the conservation benefit to Parnham House.\nDorset Council is inviting comments on the new plans until 28 December.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook , X , or Instagram .\nMore on this story Related link Dorset Council\nAdvertisement About Our Ads",
