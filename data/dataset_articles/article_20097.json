  "text": "Roads and Highways dept fined Tk1.32cr for illegal hill cutting in Ctg\nApproximately 132,570 cubic feet of hill, equivalent to about 34.92 decimals, had been cut\nThe Department of Environment (DoE) has slapped a fine of Tk1.32 crore on the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) for illegally cutting hills without securing a mandatory environmental clearance certificate in Chattogram.\nThe hefty penalty was imposed on yesterday (10 December) following a final hearing at the DoE's Chattogram regional office concerning the Widening of Baraiyerhat–Heanko–Ramgarh Road Project (LOC-III).\nThe DoE's enforcement action originated from an initial inspection on 19 December 2024, after the RHD sought a location clearance for the project. During that visit, officials had discovered some evidence of unauthorised hill cutting and earth removal.\nA formal enforcement hearing was held on 23 September this year, after which the DoE ordered a reinvestigation to precisely measure the extent of the damage.\nA fresh inspection conducted on 4 November 2025, in the presence of project officials, determined that approximately 132,570 cubic feet of hil, equivalent to about 34.92 decimals, had been cut, said Senior Chemist Golam Bashir Ahmed of the DoE Chattogram regional office.\nThe DoE subsequently summoned all responsible parties for the final hearing yesterday. Those present included RHD Project Director and Supervising Engineer Mohammad Zahed Hossain, Executive Engineer Mohammad Moslehuddin Chowdhury, Ashoka Buildcon Managing Director Sandwip Dey, and representatives of the contractor.\nAfter reviewing the reinvestigation report, the DoE imposed a compensation fine of Tk1,32,57,000 under Section 7 of the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 (amended 2010) for the unauthorised hill cutting carried out under the road widening project.\nHowever, RHD's Zahed Hossain contested the decision, arguing that the hill cutting was necessary to build a bridge for the public interest. He claimed that the DoE's calculated figures were higher than the actual amount of earth removed and stated that the Roads and Highways Department would take further steps regarding the issue.",
