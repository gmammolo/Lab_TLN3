  "text": "New Report Warns of Rising Deforestation Risks in Indonesia's Pulp Supply Chain\nReporter\nDecember 11, 2025 | 12:01 pm\nTEMPO.CO, Jakarta - New findings from Trase.Earth show that while deforestation linked to Indonesia’s pulp industry declined in 2024, the overall risk of natural forest destruction is still alarmingly high.\nTrase’s latest supply chain analysis reveals that most forest loss is occurring in Industrial Timber Plantation (HTI) concessions that do not supply wood to major mills. Because these concessions fall outside corporate sustainability commitments, their activities often escape monitoring and public accountability.\nTrase Data Scientist Adelina Chandra said more than 80 percent of deforestation recorded since 2015 occurred in these non-supplier concessions, highlighting a major gap in oversight.\nKalimantan Emerges as a Deforestation Hotspot\nThe research shows that recent forest clearing is concentrated in West, Central, and East Kalimantan, including concessions that have opened thousands of hectares of natural forests and wildlife habitats.\nThis risk is expected to intensify with the operation of new pulp mills in North Kalimantan, which may begin sourcing wood from areas that still contain high-value natural forests.\n“Although deforestation in timber plantations has been trending downward, the surge in the early 2000s and existing gaps in sustainability commitments have left lasting damage on Indonesia’s natural forests,” Adelina said at a briefing in Jakarta on Wednesday, December 10, 2025.\nSumatra’s Long-Term Forest Loss Fuels Disaster Risks\nBeyond Kalimantan, Sumatra has experienced extensive forest loss over many years without adequate recovery. Adelina said the severe flash floods that struck Sumatra this year reflect the cumulative impact of long-term environmental degradation.\nShe added that the pressures on Indonesia’s landscapes extend beyond tree loss. Nearly 43 percent of productive timber plantation areas sit on drained peatlands, which emit significant greenhouse gases and heighten the risk of fires.\nIn 2024, emissions from peat subsidence reached 76 million tons of COe, making the pulp sector a major contributor to land-use emissions.\nSocial conflicts, including land disputes, intimidation, and the criminalization of Indigenous and local communities, also persist.\nCalls for Stronger Oversight and Full NDPE Compliance\nAdelina emphasized that protecting Indonesia’s forests requires stronger commitments and stricter oversight, supported by transparent supply chains.\nWhile the pulp sector has made progress, she said deeper and more consistent implementation of No Deforestation, No Peat, and No Exploitation (NDPE) standards is essential.\n“Open data is critical for identifying where risks are concentrated, spotting new threats, and tracking progress,” she said.\nEnvironmental Groups Warn of Policy Gaps\nEnvironmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara echoed Trase’s concerns, stressing the need for the government and industry to close policy loopholes that still allow forest clearing outside formal supervision.\nCampaigner Hilman Afif said licensed concessions that remain free to clear natural forests, including those in high conservation value areas, undermine NDPE commitments.\n“The government and companies must take firmer action to protect remaining forests, restore peatlands, and uphold community rights,” Hilman said.\nHe added that Trase and Auriga Nusantara are calling for immediate steps to expand NDPE obligations to all timber plantation concessions, strengthen monitoring in vulnerable regions, and ensure new mills do not trigger fresh deforestation.\n“The sustainability of Indonesia’s pulp sector is only possible if practices that cause forest loss are halted now,” he said.\nRead: Police Install Starlink to Restore Internet in Flood-Hit Aceh\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",
