  "text": "The Amazon rainforest, Earth’s largest tropical forest, is undergoing some major changes. The researchers warn that new extreme conditions could threaten trees and biodiversity. Climate change is driving this shift toward a rare hypertropical climate. Rainforest Enters Extreme Climate Zone The Amazon is moving toward a hypertropical climate rapidly and unusually. Hot droughts may become longer, more frequent, and severely damaging. By year 2100, some regions could face 150 drought days yearly. This threatens trees and the overall rainforest ecosystem dramatically. Climate Shifts Threaten Amazon Trees Researchers analysed 30 years of temperature, humidity, soil and sunlight. Tree sap flow was monitored to detect stress from water loss. Prolonged low soil moisture caused embolisms, cutting off tree water. Trees close pores during droughts, limiting photosynthesis and carbon intake. Some Vulnerable Trees Identified Fast-growing trees suffer most under hot, dry conditions in forests. Slow-growing, dense-wood trees may survive, but overall forest will change. Tree mortality, currently around 1%, could rise to 1.55% annually. Forest composition may shift drastically, affecting biodiversity and carbon storage. Carbon Storage At Risk Loss of trees reduces the Amazon’s ability to store carbon effectively. Massive die-offs could release large amounts of stored carbon into atmosphere. This would worsen global warming and climate instability worldwide. Maintaining forest integrity is critical for planetary climate regulation. Global Implications on the Rainforest Similar hypertropical transitions could affect Africa and Southeast Asia. The greenhouse-gas emissions will accelerate extreme climate shifts globally. If unchecked, rainforests may convert into savannas or degraded woodlands. Biodiversity, ecosystem services and human livelihoods are all at risk. Urgent Conservation Measures Protecting the Amazon remains critical to slowing ecological collapse. Forest monitoring helps scientists predict droughts and tree mortality accurately. Immediate climate action and sustainable policies are essential for survival. Preserving tropical forests safeguards biodiversity and helps stabilise Earth’s climate.\",",
