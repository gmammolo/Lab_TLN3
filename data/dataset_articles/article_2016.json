  "text": "Crime & Safety\nTuscaloosa-Area Police Warn Against Vigilante Social Media Trend\nHere's what the heads of local law enforcement agencies had to say about a dangerous new social media trend.\nTUSCALOOSA, AL — Officials from Tuscaloosa area law enforcement agencies gathered Wednesday to caution the public against an emerging social media trend where private citizens pose as a minors online to lure suspected child sex predators and confront them on social media.\nClick here to subscribe to our free daily newsletter and breaking news alerts.\nTuscaloosa County Sheriff Ron Abernathy, District Attorney Hays Webb, Tuscaloosa Police Chief Brent Blankley, University of Alabama Police Chief Josh Hooks and Northport Police Chief Gerald Burton were all in attendance for the press conference at the sheriff's office.\nFind out what's happening in Tuscaloosafor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nAbernathy said his office wants to stress the importance of the threats to public safety as the vigilante videos continue to spur copy-cats online. He said this can endanger public safety while also hindering the ability of investigators to effectively work these cases.\nClick the video link below to watch today's full press conference or click here to watch it on our YouTube channel.\nFind out what's happening in Tuscaloosafor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nCaptain Phil Simpson, commander of the West Alabama Human Trafficking Task Force, also addressed a recent incident that prompted the press conference while also taking questions from the media.\nWhile Simpson said he could not elaborate on any details of the recent incident or another he mentioned that occurred a couple of years ago\nMost importantly, though, Simpson echoed Abernathy when pointing out the dangers to both the investigation and the vigilante.\n\"This is disturbing because this is something that is very prominent on social media,\" Simpson said. \"Many of these videos result in people being assaulted, people who may or may not be a criminal being very seriously assaulted. If you look at some of these videos some of these assaults rise to the level of a felony. ... You may run into somebody that's gonna lay the beating on you instead of you laying the beating on them.\"\nSimpson also said many offenders the task force interact with may also be armed, which raises the stakes even more as it relates to public safety.\n\"This raises the danger level to people who are trying to do something good in the wrong way but also to members of the general public because quite often the people who are doing these basically vigilante operations are doing them in public places,\" he said.\nSimpson went on to say those found participating in this social media trend could also faces charges up to and including false imprisonment — something he said could turn the vigilante into a suspect in their own criminal investigation.\n\"We have seen cases where there was a mistaken identity and the wrong person was attacked and accosted,\" he said. \"We are trying to protect the public and, more importantly, we're trying to protect the children.\"\nHave a news tip or suggestion on how I can improve Tuscaloosa Patch?
