  "text": "Police Say Tyreek Hill Involved in Domestic Dispute With Wife on Monday\nMiami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife Monday afternoon, police said in an incident report obtained by WPLG-TV in Miami Wednesday.\nAccording to the report, police were summoned to Hill's condominium in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla.—with the caller describing \"assault in progress.\"\nAlesia Vaccaro—the mother of Hill's wife, Keeta Hill—described the wide receiver as \"very aggressive and impulsive.\" Per the report, Vaccaro called the police \"after claiming that she witnessed Tyreek... throw a laptop on the floor, then grab his daughter and begin walking toward the balcony of their residence.\"\nKeeta characterized Tyreek's claimed grabbing of their daughter as a non-malicious response to an argument, but told police she intended to file for divorce.\nNo arrests were made due to the incident. Tyreek, 31, previously pled guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation of a different woman in 2015.\nRegarded of one of the most effective wide receivers of his generation, Tyreek has made eight Pro Bowls and five All-Pro teams in his nine-year career.",
