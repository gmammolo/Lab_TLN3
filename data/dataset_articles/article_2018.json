(KOLN) - The man found guilty in a drive-by shooting that damaged a north Lincoln home in 2023 is appealing his sentence.\nThe defense attorney for 25-year-old Talon Dennis filed an appeal in Lancaster County District Court on April 3, court documents show. He was sentenced just a day prior to 15-20 years in prison for attempted possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, a Class 2 Felony. He was given credit for 219 days served.\nDennis took a plea deal in February, pleading no contest to the charge. In exchange, prosecutors dropped one count of unlawfully and intentionally discharging a firearm and one count of use firearm to commit a felony.\nThe Lincoln Police Department Gang Unit and Fugitive Task Force arrested Dennis on Oct. 31, 2023, following an investigation into a drive-by shooting near 24th and Holdrege streets. A bullet traveled inside the home with four people sleeping inside and struck the drywall in the living area, according to police. No injuries were reported.\nPolice located a single 9mm casing was located near the intersection of 24th and Holdrege streets.\nDuring the investigation, officers learned that Dennis was openly talking about being on the run from law enforcement due to shooting up his ex-girlfriend’s house, court documents show. The reporting party claimed Dennis had a black handgun on his person during the interaction.\nDocuments show Dennis is a convicted felon and is prohibited from possessing a firearm.\nDennis was later arrested and lodged in the Lancaster County Jail.\nCopyright 2023 KOLN.
