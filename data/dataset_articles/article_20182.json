A break in that 12-inch pipe at the Buttonwoods end over the summer focused attention on the city’s aging water infrastructure – and in this case, the need to replace the cast-iron pipe that city records indicate may have been installed in 1929.\nThe fact that the pipe has lasted this long amazes Gerald Ouillette, chief of the city’s Water Division. But replacing it is not a matter of rolling out a backhoe, digging a trench and dropping in an “HDPE” or High-Density Polyethylene pipe. The existing line stretches from Buttonwoods Point beneath Brushneck Cove to Strand Avenue in Oakland Beach. The replacement pipe would parallel it.\nTo install the new line and ensure water pressure for firefighters not to overlook thousands of residents and scores of businesses, the plan is to directionally drill a route for the pipe under the cove. That’s what the engineering firm Stantec was looking at when it made three 50-foot cove test borings last summer. What they found, Ouillette says, are “boiling sands,” a term used to describe earthen conditions so fluid that a drill can’t find purchase to create a passageway for a pipe. The solution is to go deeper. More test borings – now at 85 feet – are planned for this month.\nThe entire process struck a nerve with Ward 5 Councilman Ed Ladouceur, chair of the council’s finance committee, at the Dec. 1 meeting. He questioned why the city should be paying Santec an additional $31,000 when the council approved $199,500 on Nov. 3 for the engineer services for the replacement of the pipe. Why are they now planning to do a second set of borings at a deeper level when according to Ladouceur’s calculations, they suspected boiling sands in August? Why hadn’t they gone deeper the first time around? Ouillette’s answer is that the geological studies indicating the possibility of boiling sands was not completed in time for the first set of borings. From Ladouceur’s perspective, the city should have stayed on top of what was being undertaken and now is being told to pay for something that needs to be repeated. He wanted to table action on the $31,000 and have Santec give its explanation to the council. However, the council went ahead and approved the payment.\nThe $31,000 is but a few crumbs off the cost of the full project.\nOuillette shrugs when asked the projected cost of replacing the pipe. He notes that following the engineering of the project, the division will need to advertise for bids and choose a contractor.\nDoes the division have sufficient funds in maintenance and replacement account? Ouillette didn’t disclose what’s in that account, but said the division would likely seek grants from the state Infrastructure Bank to pay for the work.\nAnd, why is the Brushneck Cove pipe necessary if Oakland Beach and Buttonwoods are supplied by other pipes?\nThat answer, explained Ouillette, is that it completes a loop, ensuring supply if there is a break in the system, pressure and movement of water that enhances clarity and meets standards.\nNo comments on this item\nPlease log in to comment by clicking here",
