The demonstration, which had been ongoing for the past 15 months, suddenly turned violent after a Mahapanchayat (grand meeting).\nThousands of protesters broke through barricades, entered the factory premises, and demolished walls. Several areas were vandalised, and around 14 vehicles were set on fire.\nPolice tried to control the crowd by firing tear gas shells and using mild force, but protesters responded by throwing bricks and stones.\nNearly three dozen people were injured, including 24 police officers and approximately 12 protesters. Three policemen were reported in critical condition.\nDespite police intervention, the crowd became increasingly aggressive. MLA Abhimanyu Poonia sustained head injuries during the clashes and was admitted to the Government District Hospital in Hanumangarh. Large numbers of protesters remained inside and outside the factory premises until late evening, keeping the situation tense.\nDuring the Mahapanchayat held outside the SDM office on Wednesday morning, farmer organisations, village women, youth, and farmer unions participated in large numbers.\nFarmer leaders demanded an immediate halt to construction work and insisted that the plant should not proceed until a formal agreement was reached with the farmers. They warned that if no response was received by 2 p.m., they would march to the factory.\nWhen the administration failed to provide any written assurance, the crowd broke through barricades and entered the factory premises. Inside the factory, protesters demolished walls with tractors, set office structures and piles of machinery on fire, and vandalised vehicles parked outside. Stones were thrown at police deployed in the security cordon.\nDespite repeated warnings, the protesters did not retreat, forcing police to fire tear gas shells. Throughout the day, the injured were brought to the town's community health centre. Among the 36 people injured, 24 were police officers, and 12 were protesters.\nSeveral policemen suffered serious head and shoulder injuries. MLA Abhimanyu Poonia was referred to Hanumangarh for further treatment. Due to the risk of further violence, internet services were shut down from Tuesday night. A heavy police presence has been maintained since Wednesday morning, and the local market has remained closed.\nFarmers' organisations from Punjab and Haryana also arrived in large numbers, significantly increasing the crowd. Additional police forces were called from nearby districts to help control the situation.\nThousands of farmers remained gathered inside and outside the factory premises late into Wednesday night.\nTension continued in the area on Thursday, and the administration has appealed to the public to maintain peace.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
