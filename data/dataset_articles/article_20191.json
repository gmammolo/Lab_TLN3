  "text": "Snoqualmie Valley communities brace for more impacts as river keeps rising Wednesday night\nWASHINGTON STATE — The Snoqualmie River continues to rise, sending rushing water through several communities across the Snoqualmie Valley region.\nFlooding is causing road closures and evacuations for some residents. Meanwhile, Snoqualmie Falls is expected to reach a record depth of 19 feet late Wednesday night, according to the National Weather Service.\nRELATED: Evacuations underway as western Washington faces catastrophic flood warnings\nJohn Duffy and his son were seen wading through the City of Snoqualmie's flooded streets on Wednesday afternoon.\n\"On my earlier walk, within 10 minutes, it [Snoqualmie River] rose about six inches,\" Duffy told KOMO News.\nHis family has lived in Snoqualmie since 2012, therefore experiencing major flood events before, but Duffy said this week has already been worse than past floods.\n\"Just up the block on River Street, you can see the river's up to the actual street, and it's kind of flowing down,\" Duffy retold. \"You see lots of huge trees going down the river.\"\nFurther downstream, but still along the Snoqualmie River, flooding in North Bend is no surprise to Jerry Houser and his family.\nALSO SEE: Drivers in Carnation navigate roadblocks amid county flood concerns\n“They’ve been here since 1964,\" Houser said about his parents. \"So, this happens every 10 years or so.”\nHouser was checking on his parents' house, also his childhood home, as water crept higher on Wednesday afternoon. The Houser family's green home was just one of many houses along the river that were seemingly already underwater. But Houser displayed little concern.\n“The homes are up higher,\" he explained. \"You can see the porch there; it would have to get that high to get into the house.\"\nStill, Houser knows that the rising river isn't the only thing that poses a threat to his parents' home. He told KOMO News that his biggest concern is a log jam.\nRELATED: Ferguson declares state of emergency in response to flooding, activates National Guard\n\"When they clear upstream, they’ll come down, hit a tree, and it just pushes the whole current towards the homes instead of staying out in the river,\" he said.\nFor now, Houser said he's keeping a close eye on the overflowing Snoqualmie River and hoping for a break from the downpour.\n“If it stays like this, everybody’s fine,\" he continued, \"just a mess to clean up afterwards.”",
