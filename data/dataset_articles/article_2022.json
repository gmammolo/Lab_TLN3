  "text": "Frisco is still reeling from the loss of 17-year-old Austin Metcalf, a standout football player at Frisco Memorial High School, who died last week following a tragic stabbing during a high school track and field championship. A day meant for athletic achievement turned into one filled with heartbreak and disbelief. Metcalf’s death has shaken the local community, with students, parents, and teachers searching for answers and peace in the aftermath. His twin brother, Hunter, was reportedly present during the incident and tried to save him at the scene. Now, the focus shifts to remembering Austin not for how he died but for how he lived. The Metcalf family has announced that Austin’s memorial service will take place on Saturday at Hope Fellowship Frisco East. A private burial will follow immediately after the service. The family is encouraging those who want to honor Austin’s legacy to consider donating to a scholarship fund in his name. Karmelo Anthony is 17 years old and attends Centennial High School. He faces a first-degree murder charge for the stabbing. Authorities arrested him shortly after the incident and are currently holding him on $1 million bail. His attorneys released a public statement on Monday expressing condolences and urging the public not to rush to judgment. According to ABC , the attorneys said, “Karmelo and the entire Anthony family are sincerely saddened that a life was lost and offer their condolences to the family of Austin Metcalf. Karmelo… is entitled to a fair and impartial legal process.” In the face of unimaginable loss, Austin’s father has called for compassion, even for the teen accused of killing his son. “It’s very unfortunate that this other child decided to make a bad choice that’s going to affect him for the rest of his life,” he told reporters. “I want to make this very clear, this is not a race issue. This is not a black and white issue.” As the legal process unfolds, the Frisco community grieves, remembering Austin for the person he was on and off the field.
