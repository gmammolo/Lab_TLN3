  "text": "An average of €1.3million worth of wind energy has been wasted every day since the start of 2025, politicians have been told.\nBillions of euro worth of renewable energy has been unused in recent years because producers are instructed by Eirgrid to switch off production, an Oireachtas committee heard yesterday.\nThe guidance to ‘dispatch down’ means wind farms must switch off when levels are higher than the grid can handle. That means energy that could be made with the available infrastructure is never produced but must still be paid for by the Government.\nThis has prompted calls for the State to explore providing free energy – or a ‘social tariff’ – to families in energy poverty at certain times of the day to cut down on waste.\nThe squandered energy could be used with no extra cost to the Government because ‘we’ve paid for it already’, according to one expert.\nSome 1,169 gigawatts of energy went unused in the ten months to October 31, worth a total of €414million, according to analysis of data from Eirgrid, the body responsible for managing the electricity grid.\nThat amount would be enough to heat 390million tanks of hot water, according to the not-for-profit group EnergyCloud, which advocates for proper use of surplus renewable energy.\nEnergyCloud CEO Alan Wyley told the Oireachtas Energy Committee yesterday that instead of wasting the energy, consumers should be able to use it for free because the Government pays to buy the wind power anyway.\n‘Why don’t we have a social tariff?’ he said. ‘At times of waste in the system, we can say between 11pm and 8am, if you use your electricity, the tariff is zero. You can do that nationally or you can do it regionally based on constraints.’\nHe said he could be ‘certain’ the electricity grid was able to handle the extra load because most of the wasted wind energy was lost between 11pm and 8am.\nSome €2.5billion worth of wind energy has already been wasted since 2017. The annual figure rose from €50million in 2017 to €450million last year and Mr Wyley said the Government expected the full figure for 2025 to be around €600million.\nMr Wyley told Extra.ie last night that the country could waste ‘way over’ €3billion in wind energy during the lifetime of this Government. He added that if the grid could handle peak demand, it should be able to manage extra usage overnight.\nThe Government is required to pay for energy produced by its wind sources but sometimes orders these sites to ‘dispatch down’ the power being made.\nThe Wind Energy Ireland website states: ‘If a wind farm receives this instruction… all or some of the turbines need to be turned out of the wind or shut down.’\nThis may be because of constraints in the system, where available power lines cannot transport enough electricity, or because of the difficulty in managing inconsistent levels of renewable power coming into the grid.\nHowever, Mr Wyley said most wind power was dispatched down, or wasted, at night. He said all of this was ‘renewable, clean energy’ which could be used to decarbonise the grid and help with energy poverty.\n‘There really isn’t a good reason that we’re aware of not to do this other than the status quo. It’s undeniable that the Government has so far done nothing on this issue,’ he remarked.\nHe said around 11% of wind energy is wasted in total, compared to about 5% of solar energy.\nEnergyCloud had seen ‘very good engagement’ from politicians on the issue, but Mr Wyley said it is now ‘time for action’. He told the committee: ‘All it requires is a little bit of leadership to say we would like to use the levers of Government.’\nThe wasted energy was ‘such a missed opportunity’ because it could be used’ with no extra cost to the Government because ‘we’ve paid for it already’, according to Mr Wyley.\nCathal Lee, EnergyCloud’s co-founder, told the committee it was a ‘moral question’ why people ‘look away’ from such large energy waste. He added: ‘There’s no one entity responsible for using this waste and therefore it doesn’t get measured and it doesn’t get addressed.’\nMr Lee said there was ‘no joined-up approach’ to tackling the issue and that various departments had been reluctant to take responsibility for the waste. ‘You guys as legislators, this is in your gift to say who is ultimately responsible for this waste,’ he told the committee.\nAn Energy Affordability Taskforce has been introduced by the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment to investigate the drivers of energy costs and recommend structural changes. But it is not due to report back until July and Mr Wyley said EnergyCloud’s recommendations could be carried out in parallel with the taskforce’s investigation.\n‘We welcome the taskforce but we don’t think we should wait until the publication of its report to do anything,’ he said.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment said it acknowledged the pressure of high energy costs on households, adding that affordability was a ‘priority’.\nThey said the Government was committed to a ‘renewables-led energy system, supported by strong investment in the electricity network’.\nAn Eirgrid document states on the issue of waste: ‘There are times when not all energy from wind generators can be used. For example, if there is too much renewable energy, then this could cause instability to the system. Alternatively, in some locations there may not be enough capacity in the transmission circuits to safely carry the power from a group of wind farms.\n‘In these cases, Eirgrid and SONI [the operator in the North] may have to instruct the wind farms to generate less than they could.’",
