  "text": "Pune, December 11, 2025 — Raising strong concerns over Pune’s escalating drinking water crisis, Congress MLC and former minister Satej Patil on Wednesday demanded that the Maharashtra government immediately halt approvals for new residential projects in the city until a reliable water supply is ensured for existing residents.\nSpeaking in the State Legislative Council, Patil criticised the government for allowing rapid urban expansion despite the widening gap in drinking water availability. “Pune’s water situation is deteriorating every day. When the government cannot guarantee drinking water to citizens, how can it justify permitting new constructions? This only adds to the hardship of residents,” he said.\nPatil pointed out that Pune’s current population stands at around 70 lakh, with an additional floating population of 5–7 lakh. He warned that the number could reach one crore by 2027, while infrastructure remains severely strained. “The PMC cannot cope with the growing demand. Construction continues unchecked, but essential services are failing,” he added.\nहिवाळी अधिवेशन, नागपूर : 2025\nपुणे शहराच्या पाणीप्रश्नावर मुख्यमंत्र्याबरोबर लवकरच बैठक!\nआज पुणे शहराच्या पाणीपुरवठा संदर्भातील लक्षवेधी सुरु असलेल्या प्रश्नामध्ये सहभागी होऊन पुणेकरांच्या अडचणी मांडल्या.\nपुणे शहराचा विस्तार वाढत असताना महानगरपालिकेने सन 2025- 26 साठी 16.32… pic.twitter.com/iIZJvqKsiT\n— Satej (Bunty) D. Patil (@satejp) December 9, 2025 He further highlighted the increasing dependence on private tankers and the growing influence of the tanker mafia. “Nearly one lakh tankers operate in Pune. This dependency is dangerous, and if the situation continues, disputes over water may arise in the future,” Patil cautioned.\nThe Congress leader also noted that while water allocation for Pune was set at 14 TMC in 2014 based on projections for 2031, the current requirement has risen to 22 TMC, far exceeding the city’s allocated share.\nPatil urged Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to convene a high-level meeting immediately to address the crisis. “The situation is spiralling. Without an urgent action plan led by the chief minister, the problem will only worsen,” he said.\nResponding to the concerns, Water Resources Minister Radhakrishna Patil maintained that Pune’s current allocation of 14–15 TMC is adequate and that PMC’s request for more water lacked proper justification. However, he acknowledged the growing issue of the tanker mafia. He assured the House that after the legislative session, a meeting chaired by the chief minister would be held to find a solution.\nThe debate underscored the mounting challenges faced by Pune as its population expands faster than its water infrastructure can support.",
