  "text": "Homes and other structures have reportedly been destroyed due to an aggressive bushfire in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales. The fire, which reached emergency level north of Lithgow on Tuesday afternoon, has prompted building impact assessment teams to investigate the extent of the damage.\nThe Home Hills Road fire, located at Bogee in the Capertee Valley, has since been downgraded to an advice level following a change in wind direction. Kennedy Porter, a spokesperson for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) Cudgegong district, indicated that an unspecified number of properties, including several unoccupied holiday homes, have been lost to the flames. “We are yet to confirm exact details… until we get some boots on the ground to identify exactly what the losses are,” Porter stated. She emphasized that the primary focus is property protection and that assessments will commence once conditions are deemed safe.\nGround crews face obstacles as bulldozers work to clear fallen trees obstructing access routes. Aerial firefighting teams have been engaged in water-bombing efforts within the fire zone, while firefighters worked throughout the night to safeguard at least a dozen homes under challenging conditions described as “erratic.” “The fire activity was still really significant overnight, and the crews were just protecting properties around the clock,” Porter remarked.\nAs of now, the blaze has consumed over 500 hectares, leading to the destruction of an undefined number of unoccupied homes and various structures in the vicinity.\nFurther complicating firefighting efforts, a high fire danger warning remains in effect for considerable parts of New South Wales, particularly the central ranges where the Home Hills Road fire is located. Porter noted, “Due to the steep terrain and the weather today, this fire may still continue to spread very quickly.” Anticipated worsening conditions as temperatures rise have heightened the urgency of the situation.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology is predicting potential showers and thunderstorms starting from the afternoon and extending into Thursday; however, these weather events may be detrimental for firefighting. “Unfortunately, they often bring more erratic winds, the chance of lightning strikes, and other ignitions,” cautioned Porter. Currently, the chances of significant rainfall appear slim.\nThe fire is actively burning in rugged terrain in Bogee, situated between Lithgow and Mudgee. Residents in Brogan Creek, Clandulla, Charbon, Mount Marsden, and Bogee have been advised to stay alert and monitor the evolving situation.\nIn addition, RFS crews are managing more than 55 active fires across the state. The Milsons Gully fire in Goulburn River National Park near Merriwa has been downgraded to advice level after residents were instructed to evacuate on Tuesday.",
