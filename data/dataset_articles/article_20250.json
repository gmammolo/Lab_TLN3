  "text": "Human-caused warming of the oceans intensified rainfall that led to deadly floods and landslides across Asia in recent weeks, according to a study released Wednesday.\nThe rapid analysis by World Weather Attribution (WWA) examined heavy rains from cyclones Senyar and Ditwah, which affected Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka starting late last month. Researchers found that elevated sea surface temperatures in the North Indian Ocean added energy to the storms.\nThe floods and landslides have claimed more than 1,600 lives, with hundreds still missing. The cyclones are the latest in a string of severe weather disasters hitting Southeast Asia this year, causing widespread damage.\n“It rains a lot here but never like this. Usually, rain stops around September, but this year it has been really bad. Every region of Sri Lanka has been affected, and our region has been the worst impacted,” said Shanmugavadivu Arunachalam, a schoolteacher in Hatton, Sri Lanka’s Central Province.\nWWA researchers said sea surface temperatures over the North Indian Ocean were 0.2°C (0.3°F) above the three-decade average. Without global warming, the waters would have been roughly 1°C (1.8°F) cooler, providing less heat and moisture to fuel the cyclones. Globally, temperatures are 1.3°C (2.6°F) higher than pre-industrial levels, according to NOAA.\n“When the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture. As a result, it rains more in a warmer atmosphere compared to a world without climate change,” said Mariam Zachariah of Imperial College London, a report co-author.\nThe WWA, a network of researchers using peer-reviewed methods, conducts rapid studies to link extreme weather events to climate change. While they could not quantify exactly how much global warming contributed to these storms due to model limitations, their work highlights the role of climate change in amplifying disasters.\nExperts also noted that rapid urbanization, high population density, and infrastructure in low-lying areas increased vulnerability to floods. “The human toll from cyclones Ditwah and Senyar is staggering,” said Maja Vahlberg of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. “The most vulnerable people suffer the most and face the longest recovery.”",
