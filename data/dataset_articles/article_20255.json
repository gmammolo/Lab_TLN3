  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nThe Pro Vice-Chancellor of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Professor David Asamoah, says Africa must urgently strengthen its response to air pollution, warning that “the air we breathe is under siege” as the continent continues to record high pollution-related deaths.\nHe noted with concern the gravity of air pollution on the continent.\n“Air pollution causes over one million premature deaths every year in Africa. The air we breathe is under siege,” he stressed.\nIn Ghana alone, more than 32,000 people died in 2023 from exposure to polluted air, according to the State of Global Air 2025 report. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) 2025 report also shows that air pollution reduces the average Ghanaian’s life expectancy by almost nine months.\nProfessor Asamoah made the remarks on behalf of the Vice-Chancellor at the opening of the third African School on Air Quality and Pollution Prevention.\nThe two-week training programme, funded by the Clean Air Fund, received over 1,000 applications from 47 countries, out of which 70 participants were selected. They include professionals from fire services, environmental agencies, pharmacy, planning, journalism, and public health.\nProfessor Asamoah commended young Africans for their growing involvement in developing clean-air solutions, saying, “Across our universities and research institutions, young scientists are developing low-cost air monitoring devices, designing clean cookstoves, and advocating for climate-smart cities.”\nHe urged institutions to deepen investment in research, policy engagement and community outreach, adding, “Let us transform knowledge into leadership and leadership into action. Let us ensure that the next generation inherits a cleaner, safer and healthier continent.”\nProfessor Leonard Amekudzi, Principal Investigator for the project, said air quality research has become even more urgent due to population growth and rising human activities. He explained that the School, which began in 2018, has evolved into one of the university’s major training initiatives aimed at producing “clean air champions” who will advance research, advocacy, and public awareness across the continent.\n“Air quality is health-related, and health is life-related. We must talk about it, empower people with knowledge, and develop champions who will carry the message across Africa. We do not want to only publish research, we want to make real impact on the continent” he said.\nGhana Clean Air Fund Lead, Desmond Appiah, described air pollution as a “silent killer” and encouraged participants to apply what they learn in their home countries.\n“We don’t want you to go back and end the story. We want to see clean-air initiatives, advocacy, and action wherever you are. When people take action, governments pay attention,” he noted.\nHe urged them to work with local leaders, support waste segregation, and help reduce open burning and other pollution sources in their communities.",
