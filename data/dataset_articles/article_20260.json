  "text": "LONDON: Survivors of a deadly 2021 typhoon in the Philippines have filed a lawsuit against British oil giant Shell, seeking financial compensation for climate-related devastation, three NGOs supporting them said Thursday.\nTyphoon Rai struck the southern and central regions of the Philippines in December 2021, toppling power lines and trees and unleashing deadly floods that killed over 400 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.\nThe lawsuit on behalf of 103 survivors argues Shell’s carbon emissions contributed to climate change, impacting Philippine communities.\nTrixy Elle, a plaintiff from a fishing community whose home and four boats were swept away in the typhoon, told AFP the lawsuit was about getting justice.\n“Island residents like us contribute only a small percentage of pollution. But who gets the short stick? The poor like us,” said the 34-year-old, who is still paying off high-interest loans she needed to rebuild.\n“I am not speaking only for my community but for all Filipinos who experience the effects of climate crises,” Elle said, adding that her now 13-year-old son still suffers from trauma caused by the storm.\nIn a joint statement, the NGOs backing the suit said it represents “a decisive step to hold oil giant Shell accountable for the deaths, injuries and destruction left by the climate-fueled storm.”\nWhile typhoons are a regular weather pattern in Southeast Asia, scientists have long warned that climate change is making storms more intense because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and warmer seas can turbocharge the systems.\nIn Manila on Thursday, Greenpeace climate campaigner Virginia Benosa-Llorin called the lawsuit a “test case to hold the corporations accountable.”\nThe suit will be the “first time claimants in the Global South are bringing action related to significant personal injury and property damage... caused through the alleged acts of common measures in the Global North,” added UK-based lawyer Joe Snape via videolink.\n- Lost ‘everything’ -\nPlaintiff Rickcel Inting, a fisherman, told AFP his family had lost “everything in an instant” when Typhoon Rai slammed into Bohol province, surviving only because they lashed themselves to a thick column on their rooftop.\n“Shell caused what we have suffered because of its actions, causing pollution and harming the environment... they owe poor individuals like us,” said the 46-year-old, adding he had never been able to afford to replace his lost fishing boats.\nThe lawsuit marks the latest step in a wider international movement to assign responsibility to major companies for climate damage.\nA German court in May ruled that firms could, in principle, be held responsible for harm caused by their emissions, fueling hopes that other countries would follow suit.\nShell dismissed the lawsuit as “a baseless claim,” with a spokesperson saying “it will not help tackle climate change or reduce emissions.”\n“The suggestion that Shell had unique knowledge about climate change is simply not true,” the firm added.\n- Oil profits -\nThe claimants are seeking financial compensation for “lives lost, injuries sustained and homes destroyed,” NGOs supporting the lawsuit said.\nShell, along with many rival energy giants, has scaled back various climate objectives to focus more on oil and gas in order to raise profits.\nThe United Nations in 2022 said destruction caused by Typhoon Rai was “badly underestimated” in initial assessments, tripling the number of people “seriously affected” to nine million.\nThe Philippines — ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impact of climate change — is hit by an average of 20 storms every year.\nThe UK lawsuit follows a historic climate ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague in July, which declared states had an obligation under international law to address the threat of climate change.\nICJ advisory opinions are not legally enforceable but are seen as highly authoritative in steering national courts, legislation and corporate behavior around the globe.\nFilipino typhoon survivors sue Shell over climate change\nFilipino typhoon survivors sue Shell over climate change\nTens of thousands in Washington could face evacuations as rain continues to pound the region\n- Days of seemingly unrelenting heavy rain had already triggered rescues and road closures\n- More than 17,000 customers in Washington had lost electricity by Wednesday night\nMOUNT VERNON, Washington: Tens of thousands of residents in western Washington could face evacuation orders when another round of heavy rain drops on the region Thursday, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding as rivers near historic levels.\nDays of seemingly unrelenting heavy rain had already triggered rescues and road closures, and by Wednesday, Gov. Bob Ferguson declared a statewide emergency, warning that “lives will be at stake in the coming days.” Some residents have already been ordered to higher ground, with Skagit County, a major agricultural region north of Seattle, ordering those within the Skagit River’s floodplain to evacuate.\n“Catastrophic flooding is likely” in many areas and the state is requesting water rescue teams and boats, Ferguson said on the social media platform X on Wednesday night.\nHundreds of Guard members will be sent to help communities, said Gent Welsh, adjutant general of the Washington National Guard.\nIn a valley leading out to the foothills of Mount Rainier southeast of Seattle, Pierce County sheriff’s deputies on Wednesday rescued people at an RV park in Orting, including helping one man in a Santa hat wade through waist-deep water. Part of the town was ordered to evacuate over concerns about the Puyallup River’s extremely high levels and upstream levees.\nA landslide blocked part of Interstate 90 east of Seattle, with photos from Eastside Fire & Rescue showing vehicles trapped by tree trunks, branches, mud and standing water. Officials also closed a mountainous section of US 2 due to rocks, trees and mud.\nMore than 17,000 customers in Washington had lost electricity by Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.us.\nFlooding rivers could break records\nThe Skagit River is expected to crest at roughly 14.3 meters in the mountain town of Concrete early Thursday, and roughly 12 meters in Mount Vernon early Friday.\n“We feel very confident that we can handle a ‘normal flood,’ but no one really knows what a 41, 42 foot river looks like south of Mount Vernon,” Darrin Morrison, a commissioner for Dike District 3 in Skagit County, said during a public meeting Wednesday night.\nThe county was closing non-essential government services on Thursday, including all district and superior court services.\nFlooding from the river has long plagued Mount Vernon, the largest city in the county with some 35,000 residents. Flooding in 2003 displaced hundreds of people.\nThe city completed a floodwall in 2018 that helps protect the downtown. It passed a major test in 2021, when the river crested near record levels.\nBut the city is on high alert. The historic river levels expected Friday could top the wall, and some are worried that older levees could fail.\n“It could potentially be catastrophic,” said Ellen Gamson, executive director of the Mount Vernon Downtown Association.\nJake Lambly added sandbags, tested water pumps and moved valuables to the top floor of the home he shares with his 19-year-old son.\n“This is my only asset,” he said Wednesday from his front porch. “I got nothing else.”\nCities respond to flooding\nHarrison Rademacher, a meteorologist with the weather service in Seattle, described the atmospheric river soaking the region as “a jet stream of moisture” stretching across the Pacific Ocean “with the nozzle pushing right along the coast of Oregon and Washington.”\nIn Sumas, a small city along the US-Canada border, a flood siren rang out at city hall and residents were told to leave. The border crossing was also closed to southbound commercial vehicles to leave more room for evacuations, according to the Abbotsford Police Department.\nClimate change has been linked to some intense rainfall. Scientists say that without specific study they cannot directly link a single weather event to climate change, but in general it’s responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme storms, droughts, floods and wildfires.\nAnother storm system is expected to bring more rain starting Sunday.\n“The pattern looks pretty unsettled going up to the holidays,” Rademacher said.\nDays of seemingly unrelenting heavy rain had already triggered rescues and road closures, and by Wednesday, Gov.
