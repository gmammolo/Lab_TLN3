  "text": "The Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the city’s controversial Surfliner Inn project is expected to be released early next year, Carpinteria City Principal Planner Mindy Fogg confirmed at Monday night’s Carpinteria City Council meeting, following a public comment section inundated with project critics.\n“We’re making good progress on the draft EIR,” Fogg told the council.\nThe Surfliner Inn project — a boutique hotel proposed for the city’s Parking Lot #3, also known as the Amtrak Parking Lot — has been making its way through the city review process for several years.\nThe city first put out a request for hotel development proposals back in 2017, hoping to rent the lot out and partner with a developer to boost the local economy and improve foot traffic. The city council approved 499 Linden Managers LLC as the developer, but the two-story, 36-room inn has faced several hurdles since, including a petition and election to rezone the lot to prevent any development, which narrowly failed. The city’s Architectural Review Board last December granted preliminary design approval to the project.\nSurfliner Inn critics on Monday asked questions about the project’s review process and questioned the information used to choose 499 Linden Managers LLC — a group of locals — as the developer.\nAlan Koch, who has spoken out against the project at several city meetings, added on Monday that he believes critical Request for Proposal (RFP) information remains missing to thoroughly vet the development group, such as the financial ability to build and operate a hotel and a detailed business plan. Other speakers said more information is needed about the possible environmental impacts of Parking Lot #4, proposed for the other side of the railroad tracks as part of the Surfliner project.",
