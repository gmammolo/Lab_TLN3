  "text": "Justice Department Bans Participation in ABA Events\nU.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has prohibited Justice Department attorneys from attending or speaking at American Bar Association events, citing the ABA's involvement in activist causes that conflict with government interests. The decision aims to preserve the department's mission to remain fair and impartial.\nIn a significant move, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the prohibition of Justice Department attorneys from attending American Bar Association (ABA) events. This decision was revealed in a memo obtained by Reuters.\nThe memo accuses the ABA of engaging in activist causes that are contrary to the interests of the government, highlighting current litigation involving the department and the ABA. Blanche expressed concerns about using taxpayer dollars on activities perceived to undermine the department's mission.\nBlanche emphasized that while the ABA is free to pursue its activist agendas, the Justice Department must avoid any official participation that might compromise its fairness and effectiveness.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
