  "text": "A new report has found that 90% of Ireland's EU-protected habitats are in 'unfavourable’ conservation status, with 51% showing deteriorating trends across their national ranges.\nThis includes sites designated as Special Areas of Conservation as well as the wider countryside.\nThe report also shows 58% of Ireland’s EU-protected species to be in 'favourable' conservation status and over two-thirds showing either stable or improving trends.\nThere are 59 EU-protected habitats in Ireland and 60 protected species.\nThe report on the status of habitats and species, commonly referred to as the Article 17 report, is required to be published every six years under the EU Habitats Directive.\nSemi-natural and natural Irish habitats across marine, freshwater, coastal, peatland, grassland, woodland, rock, fen and heath ecosystems are included.\nThe species covered include all types of whales and dolphins, all bat species, otter, mountain hare, pine marten, as well as certain plants, invertebrates, fish and three amphibian and reptile species.\nThe report highlights how over two-thirds of habitats are impacted by agricultural-related activities, particularly inappropriate grazing, drainage, and pollution.\nInvasive and problematic species, recreational activities and pollution are also impacting habitat quality.\nFreshwater species are under pressure from water pollution.\nHowever, the report indicates that Ireland is an EU stronghold for many of the listed plant and bat species.\nIn addition, otters, frogs and seals continue to thrive here and many of Ireland’s whale species were found to be in good status.\nIt also shows the habitats for pine martens, and three bat species are expanding, while juniper scrub, dune heath, submarine structures and caves are in favourable status.\nAgainst that, there are ongoing pressures impacting freshwater habitats and coastal marine habitats.\nWoodland habitats are being impacted by deer grazing and other invasive species such as Rhododendron.\nAlso pearl muscle is very sensitive to agricultural and forestry related pollution, while white claw crayfish have been impacted by plague.\nThe analysis also suggests that concerted strategic conservation measures, such as the restoration of bogs by Bord na Móna (BnM) and conservation measures to protect Lesser Horseshoe Bats, are responsible for an improving trend.\nIn addition, the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan has made a major impact on the expansion of Hay Meadows which is a positive development.\nMinister of State for Nature, Heritage and Biodiversity Christopher O’Sullivan said that Ireland must be \"heartened by the huge effort under way across all corners of the country to protect and restore our natural world, and remind ourselves of the need for patience: while nature can bounce back quickly, the recovery of habitats and species to the high standards set out in the Habitats Directive can take time.\n\"We must also redouble our commitment to nature by continuing investment, strengthening collaboration and improving delivery as we strive to stop the loss of biodiversity and move towards a future where it is protected and restored.\nDirector General of the NPWS Niall Ó Donnchú said that nature \"cannot be rebuilt in a day, nor, in many cases, even in a decade\".\n\"The real time to begin was yesterday. And though today’s findings may feel disheartening, they also reveal the quiet but powerful momentum of nature and species renewal already under way,\" he said.\nThe report's findings will help to guide the implementation of Ireland’s National Biodiversity Action Plan and inform future restoration programmes including the national Nature Restoration Plan required by the EU Nature Restoration Regulation.",
