  "text": "NATCHITOCHES PARISH, La. (KALB) - A registered sex offender who failed to comply with Louisiana’s sex offender registration laws has been arrested, according to the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office.\nNPSO said Eduardo Garibay had maintained his registration in Texas, but did not fulfill his legal obligation to register in Louisiana after living in Natchitoches Parish for over a year.\nEduardo Garibay (Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office) NPSO obtained an arrest warrant for Garibay for one count of failure to register as a sex offender under Louisiana law.\nA search warrant was executed at his residence as well. Authorities found two firearms, one of which was a .357 Magnum Smith and Wesson Revolver, found to have been reported as stolen by the Desoto Parish Sheriff’s Office. The second firearm, a .22 caliber Savage Rifle, was reported as lost through a Texas law enforcement agency.\nAs a convicted felon, Garibay is prohibited from possessing firearms.\nOn April 7, Garibay was arrested and booked into the LaSalle Corrections for one count of failure to register as a sex offender, two counts of possession of a firearm by a person convicted of certain felonies and one count of illegal possession of a stolen firearm.\nThe Natchitoches Parish Sheriff’s Office urges the public to report any information about non-compliant sex offenders. Tips can be submitted anonymously on the NPSO website at npsheriff.org . Information regarding registered sex offenders in the area can also be accessed via the website or by calling the NPSO Criminal Investigations Bureau at 318-357-7830.",
