  "text": "By Ethan Carey ,\n3 hours ago Natilyn Hicks What We K now About Connecticut’s Roads\nAccording to a recent report from ctpublic.org , Connecticut ranks as the 5th worst state in the U.S. for overall road conditions, based on poor-road metrics from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)’s Highway Performance Monitoring System. The same report notes that more than 2,100 miles of Connecticut roads are classified as in poor condition — and that “harsh winter weather exacerbates pavement deterioration.”\nDownload the WRKI Mobile App Now Why Bridges and Overpasses Freeze First\nExperts point out that bridges and overpasses are the biggest troublemakers, freezing long before the roadways around them. It’s like they’re trying to win a contest none of us asked them to enter. Add in the cracks, potholes, and uneven pavement that winter tends to exaggerate, and you get conditions that change faster than your mood when someone drives 40 in the passing lane.\nRead More: Unlocking Winter’s Secrets: How Will Winter 2026 Look In Danbury\nThe First Storm: A Not-So-Gentle Reminder\nDuring the season’s first significant snowfall, Connecticut saw multiple spinouts and a few serious crashes — a reminder that winter weather doesn’t need to be dramatic to be dangerous. Black ice remains the silent villain, especially on backroads, shaded areas, and the winding hills that make Fairfield and Litchfield County so… “scenic.”\nThe “Highlight Reel” of Winter Driving Fails This year’s first legit storm already gave us the highlight reel: spinouts, rollovers, vehicles doing interpretive dance on I-84. One poor tractor-trailer ended up sideways like it was trying to parallel park across three lanes.\nRead More : Will Pumping the Gas Pedal Heat Up Your Car Faster During CT Winters\nRoad Crews Do Their Best — But Nature Doesn’t Care\nRoad crews, to their credit, are out early and often, but even the best plow team can’t keep up with sudden refreezing overnight. That’s why officials recommend slowing down, braking gently, and leaving extra space between vehicles. Yes, even if you swear your SUV “handles great in snow.”\nThe Bottom Line: Respect the Season Winter driving in Connecticut isn’t about panic — it’s about respect. Respect for the weather, respect for the roads, and respect for the fact that the guy in front of you might not have cleared his roof off. Stay alert, stay patient, and most importantly, stay on all four wheels.\n6 Restaurants Ideal for Winter Dining in Connecticut Google Street View Fife 'n Drum Restaurant - 53 Main Street, Kent, CT The Fife 'n Drum is one of our favorite restaurants in Connecticut because of its warm and inviting atmosphere, excellent food, and the talented musicians who play the piano on Friday and Saturday evenings.\nHouse specialties are prepared tableside and include Caesar Salad for Two, Filet Mignon au Poivre, and Roast Half Duck Flambé and t hey offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options on all of their menus.

Gallery Credit: Large Dave/Google Google Hot Chocolate at Kimberly Farm - New Milford At the suggestion of State Representative Bill Buckbee, Mrs. Large and I stopped at New Milford's Kimberly Farm and got ourselves two cups of their hot chocolate.
