  "text": "FALL RIVER, MA — A man faces criminal charges after allegedly dumping patio furniture and a pool liner near a drinking water reservoir.\nOfficer William Medeiros of the Environmental Unit was notified on Monday of an illegal dumping incident near the Watuppa Pond/Wilson Road Causeway.\nDespite being off duty, Medeiros immediately coordinated with Officer Nelson Brum to begin investigating.\nUsing video surveillance technology, officers identified a suspect vehicle and located footage showing a pickup truck carrying patio furniture and a pool liner, items identical to those dumped at the site.\nWatuppa Pond is a naturally occurring reservoir that supplies drinking water to Fall River and surrounding communities.\nDuring the investigation, the suspect offered to return to clean up the items he illegally discarded.\nThe department is asking citizens and visitors to the BioReserve and Reservation area to contact police at 508-676-8511 if they see suspicious activity, or submit an anonymous tip by calling 508-672-8477.",
