  "text": "Alleged fake rideshare driver and serial rapist Alvin Campbell is accused of assaulting a correctional officer at the Suffolk County jail.\nCampbell, 44, was arraigned at the central Boston Municipal Court on one count of assault and battery on a correctional facility employee. The accused serial rapist had another $150 tacked onto his bail for these new charges, for which he’s due back in court April 24 for a pretrial hearing.\n“Just like we often see with all our other law enforcement partners, the daily duties of a correctional officer can be unpredictable,” Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement announcing the new charges against Campbell. “I am thankful the situation here was quickly contained.”\nCampbell, who is the brother of Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, is charged in his main case with sexually assaulting nine women while posing as an Uber driver between 2017 and 2019.\nThe alleged assault that incurred this latest legal trouble happened on Nov. 27 of last year, when a correctional officer reported that Campbell had punched him twice in the face before 9 a.m. Campbell apparently tried to take a uniform top that wasn’t his during recreation time and reacted poorly to the officer telling him to leave the top alone. Campbell allegedly unleashed a tirade of curses before resorting to his fists.\nCampbell, who was a Rhode Island resident at the time, was arrested in January 2020 and charged with numerous counts of rape and kidnapping. He would be indicted on crimes against a total of nine women .\nProsecutors say that Campbell, who already had a long rap sheet , posed as a rideshare driver, and sometimes a bar bouncer, and would pick up blackout-drunk women around Boston. They would pass out in his car, prosecutors say, and Campbell would use his phone to record himself sexually assaulting them.\nCampbell’s rape trial has been pushed back time and again as he goes through a series of defense lawyers. Court documents indicate his latest trial date is set for Sept. 8, five and a half years after he was indicted on the charges.",
