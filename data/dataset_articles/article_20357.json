  "text": "A strong atmospheric river is hammering the Pacific Northwest, driving widespread flooding as multiple rivers in Washington state surge to major flood stage, potentially forcing evacuations.\nNational Weather Service (NWS) officials warn that residents along the Snohomish and Skagit rivers in Western Washington could experience life-threatening and “catastrophic” flooding Thursday due to the week’s relentless heavy rainfall. (RELATED: Polar Vortex Could Trigger Major Snowstorm, Soul-Piercing Freeze Across Interstate 95 Corridor)\nOfficials have issued evacuation orders for portions of Orting in Pierce County, Ebey Island in Snohomish County and Skagit County within the 100-year floodplain.\nThe office of Gov. Bob Ferguson announced Wednesday afternoon that as many as 100,000 Washington residents may be ordered to evacuate due to quickly rising floodwaters.\nWe anticipate potentially 100,000 Washingtonians facing evacuation orders. The situation is fluid and changing all the time. We expect rivers to hit historic levels as early as 4 a.m. tomorrow, lasting into Friday morning.\nMake sure you are signed up for emergency alerts with…\n— Governor Bob Ferguson (@GovBobFerguson) December 11, 2025\nThe governor has declared a state of emergency and announced he will seek federal funding to support flood response and recovery efforts. He went on to thank first responders and also stated to the public, “ If you receive an evacuation order, please, please follow that order. It is critical for your safety,” per The Seattle Times .\nThe NWS has warned of “catastrophic” flooding from Mount Vernon into Everett and through parts east of Redmond. This level of flooding poses a severe threat to both life and property, with a high likelihood of levees getting overtopped and landslides in terrain that’s steep.\nSteve Reedy, a meteorologist for the NWS, warned that the flooding could reach record levels, destroying roads and buildings while necessitating evacuations and rescues.\n“I’ve been working here at the Seattle office for 12 years and I have never seen anything like this,” said Reedy, per The Seattle Times.",
