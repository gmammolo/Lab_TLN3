  "text": "The Telegraph has learned that one of the UK's largest police services has temporarily blocked applications from white British candidates in an attempt to increase diversity\nThe Telegraph has learned that one of the UK's largest police services has temporarily blocked applications from white British candidates in an attempt to increase diversity.\nWest Yorkshire Police (WYP) currently does not allow white British applicants to apply for jobs as recruits in its recruitment programs as police constables. However, \"underrepresented\" groups can submit their applications in advance.\nThe process has raised concerns that white British candidates are being treated unfairly, which amounts to a form of positive discrimination that could be potentially illegal.\nWYP stated that the policy is aimed at ensuring that their officers represent \"diverse communities.\" But former officers accused her of actually pursuing a \"hidden\" recruitment policy aimed at certain groups.\nOne of the sources of the publication claimed that black and Asian candidates from the Far East are considered particularly underrepresented and are given a \"gold\" rating, followed by people from Southeast Asia, who are at the silver level. The \"white others,\" including candidates of Irish and Eastern European descent, received a bronze rating.",
