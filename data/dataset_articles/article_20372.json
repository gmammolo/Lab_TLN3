  "text": "Emergency warnings have been issued for the two blazes, one around Kenwick, in the city's east, the other further north in Upper Swan.\nThe Kenwick fire broke out around midday (AWST) and has since burned along Boundary Road and into the Kenwick Wetlands.\nPeople in the area, in the parts of Kenwick, Wattle Grove, Maddington and Beckenham bounded by Welshpool Road East, Tonkin Highway, Kenwick Road, Brixton Street and Roe Highway, have been told to leave to the south if it is safe to do so.\n\"You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes,\" the emergency warning states.\n\"Homes in Bickley Road, Brook Road and Boundary Road are under threat by fire now.\"\nFire crews are on the scene battling the fire.\nIt is not clear if any buildings have been lost to the blaze.\nFurther north, people in Upper Swan, Bullsbrook and Walyunga National Park – those east of Great Northern Highway, north of the Swan River and south of Stock Road – have also been told to evacuate, this time to the west.\nThe northerly blaze was first reported just before 1pm (AWST), and is still uncontained and uncontrolled, despite the efforts of firefighters.\nMore to come.\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
