  "text": "Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. A bushfire raging in Perth’s east has sparked an emergency warning, with residents in parts of Kenwick, Wattle Grove, Maddington and Beckenham urged to leave immediately. The fire was reported just after midday on Thursday, and aerial crews have already been called in as firefighters battle the blaze in bushland to the east of Kenwick Wetlands Nature Reserve. Residents in an area bounded by Welshpool Road East, Tonkin Highway, Kenwick Road, Brixton Street and Roe Highway are under an emergency warning alert, with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services warning there is a threat to lives and homes. “Homes in Bickley Road are under threat by fire now,” a department alert reads. Those fleeing the area are urged to head south towards Albany Highway. Several roads have been closed, including Wanaping Road and Bickley Road. More to come.",
