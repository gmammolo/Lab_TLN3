  "text": "'It's time to go': Evacuations ordered ahead of historic flooding of Skagit River\nSKAGIT COUNTY, Wash. — People who live near the Skagit River have been asked to evacuate as forecasts predict record-level flooding over the next two days.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the river will enter major flood stage early Thursday morning and remain there through Friday.\nThe river is projected to reach 42 feet at Mount Vernon, which would break the previous flood record of 37.4 feet.\nState officials issued a Level 3 \"Go Now\" evacuation order for everyone living in the 100-year flood plain of the Skagit River.\nLINK | Map of 100-year flood plain\n“We’re asking people to heed the warnings and make early exits,\" said Matt Stratton, a fire commissioner with Skagit County Fire District 3. “I have never heard numbers like this. If the numbers are true, please leave, it’s time to go.”\nThe fire district held a meeting at their station in Conway where around 75 residents attended and were able to ask emergency managers questions.\n“Fortunately we had a lot of people turn out tonight, so I think the word is getting out,\" Stratton said.\nThe fire district is posting real-time updates on their Facebook page and area asking residents to stay alert.\nIn Mount Vernon, city officials released a video press release updating citizens on the projected flood estimates and evacuations.\nEvacuations are also underway in Sedro-Woolley, where residents at the Birchview Memory Care center were evacuated with the help of Skagit Transit, the Sedro-Wooley School District, Helping Hands Food Bank, and Sedro-Woolley fire crews Wednesday evening.\nLINK | Sign up for emergency alerts in Skagit County\nEarlier in the day Wednesday, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson declared a state of emergency and activated the Washington National Guard to assist with the emergency response to the flooding.\n“If you receive an evacuation order, please please follow that order this is critical for your safety,\" Ferguson said.\nINFORMATION FROM SKAGIT COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\nEmergency Shelters / Resources\nThe Skagit County Emergency Operations Center is coordinating shelters with local organizations, churches, towns, and the American Red Cross.
