  "text": "DOUGLASS TWP., Pa. – People packed the room at Gilbertsville Fire and Rescue in Douglass Township, Montgomery County — all focused on the old Boyertown Landfill.\nThe landfill closed in 1987. But the problems didn't stop. Homes nearby are now testing positive for PFAS, the so-called \"forever chemicals,\" perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.\n\"We had our water tested, and I'm told it's not passing standards. People from the Environmental Protection Agency put a filtration system in our house for free and had given us bottled water,\" said resident Kelly Yorgey, who attended Tuesday night's meeting.\nYorgey said she came to hear more about what's happening.\n“I don't want to assume anything. I want to give people a chance to explain things,\" she said.\nNeighbors filled the room, asking questions and demanding clarity.\nThat clarity came from state DEP environmental protection specialist Colin Wade.\n\"Since its closure, it was poorly maintained by the company that was supposed to maintain it, so DEP has had to step in numerous times over the past few decades to do the work,\" Wade explained.\nWade said the real issue is what DEP found after beginning years of testing.\n\"We sampled the landfill for a group of man-made compounds known as... PFAS,\" he explains. “People might have heard about these as 'forever chemicals.'\"\nDEP estimates up to 150 people are directly impacted and more could be added as the investigation continues and concerns grow.\nThe EPA and DEP say testing, monitoring and filter installations will continue.",
