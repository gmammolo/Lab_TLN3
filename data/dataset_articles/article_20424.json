  "text": "A parliamentary panel has raised serious concerns over the prolonged delays in environment and forest clearances for coal mining projects, recommending the government streamline procedures, strengthen digital systems and improve coordination among agencies involved in the approval process. Presenting its 15th report on “Expediting and Simplifying the Environment and Forest Clearance Process for Coal Mining Projects” in the Lok Sabha on December 10, the Standing Committee on Coal, Mines and Steel, chaired by BJP leader and Member of Parliament Anurag Singh Thakur, said despite efforts to boost coal production and reduce import dependence, the clearances continue to face significant delays. Forest clearances taking up to 34 months Reviewing the forest clearance process, the report said the multi-tier appraisal — from divisional forest officer (DFO) to chief conservator of forests (CCFs) to state screening committees and the forest advisory committee (FAC) — results in lengthy evaluations. While acknowledging the institutional checks, it recommended that the environment ministry consider “increasing the frequency of meetings of FAC so as to speed up the project approvals”. The committee also pointed to significant differences in clearance timelines between public and private operators. It noted that while environment clearances (ECs) take 15–18 months for central PSUs, they take about 26 months for private commercial coal blocks. For forest clearances, the delay widens — 24–30 months for PSUs and up to 34 months for private sector blocks. The panel said it “desired to be apprised of the reasons for this difference” and called for efforts to reduce timelines across the board. To reduce delays caused by fragmented responsibilities across agencies, the committee recommended exploring a coordinated mechanism involving project proponents, state environment authorities, environment ministry and other stakeholders. Clearance gaps remain outside digital systems The committee also pointed out that several key approvals, including those from the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS), Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and state water departments, remain outside the digital ecosystem. This leads to duplication and delayed execution, especially in overlapping regulatory cases, it said. The committee recommended integrating DGMS permissions and no objection certificates from CGWA and water resource departments into the single-window clearance system framework. It urged the government to intensify coordination across ministries, strengthen digital platforms and rationalise procedures to ensure coal-mining projects move forward without compromising environmental safeguards. Only 12 ECs for sub-500 hectare projects Flagging the low number of approvals at the state level, the report said since April 22, 2022, “only 12 environmental clearances have been granted for projects below 500 hectares”. Calling this a matter of concern, the committee said it “desired to be apprised of the number of applications received… and the number of applications rejected and the reasons thereof”.\",",
