  "text": "Washington underwater as atmospheric river unleashes rain havoc. What happened?\nWith ocean and air temperatures rising, atmospheric rivers are becoming more frequent, wetter and longer than before.\nWashington state in the United States is witnessing flooded towns, washed out roads, and emergency evacuations. Rivers and streams are rising fast, with some areas already under flood warnings.\nThe dire conditions were brought by heavy rains caused by a massive atmospheric river. But, what really is an atmospheric river? And why does it cause such devastation?\nRIVER IN THE SKY\nAn atmospheric river is like a ribbon of water vapour in the sky. It is a long, narrow corridor of moist air carried by jet-stream winds across oceans toward land.\nThese jets act like highways for moisture.\nWhen conditions are right, especially strong low-level winds and high humidity, the band acts like a conveyor belt transporting enormous amounts of vapour.\nAs the moist air hits land, especially mountainous coastal zones, it rises, cools and condenses into clouds. And then, naturally, rain or snow follows.\nThis uplift effect is called an orographic lift, and it is often what turns a harmless cloud of moisture into a potent rainmaker.\nBRINGING RAIN AND RISKS\nOn a global scale, atmospheric rivers are Earth’s largest mechanism for moving freshwater from the tropics to higher latitude regions.\nThey are crucial also because they supply much of the rain or snow for reservoirs and groundwater recharge, both of which are vital for drinking water, agricultural irrigation, and ecosystems.\nBut when these sky-rivers are particularly strong, or when they pass over the same region in quick succession, things can go wrong. Heavy, persistent precipitation can saturate soils, overwhelm rivers and drainage systems, and trigger floods or landslides; Washington can attest to that.\nIn places like Washington, with rugged terrain and mountains, the risk grows even greater. As moist air climbs the slopes, rainfall intensifies, making floods or rock slides more likely.\nCLIMATE CHANGE INCREASING RISKS\nScientists warn that atmospheric rivers are changing, and not for the better. With ocean and air temperatures rising, atmospheric rivers are becoming more frequent, wetter and longer than before.\nAs a result, rainfall, even outside monsoon seasons, can become extreme.\nWhat used to be seasonal rain has started to hit at odd times, with heavier downpours and more frequent flooding. Moreover, these rivers are shifting their patterns globally.\nThey are changing their traditional paths and reaching latitudes and regions that saw fewer of them earlier.\nThat means places like Washington, and many coastal or mountainous regions around the world, may see unpredictable, powerful rain events more often.\nWASHINGTON LOOKS AHEAD\nFor Washington’s residents, the storm brought by this atmospheric river is more than just rough weather. It’s an urgent water hazard. As rain continues to fall and the ground remains soaked, riverbanks could break, floods may deepen, and landslides may threaten hillsides and communities that reside there.\nThey have been advised to stay alert, to follow evacuation orders, avoid flooded roads, and prepare for the possibility of extended flooding.\nWhile they prepare for the worse, it has once again become apparent that climate change is worsening and, along with it, so are many natural occurrences.\nFollowing the trend, atmospheric rivers are likely to bring heavier rain more often. Understanding them is no longer optional but essential for building resilience.",
