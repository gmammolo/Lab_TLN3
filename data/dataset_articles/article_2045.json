  "text": "Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., introduced legislation Wednesday aimed at exposing what pro-life advocates call a hidden flow of taxpayer dollars to abortion businesses, particularly Planned Parenthood, with the ultimate goal of cutting off taxpayer funding to the nation’s largest abortion chain.\nThe Abortion Funding Awareness Act of 2025 would require states to report detailed information on Medicaid payments to abortion businesses, including the amount of funding, the number of abortions performed, gestational ages of the unborn children killed, and methods used to kill them.\nBanks and his supporters argue the measure is a critical step toward transparency and ending what they see as an abuse of public funds.\n“These states are allowing taxpayer money to pay for abortions, with no way for Americans to track how many abortions they have paid for or the gestational age of the unborn child that was killed. Most Americans on both sides of the aisle agree that the government should not pay for abortions,” a statement from Banks says.\nHELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation !\nThe legislation comes amid a renewed push by pro-life lawmakers in the second Trump administration, backed by a Republican-controlled Congress, to hold abortion companies accountable. Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind., is introducing a companion bill in the House, amplifying the effort.\nPro-life groups, including Americans United for Life and SBA Pro-Life America, hailed the bill as a victory for accountability.\nThe move follows ongoing legal battles, including a case before the U.S. Supreme Court where South Carolina is fighting to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. That case, argued last week, could set a precedent for states to redirect funding away from abortion providers to comprehensive health care alternatives. Pro-life advocates see Banks’ bill as a complementary effort to dismantle federal support for the abortion giant.\nCritics point out that federal law, through the Hyde Amendment, already prohibits direct funding of abortions, though 20 states use Medicaid to cover the procedure under broader health care provisions. Banks’ bill, however, seeks to quantify these payments, arguing that even indirect support bolsters an industry that did nearly 393,000 abortions in 2022-2023, according to Planned Parenthood’s latest annual report.\nPublic opinion appears to align with the pro-life push for oversight. A January Marist/Knights of Columbus poll found 57% of Americans oppose using tax dollars for abortions, a sentiment echoed by Rep. Houchin.\nUnder the proposed law, states would submit annual reports to the Department of Health and Human Services within 60 days of the fiscal year’s end, with Congress receiving a summary within 90 days. The data would be publicly available, arming pro-life advocates with ammunition to press for defunding measures.\nThe bill’s introduction coincides with heightened scrutiny of Planned Parenthood, including recent Trump administration actions freezing tens of millions in funding for review. For pro-life leaders, it’s a moment of momentum.",
