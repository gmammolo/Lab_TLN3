  "text": "No amount of spin from Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen can obscure the harsh reality that Australia’s stuttering renewables rollout is a clear and present danger to Labor’s emission reduction goals.\nSlow approvals, sluggish buildouts and massive cost blowouts now define the clean energy transition.

The Australian Financial Review’s succinct take on the principles at stake in major domestic and global stories – and what policy makers should do about them.\nSave Log in or Subscribe to save article\nShare\nCopy link\nCopied\nEmail\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nFacebook\nCopy link\nCopied\nShare via...
