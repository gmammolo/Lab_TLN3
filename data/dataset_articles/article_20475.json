  "text": "Earlier this week, a heartbreaking discovery on the side of a busy road underscored the vulnerability of South Africa’s wildlife. A passer-by noticed what appeared to be a Vervet monkey lying motionless near the verge of the road. As the man approached, he realised that the adult female had already died, but something was still moving.\nClinging to her body was her infant.\nThe concerned member of the public immediately contacted the SPCA for assistance. An Inspector rushed to the scene, where both mother and baby were gently collected and brought to safety. Despite urgent intervention, the SPCA confirmed that the infant had suffered a broken spine and was completely paralysed.\nVeterinarians determined that the most humane option was to euthanise the baby to prevent further suffering. She is now, as the SPCA noted, “reunited with her mother — safe, free, and no longer in pain.”\nThe organisation says the incident serves as a sobering reminder of the dangers animals face near busy roads.\nThey are urging motorists to slow down when wildlife is present and to act responsibly if an animal is struck.\nAccording to the SPCA, drivers who hit an animal must stop and seek help immediately. Failing to do so is an offence under the National Road Traffic Act.\n“Our team is here for all animals — big or small, domestic or wild. They depend on us, and together, we can protect them,” the SPCA said.\nAnyone who encounters an injured or distressed animal is urged to contact the SPCA on 016 422 1505.",
