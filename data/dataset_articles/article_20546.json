  "text": "BENTON COUNTY, Wash. – As fluctuating water levels continue to pose a threat, Benton County Emergency Management is emphasizing the importance of staying informed and prepared.\nFlooding has affected roads and low-lying areas across the county. Emergency officials are urging residents to stay informed and act early. They stress the need for residents to rely on official alerts, as conditions can change rapidly with ongoing rain and runoff.\n“The best way for residents to stay informed as conditions change is by signing up for Code Red. So that is our mass notification system. Please pay attention to what is being sent via Code Red. And if you haven’t signed up for Code Red, please do so now,” said Deanna Davis from Benton County Emergency Management.\nFire crews are actively helping residents protect their homes by distributing sandbags. Fire District Four is providing sandbags, especially to those in flood-prone areas.\n“Currently on site, we have over three yards of sand and plenty of sandbags. And we have more sand available any time on call to help fill this out,” said Benton County Fire District 4 Fire Chief, Paul Carlyle\nCrews advise that sandbags are most effective when placed early, before water reaches doors, garages and low-lying openings. Sandbags are also available at BCFD 2 in Benton City, behind the main station near the maintenance building.\nAccording to river gauges, the water rose 4 feet overnight and extended more than 10 feet onto the shore. Yesterday, the concrete boat launch was still visible; today, it is completely covered.\nFor those in need of sandbags, visit Benton County Fire District Four or Fire District Two in Benton City.",
