  "text": "Gang threatens liquor contractor, demands Rs 50L ransom\nA gang has reportedly demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh from a liquor contractor in Yamunanagar district. It has also threatened the contractor with dire consequences if he failed to fulfil the demand.\nOn the complaint of the contractor, Rinku Rana of Golni village of the district, a case has been registered against the gang members at Chhappar police station.\nThe complainant told the police that he had been working as a liquor contractor in the district for the past four-five years.\nHe alleged that gangster Virender Pratap, alias Kala Rana of Yamunanagar, had demanded a ransom of Rs 20 lakh from him in lieu of running liquor vends about three years ago, but he had refused to pay the amount.\nKala Rana's brother Surya Pratap, alias Noni Rana, and Sunny, active members of the gang, had fled abroad illegally and were operating the gang from there, he said.\n“On April 6, 2025, I received two WhatsApp calls on my phone at 10.35 pm from a foreign number, which I did not pick up. After that, I received five consecutive messages, threatening to kill me and my family if I did not pick up the phone,” he told the police.\nAt 10.52 pm, he received a WhatsApp call from the same number, which he picked up. “The caller identified himself as Noni Rana and said, 'You have escaped twice before. You have neither contributed your share in liquor contracts nor have you paid the money we demanded. Your three companions have already been killed. Now, it is your turn and that of your family. If you want to be safe, give Rs 50 lakh to Tarun Singari and Manish Singari within three days',” the complainant told the police.\nHe further said, “The caller also told me that if I told anyone, there would be consequences.”\nShots were fired at Rinku Rana's liquor vend in Harnaul village of Yamunanagar district on Tuesday. The vend was closed and seven-eight bullets hit the shutter. Rajesh Kumar, incharge of police post, Khera Lakkha Singh village, said the incident took place around 11.30 pm.",
