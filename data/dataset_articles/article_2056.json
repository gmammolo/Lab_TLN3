  "text": "NORRISTOWN — An Abington Township couple were convicted of conspiring in a scheme to discipline the woman’s 11-year-old daughter with a waterboarding technique that impeded the child’s ability to breathe.\n“They tried to waterboard me. I didn’t know what was happening. I couldn’t breathe. I was scared,” the girl, now 12, testified on Wednesday during the trial of her mother and stepfather in Montgomery County Court.\nThe girl, who most recently resided with her biological father in the Pottstown area, described for a judge that her mother, Aubrey Ott, instructed her to lean her head face up over a sink and then covered her face with a rag, pinched her nose and poured water over the cloth. The girl testified she believed she was being disciplined after the couple accused her of telling a lie.\nThe girl’s younger sister testified that before witnessing her mother take the victim into the bathroom and closing the door she overheard her stepfather, Gordon Ott, tell Aubrey, “This is what we did in the war.” Aubrey Ott, according to the child’s testimony, responded, “OK, I’ll do it.”\nBoth girls testified that the following morning, Aubrey Ott told them to “just forget what happened last night.”\nAfter hearing the testimony during the one day nonjury trial, Judge Steven T. O’Neill convicted Aubrey Ott, 38, of the 2300 block of Patton Road, of charges of strangulation blocking nose and mouth, endangering the welfare of a child, simple assault and conspiracy to commit those crimes in connection with the April 2024 incident.\nO’Neill, acting as sole factfinder, convicted Gordon Ott, 42, of charges of conspiracy to commit strangulation, conspiracy endangering the welfare of a child and conspiracy to engage in simple assault.\n“I did weigh credibility. I found the commonwealth’s witnesses were credible,” O’Neill said as he announced his verdict.\nThe Otts showed no emotion as the verdict was announced.\nThe father of the girls and other friends and relatives appeared relieved by the verdict. Several members of Bikers Against Child Abuse Montgomery County attended the trial to support the victim and her family.\nO’Neill deferred sentencing so that court officials can complete a background investigation report about the Otts. The couple remains free on bail pending sentencing hearings later this year. The couple potentially could face jail time.\nThe incident occurred on April 29, 2024, while the victim and her sister were on a weekend visit with their mother and stepfather, according to a criminal complaint filed by Abington Detective Jeffrey Anderson.\nThe victim told her father about the incident when she returned home the next day, and her father notified police.\n“(Aubrey Ott) knew exactly what she was doing. She knew this was a torture technique used in war. She impeded this child’s ability to breathe. Clearly, when you’re using a known technique used in war you are endangering your child,” Assistant District Attorney Anne Caitlyn O’Connell argued during her closing statement to the judge, maintaining Gordon Ott also was culpable for instructing his wife what to do.\n“There was a clear verbal agreement here. They had an agreement. She carried out the crime,” O’Connell argued.\nWhen Aubrey Ott testified in her own defense, she denied disciplining her daughter with a waterboarding technique. She claimed she “nicely” took her daughter into the bathroom and used water, soap and a towel to rub ink marker stains off of the girl’s face. Other than perhaps her daughter not liking that she was scrubbing too hard, Aubrey said her daughter was “fine” and was not crying.\nAubrey Ott claimed the alleged conversation with her husband about the “war technique” never occurred.\nGordon Ott did not testify during the trial.\nDefense lawyer Anthony J. Petrone, who represented Aubrey, and defense lawyer Richard J. Giuliani, who represented Gordon, argued prosecutors did not present sufficient evidence to support the charges against their clients.\n“There is a clear, reasonable doubt. This is a caring mother. This is not a mother endangering her child by any means,” Petrone argued on behalf of Aubrey Ott.\n“It’s ridiculous. It doesn’t make sense,” Giuliani added on behalf of Gordon Ott. “It’s completely bizarre.”\nO’Connell argued the children were credible and had no reason to fabricate the incident.\nThe defense lawyers also presented testimony from character witnesses who claimed the couple had a reputation for being peaceful and law-abiding.\nIn a criminal complaint, detectives claimed the children also described various other forms of punishment, including having to perform Army planks and drink hot sauce. However, those allegations were not brought forth during the trial, which focused solely on the waterboarding incident.",
