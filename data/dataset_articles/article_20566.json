  "text": "Dry recycling collections temporarily paused in Central Bedfordshire\nSuspension due to contractor issues; council working to restore services\nDry recycling collections across Central Bedfordshire are currently paused due to contractor-related issues, according to the council.\nThe suspended collections affect orange and green lid bins and have been implemented following the withdrawal of services by the contractor responsible for recycling treatment.\nThe council revealed the decision came after the contractor's recycling facility suffered a fire, leading to increased operational costs, which the contractor sought to pass onto the council.\nIn a statement, the council said, \"The contract we have protects the council in these circumstances, and we do not agree to pay this additional amount.\"\nThe council is now seeking alternative solutions to resume recycling collections, although no timeframe has yet been given.\nRecycling guidance for residents\nWhile dry recycling collection services are paused, residents are advised to store recyclable materials at home where possible. Green bins may be used for temporary storage, while limited use of black bins is also permitted as a last resort.\nThe council has confirmed that booking slots for Household Waste Recycling Centres remain available, offering an option for residents to dispose of recyclable materials safely.\nHowever, officials acknowledged this may not be suitable for everyone, especially those unable to travel.\nOther collections not affected\nRegular black bin collections for general waste and food waste services remain unaffected and will continue as normal.\nThe council assured residents it is working hard to resolve the disruption and will provide updates via its website and social media channels.\nResidents can also sign up for email alerts to receive notifications when recycling services resume.",
