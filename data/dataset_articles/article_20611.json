  "text": "Western Washington is currently facing a red alert situation as heavy rainfall has led to significant flooding in parts of Skagit, Snohomish, and King counties. Approximately 100,000 residents are at risk of evacuation due to the severe weather conditions. The National Weather Service has warned of up to 18 major floods and 15 moderate floods anticipated across the state.\nThe period of intense rainfall commenced on Monday, December 8, 2025, and continued to escalate throughout Tuesday and Wednesday. The Pacific Northwest is experiencing an atmospheric river phenomenon that has been swelling to unprecedented levels. Forecasters predict an additional 4 to 8 inches of rain may fall by midweek.\nIn response to the unfolding disaster, Governor Bob Ferguson has declared a statewide emergency. “The situation is fluid and changing all the time,” Ferguson stated on X. He noted that rivers could reach historic peak levels as early as 4 a.m. tomorrow, with the flooding expected to persist into Friday morning.\nParticularly hard-hit is Skagit County, where authorities have issued evacuation orders for the communities of Hamilton, Rockport, and Marblemount. Mount Vernon, the county’s largest city with a population of around 35,000, is preparing for the worst as the Skagit River is projected to rise to record heights.\nAlong Interstate 5, which connects Seattle and Portland, firefighters have been actively rescuing individuals who attempted to drive through flooded areas, including a semi-truck driver. US-12, a major east-west highway, is submerged in various locations, leaving the small town of Randle isolated.\nIn an effort to mitigate the effects of the flooding, a wall constructed in 2018 in Vermont City has succeeded in protecting parts of downtown from rising waters. Additionally, evacuations have been ordered for a mobile home park along the Snohomish River and temporary flood control barriers have been installed in Auburn, south of Seattle.\n“We’re preparing for what increasingly appears to be a worst-case scenario here,” Mount Vernon Mayor Peter Donovan emphasized. Washington Senator Maria Cantwell has also urged residents to remain vigilant and adhere to evacuation orders, emphasizing that this storm is not a typical weather event.",
