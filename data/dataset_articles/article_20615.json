  "text": "BJD MP Manas Ranjan Mangaraj has called to relocate Parliament sessions out of Delhi during peak pollution months, citing severe air quality issues. He compares Delhi's air crisis to Odisha's disaster management and urges the government to protect lives by holding sessions in cleaner cities. BJD Rajya Sabha MP Manas Ranjan Mangaraj has urged the government to relocate Parliament's Winter and Budget sessions away from Delhi until air quality improves, describing the capital's pollution as a 'man-made disaster'. Addressing the issue during Zero Hour, the Odisha-based MP drew comparisons between his state's efficient disaster response and the pressing need for proactive measures against Delhi's air pollution. Highlighting the risks faced by members and staff due to toxic air, Mangaraj suggested cities with better air quality and infrastructure, emphasizing that the proposal centers on health and safety over politics.",
