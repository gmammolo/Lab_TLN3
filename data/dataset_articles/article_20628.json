  "text": "16 minutes ago A group of Washington state congressional representatives is seeking information from BP after a leak in the Olympic Pipeline in November 2025. The leak occurred in Snohomish County and released about 2,300 gallons of fuel into local waterways and soil. The spill caused a nearly two-week disruption in fuel delivery to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which led to flight delays and operational issues.\nRepresentative Emily Randall (WA-06) led the delegation, which included Reps. Suzan DelBene, Rick Larsen, Kim Schrier, Marilyn Strickland, Adam Smith, Pramila Jayapal, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. They sent a letter to BP North America CEO Murray Auchincloss. The lawmakers said they were relieved the pipeline is now working but raised concerns about risks to public health, farmland, water, and wildlife. They also noted the Olympic Pipeline has had several spills and ruptures in past decades.\nBP has agreed to update the lawmakers on the incident and its effects. The representatives asked for written answers by January 8, 2026. Their questions include the exact amount of fuel leaked, steps taken to assess and fix environmental damage, public disclosure plans, and a list of past spills since 2005. They also asked about measures to prevent future leaks and BP’s work with state agencies.\nThe letter mentioned a $3.8 million fine BP received for a previous leak in December 2023 near Conway, WA. Lawmakers asked what changes BP has made to its monitoring and maintenance since then. They also want to know if there is any link between the 2023 and 2025 incidents, and if BP will work on emergency planning for future fuel supply issues.\nThe lawmakers pointed out that there have been at least three major pipeline incidents since 2023. They called for transparency and accountability. They said it is important to keep the Olympic Pipeline safe and reliable for the Pacific Northwest and urged BP to work with state and local officials to protect residents and the environment.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
