  "text": "A tiger was killed by a train at the Ratapani Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, marking the second such death in a week. The region faces ongoing threats from railway tracks, which have led to numerous wildlife fatalities over the past decade. A heart-wrenching incident unfolded at the Ratapani Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh's Raisen district when a tiger was killed by a train. The tragic event occurred during the night between Budhni and Midghat, an area already notorious for posing threats to wildlife. This incident marks the second tiger fatality in the area within a week and the fifth in the reserve over the past year. Alarmingly, the Budhni-Midghat railway track continues to pose significant dangers to local wildlife. Divisional Forest Officer Hemant Raikwar reported the tiger was dragged for 25 feet after being hit. The forest department is increasingly concerned as railway tracks have claimed the lives of numerous animals in the past decade. (With inputs from agencies.)",
