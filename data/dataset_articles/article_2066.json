  "text": "TN lineman laid to rest after being hit, killed by alleged drunk driver in Alabama\nThomas Ferrell was repairing downed powerlines at an intersection when he was hit and killed by an alleged drunk driver.\nGOODLETTSVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - A Tennessee lineman has been laid to rest after he was killed by an alleged drunk driver while he was on the job in Alabama.\nIn March, 49-year-old Thomas Ferrell, of White House, went to Talladega County, Alabama, to help repair a powerline damaged by a tornado.\nAccording to WSMV sister station WBRC, Ferrell was repairing powerlines in the Ashland Highway/Mount Olive Circle and Mountain View Road intersection when the crash happened.\nWBRC reports that Ferrell was walking across Ashland Highway, while wearing a fluorescent green safety jacket, when he was hit by a pickup truck driven by Miguel Manzana-Martinez, 45, of Talladega. Police say Manzana-Martinez was believed to have been drunk when the crash happened.\nOn Wednesday, WSMV spoke with Ferrell’s son outside his visitation, who said he remembers his dad for his dedication to helping others – which is what he was doing when he passed.\n“He cared for everybody. He loved working. That’s what he loved doing. He loved chasing storms. He would get on a job in a heartbeat if he had to,” Drew Ferrell said.\nManzana-Martinez is still in jail in Talladega County and has been charged with manslaughter, first-degree assault and driving under the influence. He is being held on a $50,000 cash bond in the Talladega County Jail.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
