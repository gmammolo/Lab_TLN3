(WITN) - A call for a domestic dispute leads to drug and gun charges against a Plymouth man.\nDeputies in Washington County say they went to a domestic violence call at 119 Locust Lane in Plymouth on Tuesday morning.\nDeputies say 43-year-old Tony Webb was arrested after an alleged domestic situation involving his son and a gun.\nAccording to deputies, Webb had two outstanding warrants out of Martin County for possession of a firearm by a felon and identity theft.\nAfter a search of the home, deputies say they found over 2 lbs. of marijuana, 1 gram of crack cocaine, scales, packaging materials, a stolen 9mm Glock handgun and a .40 caliber Ruger handgun.\nHe was taken to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office and put under a $250,000 secured bond.\nCopyright 2025 WITN.
