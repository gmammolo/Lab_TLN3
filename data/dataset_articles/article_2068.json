  "text": "Man killed in deputy-involved shooting at Elizabeth City hospital identified\nELIZABETH CITY, N.C. (WITN) - The man killed in a deputy-involved shooting Tuesday morning in Elizabeth City has been identified.\nThe Pasquotank County Sheriff’s the suspect has been identified as 51-year-old Michael Clarke.\nDeputies say they and Elizabeth City police officers were called to the Sentara Albemarle Medical Center emergency room around 1:15 Tuesday morning after getting reports of a man armed with a gun.\nThe State Bureau of Investigation says he was a patient at the hospital.\nLaw enforcement found the man holding a gun in the ER triage room when they got to the hospital.\nAccording to deputies, Clarke pointed the gun at law enforcement, who then exchanged gunfire with the suspect.\nThe Elizabeth City man was hit by gunfire.\nOfficials say it took 15 to 20 seconds for deputies to enter the hospital, confront the armed suspect and fatally shoot him. It’s something they say was quick but unfortunate.\n“While it was great no officer, deputy, or hospital official was injured, loss of life is never something that we want,” Pasquotank County Sheriff Tommy Wooten said.\nClarke received medical attention immediately, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n“We are a safe place to give and receive care, and I’d like to say this incident is unusual in our community and in our nation, but it’s not,” said Teresa Watson, hospital president. “This is just one of many unfortunate shootings that take place and as a hospital we really struggle to provide a welcoming, calm environment.”\nDeputies say before they got there, the suspect entered the ER and pointed the gun at multiple ER personnel.\nAn unarmed security guard with Sentara tried to stop the suspect while waiting for authorities to arrive.\nAccording to deputies, the security guard, who’s a Navy veteran and former New York City police officer, was injured after Clarke assaulted them, causing the guard to need surgery. Watson is hailing him as a hero.\n“It could have been a much worse outcome,” Watson said.\nNo members of law enforcement were hurt.\nThe hospital said that even though a nurse was held hostage by the man, that nurse elected to stay at the hospital and finish her shift after the shooting.\n“And this is a hospital, right? Where you come for respite, for care, for reassurance,” said Watson. “And we’re yet met with the violence that takes place by having a gun pulled on you and being held hostage, if you will.”\nWatson said in the next few weeks, the medical center will install a weapons detection system to stop something like this from happening again.\n“I would love not to have a weapon detection system in a place that you’re offering care but that’s just not the world we live in,” Watson said.\nSheriff Wooten said the three deputies who shot Clarke are currently on administrative leave with pay pending investigation.\nThe SBI is investigating the deputy-involved shooting.\nCopyright 2025 WITN.
