  "text": "After months of US strikes on accused drug boats and a build up of military power in the region, Venezuela has accused the US of \"piracy\" after an oil tanker was seized by American troops off the country’s coast.\nThe US attorney general says the sanctioned tanker was part of \"an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\" but the Venezuelan government said the operation \"constitutes a blatant theft\".\n#donaldtrump #unitedstates #venezuela #skynews\nSUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel for more videos: http://www.youtube.com/skynews\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/skynews\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/skynews\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/skynews\nFollow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@skynews\nFor more content go to http://news.sky.com and download our apps: Apple https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sky-news/id316391924?mt=8 Android https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bskyb.skynews.android&hl=en_GB\nSky News Daily podcast is available for free here: https://podfollow.com/skynewsdaily/\nTo enquire about licensing Sky News content, you can find more information here: https://news.sky.com/info/library-sales",
