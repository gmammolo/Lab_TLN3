  "text": "PORTSMOUTH, Va. — A Portsmouth man was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in federal prison for trafficking fentanyl. This sentence is not his first drug trafficking conviction. According to court documents, Karleak Ali, 53, sold fentanyl and cocaine to undercover Chesapeake Police officers during five controlled buys between February and May 2023. On May 25, 2023, officers from Chesapeake Police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) executed a search warrant at Ali’s residence and vehicle, seizing 33 grams of fentanyl, 87 grams of cocaine, packaging materials, drug paraphernalia, two firearms, ammunition, and approximately $6,000. Ali has prior felony drug convictions in Norfolk Circuit Court for cocaine distribution. He was also convicted in federal court in 2007 for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine.",
