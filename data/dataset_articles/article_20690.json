  "text": "Wild sheep fans have pitched in to swell the reward for information about a poached bighorn ram near Riggins to nearly $13,000.\nThe Idaho Department of Fish and Game is investigating the shooting of a young bighorn ram along the Big Salmon Road east of Riggins. Conservation offices believe the animal was shot between Nov. 20 and 22 near Partridge Creek.\nThe Idaho Wild Sheep Foundation and Citizens Against Poaching initially offered a reward of $2,700 for information that leads to a citation or arrest in the case. The reward is now at $12,800.\nIdaho Wild Sheep Foundation vice president Rich Carignan, of Lewiston, said people have been eager to donate to the effort and he expects the reward will continue to grow.\n“It’s from our passionate members at the Idaho Wild Sheep Foundation and from private citizens stepping up. They love the bighorn sheep — they are iconic,” he said. “They want to catch the people who did this. Wasting of this ram is unacceptable.”\nThe ram was shot in the face during a time when there was no open hunting season on the animals. Bighorn sheep are classified as a trophy animal in Idaho and hunters must compete in lotteries to win a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pursue them.\nIllegally shooting a bighorn ram is a felony under Idaho code that carries a fine up to $10,000.\nThe department is asking anyone with information about the incident to call the Citizens Against Poaching hotline at (800) 632-5999 or the Fish and Game Clearwater Regional Office at (208) 799-5010.\nBarker may be contacted at ebarker@lmtribune.com or at (208) 848-2273.
