  "text": "The Kampong Speu provincial administration has reported a decline in fisheries resources, attributing the decrease to a possible rise in the use of illegal fishing equipment.\nIn the “Measures to Prevent the Destruction of Natural Fishery Resources and the Ban on Illegal Fishing Gear” announcement, released on December 10, provincial governor Cheam Chansophorn stated that the administration has observed declining fishery yields in natural water bodies like dams, lakes, streams, reservoirs, ponds, rice fields and canals.\nThe announcement noted that the decline “may be caused by the use of illegal fishing gear”.\nTo sustain natural fishery stocks for food security and daily livelihoods, the administration has implemented several legal measures, including bans on the use of electric shock fishing equipment, small-mesh nets, explosive devices and poisons, as well as newly invented or modified fishing tools that damage fishery resources or ecosystems.\nAdditional banned equipment includes spear-fishing tools fitted with flashlight devices in fish breeding zones, as well as large-mesh nets over 15 cm.\nThe administration also prohibits activities that destroy fishery resources or damage the environment and ecosystems, including the production, purchase, sale, transport or storage of electric shock gear and small-mesh nets. It further bans dumping or releasing solid waste, liquid waste or toxic substances into fishery conservation zones.\nChansophorn appealed to all relevant authorities and fishing communities to cooperate with provincial fisheries authorities to take action against individuals who continue to violate the fishery law.\nDuring the current dry-season period, officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries have been carrying out enforcement operations, cracking down on fishery crimes and destroying numerous types of illegal fishing gear.\nIn the past two days, Tim Borak, undersecretary of State at the ministry, led enforcement teams on patrol in Prey Chhor district of Kampong Cham province and Krouch Chhmar district of Tbong Khmum. The teams discovered multiple violations and destroyed 550 metres of small-mesh nets and 290 bamboo stakes used for illegal fishing. Dozens of kilogrammes of confiscated fish were released back into the water.",
