  "text": "Hats off to Sen. Bernie Sanders-supported efforts to nix a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s plan to kill as many as 500,000 barred owls in California, Oregon and Washington in a vain attempt to reduce competition with the rarer Northern spotted owls (NSOs).\nBut demerits to Sen. Peter Welch who voted to kill North American forest owls who have been federally protected for over a century under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.",
