  "text": "Kennedy Peretei, the publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo state, has resigned his membership of the party.\nIn a letter dated April 9 and addressed to the Arogbo ward 1 PDP chairman in Ese-Odo LGA of Ondo, Peretei claimed that the party leadership in the state is not interested in winning elections.\nPeretei said, “it is difficult to work with persons whose interest is to use the party to trade every election cycle.”\nHe added that PDP in Ondo is “currently leaving the intensive care unit for the morgue.”\nAdvertisement\n“I wish to inform you about my decision to quit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as those who claim to be at the leadership of the party have no intention to win any elections, now or in the future,” the letter reads.\n“It is difficult to work with people whose interests are only themselves and how they can use the party to trade every election year.\n“I was privileged to serve as the State Financial Secretary of the PDP at its infancy (1999-2003) and served again as State Publicity Secretary, 2020 to date.\nAdvertisement\n“I contributed my quota at every level. But the same people who have held the party hostage, making it impossible to win elections in the last three election cycles have tightened their grip on a party that laid prostrate at the intensive care unit. The PDP in Ondo State is now on its way to the morgue.\n“For those who depend on election funds and party patronage to run their families, I admonish them to seek second addresses, so that, they can live more meaningful lives than that of political bandits, Almajaris or just Yes men.”",
