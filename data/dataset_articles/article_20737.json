  "text": "Tens of thousands of residents in western Washington could face evacuation orders when another round of heavy rain drops on the region on Thursday, threatening to bring catastrophic flooding as rivers near historic levels.\nDays of seemingly unrelenting heavy rain had already triggered rescues and road closures, and by Wednesday, Gov. Bob Ferguson declared a statewide emergency, warning that \"lives will be at stake in the coming days.”\nSome residents have already been ordered to higher ground, with Skagit County, a major agricultural region north of Seattle, ordering those within the Skagit River’s floodplain to evacuate.\n“Catastrophic flooding is likely” in many areas and the state is requesting water rescue teams and boats, Ferguson said on the social media platform X on Wednesday night. Hundreds of Guard members will be sent to help communities, said Gent Welsh, adjutant general of the Washington National Guard.\nIn a valley leading out to the foothills of Mount Rainier southeast of Seattle, Pierce County sheriff’s deputies on Wednesday rescued people at an RV park in Orting, including helping one man in a Santa hat wade through waist-deep water.\nPart of the town was ordered to evacuate over concerns about the Puyallup River’s extremely high levels and upstream levees.\nA landslide blocked part of Interstate 90 east of Seattle, with photos from Eastside Fire & Rescue showing vehicles trapped by tree trunks, branches, mud and standing water. Officials also closed a mountainous section of US 2 due to rocks, trees and mud.\nMore than 17,000 customers in Washington had lost electricity by Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.us.\nRelatedTRT World - Texas flood death toll rises to 119 as search and criticism continue\nFlooding rivers could break records\nThe Skagit River is expected to crest at roughly 14.3 metres (47 feet) in the mountain town of Concrete early Thursday, and roughly 12 metres (41 feet) in Mount Vernon early on Friday.\n“We feel very confident that we can handle a ‘normal flood,’ but no one really knows what a 41, 42 foot (12 metre) river looks like south of Mount Vernon,\" Darrin Morrison, a commissioner for Dike District 3 in Skagit County, said during a public meeting on Wednesday night.\nThe county was closing non-essential government services on Thursday, including all district and superior court services.\nFlooding from the river has long plagued Mount Vernon, the largest city in the county with some 35,000 residents. Flooding in 2003 displaced hundreds of people.\nThe city completed a floodwall in 2018 that helps protect the downtown. It passed a major test in 2021, when the river crested near record levels.\nBut the city is on high alert. The historic river levels expected Friday could top the wall, and some are worried that older levees could fail.\n“It could potentially be catastrophic,” said Ellen Gamson, executive director of the Mount Vernon Downtown Association.\nJake Lambly added sandbags, tested water pumps and moved valuables to the top floor of the home he shares with his 19-year-old son.\n“This is my only asset,” he said Wednesday from his front porch. “I got nothing else.”\nRelatedTRT World - US climate-disaster database, once scrapped by Trump, reveals record $101B losses up to mid-2025",
