  "text": "A fast-moving bushfire has prompted an emergency evacuation order in parts of Perth's south-eastern suburbs, threatening lives and homes amid rising temperatures. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) issued the warning around 12:50 PM on Thursday, December 11, 2025, as the blaze rapidly advanced eastward. Firefighters, supported by water bombers, are actively battling the out-of-control fire reported just after 12:10 PM.Affected areas and evacuation detailsThe emergency warning covers regions bounded by Welshpool Road East, Tonkin Highway, Kenwick Road, Brixton Street, and Roe Highway, impacting parts of Kenwick, Wattle Grove, Maddington, and Beckenham in the Cities of Canning, Gosnells, and Kalamunda. Homes along Bickley Road face direct threat from the flames, with residents urged to evacuate immediately southward toward Albany Highway. You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes, stated a DFES spokesperson, emphasizing that delaying departure could endanger lives.Local roads such as Wanaping Road and Bickley Road have been closed, and motorists are advised to avoid the area, reduce speed, and drive carefully due to traffic disruptions on Roe Highway and Tonkin Highway. The fire's proximity to the Kenwick Wetlands Nature Reserve adds environmental concerns, while midday temperatures in Perth reached 30 degrees Celsius, heightening fire danger ratings.Multiple fire crews and aerial resources are on the scene, with aerial water bombers assisting ground efforts to contain the easterly-spreading blaze. This incident aligns with an elevated bushfire risk outlook for Western Australia in 2025, driven by dry conditions, high fuel loads, and increasing ignition potential, as noted in seasonal forecasts. No fatalities or property losses have been reported yet, but the situation remains dynamic.FAQs What if evacuation routes are blocked?Prioritize leaving via clear paths toward Albany Highway; if blocked, shelter in place with a bushfire survival plan, sealing your home and staying low to avoid smoke.When can residents return home?Return only when DFES downgrades the warning to watch and act or all clear ; monitor official apps or emergency.wa.gov.au for real-time updates.",
