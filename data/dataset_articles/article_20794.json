  "text": "Environment Ministry seals West Sumatra mining sites due to flooding December 11, 2025 15:22 GMT+700\nAerial view of the mining area that was sealed by the Environment Ministry (KLH). ANTARA/HO-KLH Jakarta (ANTARA) - The Environment Ministry (KLH) has temporarily sealed and installed monitoring boards at several mining sites in West Sumatra in response to flooding in the region.\nThe Environment Minister, Hanif Faisol Nurofiq, in Jakarta on Thursday, stated that the measure aims to temporarily halt operations that could worsen hydrological conditions, ensure compliance with environmental obligations, and protect the safety of affected residents.\n\"Environmental compliance is not just a formality; it is a matter of public safety and regional carrying capacity. We will not hesitate to enforce regulations to protect the community,\" Nurofiq said.\nHe stated that the sealing was conducted after the KLH monitoring team performed field verification and discovered mining openings that had not been reclaimed, along with a lack of monitoring of runoff and potential landslides.\nThe conditions are suspected of exacerbating erosion and mudflows that have inundated downstream settlements. Field findings indicated that several cleared areas lacked valid environmental approval documents.\nThe monitoring team requested official information from the companies involved, reviewed the Environmental Impact Assessment (Amdal) documents or environmental permits, and assessed the implementation of erosion control, drainage, and post-mining reclamation measures.\nThe sealing is temporary and will be lifted if the company can demonstrate compliance with environmental obligations and an adequate remediation plan.\nKLH stated that the action is part of transparent and accountable environmental law enforcement efforts.\nIn addition to the sealing, the ministry instructed the installation of public monitoring signs to inform the public about the location's status and the government's steps to prevent long-term impacts.\nThe inspection process will involve a technical assessment of former mine management, monitoring the quality and quantity of water flow, and verifying the reclamation plan.\nIf administrative or technical violations are found, the KLH will proceed with the sanctioning process in accordance with statutory regulations, including administrative action and law enforcement recommendations.\nKLH also urged local governments, law enforcement officials, and the public to coordinate recovery efforts, clearing materials obstructing river flows, and reorganizing vulnerable areas.\nThe ministry emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring to ensure that mining practices do not compromise the function of protected areas, water management, and public safety.\nRelated news: Gov't vows to take firm action against Halimun illegal mine\nRelated news: Freeport mine tragedy: All 7 missing workers found dead in Papua\nTranslator: Prisca Triferna Violleta, Cindy Frishanti Octavia\nEditor: Arie Novarina\nCopyright © ANTARA 2025",
