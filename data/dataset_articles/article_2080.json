  "text": "Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown on Wednesday announced that 11 people were charged in connection with a drug trafficking organization in Curtis Bay.\nThe operation resulted in the seizure of nine handguns and three Glock switches.\nSpeaking with WBAL Radio’s C4 and Nehman on Thursday, Scott stressed the danger the devices pose, adding, “People don’t have Glock switches just to protect their house or protect their family. You’re looking to inflict a lot of harm to a lot of people in a short amount of time.”\nClick here to watch Mayor Scott’s interview with C4 and Nehman.\nCharges in the indictments include illegal possession of firearms and distribution of fentanyl.\nThe near-year long investigation was led by the Organized Crime Unit of the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, the Group Violence Unit of the Baltimore Police Department, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement as part of the city’s Group Violence Reduction Strategy.\n“This takedown is a great example of how GVRS is working to make our communities in South Baltimore safer as we prepare for full expansion to the Southern District. We want Baltimoreans to remain safe, alive, and free,” Scott said.\nIn his conversation with C4 and Nehman, Scott noted that connections between violence in other neighborhoods and the southern district, where Curtis Bay is located, led to this operation.\nHe applauded the coordinated efforts of GVRS, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD), and other stakeholders, while reiterating the city’s focus on giving offenders a chance to change before facing legal consequences. “We want to give people the opportunity to change their life, right… But if they ignore the mandate to put down the guns, that is what was going to happen to those folks,” Scott said.\n“You can see that communication, how the teams are working together, the partnership in this case.” the mayor remarked.\nThe investigation revealed that the individuals would distribute fentanyl and cocaine to customers. The suspects would store drugs and firearms in and around abandoned properties.\n“The drug trade — violently protected by illegal guns — poisons communities by stealing children’s futures and threatening people’s safety,” Brown said. “With these charges, our Office and its partners are sending a clear message that those who profit off the disease of addiction and add to the devastation of the fentanyl epidemic will be prosecuted for the harm they have inflicted on their neighbors.”\nThe individuals charged can be found below:\nColby Brown, 22, of Baltimore City\nRashad Bryant, 22, of Baltimore City\nTerry Cheeks, 20, of Baltimore City\nAndrew Clemons, Jr., 20, of Baltimore City\nDarico Cummings, 29, of Baltimore City\nRayquan Ford, 23, of Baltimore City\nDorrell Gross, 49, of Baltimore City\nKairie Harrison, 23, of Baltimore City\nMarkel Hawkins, 23, of Baltimore City\nJaquan McCain, 20, of Baltimore City\nDenise Smith, 40, of Baltimore City\nBrown, Ford, Harrison and Hawkins are the only individuals who have not been apprehended by police. Anyone with information on their whereabouts are asked to call Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-756-2587.\n11 people charged, of which 4 are still at large. They’re connected to a drug ring “terrorizing” South Baltimore. We are on @wbaltv11 with what else we’ve learned about what was an open air drug market. pic.twitter.com/Ern07W8njW\n— Tommie Clark (@TommieClarkWBAL) April 9, 2025",
