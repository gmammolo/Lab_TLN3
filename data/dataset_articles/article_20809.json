  "text": "Russian woman clears litter in Uttarakhand, calls out 'upsetting sight' in video\nA Russian woman ended up clearing litter during her trek in Uttarakhand. A video of her plea to keep the environment clean has gone viral.\nA Russian woman’s concerning message from her trek in Uttarakhand’s Chandrashila has gone viral after she urged tourists to respect India’s natural beauty by not littering.\nIn an Instagram post, user @tanya_in_india documented her journey through Chopta, Tungnath, and Chandrashila. She described the trek as “almost too beautiful” and admitted she was exhausted for most of it, but the scenic beauty, she said, was worth every step.\nThe sunrise at Chandrashila, however, left her disappointed. As the light spread across the ridge, Tanya spotted heaps of trash scattered along the trail and even at the sacred peak, a place revered by pilgrims and nature lovers alike.\n“It was a really upsetting sight,” she said in the caption of the post.\nWatch the video here:\nWith only one bag, Tanya and her friends picked up all the waste they could find and carried it down the mountain to dispose of it properly.\nHer post concluded with a simple plea: “Please don’t leave trash in the mountains. Respect the place you come to. And if you have the strength to help and clean it, it’s a good deed.”\nThe video went viral, prompting an outpouring of comments from users across India.\nOne user wrote, “Thank you for respecting our mountains more than many of us do.”\nAnother commented, “Wish all tourists behaved like this. So much to learn.”\nMany also shared their own experiences of witnessing littering on popular Himalayan trails.\nTanya’s post has now become a small but powerful reminder of how preserving the mountains is everyone’s responsibility.\nA Russian woman’s concerning message from her trek in Uttarakhand’s Chandrashila has gone viral after she urged tourists to respect India’s natural beauty by not littering.\nIn an Instagram post, user @tanya_in_india documented her journey through Chopta, Tungnath, and Chandrashila.
