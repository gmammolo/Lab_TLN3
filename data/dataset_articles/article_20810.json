  "text": "Forest Dept Shooter Kills 'Man-Eating' Leopard In Uttarakhand Village\nThe leopard was killed by shooter Joy Hukil and team giving a sigh of relief to villagers of Gajald who had been living in fear.\nPublished : December 11, 2025 at 1:59 PM IST\nPauri: Locals at Gajald village here on Wednesday heaved a sigh of relief after a shooter hired by the Forest Department shot dead a 'man-eating' leopard.\nPauri Forest Divisional Officer, Abhimanyu Singh confirmed that the female leopard around five years old, was killed by shooter Joy Hukil and his team on Wednesday night. The killed leopard is the same captured in the trap cameras installed in the area, Singh said. The leopard's carcass was later transported to the Nagdev Forest Range in Pauri for further proceedings. Singh said that a DNA sample of the killed leopard will be taken and tested to ascertain if it was the same leopard.\nVillagers had been living under fear due to the terror caused by the leopard. Last Thursday, a 45-year-old man, Rajendra Nautiyal, was attacked and killed by a leopard at the village. Since then, leopard activity has been continuously observed in the area. On Wednesday, a leopard attacked a woman in the Chaubattakhal area leaving her grievously injured. Several domestic animals were also attacked by the big cat, causing widespread anger among the villagers. The villagers demanded that, in addition to the departmental shooters, a private shooter be immediately deployed to eliminate the man-eating leopard.\nAmid the outrage, Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had directed the Forest Department to take action in this regard. The department hired the shooter and neutralised the big cat in a coordinated effort.\nFollowing the twin attacks in the area, a team of senior officials led by Principal Secretary (Forest) R K Sudhanshu had visited the spot and met the affected villagers.
