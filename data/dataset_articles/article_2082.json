  "text": "GARY, Ind. (WISH) — A police officer in Gary fatally shot a man during an armed hostage situation, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Department in a Wednesday news release. At 9 p.m. Tuesday, Lake County deputies responded to an apartment in the 2200 block of Carolina Street to assist Gary Police Department officers with securing a perimeter around the building. An armed man inside the apartment had reportedly held at least two people hostage: A 35-year-old male relative and a 1-year-old boy. Shots were fired inside the apartment and the relative suffered a minor injury. The relative was able to run from the apartment and refused medical treatment at the scene. The suspect refused to leave the apartment and fired multiple rounds at police during the incident. The Gary Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team requested the use of a Lake County Sheriff’s Department specialized tactical armored vehicle in an attempt to safely position officers closer to the scene. The department deployed the armored unit with four SWAT officers. The Lake County Sheriff’s Department Drone team provided real-time aerial surveillance. A ramming tool on the armored unit was used to breach the back door to the apartment, removing it. SWAT officers deployed tear gas inside the apartment, but the suspect refused to come out. He was seen approaching the front door several times with a gun in one hand and the boy in the other. Sometime around 4:20 a.m. Wednesday, the suspect walked out of the back door toward his vehicle holding the boy and pointing a gun at police. At that time, a Gary officer opened fire and the suspect was wounded. The suspect was later pronounced dead. The boy was not harmed. Investigators identified the suspect as a 38-year-old man, but they did not immediately provide his name. Lake County Crime Scene Investigation collected evidence at the scene. The investigation of this incident is ongoing.",
