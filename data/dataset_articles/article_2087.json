  "text": "Flatbush students face debt at LIU\nFLATBUSH — THE ROC NATION SCHOOL of Music at Long Island University, a performing arts program backed by rap mogul Jay-Z, allegedly made students offers of graduating “without debt” – but LIU says many now owe thousands, frustrated alumni told Gothamist.\nLaunched in 2021, the program offered elite facilities, celebrity instructors and full-tuition scholarships. Students showed Gothamist letters claiming they would be able to graduate “without debt.” In at least one case, a student alleged that LIU’s president, Kimberly Kline, reached out to her via text after graduating high school to make the debt-free offer.\nStudents in the first-year class, who entered in 2021, say they were then blindsided by fees for housing, insurance and other expenses, currently set at $22,000 a year, and are struggling to repay these costs, with some having dropped out over the burden. Gothamist found that in 2023, the university changed language on its website from “debt-free” to “tuition-free,” which the school now argues is a distinction its students should have understood.\nStudents also said the promised facilities did not exist, with some freshmen having to construct a DIY recording studio in an empty classroom, and that the celebrity lecturers promised in advertisements never materialized.\n✰✰✰",
