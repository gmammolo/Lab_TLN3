  "text": "A shocking video from near Siliserh Lake in Alwar has gone viral, showing a group of young reelmakers risking their lives for social media content. The clip captures them taking selfies dangerously close to crocodiles resting near a pond. In an even riskier move, one of them attempts to grab a crocodile's tail.\nStartled by the action, the crocodile quickly darts into the water, a moment that could have easily turned into a tragic attack. Forest officials and netizens have expressed concern over the increasing trend of thrill-seeking behaviour around wildlife.\nIn the video, several young boys can be seen roaming around the lake, few in the close parameters of the wild animal. The video going viral was captured by one of the youths who was vlogging near the lake.\nThe video is being widely shared online, with many urging authorities to take action and issue stronger warnings to prevent such reckless interactions with wild animals. There is no official statement from authorities on the incident and the viral video surfacing online.\nCrocodile Sightings in Alwar\nAlwar is famous for its crocodile sightings, primarily at Siliserh Lake, a scenic man-made lake just outside the city, known for its large population of mugger crocodiles that bask on the banks, especially in winter, offering great views and photography opportunities alongside the historic Siliserh Palace. It is being that the lake is home to over 300 crocodiles.\nPhillipines Woman Rescues 2 Pet Dogs Before Escaping Massive Blaze\nA heart-stopping viral video from Mandaue City, Cebu shows a woman risking her life to save her beloved pets during a massive house fire. The woman, from Philippines, has been hailed a hero after she prioritised rescuing her two dogs before escaping the burning building herself. Fire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze.",
