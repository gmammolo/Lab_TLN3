  "text": "Eco-anxiety among younger seafarers is on the rise as crews become increasingly exposed to the realities of climate change, warns COLUMBIA blue.\nToday’s seafarers are more connected than ever before, and constant access to social media means they witness environmental crises in real time. Extreme weather events, reports on global warming, and natural disasters are no longer distant headlines – they are becoming immediate and personal concerns.\nAccording to UNICEF, nearly 60% of young people feel “very” or “extremely” worried about environmental issues. For many crew members, this manifests as eco-anxiety. In multinational teams, where individuals come from regions heavily affected by climate change, these emotional pressures can be even more pronounced.\nCOLUMBIA blue – the global marine services platform that includes COLUMBIA cruise services – is responding proactively. With the support of specialists from Mental Health Support Solutions, part of the OneCare Group wellness platform, the company has implemented dedicated mental-health counselling across its fleets to help seafarers manage eco-anxiety and other wellbeing challenges.\nNorman Schmiedl, CEO, Columbia Blue\nThrough COLUMBIA Cruise Services’ associate membership in the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO), COLUMBIA blue also upholds strict environmental standards to ensure responsible ship operations in highly sensitive and often uncharted Antarctic waters.\n“COLUMBIA blue is 100% committed to preserving and protecting natural resources, preventing pollution, and reducing the ecological footprint of our operations,” said Norman Schmiedl, CEO of COLUMBIA blue. “Our group philosophy is iCare, and we apply it to every single area of our business.”\nThis philosophy is reflected in a wide range of initiatives, including optimized ship scheduling and operations with the use of data and artificial intelligence, a culinary programme designed around limited-impact ingredients, reduction of food waste, and the installation of reverse-osmosis water stations to support reusable bottles onboard. Seafarers are also encouraged to participate directly by contributing creative ideas – such as environmental awareness campaigns or the design of reusable items for daily use.\nSource: COLUMBIA blue (CB)",
