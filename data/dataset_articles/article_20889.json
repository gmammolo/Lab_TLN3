  "text": "Srilanka: Cyclone Ditwah’s Impact on Agriculture, Peasantry and Food Sovereignty\nCyclone Ditwah is the largest and most challenging natural disaster in our nation’s history after Tsunami. In a way it represents far more than a catastrophic weather event. It exposes the deep structural vulnerabilities in Sri Lanka’s agrarian system; vulnerabilities rooted in colonial exploitation, unjust land relations, and the systematic neglect of peasant agriculture.\nThe scale of agricultural destruction is unprecedented. Government data confirms 108,000 hectares of rice paddies completely destroyed, 11,000 hectares of other field crops lost, 6,600 hectares of maize obliterated, and 6,143 hectares of vegetables wiped out entirely. These are not merely statistics they represent the livelihoods, food security, and survival of hundreds of thousands of farming families.\nThe timing magnifies the tragedy.\nCyclone Ditwah struck during the Maha season, Srilanka’s major cultivation period, when approximately 563,950 hectares had been freshly sown by nearly 775,000 peasants. These smallholders had invested their labor, savings, and often borrowed capital into crops at various growth stages. The floodwaters destroyed not just harvests but the accumulated investments and hopes of an entire agricultural cycle.\nEarly reports indicate 273,000 acres of paddy lands affected by floods, with the North Central and Eastern provinces experiencing devastating inundation. Key paddy-producing regions in the Vanni districts and Eastern Province remain submerged, directly threatening national food security. For a nation where rice is the staple food, this devastation strikes at the heart of food sovereignty.\nFood Sovereignty Under Siege\nThe crisis in rice production represents an assault on food sovereignty. The significant reduction in national paddy supply will inevitably increase reliance on expensive rice imports, deepening our dependency on global markets and straining already fragile foreign exchange reserves. This is precisely the outcome we warned against: a food system vulnerable to external shocks because it has been systematically undermined by policies favoring export crops over domestic food production.\nThe impact on other food crops further illustrates this vulnerability.\nThe central highlands, which supply the majority of Sri Lanka’s vegetables, saw 2,613 out of 5,893 hectares of upcountry vegetables fully destroyed, while 3,530 of 8,990 hectares of low country vegetables were lost. Some markets now face shortages of essential vegetables including carrots, leeks, beans, and potatoes, with prices rising sharply. These price increases hit hardest the very communities that produce our food rural households where poverty rates have already doubled to nearly 25% following the recent economic crisis.\nThe tea industry, though less severely damaged than food crops, suffered significant disruption in Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and Kandy. While manufacturing capacity remained largely intact, projected production declines threaten export revenues of $1.29 billion generated in the first ten months of 2025.\nPeasantry in Crisis\nThe human dimension of this disaster reveals the precarious existence of Sri Lanka’s peasantry. The livestock sector suffered extensive losses, with poultry supplies of chicken and eggs severely reduced. Cattle farmers reported devastating losses animals killed in floods or left without grazing as sand submerged grasslands. For small-scale mixed farmers who depend on livestock for nutrition, income, and agricultural labor, these losses compound an already dire situation.\nBeyond crop and animal losses, critical infrastructure destruction threatens long-term agricultural viability. The Department of Agricultural Services recorded destruction of 1,777 tanks, 483 dams, 1,936 canals, and 328 rural roads. Government requests for Rs 15 billion to restore paddy lands and vegetable crops, and Rs 4.8 billion for rehabilitating minor irrigation tanks, indicate the massive scale of infrastructure damage. These water management systems, built over centuries and essential for managing distribution during planting seasons, represent communal agricultural knowledge and practice now severely compromised.\nFor us, the most concerning aspect is the debt burden facing farming communities. Rural indebtedness already affects 38% of rural households according to UNDP data. Many peasants borrowed heavily to finance their Maha season crops borrowing that assumed successful harvests to repay loans. With crops destroyed and equipment damaged, these farming families now face crushing debt without means of repayment. This debt-disaster nexus threatens to push smallholders into distress sales of their land the very process of land alienation.\nThe Malaiyaha Tamil community faces particularly acute vulnerability. They already experience the highest rates of poverty and malnutrition in Sri Lanka. Many line homes were destroyed by landslides.\nStructural Vulnerabilities Exposed\nCyclone Ditwah must be understood within broader contexts of climate vulnerability and historical exploitation. The cyclone formed unusually close to the equator and maintained strength far longer than expected after landfall, with over 350 mm of rain in just 24 hours. While Sri Lanka has experienced at least 16 cyclones since 2000, they were typically mild. Ditwah represents a concerning shift suggesting more devastating storms ahead as climate change intensifies.\nSri Lanka ranks high in the Global Climate Risk Index, yet 81.2% of the population lacks adaptive capacity for disasters. This vulnerability reflects decades of environmental degradation, particularly highland deforestation for colonial-era tea and rubber plantations, which increased susceptibility to landslides and soil erosion.\nThe economic losses estimated at up to $7 billion approximately 7% of national GDP represent a profound setback for a country navigating fragile economic recovery. The government has initiated compensation measures, offering rice and field crop farmers 150,000 rupees per hectare and vegetable farmers 200,000 per hectare. However, the scale of disaster far exceeds immediate government capacity. Building agricultural resilience requires immediate priorities like providing seeds and fertilizer for replanting, repairing irrigation infrastructure, and addressing food security needs, alongside long-term measures including strengthened water management systems, comprehensive disaster preparedness plans, and peasant debt relief.\nThis is not merely a natural disaster but a social and political crisis reflecting consequences of unjust land relations, neglect of peasant agriculture, and failure to prioritize food sovereignty. Genuine recovery requires addressing the structural inequalities that left our peasant communities so vulnerable precisely the comprehensive agrarian reform that we continue to advocate for.\nREPORT BY: MONLAR\nTo address your contribution, contact: monlar@sltnet.lk ; +94 112 870 369",
