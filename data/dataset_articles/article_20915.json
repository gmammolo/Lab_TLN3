  "text": "Listen to this article in summarized format\nDelhi's air pollutionhas not brought any significant relief to the citizens in the last few weeks as air quality continued to remain 'very poor' on Thursday with\nAir Quality Index(AQI) above 300 in many areas. As temperatures in North India have experienced a slight dip, the national capital is gripped by a thin layer of\nsmog.\nTired of too many ads? Remove Ads\nAs per the\nCentral Pollution Control Board(CPCB), AQI in Anand Vihar and Delhi Cantonment areas was recorded at 302 with a thin layer of toxic smog.\nAam Aadmi Party(AAP) MP Sanjay Singh on Wednesday expressed concern on Delhi's air pollution and rising AQI. \"We have all seen that the AQI in Delhi has crossed 800. No one talks bout finding a permanent solution to this. In Punjab, the incidents of\nstubble burninghave reduced. We need to have coordination between Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and the Central government. The national capital, where the Prime Minister, the President,\nMPsand all important people stay, has become the most polluted city in the world...\" he said.\nAfter nine days of experiencing \"very poor\" air quality, the national capital saw a marginal improvement on Tuesday, with the average AQI dropping below 300 and into the \"poor\" category, which has now returned to the 'very poor' category.\nThe national capital witnessed strong winds on Wednesday that brought a slight relief, improving the city's AQI to 259 — in the 'poor' category, marking an improvement compared to the pollution spike experienced last week.\nTired of too many ads? Remove Ads\nAt 4 pm on Wednesday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 259, compared to 282 on Tuesday, 314 on Monday, and 308 on Sunday, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\nAccording to the pollution control body, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered \"good\", 51–100 \"satisfactory\", 101–200 \"moderate\", 201–300 \"poor”, 301–400 \"very poor\" and 401–500 \"severe\".\nMumbai Air Pollution\nThe financial capital of the country woke up to 119 AQI with a layer of haze and 'moderate' air quality.
