  "text": "By DPA ,\nnow\nA major clean-up operation is under way in the German state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin, after at least 200,000 litres of crude oil leaked from a pipeline on Wednesday evening.\nThe state's environment minister, Hanka Mittelstädt, is expected to visit the site near the village of Gramzow on Thursday to assess the damage, her ministry said.\nThe fire brigade said late Wednesday that clean-up operations would continue through the night and into Thursday.\nThe leak in the pipeline, which runs from Rostock to Schwedt, occurred on Wednesday evening during a workplace accident. At least 200,000 litres of crude oil escaped, according to estimates by the fire brigade.\nAccording to the refinery operator PCK, initial findings suggest the incident was caused by preparatory work for a planned safety test on the pipeline. Deliberate interference has been ruled out, it said.\nThe oil shot several metres into the air from a small leak at a pumping station and landed on an agricultural field, the fire brigade said.\nAlexander Trenn, head of the Schwedt fire brigade, told dpa the total amount spilled could be even higher and said the leak had continued for several hours.\nAround 100 firefighters and 25 PCK employees were on site on Wednesday evening.\nSpecial suction vehicles were deployed to collect the large quantity of oil, and crews worked with heavy machinery to contain the spread.\n1",
