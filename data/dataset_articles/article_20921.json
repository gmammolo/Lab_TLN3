  "text": "On Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) escalated his criticism of Big Tech's energy demands, warning that Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ: META ) planned Louisiana data center could consume electricity at a scale that outstrips entire U.S. cities while leaving ordinary taxpayers to shoulder the costs.\nSanders Warns Of Massive Power Use From Big Tech Facilities Sanders took to X to raise alarms about the explosive growth of AI data centers and the strain they may place on the nation's power grid.\nHe said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is constructing a facility in Louisiana that will use three times more electricity than all of New Orleans, adding that the public, not billionaires, will ultimately pay for the surge in energy demand.\n\"Oligarchs want YOU to pay for these data centers with higher water & electric bills. Americans must fight back against billionaires who put profits over people,\" Sanders wrote.",
