  "text": "'What troubles me is... Delhi': Citing toxic air, MP urges Centre to shift Parliament sessions to other city\nGoa, Dehradun, Bhubaneswar, Bengaluru — BJD's Manas Ranjan gives options of cities to protect the health of Rajya Sabha members and staff\nBJD Rajya Sabha member Manas Ranjan Mangaraj on Thursday appealed to the government to relocate Parliament's Winter and Budget sessions out of Delhi until air quality improves, calling the capital's annual pollution crisis a \"man-made disaster\".\nRaising the issue during Zero Hour, Mangaraj, who hails from Odisha, drew parallels between his state's efficient response to natural calamities and the need for similar urgency in addressing Delhi's air pollution.\n\"Coming from Odisha, a state that fights cyclones, floods and natural calamities with unmatched discipline, I know what a crisis looks like. But what troubles me is... Delhi,\" he said.\nThe MP highlighted the daily exposure to toxic air faced by members, parliamentary officers, drivers, sanitation workers, and security personnel who keep the House functioning. \"We cannot ignore their suffering. We cannot pretend this is normal,\" he said, adding that holding crucial parliamentary sessions during peak pollution months puts lives at risk unnecessarily.\nMangaraj suggested several cities with cleaner air and adequate infrastructure as potential alternatives, including Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Gandhinagar, Bengaluru, Goa and Dehradun.\n\"If Odisha can evacuate lakhs of people within hours during a cyclone and save lives with precision, then surely the government of India can relocate two sessions of Parliament to protect the health of its own members and staff,\" he argued.\nEmphasising that his proposal was not politically motivated, Mangaraj said, \"This is not about politics. This is about life and dignity. Parliament must show leadership. Parliament must show that the right to live comes before condemnation.\"\nHe urged the government to initiate structured consultations without delay to explore the feasibility of rotating Parliament sessions to cities with better air quality during the winter months.\nDelhi's air quality typically deteriorates sharply between October and January due to a combination of factors, including stubble burning, vehicular emissions, construction dust, and weather conditions that trap pollutants. The winter session, which includes crucial legislative business and the budget session, coincides with the annual peak pollution period.\nUnlock Exclusive Insights with The Tribune Premium\nTake your experience further with Premium access.\nThought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nAlready a Member?
