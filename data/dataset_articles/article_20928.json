  "text": "Lebanon’s state-run electricity company, Electricité du Liban (EDL), issued the following statement:\nIt was expected that a shipment of gas oil for EDL, supplied through the Ministry of Energy and Water – Directorate General of Oil, would arrive between December 5 and 8, 2025. However, based on the latest information, the delivery has been delayed, and the shipment is now expected to reach Lebanese territorial waters on December 12 at noon.\nThis delay has had a direct and severe impact on EDL’s gas oil reserves, particularly at the Zahrani and Deir Ammar power plants, where stocks have dropped sharply and are nearly depleted. Faced with a situation entirely beyond its control and responsibility, EDL says it has taken precautionary measures to extend electricity production for as long as possible and maintain power to vital facilities such as the airport, the port, water pumping stations, wastewater treatment, and other essential state services, while avoiding a total blackout.\nAs part of these measures, EDL was forced to shut down one production unit at the Zahrani plant after the Wednesday night peak on December 10, in order to preserve the remaining fuel. At Deir Ammar, only one gas unit and half of a steam unit remain in operation.\nThe statement adds that the halted unit at Zahrani will be brought back online as soon as the incoming vessel arrives, unloads its cargo, and normal fuel supply is restored.",
