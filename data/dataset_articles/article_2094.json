  "text": "Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill had police called to his home after a recent domestic dispute, and his wife has filed for divorce. Officers responded to a domestic dispute between Hill, his wife Keeta, and his mother-in-law Alesia Vaccaro, according to a police report obtained by WPLG Local 10 in Miami . Vaccaro claimed Hill was behaving in a way that was “very aggressive and impulsive,” and that she was concerned for her daughter’s safety. Keeta Hill said she and Tyreek had been arguing frequently and had attempted couples therapy unsuccessfully. She told police she had accused Hill of not being involved enough in their daughter’s life, after which Hill allegedly grabbed the baby “without malice” and began walking away. Both Hill and his wife told police that the argument never turned physical. The Sunny Isle Police Department said in a statement Wednesday that the investigation into the incident is already closed, and that no crime was committed. TMZ reported that Keeta Hill filed for divorce on Tuesday , one day after the aforementioned incident. Hill and his wife have had previous issues that became public. In early 2024, Hill filed for divorce, but later dropped the petition and said it was mistakenly filed to begin with . Police had also been called to their home over another domestic dispute around that same time. Hill was cited for speeding last September in a high-profile incident that saw him handcuffed by police while he was driving to a Dolphins game. He just concluded his third season with Miami and has garnered some attention recently for his cryptic social media posts.
