  "text": "Flooding from Storm Byron hasn’t helped Cyprus’ dams\nTorrential rain may have sent floodwaters surging through Nicosia’s Pedieos River and turned the sea red at Agia Triada beach with silt and mud in Paralimni as Storm Byron swept across Cyprus earlier this week, but the island’s dams remain critically depleted.\nAccording to a report by the Phileleftheros news outlet on Thursday, Cyprus’ reservoirs are at just 9.4% capacity – far below the 25.4% at this time last year – as parched ground absorbs most of the rainfall before it can reach storage sites.\n“We’ve covered up to 57% of December’s rainfall based on measurements from two days ago,” Andreas Chrysanthou of the Meteorological Department told Phileleftheros. “The rain gave us 60 millimetres of water from the 105mm allocated for December, reaching 50% of the total hydrological year.”\nDrought conditions remain the central obstacle, said Gianna Oikonomidou of the Water Development Department, “as the soil has not yet saturated.”",
