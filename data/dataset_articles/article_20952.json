  "text": "HANOI: Industrial plants in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi have come under renewed pressure to scale back their operations as authorities respond to a week of heavy and hazardous smog in the city.\nVietnam’s Ministry of Health earlier this week urged power, steel and chemical plants to cut output when the air quality index exceeds 200. The index gauges the volumes of hazardous small particles known as PM2.5 that are in the air.\nThe AQI hit 243 midday on Thursday, putting Hanoi fourth on the list of the world’s most-polluted cities, according to AirVisual, which provides independent global air pollution information via a phone app.\nThe city has topped the list on a number of occasions this week, according to the app, a position it also held in January.\nThe Southeast Asian country, a regional manufacturing hub which is urbanizing rapidly, has been suffering from severe air pollution for years, especially in Hanoi.\n“My eyes are itchy, and there’s always a blanket of smog that blocks my vision,” said Hanoi resident Pham Thu Giang, 30. “I have to wear a mask all the time.”\nThe authorities have identified transportation, industrial production, construction activities and the burning of garbage and agricultural residue as the main sources of air pollution in the city.\n“Gasoline-powered motorbikes are used widely in Hanoi, making them a major source of air pollution,” Le Thanh Thuy, an official of the city’s department of agriculture and environment, told local media on Thursday.\nThe city will impose partial bans on gasoline-powered motorbikes in downtown areas from mid-2026 and will gradually expand the ban thereafter to fossil-fuel-powered cars.\n“The current air conditions are very dangerous for the capital Hanoi,” said 75-year old resident Luong Van Toi. “I feel very tired.”\nIf Hanoi’s AQI is converted into actual PM2.5 concentrations, the pollution this week could be as much as 50 times the 5-microgram/cu m level recommended by the World Health Organization.\nVietnam urges factories to cut output as Hanoi chokes on smog\nShort Url\nhttps://arab.news/nryqv\nVietnam urges factories to cut output as Hanoi chokes on smog\n- The Southeast Asian country has been suffering from severe air pollution for years, especially in Hanoi\nSouth Korea minister resigns amid allegations of Unification Church payments\n- Chun Jae-soo called the claims ‘completely false’ and said he had offered to resign to avoid hurting the work of his ministry and President Lee Jae Myung’s government\nSEOUL: South Korean President Lee Jae Myung accepted the resignation of the Oceans Minister on Thursday after Chun Jae-soo said he was stepping down to focus on disproving claims he received illegal payments from the Unification Church.\nChun called the claims “completely false” and said he had offered to resign to avoid hurting the work of his ministry and Lee’s government.\nLocal media in recent days have quoted unidentified sources as saying that a former Unification Church official told prosecutors about payments to members of parliament from Lee’s Democratic Party including Chun. The reports did not say how much money Chun was alleged to have received.\nChun said this week that he would use all legal means to hold accountable “false reports and malicious distortions.”\nUnification Church leader Han Hak-ja is on trial on charges that she bribed former first lady Kim Keon Hee in return for business favors. Han has denied the allegations.\nChun said it was the “right thing to do” to step down to focus on addressing the allegations, which he said were “absurd” and “absolutely groundless.”\nLee had accepted Chun’s resignation, Lee’s office said on Thursday afternoon.\nLee has called for tough investigations into suspected improper links between religious groups and politicians regardless of party affiliation, without naming specific religious entities.\nKim, the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, is also on trial on corruption charges.\nChun called the claims “completely false” and said he had offered to resign to avoid hurting the work of his ministry and Lee’s government.\nLocal media in recent days have quoted unidentified sources as saying that a former Unification Church official told prosecutors about payments to members of parliament from Lee’s Democratic Party including Chun.
