  "text": "WORLD\nMajor oil leak in Germany as crude shoots from damaged pipeline\nAuthorities in Brandenburg have reported a significant oil spill north of Berlin following a pipeline accident near Gramzow/Zehnebeck.\nEmergency services remain on site as efforts continue to contain the spill. Details on the cause and full extent of the damage are still being assessed, Caliber.Az reports, citing German media.\n\"An accident occurred on the PCK pipeline near Gramzow/Zehnebeck, resulting in a large oil spill,\" a spokesman for Brandenburg's Environment Ministry said. \"Emergency services are on site. No information can be provided at this time about the cause or exact extent of the damage.\"\nThe fire department later estimated that approximately 200,000 liters (about 52,835 gallons) of oil had escaped from the pipeline at a pumping station in Gramzow. For reference, this volume would fill just under one-tenth of an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Alexander Trenn of the Schwedt fire department said the leak reached a pressure of around 20 bar (roughly 290 psi) at its peak, causing a fountain of oil several meters high. Specialist machinery is being used to remove the spilled oil, with clean-up operations expected to continue into December 11 morning. Trenn added that around 100 fire department personnel and 25 company employees were deployed at the scene.\nThe leak occurred near the PCK refinery in Schwedt, close to the Polish border. The facility, one of Germany’s largest, can process 11.5 million metric tons of crude oil annually. It is connected via pipeline to the major Baltic Sea port of Rostock. Local public broadcaster reported that by 19:45 local time (1845 UTC), \"the leak was for the most part plugged, although some oil was still leaking out.\"\nThe area surrounding the refinery is heavily forested and includes several nature reserves and national parks. Gramzow is located slightly northwest of Schwedt, near the northern tip of a large protected area, while the Oder River runs through the region, forming much of the border with Poland.\nAFP cited a PCK spokeswoman stating that \"deliberate external influence\" such as sabotage could already be \"ruled out.\" Authorities are investigating the incident, which appears to have been caused by a technical failure at the pipeline rather than any intentional act.\nBy Vafa Guliyeva",
