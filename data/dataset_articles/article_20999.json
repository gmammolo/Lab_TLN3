  "text": "Ten regional Victorian towns have been told their gas supply will be shut off next year because the gas company, Solstice Energy, says it’s too expensive to deliver.\nAround 1,145 households in places like Marong, Swan Hill and Orbost now have to choose between shifting to bottled LPG or attempting a rapid switch to electric appliances — with limited support.\nEnvironment Victoria has been working on the ground with affected residents and is hearing widespread anger, confusion and anxiety about a transition that’s been thrust upon regional communities.\nThe situation stands in stark contrast to Esperance in WA, where a well-funded, hands-on, customer-centred approach helped households move off gas smoothly and fairly.\nKat Lucas Healey, the senior climate and energy advisor at Environment Victoria, explains why Victoria’s process risks locking vulnerable residents into higher-cost energy options and missing the chance to help people electrify.",
