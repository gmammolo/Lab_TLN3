  "text": "POINT PLEASANT — The Barnegat Bay Partnership recently announced that Point Pleasant Borough is the first municipality in New Jersey to become certified in the Jersey-Friendly Yards [JFY] Stewardship Program. The new program, created through a grant from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection [DEP], guides residents, schools and municipalities in land use practices for a healthy environment and recognizes them as protectors of the Barnegat Bay. In addition to the borough, neighboring Brick Township High School became the first school to be certified in the state. Most of the water pollution found in Barnegat Bay comes from the land areas that drain into it. Participants in JFY use land stewardship practices that protect these waterways and provide valuable habitats for pollinators, birds and other wildlife. Assisted by the Point Pleasant Garden Club, the borough designed and installed a 600-square-foot pollinator garden at the municipal complex. Community volunteers planted over 160 individual plants of 30 different pollinator-friendly species, mostly native to the region. Named “Pollinator Point,” the garden supports the borough’s designation as a Monarch City USA. The native plants at Pollinator Point not only provide habitat for monarch butterflies and other pollinators, they also help to stabilize soil and increase stormwater infiltration. “Participation in the JFY program provided the Pollinator Point committee with resources to share with the community, providing further knowledge of the importance of pollinator-friendly landscaping, as well as protecting the waters that run off our landscapes and into the Barnegat Bay,” explained Garden Club member Heidi Riley.
