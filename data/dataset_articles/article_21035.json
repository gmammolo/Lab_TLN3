  "text": "Applications open to adopt rescued Owego goats METHUEN, Mass. (WBNG) -- Nevin Farm in Methuen, Mass. partnered with the Massachusetts SPCA and has received the goats from an animal cruelty case in Owego from January of this year, and is looking for adopters. At 240 Glenmary Dr. in Owego, [100 farm animals were rescued](https://www.wbng.com/2024/01/18/dead-animals-found-100-others-rescued-owego-property/); 17 of which were goats. The MSPCA was on the scene helping rescue all of those animals. Now, they are helping the goats get back to 100% health and find their forever homes. The Equine & Farm Animal Rescue and Outreach Manager Kaycie McCarthy said there are nine does and eight bucks in this group. All animals are open for adoption but some will take more time than others. ”The goats are such fun pets and companions,” McCarthy said. “They are a little mischievous and my favorite thing about them is that mischievous personality. They love to chew on stuff and sample things. People who own goats buy them playground equipment for their little padox because they love to climb on things.” [These applications are open](https://www.mspca.org/adoption-centers/nevins-farm-adoption-center/) to anyone in any state and McCarthy said maybe they can find themselves back in Owego. McCarthy said if you see something, say something, Even if you’re not sure it’s animal cruelty. She says it’s better to get the right people investigating the situation than let it go on.
