  "text": "Despite rats, Phoenix renter still faces big bill to break lease\nPHOENIX (AZFamily) — When Psalm Johnson moved into an apartment at Biltmore on the Lake in Phoenix, the first night in her new place seemed good. The next day wasn’t.\n“I see things moved out of place. I see crumbs on the ground. It freaks me out. Then I go to open my cupboard where my food was and I hear and see a rat,” she told On Your Side.\nJohnson took photos and videos of food wrappers that were torn apart and dead rats on the ground outside. “I have a compromised immune system, so I can already get sick very easily anyway, and being around rats, anything they’re carrying I can get,” she said.\nJohnson started packing to move out and told management, in writing, about the rats. She says she was encouraged by their initial response.\n“Your lease is broken. Don’t worry about anything. Don’t pay anything. There are no issues,” Johnson recalled management telling her.\nShe quickly found out she did have issues. “They were supposed to give me the first month free, which was in my lease, and then they piled two grand and a half on top of that and they’re charging me $50 a day from not paying,” Johnson said.\nThen she received a $4,400 move-out balance, due almost immediately. “Why not just let me out of the lease? I’m physically sick. I can’t be in that environment,” she said.\nAvenue 5 Residential manages hundreds of properties around the country, including Biltmore on the Lake. For weeks, On Your Side has emailed and called, but they have not responded to any of our questions.\n“All residential leases, whether they say so or not, imply that the place is habitable,” said Ken Volk, who runs Arizona Tenants Advocates.\nAccording to Volk, if there are health and safety problems in an apartment, a five-day notice to the landlord is critical. It needs to be in writing, and certified mail is best. If the problem isn’t fixed, renters have rights under the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.\n“The remedies are to terminate the lease, to take the landlord to court for either injunctive relief, and or suing for monetary damages,” Volk said.\nMake sure you have a paper trail to prove everything. Volk says there’s something else renters can do to protect themselves when they leave a lease because of health and safety issues.\n“Regardless of any circumstances, you demand your security deposit back, because that puts a 14 business day time constraint on the landlord’s right to make a claim,” he suggested.\nRenters also have the right to request to be part of a move-out inspection to help protect the security deposit.\nJohnson is stressed about what’s ahead in her situation. “It’s like being on a tightrope,” she said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen.”\nAccording to the Arizona Department of Housing, there is no state agency that enforces the provisions of the Arizona Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.\n“Because most landlord/tenant relations are private transactions, disputes that arise between landlord and tenants are generally considered private matters,” the agency said on its website. “If you are seeking guidance concerning the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, you may wish to consult an attorney. Public members who are not represented by an attorney may find it helpful to contact free community legal services.”\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
