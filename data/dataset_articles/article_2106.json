  "text": "It’s important to know the qualifications of the person administering injectable fillers. | Getty Images It wasn’t that long ago that if you wanted to try and beat Mother Nature at her own game, your only option was to go under the knife. Today, all that has changed thanks to the easy availability of neurotoxins, fillers and other injectables. More affordable and less invasive than surgery, these products are designed to lift, erase, tighten and plump with minimal downtime, making them an appealing alternative for women of all ages. With the increase in demand for the treatments comes an increase in supply. Medical spas are popping up on every corner, and the competition for customers is real.\nUnfortunately, so is the use of counterfeit products injected by people with little to no medical training. These products can potentially lead to serious health risks and ugly complications in the pursuit of beauty.\n“These counterfeit products are not regulated by the FDA and can contain harmful substances which are not monitored that can lead to severe adverse effects,” says Marta Paul, owner of Nova Aesthetics. There have been several instances recently reported of people being hospitalized due to getting counterfeit injections, unknowingly.”\nJust ask San Antonio resident Rosemary Aleman, who went to an unnamed local business to plump her pout and left with a reaction so severe she was embarrassed to leave her house.\n“This reaction was not only physically uncomfortable but also emotionally distressing, as it impacted my confidence and daily life,” she says of the extreme swelling and disfigurement she experienced in her lips.\nUnbeknownst to Aleman, she had received a counterfeit product.\n“I didn’t realize I had been sold fake products because, at the time, I hadn’t done enough research to identify what was legitimate and what was counterfeit,” she said.\nShe is not alone. The average person is not likely to question the validity of the product, especially if it’s offered at a reduced price. However, cost is often one of the biggest red flags.\n“These products are not cheap, even at wholesale prices,” cautions Paul, who explained that the reason for the high cost is that legitimate products must go through expensive FDA testing to be used in the United States. “If the deal the establishment is offering seems too good to be true, then it is.”\nBeware of deeply discounted injectables. | Getty Images Know Your Product Aside from a heavily discounted price, how can you tell if the product you are purchasing is the real deal? The good news is that you don’t have to be a professional to spot a fake. According to Paul, you simply ask to see it. The information on the product should be written in English, and there should be a visible identification number.\n“Ask to take a picture of the packaging and have them open the product up in front of you,” she advises. “Any FDA approved product will have a lot number on it that can be traced back to that specific vial or syringe.”\nIf the practitioner balks at the request or refuses to show you the product, you might want to take your business elsewhere.\nKnow Your Injector Not all injectors knowingly provide counterfeit products. Some get duped by the manufacturer due to their lack of proper training and knowledge. That’s why it’s important to know the qualifications of the person you are entrusting with your face. Although it’s not a requirement in the state of Texas, Paul recommends that your injector should have a nursing license at the minimum, along with additional specific training in the field.\n“Industry standards and techniques are continually evolving,” she explains. “Your injector should complete continuing education courses and specialized training, including cadaver labs, to enhance their understanding of facial anatomy.”\nShe suggests asking your potential injector the following questions before undergoing any procedure:\n• What are your qualifications and experience?\n• How often do you perform this treatment?\n• Do you have a medical director?\n• What are the risks and side effects associated with this procedure?\n• Do I have a way of contacting you outside of business hours?\n• Do you have a crash cart and written plan for managing complications?\nThese are all things that Aleman, who learned her lesson the hard way, says she wishes she had known before undergoing her lip enhancement.\n“My personal experience with these products as a patient highlighted the need for thorough research and caution,” she said. “Never hesitate to ask questions or seek a second opinion if something feels off.”\nIf you suspect an establishment is injecting these products, contact the Texas medical board, the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, the FDA, the Texas attorney general, or your local law enforcement. If you suspect you have been injected with a fake product, seek medical attention immediately.",
