  "text": "Photography by Eiichi Kano\nKoichi Takada Architects has designed a retail building in Shanghai, China, that’s described as an ‘architectural forest’ of 32 trees.\nPhotography ZY Architectural Photography\nSituated on a site that only four decades ago was densely forested, Solar Trees Marketplace is the first step in returning green to greater Shanghai and mitigating the effects of urban sprawl.\nPhotography by Eiichi Kano\nFrom the outside, the tree-like building is a symbolic gateway to the expansive masterplan that prioritizes pedestrian activity, parkland, and nature in an increasingly urban environment.\nPhotography ZY Architectural Photography\nPhotography ZY Architectural Photography\nThe organic form of Solar Trees Marketplace is intended to merge with a promenade of native Camphor trees, and over time transform the area into an oasis of calm amid the bustling urban landscape.\nPhotography by Eiichi Kano\nInside, the building is operating as an immersive sales and display suite for the adjacent residential masterplan development, which has also been designed by Koichi Takada Architects.\nPhotography ZY Architectural Photography\nPhotography ZY Architectural Photography\nOverhanging greenery has also been included in the design, complementing the nature-inspired building and highlighting the curves.",
