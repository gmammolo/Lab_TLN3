  "text": "2-year-old in critical condition after apparent methamphetamine overdose, Kansas police say; woman charged\nA 2-year-old girl was taken to the hospital in critical condition after ingesting an unknown amount of methamphetamine, according to the Osawatomie, Kansas, Police Department.\nPolice said that they responded to a residence at 520 Pacific Ave. at 11:58 p.m. Tuesday on a report that a 2-year-old was in medical distress. While on their way, officers were told the girl was having a seizure due to ingesting meth.\nWhen they arrived, they found her in critical condition. She was rushed to Children's Mercy Hospital by Miami County EMS.\nA search warrant uncovered marijuana, marijuana paraphernalia and meth paraphernalia at the residence.\nInvestigators learned that the girl's biological mom allegedly did not request medical attention for her child out of fear of getting in trouble. The mom allegedly destroyed evidence regarding the meth overdose, police said. A grandparent alerted police what had happened.\nJacci Marie Hays, 34, was arrested Wednesday, April 9, and faces charges of aggravated child endangerment, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of marijuana and interference with law enforcement by destroying evidence.\n\"As a community, I would ask that you keep the two year old child and the first responders that worked this case in your thoughts and prayers,\" Osawatomie Police Chief David Stuteville said in a news release. \"Cases like these take a toll on everyone involved.\"",
