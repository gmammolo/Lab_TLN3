  "text": "Steel has always been associated with resilience and strength. It’s not surprising that steel buildings are considered to be among the strongest, most reliable, and weather-resistant options. At Armstrong Steel, we offer a wide range of steel structures for every purpose. No matter what you plan to build, you can count on us to provide a custom pre-engineered metal building based on your exact requirements and budget. Why should you build with steel? Steel buildings are a testament to the material's reliability and strength, particularly in industrial construction. Steel's high strength-to-weight ratio allows for the creation of strong and durable structures without the need for excessive weight or bulk, allowing for large-span interiors with minimal or no columns. This flexibility makes steel buildings ideal for various applications, from storing oversized equipment and aircraft to commercial and agricultural uses. They can also be customized with specific features like dedicated workshops, large sliding doors, and lifts. But perhaps the most important reason to build with steel is to benefit from its weather resistance. A steel building can withstand the forces of nature when traditional wood and concrete structures would fail. As such, it becomes a vital investment that can protect other investments and things that matter most to individuals, families, or businesses. Unmatched durability At Armstrong Steel, we pride ourselves on constructing durable, pre-engineered steel buildings. We're committed to continuous design improvement and take the time to craft each connection plate, weld, and component meticulously. This attention to detail ensures the assembly of a high-quality metal building, offering peace of mind and a reliable structure for business or personal use. We have access to the most powerful and unique building systems that are better than traditional construction. In addition, we stand behind the quality of our steel projects with the longest manufacturer warranties in the industry, including a 50-year structural warranty, a 40-year paint warranty, and a 35-year rust-through perforation warranty for the roof. Protection against nature’s fury For those concerned about potential risks such as hurricanes, heavy snowfall, high winds, or earthquakes, it is important to note that steel buildings are designed to withstand these incidents. Our structures are engineered to prevent scenarios where roofs or walls may detach or columns buckle under pressure, shaking, or vibrations. Additionally, our steel roof panels, while inherently low-maintenance, can be enhanced with a galvalume finish—an aluminum compound that serves to inhibit rust, thereby extending the lifespan of the roofing. This commitment to structural resilience and preventative measures contributes to the overall durability and reliability of our steel buildings. Another great thing about steel is it’s non-combustible and fire-resistant. So,In case of fire, steel buildings offer slower flame spread and reduced damage risk. This feature can be especially crucial when using the steel building as a workshop, office, medical facility, place of worship, commercial establishment, or any other public space. Strength-to-weight ratio Steel is lighter than concrete, brick, or wood, but the strength-to-weight ratio of steel buildings is higher. This feature allows them to withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and tornadoes. If you are building in a place prone to those incidents, a steel building is worth considering to minimize disruptions and save money. Additionally, the lighter weight of steel simplifies the transportation and assembly process, reducing overall construction time and labor costs. Furthermore, the reduced weight places less stress on foundations, potentially lowering foundation construction costs and making steel buildings suitable for a variety of soil types. At [Armstrong Steel](https://armstrongsteel.com/), we optimize every piece of steel used. And because we build steel buildings in-house, we avoid residual waste and pass the savings on to our customers. As such, you pay only for the materials involved in your metal building. Steel's ability to endure both environmental elements and the test of time makes it an environmentally friendly choice. A steel building's resilience reduces the need for frequent repairs, renovations, or reconstructions, which often have a negative impact on the environment due to additional resource consumption and waste generation. When you opt for a steel structure— particularly one with a straightforward design that doesn’t require extensive customizations—you benefit from a faster construction process. This rapid assembly not only speeds up the overall timeline but also significantly cuts down on labor and construction costs. It also means less disturbance to the building site. This minimizes the environmental footprint of the construction process, as there’s less need for heavy machinery on-site over extended periods and less disruption to the surrounding area. At Armstrong Steel, we meticulously pre-engineer all components of our steel buildings to ensure they fit together seamlessly. This precision engineering reduces waste material that often results from on-site adjustments and modifications. By ensuring that each part of the building is designed to fit perfectly with the others, we eliminate the need for additional labor to correct misalignments or fitting issues during construction. This approach not only streamlines the building process but also contributes to cost efficiency by reducing unnecessary labor expenses and material wastage, aligning with eco-friendly construction practices.
