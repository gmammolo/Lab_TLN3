  "text": "LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Lake Mead water levels have reached a milestone after rising steadily in 2023. The reservoir [currently sits at](https://mead.uslakes.info/level.asp) 1,076 feet. That's about 28 feet higher than this time last year, when the level was 1,047 feet. The last time the water was this high? Almost three years ago, when the level was 1,073 feet in May 2021. RELATED LINK: [Winter storms help snowpack levels across Colorado River Basin](https://www.ktnv.com/news/winter-storm-helps-snowpack-levels-across-colorado-river-basin) While this is good news, levels are still 150 feet lower than capacity and the lake is only 37% full. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation [announced a water shortage](https://www.ktnv.com/news/drought-crisis/the-first-ever-federal-water-shortage-declaration-for-the-colorado-river) in August 2021 and that's expected to continue. TAKE A LOOK: NASA releases images showing Lake Mead between 2000 and 2022 Experts say it would take several years of [above normal snowpack](https://www.ktnv.com/news/drought-crisis/snowpacks-could-help-the-water-levels-at-lake-mead-visitors-are-unsure) in the Colorado River Basin to see significant improvements to Lake Mead.",
