  "text": "The Renewable Fuels Association today thanked a bipartisan group of 43 lawmakers in both houses of Congress who [sent a letter](https://d35t1syewk4d42.cloudfront.net/file/2658) to the Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group, asking them to meet their March 1 deadline for updates to the GREET model and ensure the updates are based on sound science, current data, and methodologies that properly recognize modern practices in agriculture and biofuel production. “RFA applauds this bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Klobuchar, Thune and Duckworth, and Reps. Craig, Pocan, Johnson and Smith for pushing the Biden administration to ensure the proper implementation of sustainable aviation fuel tax credits,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. \"We thank these lawmakers for urging the administration to utilize the best available science and data when determining eligibility for the SAF tax credit established in the Inflation Reduction Act. A transparent and scientifically sound approach is crucial to stimulating investment in domestic SAF production, fostering innovation and creating American jobs.\" The bicameral letter was led by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), John Thune (R-SD) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Reps. Angie Craig (D-MN), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Dusty Johnson (R-SD) and Adrian Smith R-NE). “Biofuels drive economic growth, create good-paying manufacturing jobs and strengthen economies across rural America,” the lawmakers write. “As you continue to develop a model to determine eligibility, we ask that you take measures to permit every participant in the SAF lifecycle to appropriately participate in the carbon reduction process.”",
