  "text": "The Telegraph has learned that one of the UK's largest police forces has temporarily blocked applications from white British candidates in a bid to boost diversity\nThe Telegraph has learned that one of the UK's largest police forces has temporarily blocked applications from white British candidates in a bid to boost diversity.\nWest Yorkshire Police (WYP) is currently blocking white British candidates from applying to work as recruits in its police constable recruitment programmes. However, \"under-represented\" groups are allowed to apply in advance.\nThe process has raised concerns that white British candidates are being treated unfairly, amounting to a form of positive discrimination that could potentially be illegal.\nWYP has said the policy is aimed at ensuring that its officers represent \"diverse communities\". But former officers have accused it of effectively running a \"hidden\" recruitment policy that targets certain groups.\nOne of the publication's sources claimed that black and Asian candidates from the Far East are considered particularly underrepresented and are given a \"gold\" rating, followed by those from Southeast Asia, who are in the silver tier. \"White others\", including candidates of Irish and Eastern European descent, are given a bronze rating.",
