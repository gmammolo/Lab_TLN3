  "text": "ATR presented the 2023 results for aircraft sales and deliveries. This period highlights solid growth driven by increased deliveries and sales, good performance in support and services, and the addition of new customers.\nIn 2023, ATR delivered a total of 36 aircraft, a 44% increase compared to 2022. The Italo-French manufacturer had to face disruptions in the supply chain, with shortages of raw materials and components slowing down the manufacturer’s ambitious acceleration.\nRegarding sales, 40 firm orders were received, surpassing by 53% the sales achieved in 2022. Eleven new customers have added ATR aircraft to their fleets, both new and second-hand aircraft.\nIn the second-hand market, over 100 transactions were recorded, demonstrating the high demand for ATR turboprops.\nAsia remains ATR’s most dynamic market, with the company also securing orders from Latin American and European customers in 2023, both for fleet growth and replacement. In total, 160 new routes were opened with ATR aircraft last year, compared to 150 in 2022.\nAccording to information obtained by Aviacionline through Cirium, as of February 2024, there are 1506 routes around the world operated with ATR aircraft. The average distance traveled is 394 kilometers. With 143 weekly flights per direction, Gran Canaria (LPA) and Tenerife-Norte (TFN) have the highest frequency-operated ATR route globally, followed by Lanzarote (ACE) – Gran Canaria (LPA) with 142 and Kathmandu (KTM) – Pokhara (PKR) with 133.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, the ATR fleet operates 246 routes with an average distance of 370 kilometers. With 107 weekly flights per direction, Port of Spain (POS) – Tobago (TAB) has the highest frequency, followed by Medellin (EOH) – Quibdo (UIB) with 57 flights per direction and Fernando de Noronha (FEN) – Recife (REC) with 55 weekly flights per direction.\nATR also highlighted that it achieved revenues of nearly $1.2 billion for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, also supported by a record year in services, with revenues exceeding $400 million.\nRegional Market\nThe company expects higher demand in the coming years, with expected fleet growth mainly in Asia (India, Indonesia, and the Philippines) and Brazil.\nNew regulations related to increasing environmental pressure also create opportunities for ATR to capture a significant portion of the replacement market, especially in Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States, as ATR aircraft offer an immediate solution to drastically reduce emissions compared to similar-sized regional jets.\nNathalie Tarnaud Laude, CEO of ATR, said, “2024 will be a year of stabilization, paving the way for future growth, and we have already delivered two aircraft since the beginning of the year, marking a promising pace for ATR.”\n“Our 2023 results underscore the value and relevance of our products and services and our ability to adapt to the changing dynamics of the market. Our turboprops remain the backbone of many regional airline fleets, praised for their fuel efficiency, low emissions, profitability, and versatility,” she added.",
