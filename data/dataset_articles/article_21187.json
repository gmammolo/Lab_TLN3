  "text": "2024-02-16 00:21:03 The Joint European Torus (JET) fusion facility at the Culham Fusion Energy Center (UK) has set a world record for energy production. This was reported in a press release published on the website Phys.org, Day.Az reports with reference to Lenta.ru. JET is a tokamak that uses powerful magnetic fields to confine plasma. Most approaches to creating commercial nuclear fusion involve the use of two isotopes of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium. When deuterium and tritium fuse at 150 million degrees Celsius, helium is formed and a huge amount of energy is produced. It is assumed that this reaction will form the basis of future fusion power plants. During the deuterium-tritium experiments, which were carried out from August 31 to October 14, 2023, the installation produced 69 megajoules within five seconds, using only 0.2 milligrams of fuel. However, the main goal of the tests was to demonstrate minimization of the effect of heated plasma on the internal walls of the installation. According to the scientists, the experiment showed how to cool the exhaust gases, as well as how to stabilize the edge of the plasma to prevent energy emissions from contacting the wall. Both methods, the effectiveness of which was first demonstrated in the deuterium-tritium environment, are intended to protect fusion plants from failure.
