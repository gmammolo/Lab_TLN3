  "text": "'It’s super exciting': New signings impress in first bullpen SURPRISE, Ariz. -- [Seth Lugo](https://www.mlb.com/player/607625) and [Michael Wacha](https://www.mlb.com/player/608379), two of the Royals' major signings this offseason, threw off the mound for the first time with their new team on Thursday. Lugo, who signed a [two-year deal](https://www.mlb.com/royals/news/seth-lugo-royals-free-agent-deal), threw to catcher Salvador Perez, while Wacha, who signed a [one-year pact](https://www.mlb.com/royals/news/michael-wacha-deal-with-royals), had Freddy Fermin as his backstop. Perez also caught closer [Will Smith](https://www.mlb.com/player/will-smith-519293), who also [signed with Kansas City this past offseason](https://www.mlb.com/royals/news/will-smith-royals-free-agent-deal). The Royals’ veteran catcher has quite a few new arms to learn this spring. “I’m super excited about these guys,” Perez said. “They know how to pitch in the big leagues. I can’t wait for the first game in Spring Training and the first of the season. I think we’ll do much better this year with these pitchers. I’ve done a lot of talking with these guys, try to have a good relationship with them. Trying to be on the same page with them, what they’re trying to throw and what part of my body they want to throw to, so when the time comes for the game, we’re on the same page. It’s super exciting.” Additional notes • The Royals are expecting lefty Angel Zerpa and catcher Rodolfo Durán to arrive in Arizona on Thursday afternoon and be in camp on Friday. Zerpa is scheduled for his first bullpen Friday morning. Durán and Zerpa's arrivals were delayed due to visa/passport issues. • Lefty Austin Cox, who tore his left ACL last September, has had a speedy recovery so far. He is already throwing bullpens and threw a light one on Thursday morning. He’s still being cautious, especially with running, but he’s optimistic about his chances to return to the mound this year. Cox was non-tendered this offseason, but the Royals wanted him to stay in the organization and signed him to a Minor League deal with a non-roster invite to Spring Training. He’ll continue his recovery in Arizona while the team is here this spring.",
