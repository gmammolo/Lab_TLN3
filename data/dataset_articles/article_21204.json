  "text": "The following was released by Omega Protein and Ocean Harvesters:\nABBEVILLE, LA / ACCESSWIRE / February 15, 2024 / Today, the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission (LWFC) unanimously voted to amend its October 2023 Notice of Intent (NOI), reducing the proposed 1-mile coastwide menhaden fishing buffer to a half-mile coastwide buffer. The amended NOI also provides for a 1-mile buffer for menhaden harvesting in the waters off Holly Beach in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.\nOmega Protein and its fishing partner, Ocean Harvesters, support the Commission's decision and look forward to a productive and safe 2024 fishing season, which starts in April.\n\"Although none of the stakeholder groups achieved exactly what they were advocating for, that often makes the best compromise - to achieve an agreement through mutual concessions,\" said Ben Landry, Vice President of Public Affairs for Ocean Harvesters. \"We applaud Governor Jeff Landry, Secretary Madison Sheahan and Louisiana's Wildlife and Fisheries Commission for their hard work to forge a middle ground on this issue, and to amend the original NOI.\"\nMenhaden and the oils they produce are essential to the health of both animals and humans worldwide . Gulf menhaden fisheries are highly regulated to ensure both the highest quality product and the most sustainable harvesting practices. Louisiana and Mississippi state waters have served as a vital workplace for blue-collar fishermen and their families since the mid-20 th century. Many menhaden fishermen are lifers who take great pride in their work and the solid livelihood fishing provides their families.\nAbout Omega Protein and Ocean Harvesters: Omega Protein Corporation is a century old nutritional product company that develops, produces, and delivers healthy products throughout the world to improve the nutritional integrity of foods, dietary supplements, and animal feeds. Omega Protein's mission is to help people lead healthier lives with better nutrition through sustainably sourced ingredients such as highly refined specialty oils, specialty proteins products and nutraceuticals.
