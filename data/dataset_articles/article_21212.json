  "text": "Theodore Roosevelt National Park is a picturesque wilderness of grasslands and badlands. Bison, feral horses, and elk roam the landscapes, hiking trails meander through the colorful bentonite hills, and scenic roads take visitors to numerous stunning overlooks. In this post, learn about the best things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\nTable of Contents\nA Quick Geography Lesson\nTheodore Roosevelt is made up of three separate units: the South Unit, the North Unit, and the Elkhorn Ranch Unit.\nMap of Theodore Roosevelt National Park from the\nNational Park Service.\nThe South Unit\nMost visitors spend their time at the South Unit. It has a convenient location on Interstate 94, so it is easy to get to and there are several small towns nearby that make great places to stay.\nThe South Unit is further divided up into three more regions.\nPainted Canyon is in the east. Located right on Interstate 94, there is a Visitor Center, a rest stop for those traveling along Interstate 94, and several very good hiking trails.\nScenic Loop Drive dominates the central area of the South Unit. This 36-mile-long road leads to numerous hiking trails, overlooks, and campgrounds. Driving this loop is one of the best things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\nIn the west is Petrified Forest. To get here, you will need to drive on a gravel road, but your reward is seeing ancient, petrified logs and some of the best wildlife sightings in the park.\nMap of the South Unit | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nThe North Unit\nThe North Unit is located one hour north of the South Unit. To get here, take US-85 north from Belfield.\nThe North Unit is much more compact than the South Unit. One road, Scenic Drive, runs through this section of the park. This is 14 miles long and along this road are overlooks, trailheads, picnic areas, and campgrounds. The road ends at Oxbow Overlook. From here, you turn around and follow the same road out of the park.\nElkhorn Ranch Unit\nThis small, very remote region of the park is where Theodore Roosevelt lived after the deaths of his wife and mother. To get to this ranch, you will drive on unpaved roads, a drive that takes about an hour, one-way. Visiting this part of the park is not about hikes or scenic drives…it’s more about visiting a historical site and a place where Roosevelt found solitude during a challenging time in his life.\nWhile in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, please practice the seven principles of\nLeave No Trace: plan ahead, stay on the trail, pack out what you bring to the hiking trail, properly dispose of waste, leave areas as you found them, minimize campfire impacts, be considerate of other hikers, and do not approach or feed wildlife.\nBest Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nNext is a list of the best things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. These are listed in geographical area, starting with the South Unit, then the North Unit, and finally Elkhorn Ranch.\nThings to Do in the South Unit\nDrive Scenic Loop Drive\nScenic Loop Drive is a 36-mile-long road that makes a loop through the South Unit. From this road, you have access to numerous hiking trails and viewpoints in the park.\nTo drive this road, hike a few short trails, and visit the overlooks, it will take between a half and a full day, depending on how much you choose to do. Several of the sights that I list next in this article are located along Scenic Drive. For more information, a map, and many more photos, read our\nGuide to the South Unit.\nCurrently, part of the road is closed (miles 24 to 28), so it cannot be driven as a loop. You will have to drive it out-and-back. Get more information on the\nNational Park Service website.\nMaltese Cross Cabin\nLocation: Scenic Loop Drive\nThe Maltese Cabin was constructed for Theodore Roosevelt in the late 1800’s. He invested in the nearby Chimney Butte Ranch and this cabin was his temporary home.\nIt is located right behind the South Unit Visitor Center, so it is quick and easy to visit.\nMaltese Cross Cabin | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nSkyline Vista Overlook\nLocation: Scenic Loop Drive\nThis overlook is located right on Scenic Loop Drive, near the entrance into Theodore Roosevelt National Park. From here, you have sweeping views over Medora.\nSkyline Vista Overlook | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nHike the Wind Canyon Trail\nLocation: Scenic Loop Drive\nDistance: 0.4 miles round-trip | Difficulty: Easy to moderate | Time: 20 minutes\nFrom this trail, you get a one of the best views of the Little Missouri River. It’s a short hike with one steep climb but it is worth it for these big views.\nWind Canyon Overlook | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nLittle Missouri River | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nHike the Ekblom Trail to the Little Missouri River\nLocation: Scenic Loop Drive\nFor a chance to get up close to the Little Missouri River, hike the Eklblom Trail.\nThis hike starts at Peaceful Valley Ranch. From the ranch, it is a 0.2-mile easy hike to get to the Little Missouri River. Here’s the view:\nLittle Missouri River | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nOnce you see the river, you can call it quits and hike back to your car (for a 0.4-mile out-and-back hike) or go farther and hike the\nEkblom + Big Plateau Loop.\nIf you hike the full loop, it is a 5.2-mile hike that is moderately difficult and takes 2 to 3 hours. Parts of the hike are fun and very scenic, other parts are honestly a bit boring. But we saw tons of wildlife on this trail: a mule deer, two coyotes, a feral horse, and more prairie dogs than we could count. There is also a very good chance to see bison, but we weren’t so lucky.\nIf you are looking for an interesting hike to do in the South Unit, the Ekblom and Big Plateau Loop is one to consider.\nFeral Horse\nHiking the Ekblom + Big Plateau Loop | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nVisit Painted Canyon Overlook\nLocation: Painted Canyon\nThis stunning overlook is also one of the quickest, easiest things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\nTo visit this overlook, park in the large lot next to the Visitor Center in the Painted Canyon area of the South Unit. Walk the short, paved trail behind the Visitor Center and voila, here is the view.\nPainted Canyon Overlook | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nHike the Painted Canyon Trail\nLocation: Painted Canyon\nDistance: 4.2 miles | Difficulty: Moderate | Time: 1.5 to 2.5 hours\nThere are two great hikes to do in Painted Canyon and this is the longer of the two. The second trail, the Painted Canyon Nature Trail, starts next to the visitor center and is a 1-mile loop.\nThe Painted Canyon Trail is more interesting. The landscapes along the trail are more dramatic and since you head a bit deeper into the park (and away from the noisy, busy highway), wildlife sightings are more likely.\nWhen we did this, there was a herd of bison grazing in the fields near the endpoint of this trail.\nPainted Canyon Trail | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nBadlands and caprocks\nBison seen along the Painted Canyon Trail | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nBoicourt Overlook Trail\nLocation: Scenic Loop Drive\nDistance: 0.2 to 0.5 miles out-and-back | Difficulty: Easy | Time: 20 to 45 minutes\nThis trail offers two different viewpoints of the badlands in the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\nTake the flat, paved trail 0.1 miles to the first overlook. The view from here is just OK. It takes a bit more walking to get to the better viewpoint.\nThe paved trail turns into a dirt trail. It heads out deeper into the badlands and from the end of the trail, you get wonderful panoramic views for one of the best views of the South Unit.\nBoicourt Overlook Trail | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nView from the Boicourt Overlook Trail\nEnjoy the View from Buck Hill\nDistance: 0.2 miles out-and-back | Difficulty: Easy | Time: 15 minutes\nBuck Hill is the second highest point in the South Unit. From the parking lot, it’s a short but somewhat steep uphill walk to the viewpoint.\nBuck Hill | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nView from Buck Hill | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nBeyond the main viewpoint, the trail keeps going. We hiked it and Tim and I both think that the views are better from the overlook, so we don’t think it is worth extending this hike any farther.\nHike to the Petrified Forest\nLocation: Petrified Forest, South Unit\nIn this remote section of the South Unit, there are several small areas of petrified wood that you can hike too. It’s not quite as impressive as what you see at\nPetrified Forest National Park, but it’s worth if you like hiking, wildlife sightings, and visiting a quieter area of the park.\nTo get here, it is a 6-mile drive on gravel roads to get to the trailhead. To get to the petrified wood, hiking distances range from 3 to 10 miles, depending on which area(s) you choose to visit. This entire experience takes a few hours to half of a day.\nWe liked this experience. We saw more bison than people while in this area of the park and seeing the petrified wood is interesting.\nBelow are photos of the petrified forest, and if this sounds like something you are interested in doing, read our\nGuide to the Petrified Forest for more information.\nPetrified Wood\nThings to Do in the North Unit\nEnjoy the Views along Scenic Drive\nScenic Drive is 14 miles long (28 miles out-and-back). It starts at the entrance to the North Unit and ends at Oxbow Overlook. Without stops, it takes about 30 minutes to drive it one way.\nIt is a gorgeous drive from start to finish. This road twists and turns through the badlands, going past overlooks and next to prairie dog towns.\nAlong Scenic Drive, there is a very good chance that you will see bison. Also keep a look out for mule deer, prairie dogs, pronghorns, coyotes, and golden eagles.\nScenic Drive | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nCannonball Concretions on Scenic Drive\nPRO TRAVEL TIP: The North Unit and the South Unit are in two different time zones. The North Unit is in the Central Time Zone and the South Unit is in the Mountain Time Zone.\nLittle Mo Nature Trail\nDistance: 0.7 to 1.4 miles | Difficulty: Easy | Time: 30 to 60 minutes\nFor a short, scenic hike in the North Unit, put the Little Mo Nature Trail on your to-do list.\nThere are two ways to do this: hike the short, paved trail (0.7-mile loop) or do the longer loop (1.4 miles). The longer loop is a bit more challenging and parts of it are unpaved, but it you get great views of this part of the Little Missouri River and the North Unit.\nLittle Mo Nature Trail | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nLittle Missouri River | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nRiver Bend Overlook\nFrom this overlook, you get panoramic views of the North Unit of Theodore Roosvelt National Park. From inside the shelter, you can take some cool photos of the Little Missouri River and the badlands.\nRiver Bend Overlook | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nCaprock Coulee Trail\nDistance: 4.1-mile loop | Difficulty: Moderate | Total Ascent: 730 feet | Time: 2 to 3 hours\nThe\n Caprock Coulee Trail is one of the best things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. In fact, it is our favorite experience in the park.\nThis trail starts on the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail and then climbs up onto a plateau in the badlands. You will pass the very scenic River Bend Overlook and then you get to the best part of the hike. As the trail skirts along the edge of the badlands, you get awesome views over the Little Missouri River.\nView from the Caprock Coulee Trail | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nView of the badlands from the trail\nOxbow Overlook\nScenic Drive ends at the parking lot for Oxbow Overlook. Walk up to the viewpoint, Oxbow Overlook, where you can see an oxbow bend of the Little Missouri River.\nOxbow Overlook | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nSperati Point\nDistance: 2.4 miles | Difficulty: Easy | Time: 1 hour\nFor one of the best views of Little Missouri River in all of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, hike the Achenbach Trail to Sperati Point.\nThis hike starts at the Oxbow Overlook parking lot. It’s a rather boring hike through a grassland to get to Sperati Point, but it’s worth it for the view.\nFrom Sperati Point, you get a similar view to Oxbow Overlook, but it is more impressive from here, since you are closer to the Little Missouri River and the vantage point is better.\nSperati Point | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nElkhorn Ranch Unit\nThe Elkhorn Ranch Unit\nThe Elkhorn Ranch Unit is the most remote area of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. From Medora, it takes about an hour to drive here and most of this is on unpaved roads. But if you are looking for solitude in a national park, this is a great place to visit. Very few people venture out this way so you just may have it all to yourself.\nGetting to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit\nFrom Medora, the drive is 46 miles one-way. The final 30 miles of this road are gravel roads that head through private property. We did this drive in a Toyota Sienna Minivan (not our first choice, but it was our only option when we picked up our rental car due to low inventory) and had no issues on the drive. However, if it has recently rained or snowed, parts of the gravel road can be impassable, especially the last 3 miles of the drive. Get updates on road conditions at one of the park visitor centers before you do this drive.\nRoad to Elkhorn Ranch\nIn the park newspaper and on the\nNational Park Service website, there are detailed driving instructions for how to get to the Elkhorn Ranch Unit. We followed Google Maps and this worked fine, too. Just note that there is no cellular service at Elkhorn Ranch.\nOnce you reach the parking area, it is a 0.75-mile one-way flat, easy walk to get to the ranch.\nTheodore Roosevelt built the Elkhorn Ranch in 1885. He moved out here looking for peace not long after his wife and mother died on the same day. Sewall and Dow operated the ranch for Roosevelt for several years. Roosevelt abandoned Elkhorn Ranch in 1890 and over the years, the buildings were stripped and all that remains are the stone foundations of the cabin.\nElkhorn Ranch | Best Things to Do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nIs Visiting Elkhorn Ranch Worth It?\nFor most people, I would say no. It takes a while to get here and it’s one of the least exciting sights to see in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. I think it is only worth for those with an interest in the history of this site or those who want to explore all areas of the national park.\nBest Experiences in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nTo help narrow down the long list of things to do, here are our favorite viewpoints and hikes in Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\nBest Viewpoints in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nHere are our top 5 favorite viewpoints and their locations:\n- Sperati Point, North Unit\n- River Bend Overlook, North Unit\n- View from the Wind Canyon Trail, South Unit\n- Painted Canyon Overlook, South Unit\n- Views along Scenic Drive in the North Unit\nBest Hikes in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nHere are our top 5 favorite hikes and their locations:\n- Caprock Coulee Trail, North Unit\n- Ekblom Trail +/- Big Plateau Loop, South Unit\n- Painted Canyon Trail, South Unit\n- Boicourt Overlook Trail, South Unit\n- Little Mo Nature Trail, North Unit\nBest Unit to Visit in Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nIf you only have time to visit one section of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, I recommend the North Unit.\nThe North Unit is small and easy to visit. The drive along Scenic Drive is gorgeous from start to finish and there is a very good chance you will see bison and other wildlife on the drive.\nHike the Caprock Coulee Trail, our favorite hike in the park, and visit the numerous overlooks with their spectacular views of the Little Missouri River. The North Unit also tends to be less crowded, so that’s a bonus.\nBison in the North Unit\nTheodore Roosevelt National Park Itinerary\nIf you want to explore both the North and South Units, you will need at least two days in Theodore Roosevelt National Park (one day for each unit). Here is a day-by-day itinerary for 1 to 3 days in the park.\nDay 1: North Unit\nOne full day is all you need to thoroughly explore the North Unit. Drive Scenic Drive, visit the overlooks, hike the Little Mo Nature Trail, the Caprock Coulee Trail, and the Achenbach Trail to Sperati Point.\nDay 2: South Unit\nStart your day at the Painted Canyon area of the South Unit. Take your pick between the Painted Canyon Nature Trail (short and easier) or the Painted Canyon Trail (longer but more interesting).\nNext, drive Scenic Loop Drive, visiting the overlooks along the way. If you like hiking, we also recommend doing the Ekblom Trail and Big Plateau Loop.\nDay 3: Petrified Forest and/or Elkhorn Ranch Unit\nA visit to the Petrified Forest takes a half of a day and the Elkhorn Ranch Unit takes a half of a day, so these can be combined into one day. Or, visit one of them and use the afternoon to travel to your next destination.\nHow to Get to Theodore Roosevelt National Park\nThe South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park is located on Interstate 94 in western North Dakota. There are several small towns located nearby, these being Medora, Belfield, and Dickinson.\nHere are driving distances and times from nearby destinations to Medora:\n- Bismarck, North Dakota: 135 miles, 2 hours\n- Rapid City, South Dakota: 240 miles, 4 hours\n- Billings, Montana: 280 miles, 4 hours\n- Devils Tower, Wyoming: 230 miles, 3.5 hours\nTo get to the North Unit, it is a one-hour drive from Belfield and just over an hour drive from Medora.\nWhere to Stay\nMedora has a good location for visiting the south unit, since it is located next to the park entrance. This small, western-themed town has small shops and restaurants.\nBelfield is the next closest town but doesn’t offer a lot in the way of hotels or restaurants.\nWe stayed in Dickinson, which is about 30 minutes east of the South Unit and just over an hour away from the North Unit. There are numerous hotels to choose from, with popular chains such as\nTownePlace Suites by Marriott (this is where we stayed), La Quinta by Wyndham, Candlewood Suites, and Hampton Inn & Suites.\nIn Dickinson, we highly recommend the Brickhouse Grille (great steaks, salads, and seafood) or Phat Fish Brewing (brewery with beer flights and bar food) for dinner.\nIn the North Unit, camping at the\nJuniper Campground is first-come, first-serve. With a free permit, you can also camp in the backcountry.\nPlan Your Visit\nCost: $30 per private vehicle, valid for 7 days\nHours of Operation: The South Unit and the North Unit are open 24 hours a day all year. This includes all three areas of the South Unit. Visitor Center hours vary by season and you can get updated hours on the\nhttps://www.nps.gov/thro/planyourvisit/hours.htm\nBefore you go, check the\nNational Park Service website for park conditions and updates on road closures and trail closures.\nIf you have any questions about the best things to do in Theodore Roosevelt National Park, let us know in the comment section below.\nWhere Are You Going Next?\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT: For more information about how to visit Theodore Roosevelt National Park, read our\nGuide to the South Unit and our Guide to the North Unit.\nSOUTH DAKOTA ITINERARY: If you also have plans to visit South Dakota, don’t miss our\nOne Week South Dakota Itinerary.\nYELLOWSTONE: If this is part of a road trip with Yellowstone, learn how to plan your visit in our\nYellowstone National Park Travel Guide.
