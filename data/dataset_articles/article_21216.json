  "text": "The Green Party supports The Waitangi Tribunal holding a priority kaupapa inquiry into climate change policy. \"We applaud the collective action taken by Climate Justice Taranaki to take climate change to the Waitangi Tribunal for an urgent inquiry. And we stand by their claim that the Crown is breaching Te Tiriti o Waitangi failing to protect Te Iwi Māori from climate change impacts.\" says Green Party Māori Development Spokesperson, Hūhana Lyndon. \"The Government is willing to trash our taiao to pay for their tax cuts - raiding the climate emergency response fund, cutting transport projects that reduce emissions, like public transport and bike lanes, and ending the oil and gas ban. For too long, legacy parties have played politics with our planet - favouring polluting industries at the expense of protecting communities and the planet. Aotearoa is not willing to accept this. \"As kaitiaki of te taiao, we have consistently seen tangata whenua at the forefront, advocating for our communities in the wake of climate-change powered disasters, in Auckland, Te Tairawhiti, and the Hawke's Bay. We know tangata whenua are more likely to be impacted by climate change than other New Zealanders. \"A better future is possible, one where our tamariki swim in clean waters, gather kai moana and live in harmony with the natural world. There is no time to waste, we must act now to ensure a thriving taiao for our mokopuna and future generations. Honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi is our future - for people and planet.\" says Hūhana Lyndon. [here](/greens-support-waitangi-tribunals-climate-1175391/).",
