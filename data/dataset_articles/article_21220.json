Children ages 1-10 years old are invited to claim some of the thousands of Lyman's own eco-certified apples hidden in our Hay Maze on the grounds of the Apple Barrel Farm Market on Saturday, April 13th. It's a picture perfect activity, creating family memories on the farm.\nJoin us for a free Magic Show with\nBill Hoagland after the Apple Hunt on the Apple Barrel Farm Market Patio, 11am & 11:45am.\nApple Hunt admission is $15.00 per child (ages 1 to 10 years old) and includes a Spring Apple Hunt T-Shirt. Every child participating in the Hunt receives a Lyman Orchards Spring Apple Hunt T-shirt.\n*New This Year* T-shirt size selection will be made during the check-in process the day of the event (not in advance). We will have a variety of sizes at check-in; preferred shirt sizes are not guaranteed - but we will do our absolute best! T-shirts will be given at check-in before the hunts begin.\nThe Apple Barrel Farm Market opens at 9am for coffee, donuts, and plenty of freshly baked goods!

Please remember that one adult is allowed to enter the Apple Hunting area with children in the 1-3 and 4-6 age groups. You will be asked to hang behind while the children start the hunt, and you will be able to join in minutes later. Parents are not permitted to accompany their child into the Apple Hunting area for children ages 7 and above. All sales final; no refunds.\nCheck-in Info:\nArrive up to 60 minutes prior to the ticket time for check-in.\nOnce tickets are purchased online, you will receive an email confirmation/receipt.\nPresent your receipt (on your phone or printed copy) to our staff at the check-in tables near the Apple Hunt area.\nCheck-on is based upon the first letter of your last name.\nWhat if it Rains?\nIf the Apple Hunt is postponed due to inclement weather on April 13th, your Apple Hunt tickets are valid for the rain-date of Sunday, April 14th.\nWe will notify everyone by email and Facebook if we need to reschedule.",
