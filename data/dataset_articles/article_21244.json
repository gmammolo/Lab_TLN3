With the seemingly endless supply, he is confident about the longevity of his business.\nHe is also open to competitors stepping in to the market.\n\"This also help reduce pollution to the environment and encourages people to collect plastic bottles to sell to us at a higher price, which in turn, could earn them a better living,\" he said.\n(Writing by Juarawee Kittisilpa; Editing by Martin Petty and Alison Williams)\nTRENDING 1.
