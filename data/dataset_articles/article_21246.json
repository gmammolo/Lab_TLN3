Morris, the driving force behind Thunder Ridge, calls the project, “A gift to the people and heritage of the Ozarks.”\nA highly specialized team utilizing biomimicry architectural techniques has fused the musical showcase with a capacity of 18,000 into the world around it with every seat holding breathtaking views of 1,200 acres of Table Rock Lake, inlets and infinite verdant forested Boston Mountain vistas.\nMorris and his team believe Thunder Ridge Nature Arena will be an unparalleled outdoor live-entertainment experience including a never-before-seen luxury box embellishment called “The Nature Tower.” Rising 12 stories from the Ozark limestone and dolomite earth, four of its floors will contain VIP suites replete with bedrooms, unobstructed views of the performing stage, and panoramic nature sightlines.\nIndustry giant ASM Global is contracted to manage and operate the facility and has partnered with Live Nation to produce live-music events. Thunder Ridge’s unveiling has begun attracting the attention of superstars like Chris Stapleton whose upcoming July appearance sold out in minutes.\nASM Global CEO Ron Bension said, “We are so pleased to join with Johnny Morris to operate this unique and spectacular venue.

A true experience unlike any other.”\nLive Nation’s President of U.S. Concerts, Bob Roux, said, “Thunder Ridge will absolutely be a must-stop for some of the biggest musical acts in the industry. The stunning surroundings, beautiful structures and the venue itself create an extraordinary musical moment for guests.”\nMorris’ vision for creating “America’s most beautiful outdoor amphitheater” is deeply rooted in conservation.
