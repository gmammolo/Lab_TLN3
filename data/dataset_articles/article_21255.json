Led by Mara Bún, a prominent figure in sustainable finance, the event will spotlight three pioneering case studies driving tangible progress in the fight against climate change. From the innovative 'Coal-To-Clean' Credit Program in Emerging Economies to the ambitious Mongolian 1 Billion Trees Program and the transformative Brazilian Floresta Viva Program, attendees will gain invaluable insights into initiatives reshaping the landscape of climate finance. With Dr. Rob Hales facilitating discussions on innovation and government intervention, the event offers a unique opportunity for stakeholders to explore the intersection of policy, finance, and sustainability. Moreover, participants will have the chance to network with government officials and NGO leaders from South Asia and Mongolia, fostering collaboration and collective action in addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our time.
