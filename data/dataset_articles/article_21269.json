  "text": "The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) have named seven initiatives from Africa, Latin America, the Mediterranean and South Asia as UN World Restoration Flagships.\nA statement by UNEP said the initiatives include ecosystems at the tipping point of outright degradation resulting from wildfires, drought, deforestation and pollution.\nIt said they are now eligible for technical and financial UN support.\nThe World Restoration Flagship awards are part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration - led by UNEP and FAO - which aims to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean.\nThe awards track notable initiatives that support global commitments to restore one billion hectares, an area larger than China.\nAccording to the statement, the winning initiatives are announced ahead of the 6th session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-6), the world's highest-level decision-making body for matters related to the environment, taking place from February 26 - March 1 at UNEP headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya.\nIt said together, the seven new flagships are expected to restore nearly 40 million hectares and create around 500,000 jobs.\nThe Executive Director of UNEP, Inger Andersen, said for too long, economic development came at the expense of the environment. Yet today we see global efforts to usher in a comeback for nature.\n\"These initiatives show how we can make peace with nature, put local communities at the heart of restoration efforts and still create new jobs. As we continue to face a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, now is the time we must double down and accelerate restoration initiatives.\"\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox\nTop Headlines Nigeria International Organisations Environment Submit By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy .\nSuccess!
