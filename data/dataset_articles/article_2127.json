The mother stated that Hill is \"very aggressive and impulsive\" and that she feared for her daughter's safety.\nAuthorities said Vaccaro called the police after claiming she saw Tyreek Hill throw a computer to the ground, then pick up his daughter and begin arguing with his wife.\nVer esta publicación en Instagram Keeta Hill told police that she and Tyreek Hill had been arguing more frequently and stated that \"he gets angry and throws things,\" according to the report.\nThe complaints reportedly state that Keeta confronted Tyreek about not being involved in raising their daughter. Police also noted, \"Keeta is in the process of filing for divorce.\"\nVer esta publicación en Instagram Although Tyreek and his wife said the fight did not become physical, police observed that Keeta had a bruise on her upper chest.\nShe said he may have caused it unintentionally when he took the baby from her.
