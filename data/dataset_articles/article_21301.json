  "text": "Video shows woman shooing moose from grocery cart ANCHORAGE, Alaska ( [KTUU](https://www.alaskasnewssource.com/2024/02/15/video-shows-anchorage-woman-shooing-moose-grocery-cart/)/Gray News) - Interactions with moose are not an uncommon scene around Alaska, but when they find an interest in groceries, Alaskans just can’t help but whip out their phones. That was the scene on Feb. 10 when an Anchorage woman on a grocery run found herself in a Costco parking lot, caught between her cart full of food and a hungry bull moose. Amber Rotar was the woman trying to shoo the moose away and decided once it became clear he wasn’t budging, she’d whip her phone camera out — with the cart and her car between them, of course. “Thankfully, I didn’t have my kids, so it’s like, I don’t have to worry about not having my children trampled,” Rotar said. “But no, I just tried not to aggravate him.” Rotar posted the video to her [business social media pages](https://www.facebook.com/feedmeak/posts/888920153243184) for Feed Me AK, a meal prep delivery service that she owns and operates. The mother of two was also captured by another bystander across the lot, whose photo made its way onto the usual Facebook group pages, garnering dozens of comments and likes with the caption “Only in Alaska” attached to it. In the photo taken by the other woman, Rotar can be seen holding up a stern finger, pointing at the moose as if giving it a warning. “He came over and stuck his face in my sweet potatoes and was also quite curious about my ... flannel sheets, and then bell peppers,” Rotar said. Rotar tells the moose to “Scooch!” as it peruses her basket of goodies, but once the moose put its ears back — a key sign of agitation in a moose — Rotar takes a step back. “We only got about 9-10 seconds because when his behavior — his ears changed, I decided it was probably more important to focus on him and not on my phone.” Copyright 2024 KTUU via Gray Media Group, Inc.
