  "text": "Accra’s Mayor, Elizabeth Naa Kwatsoe Sackey, has commended J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited, an accredited waste management firm, for procuring three new fleet vehicles to enhance service delivery in waste collection, treatment, and disposal and elevate sanitation standards in Accra.\nThe Mayor commended J. Stanley Owusu Company Limited on Wednesday when the fleet consisting of two compactors and one roll-on, roll-off truck was presented at the Accra City Hall, stating that the addition was in line with the President’s vision of transforming Accra into the cleanest city in Africa.\nShe urged other waste management firms to similarly expand their vehicle fleets to combat monopolies and foster healthy competition and productivity within the sub-metros.\nMayor Sackey emphasized the direct link between sanitation and climate change and admonished residents to refrain from burning waste and instead collaborate with accredited waste companies to recycle waste, ensuring the success of AMA’s source separation program.\nShe added that under her leadership, the Assembly has introduced some innovative measures such as the Street Sweepers Initiative, the Creating Livelihood Environmentalism in Accra Now (CLEAN) project, and Zero Waste Street among others as part of continuing efforts to achieve a clean and liveable city.\nThe General Manager responsible for Finance and Administration at J Stanley Owusu Company Limited, Joshua Abrako Darko, said his entity was positioning itself to deliver quality service and disclosed that consignments of new trucks were expected to arrive next year.\nHe stated that the presentation was done to inform the AMA about the new trucks, demonstrate competence, and update its record system to ensure transparency.\nMr. Darko outlined plans to establish landfills in all sixteen regions nationwide. He emphasized that J. Stanley Owusu was aware of the operational challenges and diligently procured new fleets to enhance service delivery.\nThe fleet of vehicles is set to operate within the Okaikoi South Sub-Metropolitan District, except the Bubui Electoral Area.\nPresent at the ceremony were the Coordinating Director for the AMA, Douglas N.K Annoful, Director of Finance Mr. Abeiku Amissah, Director of Waste Management Solomon Noi, and Deputy Director for Waste Management Mr. Victor Kotey, among others.\nExplore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!\nClick on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU:\nhttps://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCYzPRAYlUPudDDe53x\nNo spams, just the stories that truly matter! #StayInformed #CitiNewsroom #CNRDigital",
