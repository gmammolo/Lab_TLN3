  "text": "TULSA, Okla. — In just a few weeks, pallets of playground equipment will be transformed into a safe space for kids to play outdoors at the Common Good’s community center in northwest Tulsa. Stephen Pyle, Executive Director of the Common Good, shared his vision for the space for the kids who participate in their afterschool programming with us on Thursday. He said the outdoor component is key. “We operate in an old warehouse market grocery store so there’s no windows within our facilities, and so it’s great for our kids to be able to come outside, see the fresh sunshine have the wind in their face and play together,\" Pyle said. The addition of community gardens will allow residents to grow fresh produce, something that appeals to neighbor and mother Krystal Kite. “With the food garden I’m really excited about that,” she said. “We are a food desert.” She said having an enclosed playground with good lighting is important as there are a number of stray dogs in the neighborhood. “I feel like having it enclosed it makes it a little safer,” she added. Kite said the parks in her neighborhood also have drug use, so moms often find needles and left-over trash. The new playground at the Hub at the Common Good is expected to be open by March 15. While most of the $180,000 project is being paid for by a matching grant, the nonprofit is still looking to raise an additional $15,000.
