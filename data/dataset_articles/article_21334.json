  "text": "ANN/THE STAR – We’ve stepped into a fresh year, and there’s been a notable surge in popularity for certain plants like hybrid flowers, indoor plants, and herbs. Mohd Firdaus Abd Jalil, a 36-year-old co-owner of a home-based plant nursery in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, has observed an increasing interest in hybrid flowers. “One of our top sellers is the Imperial Dragon hybrid hibiscus. The petals of the Imperial Dragon are salmon orange hues and dark purple in the centre,” said Mohd Firdaus. He also mentioned that Japanese hybrid roses are experiencing an increasing demand. “In recent years, flower breeders from Japan and China have created hybrid flowers that are well suited to our hot climate. Such plants perform better in our weather compared to roses imported from Europe. These hybrid plants come in vibrant and attractive colours too,” Mohd Firdaus shared. He said many people are still drawn to cultivating roses although they are often perceived as difficult to care for due to watering needs and specific soil requirements. He reckons the popularity could be due to their aesthetic appeal and the satisfaction of nurturing them into blooms. “Caring for roses requires discipline. One needs to adhere to scheduled tasks, including fertilising, watering, pruning and pesticide application. “Following these schedules diligently results in improvements in the growth and optimal blooming of roses. “Furthermore, the blooming time can be strategically set to coincide with festive seasons. Planning involves scheduling pruning and allowing plants to rest in accordance with the calendar, ensuring a well-organised and effective care cycle.” Meanwhile, plant nursery owner Lourdes Surendren has seen a substantial 60 per cent surge in sales of herbs at his shop in Sungai Buloh, Selangor in the last few weeks. “Customers from diverse backgrounds, including Indians, Chinese and Malays, are embracing Indian medicinal herbs like karpuravalli (Indian oregano) and tulsi (holy basil),” he said. On average, the nursery sells between 20 and 40 of these plants each week. Plants like turmeric and ginger, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, are also gaining popularity. Lourdes has also noticed a rise in online sales for herbaceous plants such as bay laurel (its leaves are used for seasoning), basil and rosemary. “These days, people increasingly opt for online shopping due to its convenience. Rather than making the physical trip to our nursery in Sg Buloh, many customers prefer the ease of ordering plants with just a few clicks of the mouse.” Here are some of the top trending plants for 2024: HYBRID HIBISCUS These plants are the result of crossing two different varieties or species of plants to create offspring with specific desired traits. Demand for hybrid hibiscus plants is growing due to their diverse colour variations and low-maintenance requirements. MONEY PLANT Also known as pothos or devil’s ivy, this creeper is believed to attract prosperity and luck. Taking care of a money plant is simple, given its low-maintenance nature. Whether grown outdoors or indoors, it thrives in various containers such as small or medium-sized pots, baskets and hanging vessels, or even hydroponically in a water-filled glass vase. SNAKE PLANT Popularly known as mother-in-law’s tongue or sansevieria, this plant also does not take much effort to maintain. It is hardy, versatile and thrives both outdoors and indoors. Some people believe the plant helps attract money, prosperity and good energy. SPIDER PLANT These easy-to-grow houseplants are known for their longevity. They are also widely believed to have air-purifying qualities but you will need a certain number of plants for a specific area of space in order to derive such benefits. HERBS Herbs are also popular among Malaysians as they are believed to help boost immunity. Tulsi is sought-after for its purported effectiveness in treating a dry cough and asthma, while karpuravalli leaf extract is commonly used by many to help address respiratory problems. – Sheela Chandran",
