  "text": "No offensive language will be tolerated on Celebrity Big Brother UK.\nMickey Rourke was issued a warning from the reality television series’ producers after a series of comments he made toward fellow competitor JoJo Siwa, according to BBC. During the 24th season, the actor asked Siwa if she liked “girls or boys,” to which the “Karma” singer explained that she’s attracted to women and that her partner Kath Ebbs is non-binary.\n“If I stay longer than four days,” the 72-year-old then responded, “you won’t be gay anymore.”\nSiwa replied by assuring, “I can guarantee I’ll still be gay and I’ll still be in a very happy relationship.”\nLater in the series, when the cast mates were called to vote someone out of the house, Mickey explained that he’s “going to vote the lesbian out real quick,” to which Siwa — who overheard the comment, replied, “That’s homophobic, if that was your reasoning.”\nAt one point in the series, Rourke said that he needed a “f–,” and gestured to the 21-year-old star and said, “I’m not talking to you.” When fellow competitor Chris Hughes called him out for the language, the actor said, “I know. I was talking about a cigarette.”\nAfter using the slur, which is slang for a cigarette in the U.K., he was warned by the ITV series’ Big Brother about his actions in the confessional room. “Big Brother thinks your language was offensive and unacceptable,” he was told. “As a result, Big Brother is giving you a formal warning. Further language or behaviour of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”\nUltimately, the actor explained that he didn’t have “dishonorable intentions” and apologized to Siwa. “I want to apologize. I’ve got a habit of having a short fuse,” he told her. “And I don’t mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn’t, I wouldn’t say it to you.”\n“I appreciate your apology,” she replied. Siwa has yet to publicly address the situation.\n Read More Details\nFinally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( Mickey Rourke Given ‘Formal Warning’ for ‘Offensive’ Comments About JoJo Siwa in ‘Big Brother’ )\nAlso on site :",
