  "text": "YEMASSEE — One of the largest tracts of undeveloped waterfront land in South Carolina's Lowcountry, some 4,400 acres in rural Jasper County, has been acquired by The Nature Conservancy.\nThe $35 million deal for Gregorie Neck in Yemasee was announced Feb. 15.\nThe property straddles Interstate 95 and has deep-water access on the Coosawhatchie and Tulifiny rivers. A portion of the property extends into the footprint of a Civil War battle waged as Major Gen. William Sherman's Union troops pushed through on their March to the Sea.\nThe property was listed for sale last year by Charleston-based\nHolcombe Fair & Lane real estate company.\n“This region is experiencing such intense growth; when we saw the opportunity to protect a property like this — with so much water frontage and direct interstate access — we knew we had to make it happen,” Dale Threatt-Taylor, executive director of The Nature Conservancy in South Carolina, said in a statement announcing the sale.\n“Developing Gregorie Neck would have had a huge impact on this region’s nature and wildlife, as well as its infrastructure needs and traffic,\" his message said. \"Instead, we hope this project now will accelerate regional land protection efforts.\"\nThe property is located about an hour northeast of Savannah and 1½ hours southwest of Charleston.\nThe 6,700-acre Mackay Point sits to the east of the property, across the Tulifiny River, and is under a conservation easement with Lowcountry Land Trust. The Nature Conservancy and Open Space Institute protect the 12,000-acre Buckfield property to the northwest of Gregorie Neck in Hampton and Jasper counties.\nThe conservancy has an agreement with Beaufort-based\nOpen Land Trust to place Gregorie Neck under a conservation easement, which will permanently limit development to no more than six homesteads. Once that easement is in place, the conservancy plans to sell off the property to buyers bound by the set terms.\nThe massive property helps bridge conservation efforts from the Savannah River Basin to the ACE Basin — one of the largest undeveloped wetland ecosystems on the Atlantic Coast, positioned around the Ashepoo, Combahee and Edisto rivers. The green band between those basins is under intense development pressure, particularly around the Port Royal Sound, said David Bishop, the conservancy's coastal and midlands conservation director.\n“What happens in Jasper County matters to Beaufort County, and what happens on Gregorie Neck has a direct impact on the water quality of Port Royal Sound,” said Kristin Williams, executive director of Open Land Trust, noting that the conservation easement will permanently protect more than 13 miles of river frontage and the property’s rural character.\n\"... This property is truly the heart of the Port Royal Sound, waters on which all of Beaufort and Jasper County depend, and the heart of the protected connected greenbelt around Beaufort, Jasper and our military bases,\" Williams said.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has awarded $6 million toward the Gregorie Neck project through a Readiness and Environment Protection Integration (REPI) Challenge grant to prevent incompatible development and protect landscapes near the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.\nOpen Land Trust has applied for a $1 million grant from the Beaufort County Greenspace Program, which was established in 2022 through a 1-percent sales tax for land conservation — both inside and outside the county. The grant request, already recommended by a committee, will be reviewed in March.\nOpen Land Trust also has requested funding from the S.C. Conservation Bank, which will consider the request next month.\nThe Nature Conservancy in 2021 helped permanently protect Charleston County’s third-largest undeveloped property, the 2,101-acre Willtown tract located near Adams Run.\n“Unlike so many miles of waterfront in our state, the future of Gregorie Neck now is certain,” said Threatt-Taylor of the conservancy. “The very limited development allowed by this approach will leave thousands of acres of marsh, woods and fields intact for wildlife and water quality.”",
