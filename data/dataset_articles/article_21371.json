  "text": "PETALING JAYA: An animated short film on the pangolin and the dangers the animal faces from traffickers is being launched online in celebration of World Pangolin Day on Saturday (Feb 17). The almost four-minute animation, titled \"The Astounding Secret Pangolin\", tells how the anteater's scaly hide is both its armour and a vulnerability as it is highly sought after by poachers. Launched online by wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic, the short was made by Malaysian animator Faril Izzadi Mohd Noor, based on a picture book of the same name by United Kingdom-based illustrator Jeanette Ward and book designer Mary Hays. ALSO READ: Genetic test tracks origins of illegal pangolin products in China, adding to conservation toolkit Tailored for young students, the animation was designed to be used in tandem with English language and art exercises to showcase the pangolin's many unique features. \"The lessons and a fact sheet for teachers have been designed to help them broach the issue of poaching and illegal trade with a young audience, especially those who live in countries with wild pangolins or where it may be consumed,\" said Traffic in a statement on Friday (Feb 16). Hays, who came up with the idea of a picture book when she heard about the plight of pangolins, approached Ward to illustrate it. \"In 2016, I was looking for an idea for a children's story when I came across a Cambridge Museum of Zoology fact sheet on pangolins. \"Astonished that I'd never heard of this extraordinary mammal, I wondered how to tell, in some respects, this devastating story specifically to children. ALSO READ: Little-known pangolin presence on Gaya Island plays key role in ecosystem \"It needed to be both factual and endearing, and I knew Jeanette would be the perfect illustrator for the task! Her attention to detail and sensitive, empathetic approach has perfectly conveyed both the unique charm of these creatures and their precarious situation. \"It is fantastic to see it brought even further to life with Faril's gentle animation,\" said Hays. \"It's wonderful working with Traffic and to play our part in helping young people understand just how important and astounding pangolins really are,\" said Ward. Both Ward and Hays donated the use of the book's words and images to Traffic after being inspired by the organisation's work on pangolins. Faril previously served as a graphic designer at Traffic's South-East Asia programme office. Faril said the project perfectly combined his passions for art and wildlife, something he had always wanted to do. ALSO READ: Pangolin scales trade cracked \"I feel fortunate to have had this opportunity and hope this animation can bring us a step closer to saving pangolins.\" The mother pangolin and its pup in the animation are inspired by the Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), which is found in South-East Asia, including Malaysia. Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic director for South-East Asia, thanked Hays, Ward and Faril for their masterful work in creating the stunning visuals and captivating storytelling, and for choosing to partner with the organisation. \"We hope it ignites curiosity and interest in conservation in young minds and educators alike,\" she said. Believed to be the world's most trafficked mammal, the pangolin is sought by poachers for its scales, which are wrongly believed to have medicinal properties. ALSO READ: Sunda pangolins facing extinction due to poaching Several pangolin species have been hunted to near extinction. South-East Asia is not only a major source and consumer of Asian pangolin species but also a destination and transit point for trafficked African pangolin species. Despite the prohibition on all pangolin species from commercial international trade since 2019, more than 2,300 pangolin trafficking seizures were recorded across Asia between 2014 and last year. A total volume of 419 tonnes of pangolin parts was confiscated, comprising almost 48,500 whole animals and 319 tonnes of pangolin scales.
