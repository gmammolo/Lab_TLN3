  "text": "‘Can I try’: Injured Sarah Hirini refusing to give up on Paris Olympics dream\nAustralia’s premier women’s rugby players will receive a guaranteed $72,458 in 2024 following a 28 per cent increase from Rugby Australia.\nThe governing body’s chief executive\nPhil Waugh on Friday conceded the code still has a “lot of work to do” to close the payment gap after announcing it had increased investment in women’s rugby for a second successive year.\nRugby Australia (RA) pledged more than $3 million while committing to additional funding, more Tier 1 contracts for Wallaroos and higher player payments.\nThe code also aims to implement a world-class high-performance system for the 15-a-side women’s game.\nThe uplift comes on the back of a promising season for the Wallaroos in 2023, capped by a third-place finish at World Rugby’s inaugural WXV global tournament in New Zealand last November.\nWith the women’s 2029\nRugby World Cup to be held at home, RA is eager to build a lasting legacy as it embarks on the runway towards this marquee event.\n“We have identified Rugby Australia’s sevens program as the benchmark for us to emulate,” said RA chief executive Phil Waugh.\n“(It is) one of the most elite fulltime and fully professional women’s sports programs in the country and (has) achieved remarkable success for more than a decade.\n“We saw a significant increase in participation among women and girls last year, and much of that was in sevens.\n“This followed an unprecedented 2022 when our women’s sevens team won all three major trophies on offer, proving that success can genuinely drive interest and participation – and this is the opportunity with women’s XVs.\n“We will continue to grow the women’s game in a sustainable and responsible way.\n“We still have a lot of work to do, but the increase in our commitment over the last two years shows our determination to continue pushing forward.”\nTier 1-contracted players can earn $72,458 a year in RA payments for Wallaroos and Super Rugby Women’s participation, up from a maximum $56,000 in 2023.\nThe figures do not include additional player payments from Super Rugby clubs.\nAndy Farrell is a much-changed coach from the one who critics felt was facing the sack three years ago\nJack Crowley's seamless ascent to the number 10 jersey has assuaged the great man's retirement.\nJosh Lord could be the answer as New Zealand seek to replace lock legends Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock.\n Josh Lord and eventually Fabian Holland are the most promising, the latter isn’t eligible for almost two more seasons, while Lord is pretty lightweight and gets injured every other minute. Wonderful man Wayne Smith. Recently read his biography “Smithy” by Phil Gifford. A great book . Loved his play for Canterbury in the great Ranfurly Shield team of the 1980’s. In the 90’s he coached the Crusaders to there first 2 titles in 1998 and 1999. But his body of work in the service of NZ rugby is huge.I ran in to him a few weeks ago and said how highly I enjoyed the book. Well losing Tuipolotu and Akira is likely to see them replaced with players with a workrate. Might turn out to be a blessing in diguise, despite Cotters squad basically being MacDonald’s inherited big game chokers. <a href=\"https://www.rugbypass.com/news/the-all-blacks-depth-chart-roigard-leads-at-halfback/\"> Roigard, Ratima, Hotham and Fakatava, and maybe Xavier Roe.\nThe rest are journeymen who shouldn’t be anywhere near an All Blacks squad. </a> Well he’s got a famous Kiwi league father if England don’t want him, NZ could use a proper No.8 if Ardie gets put back in his rightful position. It wouldn’t be hard to pick a squad from that lot which would give the first team a run for its money. They will still choke at the next World Cup with a foreigner as coach ha ha It is interesting that Crowley has replaced one of Ireland’s great 10’s in Sexton, just as Sexton did himself, when he replaced Ronan O’Gara. Time will tell, but for the past year, I have felt that Crowley may prove to be another very good 10. Mind you, I still think Ireland has let a very good man go over the seas to Scotland. Ben Healy is, in my view, a very good 10 indeed, and I would hope he is the replacement for the great Finn. Hotham is no 4. The rest below that have no chance. The current Ireland squad are clearly better than all the SH team - by a massive distance s. The SH teams haven’t been good for a decade. They just live off uncompentwnce of bad referees. I think a series win in NZ ranks fairly high on the rugby totem pole, so we’ll take that. Our failure again at the RWC is frustrating and disappointing although I think a win against the ultimate winners and a four point loss to NZ isn’t a cause for shame. The fact that Kiwis now hate us is a big step up from being held in contempt. I see Nigel has quietly changed his opinion from what he, Wayne Barnes and other experts and indeed the on field team mistakenly said on match day. and that subtle little change is from “conclusive” to “clear” evidence. The latest version of the TMO protocol has NO REQUIREMENT! for conclusive evidence. a small and inconsequential change you may say. No, not at all. because while there may not have been conclusive evidence, being that the specific interface between the ground and ball was not visible there was however clear evidence that the ball was grounded as stated by the TMO himself. in fact, regardless of the question the ref asked the only obligation for the on field team was to make the best match day decision. if you don’t believe go read the protocol yourself. Are A team fixtures considered tests? I personally don’t think they should be I wonder, as I did at the time, if a fresh pair of legs over the last 15/20 in the QF against ABs might have produced a different outcome. Sexton walked the last quarter and presented zero challenge for the defenders well drilled with an attacking strategy they were unwilling to deviate from <a href=\"https://www.rugbypass.com/plus/four-changes-farrell-made-to-reset-ireland-on-a-path-to-glory/\"> Altogether now:\nIreland will win the World Cup </a> Still, amongst all those Kiwi Irish Aussie Irish South African Irish Dutch Irish & American Irish, it’s not a bad Irish team to be fair. Why can’t the ref just say “I think it’s held up, but can you check to see if there’s a grounding please?”",
