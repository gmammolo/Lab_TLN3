  "text": "How about shorts with a detachable reusable tote bag or a bucket hat that doubles as a bag? These are some of the apparel you can find in Mandai Wildlife Group's new capsule collection, Good Threads. Consisting of 200 multi-functional pieces, the fashion collection was designed to help wearers make eco-friendly decisions in everyday life.\nPhotograph: Mandai Wildlife Group Good Threads was developed over six months in collaboration with Hakim Samat, a locally-based crafter known for his custom-made, upcycled creations. Sporting a rugged, patchwork look, the shirts, pants, hats, and bags in Good Threads are made from 1,158 pieces of pre-loved clothing and salvaged materials from local thrift stores like honsieponsie, Function Five Thrift Shop, and Woofie's Warehouse, as well as a grassroots textile collection drive . Buttons, carabiner hooks, and other hardware were sourced from Plastify, a homegrown startup that turns plastic trash into treasure .\nPhotograph: Mandai Wildlife Group The Good Threads capsule collection will be released in three phases. The first release is now available for purchase, consisting of the Takeaway Shirt, which has multiple pockets and compartments where you can keep your reusable utensils and bottles handy; the Tote Shorts, with a detachable reusable bag for spontaneous grocery shopping sprees; the Trashy Pants, with has a dual pocket organiser to help you separate plastic trash as well as a removable trash pouch; and the Bucket-Bag Hat, a convertible bucket hat that you can also use as a cute bag.\nPhotograph: Mandai Wildlife Group Subsequent releases are planned on March 8 and 28. Many items from the first collection are already sold out, so get shopping now at goodthreadsbymandai.sg/ . What's more, all proceeds from the sale of Good Threads will go towards supporting wildlife conservation efforts in Singapore and Southeast Asia.\nREAD MORE\nThe best thrift stores in Singapore\nThe best local sustainable, vegan, and eco-friendly brands in Singapore\nSMRT will permanently roll out local folk-inspired chimes across trains at over 70 stations\nCheryl Sekkappan Deputy Editor, Time Out Singapore",
