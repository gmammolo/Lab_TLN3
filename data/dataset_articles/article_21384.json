  "text": "Student Swap Shop returns to encourage sustainable behaviour Vita Student in Exeter, located at Portland House, is thrilled to announce the return of the Vita Student Swap Shop, an initiative that aims to encourage sustainable behaviour, increasing the lifecycle of products and reducing waste for students. The average amount of waste thrown away by each person in the UK is 409kg each year*, meaning the average person is having a significant impact on the environment. The Vita Student Swap Shop will teach the next generation about the significance of giving their items a second lease of life and help to reduce the impact on the environment, to take with them in their life beyond university. Students will be able to donate and pick up everything from course textbooks to clothing. Helping students pick up necessities for life at university for free from their peers and also easing the cost to study. Max Bielby, Chief Operating Officer at Vita Student said: “Thinking about ways we can live more sustainably and adopt environmentally friendly behaviours is really important. The Vita Student Swap Shop was incredibly successful last year with residents passing on old course books, clothing and even soft furnishing, now with a fresh intake of residents, the swap shop returns to encourage this more sustainable way of living.” The Vita Student Swap Shop is currently only open to Vita Student and is located in the foyer of the building.
