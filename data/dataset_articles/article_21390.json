  "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd/TotalEnergies Joint Venture has announced the achievement of zero routine gas flare in all its assets. This is in pursuit of meeting the targets of 20 per cent (unconditional) and 47 per cent (conditional) greenhouse gas emission reduction as contained in the Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Accord signed by the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu administration. NNPC spokesman, Olufemi Soneye, who made this known in a statement, yesterday, noted that this feat was announced on Thursday during an inspection tour of OML 100 in South-eastern Niger Delta, off Port Harcourt, by a joint NNPC Ltd and TotalEnergies Team to ascertain the success of the OML Flare Reduction Project launched in December 2023. The NNPC Ltd/TotalEnergies Joint Venture, which is the concession holder of four leases, had hitherto achieved zero routine flaring across OML 99 (2006), OML 102 (2014), and OML 58 (2016), leaving OML 100 as the only lease with routine flaring going on. The NNPC said that the significance of this achievement is that the last routine flare volume of about 12 million standard cubic feet per day (12MMscf/d) of gas has now been eliminated giving rise to a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of about 341KtCO₂e/yr. The achievement, the statement added, is an outcome of a programme introduced by NNPC Ltd to galvanise action towards achieving the zero routine flare by 2030 across its portfolio of assets. “It is also a testament to NNPC Ltd’s prioritisation of sustainability anchored on the ‘first R’ of its 5R Strategy (Reduce, Replace, Renew, Re-plant, Repurpose), as it strives to reduce its carbon footprint,” the company said. It added that work is ongoing across all other assets within NNPC Ltd’s Upstream Directorate to ensure that all assets achieve zero routine flaring by 2030 or earlier.",
