  "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Today, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-PA) voted for the \" Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act of 2024 ,\" bipartisan legislation which depoliticizes the export of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) by eliminating the requirement for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to authorize its export and instead give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sole authority over the approval process.\nThursday's vote, which passed 224-200, comes just weeks after President Joe Biden ordered a de facto ban on LNG exports through the end of the year.\n\"President Biden's short-sighted energy policy fits his political needs rather than what is in America’s best interest,\" said Rep. Kelly, a member of the House Natural Gas Caucus. \"The President previously campaigned on ending fossil fuels. As the saying goes: promises made, promises kept. Except this time, his policy decision is effective immediately and it dramatically threatens Pennsylvania’s flourishing natural gas industry. Today's vote by the House takes the first major step toward repealing this dangerous policy.\"\nBACKGROUND\nOn January 26, 2024, President Biden announced a \" pause \" on pending liquified natural gas (LNG) exports. The move threatens Pennsylvania, which is the second largest natural gas producing state in the United States. Pennsylvania accounts for more than 20% of all domestic natural gas production. In all, 423,000 jobs are connected to the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania.\nIn 2023, the United States became the global leader in LNG exports, surpassing longtime leaders Qatar and Australia.\nLast week, Rep. Kelly spoke on the House floor against the Biden administration's pause on LNG exports. You can WATCH and DOWNLOAD that clip here.",
