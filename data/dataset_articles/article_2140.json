  "text": "South Korea- /\nEntertainment- /\n- KOSDAQ:A289220\nRisks Still Elevated At These Prices As GIANTSTEP Inc. (KOSDAQ:289220) Shares Dive 25%\nGIANTSTEP Inc. (KOSDAQ:289220) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 25% share price drop in the last month. For any long-term shareholders, the last month ends a year to forget by locking in a 53% share price decline.\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, you could still be forgiven for thinking GIANTSTEP is a stock not worth researching with a price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") of 2.1x, considering almost half the companies in Korea's Entertainment industry have P/S ratios below 1.5x. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the elevated P/S.\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n View our latest analysis for GIANTSTEP\nHow Has GIANTSTEP Performed Recently?\nThe revenue growth achieved at GIANTSTEP over the last year would be more than acceptable for most companies. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this respectable revenue growth will be enough to outperform the broader industry in the near future. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.\nWe don't have analyst forecasts, but you can see how recent trends are setting up the company for the future by checking out ourfree report on GIANTSTEP'searnings, revenue and cash flow.\nHow Is GIANTSTEP's Revenue Growth Trending?\nIn order to justify its P/S ratio, GIANTSTEP would need to produce impressive growth in excess of the industry.\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew revenue by an impressive 18% last year. Pleasingly, revenue has also lifted 51% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing revenue over that time.\nWeighing that recent medium-term revenue trajectory against the broader industry's one-year forecast for expansion of 16% shows it's about the same on an annualised basis.\nWith this in mind, we find it intriguing that GIANTSTEP's P/S exceeds that of its industry peers. Apparently many investors in the company are more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock right now. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as a continuation of recent revenue trends would weigh down the share price eventually.\nThe Bottom Line On GIANTSTEP's P/S\nDespite the recent share price weakness, GIANTSTEP's P/S remains higher than most other companies in the industry. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-sales ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\nOur look into GIANTSTEP has shown that it currently trades on a higher than expected P/S since its recent three-year growth is only in line with the wider industry forecast. When we see average revenue with industry-like growth combined with a high P/S, we suspect the share price is at risk of declining, bringing the P/S back in line with the industry too. Unless the recent medium-term conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks.
