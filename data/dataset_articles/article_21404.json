  "text": "Inclusivity and the environment key to Outsider Awards nominations for a Wicklow Tidy Towns group\nVolunteers from Blessington Tidy Towns received a nomination at the Outsider Awards 2023 for their commitment to fostering environmental interest and inclusivity in west Wicklow over the past year.\nAs one of 17 Wicklow nominees in this year's Outsider Awards, which celebrates the remarkable achievements of the Irish outdoor community, Blessington Tidy Towns stands out in the 'Diversity and Inclusion’ category.\nThe volunteer-led community group has made significant strides in promoting community engagement, adding to their work through well-known initiatives such as the national Tidy Towns Competition, ‘2MinuteStreetClean’, and the ‘Big Beach Clean’.\nIn recent years, the group has broadened its outreach to newer community members, including those recently relocated to the area, individuals displaced from Ukraine, and those under International Protection.\nIn 2023, the group initiated an informal English chat to encourage connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds, focusing on supporting Ukrainians, new Irish residents, and various nationalities involved in their weekly litter picks.\nSpeaking ahead of the awards night at The Sugar Club in Dublin on February 21, Jason Mulhall from Blessington Tidy Towns expressed his pride in the nomination, saying: “It is great to be nominated and recognised for the work we have done over the last year.\n“Quite a few people from the Ukrainian and other communities are working with Tidy Towns, including people from accommodation in the Avon and Kippure Lodge.\n“We’re working closely with the Volunteer Centre in Wicklow, where Fiona Downes has been putting us in touch with people who want to volunteer with us.”\nBlessington Tidy Towns collaborated with Wicklow Partnership’s SICAP Coordinator to set up the informal English classes, which have proved hugely beneficial.\n“The English classes were set up informally, with volunteers from Tidy Towns meeting in the library, breaking off into small groups, and engaging in conversations to help people with their English without creating a formal setting,” Jason explained.\n“We're also working on a new Pure Mile project where members of our Ukrainian community will take ownership of an area, and we will support them and make sure they have everything they need.\n“It is something the group can own and run with themselves, and will give them a great sense of achievement from establishing and having ownership over an initiative in the community.”\nAmong the other Blessington Tidy Towns initiatives highlighted by Outsider judges is their inspirational work with Blessington Community College in assisting in establishing a Youth Environmental Council.\n“The group has officially become a Gaisce ‘Challenge Partner,’ showcasing a particularly fruitful relationship set to continue bearing fruit,” Jason said.\n“One of the things the judges mentioned, which we are all very proud of, is the work of Blessington Community College, who have established a Youth Environmental Council and are very active.”",
