  "text": "Less generous tax cuts for higher-income earners and rising borrowing costs will push more people to negatively gear property, accountants and economists say.\nThe Albanese government will reinstate the 37 per cent tax rate for incomes above $135,000, instead of a scheduled flat 30 per cent rate for incomes between $45,000 and $200,000 under the Coalition’s previous stage three that was legislated to start in July.\nThe top income tax of 47 per cent (including 2 per cent Medicare levy) will apply to taxable incomes above $190,000, up from the current threshold of $180,000 but not going to the $200,000 previously planned.\nA person with a taxable income of $250,000 in 2024-25 will pay $78,638 in income tax , compared with $74,092 under the Coalition’s previous stage three version. They will pay $83,167 for this financial year.\nKPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said higher earners were “out of the money” compared with 2009 because the top marginal tax rate income threshold would today be the equivalent of about $260,000 if it was adjusted for inflation.\nAdvertisement “The high-taxing environment for high-income earners does promote more tax planning for investment and wealth, and it is likely to encourage negative gearing, particularly because the outlook for property prices is rosy,” he said.\n“The previous stage three of moving the top marginal tax rate band from $180,000 to $200,000 wasn’t going to fix it, but it would have helped.”\nHalf of landlords negative gear Tax Office data show that of the 2.2 million landlords in 2020-21, 47 per cent reported net rental income losses, when home loan rates dropped to as low as about 2 per cent.\nThe number of landlords reporting negative cash flow will rise this year, due to the sharp jump in interest rates increasing their borrowing expenses.\nProperty investors running their properties at an annual cash flow loss will save more than $3 billion in tax .\nAdvertisement People in management roles, including chief executives and managers in advertising and sales, IT, construction, finance, policy and planning and human resources, are the most likely to claim rental losses, according to ATO data .\nOver 50s likely to tax plan H&R Block Australia director of tax communications Mark Chapman said people earning around $200,000 would have more incentive to get their taxable income down into one of the lower rate bands via strategies including negative gearing.\n“Having said that, the changes in the tax rates are just one factor to take into account when considering negative gearing and by no means the most important one,” he said.\n“The state of the current property market, expectations of positive change and the state of your own personal finances are all more important factors.”\nKristen Sobeck, research fellow at the Australian National University’s Tax and Transfer Institute, said negative gearing was most likely to be used by higher-income earners, particularly those aged over 50 who had paid off their mortgages.\nAdvertisement “People in their 30s and 40s who have high incomes are either saving for their own home or paying off homes and have other expenses such as childcare,” she said.\n“People in their 50s and early 60s who have pretty high incomes and lower expenses could be considering it before they retire.”\nProperty analyst Louis Christopher of SQM Research said property investors deducting more interest costs would not impact property prices much. “I wouldn’t expect an immediate impact,” he said. “They get some tax back, but the interest-servicing burden has risen and increased the negative cash flow for investors.”\nIn an interview with the ABC this week, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry said landlords were not a net taxpayer on their property investments because their deductions exceeded their incomes.\nHe suggested moving to a more neutral taxation of investment gains and losses, such as the dual income tax system proposed by ANU economist Bob Breunig.\nAdvertisement Under the system used in some Scandinavian countries, a flat tax rate of, say, 15-25 per cent would be paid on most forms of non-labour investment income, such as bank interest, dividends, capital gains and net rental income.\nAny investment losses would be deductible at the same flat rate of 15-25 per cent, to ensure the gains and losses were treated evenly. Investment losses could not be offset against labour income, which would continue to be taxed at progressive rates.\nUnder current rules, negatively geared property investors can pay a negative marginal tax rate on annual rental losses and get a 50 per cent discount on any capital gains. They can deduct any losses against their other income such as wages and salaries.\nIf the property is held until the person retires, they will likely face lower tax rates on the gains.\nGreens pressure Labor The Albanese government is under pressure from the Greens to crack down on negative gearing and the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount, in return for supporting Labor to establish a shared equity home scheme to help low-income earners.\nAdvertisement Thirty-one-year-old Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather is helping the party appeal to renters and aspiring home buyers, who are generally younger and worried about housing affordability.\nGrattan Institute economist Brendan Coates said he supported the Greens’ push to reform negative gearing and the CGT discount to improve housing affordability.\n“Our work shows house prices would be 2 per cent lower than otherwise,” he said. “They won’t change house prices or rents much, but they would give a boost to homeownership.\n“They would save the budget $7 billion a year and remove incentives to speculate on property.”\nJohn Kehoe is Economics editor at Parliament House, Canberra.
