  "text": "Any evaluation of climate impact related to animal agriculture should include a recognition of the role of livestock in meeting the public's dietary needs. Dr. Frank Mitloehner joins us with an update on climate discussions and animal agriculture. February 16, 2024 Sustainable livestock systems can contribute to climate action in several ways, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improvement of resource efficiency, enhancement of carbon sequestration and minimization of environmental impacts. At the same time, there needs to be recognition of the role of livestock in meeting the public’s dietary needs. What is at stake? How important is collaboration when it comes to reducing emissions from livestock globally? Joining us on this episode of Feedstuffs in Focus is Dr. Frank Mitloehner of the University of California-Davis and the CLEAR Center. We caught up with Dr. Mitloehner during the International Production and Processing Expo in Atlanta, to get the lastest update on climate-related discussions in regard to the animal agriculture.
