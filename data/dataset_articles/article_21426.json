  "text": "The much-awaited Baagwani Mahotsava 2024, a prestigious event celebrating agriculture, is all set to grace the grounds of Gandhi Maidan, Patna, from February 16 to 18, 2024. The Directorate of Horticulture in Bihar has organized this amazing festival to bring farmers from all around the state together to honour their experience, knowledge, and contributions to the agricultural landscape. Sanjay Kumar Agrawal, Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Bihar, announced that the festival will kick off with a formal inauguration on February 16, 2024. The honour of inaugurating the event will be bestowed upon the esteemed Deputy Chief Minister cum Agriculture Minister of Bihar. Promoting Knowledge Sharing and Healthy Competition The primary objective of the Baagwani Mahotsava is to facilitate knowledge exchange and experiences among farmers. It serves as a platform to showcase various agricultural products, fostering healthy competition among participants while honouring their significant contributions to the sector. Farmers from across the state have registered in 19 different categories for the competition. These categories encompass a wide range of [agricultural products](/news/assam-exported-agricultural-products-of-rs-4000-cr-in-2022-23-says-agri-minister-atul-bora/), including vegetables, fruits, honey, ornamental plants, and even rooftop gardening photography. Additionally, there will be engaging events such as a Fancy Dress Competition and a Quiz Competition to add vibrancy to the festival. To ensure fairness, teams of scientists from specialized agricultural institutions have been entrusted with the task of transparently evaluating the exhibits in all categories. Recognition and Awards at Baagwani Mahotsava 2024 The festival will acknowledge excellence by awarding prizes in each of the 19 categories. The top three performers in each category will receive cash prizes, with the overall best-performing farmer being honoured as the ‘Best Horticulturist’ and awarded a special prize. The Baagwani Mahotsava promises something exciting for everyone, with a diverse schedule planned for each day of the event. From the formal inauguration and quiz competitions to workshops on honey and technical sessions, attendees can immerse themselves in a rich tapestry of agricultural experiences.
