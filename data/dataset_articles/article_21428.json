Now, impacted residents are continuing to recover from the damage left behind. Officials held a community meeting at Evansville High School Thursday night, giving an update on recovery efforts. One Edgerton family in attendance is looking to get their life back on track after the tornado destroyed much of their farm. “It sounded like a train ran through our house,” Gabriella Nelson said. That’s what Gabriella and her husband Ryan Nelson heard as a tornado hit their home. The aftermath left them searching for a new roof over their head. “Every day we wake up and we look outside and it’s just, it’s more than just the price tag,” Gabriella said. “It’s everything we worked for our whole life. It’s our American dream and it was gone overnight.” After the unprecedented storm ripped through their farm, the Nelson’s looked for ways to still live there and take care of their animals. They scrambled over the last week and ended up getting a mobile home. “I busted out in tears because I felt so blessed just knowing me and my kids and my husband will have somewhere safe to stay,” Gabriella said. The Nelson’s have 15 goats. Four of them are pregnant and are due within the next couple of weeks. “We were worried about the stress for them, and us being farmers, we really try to make sure our animals have the utmost care,” Gabriella said “I might not have sleep, but I want to make sure that they’re healthy and safe.” Gabriella runs a small business through her goats by making products out of goat milk. She’s unsure when it will return back to normal. “We lost all of our hay,” Gabriella said. “My business is going to be on pause for the unseeable future, knowing that we won’t have milk and supplies for that, or even a home.” The Nelsons now wait to see if their original home can be restored. They hope to have all 15 goats back on their farm soon. The other 11 are being taken care of by another person.
