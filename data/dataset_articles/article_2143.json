  "text": "AYDEN, N.C. ( WITN /Gray News) – A 93-year-old woman says she was charged $450 to change the name on her utility bill to her own after her husband died.Eleanor Boyd lives in Ayden, North Carolina. She lost her husband in February and wanted to switch the name on her utility account from her husband’s name to hers.She thought she was doing the right thing by putting the bill in her name since her husband was no longer alive. She said the bill would be for the same address; she was simply requesting a name change.When she went to Ayden Town Hall to ask to make the change, she was told there would be a $450 fee to put her name on the account.Initially, she was shocked.“I told her, ‘Well, I shouldn’t have even told you.’ And she said, ‘Well, we know now,‘” Boyd said, describing her interaction with the person at the desk.Boyd says she was told she couldn’t go back on her request to make the change since they now knew her husband had died, so she would have to foot the bill.“They were gonna cut off my lights if I didn’t pay it within 31 days,” she said.City officials said the $450 fee exists to help cover unpaid utility bills from others. The town says even with this fee, it is often not enough to cover unpaid bills, and they have to utilize a state program to help with outstanding balances.When it comes to the account of a person who has died, the town says that it must absorb any balances on that person’s account if the trustee or spouse does not pay the final bill.Boyd says that she and her husband always paid their bills on time, and she’s never received any kind of return deposit from the town following her husband’s passing.She contacted a town commissioner, who got the issue added to the next council meeting’s agenda.“When they got the meeting, they tabled it,” Boyd said.Now, it’s slated for discussion on April 14.Boyd says she’s willing to fight, and she’s not just doing it for herself. While she said she has the money to pay, she worries about those who do not.“Even though it would have been a burden to pay $450, I could have paid it. But who else are they doing it to that can’t pay it?” she said.As the clock ticks on the 31 days Boyd was given to make the payment, she knows it may get to the point where her power is shut off – a consequence she’s prepared to face.“Everything I’m doing here today is to help myself and others, and I’m just going to go to the limit,” she said.WITN reached out to other nearby towns to see if they also require the $450 name-change fee.In Farmville, if the right documentation is provided, the town manager said a name switch like this would be free. Same thing in Grifton – it would also be free.In Bethel, residents making this request are charged $5 for an administrative fee. Copyright 2025 WITN via Gray Local Media, Inc. All rights reserved.",
