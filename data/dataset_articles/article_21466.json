  "text": "Be it the depths of the ocean or the heights of a mountain, humans will litter anywhere and everywhere, often ignoring the impact it has on other creatures. Sadly, wild animals often encounter discarded plastic in their natural habitats, which poses a threat to their well-being. A video captured by wildlife photographer Deep Kathikar sheds light on the severity of this issue. The footage shows a young tiger using its mouth to remove a trashed plastic bottle from a waterhole in Maharashtra&#039;s Tadoba National Park. The tiger then proceeds to walk away with the bottle held firmly in its mouth. Many on social media have found the tiger&#039;s actions heartwarming, recognising its gesture as a thoughtful one. Since being posted, the video has garnered millions of views online. Cobra Swallows Plastic Bottle, Throws it Out After Locals Help the Snake (Watch Video).
