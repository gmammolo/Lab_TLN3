  "text": "A Dutch startup that goes by the name of 'Human Material Loop' is looking to revolutionize the textile world by going about utilizing human hair that would otherwise be discarded from barbershops and salons and re-using it for a variety of applications that range from clothing and carpets to curtains. Founded by none other than the noted designer, researcher and art lecturer Zsofia Kollar, Human Material Loop is essentially a startup that operates in the materials science space with the aim of crafting together high-performance textile and adjacent products that make use of waste human hair. Although companies operating within the wig industry have used longer strands of hair, the fact of the matter is that most hair still gets discarded despite having an array of properties that make it more than useful for upcycled applications, which is precisely what this Dutch startup is pioneering.",
