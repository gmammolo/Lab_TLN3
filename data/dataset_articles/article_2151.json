  "text": "Gainesville\nOuch! Florida Fan Falls From Street Light And Hits Ground Months After Another Fan Died Pulling Same Stunt\nBy Warren Loukota,\n15 minutes agoThat's gonna leave a mark! A Florida fan got a little bit too into his celebration after they won the tournament. After climbing up a telephone pole, the pole in question fell. Unsurprisingly taking its rider with it. I can't believe we almost had a repeat of the drama with the Philly celebration.",
