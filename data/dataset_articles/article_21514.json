  "text": "2024-02-16 05:22:00\nIt was Carinne Gresse who decided to create a refuge for foxes, Clos des Renardises in Douzillac.\nFounded on January 15, 2020 by Carine Gresse, the founding president and holder of the Red Fox Capacity Certificate and by extension weasel, ermine, marten, marten, skunk, badger and raccoon, the refuge “Le clos des foxises” welcomes foxes who are forced into captivity. The idea of this refuge is not to act as a zoo, but to offer a place of protection for these animals.\nThe refuge will not be open to the public to leave the foxes alone, but you can find Carine Gresse’s photos on her\nsite internet.\n1708061452\n#clos #des #foxises #takes #care #refuge #foxes\nRelated posts:\n\"STRICT-G\" Hong Kong Limited Store Landed at K11, a variety of Gundam trendy apparels one by one-Hon...
