(KOLO) - Nicholas Loving had his bail set at $10 million during a court hearing on Wednesday.\nLoving did not appear in court, opting instead to have his legal team argue in his defense during the proceedings.\nHis bail was set as cash only.\nDuring the hearing, it was agreed that, should Loving make bail, he would have a GPS mandate to stay within Washoe County, and have no contact with his four children and wife.\nHe was also deemed a flight risk.\nCopyright 2025 KOLO.
