  "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) — Part of some new funding from President Biden's Investing in America plan will create new jobs and clean up toxic sites here in Central Illinois. The state will be getting $75 million. Some of the money will be used for Lutheran High School. We took a tour of the inside and got a look at the damage from mine subsidence. \"This funding is a lifeline,\" Natalie Finnie, Illinois Department of Natural Resources Director, said. Illinois will receive $75 million to help with projects and properties across the state that are affected by mine subsidence. Lutheran High School will receive some of the funding. \"Subsidence has caused severe damage to the building, as many of you just saw, causing buckling and floors and ceilings and causing the ground to drop nearly two feet in just two weeks. Most of that happening in one day,\" Steve Feldgus, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management, said. In 2022, school staff began noticing evidence of mine subsidence in the building that resulted in damage. Since then, the school has relocated. Officials said the original building is a public safety risk. \"None of this takes away the sting of being uprooted from the school you love and holds precious memories. Lutheran High is very much a part of the fabric of Springfield,\" Finnie said. Officials are not sure yet how much money will be allocated to the high school. But they said for all projects related to this funding, more jobs will be created and it will help protect the environment. \"The reality is that legacy pollution continues to pollute to any of our waterways, our neighborhoods, our community spaces and we can't look away any longer,\" Feldgus said. Officials also visited the Peabody #10 site outside of Pawnee on Thursday. The money is being used to fix acid mine drainage and other public safety hazards. Officials said the goal is to complete 81 projects estimated to cost about $68 million over the next five years.",
