  "text": "2024-02-16 06:14:48 With a special badge of honor “For sailing in the Southern Ocean”, the leadership of the Higher Naval School (VVMU) “N.Y. Vaptsarov” awarded three Bulgarian Antarctic explorers for their contribution to the expeditions to the Ice Continent. The head of the National Antarctic Expedition and director of the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute (BAI) Prof. Hristo Pimpirev, the Bulgarian ambassador to Argentina Stoyan Mihailov and the general director of the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency Kiril Valchev were honored. The badges of honor were presented by the head of VVMU “N. Y. Vaptsarov” Fleet Admiral Prof. Boyan Mednikarov, Ph.D. The ceremony took place today on board the military scientific research ship “St. St. Cyril and Methodius” (NIK 421). “Years ago, when the Bulgarian Navy participated in the squadrons of the United Black Sea Fleet in the Mediterranean and our ships sailed to Cape Mattapan (the southernmost point of the Mani Peninsula, Greece – note ed.) and to the east of it, the participants in these “On the ships, officers, officers and sailors wore a special badge called “za dalniy pokhod” (from Russian – “for a long journey”). It was a distinction for a sailor who went very far,” said Fleet Admiral Prof. Mednikarov. Last year, in connection with the first successful mission of NIK 421 in the Atlantic Ocean, a similar badge called “For sailing in the Southern Ocean” was created by my order, explained the head of the Military Academy of Military Academy. According to him, the badge has two statuses – operational and honorary. “The operational status is associated with awarding it to any member of the crew of a ship that has successfully crossed the Drake Passage and reached Antarctica. It is given to people who have proven themselves to be true sailors. Honorary status is associated with the contribution of those involved in making of Antarctic research activities,” the admiral said. By order of Prof. Mednikarov, senior assistant commander of NIK 421, Radko Muevski announced the honorary winners of the “For sailing in the Southern Ocean” badge.

Adm. Mednikarov joked with the head of the Bulgarian Antarctic expedition that he could wear the badge on both the winter and summer uniform. Ambassador Mihailov accepted the badge saying that the award is for everyone because it is a great collective effort. According to Kiril Valchev, the ship “St. St. Cyril and Methodius” celebrates one of its name days – Assumption of St. Constantine-Cyril the Philosopher. “In his life there are several moments related to ships”. The general director of BTA talked about the travels of St. Cyril the Philosopher and the conversation with the Byzantine emperor. “When Basileus sent him, St. Cyril said to him: “I will go on foot and barefoot, because the Lord said to free ourselves from everything”, but the emperor said to him: “When you represent the dignity of our kingdom, you cannot go like this . You must be sent off with dignity.” By ship, St. Cyril discovered in Kherson the relics of one of the first popes, the successor of St. Apostle Peter, Kiril Valchev also said. “The holy learned theologian says that the Lord is like a boundless sea. Those people with sense can pass it successfully, and those without sense either sink or save themselves with great difficulty”. Bulgaria reached Antarctica in a dignified way, Kiril Valchev added. “Here we are an example that when there is a desire among Bulgarian Antarctic scientists, Bulgaria can be part of the most advanced nations in the world for Antarctic research”. The director general of the national information agency wished the Antarctic missions of the crew of the military scientific research ship “St. St. Cyril and Methodius”, writes BTA.",
