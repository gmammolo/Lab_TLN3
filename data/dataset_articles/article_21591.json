  "text": "Best Overall\nProduct Specs\n- Type: Ready-to-use spray\n- Quantity: 16 ounces\n- Active ingredients: Peppermint oil, geraniol\nPros\n- An effective plant-based product made with U.S.-sourced peppermint\n- Long-lasting concentrated formula in easy-to-use spray bottle\n- Works as both an indoor and outdoor spider repellent when applied regularly\nCons\n- Although safe when dry, it should never be sprayed on or near dogs and cats\nMany people like the smell of peppermint, but spiders do not. This plant-based repellent spray from Mighty Mint is made up of 3 percent U.S.-sourced peppermint and 1 percent geraniol, the main component of citronella oil. It can be sprayed on plants, hard surfaces, and most fabrics (though we recommend testing a patch first).\nWhen using it as an indoor spider repellent, users will want to apply it once a week. It will also work outdoors in sheltered areas. Mighty Mint states that its spider repellent is safe when used as directed. Be cautious, though: Like some other insect repellents, peppermint oil can cause respiratory distress in some children and is toxic for many pets, so apply it judiciously.\nGet the Mighty Mint spider repellent at\nAmazon, Walmart, or Target.",
