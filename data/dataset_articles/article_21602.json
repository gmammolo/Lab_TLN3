  "text": "Scientists create 'meaty' rice for eco-friendly protein Korean scientists have invented a new hybrid food, consisting of beef muscle and fat cells grown inside grains of rice What happened? Korean scientists said Wednesday they've invented a new hybrid food, consisting of beef muscle and fat cells grown inside grains of rice. The experimental \"meaty\" rice was developed to be an affordable and [eco-friendly](https://theweek.com/environment/climate-friendly-beef-is-another-instance-of-greenwashing) source of protein. Who said what? Integrating animal cells into rice could eventually \"ensure a sufficient food supply\" for \"underdeveloped countries, during war, and in space,\" said the researchers at [South Korea's Yonsei University](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S259023852400016X#:~:text=The%20findings%20of%20this%20study,during%20war%2C%20and%20in%20space.). The commentary The \"microbeef,\" as the researchers call it, \"seems to be an early success\" nutritionally and maybe taste-wise, too, Ed Cara said at [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/scientists-create-beef-infused-rice-with-cow-cells-1851255552). Its \"odor profile\" indicates a \"rich flavor\" with \"notes of beef and almond.\" Subscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But \"while data on cost and climate impact look very positive, a critical test is around public appetite for these sorts of lab-developed foods.\" Create an account with the same email registered to your subscription to unlock access.
