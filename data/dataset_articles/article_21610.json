  "text": "A quick look at my calendar and the anticipation is building! It’s coming soon, my favorite day of the year: Valentine’s Day, this wonderful day when I can compensate for my love for my wife with chocolates and flowers. How wonderful. It truly touches my heart how advertising reminds us every year that our love is only truly worth anything if we spend our hard-earned money on flowers, chocolate and cards. Why do I need real feelings when I can buy them with an expensive box of chocolates? Practical thing. Santa Claus out, hearts in As soon as Santa Claus has disappeared from the shelves, they are filled with heart-shaped things. Thank you advertising industry, where would I be without you? I could practically pack my bags straight away. At least that’s what it suggests to me. The social pressure to give something to your partner makes it difficult for me to walk upright. If I don’t hand over at least a box of chocolates or a huge, overpriced rose, then I’ll be labeled a heartless chauvinist. Pah, the true feelings I have for my wife are pure beauty. Well, end of irony. Why I won’t give anything away this year either For my part, I definitely won’t be giving anything away this year either. Why? I love surprising my wife every day of the year. I show her my love every day, sometimes with roses. I find this capitalist idea of only showing your love on a certain day of the year completely absurd anyway. My dear ones, enjoy Valentine’s Day, but don’t forget that true love does not depend on material things, but on the small gestures and the time we spend with each other.",
