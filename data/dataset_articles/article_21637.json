  "text": "Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter pollution. This is critical, because too many people live with unhealthy levels of particle pollution — more than 18.8 million people — according to the American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” report. These new rules will mean that polluting industries will have to use modern pollution controls to reduce their air pollution. Because of this, many of these big industries are pushing back with false and misleading claims about these lifesaving standards. The bottom line is that stronger particle pollution standards will save lives. Building on this victory, there is much more work to do to ensure clean air for Pennsylvania’s residents. Please join me as I call on President Biden: Don’t Delay, Clean Air Today. Dr. Deborah Gentile Johnstown (The writer is a Cambria County Lung Association Local Leadership board member.)",
