  "text": "SEYI TAIWO-OGUNTUASE\nWith the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Cashewnut Association of Cambodia and the African Cashew Alliance (ACA), it is expected that Africa will be able to double its production and productivity in five years.\nTola Faseru, President of ACA who led Africa to the signing in Siem Reap, Cambodia said that the collaboration covers cashew growth and development, covering areas of research, science and technology sharing and transfer, training and exchange of scientists between cashew producing countries in Africa and Cambodia.\nCambodia is the second largest supplier of Cashew in the world, with the world best quality and yield per hectare.\nAt present, Africa produces about 60 percent of the world total raw cashew output.\nFaseru, who is also the Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Osun State, Nigeria explained that the African production figure stands at 2.8 million metric tonnes with Ivory Coast taking the lead with 1.2 million metric tonnes, followed by Nigeria with 320,000 metric tonnes and Tanzania in the third position with production of 270,000 metric tonnes.\nREAD ALSO: AFEX Announces Planting Of 1 Million Cocoa Trees For Production, Sustainability In Nigeria\nHe said that the collaboration will bring the production level to about five million tonnes, that the productivity per hectare will increase from the present 400 – 500kg per hectare to two metric tonnes per hectare.\n“The quality bar is expected to increase from 51 kor to 54kor. All of these mean increase in yield and increase in farmer income and improved livelihood. This also will help Africa prepare for more raw cashew nuts needed to feed the increasing processing capacity both in Africa and the world at large.\nHe noted that the collaboration is in order for Africa to achieve great heights in its economy, that agriculture is the low hanging fruit and upscaling its output is key and the very strategic option to take.\nHe said this is in tandem with the economics of scale principle, that the implication is that the research institutes and other cashew organisations in Africa can ride on the MOU.",
