  "text": "Miracles in nature Nature has a way to make long-distance trips enjoyable, whether it is cloud-formation, natural beauty or forest placement. Some years ago, we were traveling to Colorado. We saw some pretty interesting scenes on the way. Near the west corner of the Kansas border there was one, lonely, scrub-tree. Halfway up this twenty-foot twisted specimen, the constant wind had bent it forty five degrees to the East. For additional viewing, on the west side the bark was dead and the inner wood was bleached white, but the East aside was still alive. It was an amazing sight. How could it live in that condition, half alive and half dead? I wondered how much longer it would remain: would another trip out west see this tree gone? In this state the wind is a constant pressure, never allowing trees, any way to protect themselves. It stands there all alone with no others to help reduce its stress. As I pondered this view, the tree reminded me of some present day churches who are living under similar conditions. In Scripture, God warns us about weak faith or allowing our spiritual life to be crowded out by worldly living. Christians are encouraged to put watchtowers over our lives; we are to take the goodness of life and allow the bad to go on its way. This tree did not have any opportunity to protect itself and unless someone intervened with help, it would just die. In all respects that is the end result of human life that hasn’t reached out for help. Scripture says if we do not protect our God-given Spiritual life it will be like the “soon to die scrub.” How do we protect ourselves? Jesus tells us that our lives must be pruned as a Gardener would care for an olive tree. The Holy Spirit would give every opportunity for growth to happen. We are to do the same to our lives. Feed it the richness of Scripture and give it a daily portion of true belief. That is my story and I am sticking with it. “Keep on keeping on” and trust in the goodness of God. Blessings to you all.",
