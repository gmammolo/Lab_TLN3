  "text": "The United Nations recently designated Pakistan’s Living Indus Initiative as one of its seven World Restoration Flagship programmes. This significant recognition, announced by the UN Environment Programme, marks a pivotal moment for Pakistan’s environmental efforts, specifically targeted at revitalising the Indus River Basin. The Indus River Basin, one of Pakistan’s most critical water systems, has been facing extensive ecological challenges. Recognising the urgency of the situation, the project was initially developed as a comprehensive strategy aimed at safeguarding, preserving and rehabilitating the diverse natural ecosystems found within the Indus Basin. The scope of the project is ambitious, with plans to restore 25 million hectares of the river basin by 2030, which constitutes over 30% of Pakistan’s land area. Such a wide-reaching endeavour requires substantial financial and technical support, estimated to cost up to $17 billion. This is where the designation as a World Restoration Flagship programme is critical, as it opens avenues for additional UN assistance to bolster the initiative’s implementation. The holistic approach, incorporating community-led, gender-responsive and transparent nature-based solutions, presents a unique opportunity to enhance the resilience of the Indus ecosystem. By actively involving international groups, the initiative can help empower local communities, those directly affected by environmental changes, and bring about tangible change amid a tough economic situation. The recognition of Living Indus project as a World Restoration Flagship is not only a testament to the country’s commitment to environmental stewardship but also a step forward in addressing the interconnected challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. It is now imperative to ensure that the project receives the necessary support and resources to achieve its ambitious goals and contribute to the global efforts towards ecosystem restoration.
