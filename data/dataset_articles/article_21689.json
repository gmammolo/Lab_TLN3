  "text": "In recent times, Morocco has been struggling with the drought, the water crisis and the scarcity of rainfall, which it has so far managed to contain. The serenity and clarity with which Rabat is anticipating the consequences of climate change is in the focus of several governments, not only for its neighbouring countries, but also for those nations that foresee that they may suffer the same consequences in a short period of time. ; The Moroccan media Rue20 advanced that the Government's intentions, in view of the success of the first project of the motorway linking the Sebou River with the El Bouregreg basin, is to link the Oued El Makhzen dam with the port of El Boughaz Fadil, Tangier, in order to supply one of the most densely populated cities in the country. Morocco inaugurates the first water highway Several ministerial departments and territorial councils have indicated that they have initiated effective measures to deal with the serious shortage of drinking water in the region of Tangier, which the Ministry of Resources and Water Supply classifies as \"one of the regions most affected by the serious water situation\". The regional official explained that the Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken an urgent project to connect several basins. ; ; ; Among the measures taken by the government are the construction and activation of desalination plants - some of which run on energy generated by photovoltaic parks - the development of modern irrigation systems to reduce water wastage, protection from possible floods and the construction of a national hydrographic plan for the relocation of resources - water - across the national holography to supply the country's main cities, in this case, Tangier, according to the Moroccan media. Morocco articulates a major plan to tackle drought problem Within the framework of the urgent measures to find the necessary solutions to manage the North African country's water vulnerability crisis, the regional officials pointed out that the Ministry of Equipment and Water has accelerated the actions to complete the sea desalination project. ; Nizar Baraka, Minister of Equipment and Water of Morocco ;- PHOTO/ATALAYAR/GUILLERMO LÓPEZ At the same time, the Ministry of Defence has set a deadline of three months to complete the studies related to its completion, noting that the project is located on a beach adjacent to the Diplomatic Forest southwest of Tangier, stressing that it is the only one of its kind, contrary to what was revealed in previous reports, which indicated that the government's plans were the creation of 3 desalination plants. ; Plan of the project to link the Sebou and Bourgreg rivers by means of canals known as \"water highways\" ;- PHOTO/SOMAGECGROUPE Morocco has recently increased investment in desalination projects as it struggles to maintain water security. The country has allocated 383 billion dirhams (37.6 billion dollars) over 30 years to improve domestic and agricultural water infrastructure as part of a comprehensive 2020-2050 plan. ; Desalination projects also include installing a desalination plant on the Atlantic coast, building a wastewater treatment plant on the Mediterranean coast and upgrading desalination technology in northern Morocco. Undertaking these investments and initiatives will help improve the quality of our country's water and provide reliable water to our citizens. It is a testament to the effectiveness of the Moroccan government that it continues to seek new solutions to water problems. In addition to the proposal, one of Rabat's projects is the reuse of agricultural wastewater. ;",
