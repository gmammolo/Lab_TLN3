The certification ensures that our drone operations comply with aviation regulations. It will also elevate our research and engineering efforts and service delivery.’ ‘The Western Cape Government has taken up innovation and technology to improve service delivery to the citizens of the Western Cape. The latest aviation certification allows us to bring another innovative dimension to the agricultural sector and improve service delivery to our agricultural industries.
