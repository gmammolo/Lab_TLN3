  "text": "© Diana Hoffmann / RTL Archiv\nBereldange is now equipped with state-of-the-art charging stations, offering rapid charging capabilities for electric vehicles, courtesy of SWIO.\nThese charging stations boast an output of 400 kilowatt-hours (kWh). While currently, there are no cars capable of fully utilising this capacity, the imminent launch of the first model designed to accommodate over 320 kW is anticipated in the coming months. Additionally, vehicles capable of charging at 350 kW are expected to hit the market soon, as highlighted by Alex Michels, COO at Losch.\nLocated adjacent to a large car dealership in Bereldange, the charging station can also simultaneously charge two modern electric cars at 200 kW each, enabling a swift charge from 10 to 80% within just 20 minutes.\nRegarding the pricing structure, Michels outlined the company's role as a \"charge point operator,\" indicating that the charging stations will be made available to card operators at a designated price for their respective customers. Although the exact pricing is yet to be determined, Michels estimates it to be around 55 cents per kW.\nIn addition to the 400-kW charging station, a 320-kW station was also inaugurated, highlighting the significant electrical capacity facilitated by these installations. However, concerns about the strain on the power grid in Bereldange are unfounded, as the location was chosen in consultation with the electricity grid operator, emphasised Frank Wies from Socom.\nMinister of the Economy Lex Delles expressed his satisfaction with this latest development in favour of electromobility, noting the financial support provided by both the state and the EU for the construction of these charging stations. Delles also highlighted the ongoing efforts to expand charging infrastructure, with over 1,200 charging points defined in three tenders to date, and a fourth tender currently underway until March. There are currently over 2,000 charging points in Luxembourg.\nFull report by RTL Télé (in Luxembourgish)",
