  "text": "Save Elephant Foundation Rescue: NamThip coming to Elephant Nature Park soon\nGood news update from Save Elephant Foundation & Elephant Nature Park founder\nSaengduean Lek Chailert\nThis young female elephant, NamThip, led a nomadic life with her mahout as a beggar on the streets of Thailand after being separated from her mother as a child.\nHer distressing journey gained attention from Thai animal lovers when an unfortunate incident occurred in Suphanburi Province. Subsequently, she faced severe punishment and suffered from inadequate care, resulting in emaciation that aged her beyond her 13 years.\nNamThip’s physical and mental state has deeply saddened elephant enthusiasts. After several days of effort, we successfully convinced the owner to release her.\nWe plan to relocate NamThip from the North East of Thailand to Northern Thailand at Elephant Nature Park soon.\nWhile awaiting government authorization for transportation, NamThip will undergo a health check by a veterinarian. The government will request necessary documents for transporting elephants, including checking identification documents and conducting a microchip examination, which takes several days.\nWe are committed to expediting NamThip’s release and will provide updates on the travel schedule.\nStay tuned for updates.",
