  "text": "Ru Cha is a rare and precious primary mangrove forest in Tam Giang lagoon, located in Thuan Hoa village, Huong Phong commune of Hue City. The name is originally from the tree type that grows in the place: a forest (RÚ) planted with trees named CHÁ; the tree has a favourable water environment here, it thrives, turning it into a forest, and only allows some species to live. Since then, the name RÚ CHÁ was born.\nTo get to Ru Cha, visitors should depart from the centre of Hue City, following National Road 49 to the direction of Thuan An beach, about 9 km. There should be a sign directing vehicles to go straight to Thuan An beach, then turn left and cross Tam Giang bridge, and Ru Cha is about 4km to reach. Ru Cha mangrove forest is extremely easy to access. Visitors can rent a car or travel by their own vehicle. Ideally, go to Ru Cha forest early in the morning and participate in activities, then rest, enjoy delicious seafood dishes around.\nRu Cha is “one of a kind” mangrove forest that exists in the Tam Giang lagoon system and each season, the mangrove forest has its own colour, sometimes it is green, sometimes it is dyed yellow to signal autumn, sometimes it’s covered in white when the leaves fall.\nRu Cha Forest in autumn is one of the most romantic destinations in Hue. Visitors who wish to admire the wild beauty and captivating golden autumn landscape, visit Ru Cha from the end of September through October. During this time, Ru Cha mangrove forest is covered with a brilliant array of yellow leaves, serving to create a peaceful scene for visitors to enjoy. Fall foliage in Ru Cha mangrove forest turns the place into a brilliant picture of autumn.\nActivities for the visitors in Ru Cha forest\nTrekking through the forest\nSummer is a perfect time for a leisure walk through the forest. Family and friends can also cycle along the path through the mangroves. Under the golden sunshine of summer, the whole place is much the opposite in winter. Slender Cha trees with large, long roots, embrace the smooth paved road. The grey-white colour of the trees interlace with rays of sunshine, fresh air, give visitors a feeling of relaxation and a peace in mind.\nFree your soul on the boat\nGoing all the way through the forest, a Ru Cha with an immense river, a large lake of fish, shrimp and aquaculture ponds appears. Riding on a small wooden boat is the most popular way to explore Ru Cha. Visitors can rent a boat and the boatman will take you to explore every nook and cranny. Venturing through clusters of towering mangroves, capturing gorgeous autumn scenery, with its soft colours and tranquil atmosphere. The boat lazily flows in the lake. A whole area turns quiet enough to hear the chirping of birds and sometimes fish darting under the water.\nRu Cha Forest is also the paradise to nature lovers since it is a home to thousands of species of flora and fauna. The sound of birdsong, insects and aquatic animals plays a soothing symphony that encapsulates the vibrant life of the forest.\nEnjoy gorgeous view from the observatory\nIn recent years, Ru Cha has caught the attention of many photographers and growing numbers of visitors show up to enjoy the mesmerising colours of the forest. The roads leading to here have been upgraded and a small observation deck has been built to give visitors a panoramic view of Ru Cha from above.\nFrom dusk til’ dawn, Ru Cha unfolds like a golden carpet with the hues of the golden leaves changing as the sun gradually rises and sets.",
