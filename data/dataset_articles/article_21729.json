  "text": "Governor Kathy Hochul revealed that the Environmental Facilities Corporation Board of Directors has approved more than $49 million in financial assistance for water infrastructure projects across New York State. This initiative, fueled by both state and federal funds, including over $20 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aims to modernize critical drinking and sewer systems in various regions, enhancing water quality and supporting economic development. Among the local projects was $804,655 short-term interest-free financing and $2,100,000 grant from BIL general supplemental funds, and an $804,655 WIIA grant from Environmental Bond Act funds for the planning, design, and construction of improvements to the town of Lyon’s wastewater treatment plant. This funding is part of New York State’s ongoing commitment to ensuring clean, safe water for its communities, contributing to healthy living environments and sustainable infrastructure development. The initiative underscores the state’s leadership in investing in water quality and infrastructure, promising long-term benefits for New Yorkers across the state. FingerLakes1.com is the region’s leading all-digital news publication. The company was founded in 1998 and has been keeping residents informed for more than two decades. Have a lead?
