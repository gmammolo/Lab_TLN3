  "text": "[CRN](https://robbreport.com/tag/crn/)’s [superyacht](https://robbreport.com/tag/superyacht/) [Comfortably Numb](https://www.crn-yacht.com/en-us/News-and-events/Detail/t/MY-Comfortably-Numb-is-the-perfect-blend-of/n/2289) has a lot in common with Pink Floyd’s 1979 hit: It’s epic, powerful, and totally unique. The bespoke 197-footer was actually delivered in December 2022, but the Italian yard released all the juicy details regarding the build on Wednesday. Comfortably Numb was designed by the Italian architects at Nuvolari Lenard and handcrafted by the team at CRN’s superyacht yard in Ancona, Italy. As such, the vessel showcases true made in Italy flair and finesse. Comfortably Numb was developed for “expert owners” who wanted a high-performance displacement vessel capable of traversing the globe. To that end, the all-aluminum cruiser has a draft of under eight feet that allows it to cruise in the shallow waters of the Caribbean, for instance. (For comparison’s sake, 200-foot steel superyacht, like say, [Majestic](https://www.merlewood.com/luxury-yacht-for-sale-52676/majestic-yacht-specs), has a draft of around 11 feet.) It also meets the rigorous IMO Tier-III emissions standards, meaning it can cruise in protected waters. To meet the exacting weight and speed requirements stipulated by the owner, CRN also incorporated innovative technologies and materials into the design. The Italian yard created a system of precise strain gauges, for example, that constantly monitor the vessel’s weight and center of gravity via Wi-Fi. The team also opted to use lightweight cork during the application and leveling of the teak decking rather than other higher-density alternatives. As a result, the yacht has a lower fighting weight and is faster on the waves. Comfortably Numb is also the first CRN fleet member to be equipped with two MTU 20V 4000 M93L engines. This setup allows the yacht to reach a top speed of over 25 knots and a cruising speed of 22.5 knots. In addition, a SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system ensures bump-free jaunts. Comfortably Numb has a distinctive stylistic identity like her namesake, too. Inspired by automotive design, the 197-footer showcases long, sleek lines and a sharp, pointed bow. “The sculpted silhouette and bold exterior styling are eye-catching even from a distance, breathing life into a one-of-a-kind, full-custom icon,” CRN said in a statement. The light-filled interior is characterized by soaring ceilings and large floor-to-ceiling windows that provide sweeping ocean views. Spanning five decks, the yacht can accommodate up to 12 guests across six suites and 13 crew. She also has generous living areas and an outdoor Jacuzzi. Pink Floyd would be proud.",
