  "text": "During a recorded address at the International Energy Agency's ministerial meeting, Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi advocated for an expanded role for India in the global energy and climate arena. Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi highlighted India's unique strengths, emphasizing the nation's \"scale and speed, quantity and quality\" and the inclusive contributions of its 1.4 billion people. He proudly stated that India has surpassed its Paris climate targets ahead of schedule, showcasing its commitment to addressing global environmental challenges. Despite being the third-largest oil consumer and a significant coal user, India achieved emissions intensity-related targets 11 years ahead of schedule and non-fossil fuel targets nine years early, setting a net-zero emissions goal for 2070. In recognizing India's global standing, Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi pointed out that the country, home to 17% of the global population, accounts for only 4% of global carbon emissions. He highlighted India's impressive economic and renewable energy growth, with plans to further reduce emissions intensity and increase non-fossil fuel-based energy resources. The Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, also emphasized India's proactive role in initiatives like the International Solar Alliance and Mission LiFE, focusing on fostering a pro-planet lifestyle.
