  "text": "Eskom eases load shedding to stage 2 Updated | By Mmangaliso Khumalo Eskom, on Friday morning, eased load shedding to stage 2. Eskom, on Friday morning, eased load shedding to stage 2. The lower stage of power cuts will be in place from 10 am on Friday. On Monday, Eskom announced a reduction in planned power cuts from stage 5 to stages 3 and 4. “The return of additional generating units, adequate emergency reserves, and anticipated lower electricity demand necessitate the reduction of load shedding to stage 2 from 10:00 today until further notice,” said Eskom spokesperson Daphne Mokwena. “Eskom will closely monitor the power system and communicate any significant changes as they occur.” ALSO READ: Show's Stories - [Cute video of parents still in love after 37 years](https://www.jacarandafm.com/shows/workzone-elana-afrika-bredenkamp/cute-video-parents-still-love-after-37-years/) When love is pure, it lasts forever...The Workzone with Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp an hour ago - [Little kid celebrates her brown skin](https://www.jacarandafm.com/shows/workzone-elana-afrika-bredenkamp/little-kid-celebrates-her-brown-skin/) What a beautiful sight to see...The Workzone with Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp an hour ago",
