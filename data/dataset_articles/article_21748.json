  "text": "CHARLESTON – Applications are now available for the 2024 West Virginia Make It Shine Statewide Spring Cleanup. This annual event is sponsored by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s (WVDEP) Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan (REAP) program. This year's cleanup will be held during the first two weeks of April (April 1-April 14) and applications are due by Friday, March 8. The Make It Shine program will provide resources such as cleanup materials, waste hauling and landfill fees to community groups volunteering to conduct litter cleanups in state streams or on public lands. Applications are available online. Once your project is approved, REAP staff will coordinate delivery of cleanup supplies, waste hauling and disposal. For more information, contact Chris Cartwright at [DEPwvmis@wv.gov](mailto:DEPwvmis@wv.gov) or by phone at 1-800-322-5530. This event is completely dependent on volunteers, so sign up today and help make West Virginia shine. REAP, whose motto is \"Keeping WV Clean and Green,\" was created in 2005 and strives to clean up West Virginia and rid the state of litter. The program empowers citizens to take ownership of their communities by providing technical, financial and resource assistance in cleanup and recycling efforts. More information is available on the REAP webpage.",
