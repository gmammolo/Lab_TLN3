  "text": "World Pangolin Day is an annual event celebrated on the third Saturday of February around the globe. This year, World Pangolin Day 2024 will be celebrated on Saturday, February 17. The day is dedicated to raising awareness about pangolins and their conservation. Pangolins are unique mammals known for their distinctive scales and are often referred to as ‘scaly anteaters’. Unfortunately, their number has been decreasing over the years as they are also one of the most trafficked mammals in the world due to illegal wildlife trade, primarily by demand for their scales and meat in traditional Asian medicine and for their supposed culinary delicacy. As World Pangolin Day 2024 nears, here’s all you need to know about the history and significance of the day. [Don’t Hate Bats and Pangolins!
