  "title": "Groundbreaking: Scout Motors gets rolling on $2B electric vehicle plant in Blythewood",
  "text": "BLYTHEWOOD — Officials broke ground at Scout Motors, a $2 billion electric vehicle plant poised to bring 4,000 new jobs to Richland County, on Feb. 15.\n\"We took a lot of looks around this great country, and the answer was quite clear. And that's why we're here in Blythewood, and that's why we're here in South Carolina,\" Scout's CEO Scott Keogh said.\nWhile no hard hats were donned or shovels dug into the ground, state leaders and top representatives from Scout celebrated the kickoff of construction the morning of Feb. 15.\nThe project, set to take up 1,100 acres of the 1,600-acre Blythewood Industrial Site just off of Interstate 77, is the Midlands' largest economic development boon in recent years. The company estimates that construction on the site will require anywhere from 5,000 to 6,000 workers to see it to completion.\nA separate exit will be added to I-77, paving a direct path to the plant from the busy interstate, officials announced Feb. 15. The new road will be named Scout Motors Drive. The hope is that the new road will deter traffic congestion on the existing Blythewood Road, which leads to the plant.\nThe groundbreaking ceremony comes a little over a month after crews were\ngiven the go-ahead to continue clearing land at the site through a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nThe EV plant is a part of a growing push by state officials to make South Carolina a leader in electric vehicle manufacturing.\nWhen it announced in March of last year, Scout, a Volkswagen subsidiary, was the fifth auto plant to build electric vehicles in the state — joining Mercedes-Benz Vans, Volvo Cars and its Polestar subsidiary, and BMW. Battery manufacturers for those vehicles, like\nChina-based Envision AESC in Florence and e-Vac Magnetics in Sumter, are set to open in the coming years.\n\"It's hard to believe that a year ago a few of us were locked down in a closed-room session trying to figure out how we could be competitive for this Scout facility ... now, a year later, you look around and see all the work that's going on,\" state Secretary of Commerce Harry Lightsey said.\nThe small town of Blythewood in South Carolina's Midlands region beat out some 70 other locations competing for the plant.\nThe state pulled out all the stops to bring the company to Blythewood, including a state-record $1.3 billion incentive package and inviting the company's officials to a party at Williams-Brice Stadium, where the University of South Carolina Gamecocks play football. Part of those incentives include a child care credit for the company, which will mean workers at the plant receive free child care.",
