  "text": "Dragged Into Sunlight issue statement regarding kicking Meth. off upcoming tour, share replacements\nEarlier this week, Chicago, IL experimental metal outfit Meth. announced they had been kicked off the upcoming North American tour as support for Dragged Into Sunlight for previously being on Prosthetic Records.\nDragged Into Sunlight have since addressed why Meth. were removed:\nUSA and Canada 2025 tour update including new dates in Minneapolis and Vegas. All dates with Mizmor except highlighted and select dates with new fellow aural punishers Glassing, Minsk, Chained to the Bottom of the Ocean and Rabbit.\nMeth will no longer be opening the tour due to an oversight by our small team. Although they parted ways with their label a few days ago, their records are still actively being sold and distributed, which conflicts with our position. We raised concerns early on, but unfortunately they were not acknowledged. We had a chat with the band and afterwards, it did not feel right.\nWe choose who we work with and it feels like a fairly basic artistic freedom to be able to do so.\nMoving on, we are looking forward to the tour. We added some killer artists who we know better and who like and respect us as much as we like and respect them.\nDragged Into Sunlight also announced that Glassing, Minsk, Chained To The Bottom of The Ocean and Rabbit will now be support on select dates along with the addition of dates in Minneapolis, MN on May 25th and Las Vegas, NV on June 1st.\n05/24 Baltimore, MD @ Maryland Death Fest (DIS only)\n05/25 Minneapolis, MN @ The Lyric at Skyway Theatre (DIS only)\n05/27 Seattle, WA @ El Corazon *\n05/28 Vancouver, BC @ Rickshaw Theatre *\n05/29 Portland, OR @ Star Theatre *\n05/30 Oakland, CA @ New Parish *\n05/31 Los Angeles, CA @ Regent Theatre *\n06/01 Las Vegas, NV @ The Usual Place (w/ Glassing only)\n06/02 Salt Lake City, UT @ Aces High Saloon *\n06/03 Denver, CO @ Marquis Theatre ^\n06/04 Omaha, NE @ Reverb Lounge ^\n06/05 Chicago, IL @ Sleeping Village ^\n06/06 Indianapolis, IN @ Black Circle ^\n06/07 Detroit, MI @ Sanctuary #\n06/08 Grand Rapids, MI @ Pyramid Scheme !\n06/09 Toronto, ON @ Lee's Palace #\n06/10 Montreal, QC @ Foufounes Electriques #\n06/11 New York, NY @ Le Poisson Rouge %\n06/12 Brattleboro, VT @ The Stone Church %\n06/13 Philadelphia, PA @ Concourse %\n06/14 Providence, RI @ Alchemy %\n*= w/ Mizmor and Glassing\n^= w/ Mizmor and Minsk\n#= w/ Mizmor and Chained To The Bottom of the Ocean\n!= w/ Minsk and Chained To The Bottom of the Ocean\n%= w/ Mizmor and Rabbit\n 1 Comment",
