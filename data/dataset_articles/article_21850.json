  "text": "Feb 16, 2024, 02:31 PM IST Camels: Camels are well-adapted to desert environments and can withstand extremely high temperatures due to their ability to conserve water and regulate body temperature. Fennec Foxes: These small foxes are native to the Sahara Desert and have large ears that help dissipate heat, allowing them to thrive in hot environments. Desert Tortoises: Desert tortoises are able to survive in hot desert climates by burrowing underground to escape the heat during the hottest parts of the day. Kangaroo Rats: Kangaroo rats are small rodents found in desert regions of North America. They are adapted to conserve water and can withstand high temperatures by remaining inactive during the day and foraging at night. Sidewinder Snakes: These snakes are found in the deserts of North America and are adapted to extreme heat by burrowing in the sand to avoid direct sunlight and regulate their body temperature. Thorny Devils: Thorny devils, also known as thorny dragons, are small lizards native to Australia. Their skin is covered in tiny spikes that help trap moisture, allowing them to survive in hot, arid environments. Dromedary Jumping Spiders: These spiders are found in desert regions of North Africa and the Middle East. They are able to survive in extreme heat by burrowing into the sand during the hottest parts of the day. Desert Beetles: Several species of beetles, such as the Namib Desert beetle, have developed adaptations to survive in hot desert environments. They are able to collect moisture from fog or dew, allowing them to thrive in arid conditions. This information is not DNA's opinion but obtained from media reports",
