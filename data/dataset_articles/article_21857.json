  "text": "Local politicians have responded full of praise to the plans for the water tower in Meppel.\nThe new owners, Ralph Verheijen and Dilana Verheijen-Kuiper, want to restore the monumental tower in Meppel and, among other things, start a small restobar – a bar with ‘restaurant-level dishes’. They are also playing with the idea of organizing wine tastings there.\n“It is a striking point. Together with the Meppel tower, the water tower determines the skyline of Meppel. It is good that there is now a concrete and feasible plan,” says Jelly Koot on behalf of the Christian Union.\nThe tower, just under forty meters high, will have three different uses. The catering area will be located at the bottom of the water tower, with a small outdoor terrace and a vineyard. Offices will be located on the floors above the bar. At the top of the tower, where the water tank used to be, there will be a multifunctional space. For example, workshops or exhibitions can be held there. The two want to have a house built about twenty meters away from the water tower to live in themselves.\n“It emphasizes the historical values of the water tower. It will become one of the most beautiful entrances to Meppel,” says Henk Timmer (PvdA). The VVD agrees. “This development gives a quality boost to the entire area,” says Dave Jansen.\nThe area around the water tower is also facing a major metamorphosis. The Nieuwveense Landen new-build district is in full development, but there are also grand plans for the adjacent industrial estate, which should transform into an attractive area with homes on the water and a place where there is room for recreation.\nAnd then there is also the traffic that is being tackled. Now there is a roundabout adjacent to the water tower, which connects Nijeveen and Nieuwveense Landen with the center and the N375. Maybe that roundabout will disappear completely. In any case, the access road to Nijeveen will be canceled because two new roads are being constructed. A bicycle tunnel from Nijeveen to the center will be built under the site of the current roundabout.\n“It is now busy with car traffic,” says Egbert Knorren (CDA). “But it will become quieter once the new access roads to the Nieuwveense Landen are ready and there is room for cyclists. It will become more of a resting point, a viewpoint. The water tower is strategically located with many cultural-historical values. We want to preserve that, but also showcase it. And that is possible with this plan.”\nThe water tower has been for sale since 2013. In 2017, a company from Rogat bought the water tower, but the intended plans could not be implemented, after which the tower was put up for sale again. In 2020, Ralph Verheijen and Dilana Verheijen-Kuiper came up with their plans, and a year later they signed the purchase agreement. The two hope to start work in the summer.",
