  "text": "Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Friday renewed his commitment to boost agricultural productivity in the country.\nMarcos made the remark after he inspected the P550-million Soil Laboratory Building that is presently under construction in Agusan del Sur.\n“I am also extremely pleased with the establishment of the Agusan Del Sur Provincial Soils Laboratory by the provincial government of Agusan del Sur, the first and the modern one of its kind in Mindanao,” Marcos said in a speech.\n“Ilan lang yan sa mga maraming programang para sa ating mga magsasaka dito sa inyong probinsya upang mapataas ang kanilang ani at mapalaki ang kanilang kita,\" he added.\n(This is just among the programs for farmers in your province, which will help them increase their productivity and profit.)\nAgusan del Sur Governor Santiago Cane Jr. and Executive Adviser and Scientist Dr. Johnvie Goloran briefed the President on the soil laboratory building project located in Prosperidad town.\nThe Presidential Communications Office said that the facility is capable of physical, chemical, and biological characterization of soils using a range of advanced analytical capabilities.\nIt said that the facility could analyze 50-100 soil samples a day, with test results released in less than two to three days. The facility can also analyze soils, plants, water, fertilizer, and gas samples.\nProviding sufficient and accurate soil information to farmers, the soils laboratory will enable them to choose the crops suitable for their farmlands and the type and rate of fertilizer that should be used for their crops for optimum plant growth and development.\nThe Provincial Soils Laboratory is expected to be completed next year with soil chemists, soil microbiologists, and agronomists working as the facility’s lead personnel. — Anna Felicia Bajo\\/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",
