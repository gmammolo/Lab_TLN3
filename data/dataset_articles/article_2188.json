  "text": "DETROIT – A man suspected in the murders of three people found inside a burned vehicle in Detroit has a prison record that includes more than 100 guilty verdicts for misconduct.\nEdward Delorean Redding, 29, of Detroit, is a suspect in the deaths of his ex-girlfriend, her mother, and her 9-year-old niece. Their bodies were discovered the morning of Sunday, April 6, after a car fire was reported near the intersection of 30th and Milford streets in Detroit.\nPolice said Redding’s ex-girlfriend and her mother were shot, and the 9-year-old girl was stabbed in the neck before they were burned.\nRedding was taken into custody on Monday, April 7. Since then, he has been charged with third-degree fleeing and eluding, resisting and obstructing a police officer, and a weapons charge.\n---> Man charged for fleeing Detroit police in high-speed chase after 3 bodies found in burning car\nSuspect’s criminal history\nWhen Redding was 14 years old, he was convicted of armed robbery, carjacking, and a weapons charge from an incident that happened on Sept. 13, 2010.\nHe was sentenced to between 11 and 22 years in prison on Feb. 3, 2011, and began serving time in prison the next day.\nOn July 19, 2022, after serving roughly 13 years, he was released on parole.
