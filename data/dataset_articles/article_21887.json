  "text": "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation stone for the 300 MW solar power plant virtually in Rajasthan today, an official statement from the NLC India Limited said. The project is being set up with an investment of over Rs 1,756 crore to ensure affordable power supply to government entities and is set to be commissioned in September 2024.Speaking at the ceremony, PM Modi said, “India has started moving at a fast pace in generating solar power, and in giving an impetus to this mission, today, foundation stone has been laid for various solar power projects in Rajasthan. The projects will not only provide green and cheap power to the region but also provide great employment opportunities to the youth.”The project, equipped with cutting-edge technology, features high-efficiency bifacial modules manufactured in India,with PM Modi's Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative.The electricity generated by this project will flow through the existing power transmission lines of the Barsingsar Thermal Power Station, aiming to produce an impressive 750 million units of green power annually. This substantial output is projected to offset carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 18,000 million metric tonnes over the project's 25-year lifetime.The power usage agreement for the project has been formalized with Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited at a competitive tariff of Rs 2.52 per unit, ensuring a reliable and cost-effective power supply for the next quarter-century. The project also has the potential to create employment opportunities for approximately 600 individuals indirectly during the project phase and 100 personnel during the operations and maintenance phase.In an official statement, NLC India Limited said, \\\"This project will enable Rajasthan to fulfill its renewable purchase obligation while contributing to the nation's journey towards achieving a net-zero future.\\\"",
