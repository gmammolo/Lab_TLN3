  "text": "Sika shares up after 'cautious' 2024 view, analysts point to recent sell-off ** Shares in Sika [SIKA](/symbols/SIX-SIKA/) rise 4% with analysts pointing to recent Swiss construction chemicals maker's share price underperformance, even as it reported in-line 2023 profit and gave a \"conservative\" forecast for this year ** Sika expects its local currency sales to rise by 6-9% in 2024, compared to current Vara consensus forecasts of 10.3% growth, cited by J.P.Morgan ** JPM says shares have been a poor performer lately within the sector, with UBS also noting the 10% decline YTD ** According to Jefferies, lower guidance for 2024 provides the clearing event for FY24 consensus, which should position Sika for a smoother delivery in the coming year ** The top-line guidance looks conservative, Stifel adds, highlighting however the strong cashflow generation and lower net debt ** Stifel says Q4 2023 gross margin should bode well for a 2024 gross margin and support positive EBITDA margin development ** JPM also notes Sika's significant increase in operating free cash flow, at a new record of 1.37 million Swiss francs ** At Thursday's close, the stock had lost 9.65% since the beginning of the year",
