  "text": "RANCHI: Jharkhand is all set to lead the country in terms of developing a road map for sustainable and just transition of energy usage.Having formed the first of its kind - just transition task force - which is a consortium of multidisciplinary stakeholders including academia, bureaucracy and implementing agencies, the task force took a step further in preparing a road map that includes developing an institution mechanism for sustainable transition and creating a transition fund for accelerating future directions.Congratulating the state for taking a lead, head of Action for Climate and Environment, UNDP India, Ashish Chaturvedi, said the state task force on just transition is not only first in the country but a first-of-its-kind initiative globally. \\\"State should take pride in leading the effort of making state future ready, which can be replicated by other states. While the content of the road map being prepared here can be used by other coal-rich states that will face coal phase down, the process can be utilised by other states and countries where the challenge may or may not be similar as that of Jharkhand,\\\" he said.",
