  "text": "As McLean County navigates historic flooding, Sheriff Ken Frizzell said this is the worst he’s seen in his lifetime — including the 1997 and 2011 floods.\n“This is the largest flood that I’ve been through,” Frizzell said. “In ’97 I was still in high school, and in 2011 I was a deputy sheriff. There are some similarities, but this time around we’re seeing more evacuations.”\nWith the Green River now expected to crest at 36 feet — higher than initial projections — officials are continuing both scheduled and emergency evacuations across the area. Frizzell said several residents who initially chose to stay put have since requested to be evacuated as water levels surpassed what they’d previously experienced.\n“Most people thought the water levels were going to be fine,” he said. “Now that it’s rising beyond what they’ve seen before, they realize they need to get out.”\nThe National Guard, FEMA, and local fire departments are handling many of the evacuation efforts. Frizzell said while no mandatory evacuations are currently in place, residents are encouraged to leave if they feel unsafe.\n“We’re not forcing anyone out. The Constitution gives people rights,” Frizzell said. “But we are getting more calls from people asking to be evacuated, and we’re doing our best to help them quickly and safely.”\nOn Tuesday, a dusk-to-dawn curfew was enacted in unincorporated areas of McLean County to help protect residents and deter looting. Frizzell emphasized the curfew is meant to serve as a law enforcement tool, not to punish people.\n“If you’re going to and from work or attending church or something similar, you’re not going to be bothered,” Frizzell said. “This just gives us the legal means to stop and talk to someone if they’re out at night and appear suspicious. It’s a preventative tool more than anything.”\nSo far, no citations have been issued for curfew violations, and Frizzell said he’s not aware of any major incidents.\nMeanwhile, wellness checks and supply deliveries continue for residents choosing to shelter in place. Emergency teams began those efforts earlier this week , with National Guard trucks and FEMA crews navigating high water areas to ensure people are safe and have food or medical needs met.\n“There are a lot of moving parts right now — people, pets, logistics — but everyone’s working together,” Frizzell said. “We’ve had our moments, but we find a way forward.”\nDespite the widespread flooding and disruptions, Frizzell said the county has been fortunate in some respects.\n“We haven’t had any injuries or loss of life, and that’s a blessing,” he said. “At the end of the day, keeping people safe is the most important thing.”\nThe latest crest predictions could still change as rainfall and upstream conditions evolve. Frizzell said updates will continue to be shared through the Emergency Management Agency and the County Judge-Executive’s office.\n“We’re going to ride this out,” Frizzell said. “And we’ll get through it — together.”",
