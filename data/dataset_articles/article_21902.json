  "text": "Fruit farmer Edward Snow from Savulu Estate in Ra has thrived in agriculture by utilising resources around him to earn a living by planting guavas and dragon fruits and also providing jobs for the community. While speaking to fijivillage News, Snow says despite the hardships brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, his family continued to thrive and was almost unaffected by its impact. He says by the end of last year, they started harvesting more than 750 guava trees and 990 dragon fruits, and it has been supplied to outlets such as Grace Road, New World Supermarket and other outlets around Fiji. The villager thanked the Taiwan Technical Mission based in Naucubonu in Sigatoka and the Agriculture Ministry for their timely assistance in providing seedlings for them to pursue their business. Snow says the dry season is a challenge for them, therefore, they have been waiting for assistance from the Agriculture Ministry to provide them with a borehole, but for the time being, they have been using water tanks to water their farm. He adds that i-Taukeis have a lot of resources with the availability of land but lack the knowledge on how to utilise it. He further says this year, they plan to extend their farm and provide more job opportunities to the villagers. Stay tuned for the latest news on our radio stations",
