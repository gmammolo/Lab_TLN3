  "text": "Technical Adviser on Environment 1 to the governor of Bayelsa State, Alagoa Morris, has been admitted into the Niger Delta Environment Hall of Fame and conferred with membership of the Forum of Visiting Public Intellectuals of the Bayelsa State History and Archives Office. Morris, who is also the Head of Programmes at the Environmental Rights/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, Yenagoa office, was admitted alongside a former Commissioner for Environment, Iniruo Wills, and the second Vice President of the Ijaw National Congress, Nengi James, for their passion in environmental advocacy in the state and Niger Delta in general over the years. The honour was marked with the formal unveiling of their portraits in the Ijaw Nationality Hall of Fame by the Chief Historian and Archivist of the Bayelsa State government, Prof Stephen Olali, at the Ijaw House, Yenagoa. Performing the ceremony, Olali, who took them on a tour of the archive and resource centre library, said the recipients had distinguished themselves in the advocacy for a better and sustainable environment of the Niger Delta. He said, “This office is mandated by His Excellency, the executive governor to document the historical heritage of Bayelsa State, the Ijaw ethnic nationality and her neighbouring regions. “This conferment is in recognition of your profound interest in matters pertaining to our individual and collective history and heritage as a people. It is especially in relation to the environment, with specific emphasis on environmental advocacy, which you have been engaged in for so many years. “The office unequivocally regards you as intellectuals wholly dedicated to the preservation of the environment and therefore wishes to admit you into its Forum of Public Intellectuals. Consequently, the office looks forward to having copies of your publications and manuscripts, which shall be displayed in your honour in its resource centre library.” Responding, Morris said he was delighted to be among the recipients of such great honour, adding that he considered it a rare privilege, noting that his unveiled portrait was a historical piece that would “give the future generations an insight into my journey of environmental advocacy in the Niger Delta.” Thanking the government and the state’s chief historian and archivist for the conferment, Morris said, “The little things we do are sometimes being observed by people we least expected to show recognition. And this recognition that has been given to me today, I value it so much.” He also expressed appreciation to former governor, Seriake Dickson, now senator representing Bayelsa West at the National Assembly, for establishing the office, and the incumbent Governor Douye Diri for continuity.",
