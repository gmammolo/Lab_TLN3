In the next 15-20 days, your saplings will be ready for transplantation.\n4. For soil, you must mix sand in the soil if it is clay-like. Further, add compost and some neem cake to enrich the soil.\n5. You can transplant your saplings in any pot of 12-18 inches depth.\n6. Give water to the tomato plants only as per requirement.
