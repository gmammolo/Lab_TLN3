  "text": "Grand Forks man sentenced, accused of shooting at officers\nGRAND FORKS, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Jeffrey Simpson Jr. of Grand Forks was sentenced Wednesday afternoon, on a laundry list of charges, including attempted murder.\nSimpson Jr. was sentenced to 25 years in prison, after a shootout with law enforcement in March of 2024.\nIn making his decision, the judge said, “We’ve seen too many acts of violence against law enforcement officers. Simpson Jr. needed to be held accountable and made an example of.”\nOn March 22nd, 2024 officers responded to the 3300 block of Primrose Court in Grand Forks, for a report that a homeless man shot at officers in a residential neighborhood. Simpson Jr. was also accused of strangling his ex-girlfriend, kicking her, punching her and holding a gun to her head. Simpson was found guilty in the case.\nOn Wednesday, during the hour-long hearing in Grand Forks County Court, prosecutors read a statement from the domestic violence victim. Simpson Jr’s dad was there as well, and spoke to the courtroom.\n“Please know once our son is released from prison, as a father I will make it my mission that he live a happy and productive life. My son has struggled for many years with this addiction. He is a good man. Just along the way he lost himself.” Simpson’s father said.\nSimpson Junior’s dad, and the defense both argued that he had no prior history, adding that he is former military and addicted to meth. Still, the judge said none of those things should excuse what happened in March of 2024.\n“The nine months I spent in a relationship with him were a period of unrelenting terror, the effects of which continue to shape my life and the lives of my family.” one victim said.\nThe woman says the night before the shootout, she and her son were removed from their home by officers and taken to a shelter. The next day, officers showed up to arrest Simpson. That is when police say, he got out of his vehicle and opened fire on them.\n“Everything that was presented at the trial sure seems to indicate that you were doing that with the intent to hit those folks and end their lives. It just didn’t work out that way.” Judge Kay Knudson said.\nNo one was hit by the gunfire, but it happened in a busy area, at an apartment complex in Grand Forks. After Wednesday’s sentencing, the defense asked if the judge could make sure Simpson Jr. got his military uniform back. Judge Knudson said, “he would have to figure that out on his own” adding “he’s not even sure if he deserves it.”\nSimpson Jr. was also ordered to pay thousands of dollars in restitution. He is also ordered to have no contact with any of the victims.\nCopyright 2025 KVLY. All rights reserved.",
