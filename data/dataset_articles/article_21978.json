  "text": "Photo from Unsplash Originally Posted On: https://store.adventinteractive.com/blog/the-evolving-environmental-benefits-of-opting-for-a-preowned-phone-or-laptop.html\n“A small step for you, a giant leap for environmental conservation. Every refurbished device is a powerful choice for a greener tomorrow.”\nMany people tend to buy brand-new gadgets, but there’s a significant shift toward choosing pre-owned phones or laptops. These are previously owned devices that have been carefully checked, fixed, and restored to a condition that’s almost as good as new. Opting for a refurbished laptop or phone not only helps your wallet but also benefits the environment. The United Nations notes that electronics contribute to around 50 million tons of e-waste yearly. Reusing electronics by refurbishment cuts down on e-waste and saves natural resources. The UN report highlights that refurbishing a million smartphones can conserve 16,000 tons of materials such as gold, silver, and rare earth elements. Moreover, using a refurbished smartphone can lower greenhouse gas emissions by about 45 kg CO2 compared to producing a new one. Similarly, the European Union’s research indicates that refurbished laptops are less taxing on the environment than new ones, potentially reducing negative environmental effects by 60%.\nThe Environmental Impact of Electronics: Comparing New and Refurbished This opening discussion aims to dissect the environmental impact of both new and refurbished laptops and phones, casting light on a critical yet often overlooked aspect of our modern tech-driven world.\nNew Electronics and the Environment New electronic gadgets necessitate significant use of precious resources—metals, plastics—and energy-consuming manufacturing that increases carbon emissions. Additionally, electronic waste poses a critical environmental issue, as the ejection of toxic substances can contaminate soil and water, posing risks to ecology and human health.\nRefurbished Electronics: A Greener Alternative Refurbished phones, laptops, or other electronics are a more sustainable option; they demand less resource extraction, energy, and waste production. These devices often consist of components from non-functioning or returned units, thereby not only consuming fewer resources but also reducing their environmental footprint.\nExtended Use Reduces Environmental Strain Keeping electronics operating longer through refurbishment diverts them from landfills, which struggle with decomposition, curbing demand for new products and diminishing the environmental toll.\nCarbon Emissions and Refurbished Laptops or Phones: While new device production generates substantial greenhouse gases—for instance, manufacturing a smartphone leads to around 85 kg of CO2 emissions—refurbishing lowers this figure, enhancing the ecological friendliness of electronic devices.\nEnergy Savings with Refurbished Tech Creating new tech products is energy-intensive. Refurbishing, however, is markedly less so; for example, renewing a laptop can use 50 times less energy than manufacturing a new one, largely because refurbishing bypasses the resource-heavy steps of mining and transportation.\nTackling the E-Waste Challenge Over 50 million tons of electronic waste are produced yearly, with many disposed of improperly. Refurbishing and reusing devices help cut down this number, with the potential to shrink both the carbon footprint and e-waste by 30% if a smartphone’s life is just one year longer.\nConserving Material Resources The drive for new devices exhausts scarce elements like rare earth metals. Through refurbishment, the necessity for virgin materials plummets, relieving the pressure on these finite resources.\nMoreover, purchasing a pre-owned laptop or phone means you will not receive it with the original packaging, eliminating the need to dispose of any such materials. Packaging waste is a significant environmental issue, as the plastics and Styrofoam that safeguard new electronics can linger in landfills for centuries, often causing pollution long before they degrade. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that 54 million metric tons of electronic waste were produced in 2019, yet only a fraction, two million tons, was recycled. That figure has risen to approximately 59.4 million metric tons by 2022. By opting for used phones, not only is the demand for new phone packaging reduced, but also the amount of waste that contributes to the growing problem of e-waste in our landfills.\nMoreover, many pre-owned phones now come unlocked, providing versatility and ease for the consumer. Unlocked phones can be used with various carriers, allowing users to select or switch plans at their convenience. This not only adds a level of freedom for the consumer but also underscores the environmental benefits.\nEconomic Upsides of Refurbished Tech Cheaper than their new counterparts, refurbished phones or laptops offer an economic advantage as well as environmental, making sustainable choices accessible to more people and lessening the impact of electronic production on the planet.\nRefurbished Phones or Laptop Reduces Transportation Pollution Purchasing used phones or laptops can lead to a notable reduction in environmental impact. The transportation of new consumer goods is a major source of pollution, involving substantial fuel consumption by freight vessels and aircraft, along with the use of extensive packaging materials required for safe transit. Opting for used phones diminishes the need for such distribution chains. Moreover, it also curtails the ecological footprint associated with shipping defective returns, thereby playing a significant role in lessening transport-related pollution.\nWrapping up, in the realm of travel essentials, smartphones, and laptops are significantly important for the contemporary traveler. They maintain connections with friends and family, provide navigation, and entertainment, and enable remote work while traveling. Opting for refurbished pre-owned phones or laptops offers cost savings and environmental benefits — it reduces electronic waste and conserves resources, extending the life of electronics and diminishing the need for new manufacturing and raw material extraction, thereby reducing our environmental impact. The majority of refurbished gadgets present a reduced ecological impact when juxtaposed with their new equivalents. Therefore, opting for used phones or refurbished laptop deals in our daily lives allows for substantial environmental benefits, mitigating landfill waste and resource consumption.",
