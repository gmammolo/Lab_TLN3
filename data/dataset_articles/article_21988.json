  "text": "Nestled on the northwestern coast of Penang Island, Malaysia, Teluk Bahang is a serene seaside town that offers a perfect blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage and exciting attractions. While many visitors flock to Penang’s capital city, George Town, Teluk Bahang remains a hidden gem worth exploring.

Explore the well-marked trails that wind through the rainforest, leading to scenic beaches like Pantai Kerachut and Monkey Beach. Don’t forget to visit the park’s iconic Meromictic Lake, a rare phenomenon where layers of saltwater and freshwater do not mix.\n2 | Visit the Tropical Spice Garden\nA numbered trail for plant hunting, a lotus flower pond, a garden full of poisonous plants and even an outdoor fish spa.

Although not a nature experience, taking a DIY batik-making workshop is a fun group-bonding activity that lets you hone your creativity and art skills. Enjoy spending half a day painting colourful hues on a piece of fabric pre-waxed with floral patterns. During your visit, expert artisans will also demonstrate the meticulous wax-resist dyeing technique, showcasing the rich heritage and creativity behind each vibrant piece.
