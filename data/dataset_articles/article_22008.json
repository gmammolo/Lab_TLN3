  "text": "2 hours ago\nOregon Department of Agriculture and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife announce new shellfish openings after tests showed clams in these areas are safe to eat.\nBay clamming has been reopened on the north coast and is now open from the Washington border to Cascade Head. Levels of the marine biotoxin paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) have tested below the closure limit on two consecutive rounds of testing.\nAlso, razor clam harvesting has reopened on the south coast and is now open from Cape Blanco to the California border. Levels of the marine biotoxin domoic acid have continued to test below the closure limit. Razor clamming also remains open from the Washington border to Yachats River.\nRazor clam harvesting is closed from the Yachats River to Cape Blanco. Bay clam harvesting is closed from Cascade Head to the California border. Mussel harvesting remains closed along the entire Oregon coast.\nCrab harvesting is open along the entire Oregon coast including bays and estuaries.\nOregon Department of Agriculture will continue to test for shellfish toxins weekly, as tides and weather permit. Reopening an area closed for biotoxins requires two consecutive tests with results below the closure limit.\nRemember to always call Oregon Department of Agriculture’s (ODA) shellfish biotoxin safety hotline at (800) 448-2474, the Food Safety Shellfish Desk at (503) 986-4726, or check the ODA recreational shellfish biotoxin closures webpage before clamming or crabbing.",
