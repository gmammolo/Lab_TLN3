  "text": "AHMEDABAD: Flamingos within city limits are an incredible sight. What is more exciting is that for the first time, ornithologists have documented lesser flamingos nesting in an urban setting. ‘Nesting attempt of Lesser Flamingos (Phoeniconaias Minor) in urban areas of Bhavnagar, Gujarat’ by Kandarp Andharia and Prashant Andharia details the first-ever recorded instance of 70 to 90 birds actively nesting behind the Bhavnagar airport in a 1.5sq km lake formed by excess water from a nearby salt pan despite the traffic, construction, congestion and other disturbances in Oct 2021. The researchers observed that a few birds were sitting on mound-like structures, while others were digging out the soft mud and putting it on mounds. At least eight birds were giving the mud deposition a round shape with their beaks. What makes the find one of its kind is that this location is more than 300km from the birds’ traditional nesting ground in the Little Rann of Kutch’s eastern regions. A failed attempt away from LKR was recorded in Porbandar in 1994. Ornithologists noticed nests in 2022, 2023 were destroyed by stray dogs. The birds have returned again this year and are being closely monitored by the duo.We also published the following articles recently Bird enthusiasts thrilled as they record 56 bird species in ArippaDiscover the diverse bird species spotted by Warblers and Waders during their 32nd annual trail at Arippa Eco Tourism Centre.
