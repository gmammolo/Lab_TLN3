  "text": "A trapper in the Florida Everglades landed a colossal catch of one of nature’s vicious predators.\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation’s python trapper Matthew Kogo rounded up a 17-foot-long snake along Francis S. Taylor Wildlife Management Area near Fort Lauderdale over the weekend.\n“Gotta let her work, as my Brazilian jiu-jitsu friends say. Gotta let ’em work,” said Kogo.\nBurmese pythons are native to southeast Asia and were introduced to Florida via the pet trade. Now the invasive species is threatening native wildlife.\nThey eat everything from deer to alligators and have reduced some mammal populations by 90%, according to the FWC.\nWith the negative effects Burmese pythons have had in the Everglades, contests like the Florida Python Challenge will give people a chance to hunt them to lower the numbers in the wild.\n“You see how I’m switching hands? That way I don’t tire myself out,” said Kogo.\nSnakes are active when it’s warm and humid, making summertime snake season.\n“You know, when ‘snaking,’ it’s important, to take the time, enjoy the moment,” said Kogo.\nIf you want to be just like Florida man Kogo, you’re in luck. Florida is still accepting applicants for the annual Python Challenge.\nThe competition starts next month.\nIf you are interested or want more information, click here .",
