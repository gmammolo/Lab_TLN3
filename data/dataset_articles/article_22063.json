  "text": "Stefano Boeri Architetti, the designer of the acclaimed Vertical Forests was commissioned to build a new technology museum in Xi’an, China. This anticipated structure will serve as a tree-covered man-made mountain, allowing visitors to explore on the top, and immerse themselves in nature in the midst of a chaotic metropolis. Dubbed the Culture CBD Modern Technology Experience Center, the building features a unique hilly form that is inspired by the area’s topography, including the mountains, rivers, and the rugged valley.\nDesigner:\nStefano Boeri Architetti\nThe building will have a curving concrete form amped with expansive glazing on the front-facing facade. The facade will be marked with horizontal slats for shading. The rooftop will feature a stepped exterior and include terraces and walkways, including loads of plants and trees. They will also contain different kinds of shrubs, as well as perennial herbs. Visitors can ascend to the top, and they will be welcomed by beautiful hanging gardens, as well as a massive viewing platform that offers serene views of the city.\n“On the roof, the project includes a hanging garden in continuity with the park and a system of terraces that allows visitors to climb up to the building and gain a new look at the surrounding urban panorama,” said Stefano Boeri Architetti. “The green terraces accessible to citizens will be an integral part of the museum’s cultural program of events (the different areas will host screenings, activities, shows, and performances) – as well as offering citizens a new public outdoor space, with unprecedented views of the park and the city. ”\nAs you enter the museum, you will be greeted by four main exhibition spaces, as well as a temporary exhibition area, and multiple commercial zones. The various sections will be linked by a big double-height central atrium. The decor of the interiors will feature a vibrant and bright blue hue, which was selected on account of its significance and heavy usage in digital design and art. This is a popular choice in the world of digital design, and once you start looking out for it, you’ll find that it is quite widespread.\nCurrently, nature-inspired architecture in on the rise in China, and the cultural center will be another invaluable and wonderful addition. Although currently, we don’t know when it will be completed, the project is being headed by Stefano Boeri Architetti’s China-based satellite branch, instead of the main Italian studio.",
