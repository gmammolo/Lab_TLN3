  "text": "Shandong is harnessing the power of outdoor sports to revitalize its rural areas. By transforming its abundant natural and cultural resources into outdoor recreation destinations, Shandong is attracting visitors, creating jobs, and boosting local economies.\nShima town, Zibo, a prime example of this transformation, once struggled to attract attention despite its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. However, by embracing outdoor sports, the town has become a popular destination for hiking, cycling, and other activities. The Wuyang Lake Sports and Culture Park receives over 300,000 visitors annually and provides jobs for over 200 rural residents.\nRecognizing the potential of outdoor sports, Shandong has launched initiatives to support and develop the sector across the region. A sports carnival kicked off in Shima Town on June 29, featuring diverse competitions, including a swimming race, a climbing competition, and a kayaking show.\nAthletes sprint fiercely in a marathon held as part of the sports carnival. [Photo/WeChat account: shandongshengtiyuju]\nThe success of events like the 2023 World Triathlon Cup held in Weihai last year further demonstrates the economic impact of outdoor sports. The event generated 47 million yuan ($6.46 million) in direct economic benefits and a quantifiable brand value exceeding 400 million yuan.\nShandong plans to develop rural characteristic outdoor sports industries such as mountaineering, cycling, water sports, air sports, and camping. It will also cultivate and create rural characteristic outdoor sports consumption scenarios, deepen the integration of sports with various industries, and aid in rural vitalization.\n来源：chinadaily.com.cn 编辑：孔垂頔 责编：宋基金 主编：韩信",
