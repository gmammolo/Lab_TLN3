Here’s a look at some of the most common projects we see homeowners tackle during the warmest season: The start of summer saw heat descend over much of the nation, and we can expect more as the season continues. Here’s a look at some of the most common projects we see homeowners tackle during the warmest season: Air conditioning is often the single most significant energy drain in your home. Regular maintenance can save you money every month on utility bills and improve comfort in the sweltering heat. You should hire an HVAC company to perform a tune-up on your AC, inspect your system and verify everything works smoothly to improve efficiency. This work usually costs about $100; twice-yearly inspections are often included if you have an existing service contract with a local HVAC company. In addition to keeping your system working in tip-top shape, regular inspections ensure that your service company is familiar with it. In many cases, they can catch small and easily repaired problems before they escalate into much larger and costlier system failures. It also helps to have a preexisting relationship with your HVAC company if something goes wrong in the heat. That often helps get you faster service in an emergency. Summer is an excellent time to install new windows. Older windows are more likely to create drafts and don’t block heat as efficiently. Window technology is constantly improving, so a new set of windows can cut energy costs and increase home comfort. Windows also provide an effective way to give your home a whole new look. Check out your weather stripping even if you don’t replace your windows. This is often thought of as a winter project, but weather strips also help keep cool air from escaping the home. Replacing weather stripping is a simple task that can pay off in a big way. Your exterior gets plenty of attention during the summer months, and it’s always the first thing people see when coming to your home. Good landscaping and exterior care increase enjoyment of your home and boost resale value. Cleaning your outside elements plays a significant role in making your home stand out this summer. Pressure washing your siding, decks or driveway can blast away long-standing grime and give your home a shine that looks brand new. Resealing and staining your deck every few years adds to its life span and gives it a face-lift. And, of course, hiring lawn maintenance pros to look after your yard will give your exterior an even better appearance. To make your backyard truly BBQ-ready, add new elements such as native plants or trees, or even an outdoor kitchen, new deck or patio. Features that extend your living area to the outdoors make a great entertaining option for socializing or relaxing and often increase home value. If you’re landscaping on a budget, do projects in phases that build upon each other. Tweet your home care questions with #AskingAngi and we’ll try to answer them in a future column.
