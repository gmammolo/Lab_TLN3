  "text": "New Delhi: Delhi zoo authorities are using ayurvedic methods, including neem oil, turmeric and quicklime, to keep the animals healthy and free from bacterial and viral infections during the rainy season, officials said. “We will use some Indian home remedies like neem oil, which will help protect the animals from common biting insects, including mosquitoes, biting midges and fleas,” Delhi zoo Director Sanjeet Kumar told PTI. He emphasised the importance of preparing for rain-related health issues by stocking necessary medicines.Heavy rains often lead to waterlogging in certain parts of the zoo which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. To counter this, quicklime (chuna) will be sprinkled in these areas to prevent mosquito proliferation. Additional measures include providing elevated platforms in areas prone to water accumulation, ensuring animals have dry spots to rest. ptiWe also published the following articles recentlyDelhi Zoo implements ayurvedic methods to safeguard animals during monsoonLearn how Delhi Zoo is keeping animals healthy during the monsoon season with ayurvedic remedies like neem oil and turmeric.
