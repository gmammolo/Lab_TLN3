  "text": "KITTERY, Maine — For the past three days, Mainers in Kittery Point and surrounding areas have enjoyed the rare sight of a humpback whale that has been lingering close to shore in Pepperrell Cove. [Kittery Harbormaster](https://www.kitteryme.gov/harbormaster) John Brosnihan said whales usually don't swim too close to the harbor. For days, Brosnihan has been working to make sure people are cautious and considerate as they get close looks at the marine animal. \"Do me a favor, take your line up,\" Brosnihan said as he directed people to move away from the whale, temporarily halting fishing in the area. The deck and harbor in the cove was packed on Independence Day, but everyone's eyes were glued to the water. Kittery police officer and commercial fisherman Danny Contois got a fantastic shot of the humpback whale. \"I don't think I've ever been that close to a whale,\" Contois said. \"Probably won't ever happen again, but it was nice to see.\" John Perry is nearly 82 years old. He comes from a long line of Perry's who have lived within a half mile of the wharf since the 1760s. \"I've been around this place forever, and I've seen so many things down here,\" Perry said. \"But I've never seen a whale.\" The harbormaster told NEWS CENTER Maine he suspected the whale may have been tangled in lobstering gear, but that concern has not been confirmed. He also expressed worry that crowds trying to catch a glimpse of the marine mammal from the water may be causing it distress. \"It's my belief. It's mostly because you see what's going on today. The boats are following it around and probably spooking it,\" Brosnihan said. Although everyone is excited to see the marine animal up close, Contois said people need to remain a safe distance away. \"You don't want to harass the animal,\" Contois said. Brosnihan also warned that getting too close to the whale could startle it, putting it in danger in while it swims in congested waters. \"If they change their behavior at all due to your activities, it's actually a federal crime,\" Brosnihan said. Brosnihan advised people who plan to spend time boating and fishing in Pepperrell Cove while the humpback whale is lingering close to the shore to take appropriate safety measures, putting their boats in neutral and picking their fishing lines up out of the water. \"It's his house. It's where he lives. We're visiting here, in fact,\" Brosnihan said. \"We're visiting his home. So, just give him room. Let him eat.",
