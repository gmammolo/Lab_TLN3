  "text": "[Microplastics](https://www.marineconservation.org.au/microplastics/) are tiny plastic particles that pollute water sources and cause significant health risks to humans and wildlife. Unfortunately, traditional microplastics filtration methods can sometimes fall short due to high costs, slow processes or the use of harmful chemicals. Victoria Ou and Justin Huang from The Woodlands College Park High School in Texas have won a huge prize for their potential solution to the microplastics issue. They showcased an invention designed to filter such particles from water, earning them the esteemed [Gordon E. Moore Award for Positive Outcomes for Future Generations](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/awards/gordon-e-moore-awards/) and a USD50,000 (AUD74,904.25) scholarship prize. The two students presented their groundbreaking project at the 2024 International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF); a device that operates by using ultrasound waves to push microplastic particles to one side of a water flow, allowing clean water to pass through while trapping the contaminants. In their tests, the system successfully captured up to 94 per cent of microplastic particles, showing promise for real-world applications. \"If we could refine this, maybe use more professional equipment, maybe go to a lab instead of testing from our home, we could really improve our device and get it ready for large-scale manufacturing,\" Justin [told Business Insider.](https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-win-fifty-thousand-for-ultrasound-microplastic-filtration-device-2024-5) The duo envisioned their device being used in water treatment plants, directly modifying the quality of water for daily use. This application could significantly reduce the amount of microplastics that end up in water sources, protecting ecosystems and human health. They also see a potential for their device to be incorporated into household laundry machines. Synthetic textile particles from laundry contribute to [around 35 per cent](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-43023-x) of primary microplastics pollution. By filtering out these particles before the water is discharged, their device could prevent a substantial amount of microplastics from entering the environment. This approach tackles the problem at its source, offering a proactive solution to a pervasive issue. In our [previous article](https://www.planetark.org/newsroom/news/removing-microplastics-from-every-laundry-wash-gains-fast-track-support), we’ve shared filtering solutions currently available on the Australian market and actions we can take to help reduce microplastics and pollutants entering waterways.
