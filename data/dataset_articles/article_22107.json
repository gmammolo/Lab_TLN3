It mandates immediate notification upon arrival, detailed shipment information, and secure holding to prevent pest spread until inspection. The bill also strengthens labeling requirements and grants inspectors the authority to enforce quarantine and treatment protocols.\nSB3365: COMPREHENSIVE BIOSECURITY MEASURES\nSB3365 requires the mandatory distribution of state plant and animal declaration forms to passengers and crew arriving from outside Hawaiʻi. Visitors, returning residents, and crew will be allowed to submit their forms electronically while maintaining Hawaiʻi’s paper option.\nHB2298: PROTECTING HAWAIʻI-GROWN COFFEE\nThis legislation addresses deceptive labeling practices of Hawaiʻi-grown coffee. Effective July 1, 2027, the law prohibits the use of geographic origin names like “Kona” on coffee products unless they contain at least 51% coffee by weight from that origin. The bill mandates clear labeling requirements for coffee blends and strict enforcement to protect the integrity of Hawaiʻi-grown coffee brands.\nHB2278: ENHANCING MACADAMIA NUT LABELING TRANSPARENCY\nHB2278 increases transparency in macadamia nut labeling by requiring products containing nuts grown outside Hawaiʻi to disclose this fact on the label. It prohibits misleading “with Hawaiʻi-Grown” claims unless all macadamia nuts are sourced from Hawaiʻi, with stringent enforcement measures and penalties for violations.\nThe complete list of bills signed included the following:\nClick links to see full details of bills enacted into law.\nRELATING TO FARMERS\nRELATING TO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTION\nRELATING TO AGRICULTURE\nRELATING TO REGULATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES\nRELATING TO CAMPS\nRELATING TO PESTICIDES\nRELATING TO INVASIVE SPECIES\nRELATING TO FERAL CHICKENS\nPhotos from today’s ceremony, courtesy Office of the Governor, will be uploaded\nhere.\nGovernor Green presented\nthis slide deck during today’s event.\nVideo of the event can be viewed\nhttps://fb.watch/t5GzJDn7OX/.\n# # #\nMedia Contacts:\nErika Engle\nPress Secretary\nOffice of the Governor, State of Hawai‘i\nOffice: 808-586-0120\nEmail:\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#503522393b317e353e373c35103831273139397e373f26)\nMakana McClellan\nDirector of Communications\nOffice of the Governor, State of Hawaiʻi\nCell: 808-265-0083\nEmail:\n[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e9848882888788c7848a8a858c85858887a981889e888080c78e869f)",
