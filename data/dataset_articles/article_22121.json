  "text": "New Delhi: The central government issued new scheme guidelines for the funding of testing facilities, infrastructure, and institutional support under the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM), focusing on enhancing the quality and testing ecosystem in the burgeoning Green Hydrogen sector.The newly sanctioned scheme, carrying a financial commitment of Rs 200 crore for the period 2024-26, aims to identify and address gaps in existing testing infrastructures and foster the development of new facilities that meet rigorous standards required for Green Hydrogen and its derivatives.\\\"The scheme emphasizes the development of a robust quality and testing ecosystem that is in line with national and international standards,\\\" stated a document released by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). It outlines the objectives to create and upgrade testing facilities across the country, ensuring the safe, efficient, and secure operation of Green Hydrogen technologies.According to the guidelines, the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) will act as the Scheme Implementation Agency (SIA), responsible for overseeing the application and implementation processes. The SIA will issue Calls for Proposals (CfP) to identify projects for the establishment and enhancement of testing facilities.\\\"The financial support for these initiatives will be allocated in three stages: 20 per cent on selection, 70 per cent upon reaching certain milestones, and the final 10 per cent upon project completion,\\\" the MNRE specified. Furthermore, rigorous monitoring and evaluation by a Project Appraisal Committee will ensure the alignment of projects with the mission’s goals.Any projects failing to adhere to the specified timelines or objectives risk cancellation of funding, under the stringent oversight measures put in place by the government.\\\"This strategic investment into testing infrastructure underlines our commitment to advancing India's capabilities in Green Hydrogen, aiming to position the nation as a leader in this critical sector of the future,\\\" concluded the release.",
