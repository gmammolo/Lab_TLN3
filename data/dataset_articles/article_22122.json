  "text": "The Serchio delle Muse Festival (Serchio of the Muses Festival) was born from the desire to pay tribute with art to the picturesque Serchio Valley and its natural beauty. Concerts are held in squares, on church parvises, in poets' gardens, in the woods: unique places that for one evening come alive with lights, colors and unusual sounds. When night falls and the show is about to go on, the Serchio Valley rediscovers magic and like a spell the Serchio calls its Muses and all spectators. The festival, which is held from May 10 to December 12, brings the top of opera and classical music to the squares of the beautiful villages of the Serchio Valley, allowing everyone to attend the performances of top artists in a setting of absolute charm and with free admission. After the debut in Castiglione di Garfagnana on May 10, the festival gets into full swing: And still many appointments throughout the summer. Not to be missed, like every year, the Evening Homage to Pascoli, scheduled on Saturday, August 10 in the garden of House Pascoli in Castelvecchio. This year, the Poet will be read by Massimo Ghini and Letizia Toni, with Luca Scarlini as narrator, the Ensemble Le Muse directed by Maestro Andrea Albertini and the direction of Alessandro Bertolucci. For this event, there is an entrance fee (tickets €25). The appointments continue until December 12, with a final event in Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.",
