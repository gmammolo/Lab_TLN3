  "text": "Panchkula: Haryana govt, in collaboration with the UK govt, is going to set up a centre of excellence for management of fruits and vegetables in Panchkula. The project is estimated to cost around Rs 115 crore.Haryana agriculture and farmers welfare minister Kanwar Pal has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the UK govt in this regard. The minister said the centre would be ready by 2026. Kanwar Pal said that India ranks second in the production of fruits and vegetables globally, but 20 to 30% of this production capacity is destroyed. With this centre of excellence, the fruits and vegetables of the farmers of the state will be properly maintained, he said, adding that the centre would be developed by adopting state-of-the-art technologies and with the cooperation of foreign and other national level institutions. “After harvesting, fruits and vegetables can be stored at the right temperature and humidity level, which will increase the shelf life of these agricultural products,” he added.The minister said the centre would help in strengthening the cold chain system in India and making it energy efficient. At the centre, experiments would be conducted to reduce the post-harvest loss of fruits and vegetables We also published the following articles recentlyPacify farmers sitting on protest at Shambhu to open border: Haryana minister to Union agriculture ministerLearn about the ongoing farmers' protest at Shambhu border on NH-44 in Ambala.
