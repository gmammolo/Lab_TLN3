Arjuna died on December 4, 2023, in a fight with a wild elephant during an elephant capture operation by the Karnataka Forest Department near Yeslur. The foundation stone for another memorial will also be laid on the same day in the Nagarhole forest area, where Arjuna spent most of his life. His statue, along with pictures of him carrying eight golden ambara, participating in various elephant, tiger, and leopard capture operations, will also be installed at both memorials.
