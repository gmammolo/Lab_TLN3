  "text": "NEW DELHI: Delhiites breathed the cleanest air since Sept 11 last year, as the air quality index (AQI) dipped to 61 in the 'satisfactory' category on Thursday. A lower AQI than this was seen on Sept 11 when it was 53. Rain, along with strong winds, cleaned the air.Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory, said, \\\"Rain is the cause for the low AQI. However, it doesn't mean that the air pollutants have disappeared. It is a common phenomenon that rain washes everything away; that's the beauty of the sub-tropical region. However, when there will be no rain, the pollution will bounce back.\\\" He added, \\\"To reduce the emissions, everyone has to work throughout the year.\\\"Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, \\\"This is very typical of the monsoon season. Consistent and prolonged rain has a washout effect that cleans up the air. In seasonal comparison, monsoon months are usually the cleanest.\\\"The Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that Sept 2023 had witnessed nine 'satisfactory' days and one 'good' day when the AQI touched 45 on Sept 10.Oct last year saw one 'satisfactory' day with an AQI of 89 on Oct 17. However, no 'satisfactory' day was seen from Oct 18, 2023, to June 26 this year.The first 'satisfactory' day of the year was recorded on June 27 with an AQI of 79. No 'good' air day has been seen in 2024 till now.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the air quality is likely to remain 'satisfactory' until July 7 and then for subsequent six days, it may stay in the 'satisfactory' to 'moderate' category.",
