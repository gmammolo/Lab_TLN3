  "text": "Opening of Mexican market for day-old chicks boosts Brazilian segment - ABPAMexican flocks impacted by avian infleunza\nThe Brazilian Animal Protein Association (ABPA) celebrated the announcement made yesterday by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock about the opening of the 1-day-old chick segment from Brazil to Mexico,\naccording to a recent market report from ABPA.\nThe announcement occurred after the official acceptance, by the Mexican authorities, of the International Zoosanitary Certificate (CSI) for the import of this high-value-added segment of Brazilian poultry farming.\n“Mexican poultry farming has faced impacts on its flocks resulting from occurrences of avian influenza. In this sense, Brazil, which already supplies fertile eggs, now presents itself as a reliable partner for the supply of 1-day-old chicks,\" said Ricardo Santin, president of ABPA. \"It is worth highlighting that it is another important achievement for Minister Carlos Fávaro and his team for Brazil.\"\n“The expectation is that Mexico, which is already the largest importer of Brazilian fertile eggs, will also establish itself among the highlights in the 1-day-old chick segment,\" said Luís Rua, ABPA’s markets director. \"It’s another seal of approval for Brazil’s biosecurity.\"\nMore News\n[](/latest?section=news) [View all](/latest?section=news)",
