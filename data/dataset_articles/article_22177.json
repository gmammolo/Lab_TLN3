  "text": "Brighten the beach : Beaches can be a bit of a mess after the Fourth of July. Almost as if by coincidence, Turtle Island Restoration Network — the nonprofit behind the whimsical Turtles About Town sculptures all over the island — is sponsoring an island-wide cleanup on Friday morning. Check-in begins at 8:30 a.m. at Menard Park, 2228 28th St., with cleanup from 9 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.; weighing the trash and returning materials is set for 10:30-11:30. Specific cleanup sites will be assigned upon registration, split into three areas: East End, seawall and West End. (Yes, you get to choose.) After the trash is all weighed, a post-cleanup social hour kicks off at noon at Galveston Island Brewing , 8423 Stewart Road. Registration and more details at seaturtles.org/july5 .\nCherry bomb : A fast-talking, Tupperware-hawking, flame-haired spitfire in high heels, Dixie Longate has a relentless desire to entertain and an unquenchable need to cut her audience in on the best possible deal on all sorts of plastic storage containers. Since “emerging” from a Mobile, Alabama trailer park in 2001, Dixie — the drag persona of playwright Kris Andersson — has sold more than 170,000 tickets on stages worldwide and a heckuva lot of Tupperware along the way. This weekend, however, she’ll be trying something new: her first-ever standup show, “Cherry Bombs and Bottle Rockets,” which promises to touch on everything from UFOs to “pogo-sticking” in Dixie’s inimitable style. (Note: not suitable for those under age 16.) Appropriate for the long holiday weekend, Longate will be here for two star-spangled performances at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday at The Grand 1894 Opera House , 2020 Postoffice St. Tickets start at $25; visit thegrand.com for details.",
