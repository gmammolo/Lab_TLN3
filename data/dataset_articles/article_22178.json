  "text": "Egypt launches clean transportation initiative in Sharm El Sheikh with five electric buses.\nThe Governor of South Sinai stated that the governorate is determined to continue its efforts towards the sustainability of Sharm El Sheikh as an environmentally friendly, clean, and pollution-free city.\nThe new electric buses are being inaugurated after the establishment of two charging stations, confirming that the city has been provided with five buses as a first batch at a cost of approximately LE50 million.\nHe explained that the bus can accommodate 49 passengers and is equipped with an internal camera, two external cameras for driving, a USB charger, a bus stop device to alert the driver that a passenger wants to get off, and a fire alarm and self-extinguisher.\nHe pointed out that these buses are Egyptian-made and can travel a distance of between 300 and 350 kilometers on a single charge.\nIt takes from 120 to 180 minutes to charge the bus at the station, and it is limited to a speed of no more than 70 kilometers per hour to match the speed limit for operation within cities.",
