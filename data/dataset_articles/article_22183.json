  "text": "Many Berkshire towns have large holdings of land that are open to the public. Lucky public. In the case of Pownal, Vt., most of a tract of land was open but had been inaccessible since 2011, when Tropical Storm Irene enlarged the Hoosic River and took out a riverside section of the trail. Now, with the help of numerous partners, including the Vermont Land Trust, the town has added 300 acres plus a right-of-way — soon to be ownership — on a four-acre parcel that provides public access. Members of the town’s Conservation Commission, Parks and Recreation Committee, the Hoosic River Watershed Association and the public in late June assembled in Halifax Hollow to walk the new route. Attending was Sarah Gardner of Williams College’s Center for Environmental Studies. In the fall, her planning class students will work with town boards to make recommendations about the use of the town forest. (For free.) The original 700 acres belonged to the Pownal Tannery, which treated hides in an old mill building beside the Hoosic. Earlier, the land probably belonged to the textile mill, which would have wanted to protect the clean water coming off the Taconic Range for its operations. Lewis Hine’s 1910 photograph of little Addie working there created support for a national child labor movement. Previously, the river was dammed for a grist mill. The Tannery discharged untreated wastewater into the river until 1962, when a lagoon system was installed and later the Dean Road Landfill took the contents of the lagoons. The company declared bankruptcy in 1988. The 28-acre mill site was declared a U.S. Superfund site in 1999. The Environmental Protection Agency and state environmentalist came up with an imaginative way to turn pollution into river improvement. That included tearing down the mill while leaving the dam and water intake to continue hydroelectric generation, capping the lagoons and landfill, and installing the community’s first wastewater treatment plant. Pownal homes are on a sewer line for the first time. The popular Taconic Crest Trail once ran 36 miles from Hancock Shaker Village to the Tannery land. Reportedly, unregulated four-wheelers and aggressive dogs forced a change, the terminus becoming Prosser Hollow in New York state. More recently, New York acquired land to continue the trail north to Route 346, beside the Hoosic in North Petersburg, N.Y. Pownal would like to see the town, and Vermont, once more connected with a trail that meanders between New York and Massachusetts. The Taconic Hiking Club, based in Troy, N.Y., and New York state do not want motorized vehicles on the trail, but riders have a traditional claim on some of the many trails on the Tannery property. Hiking and riding — and perhaps newer uses, such as mountain biking — would be options. In the Tannery days, most of the land was cleared, perhaps in part to get the tannin necessary to work the hides. Will logging continue? Hunters have traditionally roamed the land. The new right-of-way leads above the private holdings and onto tannery land on the steep side of the Taconics. We cut through shrubbery off Dean Road. Soon we’re on a bulldozed logging road, passing the active gravel operation on our right. We cross a log landing, with steep skidder roads dropping down to the brook on our left. A mile or so up we stop where, angling off the trail to the right, we get a view of a waterfall through the forest. Most public land is controlled by the state or nonprofits in these parts. With the 1,000-acre Tannery land, representatives of the town, aided by college students, will work through the issues. It should be exciting. At least, that’s how it looks from the White Oaks.",
