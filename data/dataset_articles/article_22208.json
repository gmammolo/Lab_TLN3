  "text": "The Africa Policy Research Institute, in collaboration with the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Foundation, HOMEF, Centre for Social Studies and Development Agenda, and supported by the Ford Foundation, held a high-level dialogue on Nigeria’s energy transition.\nExperts highlighted Nigeria’s energy landscape, marred by environmental degradation and socio-economic disparities, particularly in the Niger Delta.\nDecades of oil exploration have destroyed farmlands, polluted water bodies, and degraded air quality, severely impacting local communities.\nMr. Nnimmo Bassey, Executive Director of HOMEF, stressed the need for transparency and accountability in the energy sector.\n“Federal, state, and community engagement with companies is essential to hold them accountable for their activities,” he said.\n“It’s imperative we address the root causes of the oil and gas sector crisis. Energy companies and governments must take responsibility for their actions and fully engage with community members,” Mr Bassey added.\nHe emphasised clear conversations between the government, energy companies, and communities to outline stakeholder roles and accountability.\nIn a panel discussion moderated by Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri, panelists agreed on broadening Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP).\nMs. Tengi George-Ikoli, Comrade Ndieze Ikechukwu Agunwa, and Lanre Sasore called for a more people-centred approach to sourcing energy resources. They believe this would prevent Nigeria from suffering high levels of energy poverty and climate change impacts.\nDarren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation, urged communities to hold elites accountable. “There can be no justice without community input,” he said.\n“It’s time to challenge elites globally and ask for their accountability in creating and contributing to Nigeria’s extractive community challenges.”\nJoseph Onoja, Director General of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, emphasized the need for government action.\n“We must address the injustice and non-inclusion of locals in the renewable energy era. Energy mineral sourcing often destroys biodiversity-rich areas, impacting locals. We must approach the new energy transition process holistically to avoid further injustice,” he stated.",
