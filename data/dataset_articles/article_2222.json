  "text": "Sunny Isles (Florida) police recently responded to a call about a dispute involving Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill , according to a police report reviewed by the Palm Beach Post , part of the USA TODAY Network. According to the report, Hill's mother-in-law contacted authorities Monday afternoon due to a domestic dispute involving Hill's wife at their home. Hill's mother-in-law said Hill was acting “very aggressive and impulsive,” and that she feared for her daughter’s safety. According to the police report, Hill's mother-in-law called police after claiming Hill threw a laptop, grabbed his daughter and began walking toward a balcony of the high-rise. The report also said Hill's wife, Keeta, stated that she is in the process of filing for divorce. Both parties stated that the argument never became physical. Officers observed a light red mark or bruise on Keeta's upper chest. Keeta said it may have occurred without malice when Tyreek grabbed their baby from her. No arrested were made, according to the report. DOLPINS TO TRADE TYREEK HILL? He posts ‘peace out’ emoji again. Hill has been the subject of multiple off-the-field issues, including a detainment outside Hard Rock Stadium after a speeding incident prior to the 2024 home opener. Hill has also been accused of breaking the leg of a social media influencer during a demonstration of football drills at his home. Hill has taken to social media recently to openly reply to comments implying or suggesting he could or should be traded by the Dolphins before next season.
