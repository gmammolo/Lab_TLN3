  "text": "WASHINGTON (TNND) — There is a disturbing update on the case of 13-year-old Oscar \"Omar\" Hernandez, who went missing last month.\nHis body was discovered last week on the side of the road in Oxnard, California.\nThe suspect, Mario Edgardo Garcia-Aquino, an undocumented immigrant from El Salvador, was already under investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for allegedly sexually assaulting at least two other teenage boys.\nThe charges allege that Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino on that date of March 28, 2025, murdered Omar Hernandez in Lancaster. Mister Garcia Aquino was his soccer coach,\" said Nathan Hochman, Los Angeles District Attorney.\nIn Fairfax County, Virginia, Wilmer Osmany Ramon Giron, who had been deported twice, was recently charged with abduction, assault on a family member, and felony strangulation of his ex-wife.\nDespite facing 15 years behind bars, he was released after just two months, following a plea deal by Fairfax County Commonwealth Attorney Steve Descano.\nOn his website, it states, “Wherever possible, Steve will make charging and plea decisions that limit or avoid immigration consequences.”\nVirginia Attorney General Jason Miyares criticized Descano's approach, saying, \"Somebody like Descano clearly views himself as a social worker instead of a prosecutor. That's not your role. Your job as a prosecutor is to vigorously protect your citizens.\"\nThe debate over how best to protect citizens is now front and center on Capitol Hill, with a House Judiciary Committee hearing focused on sanctuary laws, which often prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials\n\"You can’t have public safety when you’re releasing lawbreakers into the community,\" said Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J.\nMany Democrats spoke in defense of the sanctuary policies, including Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who defended her state's Keep Washington Working Act.\nWe know that when local police act as federal immigration agents, communities are less likely to come forward to report a crime when they are a witness or a victim.\"\nHer state is now in the middle of a fight, that started in the small rural region of Adams County.\nSheriff Dale Wagner is being sued over not following the sanctuary policies, accused of sharing inmate information with federal immigration agents.\nWagner was one of the witnesses who testified at Wednesday's hearing.\n\"Rather than allowing law-enforcement agencies to work at local, state, and federal levels together, sanctuary policies force us to re-arrest individuals who could’ve been transferred to federal custody. This strains our jails, wastes tax money, and puts residents at unnecessary risk,\" he said.\nHouse Republicans have proposed a new bill called the \"Safeguarding American Property Act.\"\nIt seeks to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, adding property crimes like arson, trespassing, and vandalism to a list requiring mandatory detention and likely deportation for undocumented immigrants.",
