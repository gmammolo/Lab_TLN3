  "text": "Nano-priming is an emerging application of nanotechnology in agriculture intending to increase crop yield and nutritional quality, while reducing fertilizer applications. This study aimed to investigate the effects of seed priming with citrate-coated CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) suspensions (10, 20, and 40 mg NPs L− 1) on the life cycle of the Phaseolus vulgaris L. OTI cultivar and evaluate the technology costs. The effect of nano-priming was assessed in the germination, flowering, and harvest stages. Unprimed and hydro-primed seeds were negative and positive controls, respectively. Nano-priming with CoFe2O4 NPs had no effect neither on the germination nor on plant nutrition (in the flowering stage) of OTI beans compared to unprimed and hydro-primed seeds. In contrast, nitrogenase activity (343.3 ± 1.1 µmol h− 1 plant− 1 of C2H4 ) was detected in the plants from the 40 mg kg− 1 nano-primed seeds. The K concentration of progeny seeds from nano-priming with 10, 20, and 40 mg NPs L− 1 increased significantly by 3%, 16%, and 13% compared to the control seeds. The Zn concentration in the seeds from nano-priming with 10 mg NPs L− 1 was 27% higher than in the control and 28% higher than in the hydro-primed seeds. When nano-priming with 40 mg NPs L− 1, the Zn concentration was 5% and 6% higher than the control and hydro-primed seeds. The calculated cost of nano-priming seeds per ha ranged from 121 to 143 USD. In this regard, nano-priming of bean seeds with citrate-coated CoFe2O4 NPs could be a low-cost approach to achieve nutritional security and agricultural sustainability.",
