All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are forward-looking information and statements. The words \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"contemplate\", \"target\", \"plan\", \"intends\", \"continue\", \"budget\", \"estimate\", \"may\", \"will\" and similar expressions identify forward-looking information and statements. In addition to the forward-looking information and statements noted above, this presentation includes those that relate to: the expected results of exploration activities; the estimation of mineral resources; the ability to identify new mineral resources and convert mineral resources into mineral reserves; ability to raise additional capital and complete future financings; capital expenditures and costs, including forecasted costs; the ability of the Company to comply with environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements; future prices of precious metals; the ability of the Company to obtain all necessary approvals and permits in connection with the development of the Bayan Khundii Gold Project.\nSuch forward-looking information and statements are based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company as of the date of such information and statements, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. These estimates and assumptions relate to, among other things, the continuance of the Company and its subsidiaries as a going concern, general economic and market conditions, gold prices, the accuracy of mineral resources and mineral reserve statements, and the other estimates and assumptions contained in the Bankable Feasibility Study.\nReaders are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are not guarantees of future performance. There can be no assurance that such information and statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those presented in such information and statements. Forward-looking information and statements is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking information and statements. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the volatility of the price of gold, uncertainty of mineral resources, exploration potential, mineral grades and mineral recovery estimates, delays in exploration and development plans, insufficient capital to complete development and exploration plans, risks inherent with mineral acquisitions, delays in obtaining government approvals or permits, financing of additional capital requirements, commercial viability of mineral deposits, cost of exploration and development programs, risks associated with competition in the mining industry, risks associated with the ability to retain key executives and personnel, the impact of COVID-19, title disputes and other claims, changes in governmental and environmental regulation that results in increased costs, cost of environmental expenditures and potential environmental liabilities, accidents and labour disputes. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking information and statements. Please see the Company's Annual Information Form dated March 27, 2024 available on the Company's website at www.erdene.com or on the Company's SEDAR+ profile at www.sedarplus.ca, for details of other risks facing the Company. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information and statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable laws.\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this presentation, such as Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Initial Capital Costs, Total Cash Cost, All-In Sustaining Cost, and Effective Cash Tax Rate which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other corporations. Each of these measures used are intended to provide additional information to the user and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nPeter Dalton, P.Geo. (Nova Scotia), Senior Geologist for Erdene and a \"Qualified Person\" under National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information in this presentation. All currencies are reported in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.\nDEVELOPING THE HIGH-GRADE KHUNDII MINERALS DISTRICT\nInvestment Thesis\nFirst mover in an unexplored portion of one of the world's great mineral belts - unparalleled discovery potential for large, high grade, gold and copper deposits\nBayan Khundii Gold Project - high-grade\ngold development moving rapidly to\nproduction\nMultimillion ounce potential\nPowerful Alliance - uniting Erdene\nwith Mongolia's leading miner backed by one of the Country's largest conglomerates\nZuun Mod Molybdenum-Copper Porphyry\nComplex - a sleeping giant\nmultiple high grade gold discoveries adjacent to the Bayan Khundii Gold Project and significant exploration upside in district 3\nTHE EMERGING KHUNDII MINERALS DISTRICT\nMAKINGS OF A MULTI-MINE,MULTI-COMMODITY MINING DISTRICT\nBAYAN KHUNDII GOLD-\nEXPANSION/ EXTENDED\nALTAN NAR GOLD - GOLD\nSILVER DEVELOPMENT\nMINE LIFE BAYAN KHUNDII\nSILVER LEAD ZINC\nZUUN MOD MOLYBDENUM\nNEW DISCOVERIES AND\nCOPPER\nACQUISITIONS\n2025 PRODUCTION @ >75,000 OZ PER ANNUM THROUGH 2030\n2024-2028 ADVANCE TO\n2024-2028 ADVANCE TO\nPRODUCTION DECISION\nPRODUCTION DECISION\n2030 TO 2040 EXTEND\n2028 TO 2040 PRODUCTION @\nPRODUCTION @ 50,000 TO\n75,000 TO 100,000 OZ PER\n100,000 OZ PER ANNUM\nANNUM AuEq\n2024-2029 ADVANCE TO\nHIGH PROBABILITY OF\nPRODUCTION DECISION\nADDITIONAL DISCOVERIES\n2030 TO 2050 PRODUCTION\nIN DISTRICT\nTHE FUTURE: GOLD, COPPER, MOLYBDENUM, SILVER, LEAD & ZINC PRODUCTION\nGLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF ARC RELATED GIANT GOLD AND COPPER DEPOSITS\nKhundii Minerals District: A window of opportunity - Limited exploration in a highly prospective belt\nKhundii Minerals\nDistrict\nLocations of giant ore deposits discussed in this paper and significant arc-related metallogenic belts (purple lines).\nBase map modified from World of Maps™ (© Bruce Jones Design, 2010).\n5\nLOCATED IN THE GOLD AND COPPER RICH CENTRAL ASIAN OROGENIC BELT\nIn the underexplored, highly prospective Trans Altai Terrane in Southwestern Mongolia\nHOST TO MULTIPLE MAJOR GOLD-COPPER DEPOSITS INCLUDING MURUNTAU (175MOZ AU) AND OYU TOLGOI\nUSGS concluded the Trans Altai shows the greatest potential for porphyry / epithermal copper-gold discoveries on the CAOB\nNotes:\n1.
