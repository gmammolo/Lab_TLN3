  "text": "I knew that the spectacular great green macaws were nesting nearby. But where? Several birds continually flew low overhead, broadcasting their raucous calls. I then saw a man working in his garden who just might know. I quickly reviewed the necessary Spanish vocabulary in my mind, gathered up my courage and walked up and said, “Buenos días, señor. Comó está? Sabe usted dónde anidan las guacamayas?” Well, not only did he understand my Spanish but he was absolutely delighted to point to the dead branch in a tree up the road where their cavity nest was located. I thanked him profusely and walked up to the nest site where I enjoyed great views of these rare birds perched by the nest entrance. A short while later as I was heading home, he came outside and asked how I’d made out. He then invited me into his garden and proudly showed me the tree where the macaws regularly came to feed. If that wasn’t kind enough, he then offered me a “cafecito” and gave me a tour of his property, all the while pointing out other birds, interesting plants and a family group of agoutis. He was clearly delighted to show off his beautiful property with this gringo birder.",
