  "text": "By 2030, a significant portion (70-90 per cent) of the existing diesel bus fleet will be replaced with clean energy ones. — VNA/VNS Photo\nHÀ NỘI — The capital city of Hà Nội is taking a significant step toward a more sustainable future for its public transportation system, with a Thursday approval of a plan to achieve a zero-emission bus fleet by 2035 via phasing out diesel vehicles in favour of electric ones.\nBetween 2026 and 2030, Hà Nội aims for a mix of electric buses (50 per cent_ and buses powered by cleaner burning fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) (50 per cent). The estimated financial investment for this transition is VNĐ43 trillion (US$1.79 billion).\nThe plan prioritises the electrification of buses operating in the central urban areas (within Ring Road 4). Additionally, new bus routes will be designed with a focus on using electric and green energy vehicles.\nBy 2030, a significant portion (70-90 per cent) of the existing diesel bus fleet will be replaced with clean energy ones.\nBetween 2031 and 2035, all buses operating in the city will go electric, achieving a zero-emission bus fleet for the city. — VNS",
