  "text": "The charging of the electric car battery developed by the UK start-up company Nyobolt has been successfully tested. In the first live demo, the car’s battery was charged from 10% to 80% in 4 minutes 37 seconds, which is a great achievement for the company.\nThis was achieved with a specially developed concept sports car on a test track in Bedford, and is part of an industry-wide effort to charge electric vehicles (EVs) more quickly.\nHyundai has launched the first luxury electric car in Pakistan\nEliminating the issue of “range anxiety” is key to increasing EV adoption, say experts. But the importance of making this battery charging infrastructure efficient is also emphasized.\nPaul Shearing, professor of sustainable energy engineering at the University of Oxford, told the BBC: “Developing technology that enables people to charge more quickly is very important. He said that there is an imperative need to have more chargers for all types.\n<iframe class=\"nk-iframe\" onload=\"setInterval(()=>{try{this.style.height=this.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+’px’;}catch{}}, 100)” width=”100%” frameborder=”0″ scrolling=”no” style=”height:250px;position:relative” src=” sandbox=”allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups allow-modals allow-forms”>\nA current Tesla Supercharger car battery charges up to 80 percent in 15-20 minutes, compared to a battery developed by Newbolt.\nThe sports car fitted with a Nyobolt battery that was tested for a week and two days achieved a range of 120 miles after four minutes.\nWhile a Tesla car is charged to 80 percent, its range typically goes up to 200 miles.\nThe demo was performed live for the first time in front of an invited audience of industry professionals.\nThe New Bolt company says it does not plan to manufacture its own vehicles, but plans to install batteries inside EVs within a year and partner with existing car brands.\n#Battery #charged #minutes #beats #Tesla #World\n2024-07-05 03:17:07",
