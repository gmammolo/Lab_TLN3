  "text": "As the winter chill settles over Perth, the East Kimberley – with its warm, inviting climate – is calling. In the northern reaches of Western Australia, this region offers an endless summer, making it an ideal escape for those of us dreaming of swapping our puffer jackets for swimwear.\nTrading the cold Perth winter for the balmy air of the East Kimberley is more than just a change in weather—it’s an invitation to immerse yourself in a landscape of stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. Whether you’re exploring ancient landscapes, paddling serene waters, or simply stargazing, the East Kimberley offers a warm, welcoming escape that will leave you refreshed and inspired.\nWe’ve partnered with the Kununurra Visitor Centre to bring you some of the best things to do in the East Kimberley region, for an unforgettable, sun-drenched holiday.\nExplore the ancient wonders of the Bungle Bungle Range The 360-million-year-old Bungle Bungle Range in Purnululu National Park is a natural phenomenon. These striking beehive-shaped sandstone formations are a testament to the earth’s ancient past. Hiking through this UNESCO World Heritage Site, you can discover hidden gorges, stunning lookout points, and unique flora and fauna. The Cathedral Gorge and Echidna Chasm walks offer some of the most incredible views and photo opportunities.\nCamera Icon\nCathedral Gorge in the Bungle Bungle Range. Credit: Supplied. Paddle on Lake Argyle Lake Argyle, one of the largest human-made freshwater lakes in the southern hemisphere, is the perfect spot for kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding. As you paddle along, keep your eyes peeled for freshwater crocodiles, wallabies, and more than 250 species of birdlife. A sunset cruise on Lake Argyle is an absolute must, where you can watch the breathtaking spectacle of an East Kimberley sunset, cold drink in hand.\nCamera Icon\nPaddle on Lake Argyle.

Whether you choose a secluded campsite in the national parks or a more luxurious glamping setup, the night sky will dazzle you with its brilliance. Lying back and gazing at the Milky Way is an incredible way to feel a profound connection to the natural world.\nCamera Icon\nSleep under the Stars. Credit: Supplied. Marvel at cascading waterfalls The wet season transforms the East Kimberley’s rugged landscape into a network of cascading waterfalls. Even in the dry season, many falls continue to flow, creating the most stunning sights. Mitchell Falls and King George Falls are two of the most spectacular, and visiting these waterfalls often involves scenic flights or boat trips.\nCamera Icon\nMitchell Falls. Credit: Supplied. Experience the local Aboriginal culture The East Kimberley is rich in Aboriginal heritage, with lots of opportunities to engage with the local culture. Art galleries in towns such as Kununurra and Warmun display incredible Indigenous artworks, from traditional dot paintings to contemporary pieces. Joining a guided tour with a local Aboriginal guide can provide deeper insights into the land’s history, cultural significance, and the stories behind the art. Engaging with the local community and participating in cultural experiences is not only enriching but also supports the preservation of these ancient traditions.\nCamera Icon\nMitchell Plateau people looking at art.
