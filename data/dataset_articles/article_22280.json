  "text": "Through the work of the National Commission for UNESCO, Montenegro will work dedicatedly to preserve and promote cultural and natural heritage, support education, science and innovation, as well as ensure the representation of the state on the international stage, with special attention to the inclusion of young people and local communities. This was announced by the president of the commission and Minister of Culture and Media, Tamara Vujović. At the constitutive session of the National Commission for UNESCO, Vujović said that a new phase of joint work in the areas in which UNESCO operates has begun today. \"We started this phase with the intention of jointly improving, promoting and protecting culture, nature, science, education, sports, human rights and all other areas within the scope of UNESCO, an organization that has been dedicatedly working for more than seven decades to preserve world heritage and improve international cooperation\", stated Vujović. As announced by the Ministry of Culture and Media, she assessed that in previous years, Montenegro achieved significant successes in the field of preservation and promotion of its cultural and natural heritage. \"Inscription of our sights on the World Heritage List, but also preservation of their status on that List, entry of the Bokel Navy on the Representative List, but also the development of educational and scientific programs, as well as engagement in global initiatives of UNESCO, are just some examples of how we can to successfully contribute to global goals through local actions\", emphasized Vujović. As she pointed out, the commission has a key role in harmonizing national interests with international standards and UNESCO initiatives. \"As a bridge between Montenegro and UNESCO, we work to implement UNESCO's programs and projects, promote education, science, culture and communications, and ensure that our voice is clearly and strongly represented on the international stage,\" Vujović said. According to her, the work of the commission faces important tasks, but also challenges. \"It is our responsibility to continuously improve the protection and promotion of our heritage, ensure the sustainable development of our natural resources, and support education and innovation. We must pay special attention to strengthening awareness of the importance of cultural and natural heritage among young people, as well as involving local communities in the processes of preservation and valorization\", said Vujović. At the session, it was also concluded that for the preservation of the properties inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, the cooperation of all relevant departments is necessary, not only for preservation, but also for the conscientious use and promotion of the cultural and natural heritage of Montenegro. Vujović called on all members of the commission to make maximum efforts in the coming period to realize the goals. \"Your expertise, experience and dedication are key to the success of our work. I believe that together we will achieve significant results and make our contribution both at the national and international level. Our path is not always easy, but with joint effort and dedication, we can achieve great things for our country and the world community. We are the ones who can do good things for our Montenegro,\" Vujović said. Bonus video:",
