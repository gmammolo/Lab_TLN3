  "text": "Studio L2 aims to innovate and make the industry more sustainable\nHairdresser Linnea Prytz wants to revolutionize the hairdressing industry. She aims to develop and modernize it, ensuring that customers get the best possible experience while making her salon more profitable and sustainable. She is currently transforming her salon with the help of the SaaS company Digmi.\nStudio L2, led by the dynamic and innovative Linnea Prytz, is taking another step forward by expanding its collaboration with Digmi. Together, they will make the salon reception-free, allowing each hairdresser to manage their clients directly from the chair.\nThe salon is not only known for its exceptional service but also for working with high-quality brands like Maria Nila, Noberu, and GHD, guaranteeing that customers receive the best in hair care and styling. Linnea's goal is for each customer to feel unique and beautiful, and her passion for innovation and modern methods makes Studio L2 a pioneer in the industry. Her team of eight skilled hairdressers, all holding journeyman and master certificates, offer a range of services from haircuts and coloring treatments to barbering and piercing.\nDigital transformation\nJust like in a modern restaurant, where you can order, receive offers, and pay without leaving your table, Studio L2's customers will enjoy a seamless experience without having to get up. With Digmi's advanced software and hardware, hairdressers can now offer consultations, sell products, take payments, and rebook clients directly from the hairdressing chair. Hairdressers can also update client cards with treatment information and preferences, making the process smoother and more personalized.\nAn important part of the digitization is that Studio L2 is replacing all physical advertising with Digmi's digital screens. These screens display marketing material from the salon's suppliers, and all the content is already uploaded in Digmi's software. Linnea and her team can publish these campaigns on the screens with just a few clicks, without needing to use a computer. They can also easily edit the campaigns by adding prices, their own logo, or other details, and then quickly distribute these campaigns both on the salon screens and on social media.\nDigmi's software can be advantageously used with existing equipment, but for salons that wish, Digmi can also offer upgrades to the latest technology.\nThe new digital screens, measuring 55 and 43 inches, are already installed and in use. This summer and fall will be an exciting period as the service continues to develop and optimize. With Digmi's technology, Studio L2 looks forward to creating a modern and efficient salon that is at the forefront of both customer experience and marketing.\nLinnea Prytz shares her experience of the collaboration: \"The digital transformation journey would not have been possible without the fantastic service from Digmi. Our industry isn't the most technical in the world, so all the help we've received has been invaluable. Thanks to Digmi, we can now offer an even better customer experience while improving our profitability and sustainability.\"\nDigmi's growth phase\nDigmi is now entering its next phase with a focus on growth. After developing and refining its services with its customers over the past few years, Digmi is now aiming to conquer Europe with its unique solutions. Newly recruited CEO Jon Berglund will take over in september and looks forward to leading the company into this expansive phase.\nJoel Lagerkvist, the current CEO of Digmi, expresses his enthusiasm for the growing collaboration: \"We are incredibly excited to work with Linnea and her team at Studio L2. Their commitment to innovation and quality reflects our own vision, and we look forward to achieving fantastic results together.\"\nStudio L2 and Digmi are excited about the opportunities this collaboration will bring, and they are confident that it will set a new standard for how hair salons can operate and interact with their customers.\nFor more information:\nJoel Lagerkvist, CEO of Digmi, joel@digmi.se;\nTobias Lindberg, majority owner and IR manager, tobias@linstar.se\nAbout Digmi: Digmi is an innovative tech company from Småland, operating both nationally and internationally in the beauty and hair care industry.",
