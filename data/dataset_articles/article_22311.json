We have, in our midst, the likes of Francis Kahata, Kenneth Muguna and Patrick Matasi who have all had a taste of the continental stage. So, we are not scared,” Musa remarked.\n“With adequate preparations, we can easily advance further than the preliminary stage and bring honour to the country,\" he added.\nMusa, who once steered Kenyan champions Gor Mahia to multiple top-flight titles, said he and his Kenya Police teammates were elated after accomplishing a lofty target they had set at the onset of the season.\n\"We worked extremely hard to get ourselves in continental football. It's a target we set at the start of the season and we're all happy we managed to achieve it,\" Musa remarked.\n\"The goal was to clinch the Kenyan Premier League title but once that evaded us, we knew bagging the FKF Cup was the only remaining route to the continental stage. There was no room for laxity in the finals against KCB.\n\"We put many hours in training trying as much as we could to polish our act. We didn't take anything to chance. We practiced all the set pieces including penalty kicks in anticipation of a tough clash,\" he added.",
