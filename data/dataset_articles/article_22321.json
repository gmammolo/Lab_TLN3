For Kia, the partnership is a key part of its transition to becoming a global provider of sustainable mobility solutions, as it aims to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain by 2045.\nAs a core component of the partnership agreement, The Ocean Cleanup is providing Kia with ocean plastic catch extracted during the cleanup operations in the Pacific Ocean. And together, the two organizations are exploring how the recovered plastic can be recycled and integrated into Kia's products so that they never re-enter the natural environment.\n\"At The Ocean Cleanup, we are dedicated to cleaning up the world's oceans and waterways, and processing the collected plastic with our partners in the most sustainable way possible. We are proud of our collaboration with Kia and look forward to the first application of this marine plastic in their vehicles. Additionally, we are very pleased that Kia has provided us with these four state-of-the-art electric models so that we can carry out our work on land, not only comfortably but also emission free,\" said Boyan Slat, Founder & CEO of The Ocean Cleanup.\nSEE MORE SEE LESS MEDIA ADD ALL TO MEDIA CART DOWNLOAD ALL Highest quality files will be downloaded for all the assets.
