  "text": "News release: July 4, 2024 Peel Region encourages residents to practice smart watering habits this summer Brampton, ON. (July 4, 2024) - As temperatures rise, Peel recommends that residents adopt water-saving practices for their outdoor watering. These simple actions can make a significant difference in water conservation during the summer months. Tips for using less water outdoors: - Water less frequently: Most lawns and gardens do not require daily watering. Watering less often, but more deeply, promotes strong root growth, making plants more drought resistant. - Monitor the forecast: Adjust watering schedules based on the weather forecast to avoid overwatering and unnecessary irrigation. - Optimize watering times: Water before 10 a.m. or after 7 p.m. to reduce water evaporation. - Check for leaks: Regularly inspect outdoor taps, hoses, faucets, and sprinklers for leaks to prevent water waste. - Raise mower height: Set your lawn mower to a higher level. Longer grass shades the roots and helps keep moisture in the soil. - Sweep, don't spray: Use a broom rather than a hose to clear driveways, sidewalks, and patios. - Add mulch to your garden: Mulching helps prevent moisture loss and controls weeds. - Collect rainwater: Install a rain barrel to store rainwater for future watering needs. - Consider [Fusion Landscaping](/water/efficiency/fusion-landscaping.asp): Create a beautiful, low-maintenance outdoor space that needs less watering. By practicing smart watering habits daily, we can save water while maintaining a beautiful landscape.
