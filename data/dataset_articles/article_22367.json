  "text": "Global Blueprint for Health: WHO and UN Unveil Comprehensive Environmental Guide The \"Compendium of WHO and Other UN Guidance on Health and Environment\" (2024 update) provides a consolidated source of guidance on health and environmental factors, targeting policy-makers to aid in reducing preventable environmental risks. This essential resource addresses major health determinants and emphasizes intersectoral collaboration for effective interventions. Available from WHO. [CoE-EDP, VisionRI](/Home/AuthorArticles?fl=CoE-EDP, VisionRI)| Updated: 05-07-2024 12:20 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 12:20 IST In an era where environmental and health challenges are intricately linked, the \"Compendium of WHO and Other UN Guidance on Health and Environment\" emerges as a beacon of consolidated knowledge. Updated in 2024, this compendium brings together essential guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other United Nations (UN) agencies, offering a robust framework for policy-makers to address the significant health risks posed by environmental factors. Addressing Environmental Risks to Health Environmental risks are responsible for approximately 24% of global deaths, a staggering figure that underscores the critical need for preventive action. The compendium highlights the significant health benefits that can be achieved by mitigating these risks. For instance, tackling air pollution could prevent a large number of deaths from ischemic heart disease, strokes, lung cancers, and respiratory infections. Similarly, improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) could drastically reduce diarrheal diseases, while better management of chemicals could prevent numerous unintentional poisonings. The compendium provides detailed strategies to address both ambient and indoor air pollution, covering sources such as household cooking and heating, as well as the environmental impacts of tobacco smoke and mold. It also outlines comprehensive guidelines for ensuring safe drinking water, managing recreational water, improving sanitation, and promoting personal hygiene practices. Comprehensive Environmental Health Factors The guidance within the compendium covers a wide range of environmental health factors essential for maintaining public health. These include ensuring clean air, a stable climate, adequate WASH facilities, safe chemical use, radiation protection, sound waste management, healthy workplaces, supportive cities, sustainable diets, and the preservation of biodiversity. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the intrinsic linkages between human health and nature, reinforcing the need for integrated strategies that encompass both health and environmental considerations. Implementing Cross-Cutting Approaches A notable feature of the compendium is its emphasis on cross-cutting topics such as One Health, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health. This approach is crucial for addressing complex health challenges that span multiple sectors. The guidance also includes Health Impact Assessments (HIA) to evaluate the health effects of policies and projects, promoting a holistic view of health that goes beyond traditional boundaries. Each section of the compendium is classified by sectors involved, level of implementation, implementation instruments, and evidence category, making it a practical tool for policy-makers. It provides references to key resources, exposure assessments, guideline values, and tools for assessments and interventions, ensuring that users have access to comprehensive and up-to-date information. Tools and Resources for Effective Implementation The compendium is not just a repository of guidelines; it is a toolkit for action. It offers practical tools for assessment, intervention implementation, and capacity-building. Policy-makers and other stakeholders can find detailed recommendations for maintaining occupational health and safety, promoting healthy work environments, and preventing work-related diseases and injuries. By compiling guidance from various UN agencies, the compendium supports the strategic objectives of the WHO Global Strategy on Health, Environment, and Climate Change. It aims to scale up action on health determinants in all policies and sectors, ultimately contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A Critical Resource for Policy-Makers The compendium serves as a critical resource for decision-makers in the health and environmental sectors. It provides evidence-based guidance to improve public health outcomes through environmental action, underscoring the importance of intersectoral collaboration and comprehensive approaches to health and environmental challenges. As new evidence and recommendations emerge, the compendium will continue to be updated, ensuring that it remains a relevant and valuable tool for creating healthier environments. - FIRST PUBLISHED IN: - Devdiscourse ALSO READ [Ecuador Plunged Into Darkness: Power Restored After Nationwide Outage](/article/headlines/2988677-ecuador-plunged-into-darkness-power-restored-after-nationwide-outage) [Steady Pound Awaits BoE Decision Amid Currency Market Tight Ranges](/article/sports-games/2988679-steady-pound-awaits-boe-decision-amid-currency-market-tight-ranges) [Top Stories in Finance: JPMorgan Lifts Bonus Cap, Labour's Tax Loophole Stand, Rival AI Start-up by OpenAI Co-founder](/article/business/2988681-top-stories-in-finance-jpmorgan-lifts-bonus-cap-labours-tax-loophole-stand-rival-ai-start-up-by-openai-co-founder) [India's Economic Growth: Speedy, But Unequal](/article/education/2988685-indias-economic-growth-speedy-but-unequal) [Punjab Police conducts massive raids across top 10 drugs hotspots of each districts](/article/headlines/2988703-punjab-police-conducts-massive-raids-across-top-10-drugs-hotspots-of-each-districts)",
