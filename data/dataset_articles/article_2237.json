  "text": "South Korea- /\nEntertainment- /\n- KOSDAQ:A408900\nRisks Still Elevated At These Prices As Studio Mir Co., LTD (KOSDAQ:408900) Shares Dive 32%\nThe Studio Mir Co., LTD (KOSDAQ:408900) share price has softened a substantial 32% over the previous 30 days, handing back much of the gains the stock has made lately. The recent drop completes a disastrous twelve months for shareholders, who are sitting on a 69% loss during that time.\nAlthough its price has dipped substantially, given around half the companies in Korea's Entertainment industry have price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") below 1.5x, you may still consider Studio Mir as a stock to avoid entirely with its 4.8x P/S ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/S.\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n Check out our latest analysis for Studio Mir\nWhat Does Studio Mir's Recent Performance Look Like?\nAs an illustration, revenue has deteriorated at Studio Mir over the last year, which is not ideal at all. It might be that many expect the company to still outplay most other companies over the coming period, which has kept the P/S from collapsing. However, if this isn't the case, investors might get caught out paying too much for the stock.\nWant the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then ourfree report on Studio Mirwill help you shine a light on its historical performance.\nWhat Are Revenue Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/S?\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/S as steep as Studio Mir's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the industry decidedly.\nTaking a look back first, the company's revenue growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 24%. Regardless, revenue has managed to lift by a handy 22% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the earlier period of growth. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would be roughly satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.\nComparing the recent medium-term revenue trends against the industry's one-year growth forecast of 16% shows it's noticeably less attractive.\nWith this information, we find it concerning that Studio Mir is trading at a P/S higher than the industry. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than recent times would indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent revenue trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\nThe Bottom Line On Studio Mir's P/S\nEven after such a strong price drop, Studio Mir's P/S still exceeds the industry median significantly. We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.\nThe fact that Studio Mir currently trades on a higher P/S relative to the industry is an oddity, since its recent three-year growth is lower than the wider industry forecast. Right now we aren't comfortable with the high P/S as this revenue performance isn't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless there is a significant improvement in the company's medium-term performance, it will be difficult to prevent the P/S ratio from declining to a more reasonable level.\nDon't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Studio Mir (1 is potentially serious) you should be aware of.\nIf companies with solid past earnings growth is up your alley, you may wish to see this free collection of other companies with strong earnings growth and low P/E ratios.\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place\nWe've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free.\n• Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n• Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n• Track the Fair Value of your stocks\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\nHave feedback on this article?
