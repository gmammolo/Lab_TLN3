  "text": "Uncle Sam's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, aka CISA, has been \"actively hiding information\" about American telecommunications networks' weak security for years, according to Senator Ron Wyden.\nThe Oregon Democrat said he will block the nomination of Sean Plankey to lead the agency until CISA releases an unclassified 2022 report on the matter.\nWyden, a senior member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been urging CISA to make public the report , \"US Telecommunications Insecurity 2022,\" since July of that year. And while the cyber-agency finally allowed Wyden's staff to read the missive in 2023, the full document has yet to be disclosed to the public.\nIn a statement to The Register , Wyden said he personally asked Jen Easterly to release the document during a phone call last February. However, the then-CISA director \"continued to stonewall my requests until she left office.\"\nWyden also wrote a letter to then-President Joe Biden in February 2024 about flaws in American communications networks that foreign governments are understood to be exploiting to remotely spy on and monitor people's wireless devices.\nThe vulnerabilities exist in that old chestnut, Signaling System Number 7 (SS7) and its pal Diameter, which are protocols used by fixed and mobile network operators to interconnect their networks.\nThese protocols' security weaknesses have been known for years , and allow snoops breaking into telcos or rogue insiders to hijack surveillance targets' text messages and calls and monitor their whereabouts. Wyden wants to see some form of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US wireless carriers to ensure spies aren't abusing SS7 and Diameter implementations to silently keep tabs on Americans via their cellphones.\n\"Surveillance companies and their authoritarian foreign government customers have exploited lax security in US and foreign phone networks for at least a decade to track phones anywhere in the world,\" Wyden said in the 2024 letter to Biden.\nUntil CISA ends its \"multi-year cover up of the phone companies' negligent cybersecurity\" – which Wyden also blames for the Salt Typhoon intrusions during which Beijing's spies were in a position to get their hands on millions of citizens' call records, internet activities, and private texts – the senator said he won't let Plankey's nomination move forward.\n\"Congress and the American people have a right to read this report, and until CISA releases it, I must object to this nomination,\" Wyden said.\nA CISA spokesperson declined to comment.\nPresident Donald Trump last month nominated Plankey to be CISA Director, who needs to be confirmed by the Senate before he can assume the leadership role.\nUnder Senate rules any one lawmaker can place an unlimited hold on a federal nominee, and this type of blockage can be used as leverage against the executive branch.\nWyden pulled a similar maneuver in 2018, blocking the nomination of Trump's first CISA lead, Chris Krebs, until Homeland Security agreed to hand over information about surveillance on American's mobile devices. ®\nCISA-note Speaking of the cyber-agency, President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order stripping any security clearances from former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor and ex-CISA boss Chris Krebs, and directing the Dept of Justice to investigate the pair .\nTrump is still upset that Krebs said, correctly, the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost, was won fair and square by Joe Biden, with no outside interference in the process.\nGet our Tech Resources",
