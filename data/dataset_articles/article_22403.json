  "text": "The effects of climate change often hit Michigan's most vulnerable communities hardest, prompting state environmental organizations to take action. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy has launched the \" Michigan Justice40 Accelerator \" program in partnership with Elevate and the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition. Under the initiative, 25 nonprofit organizations in underserved areas across the state will apply to receive funding and technical support to access federal money for clean-energy projects. Regina Strong, Michigan's environmental justice public advocate, explained what the groups will accomplish over a 12-month period. \"Build capacity and learn the ins and outs of ways to apply for federal and state money, and all the things they need to hopefully address the challenges in the communities where they exist,\" Strong outlined. Strong noted communities interested in assistance need to apply by Aug. 1. Organizations must present an idea for addressing climate change in their community, which could include projects related to resilient infrastructure, clean energy and energy efficiency. Frontline communities in the climate change battle often include people of color, Indigenous groups, and low-income residents. Strong explained funding through the new program also empowers nonprofit organizations and those working toward nonprofit status, to lead efforts in tackling environmental disparities. \"They often are less able to rebound when we have our heavy storms and rain -- there's flooding, or there's an emergency with air,\" Strong observed. \"Oftentimes, these are communities that are already impacted by other challenges.\" Strong added parallel to the new program, The Office of Environmental Justice, Public Advocate has a $20 million grant opportunity available for the same communities. The deadline to apply for funding is July 15.
