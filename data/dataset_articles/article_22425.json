This marks the first time SK Geo Centric has produced renewable p-xylene (PX), a raw material for synthetic fiber polyester, based on recycled materials.\nRenewable PX is processed through the production lines of petrochemical and textile companies within the consortium to create polyester, which is then used in products by Goldwin's outdoor brand, The North Face.\nGreenhouse gas emissions from producing final apparel products from renewable naphtha are reduced by 80-85% compared to using fossil fuels.\nThe consortium companies plan to explore further applications for sustainable polyester.\nWrite to Woo-Sub Kim at\nMore to Read\n-\nWaste managementSK Geo reconsiders extent of $1.3 bn plastic recycling plant project\nMay 02, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)2 Min read\n-\nChemical IndustrySK Geo Centric, Youlchon Chemical to develop recyclable plastic\nApr 01, 2024 (Gmt+09:00)1 Min read\n-\nChemical IndustrySK Geo breaks ground on $1.4 bn plastic recycling cluster\nNov 15, 2023 (Gmt+09:00)3 Min read\n-\nESGSK Geo Centric switches to recycled materials for petchem packaging\nNov 06, 2023 (Gmt+09:00)1 Min read\n-\nChemical IndustrySK Geo Centric to supply recycled plastic materials to Amcor\nOct 26, 2023 (Gmt+09:00)1 Min read\nComment 0",
