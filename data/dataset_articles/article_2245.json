  "text": "Normal Police Dept. issues warning on jury duty scams\nThe scam is a phone call saying that you missed a court date and now have an arrest warrant issued against you\nNORMAL (\n25News Now) - Normal Police are informing residents to watch out for a jury duty scam.\nThe scam goes like this: A person gets a phone call from someone claiming to be with a person’s local police department. The phone number may even look legitimate.\nThe caller will say that they missed their jury duty date and because of this, there is now a warrant out for their arrest.\nThey will then say that all is not lost if they simply pay their fine now. They will ask for this to be done over the phone, using gift cards, Bitcoin, or another payment method.\nIf this happens, Normal Police recommend hanging up, finding the official number for the local police department or courthouse, and calling them to see if any of the phone call is true.\nNormal Police said law enforcement will never call and ask for any type of payment over the phone.\nYou can watch\n25News - any newscast, anywhere - streaming LIVE on 25NewsNow.com, our 25News mobile app, and on our WEEK 25News SmartTV streaming app. Learn more about how you can get connected to 25News streaming live news here.\nCopyright 2025 WEEK.
