  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Udupi (TP) Udupi, Jul 5: An awareness program focused on preventing and controlling dengue fever was conducted at Kodankoor Ward and Varambally fish market, Brahmavar, on July 5. Led by Dr Vidyakumari, Udupi deputy commissioner, the campaign emphasized the importance of designated ‘Dry Days’ every Friday to combat mosquito breeding, which contributes to the spread of dengue. Dr K Vidyakumari, along with Dr I P Gadad, district health and family welfare officer, Rayappa, municipal commissioner, Dr Prashant Bhat, district malaria control officer, and Dr Vasudev Bhat, taluk health officer, actively participated in the awareness drive.
