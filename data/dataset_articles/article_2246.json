  "text": "Another Tesla has fallen victim to vandalism—this time in a quiet Saanich neighbourhood—and the entire incident was caught on the vehicle’s built-in security camera.\nAccording to Saanich Police, the incident occurred just after 4 p.m. on March 5th in the 1600-block of Alderwood Street, a residential area near the University Heights shopping complex.\nThe Tesla, a sleek black model, was keyed by an unknown man who casually walked past the parked vehicle and scraped its side. Unbeknownst to him, the car’s Sentry Mode surveillance system was silently recording everything.\nA clear image of the suspect has since been captured and released to the public.\n“Dear suspect, We just wanted to let you know that just because someone owns ‘A’ Tesla doesn’t mean they ‘OWN’ Tesla,” said Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers in a cheeky but direct post on social media Wednesday.\n“Please stop damaging innocent people’s vehicles,” they added. “As a result of your actions, the Saanich Police would like to have ‘A’ conversation with you.”\nPolice are asking anyone who may recognize the suspect or have information about the incident to contact Saanich Police or report anonymously through Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).\nThis latest case of vandalism follows a similar incident in downtown Victoria late last month, when a Tesla Cybertruck was keyed in the 800-block of Humboldt Street.\nThat suspect was arrested by VicPD on April 6th in the 1000-block of Pakington Street after a tip from the public. They were released shortly after with a promise to appear in court at a later date. Police have recommended a charge of mischief under $5,000, though nothing has yet been sworn by Crown Counsel.\nThis is the third reported case of a Tesla being vandlaized and police believe the crimes may be driven by anti-Tesla or anti-Elon Musk sentiment, with some targeting the brand out of dissent for the billionaire’s political ties and business practices.\nAs Tesla vehicles become more common—and as their cameras continue to quietly record—the likelihood of catching vandals in the act appears to be rising, much to the benefit of owners and investigators alike.",
