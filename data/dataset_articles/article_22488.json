  "text": "( MENAFN - KNN India) New Delhi, Jul 5 (KNN) A four-day Global Conclave on Plastic Recycling and Sustainability (GCPRS) commenced Thursday at Bharat Mandapam, Pragati Maidan, focusing on addressing the global challenge of plastic waste management.\nThe event, jointly organised by the All India Plastics Manufacturers Association (AIPMA) and the Chemicals & Petrochemicals Manufacturers' Association (CPMA), brings together industry leaders, start-ups, and environmental experts to discuss innovative solutions and sustainable practices.\nNivedita Shukla Verma, Secretary, Chemicals and Fertilisers, inaugurated the conclave, highlighting the plastic industry's significant economic contributions while acknowledging the need for sustainable practices.\nVerma noted that only 10 per cent of plastic waste globally is currently recycled, emphasising the urgency for collaborative efforts to address this issue.\nThe Indian government's initiatives, including the Plastic Waste Management Rules introduced in 2016 and subsequent amendments, were outlined as steps towards curbing plastic pollution.\nThese measures mandate extended producer responsibility and enforce stricter recycling standards.\nMercy Epao, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), expressed support for the cause and announced plans to establish a state-of-the-art export centre in Hyderabad, encouraging stakeholders to utilise benefits extended by the ministry.\nIndia's plastic recycling industry, projected to reach USD 6.9 billion by 2033, boasts a current recycling rate of approximately 60 per cent.\nThe conclave aims to address critical issues in plastic waste management and explore sustainable alternatives such as biodegradable and compostable plastics.\nThe event features an exhibition showcasing innovative recycling technologies and efficient waste management solutions.\nA CEO-level roundtable and panel discussions on plastic waste recycling in various industries are also scheduled.\nAs environmental regulations tighten globally, the conclave serves as a platform for dialogue and collaboration among value chain participants and governments to develop effective solutions for plastic waste management and promote a sustainable circular economy.\n(KNN Bureau)\nMENAFN05072024000155011030ID1108409751",
