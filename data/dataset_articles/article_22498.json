  "text": "site.btaStudents From Vocational High School of Transport in Burgas Make Solar Charging Station For Electric Cars Students from the Vocational High School of Transport in Burgas made a solar charging station for electric cars in the yard of their school, said their principal, Krasimir Kanchev. on Friday. The charging station will also be used to power the school air conditioning system in winter and summer. \"Initially, the idea was to protect the school cars from the weather, to build a shed and park there the three new school cars. However, the eighth graders came up with the idea that we could make a solar charging station. The students made the design, calculated how many panels would be needed and build the charging station\", Kanchev said. The 10 KW charging station uses 16 solar panels. It will also be equipped with a hybrid inverter and a charging station for the new school electric car. \"In the process of building the solar station, we saw another opportunity. The energy obtained can also be used by the nearby public charging station for electric cars, especially in the summer, when the students are on vacation,\" Kanchev added. The project used solely the school's own funding to be implemented. The main motivation of the students is to contribute to the protection of the environment by using renewable energy sources. At the beginning of June, students from the same high school participated in a competition for hydrogen-powered cars. In the race, their car lasted over 4 hours on a single charge. /NF/ news.modal.header news.modal.text",
