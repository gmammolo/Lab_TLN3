  "text": "Yesterday (July 4), uThukela District Municipality welcomed brand new water tankers that are expected to relieve the water crisis in the area. This comes after the community has been complaining and asking where uThukela’s water tankers are when their taps run dry.\nIn a statement, uThukela executive support manager Siyabonga Masoka said, “A few days ago, the municipality took the decision to sell all the old water tanker trucks that were constantly breaking down. Today, our honourable mayor, Ntandoyenkosi Shabalala, has welcomed these water tankers as one of the solutions to the challenges faced by uThukela District Municipality.”\nAlso read: Young Elephant to play at top level next season\nThe mayor pleads with the communities to work together with the municipality, as they are busy fixing old damages.\nThe community is hoping that recent steps taken by the municipality will be helpful in eradicating the water shortages in uThukela Municipality at large. uThukela also recently introduced a contractor that will carry out a water infrastructure project with yard connections in the Vimbukhalo area of Bergville. This project is valued at R48 million and 40 locals are expected to be employed.\nClick to receive news links via WhatsApp .
