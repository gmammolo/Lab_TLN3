This initiative aims to tackle potential flood situations in Delhi. The control room, manned by officials from various agencies, will monitor data and initiate relief efforts when necessary. [PTI](/pti-stories)| New Delhi | Updated: 05-07-2024 14:23 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 14:23 IST - Country: - India The Delhi government has proactively set up a 24x7 flood control room to closely monitor real-time data from the Hathni Kund Barrage, which releases Yamuna river water into the city.
