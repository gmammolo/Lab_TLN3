  "text": "In a bold move that is shaking the foundations of the racing world, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports are on a mission to unveil the hidden truths behind F1’s finances as part of their groundbreaking lawsuit against NASCAR. The teams are leaving no stone unturned, filing court motions and subpoenas to demand transparency and justice in a legal battle that could change the landscape of motorsports forever.\nWith a recent motion filed in the US District Court of Colorado, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports are aiming to compel Liberty Media, the owner of Formula 1, to disclose crucial financial documents that could potentially expose NASCAR’s inner workings. By delving into F1’s financial details, the teams hope to gather evidence to challenge the France family’s stronghold over NASCAR, accusing them of operating the sport as an illegal monopoly and violating antitrust laws.\nThe ‘yardstick method’ is being employed by the teams, a legal strategy to showcase economic damages and unfair practices within the sport. They are seeking specific revenue numbers from F1, including intricate details on broadcasting, sponsorship, ticket sales, merchandise, and various other revenue streams. The ultimate goal is to shed light on the financial intricacies of the sport and prove their case against NASCAR.\nNot stopping there, the teams are also targeting the NFL, NBA, and NHL in a similar motion filed in the US District Court of New York City. This multi-front legal battle signifies a pivotal moment in the history of motorsports, with high stakes and dramatic implications for all parties involved.\n23XI Racing, co-owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan and racing icon Denny Hamlin, along with Front Row Motorsports, are standing firm against what they perceive as unjust terms in NASCAR’s Charter Agreement. Their refusal to comply and subsequent legal action have sparked a fierce legal showdown that has been unfolding since last year, with no signs of slowing down.\nAs the legal drama intensifies and the battle for transparency rages on, the racing world braces for a seismic shift that could redefine the sport as we know it. Stay tuned as this high-octane legal saga unfolds, with the future of NASCAR hanging in the balance.",
