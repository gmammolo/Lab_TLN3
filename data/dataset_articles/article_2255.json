  "text": "BRADLEY COUNTY, Tenn. — We're learning more about a third party data breach that possibly compromised the information of three local governments.\nWe told you Tuesday that Chattanooga was extending their contract with Nationwide Recovery Services. The same company whose data breach compromised Hamilton County government and City of Chattanooga databases.\nWe learned Wednesday that Bradley County also uses Nationwide Recovery Services and was affected by the breach.\nAdam Lewis, Bradley County Mayor's executive assistant, confirmed to us they were notified in February of the Nationwide data breach.\nWe asked Lewis if they know the number of people affected by the breach.\n\"We are waiting on the full list of those affected from Nationwide Recovery,\" says Lewis. \"Once we know the scope, we'll determine our next steps and obligations.\"\nWe reached out to the Bradley County Attorney to ask for a copy of their notification letter, how many people were affected, and if the county has notified the people affected yet. We have not yet heard back.\nTiming is important here because, by law, the municipalities have 60 days to notify those affected.\nThe letter from NRS to the City of Chattanooga says...\n\"The investigation determined there was unauthorized access.. to the NRS network between July 5th, 2024.. and July 11th 2024.\"\nMayor Tim Kelly's office says they only learned on Friday about the breach's impact on city data.\nThe letter was sent on February 7th, but the city claims they didn't receive it until April 4th.\nWe asked city council member Chip Henderson if they were provided an explanation as to why the notification wasn't received earlier.\n\"We have been sent a letter that, I think, it was sent to the wrong address from the wrong place.\"\nThe City Attorney's office wrote Nationwide Recovery Services on Friday asking them to inform everyone potentially affected and to offer them complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection\n\"We have data breach protection, and NRS is required to immediately notify the city of any discovered data breach of information and notify the customers as well, and then to provide credit protection to the customer if financial data has been compromised.\"\nHamilton County also says the initial letter from NRS was sent to the wrong place, which delayed their timeline.\nDepend on us to update you.",
