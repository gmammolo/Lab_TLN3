  "text": "( MENAFN - Robotics & automation News) Carbon Robotics celebrates more than 10 billion weeds eliminated\nCarbon Robotics , the leader in AI-powered farming, today announced a major milestone: its award-winning fleet of LaserWeeders has eliminated over 10 billion weeds across North America, Australia and Europe since its launch in 2022.\nBy implementing the LaserWeeder, growers can achieve higher profits, substantial reductions in weed control costs and increased control and predictability. Growers can use the LaserWeeder on over 100 different crops, including lettuce, leafy greens, onions, carrots, broccoli and herbs.\nPaul Mikesell, CEO and founder of Carbon Robotics, says:“It would take 100 people 10 years of continuous hand-weeding to eliminate 10 billion weeds.\n“The LaserWeeder has achieved this milestone in just 24 months without using chemical herbicides or hand-pulling, enabling growers to allocate available labor to higher-value tasks that move the needle for their business.”\nWestern Growers Center of Innovation and Technology recently published an independent case study quantifying the results and economic benefits of laserweeding using production data from commercial growers.\nThe case study found that Triangle Farms, a California-based conventional and specialty crop farm, saw up to a 50 percent crop yield increase after one year of using the LaserWeeder.\nCarbon Robotics is revolutionizing farming with its innovative technologies, bringing significant benefits to farmers and earning widespread recognition.\nRecently featured on the 2024 CNBC Disruptor 50 list and having secured a significant investment from NVentures, the venture capital arm of NVIDIA, the company is rapidly expanding globally.\nMENAFN04072024005532012229ID1108407938",
