  "text": "The Student Entrepreneurship Creativity Program team from Universitas Negeri Semarang (UNNES) has created the latest innovation in the world of hair care by utilizing ecoenzymes from onion skins. This team consists of five students from various departments, namely Natalia Arnandita (Aesthetic Education, 2021), Indra Sakti Pangestu (Chemical Engineering, 2021), Nabila Putri (Pharmacy, 2022), Siti Khoiriyah (Development Economics, 2022), and Lilyana (Beauty Management Education, 2021), under the guidance of dr. Eny Widhia Agustin, M.K.M.\nThis innovation presents shampoo in a unique boba form. The Spherification method is used to create boba shampoo, which when broken down turns into a liquid and is ready to use. This creative idea not only provides a new experience in using shampoo, but also brings the benefits of onion skin ecoenzymes which are known to have various properties for healthy hair.\nNatalia Arnandita explained, “The onion skin ecoenzyme that we use is rich in antioxidants and nutrients that are good for hair. “With the boba form, users can easily control the amount of shampoo used, making it more practical and efficient.”\nIndra Sakti Pangestu, from Chemical Engineering, added that the Spherification method was chosen because it can maintain the quality of the shampoo and makes it easier for users to apply the product. “We want to present products that are innovative and useful, and easy for consumers to use,” he said.\nSupervised by Dr. Eny Widhia Agustin, this team hopes that their innovation can become an alternative solution in the hair care industry, as well as providing added value from onion skin waste which has so far been underutilized. “We are proud of what this team has achieved. “They have shown that creativity and science can work together to create products that are useful for society,” said Dr. Eny Widhia Agustin.\nIt is hoped that this boba shampoo product will soon enter the market and become a new choice for consumers who care about hair health and the environment. This innovation not only proves the ability of Semarang State University students to innovate, but also makes a positive contribution to reducing waste and increasing the added value of natural ingredients.",
