Are you using plastic cups? How are you going to reduce all wastage?'”, he told CNA.\nTo better advise customers, the account manager in charge of Greater China and North Asia took up upskilling courses in design and sustainability, with his employer's guidance.\n“They taught us how the entire process in sustainability (works) in planning MICE events - to the point of even (how to) build the exhibition booth and the costs involved,” he said. MICE refers to meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions.\nWith the knowledge he gained, he is now able to clearer understand potential clients’ needs and help them plan their activities better.",
