(ANI File Photo) New Delhi: A 24/7 flood control room has been set up by the Delhi government to monitor real-time data from the Hathni Kund Barrage from where Yamuna water is released to Delhi.\nDelhi government ministers, Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj, made an announcement at a joint press conference in New Delhi. This followed a session of the principal committee tasked with overseeing, advising, and coordinating flood control initiatives in the National Capital Territory.\nThey stated that the flood control room would be staffed by officials from various agencies, such as the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), and the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).\n“Last year, the Yamuna reached to its highest levels in 70 years. The Delhi government is gearing up to tackle any possibility of floods. The control room is in touch with officials at Hathini Kund barrage from where Yamuna river discharge is received. After the release of one lakh cusec of water, relief and rescue machinery starts working,” said Atishi, Delhi water minister.\n“We took the stake of the preparations of Delhi govt and all the concerned departments regarding flood relief and flood control. We hope that the flood situation doesn’t occur in Delhi. But, if the level of water in Yamuna rises, Delhi govt is ready to deal with that,” said Atishi.\nMinister for Health-Urban Development Saurabh Bharadwaj said the control room will monitor data in real-time and will be entirely computerised.\n(With PTI inputs)",
