  "text": "Three endangered lion cubs have been born at Fota Wildlife Park in Cork. The male Asiatic cubs were delivered on June 5th by six-year-old Arya, who recently returned from Helsinki Zoo and was previously part of the first lion litter ever born at the park. The cubs' father is eight-year-old Yali, considered the most genetically significant lion in the European Breeding Programme due to his rare DNA. Fota Wildlife Park lead ranger Julien Fonteneau said the cubs are vital to “global efforts in preserving the Asiatic lion population”. “In a first for Fota Wildlife Park, Yali was present at the birth of his three cubs. Normally, male lions do not attend the birth of their young,\" he said. \"One of our team members here quipped that Yali is a very modern father.\" Mr Fonteneau praised Arya’s performance as a first-time mother, noting she is “excelling” and \"very protective\" of her cubs. “We have been monitoring the cubs daily, and they all appear to be well-fed and active,” he said. “She has been caring for the cubs outdoors under the foliage and out of sight. “Whenever it rains, she carries them to the heated lion shelter, which our visitors know well. “While they are still very young and sleeping a lot, it is possible to catch a glimpse of them at the lion shelter.” Endangered lions The Asiatic lion is classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and inhabits only one remaining site in the world, the Gir Forest in India, which has an estimated population of around 500 to 600 lions. Fota Wildlife Park is calling on the public to help name the three male cubs - which can be done so by clicking here - for an opportunity to win one of three annual conservation passes.
