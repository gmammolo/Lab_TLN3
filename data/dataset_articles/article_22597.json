  "text": "IN celebration of World Environment Month, Grosvenor Library hosted an impactful talk on June 28, focusing on land restoration, desertification and drought resilience.\nAlso read: Environmentalists, communities take a stand against climate change\nThemed ‘Our Land, Our Future,’ the event was a joint effort between Grosvenor Library and Cleansing and Solid Waste (CSW), with support from the City’s Parks, Recreation and Culture unit, and biodiversity units.\nLibrarian Somikazi Bonani underscored the event’s significance, stating its purpose was to raise awareness about plastic pollution and environmental protection while promoting the preservation of essential environmental assets. “This commemoration aims to create awareness and educate the public on the vital importance of preserving our environment for future generations,” Bonani remarked.\nDr Aubrey Muswema shows the audience the process of a new brick project. The event featured a panel of environmental experts from various departments who discussed pressing environmental challenges and strategies for preserving valuable assets. Preston Chetty, education and waste minimisation officer at CSW, highlighted the importance of waste management. “The purpose of the day is to encourage residents to handle and dispose of their waste in an environmentally sound manner and to practice waste minimisation at a household level,” Chetty stated.\nDr Aubrey Muswema, a senior researcher in the Sustainability, Economics and Waste Research Group (SEW RG), introduced innovative projects aimed at promoting a greener and more sustainable future. Among the exciting developments he shared was a concept for a brick made from glass and building rubble, showcasing a creative approach to recycling and waste management.\nParks Department’s Martin Clement shares some of the ongoing projects the department has to promote a green and more sustainable future. The event also featured Martin Clement and Sthobile Mkhize from the Parks Department and eThekwini, who provided valuable insights on how individuals can contribute to sustainability efforts in their daily lives. They encouraged attendees to adopt greener practices and introduce more sustainable habits in their communities.\nFor more Southlands Sun news, follow us on Facebook or Twitter.
