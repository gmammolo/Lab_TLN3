  "text": "GAINESVILLE – Above a spartan field near the Oklahoma border, scant clouds skate across the North Texas sky. Hundreds of solar panels slowly track the morning sun’s path for a direct hit from an energy source 94 million miles away. But not the sheep. They’re tracking JR Howard’s gray Ford F-250 — weaving between rows of solar panels as he lays on the horn. It’s feeding time on this April morning.\nWhy This Story Matters Texas lost almost 18,000 farms and ranches, and more than 1.5 million acres of agricultural land, from 2017-22. Wind and solar power can provide a second income to keep more farmers and ranchers in business. Advertisement Howard, owner of Texas Solar Sheep , has found himself part of a burgeoning industry combining Texans’ ranching sensibilities with the ascendancy of solar energy , a booming electricity source.\nAdvertisement The sheep here — white Dorpers — are not known for their wool. They’re here for their appetites, chomping away at the vegetation growing alongside the panels. If some get sold for slaughter, all the better.",
