  "text": "During the summer months, Rebecca Cook of Phoenixville enjoys most getting her physical activity in later in the day, after work, when temperatures have fallen. While taking in the outdoor surroundings, she also uses it as a time to indulge in a little entertainment.\nRebecca Cook enjoys taking walks at parks during the summer months to get exercise and take in a change of scenery. (Rebecca Cook / For MediaNews Group) “I like walking around Reeves’ Park in Phoenixville, usually while listening to podcasts, audiobooks and music,” Cook said.\nSometimes she’ll venture to hiking trails for a change of scenery, such as the Schuylkill River Trail. She more recently visited Ridley Creek State Park.\n“I did the hiking trail with a friend and loved it,” she said. “It was very shady and right along a stream that we could dip our toes in.”\nRidley Creek State Park is made up of more than 2,606 acres of Delaware County woodlands and meadows. With Ridley Creek running through it, the park is open every day of the year from sunrise to sunset. They have restrooms and picnic areas.\nVariety of habitats Located under an hour from Pottstown, the 13 miles of trails at Ridley Creek State Park take you through a variety of habitats. Trails are rated “easiest,” for beginner trail users, offering a gentle grade with few obstacles. “More difficult” trails offer a steeper grade and trails that are narrower with embedded rocks on the surface of the trail.\nCook and her friend had a chance to dip their toes in the creek at Ridley Creek State Park. (Rebecca Cook / For MediaNews Group) Their “most difficult” trails are for trail users with advanced skills, offering a steep grade and a physical challenge. “Most difficult” routes aren’t as well marked and elevation gain or loss should be expected to be severe.\nThe Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Resources highlights eight trails ranging from .34 miles up to 4.7 miles. The “Mansion Garden Trail” is 1 mile and is in the “easiest” category.\n“This paved loop is accessed near the parking lot at the mansion and travels around the historic gardens and mansion area,” the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Resources states on its website, referring to Hunting Hill Manor, which is a large, English Country Manor.\nGreat views Walks through neighborhood parks offer a good outlet for physical activity during the summer months. (Pexel / For MediaNews Group) The park’s Sycamore Mills Road Trail is another in the ‘easiest’ category that offers some nice scenery to take in.\n“This paved, multi-use trail travels through the woods, by the agricultural fields, and next to Ridley Creek,” the PDCR states. “It offers great views, easy exercising, and great fishing opportunities.”\nWhether hitting a trail or park, Cook, who works at the Chester Springs Library in Chester County, enjoys spending time outdoors during the summer months for multiple reasons.\n“I like how green and alive everything is,” she said. “It’s also a good excuse to sit outside with iced tea and a book.”\nCook spotted a duck in the creek during her recent visit to Ridley Creek State Park. (Rebecca Cook / For MediaNews Group) Free Community Bike Share Program When Cook was in college, she got most of her physical activity through biking.\n“I liked biking because it was a more affordable and efficient way to get around, and you also get to notice more about the city you’re living in,” she said.\nIf you don’t have a bike and you’re 16 or older with a valid driver’s license, don’t let that hold you back from exploring the beauty of the community. With the Free Community Bike Share Program that’s managed by the Schuylkill River Greenways National Heritage Area, you can borrow a bike to cycle along the Schuylkill River, run an errand, or ride to a historic site — free — all while getting fit and having fun in the process.\nFor more information, visit www.bikeschuylkill.org or www.takeitoutdoorsadventures.com\nAmong several locations where you can pick up bikes is Take it Outdoors, located in Riverfront Park near the Riverfront Rotary pavilion. Open Wednesday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.",
