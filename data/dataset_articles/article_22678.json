  "text": "Thanks to the non-governmental organization (NGO) \"Medija Team\", the Maidan on Lukovo, about 12 kilometers from Nikšić, is slowly taking on the shape of an eco-park from a landfill. During the ecological action in which, in addition to the mentioned NGO, representatives of the local administration, the Tourist Organization (TO) Nikšić, non-governmental organizations and local people took part, 11 cypress trees were planted, ecological benches, a signpost, an info board... \"We planted 11 cypress trees as a sign of symbolism, because 11 actors took part in the action, and we are talking about a type of tree that can survive in this area. Thanks to the support of the Secretariat for Communal Affairs and Water Supply, we also provided a fountain at the site of the eco-park. The action is also an indicator that with the synergy of the non-governmental and civil sector and local self-government representatives, we can do a lot to preserve the biodiversity of this area and its tourism valorization\", said Duško Marković, director of \"Media Team\". According to him, the implemented action is the final activity of the project \"Let it be clean, that I drive safely\", which was implemented by that NGO with the support of the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs, as well as the local administration and TO Nikšić. As part of the project, as in previous years, the \"Media Team\" organized several cleaning and reforestation actions on the Maidan, all with the aim of turning the devastated area, from which gravel and sand had been exploited for more than four decades, into an eco-park and form the Lukovo eco-zone. The road that leads to the Vučje ski center is in bad condition, while about 120 meters of the road next to the Maidan is collapsed and poses a danger to all road users, so the \"Media Team\" hopes that it will be repaired in due course. The non-governmental organizations \"Medija team\" and \"Agro eko Lukovo\" launched an initiative to protect the mentioned area, and they also received support from the municipal Secretariat for Spatial Planning and Environmental Protection.
