  "text": "Hundreds of Statesboro residents forced to vacate their homes at the Vault apartments\nSTATESBORO, Ga. (WTOC) - Hundreds of residents at The Vault apartments in Statesboro received a notice in the form of a letter on their doors on Monday saying that they had to vacate their homes by Friday.\nFamilies and students have been moving out of their apartments since a letter was delivered to their doorsteps saying they had to vacate their homes due to the city deeming the apartments on the property to be structurally unsafe.\nA few residents told WTOC they don’t have anywhere to go and that they can’t afford to stay in a hotel this short notice.\n“So, where does that leave everybody else? Homeless.”\nOthers say they didn’t learn that they had to move out until today.\n“She texted me and she said what are you going to do for housing? I said what are you talking about and she said The Vault is closing.”\nGeorgia Southern student Christina Colley says she’s lucky because she is a senior at Georgia Southern and was moving out soon anyway.\nHowever, she says she has made several complaints to management in the past about her apartment.\n“The second year my lease started, it just went so downhill and even if you ask management to come fix something, they didn’t. They would be like we don’t have management right now, so it’s been going downhill ever since the second year I started my lease.”\nIn the letter The Vault management gave residents, it says the city of Statesboro asked them to vacate every resident.\nHowever, in the letter issued by the city to The Vault, it states that the apartment complex has ten days to come up with a plan or actions to fix the apartment buildings.\nThe city of Statesboro was prompted to send this letter after inspections were done by engineering consultants deemed the buildings to be unsafe and too deteriorated for healthy living.\nDifferent resources in the Statesboro community have reached out to aid the residents with different open housing options, temporary free healthcare, and different options for free meals.\nWTOC reached out to the Vault management who declined to comment.\nCopyright 2025 WTOC.
