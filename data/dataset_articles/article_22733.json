  "text": "Protecting Our Planet: Mapping the Path to Biodiversity Conservation A recent World Bank study, titled \"Revisiting Global Biodiversity: A Spatial Analysis of Species Occurrence Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,\" sheds important light on the spatial distribution of global biodiversity. Using advanced mapping techniques, the research identifies key areas for species protection, highlighting the importance of endemism and the vulnerability of species with small occurrence regions. This data-driven approach aims to guide effective conservation strategies, aligning with global efforts to protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030. [CoE-EDP, VisionRI](/Home/AuthorArticles?fl=CoE-EDP, VisionRI)| Updated: 05-07-2024 17:11 IST | Created: 05-07-2024 17:11 IST In a world facing unprecedented biodiversity loss, new research by the World Bank provides a glimmer of hope by using advanced mapping techniques to identify and protect crucial species. The study, \"Revisiting Global Biodiversity: A Spatial Analysis of Species Occurrence Data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,\" reveals groundbreaking insights into the spatial distribution of global biodiversity, aiming to guide effective conservation strategies. The Biodiversity Crisis Biodiversity is plummeting at an alarming rate, with species extinction occurring at least 1,000 times faster than natural background rates. This stark reality is highlighted by the Living Planet Index, which has recorded a 69% decline in vertebrate populations since 1970. In response to such dire statistics, 188 governments ratified the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) at the COP 15 conference in December 2022, committing to protect 30% of the planet by 2030. However, the challenge remains: how to identify which areas of global biodiversity should be prioritized for protection? Mapping Global Biodiversity The study utilizes data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), an extensive repository of georeferenced species occurrence records. Over the past 15 years, GBIF has grown to include data on more than 2 million species, with 1.3 million new records added daily. Researchers employed a sophisticated mapping algorithm to create occurrence maps for over 600,000 species, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, and other organisms. This algorithm, known as alphahull, constructs detailed, non-convex boundaries around reported species locations, allowing for rapid updates and accurate representations of species distributions. Key Findings The results of this mapping effort are impressive. The algorithm successfully estimated maps for 92.9% of the species in the database. This includes: 52,433 vertebrates 213,268 arthropods 32,355 mollusks 24,109 other animals 232,693 plants 38,122 fungi 17,714 other species Comparing these algorithm-generated maps with expert-drawn maps for mammals, ants, and vascular plants revealed similar global patterns of species density. The discrepancies that did arise were due to technical differences, such as new occurrence reports and varying estimation methods. The Importance of Endemism Endemism, where species are found exclusively in specific geographic locations, is a critical factor in conservation. The study found that 44.6% of species are endemic to one country, a figure that rises to 55.6% when the endemism criterion is relaxed to include species that are 90% resident in one country. Countries like Australia, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, China, New Zealand, Madagascar, Japan, and Costa Rica emerged as top locales for endemic species. Protecting Vulnerable Species The study also highlighted the plight of species with small occurrence regions, identifying approximately 118,000 such species at significant risk of extinction. These species often exhibit patterns of spatial clustering, suggesting specific areas where conservation efforts could be most effective. Protecting these small-occurrence region species requires balancing resource allocation, securing protected territories, and minimizing economic opportunity costs. This comprehensive analysis underscores the urgent need for updated species maps and robust conservation planning. By leveraging GBIF data and advanced mapping algorithms, the study offers valuable insights into the spatial distribution of species, the importance of endemism, and the vulnerability of species with small occurrence regions. As the world strives to meet the ambitious goals set by the Kunming-Montreal GBF, such data-driven approaches will be crucial in guiding effective and sustainable biodiversity conservation efforts. - FIRST PUBLISHED IN: - Devdiscourse ALSO READ [Iberian Lynx Bounces Back: A Conservation Triumph](/article/science-environment/2989124-iberian-lynx-bounces-back-a-conservation-triumph) [SA Seeks Public Input on Revised Rhino Biodiversity Management Plan](/article/science-environment/2989312-sa-seeks-public-input-on-revised-rhino-biodiversity-management-plan) [New Genus of Diatom Discovered in Eastern Ghats Rivers Enhances Understanding of India's Unique Biodiversity](/article/science-environment/2989374-new-genus-of-diatom-discovered-in-eastern-ghats-rivers-enhances-understanding-of-indias-unique-biodiversity) [India-Bangladesh Mega Project: Boosting Ties with Teesta River Conservation and Trade Pact Talks](/article/business/2991889-india-bangladesh-mega-project-boosting-ties-with-teesta-river-conservation-and-trade-pact-talks) [Committed to conservation of tigers, elephants: Yogi govt](/article/headlines/2991779-committed-to-conservation-of-tigers-elephants-yogi-govt)",
