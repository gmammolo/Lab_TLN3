  "text": "The International Union of Architects (UIA) and the UN-Habitat have announced the names of regional finalists for the award that celebrates excellence in design and sustainable construction practices in line with relevant SDGs The race for the second edition of the International Union of Architects (UIA) award has entered the next level with the announcement of regional finalists from the first stage of the competition. The UIA and UN-Habitat select projects that exhibit the finest design qualities and the highest standards of sustainable construction for this coveted biennial award. The criteria is adherence to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They are a celebration of architects who contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the New Urban Agenda. The regional finalists will now vie for the award in Stage 2 with three-minute video presentations that explain in detail how their projects align with the relevant SDGs. During stage 1, architects and builders from across the UIA footprint were evaluated regionally. The five UIA regions are Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, and Africa. Winners in each of the six will be awarded a medal. Cairo, Egypt, will host the awards function at the twelfth session of the World Urban Forum from November 4-8, 2024.",
