  "text": "A group of suspected cultists stormed a football viewing centre on Coca-Cola Road in Ilorin West Local Government Area of Kwara State on Wednesday night, killing a 19-year-old man and injuring two others with stray bullets.\nIt was gathered that the incident occurred around 9:05 p.m. while fans were watching a football match.\nA source described the terrifying scene, noting that the attackers opened fire indiscriminately, causing panic and chaos.\n“They just came out of nowhere and started shooting. People ran in different directions. It was like a war zone,” a source who witnessed the attack told SaharaReporters under the condition of anonymity.\nThe 19-year-old victim, whose identity has yet to be officially confirmed, was reportedly shot in the head and died instantly.\n“He was lying in a pool of blood. It was a horrifying sight,” the source added.\nThe two other individuals who sustained gunshot wounds were immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for medical attention.\n“I heard a gunshot and had to turn back immediately. My wife’s shop is located at that place. A young man was hit by a stray bullet and was lying in a pool of blood,” he said.\nThe source added that he approached police officers conducting a stop-and-search operation under the A-Division bridge to alert them.\n“I met some police officers under the bridge where they were doing stop and search. I told them about the incident, and they said they would mobilise to the scene,” he narrated.\nHowever, the extent of police intervention remains unclear as at the time of filing this report.\nEfforts by SaharaReporters to get comments from the spokesperson for the Kwara State Police Command, SP Adetoun Ejire-Adeyemi, were unsuccessful.\nShe neither answered phone calls nor replied to a text message sent to her.\nSource: Sahara Reporters",
