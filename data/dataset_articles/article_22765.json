  "text": "Are those some spots I see in the mirror? Must be the teens. GamingOnLinux, the website, is another year older today and I'm still blown away by what we've achieved together. 15 years! I can hardly believe it. This year, amazingly, I don't have a whole lot to talk about for this article. Why? Well, things are — great? Looking back over the years of website birthdays at things I've talked about we've been through the Steam Machines, Proton, Steam Deck and so much more. Right now, it's the best Linux gaming has ever been. It's easier than ever. What a fantastic place to be in.
