  "text": "In Ontario, the concept of \"strawberry season\" is undergoing a transformation, with strawberries making their appearance in stores earlier than usual. This change is attributed to the advancements in hydroponic cultivation within the expansive greenhouse complexes in Leamington, Ontario, which have enabled the production of strawberries nearly all year round. These developments are largely driven by the low Canadian dollar, the proximity to the American border, and a local culture of skilled cultivation, particularly among Italian growers. The region's greenhouse industry, not limited to strawberries but also extending to other crops, benefits the U.S. Midwest significantly.\nTraditionally, Ontario strawberries are \"June bearing,\" with a lifecycle that includes flowering in May and fruiting in June/July. However, the varieties now being cultivated in Leamington, such as the \"everbearing\" type, allow for a continuous harvest over several months. This method of cultivation presents a shift from the seasonal pattern of strawberry production, offering strawberries outside their traditional harvest period.\nThe impact of these innovations on the market is notable, with concerns arising about the potential effects on field growers in Ontario. The availability of greenhouse-grown strawberries at lower prices and their presence in the market as early as April could disrupt the traditional strawberry season. This development has sparked discussions among industry professionals about the future dynamics of strawberry production and distribution in the region.\nSource:\nfarmersforum.com",
