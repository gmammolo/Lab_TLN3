  "text": "New Delhi [India], July 5 (ANI): South African [Cheetah](/topic/cheetah) ' [Gamini](/topic/gamini)' with her five cubs on Friday morning, enjoyed the [rain](/topic/rain) at [Kuno National Park](/topic/kuno-national-park) in [Madhya Pradesh](/topic/madhya-pradesh) [Sheopur](/topic/sheopur). [Cheetah](/topic/cheetah) [Gamini](/topic/gamini) was seen playing with her cubs, who also engaged in playful antics with each other. Union Minister Bhupender Yadav shared the joyous moment in a post on X, stating, \"Together, they weave a timeless tale of familial harmony amidst nature's seasonal embrace.\" Earlier on March 10, South African [Cheetah](/topic/cheetah) ' [Gamini](/topic/gamini)' gave birth to five cubs at [Kuno National Park](/topic/kuno-national-park). An announcement in this regard was made by Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav on Sunday. The Union Minister said that the total number of Indian-born [Cheetah](/topic/cheetah) cubs has gone up to 13. \"High Five, Kuno! Female cheetah [Gamini](/topic/gamini), age about 5 years, brought from Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa, has given birth to 5 cubs today. This takes the tally of the Indian-born cubs to 13. This is the fourth cheetah litter on Indian soil and the first litter of cheetahs brought from South Africa,\" Bhupender Yadav said in a post on X. He lauded the officers and staff at [Kuno National Park](/topic/kuno-national-park) for ensuring a 'stress-free environment' for the cheetahs. \"Congratulations to all, especially the team of forest officers, vets, and field staff who have ensured a stress-free environment for cheetahs, which has led to successful mating and birth of the cubs. The total number of cheetahs, including cubs in [Kuno National Park](/topic/kuno-national-park), is 26. [Gamini](/topic/gamini)'s legacy leaps forward: Introducing her adorable cubs!\" he said.
