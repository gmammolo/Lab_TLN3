  "text": "BMC workers clean Marine Drive area after T20 World Cup victory parade. (Image: @mybmc) The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) carried out a special cleanliness drive on Thursday at the Marine Drive area after the victory parade of the T20 Cricket World Cup 2024 team. BMC workers cleaned the Marine Drive area overnight after thousands of fans gathered at the area to welcome the champions of the T20 Cricket World Cup as they brought the cup home. The open bus parade started from the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) in Nariman Point after 7.30 pm and went to the Wankhede Stadium. Although it usually takes five minutes to cover the distance between these two points, it took more than one-and-a-half-hour for the parade to do so due to the large gathering. This huge congregation also left behind piles of trash as footwear and water bottles were seen lying scattered on the stretch of road from where the victory parade passed. In a release, the BMC said that along with a large number of wrappers of food items and water bottles, a huge quantity of shoes and chappals (slippers), among other things, were collected during the cleanliness drive. Taking on Twitter, the BMC wrote “After the grand welcome and once the crowd dispersed, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) conducted a special cleanliness drive throughout the night across the entire Marine Drive area.” “The area was thoroughly cleaned and made available for Mumbaikars who visit Marine Drive every morning for a walk,” the BMC added. During the cleanliness drive, the municipal corporation’s Solid Waste Management Department collected waste that filled two large dumpers and five small jeeps.",
