  "text": "LHASA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign participants of a forum in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region have highlighted the region's ecological conservation efforts, calling for increased cooperation and thought exchange.\nThemed \"Promoting the Harmony of Humans and Nature, Sharing the Fruits of Cooperation and Development,\" the fourth China Xizang Trans-Himalaya Forum for International Cooperation concluded on Friday in the city of Nyingchi, having attracted attendees from more than 20 countries and regions.\nSince the first forum in 2018, China has strengthened cooperation with related parties on working toward the goals of protecting Xizang, known as the \"Roof of the World,\" and safeguarding Earth as the home of all people, said Qin Boyong, vice chairperson of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the country's top political advisory body.\nExtensive international cooperation has been undertaken to improve ecological environment governance, promote green development and deepen mutual learning among civilizations, with the aim of promoting high-quality development together with high-level ecological and environmental protection, Qin said at the forum's opening ceremony on Thursday.\nForum attendees exchanged in-depth views on such issues as eco-environmental and cultural protection, tourism development, and highland agriculture and animal husbandry.\nLee Flores Enrique Segundo, a member of the House of Representatives of Chile who is visiting Xizang for the first time, said he has been deeply impressed by the region's cleanliness and the warmth of the local people.\nHe said that Chile faces similar challenges to China, such as developing high-altitude regions without harming the environment.\n\"This forum serves as a valuable learning platform where we can exchange ideas and we also learn from China's policies on enhancing citizen awareness of environmental protection,\" he said.\nIn Xizang, environmental conservation has been prioritized, with a third of the region's land now consisting of nature reserves.\nXizang maintains excellent air quality levels 99 percent of its days, its major rivers and lakes meet or exceed Class III water quality standards, and it has achieved carbon neutrality ahead of schedule, making it a region with one of the best ecological environments in the world, according to Wang Junzheng, secretary of the Communist Party of China Xizang Autonomous Regional Committee.\nThaung Naing Oo, director general of the forest department of Myanmar's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, is making his second visit to Xizang.\nHe said that by observing Xizang's well-preserved natural environment during his two visits, he has gained a deeper understanding of the region's ecological civilization protection concepts.\n\"I think this forum plays a very important role in understanding the important linkage between humans and nature,\" he said.\nVivian Tatiana Camacho Hinojosa, an official of Bolivia's Ministry of Health and Sports, praised Xizang's efforts to balance development with the preservation of tradition.\n\"In Xizang, one can not only see beautiful landscapes but also ancient buildings and culture. It preserves vibrant ancient traditions,\" she said.\nPrevious Trans-Himalayan Forums were held in Nyingchi in 2018, 2019 and 2023, with the third forum seeing the release of an initiative to deepen international cooperation in the Trans-Himalaya region. ■",
