  "text": "Read full article NY Daily News Ex-Def Jam honcho Kevin Liles files to dismiss sexual assault suit Jami Ganz, New York Daily News April 10, 2025 at 12:17 a.m. · 2 min read\nLink Copied\nNEW YORK — Former Def Jam honcho Kevin Liles is filing to dismiss the sexual assault lawsuit brought against him earlier this year for alleged decades-old sexual harassment, assault and rape allegations.\nA woman identified only as Jane Doe sued the 57-year-old music exec in February for allegedly sexually harassing her during her employment at Def Jam, from 2000 to 2002 , culminating in an eventual alleged sexual assault and rape, TMZ previously reported. Liles denied the “outrageous” allegations as “shameful … lies” in a statement issued to the outlet at the time.\nLawyers for Liles on Tuesday requested Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald dismiss the case with prejudice, citing the “entirely false” allegations and an expired statute of limitations, according to legal documents filed in New York and obtained by the Daily News.\nPrior to Doe’s “patently false and untimely lawsuit,” Liles’ legal team says he never faced allegations of “sexual impropriety.”\nADVERTISEMENT Given that Doe says she was raped in 2002, Liles’ lawyers also maintain the alleged assault occurred outside of New York’s statute of limitations, over a year past its “‘look-back’ window for reviving such time-barred claims.”\nIn its own filing to Judge Buchwald, also viewed by The News, UMG Recordings argues it can’t be held liable for the claims against Liles. If he did what he’s accused of, the company says, “the alleged conduct was indisputably not in furtherance of any business of UMGR.”\nLiles’ camp also maintains that Doe “offers zero factual bases for her salacious allegations” and that her claims are too broad and vague.\nThey point to the “unspecified ‘derogatory and degrading comments based on her gender regarding her body and appearance'” he’d allegedly mak. Such vagueness, they say, also applies to Doe’s “threadbare” description of the alleged sexual assault and rape “spanning only three paragraphs.”\nDoe filed her lawsuit in late February — which said UMG and Def Jam “not only knew or should have known” of the alleged conduct and Liles’ alleged “propensity” to commit it — shortly after Liles’ September departure from Warner Music’s 300 Elektra Entertainment, which he co-founded.\nADVERTISEMENT Liles said he’d stay on board through year’s end to assist with the transition, per memos obtained by Variety at the time.\nThe client roster at 300, of which Liles was also CEO, includes the likes of Mary J. Blige and Megan Thee Stallion. Liles’ departure was announced following that of other Warner execs.",
