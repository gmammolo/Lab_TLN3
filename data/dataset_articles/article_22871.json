  "text": "The Advanced Media Broadcasting System (AMBS), which operates ALLTV, launched its Panalo sa ALLTV promo on July 1 to give viewers a chance to win a brand-new house and lot every week.\nAMBS management announced the promo through its official website, https://www.facebook.com/alltvph/, and social media pages.\nEight lucky winners will be drawn during the promo period to win a house and lot package from Vista Land. Additionally, twenty viewers can win P500 each day.\nThe promo runs from July 1 until August 26. ALLTV will flash QR codes and “words of the day” throughout its programming, from 12:00 noon to 11:15 p.m.\nOnce they scan the QR code, participants will be directed to the ALLTV promo site to fill out a form. The form requires their full name (as it appears on a government-issued ID), full address, email address, birth date, and mobile number.\nAs part of the entry process, viewers are also required to upload a selfie. To read the full mechanics, visit https://www.facebook.com/alltvph/.\nALLTV airs popular programs like the country’s longest-running TV newscast TV Patrol and variety show It’s Showtime.\nViewers can also enjoy classic television programs produced by ABS-CBN through Jeepney TV, which is part of ALLTV’s daily offerings.\nALLTV can be watched on various channels depending on your cable provider: Channel 2 (Free TV at Planet Cable); Channel 35 (Cignal and Skycable- provincial areas); Channel 13 (Skycable in Metro Manila) and Channel 2 (for Sinag, Cablelink, GSAT, and other cable TV).",
