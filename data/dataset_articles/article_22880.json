  "text": "Kannur (Kerala) [India], July 5 (ANI): Kerala climate activist, Kallur Balan, popularly known as 'green man', for planting and nurturing lakhs of trees along the roadsides has taken up another mission of providing food and water to wild animals and birds. There is no denying that the man from the Kallur region of the Palakkad district of Kerela has devoted his whole life to the forest and its animals in that region. Velu Balakrishnan, also known as the 'Kallur Balan', even at the age of 74, is still doing his duty in serving the forest and its animals as his own.

Every day, Balan collects 500 kg of fruits and vegetables to satisfy the hunger of the animals in the forest. After completing his morning routine, where he climbs the mountain and does yoga, Balan leaves with his Jeep to collect fruits by six o'clock in the morning. After travelling for around fifty kilometres, Balan returns with the fruits around eight o'clock.

He distributes the fruits in the Aiyarmala, Kinavallur, Vazhukappara, Mundur, Dhonimala and Walayar areas of the forest, feeds the birds and animals, and also plants saplings. Animals ranging from monkeys, hares, and peacocks to wild boars came out of the forest as soon as they heard the sound of Balan's jeep. Wholesalers from markets in Palakkad to Ottapalam provide Balan with apples, pomegranates, oranges, guavas, bananas, watermelons, jackfruits, and many vegetables, which are edible even if they start to spoil, free of charge to feed the animals. Many acquaintances will also give him money to fuel the jeep. This has been his lifestyle since 2000 and it hasn't changed at all. Over the last 24 years, Balan has spent every day of his life planting and nurturing over 30 lakh tree saplings, which have now grown into magnificent, full-grown trees. He has also planted thousands of trees alongside highways and other public spaces, helping to restore nature's beauty in that region, which was once as dry as a desert. In Arangat, Balan is a Balettan (elder brother) to the locals.
