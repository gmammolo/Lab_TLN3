Jobs, tax revenues, and inclusive economic growth for Nigerian youths. This is the President’s vision.\n“Later on Thursday evening, I hosted a virtual call with the Chief Executive Officer of the G-7’s Climate Investment Funds (CIF), Mrs. Tariye Gbadegesin, which oversees assets and pledges of $11 billion and is focused on climate investments in emerging markets. We held an elaborate discussion on Nigeria’s present and future collaboration with the Fund as we embark on our green industrialization drive”, Ngelale said.\nThese engagements demonstrate Nigeria’s growing appeal to global investors in the renewable energy sector, aligning with President Bola Tinubu’s vision for a sustainable and industrialized economy.",
