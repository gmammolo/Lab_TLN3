  "text": "WASHINGTON (TNND) — Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday called out Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for voting against the Trump administration’s nominee for a top Pentagon position.\nSen. McConnell voted against the confirmation of Elbridge Colby, President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as under secretary of defense for policy. In a statement on his decision, the senator explained Trump’s selection could prove hazardous to the nation.\n“Mr. Colby’s confirmation leaves open the door for the less-polished standard-bearers of restraint and retrenchment at the Pentagon to do irreparable damage to the system of alliances and partnerships which serve as force multipliers to U.S. leadership,” he wrote. “It encourages isolationist perversions of peace through strength to continue apace at the highest levels of Administration policymaking.”\n“Make no mistake,” the senator added. “America will not be made great again by those who are content to manage our decline.”\nTaking to X, the vice president fired back at Sen. McConnell for opposing the Trump administration.\n“Mitch’s vote today—like so much of the last few years of his career—is one of the great acts of political pettiness I’ve ever seen,” he fumed.\nReacting to the post was Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., who said “glad things are changing.”\nSen. McConnell, 83, has already decided not to seek reelection in 2026, marking the end of his lengthy congressional career. The senator in February fell twice at the Capitol, causing him to use a wheelchair as a precaution.\nFollow Jackson Walker on X at @_jlwalker_ for the latest trending national news. Have a news tip?
