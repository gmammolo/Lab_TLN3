  "text": "European Lithium Limited (ASX: EUR, FRA:PF8, OTC: EULIF) ( European Lithium or the Company), is pleased to announce that Obeikan Group for Investment Company ( Obeikan Group ) has executed the Shareholders Agreement.\nEuropean Lithium expects to work with certain of its affiliated entities to construct and commission a large-scale lithium hydroxide processing plant in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to process spodumene concentrate produced from the Wolfsberg Lithium Project located in Austria\nThe 50%/50% JV will be geared towards developing, constructing and commissioning a lithium hydroxide processing plant, and operating the plant for the conversion of lithium spodumene concentrate from Wolfsberg. Under the Shareholders agreement, the newly established Arabian New Energy company (Arabian New Energy) seek to have an exclusive right to purchase spodumene mined from the current resource at Wolfsberg (Zone 1), and the facility is expected to be developed to meet the minimum initial capacity and product specifications based on the Company's binding Long Term Supply Agreement with BMW (refer ASX announcement dated 21 December 2022 ). Under the Shareholders Agreement, and subject to the successful commissioning of the Plant, the Wolfsberg Project Zone 1 will sell the lithium spodumene concentrate to the JV company over the life of the current resources of the Wolfsberg mine at a reduced rate, with a floor and ceiling price subject to final agreement of the parties. The parties will establish a Development Committee for the purpose of jointly collaborating on all key decisions in relation to the development of the Plant. Once Critical Metals Corp (CRML) has signed the Deed of Assignment (refer ASX announcement dated 2 June 2023 ) and the Shareholders Agreement, both agreements will become binding on all parties.\nTony Sage\n, Executive Chairman of EUR said: 'This is another huge milestone for the Wolfsberg project following on from the recent $US15m commitment made by BMW . We now have two very dedicated partners to ensure we fulfil our ambition of becoming the first European producers of both spodumene and hydroxide. Now after these key milestones have been achieved the next steps become a lot easier. Over the next two quarters we expect to finalize the updated DFS on the now separated projects and secure the necessary funding to commence construction. The Board of the newly formed Arabian New Energy will appoint a leading ECPM to oversee the construction of the hydroxide plant. The funding for the project will be organized from within Saudi Arabia ' Abdallah Obeikan, CEO of the Obeikan Investment Group said: 'We are pleased to have reached this agreement with European Lithium . We are convinced that our partnership will be beneficial for all stakeholders. This partnership will combine solid technical expertise of European Lithium and its affiliates with the industrialknowledge of Obeikan and the strength of Saudi Arabian financial markets. It is a strategic global collaboration to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 and to advance the development of the new industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia .\nAbout European Lithium\nEuropean Lithium Limited is an exploration and development stage mining company focused mainly on lithium in Austria , Ukraine , Ireland , and Australia .
