  "text": "On 7 June, OMEX Alimentaria, a Mexican food company involved in cold meats and dairy products, celebrated World Food Safety Day for the second consecutive year. This year, two production plants and eight distribution centres in the country participated, with more than 1 000 employees.\nThe event became a day of learning and fun, focused on the importance of maintaining high food safety standards throughout the production, distribution and sales chain. During the celebration, fun and educational activities were held, such as knowledge rallies on Good Manufacturing Practices, prerequisites and the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP). In addition, a drawing and video contest was held, aimed at employees' children, to promote awareness about food safety in a creative and participatory way. At the same time, training focused on hygiene practices and proper food handling was provided.\nA highlight was the installation of a banner where employees showed how they contribute to food safety in their work areas. To conclude the day, OMEX Alimentaria offered a tasting session, allowing participants to enjoy the products that the company produces and sells.\nThe General Management actively led these initiatives, involving the entire organization and thus consolidating a comprehensive commitment to food safety. This collective approach reinforces the organizational culture, ensuring the quality and safety of products for consumers.\nRead more World Food Safety Day events this year",
