  "text": "Lynchburg GOP sues to overturn Virginia’s ‘Convention Ban Law’\nFederal lawsuit argues state-run primaries violate First Amendment rights; follows similar legal action planned by 6th District Republicans.\nLYNCHBURG, Va. (VIRGINIA MERCURY) - The Lynchburg Republican City Committee (LRCC) on Tuesday filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Elections, the State Board of Elections and Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, arguing that a 2021 law known as the “Convention Ban Law” unconstitutionally strips political parties of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, comes on the heels of another pending legal challenge from within Virginia’s Republican Party. On March 1, the Republican Committee of Virginia’s 6th Congressional District voted 22-1 to pursue its own litigation against the same statute, claiming it deprives political parties of their ability to control how they nominate candidates.\nAt the heart of both challenges is a new section in the state code, which prohibits parties from using nomination methods that exclude voters “who are otherwise eligible to participate … but are unable to attend meetings” due to certain circumstances including having a disability, temporarily living outside the state, or experiencing a contagious disease.\nThe provision effectively bans long-standing party-run processes such as conventions, mass meetings, and firehouse primaries — instead mandating open, state-run primaries that do not require voter registration by political party.\n“The Convention Ban Law is a direct affront to our freedom of association as a party,” said LRCC Chair Veronica Bratton.\n“Until 2024, the LRCC could choose a party-run process such as a party canvass or a convention to choose its nominee. This allowed us to keep opponents of our party from participating in helping choose our candidate, or even being that candidate.”\nWith the new law taking effect, the commonwealth of Virginia requires Lynchburg Republicans “to allow Democrats, or even people who ran against our nominees, to choose our nominees, or even be our nominees,” Bratton said.\nRead more on virginiamercury.com\nCopyright 2025 WWBT.
