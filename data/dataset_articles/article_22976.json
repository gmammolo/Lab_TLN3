  "text": "Finnish energy company Helen has picked Sweco as engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) partner to build Helsinki’s first green hydrogen plant, called the 3H2 Helsinki Hydrogen Hub.\nHelen aims to supply the clean fuel to the country’s heavy-duty transport sector, with production scheduled to start in 2026.\nThe hub will have a\nhydrogen filling station for vehicles, while Helen will also ship containerised hydrogen to customers.\nHelen aims to start producing hydrogen in 2026, and to open the filling station in 2027.\nSweco\nsaid the pilot plant will produce around three megawatts worth of energy a year.\nExcess heat from production will be used in Helen’s district heating network in the nearby Vuosaari Harbour district, which will increase the plant’s energy efficiency to over 90%.\nHelen says the project will prevent 3,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions entering the atmosphere a year by replacing fossil road fuels and using waste heat.\nPennies for the environment\nThe Finnish government granted the project €8.25m from its fund for large-scale, new-energy demonstration projects.\nHelen will also use €292,500 from its customer-supplied “Environmental Penny fund” to buy shipping containers for the fuel.\nIn the Penny fund scheme, customers pay an extra\n€1.71 a month, which Helen matches to invest in more green energy production capacity.\nEU hydrogen champion\nThe Finnish government wants at least 10% of all green hydrogen used in the EU to come from Finland by 2030.\nThe country aims to be carbon neutral by 2035.\nSweco will plan the plant’s regional infrastructure, including architectural, structural engineering and plant design.\nIt will also provide project management, procurement and site management.\nThe plant’s electrolyser and related equipment are designed, supplied, and installed by a different partner.\n“The 3H2 project is the first of its kind in the world and combines four different sectors: electricity, transport, heating and hydrogen, and the flexibility between them,” said Helen vice president Sari Mannonen.\nSign upto our free email newsletter to get construction stories from around the world sent to your inbox three times a week.",
