  "text": "Annual summer campaign ‘Saving Our Blue’ launched to raise awareness about single use plastics Friday, 5 July 2024, 15:17 Last update: about 1 hour ago Environment Minister Miriam Dalli launched the annual summer campaign called 'Saving Our Blue'. The popular campaign, which has entered its sixth year, seeks to raise awareness about the detrimental effects of littering. It promotes waste reduction and advocates using sustainable, reusable alternatives over single-use plastics. EkoSkola students and media members were invited to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre at Xrobb l-Għaġin, where marine animals are often taken into care after having been rescued for ingesting marine litter. \"We are making significant strides in the implementation of a proper waste management plan, and we are also seeing its results. Of course, such results would not have been possible without the participation of each and every one of us. Although focusing primarily on protecting our seas, this campaign continues to educate the public against littering and promote sustainable choices,\" Minister Miriam Dalli said. President of Nature Trust Malta Vince Attard explained that \"these initiatives are integral to each other; while Saving Our Blue focuses on raising awareness about the critical issue of marine pollution and the dangers of irresponsible waste disposal, the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre provides essential care for injured wildlife, including sea turtles harmed by plastic and other debris\". This year's campaign will also see the introduction of a mobile unit, supporting the awareness-raising element of the campaign. The mobile unit, unveiled today, will allow visitors to make use of the VR glasses. During the day's activities, participants also explored the scenic beauty of Xrobb l-Għaġin, which has recently been designated as a Special Area of Conservation. Students were greeted by the campaign's mascot, Maggie the sea turtle. The mascot was named in honour of a turtle rescued in 2019 by fishermen who found her trapped in sea debris. The turtle had lost a front flipper and parts of her back flippers. The general public is also invited to take part in the initiatives organised by the Saving Our Blue team within the Ministry. Interested participants are encouraged to contact the team through the Saving Our Blue pages on Facebook and Instagram. Further information on initiatives can be found at www.savingourblue.gov.mt.",
