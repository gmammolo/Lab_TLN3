  "text": "The event runs from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and is free with garden admission at 1418 Descanso Drive. The Descanso Railroad, located just past the entrance, features model trains traversing intricate landscapes and depots constructed from natural materials, including flora sourced directly from the gardens. Jennifer Errico, director of communications at Descanso Gardens, explained the inspiration behind the project. “The Ride-on train has always been a really popular amenity here at the Gardens,” he said. “About two years ago we saw some trains in another garden. It’s a company called Applied Imagination, and they build train stations and train areas from natural materials.” The new attraction incorporates elements of Descanso’s natural surroundings, including wood from oak trees felled during last year’s storms, seamlessly integrating the railroad into the garden’s ecosystem. Visitors can embark on journeys aboard an electric train from a newly constructed station, adding an interactive dimension to their garden exploration experience. The railroad’s design features tracks at varying heights, allowing trains to run both above visitors and at ground level for children to enjoy. “These train stations are built from natural materials, so if you look at them, you’ll see acorns in the chimneys and mahogany seed pods and all different barks,” Errico said. The initial exhibition will showcase famous train stations from across the United States, with plans to rotate themes every six months. Some of these intricate stations take thousands of hours to build. To enhance the grand opening festivities, the musical group True Blue will perform live bluegrass in the Oak Grove from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Descanso Railroad is part of a broader master plan approved in 2020, which involved significant community input and support. Errico noted the overwhelming positive response saying he has not heard one negative thing about construction. “In fact, we have a really large, wonderful group of volunteers here that help us in the hundreds,” he said. Looking ahead, Descanso Gardens has plans for further expansion, including a lake rehabilitation project and the construction of a children’s garden, with construction beginning by year-end and expected to open in two years. Errico said these future developments will feature educational elements focused on water, a sensory garden, and other nature-themed attractions, further enhancing the garden’s offerings for visitors of all ages. Train ride tickets will be available for purchase during the grand opening, though availability is limited. Members of Descanso Gardens will have early access to the attraction from July 5 to 12.
