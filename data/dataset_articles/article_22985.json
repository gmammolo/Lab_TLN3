  "text": "Shoreliners enjoyed glorious warm weather on leg four of the Win Walking In Nature Shoreline Challenge from Ramsgate to Southbroom recently.\nStrollers were treated to the striking natural beauty of coastal flora and fauna, and with the sardines still around, the seabirds put on a delightful show.\nFor those carrying a bag to collect rubbish along the way, little litter was found on this particular 5.4km coastal stretch.\nZonel Louw (left) and Lize du Breez from Leisure Bay. Those taking part in this year’s challenge have now reached the halfway point.\nMzimkhulu Honorary Officer Maxine Willemse reported that 102 walkers and six fur-walkers took part.\nThe Shoreline Challenge is an annual event organised by the Mzimkhulu Honorary Officers.\nThe challenge is broken down into eight different walks of between five to seven kilometres held on a Sunday over the course of four months, from May to August.\nIt was a family outing (from left) Jacey Bekker, Denise van Wyk and her daughter, Alicia with Andre Bekker. The next walk of 6.95km is from Southbroom Beach to Mpenjati on Sunday, July 7.\nFor bookings, questions, or food orders, contact Maxine on 071 5176408.\nEveryone is welcome.\nHAVE YOUR SAY\nLike the South Coast Herald’s Facebook page, follow us on Twitter and Instagram",
