  "text": "During Friday's inauguration ceremony, broadcast by his office, he emphasized the importance of water as a vital resource for daily life and agricultural success. Jokowi noted that agricultural production, including rice, has declined globally, potentially leading to famine for 500 million people. \"Water has become an essential commodity,\" he pointed out. The dam, whose construction began in 2017, was completed in nearly seven years. Built at a cost of Rp1.6 trillion (US$95 million), it has a capacity of 82 million cubic meters and an area of inundation reaching 460 hectares. \"This is a large and expensive dam,\" he said. Jokowi explained that rainwater collected through the dam will provide local people with irrigation water, electricity, and flood control. \"The primary function is irrigation, supplying water for rice fields in Takalar and surrounding areas,\" he added. To further boost agricultural productivity in South Sulawesi, the government has distributed 80 water pumps to Bantaeng district, part of a national program aiming to distribute 20,000 pumps. These pumps are expected to support rice field irrigation and agricultural activities, mitigating the drought predicted for July to October.
