  "text": "ISLAMABAD: The Senate was informed that the federal government is encouraging the use of electric vehicles in order to protect the environment and reduce dependence on imported fuel.\nMinister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar told the House during Question Hour that thirty electric buses have been imported from China. These buses have been stationed at Jinnah Convention Center in Islamabad where state of the art charging facilities have been made available. He said the soft launch of these buses is taking place today.\nThe Minister for Law told the House that NADRA centers will be established in each Union Council in the next two and a half years.\nHe said the NADRA has prepared a comprehensive phased wise plan in this regard and 1150 Union Councils will have NADRA centers in ten months.\nMinister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar told the House that the government has not ceased the advertisement of any television channel.\nHe said the advertisements are being given in accordance with their ratings. He said newspapers received advertisements worth nine billion rupees, and television channels of six billion rupees over the last five years.\nThe Minister for Information also clarified that no new tax has been imposed on newspapers in the budget 2024-25.\nHe emphasized the need for making advertisement policy more effective after consultations with the stakeholders.\nTaking the floor, Leader of the House Ishaq Dar assured that the privatization process will be taken forward in a transparent manner and due process will be followed. He however emphasized there should not be any politics on this matter.\nThe Leader of the House proposed formation of a special committee to ascertain why the privatization of Pakistan Steel Mills did not occur, which resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of rupees.\nThe Senate also passed The State Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) Amendment Bill, 2024.\nIt was moved by Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar.\nThe Law Minister said the bill is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the Boards of Directors of State-Owned Enterprises.",
