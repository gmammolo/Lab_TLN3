  "text": "BROOKLYN, N.Y. — A Brooklyn man has been arraigned on a manslaughter indictment after allegedly speeding through a stop sign and crashing into a school bus, killing his 26-year-old passenger and injuring the driver before attempting to flee the scene in an Uber.\nKey Points\n- Tyree Epps, 32, indicted on manslaughter and multiple related charges\n- Crash killed passenger Imani Vance and injured school bus driver\n- Defendant allegedly fled in an Uber before being caught by\npolice\nBrooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez announced that Tyree Epps, 32, was arraigned before Supreme Court Justice Dineen Riviezzo on charges including second-degree manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, assault, and leaving the scene of an incident. Epps was ordered held without bail and is due back in court on June 20.\nThe crash occurred around 1:15 p.m. on February 27, when Epps allegedly ran a stop sign at a high rate of speed while driving a 2008 Mercedes-Benz C300 southbound on Van Sinderen Avenue. He then struck a school bus traveling on Blake Avenue in East\nNew York, causing his passenger, Imani Vance, to be thrown into the windshield.\nPassenger killed, driver injured\nVance, 26, was rushed to Brookdale\nHospital, where she was pronounced dead from blunt impact injuries, including a fatal heart laceration. The school bus, which had no passengers on board, collided with a third unoccupied vehicle. The 57-year-old female bus driver suffered minor injuries. Related News: Migrant child assault offender arrested by ICE after Fairfax County refused to honor detainer\nProsecutors said the defendant showed “a shocking disregard for human life and safety” by allegedly fleeing the crash site instead of helping the victim.\nAttempted getaway ends in arrest\nAfter the collision, Epps allegedly fled on foot and jumped into an Uber, instructing the driver to leave the scene. Police were able to track the vehicle and stopped it, prompting Epps to flee again on foot before being apprehended by NYPD officers.\nCharges against Epps also include disobeying stop signs, speeding, and operating a vehicle without a\nlicense.\nTyree Epps is being held without bail following a fatal crash that prosecutors say was marked by reckless driving and an attempted escape.",
