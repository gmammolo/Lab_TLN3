  "text": "Nearly three years ago, MrBeast and TeamSeas started an initiative to raise $30 million to remove 30 million pounds of ocean trash. A few days ago, they announced that they had surpassed their goal, having pulled 34 million pounds of trash from the sea. It's a stunning achievement that shows the best side of content creation and pulling together online communities for the greater good. With over 300 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, MrBeast has a lot of sway, which is evident in the results. The fundraiser started in 2021, with people encouraged to donate $1 to clean up one pound of trash. But people did much more than that. Not only did they donate, but they also got out, formed teams, and started cleaning local beaches and waterways. And, thanks to MrBeast's online popularity, other content creators got involved, with over 400,000 contributing videos related to the cause. All the effort paid off, and according to TeamSeas, a third-party source verified the outcome. This isn't MrBeast's first foray into philanthropy. The American YouTuber, who began posting videos when he was just 13, also runs the Beast Philanthropy channel , where he's done everything from helping those with sight issues receive surgery to adopting an orphanage. He's also worked on environmental issues before. In October 2019, he teamed up with fellow YouTuber Mark Rober for TeamTrees and vowed to raise $20 million by January 1 to plant 20 million trees. That goal was surpassed before the self-imposed limit and, as of last month, over 24 million trees have been planted. While some are critical of MrBeast's over-the-top videos and the motivations for his fundraising, there's no doubt that he's making an impact on the planet, one click at a time. And while the original TeamSeas goal is over, people are being encouraged to donate and support Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup to keep the movement going. International collaborative fundraising campaign TeamSeas has surpassed its original goal and cleaned up 34 million pounds of trash from the ocean. The initiative was started in 2021 by popular American YouTuber MrBeast. View this post on Instagram Over 400,00 content creators made videos to support the fundraiser, which asked for $1 to clean up one pound of trash. Ordinary people formed teams and competed to see who could do the best cleanup. The success of TeamSeas proves that online communities can come together for the greater good. As of today all 34,000,000 pounds of trash from TeamSeas has been removed from the ocean and verified by a third party 😀 — MrBeast (@MrBeast) [July 16, 2024] Related Articles: Japan Has a Competitive Sport for Trash Collecting Called ‘SpoGomi’ Man Spends Over 1,000 Days Straight Cleaning Up Trash in His Local Parks Man Cleans Up Beaches With Custom-Built Grabber and Remote-Controlled Trash Can People Are Picking Up Trash and Sharing Before-and-After Photos for the “Trashtag Challenge”",
