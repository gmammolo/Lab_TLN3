  "text": "Beaches in Monterey County scored high in water quality during the summer, according to this year’s edition of Heal the Bay’s 34th annual “ Beach Report Card ,” which was released on Wednesday. Heal the Bay , a Santa Monica-based environment nonprofit, releases the annual report that examines the amount of pollution at beaches along the West Coast to help keep people safe when visiting the beach. The “Beach Report Card” utilizes an A-to-F grading system to communicate water quality to the public. While A or B grades indicate good water quality for recreational use, C to F grades mean increased health risks, according to the report. The grades are split into three seasonal categories, including summer dry, wet weather and winter dry. “I’m excited to announce that once again, during the summer when most people are in the water, 90% of our West Coast beaches were safe to swim in 2023,” said Heal the Bay President and CEO Tracy Quinn at a press conference on Wednesday. This year’s report graded more than 500 beaches in California. Monterey County’s beaches received all A’s for Summer Dry grades, which is better than average according to the report. Wet Weather Grades were also above average with county beaches getting A and B grades. Heal the Bay’s scores saw a drop during the winter dry and wet weather periods coastal counties, because California received 31% more rainfall than the 10-year average during the winter. The report said Monterey County does not monitor its beaches in winter months so no Winter Dry Grades were generated. “L.A. County received 23 inches of rain, and while we celebrate rain here in Southern California, our highly developed landscape turned rain into polluted urban runoff,” said Annelisa Moe, associate director of science and policy and water quality at Heal the Bay. “This unfortunately led to particularly poor grades this year during our winter season.” Sewage spills and inadequate infrastructure is also an issue for water quality at beaches, Moe said. Monterey County’s 36 spills sent 2,986 gallons of sewage into waterways across the county. Los Angeles County saw 185 sewage spills totaling approximately 9 million gallons, a stark increase from the 330,396 gallons reported the previous year, according to the report. In February, about 8 million gallons of raw waste entered the Dominguez Channel, subsequently affecting Cabrillo Beach and necessitating beach closures . The report is available at healthebay.org .
