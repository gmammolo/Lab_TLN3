  "text": "By Liz Carey ,\n10 hours ago On Tuesday, Hawaiian Electric announced it had begun deploying high-resolution video cameras equipped with Artificial Intelligence technology for early detection of wildfires.\nThe technology will provide enhanced situational awareness, the company said, and help in detecting ignitions in elevated fire risk areas near company infrastructure more quickly. The first camera station was install in Lahaina, the company said. Future plans include deploying a total of 78 camera stations on the five islands served by the company. Each camera station will have two cameras to provide a full 360-degree view. Camera feeds will be monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week, officials said. The public will also have access to the camera’s live feeds.\n“We are continuing to take action to address the growing risks from wildfires across our service territory using a variety of technologies and methods,” Jim Alberts, Hawaiian Electric senior vice president and chief operations officer, said. “Installing publicly viewable AI-assisted video cameras in elevated fire risk areas will enable the company, fire agencies, and emergency operations centers the ability to identify potential wildfires early and respond quickly.”\nThe $14 million project is part of Hawaiian Electric’s efforts to reduce the risk of wildfires, officials said. It’s five-year contract with California-based ALERTWest includes installation and maintenance of the camera stations, as well as around-the-clock monitoring by experience wildfire safety professionals. Approximately 50 percent of the project’s costs will be covered by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funding. An estimate $90 million grant covering costs related to Hawaiian Electric’s resiliency and wildfire mitigation work will be used for the camera stations.\nThe post Hawaiian Electric deploys AI video cameras to detect wildfires appeared first on Daily Energy Insider .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
