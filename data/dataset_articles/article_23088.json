Grades up to 99.4g/t Au Recorded\nFlynn Gold Limited (ASX: FG1, “Flynn” or “the Company”)is pleased to announce the discovery of an extensive system of gold bearing quartz veins within historical workings located approximately 250m north of the historic Trafalgar Mine at its 100% owned Golden Ridge Project in Northeast Tasmania (see Figure 1).\nHighlights\n- New high-grade gold vein zone discovered in trenching 250m north of the Trafalgar mine at the Golden Ridge Project, NE Tasmania where Flynn is currently drilling\n- 17 out of 36 grab rock chip samples assayed over 10g/t Au, including 99.4g/t Au, 76.6g/t Au and 67.1g/t Au\n- Gold hosted in multiple sub-parallel quartz-sulphide veins over a minimum 65m wide zone\n- Assays from initial trench channel sampling include high-grade mineralised intervals:\n- 11.0m @ 2.0g/t Au including 3.3m @ 6.3g/t Au, and\n- 16.5m @ 1.3g/t Au including 1.5m @ 6.8g/t Au and 4.0m @\n- 2.4g/t Au\n- The new vein zone discovery significantly expands the gold mineralised footprint at the Trafalgar prospect\n- Diamond drilling is underway to test gold mineralisation at depth below the trenching.\n- For further information or to post questions go to the Flynn Gold Investor Hub at\nhttps://investorhub.flynngold.com.au/link/DP47lr\nManaging Director & CEO Neil Marston, commenting on the results said:\n“The company is excited by the discovery of multiple high-grade gold veins approximately 250m north of the main Trafalgar gold deposit at Golden Ridge in Northeast Tasmania. These gold veins were exposed in trenching over an area of historical mine workings which appear unrecorded since they were dug about a century ago.\n“The vein system potentially expands the footprint of gold mineralisation at Trafalgar to a 500m wide corridor which remains open in all directions, once again confirming the potential for significant scale at the Golden Ridge Project.”\n“With so many high-grade gold assays recorded at the surface we have adjusted our on- going diamond drilling program to test beneath these old workings and we look forward to reporting the results of this drilling shortly.”\nFigure 1 - Location of Flynn Gold tenements in NE Tasmania.\nField Mapping and Trenching Program\nFollowing up on recent gold-in-soil anomalies\n[1](file:///C:/Users/Cez/Downloads/fg1.docx#_bookmark0) Flynn geologists have discovered an area of previously unmapped historical prospecting trenches, pits and adits which are believed to have been excavated as late as the 1930’s. The main feature of the historical workings is a 240m long North-South trench which was possibly part of a historic water race that exposed the gold bearing veins during its construction. Flynn recently re-excavated part of this historical trench and has added new trenching nearby (Figure 3).\nAs a result of the trenching work, Flynn has mapped and sampled 19 in-situ quartz- sulphide veins over a width of 65m to date, with initial grab samples collected recording gold grades up to 76.6g/t Au from in-situ outcropping veins (Figure 3).\nClick here for the full ASX Release This article includes content from Flynn Gold, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

The region has established mining districts, excellent infrastructure such as rail and ports, and a skilled workforce, with a stable political and regulatory environment. These features are a big positive for the company’s projects in this region.\nThe company has nine 100 percent owned tenements in Northeast Tasmania which are highly prospective for gold and tin/tungsten with three major projects — Golden Ridge, Portland and Warrentinna. In Northwest Tasmania, it has the Henty zinc-lead-silver and the Firetower gold and critical minerals projects.\nFlynn Gold’s exploration at its Golden Ridge Project has focused on an 8-kilometre-long granodiorite-metasediment contact zone with diamond drilling programs completed at the Brilliant and Trafalgar prospects, with multiple high-grade gold vein intersections.\nMoreover, the company’s first diamond drilling programs at its Warrentinna and Firetower projects have been completed with assays pending.\nApart from Tasmania, the company is building a strategic lithium and gold portfolio in Western Australia, targeting hard-rock lithium pegmatites and intrusive related gold deposits in the Pilbara region and Yilgarn Craton. Its five lithium-gold projects in Western Australia are strategically located in districts hosting large gold and lithium deposits or in regions that are relatively under-explored for lithium. Of these, three lithium-gold projects are in the Yilgarn region: Forrestania, Lake Johnston and Koolyanobbing. The remaining two lithium-gold projects are in the Pilbara region: Mt Dove and Yarrie.\nFlynn’s recent acquisitions have been focused on strengthening its lithium portfolio. This includes the option agreement to purchase two exploration licences at the Parker Dome Project in Western Australia, which is considered highly prospective for lithium. In addition to this, Flynn has also increased its land position closer to the Mt Holland lithium project. Four new exploration licence applications covering approximately 20 sq. km. have been lodged with the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety.\nThe focus on lithium positions the company to benefit from the global transition towards clean energy. The recent COP28 summit in Dubai signaled the world's desire to move away from fossil fuels over the next few decades to address climate change. Electric vehicles are likely to remain in focus as a key solution to the climate challenges. Most of the lithium is used to make\nlithium-ion batteries for electric cars and mobile devices. Summarily, lithium will be in high demand given this trend.\nCompany Highlights\n- Flynn Gold is an Australian mineral exploration company with a portfolio of gold and battery metals projects in Tasmania and Western Australia.\n- In Tasmania, the company holds 12 tenements spread across 1,475 sq. km., including three main projects in Northeast Tasmania — Golden Ridge, Warrentinna and Portland — that are prospective for gold and tin. Moreover, it has two projects in Northwest Tasmania: the Henty zinc-lead-silver project and the Firetower gold-cobalt-tungsten-copper project.\n- In Western Australia, Flynn holds 24 tenements across 1,140 sq. km., including lithium-gold projects in the Pilbara and Yilgarn regions. The Yilgarn region has three lithium-gold projects: Forrestania; Lake Johnston and Koolyanobbing. The Pilbara hosts two gold-lithium projects: Mt Dove and Yarrie.\n- In addition to these focus areas, the company holds an option to acquire two exploration licences at Parker Dome in Western Australia, situated near the world-class Mount Holland lithium project.\n- The company’s near-term focus is on its Northeast Tasmania gold portfolio due to its geological similarity to the Victorian goldfields.\n- Flynn Gold’s exploration at its flagship Golden Ridge Project in NE Tasmania has focused on an 8-kilometre-long granodiorite-metasediment contact zone with diamond drilling to date intersecting multiple high-grade gold vein intervals.\n- In November 2023, the company announced strong metallurgical test results from the Golden Ridge project, as exploration commenced at two other Tasmanian projects — Warrentinna and Firetower – with results pending.\n- In December 2023, the company announced plans to raise $2.4 million that will help advance its exploration activities including the acquisition of the exploration licences at Parker Dome.\n- The company’s senior leadership team has a proven track record in the mining sector to capitalize on the high resource potential of its projects.\nKey Projects\nNortheast Tasmania\nThe company has three main projects in northeast Tasmania — Golden Ridge, Portland and Warrentinna. The under-explored Northeast Tasmania region is interpreted to be part of the Western Lachlan Orogen, a geological extension of the rich Victorian Goldfields which boast of historical gold production of over 80 million ounces (Moz). The company’s landholding across nine 100 percent owned tenements in the region has provided it with significant potential for gold and tin discoveries.\nGolden Ridge Project\nTargeted for intrusive related gold system (IRGS) style mineralization, the Golden Ridge project is located 75 kilometres east of Launceston in Northeast Tasmania. Previous gold exploration at the Golden Ridge Project has been very limited with shallow historical workings located over an 8-kilometre-long granodiorite-metasediment contact zone. Flynn Gold’s exploration has focused on the Brilliant and Trafalgar prospects, with diamond drilling programs completed at both locations between June 2021 and August 2023. In addition, a limited reconnaissance RC drilling program in late 2022 to test for gold mineralisation at the Link Zone confirmed the presence of shallow gold mineralisation between the Brilliant and Trafalgar prospects, highlighting the significant gold potential of the granodiorite-metasediment contact zone.\nDrilling at Trafalgar consisted of 14 holes for 5,218.3 metres with multiple vein intersections grading >100 grams per ton (g/t) gold reported. The best intersections recorded in drilling at Trafalgar were 16.8 g/t gold over 12.3 metres (from 108.7 to 121 metres), including 0.7m at 152.5 g/t gold and 23.7 g/t gold over 4 metres (from 23 to 27 metres), including a high-grade zone of 0.5 metre at 169.8 g/t gold.\nDrilling completed at Trafalgar intersected high-grade gold over a strike length of 400 metres and from depths of 40 to 400 metres below surface, confirming a significant new gold discovery that is open in all directions.\nInitial metallurgical tests were successfully completed in November 2023 on 26 drill samples from the Trafalgar prospect. Average gold recovery of 94.5 percent was recorded using conventional bottle roll leaching.\nPortland Project\nThe Portland gold project covers 370 sq. kms. and comprises three adjacent tenements: Portland, Telegraph and Cameron Tin. The project falls within the region mined historically from 1870 to 1917 and has similarities to Victorian geology with high-grade “Fosterville-style” gold mineralization confirmed. Geochemical surveys and costean sampling programs at Portland confirmed the presence of anomalous gold zones. Drilling at the Grand Flaneur prospect in 2022 and the Popes prospect in 2023 have both confirmed the presence of gold mineralization.\nWarrentinna Project\nThe Warrentinna project was acquired in 2023 from Greatland Gold plc (LSE:\nGGP). The Project is located in northeast Tasmania and covers an area of approximately 37 sq km immediately adjacent to Flynn’s existing Lyndhurst Project. The tenement encompasses two historic goldfields, Forester and Warrentinna. Both fields produced high-grade gold deposits in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Warrentinna goldfield is defined by numerous historic workings and largely untested prospects over a strike length of 6 kilometres.\nInitial drilling by Flynn in September/October 2023 at Warrentinna consisted of two diamond drill holes, designed to test the continuity and extension of orogenic style gold mineralisation identified in historical drilling. The holes are also designed to provide stratigraphic and structural information critical to advancing understanding of the project. Assay results are pending.\nNorthwest Tasmania\nThe company has two projects in the Northwest Tasmania region: the Henty zinc project and the Firetower project.\nHenty Zinc Project\nThe project is a 130 sq. km land holding under two 100 percent owned exploration licences and provides the company with a dominant position in a rich base metals field with proximity to an existing zinc/lead concentrate producer (MMG’s Rosebery mine).\nThe Henty Project has a significant pipeline of exploration targets with the Mariposa and Grieves Siding prospects ready for resource drilling\nFiretower Project\nThe project was acquired in 2023 from Greatland Gold plc (LSE: GGP). The project spans more than 62 sq. kms. and represents an advanced gold plus battery metals project, which includes three notable prospects: Firetower, Firetower East and Firetower West. The Firetower project lies in the highly mineralized Mt Read volcanic sequence which hosts major polymetallic base metals and gold deposits such as Hellyer and Rosebery, copper-gold deposits such as Mt Lyell (3 million tons contained copper, 3.1 Moz contained gold), and the Henty gold mine (1.64 Moz gold @ 12.5 g/t gold).\nResampling of the historic core at Firetower has confirmed the significant potential for gold and critical minerals - cobalt, tungsten and copper. The results have made it clear this project represents an exciting polymetallic opportunity. The company commenced a diamond drilling program in October 2023 to target both the gold and polymetallic minerals potential.\nWestern Australia\nFlynn holds five gold-lithium projects in the resources-rich state of Western Australia, strategically located near large gold and lithium deposits or in regions that are relatively under-explored for lithium.\nThe five projects include: Mt. Dove and Yarrie in Pilbara; and Koolyanobbing, Forrestania and Lake Johnston in Yilgarn.\nMt Dove Project\nLocated 70 kilometres south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara region, Mt Dove comprises five granted licences covering 86.6 sq. kms. and one tenement application. The project is located near the large Hemi gold deposit (De Grey Mining, ASX:\nDEG) and the large lithium mines at Pilgangoora and Wodgina. The company has completed two soil sampling programs at Mt Dove, which have identified lithium and gold anomalies. The follow-up exploration, which is likely to include aircore drilling, intends to test lithium and gold anomalies identified during the soil sampling program completed in 2022 and 2023.\nYarrie Project\nThe Yarrie Project comprises three tenements and one application covering 424 sq. kms. Very limited historical exploration has been undertaken for lithium, gold and copper on the project. The project is highly prospective for iron ore, being close to historic mining operations and existing rail infrastructure.\nForrestania Project\nThe Forrestania project consists of one exploration licence and five exploration licence applications over a 320 sq. km. area. It is located near the Mt Holland lithium deposit (Wesfarmers (ASX:\nWES)/ SQM (NYSE: https://investingnews.com/stocks/nyse-sqm/sociedad-quimica-y-minera-s-a-sqm/) JV) and high-grade nickel deposits, Flying Fox and Maggie Hays.\nLake Johnston Project\nLake Johnston consists of five exploration licenses over a 116 sq. km. area, and is located near the Burmeister lithium discovery (TG Metals (ASX:\nTG6)) and the Medcalf, Lake Percy and Mt Day Lithium projects.\nKoolyanobbing Project\nKoolyanobbing comprises one exploration licence and two applications targeting gold and lithium mineralization over an 82 sq. km. area in the Marda-Diemals greenstone belt.\nParker Dome Project\nIn addition to the above-mentioned projects, Flynn has secured an option agreement to purchase two exploration licences at the Parker Dome project in Western Australia, which is considered highly prospective for lithium. The Parker Dome project covers 42 sq. kms. and is situated 50 kilometres north of the world-class Mount Holland lithium project in Western Australia. The licences are fully permitted allowing for an immediate commencement of exploration and drilling. The company expects to commence drilling at Parker Dome in early 2024.\nManagement Team\nClive Duncan – Non-executive Chair\nClive Duncan has over four decades of experience at big box hardware chain Bunnings, including as chief operating officer and company director.

Based on the new model this first drill hole was designed to test for mineralisation beneath the historic Trafalgar mine, and up dip of previously intersected high-grade intervals. We have intersected high-grade mineralisation in the target zones, which increases confidence in our work and the ability to understand this high-grade gold system.”\n“We look forward to releasing further drilling results as this program progresses over the coming weeks.”\nFigure 1 - Location of Flynn Gold tenements in NE Tasmania.\nTrafalgar Prospect - Phase 3 Drilling\nPhase 3 drilling commenced at the Trafalgar prospect in mid-April 2024. The planned 1,500m diamond drill program will initially comprise infill and extension drilling targeting down-dip and along-strike extensions to previously drilled high-grade gold intercepts. Initial holes are designed as infill and close-spaced step-outs around the previous wide-spaced drilling (100m average drill hole spacing) and will be used to test and refine the current vein model and inform targeting of further step-out strike and depth extension drilling.\nThe first hole, TFDD016, was drilled to 355.9m and was designed to in-fill widely-spaced drilling and test all 3 of the main veins (Trafalgar Main, Magazine, and Trafalgar South veins) and associated splays identified in Flynn’s recent modelled interpretation of the deposit\nAssay results have been received for TFDD016 from 18.0m to 274.0m depth with the remaining samples (274.0-355.9m) at the laboratory.\nTFDD016 was drilled into granodiorite, drilling towards the south under historical workings. As predicted, multiple zones with visible signs of mineralisation, including visible gold, were intersected in the hole. Significant intercepts are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 with full drilling details shown in Tables 1 & 2.\nFigure 2 - Trafalgar Prospect collar location plan with interpreted mineralised veins projected to [surface].\nThe second hole, TFDD017, was completed last week with a final depth of 248.4m. It was also designed to test all the main veins (Trafalgar Main, Magazine, and Trafalgar South veins) (see Figure 2). This hole is currently being logged and sampled.\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02811183-3A643221 This article includes content from Flynn Gold, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

The drill program is designed to in-fill test the high-grade gold zones discovered from earlier programs and test extensions to the known mineralisation.\n- Flynn’s exploration is targeting a gold mineralised granodiorite- metasediment contact which has grown to over 9km in length\n- For further information or to post questions go to the Flynn Gold Investor Hub at\nhttps://investorhub.flynngold.com.au/link/4r8dWr\nThe Link Zone is located between the Trafalgar and Brilliant prospects along the Golden Ridge granodiorite contact. Previous diamond drilling at Trafalgar and Brilliant has returned outstanding results with multiple intersections over 100g/t Au recorded at the Trafalgar prospect, which is currently being followed up with an active diamond drillhole campaign1.\nManaging Director & CEO, Neil Marston commenting on the results said:\n“Our confidence in Golden Ridge as an extensive, high grade intrusive-related gold system continues to grow with these Link Zone results confirming that high grade mineralisation exists within an increasingly well-defined corridor that has the potential to link the Brilliant and Trafalgar prospects over a strike length of 2.5km. Whilst drilling is ongoing at Trafalgar our exploration team is actively exploring to further extend the gold system at Golden Ridge which we expect will lead to identifying additional drilling targets similar to the Link Zone.”\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02808812-3A642797 This article includes content from Flynn Gold, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

Several historic drill holes reportedly ended in mineralisation.\n“These early results demonstrate the continuity of polymetallic mineralisation and highlight the significant potential for high-grade mineralisation to continue at depth and along strike.”\nFiretower Drilling\nThe Company completed 496m of diamond drilling at the Firetower prospect in December 2023 with extension tails to three historical diamond holes and one new hole drilled. The drilling followed a due diligence period of historical data validation and review, drill core resampling, drill program planning, environmental surveys, community and stakeholder liaison, access clearance and statutory work program permitting carried out by the Company.\nThe short drill program was designed to test for depth/strike extensions to historically drilled polymetallic (Au-Co-W-Cu) mineralisation, and to provide stratigraphic and structural information to assist geological evaluation of controls to high-grade mineralisation. All assay results have now been received from the drilling. See Figures 1 & 2 and Appendix 1 for details of the latest drilling.\nAs previously reported1, extension drill hole 2019FTD007E was drilled for 83.2m from 98.7m – 181.9m to test for the continuation of gold-cobalt-tungsten-copper mineralisation at depth and along strike from hole 2019FTD006 (9.0m @ 2.56g/t Au, 0.25% Co, 0.32% WO3, 0.1% Cu from 99.0m, including 3.0m @ 8.59g/t Au, 0.29% Co, 0.83% WO3, 0.21% Cu from 105m).\nHole 2019FTD007E intersected the thickest down-hole zone of polymetallic mineralisation ever drilled at Firetower, with:\n- 17m @ 2.31g/t Au, 0.16% Co, 0.38% WO3 and 0.16% Cu from 121m; including:\n- 1.7m @ 6.64g/t Au, 0.12% Co, 0.87% WO3 and 0.14% Cu from 121m and\n- 5.5m @ 3.27g/t Au, 0.24% Co, 0.53% WO3 and 0.33% Cu from 132.5m.\nExtension drill hole 2019FTD004E was drilled for 121.1m from 106m – 227.1m. Highlights from this extended hole include (as previously reported):\n- 9.1m @ 0.85g/t Au, 0.1% Co, 0.09% WO3 and 0.15% Cu, from 111.9m, including\n- 2.4m @ 1.7g/t Au, 0.15% Co, 0.26% WO3 and 0.19% Cu from 118.6m.\nExtension drill hole 2019FTD005E was drilled for 76.9m from 120.5m – 197.4m. Best intercept in the hole was:\n- 2.4m @ 1.37g/t Au, 0.15% Co, 0.35% WO3, 0.04% Cu from 141.0m.\nHole FT-2023-001, drilled from surface to a down-hole depth of 214.8m, intercepted a best polymetallic intercept associated with a discrete zone of chalcopyrite-rich sulphide breccia veining of:\n- 0.75m @ 5.33g/t Au, 2.65% Cu, 0.005% Co, 0.05% WO3 from 159.75m.\nFiretower Geological Modelling\nThe results of Flynn’s drilling are highly encouraging and confirm that follow-up exploration is warranted at Firetower. Modelling of updated drill hole structural and stratigraphic data (including 3D modelling) is in progress to evaluate controls to the high-grade polymetallic Au-Co-W-Cu mineralisation at Firetower and optimise targets for potential follow-up drilling.\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02788824-3A639432 This article includes content from Flynn Gold, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

They were extracting flint pebbles, from which they made tools.\nFor thousands of years, mining was a slow, labourious and dangerous activity. Workers dug mine shafts using hand tools. Next, came picks and shovels, which gave way to fire. Piling firewood near the rock face and setting it alight weakened and fractured the rock.\nPanning for gold was popular during 19th century gold rushes. A miner filled a pan with soil or gravel and water. As the miner swirled the pan, the gravel separated and washed away. The gold and heavier minerals stayed behind, in the pan.\nLater miners\nused a rocker. They shoveled gravel onto a perforated iron plate and poured water over it. Small particles fell through the holes where they landed on an apron that dispersed them evenly, perpendicular to the bottom and sides of the cradle. As the material passed through the cradle, gold became trapped.\nPlacer mining uses water to recover heavy minerals from alluvial deposits. Denser gold sinks faster than lighter sand and gravel in places where fast water currents slow down.\nPiston-powered and compressed air drills increased the capability and efficiency of hard rock mining. Electric conveyor belts and the mechanized loading of mine cars and vehicles replaced manual loading and hauling. Steam pumps controlled the water trying to flood shafts. Gas and battery-powered lamps replaced candles and oil-wick lamps.\nTechnological innovations in mineral exploration\nRecognizing the demanding and costly realities of charting measurements using\nportable X-ray fluorescence, near-infrared spectroscopy, cameras and goniometers when scanning geological core samples, Geotek developed BoxScan.\nIt can acquire six different datasets using a single technician without controlling each core or introducing human error in the measurements.\nBoxScan throughput speed is easily tailored for individual projects. That includes measurement frequency, measurement type and measurement time, which permits the automatic acquisition of geotechnical and geochemical parameters.\nAustralian firm\nTempest Minerals (ASX:TEM) is one mineral exploration company that’s leveraging the BoxScan technology. Collected soil samples at the Remorse target on its Yalgoo project were scanned and analysed with BoxScan. These findings helped inform a drilling program that may uncover the site’s potential.\nDrones in mining\nThe fact that drones\ncan measure accurately to 25 millimetres and are significantly less costly to operate makes them ideal for surveying and planning. The modern prospector doesn’t walk and camp for weeks next to a packed mule. Nor is a helicopter required to ferry them in and out of a site.\nSoftware advances allow viewing of how a surface has changed over time when elevation, slope and terrain mapping data are collected and compared with information\ngathered from previous flights.\nAnglo American (LSE:\nAAL,OTCQX:AAUKF) uses drones to track work progress and collect stockpile data, especially in areas that are difficult to reach. Drones assist BHP ( ASX: BHP,NYSE:BHP,LSE:BHP) in collecting information on mining surfaces as well as measuring stockpile volumes. It also uses the technology to monitor buildings, cranes and towers, and prevent workers from being injured while working at heights.\nSpecialized mine drones do not require GPS for navigation, which is a good thing considering GPS is\noften unavailable in mining locations.\nAutomation and autonomous technologies\nRio Tinto’s autonomous trucks receive topographical route\ninformation from drones. Instead of a driver a central controller operates the trucks through a supervisory system.\nFrom the Western Australia Pilbara region to port facilities, an autonomous train network of 200 locomotives covers 1,700 kilometres of track. These trains reduce risks at level crossings and respond to speed restrictions and alarms. They also eliminate the requirement to transport drivers to and from trains mid-journey, saving travel costs.\nFrom remote locations using a single console, a controller plans the activities of drills on multiple Rio Tinto mine sites. Charge trucks automate the process of pumping explosives into drill holes. Computers and data analytics determine the correct explosive type and quantity, which reduces waste and improves blast efficiency.\nAngloGold Ashanti (NYSE:\nAU) runs an autonomous drill fleet at its hard rock Tropicana mine. The fleet contributes to worker safety while increasing productivity.\nBig data in mining\nAs mining automation combines with faster communication speeds, expect rapid growth of mining-related data. Big data platforms collect structured and unstructured data from diverse, unrelated sources.\nWhen examined and interpreted, this data can ensure ideal extraction and flow, and reduce time lost in maintenance and delays.\nResource companies like Tempest Minerals, rely on historical and current exploration data to make informed decisions on drilling targets. Technologies that automate reporting and analysis of these massive amounts of information can provide a competitive advantage for any company that leverages these tools.\nInvestor takeaway\nAdvances in mining technology offer safer, accurate, cost-effective and more sustainable methods of finding and extracting materials from the earth. Resource companies that effectively employ these systems present a compelling investment opportunity, demonstrating a strategic approach to creating shareholder value.\nDave Chapelle is a freelance writer based in Ontario.\nThis INNSpired article is sponsored by\nTempest Minerals (ASX:TEM).

Nevada currently hosts the\nonly producing lithium mine in North America, and is home to Thacker Pass, the largest known lithium deposit in the US. GMV now controls or owns 165 lode claims covering 3,408 acres at Daisy Creek. The claims are close to operating gold mines and have access to existing power lines, water and paved highways. Following a high-resolution radiometric and magnetic helicopter survey in October 2023 and a field sampling program in December 2023, GMV is now drill-permitted to test the Nevada property.\nCompany Highlights\n- GMV Minerals is a junior gold development company focusing mainly on its gold asset Arizona and recently acquired lithium option in Nevada.\n- GMV’s 100 percent owned Mexican Hat gold project in Arizona is notable for its estimated 10-year mine life, low capex and a discounted pre-tax US$153 million NPV using a US$1,600 per oz base case. At US$2,240 per ounce the\nPEAindicates a discounted pre-tax NPV of US$395 million.\n- Mexican Hat hosts an inferred\n688,000 ounces of gold, excellent metallurgical results and a low strip ratio.\n- In Nevada, GMV has a three-year option agreement to earn a 100 percent interest in the Daisy Creek lithium project located in Lander County.\n- Both Daisy Creek and Mexican Hat are situated in safe, mining-friendly jurisdictions with readily available and experienced service providers. Each asset is also situated close to existing infrastructure, further reducing initial capex.\n- GMV is also noteworthy for its tightly held share structure, with 24 percent of shares held by management and advisors.\nKey Projects\nMexican Hat\nA low-sulphidation epithermal gold deposit, GMV’s 100-percent owned\nMexican Hat contains an estimated gold resource of 688,000 ounces across 5,000 acres. As GMV's flagship project, the company aims to further expand this resource through drilling, ultimately moving from an inferred resource estimate to a measured and indicated estimate. The mine development itself will consist of two pits — a smaller southeast pit will be mined first, followed by a larger pit to the north.\nMexican Hat project in Arizona\nHighlights:\n- Established Infrastructure: Located in close proximity to considerable transportation and power infrastructure, and a skilled workforce.\n- Well-established Mining Process: GMV plans to extract minerals from Mexican Hat through heap leaching, a mining process known for its low capital investment and operating costs, fast payback, lack of tailings, low energy and water requirements, and simple setup and operation.\n- Area Geology: Primary mineralization consists of gold and oxides in a metasomatic assemblage of chlorite, carbonate, epidote and minor silica arranged along a series of fractures and fault zones within a tilted conformable package of tertiary rock.\n- Mineral Resource Estimate: The results of Mexican Hat's\n2020 MREinclude an inferred resource of 688,000 ounces at 0.58 grams per ton (g/t) gold in 36.73 Mt with a cut-off of .20 g/t gold and a strip ratio of 2.36. Preliminary Economic Assessment: Mexican Hat's PEA, conducted with the updated 2020 MRE, indicates a 10-year mine life; $100 million NPV; $67.80 million initial capex; 29.30 percent IRR after tax at $1,600/ounce of gold; and average annual gold production of 52,250 ounces.\nDaisy Creek Lithium Project\nView across the Basin showing historical trenching from the 1970s; material trenched is a claystone.\nLocated in Lander County, Nevada,\nDaisy Creek consists of 165 lode claims. Initially targeted for uranium by multiple oil and mining companies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the project instead proved rich in lithium, displaying values of up to 2 percent in clay-altered volcanic tuffs, which geologists noted was likely hectorite-based.\nBecause there was very little demand for lithium at the time, Daisy Creek largely sat ignored and forgotten. It was not until several decades later that two of the geologists involved in the project's original drilling program noted multiple similarities between Daisy Creek and Lithium America's highly prospective Thacker Pass discovery. GMV plans to conduct a field program to confirm these observations.\nHighlights:\n- Full Ownership: In May 2023, GMV entered into a three-year option agreement with Daisy Creek's original owner, which will see it eventually gain a 100 percent interest in the project.\n- Area Geology: Daisy Creek is part of a mountainous formation primarily composed of crystal-rich, early Miocene era ash-flow tuff. Said formation covers roughly 200 square miles with a volcanic complex that contains a collapse-type or graben structure filled with finely laminated tuffs that likely host anomalous\nlithium reserves. The basin that hosts the project itself covers approximately 18 square miles and consists primarily of finely laminated fissile sediments.\n- Pre-existing Infrastructure: Daisy Creek is situated near several operating gold mines and has access to power, water and paved highways, considerably lowering the initial capital investment that will be required to develop the project.\n- Prospective and Promising: Daisy Creek displays similar geology to Lithium America's Thacker Pass deposit, with a\nmineral reserveof 3.7 Mt of lithium carbonate equivalent at 3,160 ppm lithium.\nManagement Team\nIan Klassen — President and CEO\nIan Klassen has 30 years of experience in public company management, public relations, government affairs, entrepreneurship, media relationship strategies and project management. Klassen is the president of a North American mineral exploration company and sits on the board of directors of several private and public companies. Previous to his management activities within private and public companies, he held a variety of positions within federal Canadian politics, including as senior political advisor to the Minister of State (Transportation), and as chief of staff, Office of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons. Klassen graduated with an undergraduate honors degree from Western University in 1989. In 1992, he received the Commemorative Medal for the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada in recognition of his significant contribution to his community and country.\nDr. D.R.

Webb graduated with a geological engineering degree from the University of Toronto, where he obtained awards for the highest marks in both third-year and fourth-year field camps. He obtained his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in geological sciences at Queen’s University and Western University, respectively, where his focus was on the structural and geochemical controls of gold mineralization in the Yellowknife Greenstone Belt. Webb is credited for discovering both the largest granitic-hosted gold deposit in the Northwest Territories and the largest gold deposit in the Yellowknife Greenstone Belt found in the past 30 years. He served as president and director of Tyhee Gold, where he and his team developed a high-grade gold deposit into production, becoming Mongolia’s first hard-rock gold mine. He later advanced his discoveries in Yellowknife into a multimillion-ounce resource, completed economic and engineering analysis and initiated both\nfeasibility studies and permitting.\nWebb also developed the Mon Gold Mine into the most recently permitted gold mine in the Yellowknife Gold Belt, operating for seven years and then shutting down in 1997. Webb is a consultant to the industry, providing services throughout the world and sits on the board of Lake Victoria Mining Company and Metallis Resources, several private corporations, and is on the advisory council for the Centre of Training Excellence in Mining. Webb co-authored the qualifying report on Fortune Minerals’ Nico Deposit, recommending the acquisition of what is now the largest bismuth resource in the world.\nMichele Pillon — Chief Financial Officer\nMichelle Pillon is an accountant with several years of experience in the junior mining exploration sector.

The Company released an updated Mineral Resource of 96koz at 4.8g/t Au (100% basis) on 11 April 2023.1\n- Vivien, previously owned and operated by Ramelius Resources Limited (\nASX: RMS) (“Ramelius”), will provide Labyrinth a near-term opportunity to define a JORC mineral resource across the Vivien Main Pit and Vivien Gem Prospect from the existing project drill database.\n- The Vendors of Distilled amongst others include Alex Hewlett and Kelvin Flynn. Alex and Kelvin have a strong track record, with one or both being involved in driving value creation at Red Dirt Metals Limited (now Delta Lithium), Spectrum Metals Limited, Mineral Resources Limited, Silver Lake Resources Limited and Wildcat Resources Limited.\n- Following completion of the Transactions and Equity Raising at full participation, Mr Hewlett and Mr Flynn are expected to emerge with voting power in Labyrinth of approximately 12.3% and 10.2% respectively.\n- Firm commitments received via a two tranche placement to raise $2.0 million in support of the Transactions and to fund high priority work programs.\n- Existing Labyrinth shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in a 1-for-1.9813 non-renounceable Entitlement Offer raising up to an additional ~$2.0m.\n§ The proceeds of the two tranche placement (“Placement”) and entitlement offer\n(“Entitlement Offer”) (together, the “Equity Raising”) will be used to advance exploration at both Comet Vale and Vivien with the aim of growing a significant and high-grade resource inventory.\n- Following completion of the Transactions and Equity Raising at full participation, Labyrinth will emerge with a pro-forma undiluted market capitalisation of ~$13.7m and pro-forma cash holdings of approximately $4.0m (before transaction costs and the exercise of the Comet Vale Option).\n- Post the Transactions, the Company will re-assess strategic options (including a potential sale) for its 100% owned Labyrinth Project in Canada which currently contains a JORC compliant resource of 3Mt @ 5g/t Au for 500koz2. This will include leveraging the geological skill set of the Company to further evaluate the prospectivity of the deposit at depth and along strike.\n- The Company has obtained in-principle confirmation from the ASX that Listing Rules 11.1.2 and 11.1.3 do not apply to the Transactions.\nOverview\nThe Comet Vale Option and Distilled Acquisition align with the Company’s strategy to consolidate and grow underexplored high grade gold mines across the Menzies, Leonora and Leinster corridor that are close to infrastructure.\nFigure 2: Regional location of Vivien.\nHistorical underground production from the Vivien leases between 1902 and 1911 totalled 76,000oz at an average grade of 12.4 g/t Au. The Vivien open pit was mined between 1997 and 1998 and produced 410,000 tonnes at 2.70 g/t Au for 35,600oz.3\nRamelius ceased mining at Vivien in early 2023, with the last ore load coming to surface on 11 January 2023. Gold production for Vivien over the period of Ramelius’ operatorship (2015-2023) was 1.5Mt at 5.68g/t Au for 260koz4 processed through its Mt Magnet Mill situated 296km west of Vivien. Vivien was acquired by Ramelius in 2013 from Gold Fields at a cost of $10 million and, over its life, generated net cash flows of $130 million for Ramelius.5\nVivien comprises five Mining Licences (M36/111, M36/292, M36/34, M36/61 and M36/64) and one Prospecting Licence (P36/1890) with an area of 20.4km².\nThe wider Vivien project provides a commercially compelling brownfield gold exploration opportunity with six (6) priority drill targets based on historical gold intercepts that were not prioritised by Ramelius as part of its mining focussed activities at Vivien.\nVivien provides Labyrinth a near-term opportunity to define a JORC mineral resource across the Vivien Main Pit and Vivien Gem Prospect from the existing project drill database. There are also five (5) separate gold processing mills within 100km of Vivien that potentially provide a lower commercial threshold to profitable gold production.\nhttps://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02828766-6A1216097&v=4015c7b87631faf94ecd96975272ff9ad5cb14c3\nThis article includes content from Labyrinth Resources, licensed for the purpose of publishing on Investing News Australia.

It is now up about 20 percent year-to-date.\nThis week's rise came on the back of a variety of factors, including safe-haven demand after the assassination attempt on former US President Donald\nTrump over the weekend. Comments made on Monday (July 15) by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also helped push gold higher — speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, he said the central bank will cut interest rates before inflation hits its much-discussed 2 percent target. June US retail sales data, which came out on Tuesday, was flat, reinforcing expectations that the Fed could make its first rate reduction in September. Gold tends to fare well when interest rates are low.\nAs of 5:00 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, gold was slightly lower than its record price, trading at US$2,467.25.\nNext stop for gold — US$2,500 and beyond?\nGold has US$2,500 clearly in sight, but what does its price trajectory look like once it gets there?\nDespite its historic run, many market participants believe the yellow metal still has further to go.\nLobo Tiggre, CEO of\nIndependentSpeculator.com, said he was optimistic about gold's prospects heading into 2024, but its price increase has come without the factors that made him bullish.\n\"The global macro context ... is extremely bullish for gold, and that's still ahead of us. That's still — the catalysts that I was expecting to bring gold to where we are now haven't happened yet. So starting from where we are now instead of US$2,000 I think makes it — it embarrasses me to put numbers on it, but it's a very positive direction for gold,\"\nhe told the Investing News Network (INN) at the Rule Symposium, held last week in Boca Raton, Florida.\nOpinions vary widely about exactly how positive the direction may be for gold during this bull market, but Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter,\nshared his forecast with INN at the same event.\n\"I think clearing US$2,400 for good — trading a few weeks above that level would be key,\" he said. \"Eventually I think we're going to go much higher. The timing of that is always the hard part. Getting back to where I think we're going to be at the end of this cycle, I think the\ngold price is going to be somewhere between US$6,000 and US$8,000.\"\nWhen will gold stocks finally move?\nWith the gold price historically high, market participants are hoping gold equities are next.\nWhile the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (ARCA:\nGDX) and the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (ARCA: GDXJ) are respectively up about 28 percent and 32 percent year-to-date, those increases haven't overshot gold's rise by much. Investors typically use gold stocks to get leverage on the gold price, meaning they are seeking much larger gains.\nMany experts believe generalist investors will become interested in gold stocks when gold miners start to release their second quarter results in the next month or so. Gold's 2024 price rise kicked off in earnest in Q2, meaning that it's the first quarter where companies will see the increase reflected on their balance sheets.\n\"I think we have an exceptionally rare and very, very attractive opportunity in the gold stocks,\" Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management,\ntold INN on the sidelines of the Rule Symposium.\n\"I think when companies start to report their second quarter earnings later this month, we're going to start to see some very attractive cashflow numbers — better than the first quarter and better than the year-ago comparisons,\" he explained in a conversation with INN. \"I've got to think that investors, when they see two back-to-back quarters of strong cashflow numbers, are going to start to look at these companies.\"\nDon’t forget to follow us\n@INN_Resource for real-time updates!\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Charlotte McLeod, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.
