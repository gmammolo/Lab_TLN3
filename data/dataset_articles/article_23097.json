  "text": "Trichy: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has brought state-of-the-art 4G connectivity to Kannuthu village in Marungapuri taluk, Trichy. The installation of a new 4G mobile tower provides mobile phone network coverage to the villagers, who previously struggled with poor connection.The tower was inaugurated by Karur MP S Jothimani and attended by Manapparai MLA P Abdul Samad. The project, implemented under the 4G saturation initiative through the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), aims to bridge the digital divide in rural areas.BSNL Trichy general manager Chandrasena Bala said the tower is equipped with a solar power panel and has been designed to provide seamless 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile coverage, serving a 5km radius and significantly enhancing connectivity for the local population.Previously, villagers had to climb a nearby hill to get a mobile signal, a challenge that became particularly acute during the Covid-19 pandemic. The hardships faced by the villagers were brought to the attention of BSNL by Telecom Advisory Committee members M A Selva and K K P Selvam, who advocated for the essential communication facility.We also published the following articles recentlyCancer detection van to function in remote villagesDiscover the new Rs 3 crore cancer detection mobile van in Goa!
