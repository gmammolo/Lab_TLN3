  "text": "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen won a second term on Thursday, after Green lawmakers agreed to back her following her pledge to stay the course on Europe's green transition while cushioning its burden on industry. Issued on: Von der Leyen was re-elected by members of the European Parliament for another five-year term in charge of the European Union's executive body with 401 votes in favour. She needed 361 votes from a total of 720 lawmakers. Addressing the parliament in Strasbourg before the vote, the centre-right von der Leyen laid out a programme focused on prosperity and security. She also stressed the need not to backtrack on the \"Green Deal\" transformation of the EU economy to fight climate change, a key pledge for Greens who were earlier undecided on whether to support her. \"The next five years will define Europe’s place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others,\" von der Leyen said ahead of the secret ballot on her candidacy. Ursula von der Leyen was born on 8 October 1958, in Brussels, Belgium, to German parents. Daughter of German politician Ernst Albrecht, she initially studied economics before switching to medicine, graduating from Hanover Medical School and earning a doctorate in 1991. After living in the US from 1992 to 1996, she returned to Germany and joined the Christian Democratic Union in 1990. Von der Leyen held various political roles, eventually becoming minister of family affairs in 2005 and then minister of labour and social affairs in 2009. She went on to make history as the first woman to serve as Germany’s minister of defence from 2013 to 2019. In that role she sought to reform the German armed forces and address NATO commitments amid crises like the annexation of Crimea and the 2015 refugee wave. In 2019, she succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker and become the first female president of the European Commission. Her first term included challenges from the Covid-19 pandemic to vaccine procurement scrutiny and the Russia-Ukraine war. She supported sanctions against Russia and military aid to Ukraine, while navigating Europe's energy crisis caused by reduced Russian gas supplies. She also sought to focus on gender equality and climate change. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz congratulated von der Leyen for securing another term. Her re-election is \"a clear sign of our ability to act in the European Union, especially in difficult times\", Scholz wrote on social media. Expanding Europe's defences After pledging to support Ukraine for as long as it takes in its fight against Russia, von der Leyen said Europe's liberty was at stake and it must invest more in defence. The former German defence minister pledged to create \"a true European Defence Union\", with flagship projects on air and cyber defence. She also blasted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow as an \"appeasement mission\", winning broad applause from lawmakers. Defence policy in Europe has traditionally been the domain of national governments and NATO. EU unveils €1.5 billion defence programme as Ukraine war persists But following Russia's attack on Ukraine and amid uncertainty over how much Europe will be able to rely on the United States for its protection should Donald Trump win the US presidential election in November, the European Commission is seeking to push more joint European defence projects. Von der Leyen also pledged to stick to the goals set out in the European Green Deal , a climate package that was one of the main policies of her first term. She promised a raft of climate policies including a legally binding EU target to cut emissions by 90 percent by 2040. She also pledged new measures to help European industries stay competitive while they invest in curbing emissions.
