  "text": "Sustainable City – Yas Island gets top urban design ratings ABU DHABI, 14 days ago The Sustainable City – Yas Island, which is being developed in Abu Dhabi by a partnership of Aldar Properties and SEE Holding, has received the prestigious Estidama 5 Pearl classification for the design of its homes. The rating is a testament to the partners’ commitment to social, environmental, and economic sustainability, according to the developers. The green building rating by Abu Dhabi’s Urban Planning Council is the highest available rating under the Pearl Villa Rating System (PVRS) and signifies excellence in sustainable development. It is characterised by advanced energy-efficient building designs, water conservation measures, integration of green spaces and pedestrian-friendly pathways, use of eco-friendly materials and dedication to enhancing both environmental quality and community wellbeing. Achieving the 5 Pearl rating, The Sustainable City – Yas Island homes will be powered by solar energy from panels installed on residential and parking structures, enabling residents to save up to 50 percent on energy bills. It is designed to promote energy and water efficiency along with featuring a central green spine running the length of the community and biodomes to encourage community farming, while a network of communal battery-charged buggies and bicycles will encourage walkability and accessibility for all. The construction of the project is underway, with the first handovers expected at the end of 2025. Faisal Falaknaz, Aldar's Group Chief Financial and Sustainability Officer, said: \"Sustainable City – Yas Island is a benchmark for building resilient and sustainable communities in the UAE and is a testament to both partners’ commitment to sustainable development.\" \"Supporting Aldar’s ambitious 2050 Net Zero target, the development provides a framework for the future of sustainable cities and supports the growing demand and expectation set by our customers for environmentally friendly and socially conscious living destinations, he stated. The community, he stated, will fit seamlessly into the wider Yas Island ecosystem which offers residents close proximity to serene natural spaces, leading educational institutions, and premier shopping, leisure, and entertainment destinations. Marwa Nahlawi, General Manager of Diamond Developers, the master planning and designing company under SEE Holding, said: \"Our model for future cities is designed to achieve the highest social, environmental, and economic sustainability standards.\" \"By developing a live-work-thrive community that reduces emissions and enhances the quality of life, we are setting a new standard for sustainable urban development,\" she noted. This recognition underscores our commitment to innovative design and sustainable practices, aligning perfectly with SEE Holding's mission to spearhead a net zero emissions future. We are proud to uphold Estidama’s standards in harmony with the UAE's ambitious net zero targets and are dedicated to expanding The Sustainable City’s footprint globally, providing a replicable model for future cities that prioritize sustainability, resilience, and community well-being,\" she added.-TradeArabia News Service",
