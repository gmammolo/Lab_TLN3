Ann and Maurice Doucet donated the land so the NCC could conserve the land, in perpetuity, for future generations.\n“When we take care of nature, we take care of ourselves,” said the donors in a press release.\nDoug Van Hemessen is the NCC’s stewardship manager for Nova Scotia. He said he was grateful to the Doucets for their “ecologically significant” donation.\n“That landscape protects that whole broad area of watershed that goes into Porters Lake and contributes to landscape protection and biodiversity protection throughout that whole area,” Van Hemessen said.\nThe NCC said the forest acts as a natural water filtration system, plays a crucial role in water cycling and creates a barrier against flooding and erosion. Van Hemessen said the forest reserve also provides opportunities for people to enjoy and learn about nature.\n“It’s important for all of us, for the sake of nature, but also the things that nature does for us, make sure we have clean water and clean air,” Van Hemessen said, noting the property is a birding hotspot. “There was about 92 species of birds that are confirmed in or around the property.”\nDarell Sampson, MP for Sackville-Preston-Chezzetcook, N.S., said the donation marked a great day for Porters Lake.\n“Protecting this land is forever – for our kids, grandkids and all future generations,” Samson said.\nSteven Guilbeault, minister of Environment and Climate Change, said donations from people like the Doucets help protect the natural environment in Nova Scotia and across the country.\n“Only by engaging in a whole-of-society approach can we meet our goal of conserving\n30 per cent of lands and waters in Canada by 2030,” Guilbeault said.\nBecause the Nature Conservancy of Canada is a non-profit organization, Van Hemessen said donations of land are critical to ensuring they can protect the most important parts of nature.\n“It’s just a win-win for everybody.”\nFor more Nova Scotia news visit our\ndedicated provincial page.\nAtlantic Top Stories\nCTVNews.ca Top Stories\nComedian Bob Newhart, deadpan master of sitcoms and telephone monologues, dies at 94\nBob Newhart, the deadpan accountant-turned-comedian who became one of the most popular TV stars of his time after striking gold with a classic comedy album, has died at 94.\n2 dead after small plane crashes in Tofino, B.C.\nTwo people died and a third was seriously injured in a fiery plane crash in Tofino, B.C., on Thursday, according to authorities.\nOnce defiant, Biden is now 'soul searching' about dropping out of race: Reuters source\nU.S. President Joe Biden is taking calls to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate seriously and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n'We had a good run': High-profile Liberal minister quitting cabinet, not running in next election\nLabour Minister Seamus O'Regan has announced he will not run in the next federal election, and will be quitting his cabinet position Friday.\nB.C. woman who thought Coldplay concert 'was a date' must pay ex for ticket, tribunal rules\nA B.C. woman has been ordered to repay her ex for a ticket to Coldplay's 2023 concert in Vancouver – in a small claims decision that highlights the distinction between gifts and loans under Canadian law.\nLou Dobbs, conservative pundit and Fox Business host, dies at 78\nLou Dobbs, the conservative political pundit and TV host who was a nightly presence on Fox Business Network for more than a decade, has died.
