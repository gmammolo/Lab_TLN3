  "text": "Lucknow: The country has officially got its first sweet road. Yes, you read it right. The use of sugarcane molasses as a replacement for bitumen has yielded successful results in a trial conducted on a road section constructed in western UP.A concept developed by experts from IIT Roorkee, the bio bitumen was used to construct 650 metres of the national highway that connects Muzaffarnagar to Shamli. The first such experiment in the country, the evaluation of the road section that was constructed in November 2022, gave desired results recently after having withstood the last monsoon season.Dubbed as bio bitumen, up to 30% of molasses could be used instead of the asphalt binder to provide the same kind of durability and shelf life.Both the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) and the public works department in Uttar Pradesh have taken note of the trial run that was conducted over a section of NH 709 AD (Panipat to Khatima highway) and are going to identify more sections where the formula could be used as an experiment before resorting to bio bitumen as a substitute.Engineer-in-chief and head of the department, Jitendra Kumar Banga, said, “In August, the faculty member of IIT Roorkee who has come up with the concept of molasses-based bio bitumen will train our engineers on various aspects related to road construction and engineering. We will explore the possibility of using the substitute but will take a final call only after conducting more trials in different conditions.”Assistant professor at IIT Roorkee, Nikhil Saboo, along with PhD fellow Dheeraj Mehta, came up with the formula. “The Muzaffarnagar-Shamli section where the experiment was conducted for the first time has given favourable results. We are in talks with MoRTH to execute two more national highways with the help of bio bitumen in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. I look forward to discussing the technology with PWD engineers during the upcoming training session in Lucknow,” said Saboo.The cost of constructing a kilometre of road with flexible pavement ranges between Rs 3 crore and Rs 4 crore, out of which the expenses incurred on layering the sub-base with bitumen account for 60%. With the usage of bio bitumen, the overall project cost is expected to go down significantly, besides also reducing the carbon footprint of the department and other road construction agencies and companies. In Uttar Pradesh, nine kilometres of road are constructed daily, said senior officials.",
