BROWARD COUNTY, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2025 MetroDesk Media, LLC) — A young Coral Springs man is dead following a multicar crash on Waterways Boulevard in Deerfield Beach. The Broward Sheriff’s Office provided this narrative to BocaNewsNow.com:\nAccording to investigators, around 10:51 p.m. on April 6, Broward County Regional Communications received a report of a two-car crash in the area of Southwest 10th Street and Waterways Boulevard. BSO deputies and Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue responded to the scene. The preliminary investigation revealed that the driver of a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta, Erick Mardirossian, was traveling eastbound on Southwest 10th Street. At that time, the driver of a 2015 Hyundai Sonata, Anthony R. Havens, was driving westbound on Southwest 10th Street and made a left turn to travel south on Waterways Boulevard.\nThe vehicles collided in the intersection, and following the collision, the Jetta struck a large pole. Both vehicles came to a stop along the south swale of Southwest 10th Street. Paramedics transported Mardirossian to Broward Health North where he was pronounced deceased.\nThe investigation into the circumstances of the crash is ongoing.",
