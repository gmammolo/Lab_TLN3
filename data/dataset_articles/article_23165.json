  "text": "[Fulshear Arts Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/FulshearArtsAlliance/)is working to beautify [Fulshear](https://www.fulsheartexas.gov/)with community artwork. At a July 16 meeting, Fulshear City Council approved several agreements to add art to traffic signal boxes, including a memorandum of understanding with the Fulshear Arts Alliance, artist releases and an agreement with the [Texas Department of Transportation](https://www.txdot.gov/). The overview In partnership with the city of Fulshear and Fulshear Parks & Recreation Commission, the Fulshear Arts Alliance will add artwork to eight traffic signal boxes across the city, Public Works Assistant Director Tiffany Stodder said. The traffic boxes will feature vinyl wraps of art pieces designed by local artists, according to agenda documents. The project was first suggested by the Fulshear Arts Alliance in September 2021. The details The proposed artwork was chosen via contest by the Fulshear Arts Alliance with final approval by the city of Fulshear, according to [agenda documents](https://www.fulsheartexas.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/4992). Artists will receive a compensation of $500 for a three-year lease of their artwork. Artists include: - Claudia Diaz - Hailey Ann Boothe - Addison Rives - Stacy Jacob - Lois Morton - Michelle Florence - Natalie Pollock The art box program is striving to bring beautification to the city by transforming blank spaces utilizing local artists. Multiple other cities in the region have also participated including Sugar Land, Missouri City and Houston, according to agenda documents. Additionally, the city of Katy has added artwork to three traffic boxes, [Community Impact reported](https://communityimpact.com/houston/katy-north/government/2024/03/01/new-traffic-box-mini-mural-coming-to-franz-road-in-katy/). Looking ahead Since the traffic boxes belong to the TxDOT, the city will need to execute an agreement to place the art on the boxes, Stodder said. Pending TxDOT approval, the soonest the city could begin to see art on boxes is late 2024, she said.",
