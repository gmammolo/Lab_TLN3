  "text": "The beautiful weather rolls on; some storm chances return next week Below-normal temperatures continue for another couple days QUAD CITIES, IA./Ill. (KWQC) -- It’s another beautiful day across the QCA. Sunshine and a few passing clouds highlight our weather for the remainder of today; clear skies will prevail through tonight. Lows will dip down again into the low 50s and even some 40s across the region. The low humidity continues into the end of our work week. Sun and clouds mixed with highs in the upper 70s and some low 80s to the south can be expected. Looking ahead to the weekend, we add a touch more humidity and some more cloud cover to our weather picture. While we should remain dry, we will be dealing with more of a partly cloudy sky, especially on Sunday. Next week, we will add some rain and storm chances into our forecast. These storm chances should be fairly minimal and widely scattered at best. Temps will approach the mid-80s, which is our average for this time of year. In the long-range, the trend will be slightly warmer than average as we head towards the end of the month into the start of August. TONIGHT: Clear. Low: 57°. Winds: Light and variable. TOMORROWT: Mostly sunny to partly cloudy. High: 80°. Winds: SE 5-10 mph. SATURDAY: Mostly sunny to partly cloudy. High: 82º. Copyright 2024 KWQC. All rights reserved.",
