  "text": "Leech Lake band celebrates the transfer of 11,000 acres that represent what was illegally taken\nThe Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe celebrated the transfer of more than 11,000 acres to the tribe this week. Federal officials at the celebration acknowledged they represent the nation who took the land away and who have now helped enable the return.\nChairman Faron Jackson Sr. described the transfer as “the largest achievement by the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe to restore the land base of our permanent homeland since it was originally established.”\nAn emotional Jackson told the assembled audience Wednesday at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School in Bena, “to us, to me, it feels like it’s a relative,” said Jackson. “It’s a relative of ours.”\nIn the late 1940s and ‘50s, the federal government illegally transferred thousands of acres away from the tribe. Leadership of the Bureau of Indian Affairs incorrectly believed it could sell land without the consent of a majority of tribal landowners. At the time, an estimated 18,000 acres were involved.\nAs they identified parcels to be returned to the tribe, federal surveyors found an additional four thousand acres that were illegally taken.\nU.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who sponsored legislation to address the larger parcel, said she will make sure more land is transferred to represent the recent discoveries.\n“I will not rest until that piece of work is done,” the Minnesota Democrat said.\nU.S. Rep. Betty McCollum worked on the Leech Lake effort and offered an apology to band members.\n“When you entered into a treaty with the United States government, you thought you were entering into something that was going to be honored and respected by the federal government and then it was illegally transferred out of trust status,” said McCollum.\nMichael Chosa, the communications director for Leech Lake, said the tribe worked with the Chippewa National Forest in choosing which parcels to transfer.\nSeveral of the parcels will provide band members with direct access to Lake Winnibigoshish for the first time in many decades. Chosa said the agreement made with the Chippewa National Forest honors existing public easements and right-of ways. Chosa added the tribe doesn’t plan to close any roads.\nAgriculture Under Secretary Homer Wilkes said the return of land to Leech Lake will serve as “a template” for tribal land returns around the country.\nLt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, a tribal citizen of White Earth Nation, emphasized the land transfer to tribes “is intentional, detailed, hard work that we do together.”\nThe tribe shares more than 2,000 miles of boundary with the Chippewa National Forest, among the most of any tribal nation in the country. Nearly 40 percent of the forest lies within Leech Lake reservation, a geography it shares with Cass County.\nCass County Commissioner Neal Gaalswyk said he’s proud of what the county and tribe have done together. In 2014, the two governments signed a memorandum of understanding directing both governments to consult with each other over policies that affect both governments.\n“Before we act, we talk. That’s good advice in any relationship,” said Gaalswyk. “This attitude, this way of doing business, has transformed, it has literally transformed the relationship between the county and the tribe.”\nLeech Lake Chairman Jackson also said some of the land will be used to address the shortage of housing on the reservation.\n“With all this land that’s being returned, we’re going to have more available land to build homes for our members that are experiencing homelessness today,” said Jackson.\n“That’s a priority for the council.”",
