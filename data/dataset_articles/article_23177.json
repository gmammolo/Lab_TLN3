  "text": "SEATTLE — Activists working to save a large Douglas fir in Seattle may have convinced a developer to redesign plans to build housing around the tree instead of cutting it down. The Douglas fir has been named Vida and those working to protect it said it grows out of the edge of a property in the 1000 block of S Cloverdale Street in South Park. The property is where eight townhomes are slated to be built but a single-family home currently occupies the lot. An arborist designated the Douglas fir as “non-exceptional” and approved its removal, according to filings with Seattle’s Department of Construction and Inspections. The developer was then tasked with replanting two smaller sugar maples to make up for the loss. Joelle King, along with neighbors and activists from Tree Action Seattle and other organizations, petitioned the city to preserve the tree. They submitted comments calling for a public meeting and a redesign of the project to spare the Douglas fir. King also posted about the tree on Facebook. Robert Humble with Hybrid Architecture, the company that designed the project, came across Facebook and upon closer inspection realized it was his company that planned to remove the tree. On Thursday, KOMO News called Hybrid Architecture to confirm if the tree would be cut down or spared and the townhomes reconfigured. “My architecture firm is a strong believer in density, especially in areas with mass transit, but also a strong believer in the environment and we are trying to achieve both,” Humble told KOMO News in an interview. Humble said the tree sits at the edge of the lot and is a good candidate to be preserved while still moving forward with the housing project. The company is now working through a round of corrections and revisions that could take several weeks to complete but he believes it would be viable to have both the additional housing and still preserve the Douglas fir. “Our vision is aligned with the activists,” Humble said. “Bottom line is we are balancing the location of the trash, parking and required amenity area and requirements of city arborist and their own arborist and believe we can save the tree. We recognize the value of the tree and we think it adds value to the project.” Activists still plan to hold a gathering at 7 p.m. near the tree because nothing is finalized. They point out that South Park is one of the city’s most deforested neighborhoods, with only 12% tree canopy compared to Seattle's 28% average. They said developers should not trade trees for concrete.",
