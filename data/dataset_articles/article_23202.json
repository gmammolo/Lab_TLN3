  "text": "Woodworker in Bennet gives wood a second life with small business BENNET, Neb. (KOLN) - Sometimes what you need to get a job done, may not be too far from home. A woodworker in Bennet uses locally-sourced wood to create kitchen items as well as beautiful custom made pieces with his own hands. “A piece of wood can have more than one purpose,” said Nathan Nelson, owner of [Rooted Woodworking](https://www.facebook.com/rootedwoodworking/). “It’s functional for many years, until weather and elements take its toll on it.” Nathan gives weathered wood a second life as planters, pens, ice cream scoops, honey dippers and cutting boards. It’s a hobby that’s followed him since taking classes in junior high and high school. Nathan said his faith in God inspired him to start his small business in 2013. “And that’s kind of the basis of how I want to run this business - root in Him, overflowing with the gratitude of the gifts that he has provided me with to do this sort of thing,” Nathan said. Alongside utensils, the craftsman also tackles personalized projects. He framed a fireplace for Tim Judge. “His measurements and drawings were so accurate that he was spot on,” Judge said. “And I really was shocked when he brought it in and put it together - how seamless it all was.” No job is too big or too small. Nathan even designed awards for alumni of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Marching Band. “I’m a sucker for handmade artisan work, and that was something that we decided that we wanted as a board, instead of the plain old plaques,” said Elizabeth Chase, UNL Marching Band alum. “We wanted something unique and different.” Nathan and his wife Kristin both marched in the band, making the awards a full circle moment for the couple. “He’s had the opportunity to turn it into his livelihood,” Kristin Nelson said. “And so it’s been neat to watch it grow from one little thing to now a variety of things - doing it well.” Nelson creates rolling pins, pizza cutters, picture frames, egg holders and many other items that add to the popularity of the “farmhouse style.” Rooted Woodworking is sold at [ Antique Anthology](https://www.1011now.com/2024/06/01/antique-shop-offers-small-town-charm-big-city-style-bennet/) in Bennet and [ Anchor Meadow Farm](https://www.1011now.com/2024/02/05/small-farm-milford-raises-breed-pig-new-zealand/) outside of Milford.
