  "text": "From pre-loved clothing and handbags to furniture and books, the trade in secondhand merchandise is growing rapidly in China — delivering not only bargains, but also green benefits. The trend represents a change in Chinese people's mindset, as more consumers are recognizing the value of extending the life span of products through reuse and recycling. By embracing the secondhand market, they are not only finding cost-effective alternatives but also contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly way of life through the recycling of goods. Kang Lin, in her 40s, is originally from Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and now calls Hong Kong home. A seasoned traveler, she lived in Oxford, the United Kingdom, for a year and a half, Shanghai for a year, and Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, for 12 months. For Kang, buying secondhand goods is more than just a cost-saving measure — it's a lifestyle choice that celebrates sustainability and uncovers hidden treasures from the past. \"When I lived overseas, buying secondhand was the most cost-effective option since these items were inexpensive, and I didn't mind discarding them when I left,\" she said. \"It's also environmentally friendly, as it prevents usable items from going to waste — my unwanted items may be desired by others, and vice versa.\"",
