  "text": "Two sea turtles return to ocean after months of rehabilitation\nIt was a special morning at Loggerhead Marinelife Center where two sea turtles made their way back home.\nA moment of joy:\nNews We Love\nThis is the first time in several years that a green sea turtle was released publicly by Loggerhead Marinelife Center.\nMarge is about 100 pounds and was found between barges in the Jupiter inlet. Marge had to have a rear flipper amputated. Scout is a male loggerhead who is 30 years old and is eager to make his way back into the ocean.\nShare with us:\nUpload your photos and videos via uLocal\nScout weighs 220 pounds after recovering from a boat strike in Port. St. Lucie. Hundreds gathered at Juno Beach to cheer these beloved sea creatures on.\nDr. Heather Barron is the lead Veterinarian at Loggerhead Marinelife Center and nursed Scout and Marge back to health.\n\"One of the interesting things you'll notice about Scout today is that he is wearing a satellite tag,\" said Dr. Barron. \"And the satellite tag will allow us to potentially track scout for about a year or more. And it'll give us more information on where these turtles go.\"\nYou can track Scout's journey as well as other sea turtles on their website at\nmarinelife.org.",
