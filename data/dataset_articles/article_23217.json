  "text": "The federal government is spending $89 million to fund 10 greenhouse gas emission reduction projects as the government works toward the goal of conserving 30 per cent of the country’s land and water by 2030. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault made the announcement in British Columbia on Thursday, where he said the “evidence of climate change is striking,” referencing extreme weather events including flooding, drought and “devastating” wildfire seasons. “With the goal of reversing biodiversity loss across the country, bit by bit, we’re getting there, protecting prime lands and waters that serve up some of the most important habitats for imperilled species.” He added that the projects are also aiding in the fight against climate change. Guilbeault told the conference in West Vancouver that about $50 million of the funding is slated for major projects in the province. He later noted that some projects have been in the works for some time and have already put that money to use. “Often we will quietly work with organizations and Indigenous nations behind the scenes and then once the project are almost completed, we can make we can make the announcement like we’re doing this morning,” he said Thursday. Among funds already put to use is $37 million for the BC Parks Foundation, which it received through the Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund. Andrew Day, the foundation’s CEO, told the conference that the project had “already protected” 30 locations, covering about 4,000 hectares of private grasslands, forests and wetlands of Vancouver Island, the Southern Interior and northern B.C. Guilbeault said the project also benefits several species at risk, such as coho salmon, the great blue heron and other migratory birds. The Nature Trust of British Columbia has been allocated $8 million to preserve 552 hectares of “carbon-rich ecosystems” and protect habitats including grasslands, forests and wetlands that are home to at-risk species including the Western toad, Grizzly bears and southern mountain caribou. “Additionally, the project will result in the creation of 11 new protected areas including forest, wet land and grassland habitats on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, the East Kootenay, and in the Cariboo region,” Guilbeault said. The Nuxalk Nation will also receive more than $4 million to protect lands and animals in priority habitats, including the Great Bear Rainforest near Bella Coola. Blair Mack, elected councillor for Nuxalk Nation, called the move a “small but important step toward true reconciliation.” “The Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund has allowed the Nuxalk Nation the opportunity to purchase culturally significant private lands and take back under control of the nation,” he told the conference. Other projects being funded through the federal Nature Smart Climate Solutions Fund will take place in Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Quebec.
