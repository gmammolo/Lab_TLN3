  "text": "( MENAFN - Colombo Gazette) The United States (US) is helping strengthen Sri Lanka's preparedness for climate-related emergencies.\nThe US Government, through the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) donated vital equipment to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) via the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).\nThis consignment, part of a broader U.S. $2.5 million (approximately LKR 760 million) USAID-funded WFP project, complements government efforts to improve its disaster risk management capacities.\nThe consignment, comprising submersible water pumps, kitchen sets, chainsaws, polysack bags, and tarpaulins, was handed over at an event by Dustin Shiau, USAID BHA's Regional Humanitarian Advisor for South and Central Asia to Major General (Retired) Udaya Herath, Director General of the DMC, alongside officials from the Sri Lankan government and WFP.\n“Helping save lives, protect property, and reduce the impact of disasters on populations is at the core of U.S. humanitarian disaster response efforts in Sri Lanka and worldwide. The United States through USAID has been working with Sri Lanka's disaster management authorities to augment their preparations to prevent and mitigate disasters and their impact on at-risk populations – a critical first step in the disaster management process. Our support to disaster preparedness reflects the values of the American people and the continued strong partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka to ensure critically needed assistance reaches the most vulnerable during their times of need,” said Chargé\nd'Affaires Doug Sonnek of the U.S. Embassy to Sri Lanka.\n“Effective preparedness is critical in saving lives and livelihoods and preventing hazards from turning into disasters,” said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Sri Lanka's Representative and Country Director.\n“As climate change intensifies, our efforts are channelled towards mitigating its impact to safeguard people and their access to food and nutrition. We are grateful for the continued support from the United States in strengthening Sri Lanka's ability to better prepare for climate shocks.”\nRecent flooding caused by the South-west monsoon affected 20 of the country's 25 districts. A WFP-led joint rapid assessment mission was carried out in the aftermath of the floods by humanitarian and Government of Sri Lanka partners to understand the needs of affected communities.\nThe findings also highlighted government priorities to support its response efforts. The prepositioning of items is one of many U.S.-funded initiatives to support Sri Lanka to ensure it is prepared to swiftly assist affected communities during emergencies, including climate-induced disasters.\nThe United States is one of WFP's largest donors globally. Through USAID, WFP has assisted Sri Lanka in times of emergencies, while supporting in rebuilding fragile food systems and promoting access to better nutrition.\nMENAFN18072024000190011042ID1108455278",
