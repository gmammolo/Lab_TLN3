  "text": "These solutions empower residents, industries and smart grids to transition seamlessly to clean energy, address global warming, and also translate to significant cost savings on fuel and electricity.As Thailand moves towards becoming the regional Electric vehicles (EVs) hub, the transition to a greener energy structure is bringing ongoing investment opportunities and environment impact. To accelerate this process, technological innovation and proactive deployment is essential. In line with this trend, Huawei's digital power solutions aim to promote renewable energy adoption, encouraging both residents and businesses to embrace a sustainable future.Speaking at the ASEAN Sustainable Energy Week 2024 in Bangkok, Logan Yu, president of Huawei Thailand's digital power business, he emphasized that \"We all live in a world of energy: The tide ebbs and flows, the sun rises and sets, and the wind and clouds change. Energy surrounds us everywhere. The core question is how to use technology and digital means to better use renewable energy in our daily lives,\"He highlighted Huawei's digital power is committed to integrating digital and power electronics technologies to develop clean energy and energy digitalization, helping clean energy become a main energy source which is secure, stable, efficient, and easy to manage, and support energy security and energy efficiency innovation throughout Thailand.Apart from green home scenarios, industrial and data center sectors are increasingly turning to renewable energy to reduce electricity costs and achieve carbon neutrality with scalable effect.ULTRA-FAST CHARGINGFollowing a successful rollout in China, Thailand is the first country in Asia Pacific region where Huawei has introduced the FusionCharge Liquid-cooled Ultra-fast Charging Solution, also known as the ‘Liquid-cooled Power Unit'.To build a user-friendly, grid-friendly and operation-sustainable Smart Charging Network, is very important for both the EV industry and EV drivers.Huawei Full Liquid-cooled Ultra-Fast Charger offers a better experience with charging speed of 200 kilometers in five minutes, or 1 second per km. This makes it the fastest EV charging system in the market, Mr. Yu said.\"The Liquid-cooled system reduces heat compared to air-cooled charging, which generates excess heat and takes 15-20 minutes to complete the charging. This innovation addresses a major pain point for EV users,\" he added.\"This is a significant leap forward for Thailand's growing of smart technology infrastructure and future trend smart charging and clean energy,\" Mr. Yu said.The power unit boasts a maximum power output of up to 720 kilowatts, quieter overall operation, and a unit lifespan of up to 10 years. It adopts a power-sharing matrix to save power grid capacity and improve power utilization, supporting 4-12 charging connectors or dispensers.Although the capital expense of this solution is higher than that of a conventional charging station, it offers a quicker return on investment within three years. \"Fast charging increases turnover for car charging users, and the system can allocate power to other connectors if a user is parked for an extended period,\" Mr. Yu explained.High quality charge network, is demanding in Thailand.Huawei GREEN HOME Revolutionizing Household EnergyTraditionally, many households have adopted small-capacity solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for specific needs, such as solar water heating systems.However, after years of research and development, Huawei Digital Power launched a comprehensive GREEN HOME solution catering to all home energy scenarios, marking a significant leap towards sustainable living.The GREEN HOME solution highlights more advanced technologies, which include: Battery Energy Storage System (BESS): Featuring a 10-year warranty and adhering to stringent safety standards, the BESS eliminates fire risks, ensuring peace of mind for users. Optimizer: This device enhances safety by reducing the voltage to a secure 30V within 30 seconds. AI-Powered Management System: Leveraging artificial intelligence, this system dynamically manages solar energy, BESS, AC charger and grid systems based on consumption behavior, Big-Data, and predictive algorithms, optimizing energy efficiency. Notably, the system is scalable up to 83 kWh, accommodating varying energy needs and being adjustable for upgrade and scaling. With Huawei BESS solution, house owners are able to store excess solar energy during daytime and utilize the energy when needed. Therefore, Huawei GREEN HOME solution enable solar energy from day to night. Paving the Way to Carbon NeutralityThe GREEN HOME system, now more than just a concept, is poised to play a pivotal role in Thailand's 2050 carbon neutrality roadmap. By providing a robust and adaptable energy solution, Huawei Digital Power is empowering households to contribute to a sustainable future.Recently, the Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE) announced that the new tax reduction scheme for households installing rooftop solar panels is expected to be finalized by July 2024. Any household purchasing solar roof solution with a power generation capacity less than 10 kilowatts can participate in the program with a maximum 200,000 THB tax deduction. The DEDE expects 90,000 households to participate within the next 2 years. With this announcement, we can expect the rise of solar roof users in households - paving the way to carbon neutrality in Thailand's household.Logan Yu, President of Huawei Digital Power Thailand, highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating, \"Our GREEN HOME systems are designed to support Thailand's journey towards carbon neutrality by 2050. Through integrating advanced digital and power electronics technologies, we aim to make clean energy a mainstay in every household, ensuring energy security and efficiency across the nation.\"As Huawei Digital Power continues to drive clean energy advancements, the GREEN HOME solution stands as a testament to their dedication to environmental sustainability and technological innovation.",
