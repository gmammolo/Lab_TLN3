  "text": "NEXT Young Professionals presented a $500 check to Scotts Bluff National Monument on Wednesday afternoon. The check came from proceeds of the organization’s Spring Up the Bluff fundraiser, which was held in May. The event is a race up the Monument featuring multiple categories for all ages. “We usually do it during National Parks Week to raise awareness for National Parks, and ours that we have here,” NEXT board member Taylor Eckman said. Monument Chief Ranger Justin Cawiezel expressed his gratitude for the donation and shared what the money would be used for. “Donation funds like this go toward providing services to visitors who come to our park,” Cawiezel said. “It’s specifically tied to visitor enjoyment in the parks, and is much appreciated.” Cawiezel said that visitors to the Monument number just under 200,000 each year, making it an important economic driver for the entire North Platte River Valley. People are also reading… He also shared some history of the Spring Up the Bluffs event, and how NEXT ended up running the show. “Years ago it was an event started by the National Parks Service here as a community engagement event,” he said. “As it became a heavier lift over time, they dropped the event. NEXT Young Professionals contacted us saying they remembered it and wanted to bring it back.” He said that NEXT now does most of the heavy lifting to put the event on each year, and donates the money raised back to the park. He complimented the group’s management of the event and the impact it makes on the park and the community. Eckman explained that NEXT offers opportunities for young professionals to give back to their community while also building relationships with individuals and organizations across the Panhandle. “It’s geared toward networking with professionals in the community,” Eckman said. “We do networking activities to bring professionals together, and we use some of those activities as fundraisers.” Other events put on by NEXT include its annual Beer & Wine Fest held in downtown Scottsbluff.
