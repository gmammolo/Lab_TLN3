  "text": "The communities of Gulargambone and Menindee can look forward to high-speed and reliable Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) internet, thanks to an agreement between the NSW Government and telco infrastructure provider, Opticomm announced today. This initiative is part of the NSW Government's $250 million investment in digital infrastructure to future-proof connectivity for rural, regional, and remote NSW communities. More than 800 homes and businesses across Gulargambone and Menindee will be eligible for a fibre internet connection, with premises along Menindee Lakes' Sunset Strip also set to benefit. This initiative is an example of the government bringing metropolitan equivalent services to rural NSW, bridging the digital divide and reducing the current dependency on satellite services. The new fibre network replaces the unreliable and limited internet currently available and will ensure these communities have reliable infrastructure and affordable, high-speed internet services. Digital connectivity is critical to fuelling regional development, fostering community wellbeing, and providing rural and remote citizens with access to telehealth, education and other online services. Improved internet connectivity has many benefits including support for students doing home-based learning, adults seeking jobs or engaged in online education, aids businesses with faster access for cloud computing and teleconferencing, enhances family entertainment options, and strengthens connections with loved ones and the community. Planning and design for the Gulargambone and Menindee fibre network will commence in the coming months, with construction expected to start in late 2025. For more information visit: [www.nsw.gov.au/connectregionalnsw](https://www.nsw.gov.au/connectregionalnsw) Minister for Agriculture, Regional NSW and Western NSW, Tara Moriarty said: \"The NSW Government is committed to improving opportunities and choice across rural and remote communities.\" \"We want our rural and regional communities to have the benefits of online education, entertainment, telehealth and other online services. \"Through this initiative, more than 800 families and businesses in Gulargambone and Menindee will be eligible to enjoy a second to none fibre connection to their premises, with access to over 40 internet service providers allowing them to select an affordable internet plan that's right for them.\" Independent State Member for Barwon, Roy Butler said: \"Poor connectivity out West has many trickle-down impacts in regional and remote communities. When we cannot connect, we lose business, tourism, education, and telehealth opportunities, which are lifelines to places like Menindee and Gulargambone. Weather-related events that take out our telecommunications network can isolate towns that already feel disconnected. Using fibre to mitigate these weather events means communities can be sure they remain connected and can continue to run their households and businesses without disruption. This is a welcome announcement from the NSW Government.\" Opticomm Chief of Infrastructure Networks and Technology, Geoff Aldridge said: \"We're pleased to partner with the NSW Government to deploy a Fibre to the Premises network capable of super-fast speeds, that will support these communities with more than enough bandwidth now and into the future.\" \"Opticomm will use next generation technology to deliver a Fibre to the Premises network to more than 800 addresses within Gulargambone and Menindee. \"As the second largest fibre wholesaler in Australia, Opticomm has a long-standing history of building, owning and operating fibre networks that are future-proofed with potential speeds of up to 8 gigabits per second (Gbps).\" General Manager Darling Central Shire Council, Greg Hill said: \"Central Darling Shire welcomes this new agreement, which will deliver high-speed and reliable internet for the community of Menindee and residents along Sunset Strip. \"Menindee residents and businesses will be able to keep pace with the digital world through faster downloads, seamless streaming, and reliable access to government or online health services.\" General Manager Coonamble Shire Council, Paul Gallagher said: \"Fibre to the Premises internet unlocks a world of possibilities for Gulargambone, and we'd like to thank the NSW Government for making this a reality. \"Our existing rural businesses will be empowered to innovate and deliver services more efficiently than ever before, ensuring our local economy is future-proofed and allowing our community to thrive in the digital age. \"High-speed fibre internet also provides families and students with reliable and efficient platforms for their study and online activities.\" [here](/better-connection-for-gulargambone-and-menindee-1279030/).",
