  "text": "The law was put into place back on April 15. KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) - The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Association says they believe an alcohol ban inside all wildlife management areas is working. The law was put into place back on April 15. Previous Coverage: TWRA set to ban alcohol on Wildlife Management Areas Before then, the TWRA investigated three different crashes involving alcohol this year. Since April 15, there haven’t been any crashes, and officials said they see more people coming out to visit the areas. “There are lives being saved and people are being safer. We’re having more families come out. I’m checking more people with their kids and their families. And they’re happy and praise that this law has went into effect because they feel more safe bringing their kids and and families out to enjoy this recreational activity,” said TWRA Sgt. Dustin Burke. TWRA officers issue citations for alcohol possession. Burke added that Tennessee DUI laws also apply on local roads and managed trails within the Wildlife Management Areas. Exceptions to the law where you can have alcohol include designated campgrounds and waterways on agency property. Copyright 2024 WVLT. All rights reserved.",
