  "text": "Glass recycling options expand in Chattanooga\nLearn more about Overlooked Materials, a local company bringing curbside glass recycling services to residents and businesses in Chattanooga.\nWhen it comes to glass recycling, Chattanooga has lacked curbside collection options since 2018 + local processing services since the 1980s. Newly launched recycling company\nOverlooked Materials is here to change that.\nFounded by Morgan Holl, Overlooked Materials is dedicated to building a more sustainable future by focusing efforts on glass recycling. Holl found that after the city terminated curbside glass recycling services,\n90% of area glass ended up in landfills.\nPreviously, if you wanted to recycle glass in Chattanooga, you would have to drive it to a recycling center. Now, curbside collection is available residentially for\nsingle and multi-family homes + commercially for businesses in Chattanooga, Red Bank, and Lookout Mountain.\nFolks can select the best option to fit their recycling needs to receive collection bins. Overlooked Materials will then pick up glass according to its\npickup schedule — easy peasy.\nNote: If you live outside of the initial service area, you can\njoin the waitlist + let the company know where you would like services to be expanded to.\nWant to know how your glass is recycled? Overlooked Materials processes the glass locally in its warehouse located at 951 S. Watkins St. By utilizing a specially designed glass pulverizing system, the glass is crushed into\nsand + pea gravel materials, which can be used in local construction and landscaping projects.\nBonus: The sand and gravel are available for purchase by the community + businesses — see how you can\nuse these materials for your next project.\nSpeaking of the warehouse location. Folks can visit the space during the monthly open house events to check out the museum dedicated to sharing Chattanooga’s\nglass history. You can find old bottles from the area + read news clippings from years past. Bonus: Groups can take a tour of the space by inquiring .\nWant to learn more? Overlooked Materials’ next open house will be on Saturday, July 27 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. You can also follow the\nInstagram page for future community events + company updates.",
