  "text": "500 saplings of champak, jackfruit, & others were planted at KR Puram on Wednesday A community-driven movement to boost greenery and promote sustainable living took a significant step with a tree plantation drive at the BSF Karahalli campus near Nandi Hills. The main goal of the drive was to plant native trees to support local ecosystems and help the environment. The initiative, undertaken by the Jeevanmukti Foundation and HSR Citizen Forum, drew enthusiastic participation from volunteers and local residents, all eager to contribute to environmental conservation. They provided the necessary support and expertise to ensure that the plantation drive was carried out smoothly. A key highlight was the planting of 400 native trees. The forum chose these trees to enhance biodiversity, support local wildlife, and help fight climate change. With many coming together, the initiative had a lively and positive atmosphere, showing the power of community action in tackling environmental challenges. “We chose this location because of the success we’ve had here before,” said BNS Ratnakar, a principal office bearer of the HSR Citizen Forum. “The Jeevanmukti Foundation has already planted 1,000 tree saplings on this campus, which gave good results. This made it a natural choice for our current initiative.” Among the 400 saplings planted were 39 different varieties of jackfruit plants, which were sourced from accredited nurseries to ensure quality. Teja Nursery in Dodaballapura provided 35 varieties, while the remaining varieties came from other nurseries. This diversity is expected to boost the ecological balance of the area. The tree plantation drive at BSF Karahalli shows what can be achieved when communities come together for a common cause. It’s an excellent example of how collective efforts can lead to significant environmental benefits, contributing to a greener and more sustainable future, said Ratnakar. “Such initiatives are crucial in the fight against climate change and environmental degradation. They foster a sense of community and shared responsibility, inspiring more people to take part in similar activities. The success of this event sets a positive example for future efforts aimed at enhancing greenery and promoting environmental sustainability,” he added.
