  "text": "AG: 11 people charged in connection with Curtis Bay open-air drug market; 7 already arrested\nAn open-air drug market was dismantled in south Baltimore with nearly a dozen members of an organized ring charged, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said.\nDrugs and the violence that comes with it are nothing new to the Curtis Bay neighborhood. For years, 11 News has been speaking with the people who live there, who have raised concerns about the fears they face each day.\n\"We will not tolerate groups like this one that ignore the strategies mandate to put down the guns, who contribute to the proliferation of illegal narcotics on our streets and continue to do harm in our communities,\" said Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott.\nScott joined Brown, the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, Baltimore City police and DEA officials to share progress.\n\"We make Baltimore safer by removing those who pedal poison from our streets,\" Brown said.\nThe investigation started in September 2024. Officials found that the group was operating in the Morrison Court area of Curtis Bay selling fentanyl, heroin and cocaine, and tied it to violence in West Baltimore.\n\"Among those indicted, nine of these suspects have prior records, including charges for carjacking, armed robbery, assault and handgun violations,\" said Baltimore City Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Jones.\nInvestigators seized nine handguns, three Glock switches and more than 1,500 individually packaged drugs destined for distribution. They said the drug traffickers would store them at vacant properties.\n\"To those criminals who operate in Maryland and in the nation, please pay attention to these next words. Know that we will use everything that we have to come after you,\" said Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Washington Division Ibrar Mian. \"Know that we are working tirelessly to bring you to justice.\"\nCharges include illegal possession of firearms and distribution of fentanyl. In total, 11 people have been charged, but four are yet to be arrested.\nOfficials said Colby Brown, 22, Rayquan Ford, 23, Kairie Harrison, 23, and Markel Hawkins, 23, should turn themselves in.\nIf you have information on their whereabouts, you contact BPD or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-756-2587, or visit the link.
