  "text": "IMPACT through upcycling and recycling credits on PCX Markets, which helps fund plastic waste recovery, skyrocketed by 1,500 percent in 2023 as large corporations looked for new ways to meet sustainability goals and compliance requirements. The sale of those credits helped fund the upcycling or recycling of 9,000,000 kg plastic waste last year alone.\nThe jump in demand for credits issued by recycling and upcycling projects, which channel much-needed funding into the waste management sector, illustrates how the Philippines' new Extended Producer Responsibility Act is fueling the effective and economically viable development of a circular economy.\nOne of the projects on the PCX Markets platform is an upcycler based in Bulacan that uses plastics from beverage cartons and other low-value flexible items, like sachets, to create boards for use in construction and furniture. An overall rise in demand for credits in 2023 helped support this upcycler's operating costs; as a result, they aim to triple their processing capacity by September of 2024.\nPET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles rank as one of the most recycled and upcycled waste materials. CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Another project on the marketplace, based in Davao, recycles PET bottles into flakes that can be used in various products such as plastic containers, PET straps and fibers used in clothing. Rising demand for credits has helped reduce the volatility brought on by fluctuations in demand for flakes, giving this recycler the confidence to invest in more capacity for 2024 and beyond. The recycler estimates that the new infrastructure will allow them to process an additional 1 million kg of plastic waste into flakes every month, representing a 15 percent increase over last year.",
