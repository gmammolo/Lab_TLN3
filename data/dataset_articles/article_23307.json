  "text": "The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) organised a two-day training programme on the “Use of ornamental plants for landscaping”, to keep the city dwellers and villagers aligned with the latest trends of landscaping. Dr Kuldeep Singh, head, department of extension education and associate director (skill development), observed that the floriculture and landscaping has proved to be a sustainable lucrative business as the demand for flowers as well as ornamental plants has always seen a spurt in hotels, educational institutions, community places and parks, religious places, homes, farm houses, etc. Be it small- or large-scale floral business, farmers, nurseries and amateurs are earning substantially, thus changing the entire socio-economic landscape of the concerned rural and urban citizens, he added. The programme coordinator Prerna Kapila said that the training programme was planned keeping in the mind the rising preference for the use of ornamental plants for landscaping at the rooftop of the houses, farms or other surrounding areas. The resource persons Parminder Singh, head, department of floriculture and landscaping; KK Dhatt, Rishu Sharma, Ranjit Singh, Tanya Thakur, Simrat Singh, Madhu Bala and Aman Sharma whetted the skills of the trainees on different aspects of landscaping.
