  "text": "Greater Shepparton City Council, in collaboration with the Shepparton Library, hosted a highly successful 'Home Energy Efficiency Talk' on Thursday 11 July. In Summary - Council and Shepparton Library hosted a successful 'Home Energy Efficiency Talk' with guest speakers Tim Forcey and Geoff Lodge. - The event was fully booked with 51 attendees participating in an informative presentation and engaging Q&A session. - Attendees learned practical tips on reducing energy use and enhancing home comfort year-round. - Positive feedback received has spurred interest in future events focusing on household energy efficiency. Guest speakers Tim Forcey, energy efficiency specialist and author of \"My Efficient Electric Home Handbook\", and Geoff Lodge from GV Community Energy, captivated the audience with valuable insights into making homes more energy efficient and cost effective. The event was fully booked, with 51 attendees engaging in the one-hour presentation, followed by a dynamic 30 minute Q&A session that encouraged thoughtful questions from the audience. The evening concluded with light refreshments where attendees eagerly lined up to speak further with the guest speakers. Greater Shepparton City Council's Team Leader Sustainability and Environment, Paul Dainton, was pleased with the community's response to the event. \"We were very happy to see so many community members attend the event and engage with the speakers, taking advantage of these expert's knowledge,\" he said. \"They were able to learn some simple tips on how to reduce energy use, whilst also keeping their homes more comfortable during the depths of winter or height of summer.\" \"We received great feedback from those who attended and many inquired about future events similar to this one. We know the community want to reduce their household energy costs, so it is encouraging to know Greater Shepparton's residents are keen to learn more about home energy efficiency.\" Attendees heard about some of the benefits and options for upgrades such as solar panels, induction cooktops and heat pump hot water systems. There was also a strong focus on the importance of complete coverage of properly installed roof insulation, and covering of ducts and vents when not in use. Attendees learnt that even double glazed windows exposed to direct sunlight do not keep the heat out, so measures to shade windows during summer can reduce the need for cooling.
