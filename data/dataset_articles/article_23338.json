  "text": "Camp Verde in Yavapai County, Arizona — The American Mountains (Southwest)\nGrowing a Livelihood\nThe space where you have been walking was a small part of the farmland cultivated by the people of Montezuma Castle. Crops provided more than food - the economy of the Castle community may have been based largely on trade and craft specialization, including cotton weaving. Textiles were important for everyday use, trade, and ceremonies, so the demand for cotton was high.\nPeople also transplanted and cultivated agave to provide fibers for making strong twine used in ropes, nets, cords, bags, and sandals. Roasted agave hearts made a sweet food with calories equal to corn. Archeological sites in the valley yield abundant fiber cordage and numerous stone knives for harvesting and processing agave. The plant is still important to the Yavapai and Apache cultures, and is celebrated in modern agave harvests and roasts.\nCaptions\nThough the Castle is the most visible, this site is actually home to a larger group of dwellings, including Castle A and numerous\nArcheological excavations revealed shoes of agave fibers and leather at the site which were created by the Castle's prehistoric occupants.\nIntermountain Museum Services\nErected by Montezuma Castle National Monument.\nTopics.

National Park Service\nOn December 8, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt celebrated the passage of the Antiquities Act by declaring four sites of historic and cultural significance as our nation's first National Monuments. Among these was Montezuma Castle, which the President identified as a place \"of the greatest ethnological value and scientific interest.\" Although very few original artifacts remained in the structure due to intensive looting of the site, Roosevelt's decision assured the continued protection of one of the best preserved prehistoric cliff dwellings in North America.(Submitted on July 18, 2024, by James Hulse of Medina, Texas.)\nCredits.\n[This page was last] [revised](ChangeHistory.asp?m=251677)on July 18, 2024.
