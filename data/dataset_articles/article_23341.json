  "text": "Signs of life could survive near surfaces of Enceladus and Europa July 19, 2024 Imma Perfetto Cosmos science journalist\nBy Imma Perfetto Jupiter’s moon Europa and Saturn’s moon Enceladus probably harbour vast oceans under their icy crusts. Could life survive within them?\nA new NASA experiment suggests that, if these oceans support life, organic molecules like amino acids and nucleic acids could survive just under the ice’s surface.\nThe findings have implications for sampling depths and locations in future life detection missions to Europa and Enceladus.\nDramatic plumes, both large and small, spray water ice and vapor from many locations along the famed “tiger stripes” near the south pole of Saturn’s moon Enceladus. Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute “Based on our experiments, the ‘safe’ sampling depth for amino acids on Europa is … [about] 20cm at high latitudes of the trailing hemisphere (hemisphere opposite to the direction of Europa’s motion around Jupiter) in the area where the surface hasn’t been disturbed much by meteorite impacts,” says Alexander Pavlov of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in the US , lead author of the paper published in Astrobiology .\n“Subsurface sampling is not required for the detection of amino acids on Enceladus – these molecules will survive radiolysis (breakdown by radiation) at any location on the Enceladus surface less than … a few millimetres from the surface.”\nRadiation from space and high-speed particles in their planet’s magnetic fields bombard the surfaces of Europa and Enceladus, making it unlikely for life to survive there.\nHowever, their subsurface oceans – heated by tides caused by the gravitational pull of nearby moons and the host planet – could provide the necessary energy supply and elements and compounds necessary to create biological molecules.\nThese biomolecules could be brought to the surface by geysers or the churning motion of the ice crust.\nTo determine the rates at which amino acids would break down, (known as “radiolysis constants,”) researchers simulated the conditions on these icy worlds. They mixed amino acids with ice at about -196° C in sealed, airless vials and bombarded them with varying doses of gamma-rays.\nThis view of Jupiter’s icy moon Europa was captured by JunoCam, the public engagement camera aboard NASA’s Juno spacecraft, during the mission’s close flyby on Sept. 29, 2022. As with our Moon and Earth, one side of Europa always faces Jupiter, and that is the side of Europa visible here. Europa’s surface is crisscrossed by fractures, ridges, and bands, which have erased terrain older than about 90 million years. Citizen scientist Kevin M. Gill processed the images to enhance the color and contrast. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS Image processing: Kevin M. Gill CC BY 3.0 With this data they then used the age of the ice surface and the radiation environment at Europa and Enceladus to calculate the drilling depth and locations where 10% of the amino acids would survive radiolytic destruction.\nThe team found that amino acids degraded faster when mixed with silicate dust (simulating the potential mixing of material from meteorites) but degraded slower while still inside dead bacteria.\n“Slow rates of amino acid destruction in biological samples under Europa and Enceladus-like surface conditions bolster the case for future life-detection measurements by Europa and Enceladus lander missions,” says Pavlov.\n“Our results indicate that the rates of potential organic biomolecules’ degradation in silica-rich regions on both Europa and Enceladus are higher than in pure ice and, thus, possible future missions to Europa and Enceladus should be cautious in sampling silica-rich locations on both icy moons.”\nOriginally published by Cosmos as Signs of life could survive near surfaces of Enceladus and Europa",
