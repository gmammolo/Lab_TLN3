  "text": "Stuarts Draft Farm thankful for rainfall STUARTS DRAFT, Va. (WHSV) - Augusta County produce farm says the recent rain has been a blessing. Cassidy Fitzgerald, Co-owner of Simply Rooted Farm said the farm has not had much moisture and the rain that came has helped. Co-owner Madison Davis said there was only a little bit of wind damage. “Luckily, we didn’t have too much wind damage if any at all, it blew over some sunflowers and maybe a couple corn plants but nothing too harmful,” Davis said. Davis and Fitzgerald said the dry weather has not been good for fruit production or fruit health. Davis added that even the plants that prefer dryer weather were not getting enough moisture. ”We grow a ten-acre field by hand, and we have no way to irrigate so we are thankful for this now,” Davis said. While getting too much rain can cause damage to the crops, other than a few baby corn plants that were covered, the rain has caused more good than bad. Simply Rooted Farm’s main crop right now is sweet corn, which typically grows better with about an inch of rain per week, which it hasn’t been getting, Davis said. Copyright 2024 WHSV.
