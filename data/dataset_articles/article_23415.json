  "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — Based in Austin, the country's largest housing provider to unaccompanied migrant children is being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice, [accused of \"engaging in patterns\" of sexual abuse and harassment](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/housing-provider-for-migrant-children-engaged-in-sexual-abuse-and-harassment-doj-says) through its employees. For 20 years, Southwest Key has sheltered migrant children who have came to the United States alone and helped reunite them with family or a guardian. Funded with grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it has 29 child migrant shelters with 17 here in Texas. In total they can accommodate more than 6,000 children. \"Unaccompanied minors have zero social network, or a safety net, call it.\" Austin Immigration and Federal Litigation Attorney George Lobb said. \"They've got no social base, no one in the United States to protect them, and the only one that is supposed to is the government, and they failed in doing that by allowing southwest keys to watch over them.\" The Department of Justice alleges some employees - even supervisors - have engaged in rape, unwanted touching and the solicitation of sex and nude images of those children since at least 2015, with some victims as young as five. In one instance out of El Paso, an eight-year-old reported a Youth Care Worker \"repeatedly entered their bedrooms in the middle of the night to touch their 'private area,' and he threatened to kill their families if they disclosed the abuse.\" \"If you properly train staff, screen them and do ratios, you will, you will eliminate a lot of these issues and reduce suffering.\" Lobb said. \"It's impossible to completely eliminate this, and we know this, but there is a pattern and practice of Southwest Keys putting profit before people, and this is a disgusting culmination of that policy.\" The lawsuit says the children were threatened with violence against them and their families to ensure their silence, and in some cases, Southwest Key was even aware of the abuse but didn't report it. The lawsuit also describes employees acting as \"spotters\" while other employees committed the abuse. The D.O.J. alleges Southwest Key failed to take appropriate actions to protect the children in their care, a violation of the Fair Housing Act. [ALSO| ATX city council passes resolution requiring safety barriers at medical facilities](https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/atx-city-council-passes-resolution-requiring-safety-barriers-at-medical-facilities) \"If you have an FHA grant, or you're operating an FHA facility, you have to comply with all federal law, including you can't discriminate,\" Lobb said. \"And part of sex discrimination is sexual harassment, rape, child pornography - which is also listed in the lawsuit - among other things.\" In a statement to CBS Austin Thursday, Southwest Key says: Southwest Key Programs’ primary focus is the safety, health, and well-being of each one of the children and youth we care for. We continue to review the complaint, and it does not present the accurate picture of the care and commitment our employees provide to the youth and children. We are in constant communication and continue to closely partner with the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), as we have done so for the past two decades to ensure the children and youth entrusted to our care are safe with us during their short stay with Southwest Key. The D.O.J. is asking for an immediate stop to these discriminatory practices and action to prevent future abuse, reparations for the victims and civil penalties against Southwest Key. \"You take the most vulnerable people on the planet and stick them in a situation in which they are targets, ripe targets for abuse,\" Lobb said. \"We have the money to put people on busses and fly them around the country, but we're not spending money to protect kids.\" An anonymous hotline to report abuse is available on hhs.gov... or you can call the Justice Department at 1-833-591-0291 and Dial 2 for Spanish.",
