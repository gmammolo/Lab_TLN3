  "text": "United States-based lawyer, Chief Owolabi Salis, has hailed the Mrs. Remi Tinubu’s Smart Garden Initiative.\n The Ikorodu-born lawyer said the move is an auspicious prospect to transform agriculture.\n “The initiative came close to the content of my manifesto on agriculture in my campaigns for governorship in 2007 to 2019, on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Alliance for Democracy(AD)”, Salis noted.\n ‘My team and I worked out an operational methodology to ensure every arable land in Lagos State were converted to agricultural usage as part of a blue-print drawn towards self-sufficiency, in accordance…” he said.\nRelated News The social critic hailed Chief Afe Babalola, founder and of Afe Babalola University in Ado-Ekiti, who said he sourced his food from his farm.\n “This move by our First Lady shows she cares, and has the motherly empathy to feel for the poor, she also strives to contribute towards ameliorating their plight…”\n Silas urged the First Lady to to harmonise and integrate the states, local governments, and Ministry of Agriculture, to elevate the scheme to lift agriculture.",
