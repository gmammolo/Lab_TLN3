  "text": "As athletes go for gold, Paris Olympics organizers go for green\nCompetition is back in the City of Lights a century after Paris last hosted the Summer Games, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around.\nParis 2024 set an emissions target below 1.5 million tons of CO2, less than half the carbon footprint of the previous summer Olympics.\nTo do that, organizers secured 100% clean energy to power the games, generating electricity from windmills in Normandy and solar panels on venues.\n95% of Olympic venues are existing structures. In the two new venues built for aquatics and basketball, the seats are made of recycled plastic.\n\"All along the way people were saying 'this is too ambitious you're never going to make it,'\" said Georgina Grenon, the sustainability director for Paris 2024. \"If this Games can send a message that it's worth making an effort to reduce emissions, that it is possible. If this games manages to send this message across, then we all won a gold medal out of this.\"\nExpect more plant-based food options on menus, all locally sourced within 150 miles of the Paris.\nAthletes will sleep on cardboard beds and won’t be provided air conditioning. Instead, a pipe cooling system in the floorboards aim to keep housing between 73 and 79 degrees.\nTeam USA is opting to bring their own portable AC units, saying heat may be too much of a factor in the athletes' performance.\nSome roads will be shut down and public transit beefed up, with green taxis available. Paris planted 300,000 new trees to offset carbon emissions.\nCycling will be encouraged during the games, with 800 miles of new bike lanes added and 3,000 pay-as-you-go bikes for spectators to use.",
