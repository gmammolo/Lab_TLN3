  "text": "Hadley man arrested on firearms, ammunition charges after FBI searches home\nPublished: 04-09-2025 5:24 PM\n|\nHADLEY — FBI agents arrested a 43-year-old Hadley man on Wednesday at his home on charges of unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition following an extensive search of his residence the previous day, according to an FBI spokeswoman.\nBased on the criminal complaint, agents found six guns inside a locked safe and a box of 50 rounds of ammunition inside a bedside table at the home of Jacob D. Miller at 108 Hockanum Road.\nMiller, who was convicted in 2004 on charges of possession of explosive devices and possession of child pornography, was taken into custody for violating Title 18, Section 922(g)(1) of the U.S. code, which states that it is unlawful, due to a previous criminal conviction with a sentence of more than one year “to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce … any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.”\nWhen agents opened the safe on Tuesday, after getting a supplemental search warrant, they found a Remington Model 514; a J. Stevens Arms Company Single Gun; a Remington Sportsmaster Model 511; an O.F. Mossberg & Sons No. 44B; a Marlin Family Firearms Company; and a Remington Model 12C .22 rifle\nThe box of 50 rounds of Federal brand, American Eagle, .45 auto, 230 grain ammunition was determined to be ammunition that is not manufactured in Massachusetts, according to the FBI.\nMiller appeared in federal court in Springfield on Wednesday and was ordered released on conditions, including a special condition that he consent to allow the state Department of Environmental Protection to enter his residence and remove any hazardous materials. Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Breslow asked for this to occur as soon as possible.\nThe affidavit for the criminal complaint was filed by Special Agent Dustin Farivar, assigned to the Boston Division Springfield Resident Agency’s national security squad. The search on Tuesday was based on an affidavit by Special Agent Derek Boucher, sought on Saturday and granted by U.S Magistrate Judge Katherine A. Robertston.\nMiller on Feb. 9, 2004 was convicted on two counts of possession of explosive devices and possession of child pornography, with a Feb. 13, 2004 was sentenced to 2½ years in jail and 10 years probation for the weapons charges and seven years of probation for the child pornography possession charge. An extensive search of Miller’s home in December 2002 uncovered the weapons and was based on a U.S. Postal Service investigation.",
