(WFIE) - An Evansville nonprofit is looking to build a space where at-risk kids and teens can experience the great outdoors for free. Young and Established has plans to transform land on Evansville’s west side into a campground. All the land is already secured, and Indiana housing and community development authority has promised $50,000, but only if the community pitches in too. “I don’t want to say it’s a lost thing these days with the newer generation, but being outdoors is very important for mental health,” said executive director of Young and Established, Courtney Johnson. Johnson says many of their kids and teens aren’t getting these same experiences. “A lot of our students never had the opportunity to fish or to camp and to do those basic things that I got to do and I’m sure several others got to do growing up,” said Johnson. Johnson says they’re hoping to change that by building their very own campground in Evansville’s behind the westside Walmart. “There’s a chance for them to fish and be in a space that’s just calm and peaceful, those things we just sort of take for granted. But the clock on that dream is ticking. Young and Established only has until September 16 to raise 50,0000 to unlock a matching donation to fund the building of the new site. “I think this is going to be something very big for our community and our kids are already excited,” Johnson said. That’s because before being ready for bonfires and dips in the lake, the land Young and Established has purchased needs a lot of work. “It’s really an old cabin,” Johnson said. “I mean it’s been around for a very long time.” Years of cobwebs and overgrowth have taken over the space. “We need to fix the cabin up, we obviously need to fix the deck and make sure the lake is safe. There’s just a bunch of things that need a little bit of work out there,” Johnson explained. Even in its disheveled state, Johnson says the kids at Young and Established see nothing but potential. “We showed a few of our kids the property just to see their excitement, and they were like, this is ours,” said Johnson. “Yeah, this is something we’re going to be able to have forever,” Young and Establish has 60 days starting Thursday to raise $50,000 to unlock a matching donation to clean this place up.
