  "text": "Technologies, 2024 Technologies, 2024 EINPresswire.com / -- FLOWBOX , a pioneer in advanced energy management and optimization systems, announced its inclusion in the prestigious Gartner® Hype Cycle™ for Low-Carbon Energy Technologies, 2024. According to FLOWBOX, this recognition highlights the company's innovative contributions to the energy sector, particularly in the category of Energy Management and Optimization Systems (EMOS). Gartner Hype Cycles provide a graphic representation of the maturity and adoption of technologies and applications, and how they are potentially relevant to solving real business problems and exploiting new opportunities. Gartner Hype Cycle methodology gives you a view of how a technology or application will evolve over time, providing a sound source of insight to manage its deployment within the context of your specific business goals.* According to Gartner research, realizing ambitious emissions reduction goals while maintaining growth relies on the widespread adoption of low-carbon energy technologies. This Hype Cycle shows the current state of key low-carbon energy technologies to help executive leaders track technology maturity, associated impacts and risks. FLOWBOX is recognized in the category of EMOS, highlighting its status as a rapidly expanding technology. As per the Gartner report, drivers under Energy Management and Optimization Systems state: - “The launch of COP28 Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge on 2 December 2023 set global targets to double the rate of global energy efficiency improvements from roughly 2% to an annual figure of 4% by 2030.” - “Increased investments in smart grids and meters facilitate connection and coordination of enterprise equipment, enabling advancements in EMOS capabilities.” - “Advancements in technologies like digital twins and AI enable bidirectional coordination and automation, previously unfeasible but now viable due to rising energy prices.” Pavel Jiránek, COO of FLOWBOX: \"We are thrilled to be recognized in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Low-Carbon Energy Technologies, 2024. In our opinion, this acknowledgment validates our commitment to empowering commercial and industrial users with cutting-edge energy management solutions. Our platform offers advanced analytics and technology capabilities to optimize energy consumption, reduce costs and CO2 emissions, and thus enhance overall sustainability. As energy cost volatility and supply concerns continue to challenge businesses, our solutions are more crucial than ever in helping organizations achieve their net-zero goals and optimized operations.\" Energy Management and Optimization Systems FLOWBOX EMOS is designed to help commercial and industrial users manage their energy consumption efficiently.
