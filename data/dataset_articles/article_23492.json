  "text": "Recently, the Union Cabinet approved 1 GW offshore wind energy projects in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu with a total outlay of Rs 7,453 crore. The aim is to produce 3.72 billion units of renewable electricity annually and reduce 2.98 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emission annually for 25 years, according to the government. This comes at a time when globally, offshore wind energy projects have been struggling with rising costs of equipment and supply chain procurement. But the global woes may not impact the government’s plans, says Shirish S Garud, Consultant, T.E.R.I (The Energy and Research Institute). In an interaction with ET Digital, he explains how the wind energy industry has gradually evolved in the country and the trajectory it is taking now. Edited excerpt: ET: How has wind energy development evolved over the years?SG: The wind energy development in India started in the early 1980s when the government asked PSUs like BHEL to invest in these projects. In 1993, the government came out with a policy on the tariff of wind power plants that are to be connected to the grid. This was a proactive one that gave some fixed tariff and annual increment in this tariff. This policy continued till 2003, during which the wind energy sector grew very fast. Private players came into the picture — like Suzlon and RRB Wind who started manufacturing wind machines in India. It was, in fact, much cheaper than solar at about Rs 6 per kilowatt compared to Rs 17-18 per kilowatt for solar. There was 100% depreciation in income tax for industries and individuals in this sector. So many industries, as well as individuals like film stars, cricketers, started investing in this segment. These developments happened mostly in windy states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and to a certain extent in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana. But the tax depreciation was later reduced to 80%; it has been reduced further now.ET: So how is the sector placed now?SG: India has about 46 gigawatt of wind power installed capacity, and this is all onshore wind. India started looking at offshore wind quite late. But we do have a nearly 7000-km coastline with a potential of 300 gigawatt of offshore wind capacity. This is an ambitious plan which will contribute to the net-zero 2070 target, producing 500 gigawatt of renewable energy. ET: Globally, offshore wind projects have been struggling. There are also supply chain procurement and compliance issues with the US and Europe. Do you think India will also face those issues?SG: The problems in the US are a bit US-specific problems actually. One reason I know is if you want to go to a US port, it has to be a US-owned vessel (Ships transporting goods between two US ports must be an American-owned ship). Now, all the vessels in the offshore wind industry are typically European-owned. Before Covid-19, they managed for some time but now they are finding it difficult because of the costs and logistics issues. US companies are building a vessel, but that will take time because it is a big investment.Many of the offshore wind projects were approved before Covid. After the gap of two years, there was a lull in business, which impacted the market as the interest rates increased in the European and American markets. This plus an increase in prices of raw materials have made the industry over there realise that the pre-Covid rates are no longer viable for new wind projects. Some have decided not to go ahead with their pre-approved plans.But I am hopeful that we will not have many of these issues because the government is proactive. And the supply industry is also looking for projects because there is a wind turbine manufacturing industry, there is an allied industry of installations, maintenance, etc, and they are eagerly looking for new projects. ET: What should be done to push the government’s wind energy project agenda?SG: Based on the data and investigations by the National Institute of Wind Energy, the government has started activities to go in for installation of one gigawatt offshore wind capacity. Now, offshore wind needs some special developments in the allied industries — like you need to carry the wind blades to the site that can be a few km out at sea. This will require special port facilities as these blades are 100 plus metres long. They need to be carried on a special vessel and need a special type of maintenance — trained technicians who can do maintenance through helicopter because they have to land on a wind turbine that is maybe 120-150 metres above the seawater level. So, the government has now decided to develop one gigawatt capacity sites — 500 megawatt each on the Tamil Nadu and Gujarat seashore. And they will also develop the port facilities for this. The government has come out with this funding plan for Rs 7,453 crore. One thing you should note is that when power is generated, it would cost Rs 6 a unit or so. But the discoms today are buying at between Rs 2 and Rs 3 a unit. So that Rs 4 or so needs to be compensated through viability gap funding.ET: What kind of geographic advantage does India have for wind energy projects?SG: The idea of offshore wind is you install turbines in the sea where it is not too deep and in an area where there are no obstructions for wind like buildings, trees or hills. A big benefit of offshore wind energy is that you can have large capacity machines, compared to onshore. Initially, small wind machines were developed for onshore applications — like 10-50 kilowatt, but they produce 2-4 megawatt of energy. They were also huge — about 110-120 metres. However, in offshore wind projects, wind turbines of higher capacity were designed. Now wind turbines with a capacity of more than 10 megawatts are getting installed. Globally also it has started developing in a big way as compared to solar or others.Unlike solar, wind is quite site-specific. There are 8-10 windy states in India, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra-belt, Odisha, Rajasthan and Gujarat. However, there are some constraints, because some of these sites fall in biodiversity sensitive areas, like the Western Ghats.The second aspect is that as far as the windy locations are concerned, most of them are today occupied by old machines that are smaller and not generating a good amount of energy. The government is trying to bring in a repowering scheme. But most of these are privately-owned and the owners are happy because they have got their investments back.Further, wind and solar complement each other mainly because wind is during monsoon season and during nights when solar is not much available. The government is trying to promote solar and wind hybrid power plants with storage capacity so that round-the-clock power can be supplied through this hybridisation of solar, wind and battery.",
