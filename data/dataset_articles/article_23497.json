  "text": "The ILRI-UQ Alliance signifies a significant step towards a more sustainable, climate-resilient future for livestock-based food systems. Leading representatives from the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( [CGIAR](https://www.cgiar.org/research/action-areas/)), the International Livestock Research Institute ( [ILRI](https://www.ilri.org/about-us)), and The University of Queensland (UQ) met this week to solidify a ground-breaking research alliance focused on transforming livestock food systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa and Asia. This strategic partnership, which builds on an Memorandum of Understanding signed between UQ and the CGIAR in late 2022, pairs UQ's position as Australia's top-ranked agricultural university with ILRI's decades of experience in livestock research for development. This alliance signifies a significant step towards a more sustainable, climate-resilient future for livestock-based food systems. By building research capacity, fostering innovation, and empowering local communities, this collaboration can improve the lives of millions around the world facing common climate resilience challenges. Lindiwe Majele Sibanda, Chair, CGIAR System Board, stated, “We proudly commit to partnering with UQ to work together to deliver on the CGIAR strategy of transforming food, land and water systems in a climate crisis,\" UQ: A Global Leader in Tropical Agriculture As one of the world’s leading universities for agriculture, and one of the few research-intensive universities globally located in a subtropical environment, UQ is perfectly positioned for this leadership role. UQ's expertise in tropical and sub-tropical agriculture, consistently ranked among the best in the world, combined with ILRI's established network in the Indo-Pacific, creates a powerful constructive collaboration. This will empower national partners in the region through capacity building and knowledge sharing. Appolinaire Djikeng, Director General, ILRI advises, \"We are excited to establish this research alliance between ILRI and UQ as it aligns to major new programs being established including investments by several donors to deliver climate solutions for livestock systems of the global south and the new CGIAR research program on sustainable animal and aquatic food systems, which will start in 2025,” Building the Next Generation of Food System Champions A cornerstone of the alliance is the development of a fellowship and graduate certificate program. This program will equip national program staff in LMICs in Asia and Africa with the latest research methodologies, best practices, and curriculum development skills. Additionally, a large-scale PhD program with co-supervision between UQ, ILRI, and local universities in these countries will nurture the next generation of livestock research scientists in these regions. Mr Brett Lovegrove, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Global Partnerships) at UQ advised, \"Global engagement and support for developing countries is central to UQ's mission and our vision of 'knowledge leadership for a better world' and, “Through our co-investment in this strategic alliance, we look forward to undertaking new education and research initiatives that will have enormous international impact and improve the climate resilience of our critical livestock food systems that underpin the livelihoods of 1.7 billion people worldwide.\" Impact Beyond Borders The ILRI-UQ alliance extends its reach beyond research and education. By aligning existing initiatives and co-designing new research projects, the alliance aims to accelerate the transition towards climate-resilient food systems. This collaborative effort will not only benefit South East Asia and East Africa but will also contribute to Australia's domestic agricultural advancements and biosecurity measures, particularly in north tropical Queensland and regional communities.
