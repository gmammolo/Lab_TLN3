  "text": "States » NorthPosted at: Jul 19 2024 11:17AM Sweet success: Kashmiri farmer's watermelon dream bears fruitSrinagar, July 19 (UNI) In the picturesque village of Wantarak Chak, six km from Mattan in south Kashmir's Anantnag district, a 45-year-old farmer, Mohammad Aslam Khan, has turned his long-cherished dream into a reality as he has successfully grown hybrid watermelons on a commercial scale, attracting a lot of attention and admiration. Khan's journey began in 2008 when he started growing watermelons on a small plot of land on a trial basis. Encouraged by the good crop and financial benefits, he gradually increased the plantation area to 16 kanals. Today, his watermelons are in high demand, and other farmers in the village have also started growing them on over 80 kanals of land. What sets Khan's watermelons apart is their unique taste, color, and size. “They are sweeter, fully red, and can weigh up to 20 kgs. Although the current crop is slightly smaller, weighing around 13 kgs, I am confident that the size will increase with time,” Khan said. The Agriculture Department has played a significant role in Khan's success, providing him with a hi-tech poly house for preparing nursery and hybrid seeds. The department's support has not only benefited Khan but also other farmers in the area who are now keen to grow watermelons. According to Chief Agriculture Officer Anantnag Aijaz Hussain Dar, this is the first time that watermelons have been grown on a commercial basis in the district. He believes that if more farmers take up this crop, Kashmiri watermelons could be exported to other parts of the country at good rates, given their unique taste and availability during the off-season. “This sweet and juicy fruit is not available anywhere else in India during the July-August period, making it a unique offering from the region. If we can increase the output and more farmers join in, we'll soon be exporting our watermelons to other parts of the country at attractive rates,\" he said. As the demand for his produce continues to grow, Khan says he remains committed to providing high-quality watermelons to his customers, ensuring that his dream bears fruit for years to come.
