  "text": "- The Cherab Community Conservancy Offices have been established courtesy of the French Development Agency (AFD) through the Northern Rangelands Trust. - The leaders hailed the positive impact brought about in the region since the establishment of the community conservancy in the year 2021 Leaders have called for continued collaboration to support pastoralist communities to scale up environmental and wildlife conservation efforts. This is in a bid to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change. Speaking during the opening of the new Cherab Community Conservancy Offices at Korbesa in Isiolo, French Ambassador Arnaud Suquet and Isiolo Governor Abdi Guyo emphasised the need for partnerships. “Community Conservancies play a key role in environmental conservation, security and uplifting livelihoods through initiatives like Ujuzi Manyattani,” Guyo said on Wednesday. State and non-state actors should partner to boost the capacity of local pastoralist communities to embark on sustainable environmental conservation programmes. This, they said, will enhance conservation measures and boost the fight against climate change. The Cherab Offices was established courtesy of the French Development Agency through the Northern Rangelands Trust. The leaders hailed the positive impact brought about in the region since the establishment of the community conservancy in the year 2021. Notable achievements have been realised, including the elimination of the poaching menace, enhancing proper grazing patterns and planting trees to save the land from degradation. The governor called for continued support to conservation efforts through the community conservancy model. “I urge the people of Isiolo to support conservation efforts to combat climate change and assure them that the community land registration process is firmly on track,” the county chief added. \"I want to say thank you to the French Development Agency (AFD) and the Northern Rangelands Trust for their support. We will continue to strengthen our partnership for the benefit of Isiolo.\" He assured the locals that the process of community land registration was firmly on track, to alleviate fears that they could lose their grazing lands to foreign entities in the guise of conservancies. \"Land registration and issuance of title deeds remains my priority number one as I pledged during the last general election,\" Guyo said.",
