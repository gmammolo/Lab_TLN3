  "text": "Electricity giant SSE said it generated nearly two-thirds more renewable energy Electricity giant SSE has reported a surge in renewable energy generation, with figures soaring by nearly two-thirds in the early summer months compared to last year. The London-listed company revealed that its renewables division&#039;s output was up by 60% in the three months leading up to June 30, attributing the boost to favourable weather and increased capacity. SSE announced that green generation rocketed to 2,596 GWh, citing &quot;a return to more normalised weather conditions over the period, in addition to year-on-year capacity increases&quot;. Meanwhile, gas-fired generation dipped by 10% to 3,714 GWh, as noted in the company&#039;s trading statement before its annual general meeting on Thursday. SSE confirmed that its first quarter financials were on target, aligning with its £20.5billion investment plan set for the next five years, with renewables securing over a third of this investment. The firm is aiming for nine gigawatts of installed capacity by 2026/27, mainly through offshore wind farm ventures. Barry O&#039;Regan, SSE&#039;s chief financial officer, said: &quot;We have made a solid start to the financial year as we convert our premium project pipeline into high-quality sustainable earnings.&quot; &quot;We remain on track to meet our 2027 growth targets that are underpinned by world-class assets and balance sheet strength, with two-thirds of revenue either regulated or already backed by existing government policy.&quot; &quot;The outlook is supported by the enhanced clean power target of the new UK Government, which recognises the essential need for investment in renewables, flexible power and electricity networks areas where SSE has unrivalled capability and significant growth potential.&quot;",
