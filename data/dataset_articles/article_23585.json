  "text": "Ms. Cooley has driven innovations that bring about transformational changes in Clean Energy and the Transportation sectors.\nHOUSTON, TX, July 19, 2024 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Maryam Cooley has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected based on current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\nWith a strong focus on Climate change inventions, accelerating the transition to a low-carbon future, Ms. Cooley has driven innovations that bring about transformational changes in Clean Energy and the Transportation sectors. As the founder and chief executive officer of Cooley Enterprises LLC, a holding company primarily focused on innovations related to solutions to Climate Change challenges by transforming the current modes of transportation, in response to consumers, being faced with ongoing higher fuel costs, labor shortages, and delays due to extreme weather calamities.\nThe Clean Energy Integrated Transportation System's methodologies are aimed to be operationally carbon-neutral by propelling the transportation pods through a network of transportation tubes that can be partially or entirely sub-surface, operating 24/7. As such, the transportation systems are a major re-orientation of the existing systems that are disruptive to create better modes of delivery that would be \"weather-immune\" to withstand the floods, fires, tornados, and freezes that continue to paralyze most, if not all, forms of transportation impacting millions of human lives and disrupting businesses.\nThe Clean Energy System can be fueled partially or entirely by solar, wind, hydrogen, geo-thermal, hydropower, natural gas, and other forms of renewables. This system aims to minimize dependency on batteries by using cable, track and cable, or hydro to propel pods, with similar sizes and speed ranges to trucks, but with zero emissions, lowering costs in operations. In certain regions of the country or the world, existing infrastructures can be re-used with some modest retrofitting.\nSome of her other notable inventions include Smart Display Sheet for vehicles and wheels; Smart Block; Turbine/Solar Power Extending the life of a Battery in EV or Hybrid vehicles; Air Shield Protection against Smoke from fires or explosions; and eWalls.\nOutside of her work at Cooley Enterprises, Ms. Cooley has served as the chief executive officer of Telos Resources LLC, a role she has held since 2010. Her career began in Houston while attending graduate school when she worked at Maintenance Engineering Corp, a provider of ion exchange resin to refineries and petrochemical plants along various shipping channels and throughout the United States. She later joined Buckman Laboratories, with headquarters in Memphis, TN, where she helped establish a direct market for their products. At Buckman, she faced challenges but overcame them by devising innovative solutions to complex problems. Notably, she was granted a patent for a multi-phased chemical treatment to prevent fouling in reverse osmosis-type membranes. This innovation now belongs to GE and Buckman due to subsequent acquisitions.\nAfter earning a Bachelor of Science in biology and chemistry from Sul Ross State University, Ms. Cooley continued her graduate work studies at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. These educational and work-related accomplishments have provided her with a strong foundation in scientific research, creativity and problem-solving skills that have been instrumental in her professional journey. In accounting for her overall success, she largely credits her innate drive and ambition to make a difference. She is passionate about finding solutions to problems and improving lives through her innovative ideas.\nIn addition to her professional achievements, Ms. Cooley has been recognized as a finalist for the Reuters Global Energy Transition Award in 2024 and was nominated for Startup of the Year. She has also been invited to participate in S&P Global Platts Award in 2024. She holds multiple patents and patent-pending applications related to clean energy transportation systems, including various tracks and cables, hydro systems; turbines, and solar applications on vehicles.\nOutside of her professional life, Ms. Cooley values maintaining a balance between her career aspirations and personal life.\nAbout Marquis Who's Who®:\nSince 1899, when A.
