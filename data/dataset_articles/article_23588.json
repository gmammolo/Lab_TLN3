  "text": "Description The slow-flowing Ipswich River is a magical place to view wetland breeding birds. We'll meander up and down the river making frequent stops to look and listen for Virgina Rail, Sora, Yellow-throated Vireo, Great-crested Flycatcher, and many other species that raise their young in nests and tree cavities along the river. The canoes will allow us to venture deep into the freshwater marsh for a peaceful experience that combines birdwatching and boating. Checking registration status.
