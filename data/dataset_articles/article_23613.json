  "text": "A young osprey discovered by an area photographer has gotten a second chance in the wild after its mother was found to be dead in the nest in Gauley Bridge. Photographer Kim Ayers notified Three Rivers Avian Center (TRAC) on June 7 that a female osprey appeared to be dead in the nest on top of the railroad trestle at Gauley Bridge, Executive Director of Three River Avian Center Wendy Perrone. ”We would not be able to get there before dark, so we started working the phones to find a volunteer who was closer. Matt Carpenter, an experienced climber, volunteered to come from Fayetteville and rescue the chicks,” Perrone said. Carpenter and two friends, Lindsay Hermanns, a wildlife biologist, and Amber Jaxon joined in the rescue effort. The chicks were rescued by 8:30 p.m., that evening. The mother osprey had evidently been dead for a few days. Kim Ayers joined Carpenter and his friends to meet Perrone and Three Rivers Avian Center’s Education Director Ron Perrone at 9:30 p.m., in Beckley, and the chicks were brought to TRAC. Perrone said the chicks spent their time there being fed donated culled fish from the WV DNR’s Tate Lohr Fish Hatchery in Oakvale. ”Once they were old enough to eat on their own, they were moved to the Leon Wilson Flyway in TRAC’s Flight Barn. One chick was not as strong as the other and ended up passing away in early July. The remaining chick has thrived and was ready to return to his hatch area near the railroad trestle in Gauley Bridge Thursday afternoon,” Perrone said. There are still osprey coming to the nest site, so we are hopeful that they will show the young osprey how to catch his own fish. Osprey are mostly fish eaters, and are known for their dramatic plunges into water to catch their food. Osprey have gradually been increasing in numbers in West Virginia, and can now be found along major waterways throughout the state. An investigation is underway by the WV Division Of Natural Resources police into the cause of the mother osprey’s death, Perrone said.",
