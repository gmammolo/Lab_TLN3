  "text": "Researchers have figured out how to grow tomatoes that consume less water without compromising the yield, quality, or taste, Phys.org [reported](https://phys.org/news/2024-01-crispr-technology-succeed-tomatoes-consume.html). The researchers used something called CRISPR [technology](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/) to genetically alter the tomato plants to be able to grow them more efficiently. Their findings were [published](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2309006120) in the scientific journal PNAS. … To create tomatoes that required less water — especially important in the face of increasingly [frequent and intense droughts](https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/drought-resistant-grains-morocco-icarda/) — the scientists removed a gene called ROP9, which functions as a switch that toggles the plants between an active and inactive state. By removing that switch, the tomato plants’ stomata remained partially closed during the day, allowing them to retain more water. “There is great similarity between the ROP9 in tomatoes and ROP proteins found in other crop plants such as pepper, eggplant, and wheat. Therefore, the discoveries detailed in our article could form the basis for the development of additional crop plants with enhanced water use efficiency, and for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind stomatal opening and closing,” [said](https://phys.org/news/2024-01-crispr-technology-succeed-tomatoes-consume.html#google_vignette) Dr. Nir Sade, one of the researchers.",
