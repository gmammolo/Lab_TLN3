It optimally connects the supply of, and demand for, renewable energy for everything from heating and lighting to elevators and office equipment, in addition to electrifying the mobility hub, which will be used to charge electric vehicles from across the Stadtwerke Stuttgart fleet.\nThis intelligent combination of digital applications and renewable energy supply will\nSiemens AG\nWerner-von-Siemens-Strasse 1\nCommunications\n80333 Munich\nHead: Lynette Jackson\nGermany\nReference number: HQSIPR202407166965EN\nPage 1/3\nSiemens AG\nPress Release\nalso be utilized at other Stadtwerke Stuttgart projects, including its hydrogen production facility in the city's port. This will serve as a further showcase for other businesses looking to maximize sector coupling to deliver more cost effective, energy efficient and therefore sustainable operations.\n\"The combination of Siemens expertise in building management and ours in the energy industry creates solutions that not only help us to achieve our own sustainability goals but also help us to support other organizations in their energy transition\" said Peter Drausnigg, Technical Managing Director at Stadtwerke Stuttgart. \"We see ourselves as the driving force behind the energy transition in Stuttgart and are proud to be working with Siemens to set an example for other businesses and cities to follow around the world.\"\nAt the heart of the building management system from Siemens is intelligent Digital Twin technology. Siemens Smart Infrastructure Building X 360° Viewer and Energy Manager offer digital representations of the headquarters, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) insights to retrieve and process relevant real time data from installed building and e-mobility technology. Building X is a digital building platform that supports customers to digitalize, manage, and optimize their building operations.\nFrom Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for lighting control to fire protection and security applications, such insights will help to achieve energy savings of up to 30 percent. Such insights enable 24/7 transparency of live and historical events and generate up to 10 percent more net operating income. In the mobility hub for example, electric vehicle charging is optimized to maximize available renewable energy and by using intelligent insights on working patterns, charging is guaranteed to be complete for when each employee finishes work.\nMatthias Rebellius, Managing Board Member of Siemens AG and CEO of Smart Infrastructure added: \"We are delighted to be working in partnership with Stadtwerke Stuttgart to show how we can combine the real and the digital worlds to drive genuine sustainable transformation.\n\"Intelligent building and energy management optimizes the use of renewable energy sources, maximizing efficient operations while minimizing impact on the energy grid.\nReference number: HQSIPR202407166965EN\nPage 2/3\nSiemens AG\nPress Release\nThis is setting a new standard not only in Stuttgart but for cities across the world which are facing the challenge of making both new and existing buildings fit for purpose as we collectively transition towards a more sustainable future.\"\nThis press release as well as press pictures are available here .\nFor more information on Siemens Smart Infrastructure, please see Siemens Smart Infrastructure .\nFollow us on X at: www.x.com/siemens_press , www.x.com/siemensinfra\nContact for journalists:\nSiemens Smart Infrastructure\nNatalie Hodges\nPhone: +44 780 882 6229; email: natalie.hodges.ext@siemens.com\nSiemens Smart Infrastructure (SI) is shaping the market for intelligent, adaptive infrastructure for today and the future.
