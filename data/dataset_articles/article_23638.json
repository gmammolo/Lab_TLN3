  "text": "In a significant step to increase greenery in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has initiated a large-scale plantation drive along the state’s expressways. As part of this effort, more than 2,00,000 saplings will be planted along four major expressways. Additionally, 100,000 saplings will be planted in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor. The Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) is spearheading this initiative. The Yogi government is also preparing for extensive tree planting along the banks of the under-construction Ganga Expressway. This year, continuing the tradition of past years, more than 36 crore saplings will be planted under the ‘Ped Lagao, Ped Bachao Abhiyan’. According to UPEIDA officials, a budget of over Rs 36 crore is being provided to the Uttar Pradesh Forest department for planting trees on 500 hectares on both sides between the carriageway and service road of the Ganga Expressway, and for their maintenance over the next 10 years. Additionally, as part of the campaign, more than 2,37,000 saplings will be planted on four other expressways managed by UPEIDA. This includes 15,000 saplings on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, 1,06,000 on Purvanchal Expressway, 25,000 on Bundelkhand Expressway, and 91,600 on Gorakhpur Link Expressway. Furthermore, 1,00,000 plants will be planted in the UP Defence Industrial Corridor. These will include 66,700 saplings of peepal, pakad, banyan, gular, and neem trees, along with a large number of fruit-bearing trees. Under the Ganga Expressway Project, UPEIDA is providing over Rs 16 crore to the Forest department for the Ganga River Dolphin Conservation Plan. Additionally, UPEIDA is giving Rs 5 crore to the Forest department for the revival of the Mala river and the conservation of biodiversity in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve.",
