  "text": "( MENAFN - The Conversation) When climate change leads the news, it's often down to a hurricane, heatwave or flood. And, judging by our most widely read environment stories over the past decade, extreme weather really is one of the main ways the public (or at least our readers) learns about climate breakdown.\nThis roundup of The Conversation's climate coverage comes from our weekly climate action newsletter . Every Wednesday, The Conversation's environment editor writes Imagine, a short email that goes a little deeper into just one climate issue. Join the 30,000+ readers who've subscribed.\nThe movie Twisters is released this week, a remake of the 1996 film with an added“s”. Simon Dickinson of the University of Plymouth says the fact Hollywood commissioned a remake is further evidence that“people are fascinated by extreme weather and the devastation it can cause”.\nDickinson explains there is a deep underlying psychology behind this, beyond people simply wanting to see stuff crash and burn. For him, people are interested in extreme weather and watch movies and videos of hurricanes, tornadoes and so on,“because they connect us to people, places and ideas. Sometimes, this is about being able to visualise concepts we've heard about but never seen with our own eyes.”\nRead more: Twisters follows a superstar storm chaser – obsession with extreme weather has a deep underlying psychology\nHe recently conducted a study examining why people were watching live footage of hurricanes and storms on YouTube:\nThis will feels familiar to anyone who, like me, has been down a tornado rabbit hole on YouTube to see what the fastest winds on Earth might actually involve. (Check out this particularly harrowing video of a father and daughter surviving a twister in their shelter in Illinois, then emerging outside just 90 seconds later to find their neighbourhood in ruins ).\nSurviving an F4 tornado in Washington, Illinois. Climate change is, of course, the main concept that extreme weather helps people visualise. None of us can“see” 1°C of warming, but we can all watch small islands being flattened or homes being flooded.\nIn the big picture, it's safe to say a warmer world means more extreme weather. But that“does not mean all extreme weather events are being made stronger or more frequent”, says Friederike Otto, a climate scientist and co-founder of the World Weather Attribution project, which investigates to what extent climate change has influenced particular episodes of extreme weather. In 2020, she described how scientists were increasingly able to provide climate–weather attribution within the news cycle .\nThese“rapid attribution studies” are important, she writes,“as they provide scientific evidence while the event is still in the news and everyone is still paying attention – not months later after the academic peer-review process.”\nRead more: Yes, climate change can affect extreme weather – but there is still a lot to learn\nAll this means we can state the links between a given hurricane or heatwave and climate change with more certainty than ever. So are these extreme weather“events” a useful moment to talk about climate change?\nLinked to climate change? We no longer have to wait years to find out. victor yankee / shutterstock Joshua Ettinger, a climate communication expert at the University of Oxford, researches how extreme weather can reduce the“psychological distance” associated with climate change.“While climate change can feel abstract and vague,” he writes ,“extreme weather is something people can experience firsthand.”\nPeople won't necessarily draw a link between the two, however. Ettinger says that research offers“contrasting results”:\nBut you can make a difference, says Ettinger. He points out that simply talking about climate change is a good way to inspire climate action, and that extreme weather – whether seen on TV or experienced first-hand – provides a useful conversation starter.“We can use these moments as opportunities to engage our families, friends and communities in discussions about how climate change may relate to these events, and what we can do about it.”\nHe notes a few guidelines for these discussions. When talking to someone about a hurricane, heatwave or flood,“affirm the validity of their emotional response – whether they are afraid, angry, hopeful or worried. There is no one right way to feel about climate change, so listen to what they have to say and then share your own perspective too.”\nYou might be accused of“politicising” the weather. Ettinger suggests how you can (respectfully) push back against this claim:\nRead more: Extreme weather events are exactly the time to talk about climate change – here's why\nOutside of work, I try not to rant about climate change too much, and instead gently guide things in that direction. Perhaps you do something similar. These are tough but worthwhile conversations.\nDickinson, writing about Twisters, says the big challenge for scientists is to“harness this fascination in a way that stimulates knowledge and behavioural change beyond the small window of the event itself”. Hopefully, this newsletter has helped in that regard.\nMENAFN19072024000199003603ID1108458056",
