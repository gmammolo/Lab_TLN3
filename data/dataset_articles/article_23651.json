(CBCP News) SPONSORED ARTICLES How logistics industry experts plan to ‘move forward’ after COVID-19 Reasons why Filipinos love Korean culture and products Why Batangas is the destination for budget-friendly family holidays Philippines’ Catholic bishops are supporting a renewable energy campaign to install 10 million solar rooftops across the country.\nThe Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) endorsed the “10 Million Solar Rooftop Challenge” in the hope of a clean energy-powered future.\nThis was announced by Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, CBCP president, after their recent plenary assembly in Cagayan de Oro City.\nThe ambitious and multisectoral project aims to install solar panels on household rooftops nationwide to reduce carbon emissions.\nCaritas Philippines said the campaign “aligns with the Church’s mission to care for creation and promote sustainable development.\nIt said the initiative aligns with the goals of Laudato Si’, Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment, which calls for swift action to protect the planet.\n“We implore all Filipinos, especially parishes and church-based organizations, to actively participate in this challenge by investing in solar power and advocating for its benefits within their communities,” the national Caritas said.\nAs part of their commitment to the challenge, Caritas will install solar panels in remote areas without electricity so they can also benefit from renewable energy.\nThe Church’s social action and advocacy arm said it will also continue its transition to renewable energy to set an example and inspire others.\n“Together, we can forge a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future for all,” it added.\nInteraksyon TAGS solar rooftop Share Facebook Twitter CBCP News",
