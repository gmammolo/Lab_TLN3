  "text": "July 16 is World Snake Day.\nThe day is observed annually to raise awareness of the wide variety of species around the world.\nThe Benoni City Times caught up with Christopher Mthombeni (44), a snake catcher who worked for the Ekurhuleni municipality.\nMthombeni said he has been wrangling these fascinating creatures for the past 22 years.\nChristopher Mthombeni hopes events like World Snake Day will change the public perception of these cold-blooded reptiles. The 44-year-old’s passion for snakes began while he was still a teenager while exploring the outdoors with the Scouts and Girls Guide Association.\n“I fell in love with nature. After finishing school I pursued a nature conservation course,” he said.\nMthombeni said some of the snakes that are commonly found in Ekurhuleni include rinkhals, puff adder, skaapsteker and herald snake.\nThe snake catcher said to be able to differentiate between venomous and non-venomous snakes people must consider diving into books, watching shows, or even visiting zoos.\nChristopher Mthombeni rescues a snake. “Understanding these species is crucial, especially due to urban developments and illegal dumping spaces that create new habitats for them.\n“Snakes are usually more scared of humans than we are of them, however, don’t underestimate them because they can defend themselves if provoked.\n“One of the misconceptions about snakes is the idea that the only good snake is a dead snake. Snakes play a vital role in our ecosystem by controlling pests.”\nMthombeni advises people to stay calm, keep their distance and call a professional snake catcher when they encounter a snake.\n“Never try to handle or kill it,” he warns.\nMthombeni’s message for World Snake Day is to “respect, observe, and appreciate these remarkable creatures.”\nAlso Read: SNAKE ROAD: Roads department grappling with options\nAlso Read: Watch: Chameleon bites venomous snake",
