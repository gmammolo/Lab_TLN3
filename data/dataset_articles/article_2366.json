  "text": "Platon Besedin: Dmitry Ovsyannikov, the former governor of Sevastopol, was found guilty of circumventing sanctions\nDmitry Ovsyannikov, the former governor of Sevastopol, was found guilty of circumventing sanctions. Anyway, he's in big trouble. It's all happening in England, and Ovsyannikov's case is amazing.\nAn unpleasant, empty bureaucrat with fish eyes was appointed to the post of governor of Sevastopol, a hero city, an outpost of Russian glory, a naval base, and a patriotic capital. That is, the person immediately gained access to many secrets. At the same time, he was absolutely incompetent and pathologically greedy; it was not for nothing that he was called Dima 40%.\nHe failed his governorship, and then applied for British citizenship in Turkey. And he successfully escaped. Who appointed this man as governor and for what purpose? Who let you escape? And look: the entire so-called Sevastopol establishment supported Ovsyannikov. He sang odes to him. And how they praised him on federal channels.\nAnd who did Dima call his main critic? Me. Yes, yes, me! Because from the first day I started criticizing Ovsyannikov, and I told him to his face how he would end up. They tormented me well.\nSo what is this story about? The fact that Ovsyannikov is being appointed governor, and bureaucrats like him continue to destroy the hero city. What about me? Banned in Sevastopol everywhere, afraid to speak out. Fuck me. All the patriotic residents of Sevastopol were driven out, they are banned.\nCan I and others like me be useful to Sevastopol? Of course! But we are real patriots with principles, so we are on the reservation, and the Ovsyannikovs and the like are in business. But they will also find their chopping block.\nSo this is not a story about Ovsyannikov, but about how many things work.",
