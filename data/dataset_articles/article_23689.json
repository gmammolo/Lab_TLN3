  "text": "Plans are underway to transform up to 2,471 acres of farmland into London's largest nature haven.\nThis groundbreaking project, known as the Enfield Chase Landscape Restoration Project , is set to expand on the amazing woodland restoration work already happening at Enfield Chase in north London, according to BBC .\nOver the past four years, an impressive 140,000 trees have been planted in the area. And now, the project is taking things to the next level by launching a public consultation in June to get residents' input on how to make this \"nature haven\" even more incredible.\nAccording to John Cole, chairman of Friends of Enfield Chase, the possibilities are endless.\n\"The sky's the limit,\" he told BBC. \"There's an opportunity for the likes of ramblers, runners, and cyclists to know more about it and put it on the map.\"\nHe envisions opportunities for outdoor enthusiasts to explore and enjoy the space. Sculpture parks, allotments, tree nurseries, and community gardens are just a few of the ideas that could become a reality if there's enough interest.\nWatch now: Expert explains key contributor to recent wave of intense hurricanes But it's not just about creating a beautiful space for people to enjoy.
