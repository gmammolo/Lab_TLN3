  "text": "Tesla has been delivering EV fast charging infrastructure in Australia longer than any other company. With the strong rise in EV uptake over the past few years, there has been an acceleration in the number of new sites coming online. Now the company has opened its next round of sites across three states, adding 17 new fast chargers and bringing the total number of commissioned sites to 93. Starting in Queensland, Tesla has opened an 8-stall V3 supercharger site in Springwood, Queensland. This site is located in a shopping centre car park south of Brisbane. Each charger at the site is capable of delivering 250 kW of DC fast charging with many charging stalls tucked away next to a wall. This week, Tesla shared this site as the supercharger on its Tesla Charging X page. As of the writing of this article, this site is currently open to only Tesla vehicles and charging is priced at 56 c/kWh. New Tesla Supercharger: Springwood, QLD, Australia (8 stalls) [https://t.co/cS3tDDA4ga] [pic.twitter.com/yPpUIf89An] — Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) [July 17, 2024] Travelling south to NSW, earlier in the month, Tesla opened a 6-stall V4 supercharger site in the town of Griffith. This site is open to non-Tesla EVs as well with longer cables allowing ease of reaching the charge port on other EVs. Pricing at this site is set to 68 c/kWh for Tesla EVs and for non-Tesla EVs it’s increased to 92 c/kWh. Heading further south into Victoria, a 3-stall V3 supercharger site is now opened in the town of Kerang which is 280 km northwest of Melbourne. The site itself is located next to the IGA supermarket and other amenities in the area. Tesla also shared the opening of this site on the Tesla Charging X page. New Tesla Supercharger: Kerang, VIC, Australia (3 stalls) [https://t.co/hgqOC1oJTB] [pic.twitter.com/eWL4rvfYT2] — Tesla Charging (@TeslaCharging) [July 15, 2024] As seen in recent weeks, multiple sites across the country have come online while others are nearing completion. Many of these sites will see good utilisation during the coming months, particularly during the summer months. News of these sites comes only days after it was reported in The Driven that Australia has reached a major milestone [with over 1,000 fast-charging sites](https://thedriven.io/2024/07/12/major-milestone-australia-now-has-more-than-1000-fast-charging-sites/) now online across the country. With Tesla continuing its rollout of superchargers in Australia and other networks also contributing to the national rollout, it gives confidence to current owners and future EV drivers that they can road trip in an EV easier than ever.
