  "text": "By Elijah Espiritu In an effort to improve the agriculture sector through innovation, scientists and farmers work hand-in-hand developing more sustainable agrarian solutions. Producers and consumers slowly turn towards organic agricultural solutions, finding themselves in the middle of a market where organic practices are seen as the future of sustainable practice. The Ethnobotanical Dewormer for Native Chicken is an organic dewormer that helps reduce worm infestations in poultry, its main active ingredients are powdered betel nut, and ipil-ipil seeds. Developed by the science movers of BDOZ Veterinary Products Trading in the Philippines, the dewormer derived from mundane poultry and livestock feed ingredients ensures a sustainable and healthier alternative to normal dewormers. The development of this dewormer under the leadership of Bede P. Ozaraga, owner of BDOZ Veterinary Products Trading, succeeded in producing a 100% chemical free solution against the internal parasitism in poultry. With sustainability and quality of life in mind, Ozaraga created the product in hopes of shaping a future in agriculture where anyone can access and use agrarian solutions with ease and safety. Traditional Solutions for Traditional Problems At present, the practice of poultry deworming relies on the usage of industrially- developed medicine which contains chemicals that may scare away potential health-conscious customers. With the gradual transition of consumers towards organic products, the Ethnobotanical Dewormer supplies 100% organic solutions for the growing market. Adapting the classic methods, the idea for the Ethnobotanical Dewormer was conceived when Ozaraga’s team conducted a survey back in 1992 about the traditional methods of deworming chicken. Inspired by the traditions that withstood the test of time, Ozaraga set out to formulate the most effective dosage to effectively and efficiently control internal poultry parasitism. “In organic poultry raising, layer chicken, gamefowl production and duck production. Organic dewormer[s] are generally safer to the animals and the environment, reducing the risk of harmful side effects and chemical residues.” Bede P. Ozaraga On the benefits of Ethnobotanical Dewormer The Science Behind the Solution The Ethnobotanical Dewormer leverages the pre-established tradition of using Betel nuts and ipil-ipil seeds for their anthelmintic properties. The first ingredient, betel nut, contains arecoline which is a veterinary anthelmintic used to treat infections in animals caused by parasitic worms, it is used as astringents, stimulant laxative, and diuretic and acid bitter. Betel nuts also relieve hunger and abdominal discomfort. While the second ingredient, ipil-ipil, in its powdered form, is a common feed for poultry that also contains anthelmintic properties used to increase the healing properties of the formulation. Other organic powders are also added to the formulation aside from these two active ingredients. Dextrose powder, antifungal agents, and antibacterial agents are also added to the dewormer for increased effectiveness. Synthetic dewormers create health risk concerns among the livestock as well as the consumers, with one of the primary considerations being the residues left by chemical dewormers in chickens i.e. ivermectin. Beyond the Horizon: Challenges and Opportunities Highlighting his experience in the market, Ozaraga lamented his first market penetration activity expressing that with the novelty and obscure nature of his product comes the overwhelming strength of the market competition. Although the Ethnobotanical Dewormer’s excellence is already established, it might take a while for it to replace its synthetic counterparts. Agencies such as the Department of Science and Technology - Technology Application Promotion Institute (DOST-TAPI) provides programs and services to help bridge the gap between an invention or innovation and the target consumer. With this, the Ethnobotanical Dewormer for native chickens will shine at the upcoming WorldInvent Singapore 2024 Ozaraga expressed excitement over the opportunity that could give way for international exposure, and potential adoption or buy-outs for his product, enabling them to effectively establish themselves further in the market. “It is an honor and privilege to be participating in an international or world event. It gives us a unique opportunity to showcase our innovation [on] a global stage.” Bede P. Ozaraga On the government support for Ethnobotanical Dewormer The Ethnobotanical Dewormer invention team highlighted the importance of Filipino inventors to participate in international expositions, saying that this experience can expose the Filipino technologies in the world market, garnering mutual learning and benchmarking from the local and international entities. The Ethnobotanical Dewormer’s invention team continues to push their product’s boundaries through their passion to assist poultry raisers in providing science and technology solutions to their agrarian challenges. ** This article is part of the \"SPICE: Science and Technology Promotion for International Contest and Exhibits\" campaign for the participants of the WorldInvent Singapore 2024.
