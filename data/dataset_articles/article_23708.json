  "text": "In 2023, SEFA solidified its role as the leading energy transition facility in Africa. The year marked an important milestone with the closure of the SEFA 1.0 legacy portfolio while accelerating its implementation of SEFA 2.0, which is now in its fourth year of operation. It also saw the approval of nine projects for a combined funding amount of USD 72 million that are expected to generate 2,840 MW in new renewable energy capacity, approximately 1.3 million new electricity connections, 8,394,182t CO2 of GHG emissions reductions, and create around 160,000 new jobs.
