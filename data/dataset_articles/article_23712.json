  "text": "New Delhi: Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC – Masdar announced it has raised USD 1 billion through its second green bond issuance under its Green Finance Framework. The issuance comprises dual tranches of USD 500 million each, with tenors of 5 and 10 years and coupons of 4.875% and 5.25% respectively. The orderbook peaked at USD 4.6 billion, an oversubscription of 4.6 times, with an average split of 70% to international investors and 30% to MENA investors.The USD 1 billion proceeds will be used to fund Masdar’s equity commitments on new greenfield projects, several in developing economies. The company is targeting a portfolio capacity of 100GW by 2030.Masdar’s recently published 2023 Green Finance Report detailed the allocation and impact of its debut green bond, funding projects in emerging markets and the Global South with 3.7GW in total nominal capacity. These projects are expected to mitigate 5.4 million tonnes in GHG emissions annually when fully operational.Masdar is also making significant acquisitions of operational companies in mature markets, injecting capital and expertise, and contributing to the renewable energy capacity of global markets.CEO Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi said: “Following the successful launch of our first green bond in 2023, our second green bond issuance for USD 1 billion underscores investor confidence in Masdar’s financial robustness and its sustainability credentials. The funds will be pivotal in advancing our ambitious portfolio of renewable energy projects, further cementing our role as a key player in supporting an equitable energy transition by increasing energy access in emerging markets and the Global South.”CFO Mazin Khan said: “As we have committed under our Green Finance Framework, we are raising green bonds and other green finance instruments to invest in new dark green projects. This is an important component of our investor relations story, but it is also a commitment that we are transparently fulfilling through the publication of our audited annual allocation and impact reporting. Few companies as strongly rated as Masdar offer investors bonds that can make such a positive impact across the ESG spectrum. Even fewer companies can tell investors exactly where every dollar of their money is going and its impact.”The issuance was rated AA- by Fitch and A2 by Moody’s. Fitch recently upgraded Masdar's credit rating one notch to 'AA-', stable outlook, recognizing the company’s financial strength and shareholder support.The joint lead managers and bookrunners on the issuance were First Abu Dhabi Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Credit Agricole CIB, Natixis and MUFG.Masdar, established in 2006, has developed and partnered in projects in over 40 countries. The company aims to increase its renewable energy portfolio capacity to 100GW by 2030 and become a leading producer of green hydrogen by the same year.",
