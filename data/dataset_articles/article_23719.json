  "text": "bluefield — Summer heat has brought forth free lemonade that’s being poured today in the Bluefields, but rainy forecasts and cooling temperatures could put a dent in the region’s current drought. On Monday, a high of 90 degrees was reported at the Mercer County Airport, according to the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. The Chamber of Commerce of the Two Virginias was informed that same day, so free lemonade will be served today for the first time since 2019. Ever since 1941, free lemonade has been served after the official temperature reaches 90 degrees or more. Free lemonade will be served today between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. at city park in Bluefield in the grassy area near the tennis courts, at the Tailyard Dog Park in downtown Bluefield and at Jack Asbury Square in downtown Bluefield, Va. In contrast to the previous days of dry conditions and temperatures approaching 90 degrees, the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. has forecasted periods of showers and thunderstorms today and into early next week. Today’s forecast includes a 20% chance of rain for today and 40% tonight for the Bluefield area and a 30% chance in the Tazewell, Va. area. There is a 70% chance of rain Saturday with a high of 80 degrees, plus a chance of thunderstorms Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service in Blacksburg, Va. Between a quarter inch to a half inch of rain is possible Saturday in both areas. A weather front stalling over the mid-Atlantic states and the Southwest is bringing periods of showers and some thunderstorms, said meteorologist William Perry with the Blacksburg weather service. The forecast going into next week shows a possibility of 1.5 to 3 inches of rain, but thunderstorms could always bring in more precipitation. Since June 1, the region’s total rainfall has been around 4 inches below normal, Perry said. “June and July have been dry,” he said. “That’s why we have a drought on. Most of southwest West Virginia is in a severe drought. This next week could put some kind of dent in the drought.” While the heat has brought free lemonade to the Bluefields, it has also led to warnings that residents across the region should forego outdoor burning. On July 15, a 10-day burning ban was started in Tazewell County, Va. The ban was set to continue until July 25, and it will be reviewed by the Tazewell Board of Supervisors. County Administrator Eric Young was unavailable Thursday, but the burn ban was still in effect. The Tazewell County ban includes all outdoor burning activities, excluding cooking conducted within contained gas or charcoal grills. The goal of the burn ban is to prevent the spread of wildfires and safeguarding both residents and the region’s natural environment, said A.J. Robinson, director of community development. Violating the burn ban is considered a class-one misdemeanor, Robinson said. According to the Code of Virginia § 18.2-11, a Class 1 misdemeanor has a possible sentence of up to 12 months in jail and/or a fine of up to $2,500. People seeking clarification or with questions are encouraged to reach out to the Tazewell County Department of Emergency Management at the non-emergency number at 276-322-7393. To report burn ban violations, call the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office at 276-988-0645. For immediate concerns about active, uncontrolled fires, dial 911, Robinson said. On June 27, the Tazewell County Public Service Authority asked its customers to conserve water due to the low amounts of rainfall that month. The low water levels were mainly at the Claypool Hill treatment plant in the Wardell area, PSA Administrator Jan Cordle said. The area was not running out of water, but the authority’s 6,800 customers were asked to reduce the amount of water they use. The water levels being seen in July usually do not occur until August. Young said then that conserving water was voluntary and the county was not making it mandatory. Contact Greg Jordan at",
