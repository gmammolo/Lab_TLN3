  "text": "Judge finds Osceola County mom accused of drowning teen daughter incompetent to stand trial\nThe Osceola County mother accused of drowning her 14-year-old daughter in a bathtub was back in court Wednesday for a competency hearing.\nA judge found Kelsey Glover to be incompetent to stand trial on her own.\nTwo doctors testified on her behalf, Dr. Katherine Oses and Dr. Leonard Skizynski.\n\"We see her behave and then not behave, she presented a very disruptive behavior,\" said Dr. Oses.\nThey both diagnosed her with bipolar disorder.\n\"I believe she is incompetent to proceed based on symptoms of mental illness, and having bipolar I disorder, and medically psychotic features,\" said Dr. Skizynski.\nThe judge said that based on the testimony from both doctors and Glover's behavior in court, he found her incompetent to proceed and ruled that she was to be committed to a state hospital.\nOne of the doctors met with her just days after the initial arrest in November, and the other met with her in January.\nGlover's attorney raised questions about her mental health to the judge back in December. They said she completed a confidential competency evaluation in November.\nHer attorney also said Glover was unable to appreciate the charges against her, the potential penalties, the adversarial nature of the legal process, nor provide facts regarding the case, among other things.\nA grand jury indicted Glover on charges of first-degree premeditated murder in the death of her daughter, Giselle, as well as aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in the alleged attack on her roommate.\nThe judge asked for Glover to be back in court on Nov. 5 to review her treatment and competency status.\nAbout the victim\nCourt documents say the 14-year-old was sick, and Glover was to blame.\nAn arrest affidavit says the \"victim was type 1 diabetic and had an electric pump that administers insulin attached to her body.\"\nThe woman who called 911 said Glover stopped giving the teen her insulin on a Monday, and by that Wednesday, \"the (victim) became sick, vomiting, and eventually bedridden.\"\nThe woman told investigators, \"Kelsey Glover would keep the victim in the master bedroom with music playing to drown out her screams for help.\"\nThe woman also said Glover asked for help getting the child to the bathtub to bathe her.\n\"Witnesses also told deputies they saw Ms. Glover holding her 14-year-old daughter's head underwater in the bathtub, and they tried to stop her but were not successful,\" Osceola County Sheriff Marco Lopez said during a news conference shortly after Glover's arrest.",
