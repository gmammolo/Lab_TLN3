  "text": "Salt Lake City is taking a big step towards a more sustainable future with the launch of a new e-bike incentive program. This program aims to make e-bikes more accessible to residents, encouraging them to ditch their cars and embrace a greener mode of transportation. Inspired by Success Stories The program draws inspiration from similar initiatives in other cities like Denver, where resident discounts on e-bikes have proven wildly popular. Salt Lake City’s Mayor, Erin Mendenhall, believes e-bikes offer a multitude of benefits beyond environmental advantages. They can be a more affordable transportation option, especially as gas prices soar, and can provide a healthy and enjoyable way to get around for people with varying physical abilities. The Pilot Program This initial program is a pilot, funded with $200,000 from the city’s 2024 budget. Salt Lake City residents can apply online for a chance to win a rebate voucher worth $300 to $1,300. The specific amount depends on the applicant’s income and the type of e-bike they choose. Cargo and utility e-bikes are eligible for higher rebates due to their higher cost. Winners can redeem their vouchers at five participating bike shops within Salt Lake City. Looking to the Future The city is committed to improving cycling infrastructure in anticipation of a potential surge in e-bike ridership. Mendenhall highlighted the city’s ongoing efforts to build new bike lanes and improve existing ones. The program’s future iterations will depend on its success in this first round. However, the initial enthusiasm suggests a bright future for e-bikes in Salt Lake City. Businesses like Rad Power Bikes are eager to participate and hope the program will be expanded in the coming year.",
