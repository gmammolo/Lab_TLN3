  "text": "A reusable water bottle is a must for anyone who wants to stay hydrated and reduce plastic waste by ditching single-use water bottles. They’re easy to refill and sip throughout the day, but how often do you think of cleaning them? How dirty can a reusable bottle get if it’s only filled with water? Turns out, they can get pretty filthy.\nAccording to Dr. Brynna Connor, MD, a physician and healthcare ambassador at\nNorthWestPharmacy.com, water bottles can carry a lot of bacteria and potentially grow mold.\n“Mold thrives in moist environments and a water bottle with leftover water is the perfect breeding ground,” Dr. Connor says. “It’s even possible for mold spores in the air to land on your water bottle and subsequently grow.”\nThat being said, it’s important to clean your water bottle, just like any other piece of glassware or dinnerware you use. Here’s the ultimate guide for how to clean your water bottle.\nMeet the Expert\n- Dr. Brynna Connor, MD is a physician and healthcare ambassador at\nNorthWestPharmacy.com.\n- Marilee Nelson is a cleaning, environmental expert and co-founder of\nBranch Basics.\nHow Often Should You Actually Clean Your Water Bottle?\nHow often you should clean your water bottle can depend on how often you use it and what drinks you’re putting in it. But as a general rule: If you’re using your water bottle every day, you should clean it every day.\nAt the minimum, the bottle, straw, lid, or cap should be cleaned with soap, water, and a rinse regularly.
