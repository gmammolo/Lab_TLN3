[Photo provided to chinadaily.com.cn] Become a Farmer , a phenomenal agriculture-themed reality show by iQIYI, China's leading online entertainment service, concluded its season 2 to rapturous reviews on July 13.\nThe show's commitment to environmental sustainability in agriculture has earned it the title of Sustainable Agriculture Promotion Partner of the World Wide Fund for Nature, China (WWF China) and One Planet Foundation, according to iQIYI. In the latest season, experts from these environmental organizations participated in content production, advocating for biodiversity protection and sustainable farming practices.\nBy immersing ten urban youths into the realities of agricultural life, the original production, a collaboration between iQIYI and Blue Sky Media Group, became a black horse in China's variety show market in 2023.\nBecome a Farmer Season 2 cemented its remarkable success, topping the ranking of domestic popular variety shows for eight consecutive weeks on Douban, a major Chinese media review platform.\nThe show's second season saw the ten young men, with increased farming skills and business acumen, triple their farm size to 30 hectares. They introduced diverse new crops such as chilies alongside wheat and roses, developed derivative products like chili sauce and strawberry jam, and also created an integrated farm featuring fishponds and crayfish fields.\nAudience members also manifested sustained interest in the participants beyond the show, closely following and supporting them as they ventured to launch businesses, empowered livestream commerce, organized music festivals, and more.\nWidely acclaimed for highlighting the participants' uplifting journeys of personal growth by dedicating themselves to farming, the show was nominated for the Best Variety Show at the 29th Shanghai TV Festival for the second consecutive year.\nThe widespread popularity of Become a Farmer in exploring the niche agricultural theme showcases iQIYI's success in creating and delivering original content that resonates with diverse audiences, according to the company.\nIn addition to the show, iQIYI said it would continue educating the public on the importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable agriculture. For example, it will launch several initiatives, including citizen science activities on pollinator insects in September.",
