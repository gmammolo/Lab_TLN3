  "text": "Behnam Hormozi, founder of Integrals Power, says he plans to scale up the Milton Keynes factory - David Hartley A new generation of electric car batteries using materials made in Britain could extend the number of miles vehicles can travel after one charge. Integrals Power, which is based in Milton Keynes, is vying to supply gigafactories with a breakthrough material that it says will make batteries more powerful and last longer. This week, the company opened the UK’s only factory capable of producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode powder, where it plans to produce small amounts before scaling up. The cathode is the material used for the positive electrode, determining the voltage and capacity of a lithium-ion battery. So-called range anxiety is often named as one of the biggest factors preventing drivers from switching from a car with a standard combustion engine to an electric model. A lack of charging points across the UK means cars with greater battery range enable drivers to make longer, cross-country, journeys. Behnam Hormozi, founder and chief executive of Integrals Power, said: “The cathode is the most critical part of the cell because it determines the battery’s overall performance, cost and durability. “That’s why our breakthroughs in cathode active material will enable electric vehicles to achieve longer range, faster charging and higher performance from smaller, lighter battery packs. “We also source our raw materials from Europe and the US, so we can help cell suppliers and vehicle manufacturers to develop a more robust, transparent supply chain that mitigates geopolitical issues.” It comes as Western governments are trying to reduce their chronic dependence on China, where 90pc of battery cathode material and 100pc of LFP materials are currently made. Rishi Sunak’s government previously set out plans to “onshore” some of this production, partly via relief on electricity costs, amid fears Beijing could threaten supplies during a geopolitical crisis. The company’s factory will initially produce 20 tons per year of cathode material, before scaling up to 1,000 tons over the next two years after securing its first orders, Mr Hormozi said. However, he said the modular production methods being used meant that it could in theory scale up to 100,000 tons, depending on demand. A big chunk of that is likely to come from Europe-based companies that will soon be forced to source at least 70pc of the materials for electric car batteries either in the UK or on the Continent. Under the post-Brexit “rules of origin” regime, these requirements will come into force in 2027. “That is definitely a great advantage to have over the next few years,” Mr Hormozi said. Several different chemical compositions are currently used for batteries that power electric cars, with some primarily powered by lithium and others by nickel, for example. But LFP batteries are seen as the “rising star” of the industry, accounting for 40pc of electric car demand last year, according to the International Energy Agency. That market share has more than doubled since 2020. Global battery production is dominated by China, which also controls the lion’s share of critical mineral refining as well. In recent years, the US, EU and UK have all set out strategies to reduce – albeit not eliminate – their dependence on Beijing. On top of electric cars, Mr Hormozi said the cathode material developed by Integrals Power also had applications in other areas, such as power tools.
