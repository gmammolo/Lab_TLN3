  "text": "Plant more trees for sustainable future THE EDITOR, Madam: The value of trees in the inevitable hurricane season should never be underestimated. In 2019, Prime Minister Andrew Holiness initiated a three million tree-planting drive, with a timeframe of three years. By September of 2023, 2.7 million trees were planted under the national initiative, with the remaining 300,000 to be planted by the end of 2023, which was commendable. There was a shortfall and the target could not be met. According to Ainsley Henry, CEO and conservator of forests at Jamaica’s Forestry Department , “the severe drought in the middle of 2023, coupled with the beginning of COVID, posed a challenge” in the progress of attaining the slated target. A continuation of tree planting should be encouraged. There should be awareness campaigns to educate people about the significance of trees. Homeowners who can facilitate the planting of trees should also make this a priority. During the onslaught of Hurricane Beryl, we would have seen where trees took the battering as they, in some way, warded off destruction from houses and other structures. Also, trees help in the prevention of soil erosion in such a catastrophe. Some trees in certain areas did not budge in Beryl’s brutal battering. Soil erosion would have meant destruction of properties and even loss of lives. What of the planting of trees in major towns, where some areas resemble concrete jungles? Too often, there is groundbreaking for the erection of buildings, with scant regard for the replanting of trees or creating green spaces. Planting of trees for aesthetics and to provide shade should also be encouraged. There should also be proper maintenance to control overgrowth. Additionally, shrubs and flowering plants should also be considered, which are aesthetically appealing. We need to recognise the importance of trees and encourage people to plant more.
