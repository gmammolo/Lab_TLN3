  "text": "By Todd Feurer\nClick here for updates on this story\n CHICAGO ( WBBM ) — A Chicago real estate broker is headed to federal prison for scamming investors out of more than $3 million.\nStanislav “Steve” Sannikov, 42, was sentenced to four years and two months in prison on Friday, after pleading guilty last year to a federal wire fraud charge.\nSannikov owned Chestnut Realty Group, and prosecutors said from 2016 to 2020, he promised big profits on fake property deals – convincing victims to wire money into what he claimed were escrow accounts.\nProsecutors said those accounts were just personal checking accounts he used to fund a lavish lifestyle.\nSannikov had lied to his victims by telling them they were investing in properties that were for sale, and that could be resold or leased for a substantial profit, when the properties were not actually available for sale.\nOne victim in his 70s was forced to delay his retirement due to his losses.\n“This was not a one-time lapse in judgment,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri H. Mecklenburg argued in the government’s sentencing recommendation. “Defendant, over the course of at least four years, designed and engaged in a calculated, sustained, multi-faceted scheme to defraud multiple individuals.”\nIn addition to his prison sentence, Sannikov must pay $2.19 million in restitution to four victims of his scam.\nPlease note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.
