  "text": "BETHEL — Alongside the meandering Androscoggin River under a blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds, tall grass waves in the gentle breeze.\nBethel Farmer Ed Swain calls this painterly island, “a unique spot.”\nGone now are the many other island farms that once dotted the Androscoggin River in Western Maine; Swain stands as the last island farmer in this part of the state. He says access was most likely why others no longer island farm.\nHis own access, sometimes very difficult, is mostly doable. While Swain’s land flooded in 2023, he dismisses it as, “an odd year … a 100-year flood.”\nOver the years, Swain’s father acquired many of the smaller adjoining plots that now constitute his son’s expansive 100-acre farm. While he actively farms 60 of those acres, he also tends to additional parcels owned by others who rely on him for haying services.\nIsland tour\nThe Androscoggin River splits and rejoins itself in several places in Bethel and Gilead. Swain’s island stretches more than a mile in distance.\nSwain who has been driving a tractor since he was seven or eight, powers through a 125-foot span of the river in his large pick-up truck with “good tires,” to reach his island. Long tufts of grass get stuck in the grill so the front of the truck ends up looking like a mustached face.\nWhen the river has been very high, “We’ve hauled corn across in an old motor boat,” he says, pointing to a former ice house where he stores a tractor or two in case of high water in the winter.\nSwain grows vegetables, too. “My rows are pretty straight, almost as good as Sunday River [potato] Farms,” he brags.\nHe plants his island corn every week to 10 days, offering customers fresh batches at the farmstand through the fall. Off-island he grows and sells tomatoes, potatoes, zucchini, summer squash, peppers, eggplant, cabbage, broccoli, pumpkins and decorative corn.\nHaying\nSwain watches the weather carefully since the hay needs to bake in the hot sun for three consecutive days. Some years they have the first haying done by the Fourth of July, he didn’t think that would happen this year, but in the end the weather cooperated. On July 2 and 3 Swain’s four friends show up to work, plus a few high school helpers.\nTelstar senior Kyle Kimball, 17, of Gilead, points to where he saw a bald eagle fly over his head, “When I’m here, it’s like I’m in a Hardy Boys novel,” he says.\nOn his father’s urging, he answered the ad to help with haying, as his father, Josh, had done when he was a teenager.\nOn his first day Kyle was late. When he called, Swain told him he’d have to cross the river on foot since they were already on the island.\nSwain starts the arduous project with a haying mower that has an eight-foot span.\nA tedder spreads the hay out across the field to help dry it. Next, they rake it into circular windrows. Finally, Swain rides his tractor in circles with the baler attached. Magically squared bales pop out the back of the baler where the other workers load it on trailers.\nOn hot days, he appreciates the shade the round baler tractor offers. Those bales are larger and clearing a field is faster, but most of his customers can’t handle the larger sized bales.\nGeorge Clement and Cheryl Emerson of Shelbourne, NH come to the haying, too, loading their own trailer with 30 square bales of hay that they will use to feed their two horses. Their trailer is new and untested and George worries that they won’t make it through the river on the way out, but all goes well. On the next run, he says he’ll load the hay even higher, taking home 90 bales in all.\nSwain sells much of his hay to nearby Sunday River Ski Resort where they use it for construction projects. DiAnne Ward at Albany’s Deepwood Farm and others who own horses and cattle buy the rest of the hay.\nHe likes to have a barn full of hay for winter, too.\nCostly\nThe produce they sell from their gardens at Swain’s is more lucrative than the money made from haying.\n“To hay you have to keep so much equipment,” like their five transport trailers.\nRepairs are costly, too. “Twenty bucks a piece for those [tedder] teeth … My other rake broke apart, so that one’s new –$10,300 for a new rake.”\nSummer helper Kimball and his father expected to see a high tech operation since it had been several years since Josh worked at Swain Family Farm, but still in use are Swain’s father’s six 1950’s-era tractors.\nSwain had to lay off his mechanic last winter, so is the sole repairman now.\nBut for Swain, island farming overall is worthwhile because while floods and ice jams can be disruptive, he views the rich soil left behind as a boon, “They say it’s some of the most fertile land in the world.”\nJoin the Conversation\nPlease\n[sign into](#) your Press Herald account to participate in conversations below.
