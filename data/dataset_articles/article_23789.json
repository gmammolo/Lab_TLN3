  "text": "TDK receives SBT certification of its greenhouse gas reduction targets - The international SBTi has verified TDK greenhouse gas reduction targets as science based - Targets are set for both direct emissions and emissions from the entire value chain - Medium-term targets support the ultimate goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 July 19, 2024 TDK Corporation (TSE: 6762) announces that its fiscal 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets are now verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). SBTi recognizes that TDK’s targets are science-based targets for limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C above the pre-industrial level, in line with the Paris Agreement (Date of verification by SBTi: June 20, 2024). The following TDK targets have been certified: Target 1: Reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% within fiscal 2030 from a fiscal 2021 base year. Target 2: Reducing absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services and use of sold products by 25% within fiscal 2030 from a fiscal 2021 base year. Target 3: Encouraging 5% of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services to have science based targets by fiscal 2028. As part of the company’s efforts to achieve these goals, TDK has promoted the introduction of renewable energy sources. TDK aims to increase the percentage of electricity used by all manufacturing sites globally from renewable energy sources to 50% by fiscal 2025, and to 100% by fiscal 2050. Since July 2023, all manufacturing sites in Japan operate with 100% electricity from renewable energy sources. TDK achieved the mid-term target of 50% by fiscal 2025 in fiscal 2023, two years ahead of schedule. Based on the SBT certification, TDK plans to further reduce GHG emissions and encourage its suppliers to set GHG emission reduction targets, thereby reducing GHG emissions throughout its supply chain and contributing to a sustainable future. Glossary - GHG: greenhouse gas - SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative): Established in 2015 by four organizations: CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), and the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). It defines and promotes best practices in science-based target and setting and independently assesses companies’ targets.
