  "text": "With so many wonderful state parks and preserves with abundant hiking trails and beautiful waterfalls , Ohio is a great place for green spaces. But what about living green? According to a study by WalletHub , Ohio is not the greenest state in the U.S., but it’s also not at the bottom of the rankings. With climate disasters happening every year, it’s important for humans to make the environment better rather than worse. Personal finance and eco-friendliness are related—especially when we look for sustainable materials, drink and use clean water, and put our tax money into environmental security. WalletHub looked at all 50 states, using three categories and 25 key metrics to rank where each state stands, from how well they prioritize being green to states that do a poor job of caring for their environment. Where does Ohio rank among the greenest states in the U.S.? Ohio sits near the middle of the rankings of the greenest states, per WalletHub. The Buckeye State ranks at No. 28 out of 50 states, earning a score of 58.05 out of 100. Not too bad, but it could be better. Furthermore, Ohio rests near the middle in all three of WalletHub's three main categories: No. 25 in environmental quality, No. 35 in eco-friendly behaviors, and No. 26 in climate change contributions. The Buckeye State was one of the worst states for the percentage of renewable energy consumption. It ranked No. 46 nationally, just ahead of New Jersey, Alaska, Louisiana and Delaware. Rankings in the Midwest: How Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan fared Michigan earned the highest ranking as the greenest state in the Midwest, taking the No. 15 spot, with Illinois following in the No. 16 spot. Then, Wisconsin (No. 20) and Pennsylvania (No. 23) ranked a little bit ahead of Ohio. Indiana (No. 33), Kentucky (No. 46) and No. 50 West Virginia finished below the Buckeye State. In addition, Kentucky earns a spot as one of the worst states at being green, having its lowest score in the eco-friendly behavior category and some of the worst air quality in the country. On the plus side, the Bluegrass State tied for the No. 1 spot for water quality. Top, bottom five greenest states in the U.S. Top five greenest states in the U.S. - California - Vermont - New York - Maryland - Washington Top five worst states at being green in the U.S. - West Virginia - Louisiana - Alabama - Mississippi - Kentucky Most environmentally friendly states ranked from Nos. 1–50 The full WalletHub rankings with total score: |Overall Rank||State||Total Score| |1||California||75.75| |2||Vermont||74.75| |3||New York||74.67| |4||Maryland||74.35| |5||Washington||72.90| |6||Minnesota||70.51| |7||Hawaii||70.36| |8||Maine||70.10| |9||Connecticut||69.83| |10||Massachusetts||69.69| |11||Delaware||69.58| |12||Rhode Island||68.69| |13||Oregon||68.44| |14||Colorado||67.61| |15||Michigan||66.32| |16||Illinois||64.78| |17||South Dakota||64.74| |18||Nevada||64.50| |19||New Hampshire||63.63| |20||Wisconsin||62.87| |21||Virginia||62.62| |22||Utah||61.49| |23||Pennsylvania||60.43| |24||New Jersey||60.42| |25||North Carolina||60.31| |26||South Carolina||59.34| |27||Montana||58.56| |28||Ohio||58.05| |29||Iowa||57.45| |30||Idaho||57.15| |31||Florida||56.63| |32||Georgia||56.47| |33||Indiana||55.03| |34||Missouri||54.44| |35||Kansas||53.33| |36||Arizona||53.22| |37||Nebraska||52.52| |38||Texas||50.40| |39||Tennessee||49.50| |40||Oklahoma||47.60| |41||Arkansas||46.62| |42||New Mexico||46.59| |43||North Dakota||42.91| |44||Wyoming||42.45| |45||Alaska||39.04| |46||Kentucky||38.37| |47||Mississippi||37.22| |48||Alabama||36.45| |49||Louisiana||28.62| |50||West Virginia||22.38|",
