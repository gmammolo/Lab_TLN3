  "text": "( MENAFN - Trend News Agency) BAKU, Azerbaijan, July 19. The renewable energy sources have been created and used for almost 13 years of operation of SOCAR's“Eco Park” in Gala, which provides electricity to the entire park with an area of about 20 ha, the head of the park Tahir Shikhaliyev told Trend .\n\"Earlier, this place used to be the territory of an old oil and gas production department. The land was polluted with oil sludge. However, as a result of land reclamation works 25–30 centimeters deep, it became possible to open a park with different trees and plants common in Absheron in this area. There is a water source on the territory of the park, three wind turbines with 10 kWh of electricity are working, and solar panels are installed on the roofs of buildings. The territory is fully supplied with electricity through renewable energy sources. This project has demonstrated the possibilities of adaptation to“green” projects in Azerbaijan, and the experience of this park can be useful in the country,” Shikhaliyev said.\nTo note, SOCAR organized a media tour of its Eco Park on July 18 on the occasion of the \"Year of Solidarity for a Green World,\" the upcoming 30th anniversary of the \"Contract of the Century,\" and National Press Day (celebrated on July 22).\nThe press secretary of SOCAR, Orkhan Huseynov, emphasized that SOCAR attaches special importance to the expansion of effective relations with the media and provided information on the strategic goals of the state company, defined in the Corporate Strategy until 2035, and the work done in the direction of transformation from an oil and gas company to an international energy company.\nHuseynov also mentioned that environmental protection and ecology issues are under the close attention of SOCAR; in particular, Baku Bay has been completely purified.\nThe assistant director general of Ekol Engineering Services CJSC Sabutay Aliyev, provided detailed information on waste management measures, the land reclamation process, and the landscaping of territories.\nMENAFN19072024000187011040ID1108458615",
