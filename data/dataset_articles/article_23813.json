  "text": "If you've got some containers and some soil, you can easily grow a garden without needing a ton of outdoor space. Here's how to get started. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a lot of land to start a garden. In fact, all you really need are some containers and soil. Container gardens have gained popularity since not only are they easy to start, but they also can enhance a space with additional vibrant colors and pleasant smells. “Container gardening is a method of growing plants that allows you to bypass the constraints of limited outdoor space, making it a particularly viable solution for those residing in urban areas,” says Stephanie Elhayani, co-owner and chief floral officer at Seed Floral . “From small pots to larger planters, you can select the right container to fit your space and the specific needs of your plants so you can have a bountiful garden no matter where you live.” We spoke with expert florists about how to start a container garden, whether you’re looking to grow vegetables, herbs, or classic flowers. How to start a container garden step by step Whether you’re a seasoned gardener or need a refresher, we’re going to lay out how to start a container garden step by step with guidance from professional florists. Step 1: Get a container with proper drainage Step 2: Gather the soil, gardening tools, flowers, and seeds Step 3: Put the plants in the containers Step 4: Put the containers in a location with optimal sunlight Step 5: Water your plants regularly How to create a container garden, explained Step 1: Get a container with proper drainage As the name suggests, a container garden requires containers. There are a variety of containers available on the market, from those made out of plastic to ceramic. “The most common options include terra-cotta, metal , concrete, a food-grade bucket, and grower's pot,” says Elhayani. Not sure which to choose? The Outsunny Rectangle Brown Wood Outdoor Raised Planter Box is a solid option as it can blend into nearly any room with its fir wood construction and has a water-resistant paint coat for optimal durability. For individual plants, these minimalist flower pots from Utopia Home work well since they are equipped with drainage holes at the bottom and come with a drip tray to catch excess water. If the container you choose doesn’t come with drainage holes, Elhayani says you can make your own holes, whether by puncturing the bottom by hand or using a power drill.

Aside from the container, potting soil should be the next item on your list. “Choose quality soil that is designed for containers or raised beds, not in-ground use,” says Kim Zimmerman, master gardener and head designer for Rowdy Poppy . “A quality soil will have everything you need in there to get your plants going; you can always fertilize for additional support once they are established.” Whether you’re trying to grow flowers or plants, Miracle-Gro Potting Mix and Burpee Premium Organic Potting Natural Soil Mix are suitable for indoor and outdoor use and can feed for anywhere between three and six months. Once you have the soil, you’ll want to have the proper tools to plant correctly and safely. Opt for a pair of gardening gloves like those from Midwest Quality Inc. to keep your hands free from dirt and protected against sharp hand tools , including trowels, transplanters, and cultivators. Plus, don’t forget about a watering can , which can easily be purchased on Amazon, to make sure your plants are getting the proper amount of water as needed. Last but not least, you need to get the flowers and seeds you want to grow in your container garden. Without them, you’ll be left with a container of dirt.

In general, the deeper, the better when it comes to planting in your container garden. “Fill around plants with mix, ensuring stems are no deeper than in nursery containers,” says Elhayani. Step 4: Put the containers in a location with optimal sunlight The amount of sunlight needed depends on the types of plants you grow. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), it’s important to ensure your plants receive six to eight hours of direct sunlight. If access to sunlight is hard to come by in your living space, then you’ll want to consider growing plants that require more shade, such as hostas, herbs, and ferns. Step 5: Water your plants regularly Similar to traditional plants, it’s important to water the plants in a container garden regularly. This will vary based on the type, however, you’ll want to make sure you’re doing it often enough. That said, the key is to make sure you’re not overwatering them, which can cause them to die. Some factors that will dictate how much and how often to water the plants include weather, plant type, and container size. Container vegetable garden tips Having a container garden full of vegetables is a great way to have fresh food grown right at your fingertips. Here are some tips from our gardening experts. - Leave ample space in the container: According to Zimmerman, vegetables tend to grow quite large, so make sure to give plenty of space. “This may mean being realistic about how many plants you can fit – you may need to prioritize your favorites,” she adds. “If you are very tight on space, then consider choosing veggies that are bred to have a smaller overall plant size.” - Plan for the different seasons: Some vegetables thrive in cool weather and will not be happy in the heat of summer, such as broccoli, brussels, carrots, peas and leafy greens. “Warm weather vegetables like tomatoes, zucchini, and peppers need the heat to thrive,” says Zimmerman. Herb garden container tips A container garden is also a great space for growing herbs to use in the kitchen to add some flavor. - Use larger containers: You’ll want to refrain from planting herbs in too-tight vessels as this can restrict growth. “Treat your herbs like your veggies and give them more space or even interplant some within your vegetable containers,” says Zimmerman. - Do your research: Some herbs can be quite vigorous (some may say aggressive), so consider what you’re planting together. According to Zimmerman, herbs in the mint family tend to spread quickly and may choke out another plant, so you may want to give your mint its own container. Container garden ideas The possibilities are endless when it comes to container gardens, whether you’re interested in planting vibrant flowers or earthy vegetables. Here are some ideas to help get you started: - Window box flowers: Add a decorative flare to your living space with window box flowers, which are perfect for spring and summer. - Tall palms: Make a statement with your container garden by planting tall palms. Place these on a porch, patio, or deck to add some dimension. - Indoor herbs: Those interested in cooking can benefit from an indoor herb garden to grow thyme, rosemary, basil, and other aromatic herbs. - Pink flowers: Add a pop of color to your living space by growing pink flowers in a container garden. - Microgreens: Give your meals a nutrient boost by growing microgreens in containers on your windowsill or outdoor patio. Frequently asked questions What is the cheapest way to make a container garden? There are a few ways to save money when making a container garden from the products used to what is grown. “Use inexpensive containers, like buckets or dishpans from thrift stores, as gardening planters and add drainage holes,” says Elhayani. Zimmerman adds that it’s a good idea to check out local nurseries and free pages to see if any extras are available. What is the most common mistake made with container plants? According to Zimmerman, the most common mistake made with container plants is not giving plants enough space to grow. “This shows up in both choosing too-small containers and planting things too closely together,” she adds. How deep should a container garden be? Container gardens should be pretty deep to provide optimal growing conditions. “Generally speaking, the deeper the better here, especially if you’re growing vegetables,” says Zimmerman. “Roughly 18 inches is my minimum recommended depth, 30” is even better.” You May Also Like Go Further Animals Dragonflies can reveal mercury contamination.
