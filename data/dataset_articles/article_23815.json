  "text": "During the lockdowns in Delhi in 2020, when most public places were shut, the only outdoor spaces that remained accessible were the capital’s pockets of green. In parks like Sunder Nursery, Lodhi Gardens and Sanjay Van, residents found pockets of peace amidst nature. It was then that Malavika Bhatia, a 30-year-old local, began spotting fascinating mushrooms in Delhi’s parks—sprouting from decades-old tree trunks, clustered in a muddy corner and hiding expertly under plants and leaves. “They were really curious little ecosystems in their own right,” they say. Monsoon is when these ecosystems thrive, appearing in the unlikeliest places across lush forests as well as busy cities like Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and more. We walk by these stunning mushrooms—which show up in a variety of shapes, colours and striking patterns—everyday, but only a trained eye can really spot them. Bhatia is part of a small but growing community of mushroom spotters and enthusiasts in India, who lead trails across different parts of the country, introducing curious folks to these fascinating ecosystems hidden in plain sight. Last year, they also organised the first edition of Shroom Sabha, a four-day festival in Kerala that featured foraging and exploration trails, and workshops of mushroom cultivation, pairings and more. The festival saw over 100 attendees and will be back for a second edition in October this year. Meet the mushroom spotters Bhatia is a Psychology graduate who was always interested in nature. A wild food foraging course before the pandemic got her thinking about wild mushrooms found in the country. Bhatia began leading mushroom-spotting walks in the capital in 2021. “We tend to think of cities as concrete jungles where nothing really grows. Mushrooms really disrupt that idea,” they say. “These opportunistic organisms grow anywhere and everywhere to consume food and nutrients. You can find them on the sidewalk, on tree barks, in flower pots. If you leave a chair out in your backyard for a few months, there will be mushrooms growing on it in no time. They exist all around us, and once you learn to see them, you really can’t stop noticing them.” Bhatia met Bengaluru-based Vhyom Bhatt on a mushroom enthusiasts whatsapp group with over 200 members. It was 2021 and Bhatt had just spent several months in Himachal Pradesh, where he had discovered mushrooms like gucchi (morel mushrooms), chicken of the woods and chanterelle. “Local communities in Himachal have so much knowledge about these mushroom varieties that most of us wouldn’t even know about. That’s when I really got into mushroom identification and foraging. I discovered about 30-35 mushroom species that were completely new to me,” he says. He started growing mushrooms at home, and soon joined Nuvedo, a Bengaluru-based start-up that creates mushroom-based products, including DIY mushroom growing kits. To educate consumers, he began conducting mushroom spotting walks in Bengaluru, and hasn’t stopped since. Much like Bhatia, Goa resident and naturalist Omkar Dharwadkar always felt an affinity for nature and the outdoors. When he was in college studying computer engineering, he would spend weekends in the wilderness of Goa with a small group of friends and volunteer at nature camps for kids so he could meet wildlife experts. He joined a resort as a naturalist soon after he graduated college, and went on to found Mrugaya Xpeditions, a tour company that offers nature trails in Goa. Fungi and mushrooms especially intrigued him. “They are present in every habitat in the world, from the hottest to the coldest places on earth,” he says. “What’s interesting is that they adapt to their surroundings in such unique ways, with different shapes, colours, odours and even bioluminescence,” he says. Where to go mushroom spotting in India “One thing to remember is that every place in the world will have mushrooms, and you can spot them if you’re visiting in the right season,” Bhatt says. Monsoon is the reproductive period for fungi and the best time to spot some seriously fascinating mushrooms in India. “If you go into a forest and see a lot of mushrooms, it’s a great sign that the forest floor is fertile and in prime condition,” he says. A forest's mycelial network is often likened to the human nervous system. Mushrooms help decompose dead matter, improve nutrient intake of plants and make forests and soil more resilient. And it helps that they are incredibly cool to look at; if, of course, you learn to really look. Here are Bhatia, Bhatt and Dharwadkar’s recommendations for the best places to go mushroom spotting in Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa and Kerala, and what to spot while you’re there: Delhi In Delhi, Bhatia recommends heading to Sunder Nursery and Lodhi Gardens during the monsoon to spot unusual mushrooms. One of her favourite mushrooms to spot is the bird’s nest mushroom, which mimics a tiny bird’s nest, eggs and all. “There are these mushrooms called Earth stars that are found in the Central Ridge Reserve Forest. They almost look like constellations on the forest floor,” they say. Follow Malavika on Kerala Visit Wayanad in Kerala towards the end of the monsoon season in September. “One of the most beautiful mushrooms to spot in Wayanad, on the outskirts of Periyar National Park, are bridal veil stinkhorns, named so because of the white, veil-like lacy structure around its stalk” Bhatia says. “They are gorgeous and they’re also edible. You can also find giant oyster mushrooms here that are 2-3 times the size of a human head and are also edible.” Bengaluru Bhatt recommends heading to Cubbon Park in the monsoon to spot mushrooms. “I spotted bridal veil mushrooms there, but instead of a white veil, they had bright orange veils which were so striking. You can spot termitomyces, which grow on termite mounds. These are edible and are used in many households as a meat replacement during Shravan. It’s a very heavily harvested mushroom but finding it in a public park is very cool. I have also spotted wild oyster mushrooms and beautiful orange gymnopilus at the park.” Follow Vhyom on Goa In the forested parts of Goa, away from its sandy beaches and popular tourist spots, several mushroom species grow in abundance. When the rains turn the forests of Mollem, Netravali and Mhadei lush green, mushrooms in various shapes, sizes and colours, and fascinating features like bioluminescence, make a brief but stunning appearance. “The glowing mushrooms in Goa are by far the most fascinating mushrooms I have ever seen,” says Dharwadkar. “I have mostly spotted them in the forested areas in Goa, where they appear during monsoon. There’s no way to tell exactly when and where they will appear and their lifespan is just about 2-3 days. I also love spotting glowing fungus, which appears on dead plant matter and sometimes even on live trees. The fruiting body is never visible but only the mycelium glows in the dark. I have also spotted bird’s nest mushrooms in Mollem National Park and Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary. Bracket fungus typically show up across Goa in different shapes and sizes, but the fascinating part about them is the release of the spores. These are actually billions of spores being dispersed by the wind and sometimes at certain angles of light, the spores scatter light into its visible spectrum—it almost appears like smoke being released from the fungus. Lastly, zombie fungus, which is an insect-pathogenic fungus, attaches itself to insects and alters their behavioural patterns. It essentially makes the insect behave in a way that’s beneficial to the fungus. I have seen them across Goa, in various habitats, and it really is like an otherworldly experience.
