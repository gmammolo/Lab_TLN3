  "text": "Garden Guy: Next year's spring garden will be the belle of the ball with Supertunia Tiara Pink Norman Winter | For the Savannah Morning News One of the plants that literally took my breath away at the plant trials this year was the new Supertunia Tiara Pink. Shoot, I am not even a pink flower guy in the least, but this one had me mesmerized. Subsequently the ones made available to me in testing have been the same ― and Holy Wow!\nI’ve recently posted a photo on my Facebook page, and it quickly brought in the accolades and comments. More than one comment came from gardeners who were already growing it despite Supertunia Tiara Pink not making its debut until 2025. I suppose that it was a soft release.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink will reach about 12 inches tall with a 24 inch spread. I am watching not only my personal plants but some I slipped into VIP and high visibility targets. I am thinking we may get more spread in the south, but regardless, this will be on the must-have list next spring. The color blends are what make this flower so incredible.\nMore Garden Guy: Plant lovers Totally Stoked for bodacious blue and white asters\nProven Winners calls the color \"Princess Pink\" with a white center. I suppose that is true, but I see a much richer pink around the white. Its funny even on the Proven Winners site, the photos look a little subdued compared to what I have seen. But this may be one of those plants that give you a variance in color depending on the amount of sun, time of day and cloud cover. In fact, I remember the day of the Young’s Plant Farm Annual Garden Tour. It was a heavy overcast morning. My camera is capturing what I am seeing with my eyes.\nI would be remiss if I didn’t tell you there is also a Supertunia Tiara Blue, which that will be the subject of a later column. I had Facebook followers ask if it would partner well with Supertunia Vista Bubblegum, and I suppose it would, but to me that would be a waste since Bubblegum is so vigorous.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink deserves to be grown with a blue like Supertunia Mini Vista Indigo petunia or Superbells Grape Punch calibrachoa. Go ahead and say those are purple. Son James and the Eden Estate Management team used it at a streetside bed around a mailbox and partnered it with various Luscious Royale lantanas. To me it was pushing the envelope, but I also have to admit it was stunning. I suspect one of the future hallmark combos will be Supertunia Tiara Pink with a new scaevola also showing up next year called Stardiva Blue.\nSupertunia Tiara Pink will need fertile well-drained soil. I already mentioned my son planted some in a raised curbside bed, but containers and baskets with a really good potting soil are easy-peasy. This year has been like none other with intense heat and virtually no rain. I have had to water containers twice a day several times.\nFertilization plays a key role with Supertunias, even more so when watered twice a day. I use a water-soluble mix and pour from a watering can with a spout. That is my method and occurs every 2 to 3 weeks in the morning before the Mrs. has breakfast. Cutting back by a third has been vital in the south this year on Supertunias, Superbells and Superbenas. I know it is my imagination, but the plants almost seem to say thanks.\nNext year will be amazing for gardeners with new plant introductions. Maybe we all needed a tough year to hone our gardening skills. So, get ready and brush up on your photography skills too, you will really need them next year.\nFollow Norman Winter on Facebook @NormanWinterTheGardenGuy for more photos and garden inspiration.
