  "text": "PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, Va. — Federal prosecutors in Virginia dropped charges against a man they say is an MS-13 gang leader on Wednesday.\nHenrry Josue Villatoro Santos, 24, was charged with unlawful possession of firearms by someone in the country illegally. On March 27, agents with the FBI surrounded his mother’s home in Dale City and used a stun grenade to take Santos into custody.\nIn court, officer Jason Klepec of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on top of an outstanding administrative immigration warrant, there was also a criminal search warrant.\nInvestigators said they found guns, ammunition, suppressors and signs or marks of MS-13 association in his garage bedroom. In an interview with WUSA9, Santos’ mother denied knowledge of his alleged gang involvement.\nProsecutors dismissed charges without prejudice, meaning they're leaving the door open to charge him again.\nWUSA9 has reached out to federal authorities to ask why charges were dropped. But, we have not heard back at this time.",
