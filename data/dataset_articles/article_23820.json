  "text": "Ambassador Sticker and ACTED’s Savell-Boss sign the Aid Food Program agreement Moroto, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The French Government has given 535,000 euros (sh2.1 billion) worth of humanitarian assistance to the Karamoja region under the Aid Food Programme 2024.\nThrough this project, ACTED, in consortium with Caritas Moroto diocese, received a grant from the French Embassy in Uganda, to enhance food security and nutritional health of vulnerable households inNakapiripirit and Amudat districts.\nACTED is a global NGO with a mission to achieve zero poverty, zero exclusion, and zero carbon.\nSpecifically, ACTED and Caritas (a Catholic church-affiliated charity) Moroto diocese will contribute to improving food security through agricultural practices for 1,500 vulnerable households.\nThis one-year project, which will start in August, also aims to reduce the prevalence of stunting among children under two years old in targeted communities within the next year, through selected Maternal Child Health and Nutrition interventions.\nAmelia Savell-Boss, ACTED Country Director in Uganda, emphasized that inclusion was at the center of the project, hence the target of 1,500 households, focusing on 66 women.\nFurther preference will be given to households with pregnant and lactating mothers plus children under 24 months.\nIn addition, the activities implemented by ACTED and Caritas Moroto diocese should indirectly benefit 21,000 individuals, based on an estimated average of 700 people per target community.\nThe implemented activities will include access to cash transfer and cash for work for 1,200 highly vulnerable households; enhancing agricultural skills for livelihood and creating vegetable gardens for 1,080 highly vulnerable households; and restoring degraded environment.\nEnvironmental restoration activities will aim to reduce soil erosion, mitigate the effects of climate change, and improve air and water quality.\nOther planned activities will aim at improving the health and well-being of pregnant women and lactating mothers, caregivers, and young children; sharing knowledge about maternal and young child feeding practices and bringing diverse nutritious foods and agricultural input to highly vulnerable households;\nSome money will also go to promoting healthy eating habits in schools and raising awareness of nutritious diets in both households and schools.\nDuring the signing ceremony, Xavier Sticker the French ambassador in Uganda said there had been a long-standing and successful partnership between the French Embassy in Uganda and ACTED.\nThis project is a continuation of actions carried out by ACTED in the recent past and in the same area of intervention, as a continuation of the long-standing and successful partnership with Caritas.\nIn 2018, France financed the REVIVE (Regenerative Earthworks and Vegetation in Vulnerable Ecosystems) project implemented by ACTED, with the creation, in Nakapiripirit, of the REVIVE center, an innovative structure designed to promote regenerative agriculture as well as sustainable resource management and farming among the district’s farmers.\nA second project, financed under the Aid Food Programme 2022 (Strengthening the resilience and nutritional well-being of the communities of Amudat and Nakapiripirit, worth 500,000 euros) was subsequently implemented successfully by a consortium made up of ACTED and the NGO Food for the Hungry.\nIn the current project, Caritas will receive around 40 percent of the budget and will be responsible for activities relating to the dissemination of good food practices in vulnerable households and schools. This will also detect malnutrition and distribute highly nutritious foods.\nThe project selected has the great merit of being a continuation of actions successfully carried out by ACTED, a global NGO with a mission to achieve zero poverty, zero carbo, and zero exclusion, in the recent past and the same area of intervention.\n****\nURN\nShare on: WhatsApp",
