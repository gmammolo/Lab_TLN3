  "text": "A stunning solar halo, known as a \"sun halo,\" is currently visible in the skies over Karachi. Meteorologists attribute this phenomenon to the presence of high-altitude cirrus clouds over the city. These clouds contain ice crystals that scatter sunlight, creating the halo effect observed. What is a solar halo? A solar halo, also referred to as a \"22-degree halo,\" is an optical phenomenon resulting from the refraction of sunlight by millions of hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The halo forms a ring around the sun or moon with a radius of approximately 22 degrees. How Does a solar halo form? These halos are specifically formed by cirrus clouds, which are thin, wispy clouds located at altitudes above 20,000 feet. The ice crystals in these clouds act like prisms and mirrors, reflecting light in specific directions, and creating the halo effect. Why does a solar halo appear? A solar halo occurs when sunlight is refracted by ice crystals. During this process, the halo can sometimes split into different colours. The ice crystals act like prisms, bending and reflecting light in such a way that a ring forms around the sun. Historically, solar halos were used to predict weather before modern meteorological instruments. The appearance of a halo often indicated impending rain within the next 24 hours. What does a solar halo look like? When viewed from the correct angle, a solar halo can resemble a rainbow. Sometimes, it appears as a simple white ring, but it often displays a spectrum of colours. This is the collective reflection of light by the multitude of ice crystals in the atmosphere. The solar halo currently visible in Karachi is a breathtaking display of nature's optical phenomena, captivating residents and providing a rare opportunity to witness this atmospheric wonder.
