  "text": "Founded by Emma Hill in the spring of 2020, Damson Madder is dedicated to transforming the fashion industry with a focus on sustainability and innovation.\nSince its inception, Damson Madder has been dedicated to using eco-friendly materials, incorporating recycled and organic fabrics and natural dyes. By openly sharing information about its materials and manufacturing methods, Damson Madder fosters a sense of trust and connection with its customers. This transparency, combined with their small-batch production model, allows the brand to maintain high quality and sustainability standards.\nOperating from North London, Damson Madder is managed by a passionate, female-led team. The brand releases limited collections, typically comprising 15-35 pieces per drop, a strategy designed to minimize waste and avoid the pitfalls of overproduction. Each piece is thoughtfully crafted 12-18 months ahead to fit and flatter the wearer, incorporating distinctive details that make every item special.\nImage Credit: Damson Madder\nDamson Madder is a Contemporary Brand Championing Sustainable Design\n[Kanesa David](/kanesadavid)— July 19, 2024 — [Fashion](/fashion)\nReferences:\ndamsonmadder\n8.9\nScore\nPopularity\nActivity\nFreshness",
