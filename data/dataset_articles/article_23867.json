  "text": "19 Jul 2024 13:17 Power supply restored to all consumers in Russia's Rostov region - Energy Ministry ROSTOV-ON-DON. July 19 (Interfax) - The temporary outages introduced in Russia's Rostov region have been lifted, and electricity supply has been restored to all consumers, the Energy Ministry said in a statement on its Telegram channel.\n\"System Operator of the United Power System at 8:31 p.m. Moscow time ordered that power supply be resumed to all consumers of Rostovenergo, a branch of Rosseti-South, disconnected in accordance with the temporary outage schedule. Power supply was restored to all consumers at 10:09 p.m. Moscow time,\" the statement said.\nAs reported, temporary outage schedules were introduced in the Rostov region at 11:13 a.m. Moscow time on Thursday due to extreme increases in the air temperature (39 degrees Celsius and higher) and a high load on equipment, especially during daytime.\nTemporary power outage schedules were earlier put in place in southern Russia due to grid overloading. The power supply was later restored.\nPrior to this, temporary power supply restriction schedules were introduced in southern Russia due a power generating equipment malfunction at the Rostov Nuclear Power Plant. The power supply to consumers in southern Russia was later restored.",
