  "text": "India sets a five-year target to lead globally in e-mobility through a comprehensive R&D roadmap focusing on energy storage, electric vehicles, and reducing import dependence In a significant move towards advancing its technological and environmental goals, Professor Ajay Kumar Sood, the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, presented a comprehensive R&D roadmap in New Delhi on July 17. This strategic plan focuses on key areas such as Energy Storage Cells, Electric Vehicle Aggregates, Materials and Recycling, and Charging and Refuelling, with the aim of achieving global leadership and self-reliance in these fields over the next five years. The official launch event attracted a diverse audience, including government officials, members of the Consultative Group on e-Mobility (CGeM), industry representatives, think tank experts, and media personnel. Notable attendees included Dr. Parvinder Maini, Dr. Reji Mathai, and Dr. K. Balasubramanian. Prof. Sood outlined India's ambitious targets: a 45 percent reduction in emission intensity by 2030, energy independence by 2047, and a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2070. He underscored the need for increased adoption of electric vehicles, the development of indigenous energy storage systems, and the expansion of renewable energy sources. Additionally, Prof. Sood highlighted the importance of reducing reliance on imports and enhancing domestic R&D capabilities within the automotive sector. Dr Preeti Banzal, Adviser at the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, emphasised ongoing efforts to build a robust R&D ecosystem in the automotive sector. This includes the formation of the Consultative Group on e-Mobility, tasked with steering India's transition to electric mobility. The Automotive Research Association of India has developed a roadmap document under CGeM’s guidance. Prof. Karthick Athmanathan, PSA Fellow and Professor of Practice at IIT Madras, provided a detailed summary of the e-mobility R&D roadmap. He outlined the specific steps that will be taken to reduce import dependency and achieve energy independence, providing a clear roadmap for India's ambitious e-Mobility targets. The discussions at the event made it clear that the e-mobility R&D roadmap aims to position India as a leader in the global value and supply chains within the next five to seven years, addressing critical gaps in the current research and development framework. Prof. Sood reiterated the need for the automotive sector’s progress to align with the country's Net-Zero vision and the crucial role of fostering a culture of R&D and innovation-driven growth in the industry, given its substantial contribution to India's GDP.",
