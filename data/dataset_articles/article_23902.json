  "text": "Enersponse , a leading distributed energy resource management (DERMs) provider, today announced it has teamed up with Hiveon to offer crypto industry turnkey access to Hiveon Enterprise platform and Enersponse’s automated and fully customizable demand response (DR) programs for a more sustainable, strategic and tailored approach to energy management. As an emerging sector characterized by its power-intensive processes such as cryptographic hashing and blockchain validation, the crypto-mining industry faces significant challenges in managing energy consumption efficiently while maintaining profitability and minimizing impact on the grid. This new partnership provides an automated and seamless solution to this hurdle by integrating Enersponse’s sophisticated DR solutions into Hiveon’s high-performance computing (HPC) management platform—enabling crypto-miners to make more cost-effective energy management decisions while contributing to decarbonization efforts and supporting a more reliable power grid. “With Enersponse’s strong commitment to providing completely customized solutions that meet our customers’ core operational needs without sacrificing performance, integrating our advanced DERMs platform with Hiveon’s leading HPC management solutions was a natural fit,” said James McPhail, chief executive officer of Enersponse. “This synergetic partnership will offer crypto-miners tailored DR solutions that enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs and generate new revenue streams through financial incentives. It also promotes significant energy conservation, making it a highly rewarding venture for our customers and the entire crypto sector.” Hiveon offers a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to enhance operations and maximize profits for enterprise-scale crypto-mining companies by addressing common industry-related complexities such as market fluctuations, hardware instability and human error. By monitoring weather patterns, system outages and energy pricing fluctuations, the integration of Enersponse’s customizable solutions can automatically adjust power utilization in real-time based on pre-set client preferences without the need for human intervention. This offers a simple, convenient and tailored way for Hiveon customers to optimize their energy consumption and easily access utility rebates and other financial incentives—all without compromising the unique requirements of crypto-mining operations. \"Our innovative solutions are designed to bridge the gap between financial and operational performance within the crypto sector by emphasizing unparalleled efficiency and future-ready data utilization—a mission that is perfectly aligned with what Enersponse brings to the table,” added James Jewell, chief executive officer at Hiveon Enterprise. \"Integrating Enersponse's advanced DR solutions into our HPC management platform will provide sustainable and cutting-edge pathways for crypto-miners to unlock new levels of operational efficiency and profitability.” To benefit from this partnership, Hiveon customers simply need to agree to participate—Enersponse does all the legwork.

About Enersponse: https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enersponse.com&esheet=54095860&newsitemid=20240718216855&lan=en-US&anchor=Enersponse&index=5&md5=e19c29a49699ac5f6b68151a73b6e946 is an energy resource management platform that works with power providers across the country to aggregate their distributed energy resource (DER) and rebate programs with clients across the U.S. to maximize financial incentives by automating load reduction responses. This process helps providers maintain a stable grid; saves customers money; earns them passive income through rebates from utilities; and helps achieve corporate social responsibility objectives. The company’s intelligent automation-powered distributed energy resource platform is connected to hundreds of power generators across North America, all dispatchable to customers’ existing control systems. Enersponse’s advanced technology keeps track of what’s happening down to a micro-locational level—even for large enterprises with facilities distributed across multiple power grid providers— by monitoring weather patterns, system outages and energy pricing fluctuations. It then syncs the data collected with pre-set client preferences to intelligently adjust power use in real-time without the need for human intervention. This means less stress on internal resources and an automated one-stop-shop solution for consolidating all available energy conservation programs to maximize cost savings—ultimately paying customers and their control companies to save power. About Hiveon Enterprise Hiveon Enterprise is a profit-focused HPC management platform designed for enterprise-scale mining companies. It offers a suite of solutions to enhance operational efficiency and maximize profits, including a comprehensive data platform, AI insights, energy programs and advanced technical support.
