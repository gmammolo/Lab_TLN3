  "text": "Mid-July rains in São Paulo, Brazil, have provided relief to citrus growers, particularly in the south and southwest regions, after a prolonged dry spell. While the rainfall was uneven across different areas, it was more pronounced in the southwest, potentially triggering the blossoming of flowers. However, in less fortunate areas where rainfall was sparse or absent, additional humidity is still needed for blossoming to occur. The recent rainfall, although beneficial, is not expected to immediately boost Tahiti lime supply, but it may positively impact harvest quality and volume in the upcoming weeks. Meanwhile, Brazilian orange juice exports have seen a decline in the 2023/24 season, with a 8.1% decrease in volume to 1 million tons, despite a 25% increase in revenue, reaching USD 2.7 billion. This downturn is attributed to reduced juice stock levels within the country. In terms of processing, São Paulo's orange processing pace remains brisk, with some industry insiders noting a more advanced crushing season. While last year's processing concluded in the latter half of September, expectations for the 2024/25 season anticipate an earlier end in July or August.
