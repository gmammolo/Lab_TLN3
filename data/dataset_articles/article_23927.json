  "text": "Event focused on reducing emissions and building climate resilience in East of England Over 250 people attended a summit focused on the actions needed to achieve net zero and climate resilience for the East of England. The East of England Net Zero and Climate Change Resilience conference took place at Anglia Ruskin University's Cambridge campus, and was opened by Daniel Zeichner MP as one of his first engagements as Minister of State for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Mr Zeichner, in his opening address, set out the essential need for adaptation to a changing climate. A commitment to farming and farmers as custodians of the natural environment was highlighted, as was DEFRA's commitment to cleaning up rivers, lakes and seas, boosting food security, ensuring nature recovery and protecting people from flooding. He was followed by a programme that included a wide range of influential speakers and workshop discussions covering the most important climate change themes for the region. As part of the event, a groundbreaking report showcasing the economic potential of the East of England was launched. 'Opportunity East: How the East of England will drive national productivity through innovation' was produced by the East of England LGA (EELGA), Chambers East and the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the region. It states that the East of England could become a £220 billion economy by 2035 and has the potential to go even further. This growth would be led by sectors essential to achieving net zero and mitigation including green energy, agri-tech and advanced manufacturing, but this is at significant risk due to historic underinvestment in the region's infrastructure. ARU showcased several sustainable research projects that are taking place across the region. Manoj Dora , Professor in Sustainable Production and Consumption at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), said: Councillor Peter Schwier, Chair of the Regional Climate Change Forum said: Alongside highlighting the opportunities offered by the East of England in supporting the new Government to meet its manifesto pledges, and creating national economic prosperity, the report calls for greater investment and support for the region's transport, water, energy and digital infrastructure. The East of England Net Zero and Climate Resilience Summit was organised by the East of England LGA, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, and sub-national transport bodies Transport East and England's Economic Heartland.
