  "text": "The Department of Energy is ponying up more money to boost solar power in Puerto Rico, announcing on Thursday a $861 million loan guarantee and the opening of a $325 million grant program. The [loan guarantee](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-clean-flexible-energy-build-utility-scale-solar?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery), if finalized, would go to Clean Flexible Energy to build 200 megawatts of solar and up to 285 MW of batteries — enough to power 43,000 Puerto Rican homes. DOE also launched a separate grant program that aims to fund the installation of solar power and batteries at community health care facilities and in housing complexes. The project from Clean Flexible Energy, dubbed Project Marahu, will harden the Puerto Rican grid, reduce electricity prices and help the territory meet “its ambitious clean energy and climate goals,” said DOE Loan Programs Office Director Jigar Shah. “The project will support the retirement of fossil fuel power plants reliant on imported fuel, increase renewable energy generation, and enhance grid resilience — we’re excited to be a part of this important work,” Shah said in a statement to E&E News.",
