Companies covered: ADAMA Ltd, Bayer AG, ChemChina, Corteva, Evogene Ltd., KWS SAAT SE & Co., KGaA, Limagrain, Marrone Bio Innovations, MITSUI & CO., Nufarm, Performance plants Inc., Valent BioSciences LLC, and Other key vendors.\nNew York, United States, July 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Global Agricultural Biotechnology Market Size is to Grow from USD 121.24 Billion in 2023 to USD 268.32 Billion by 2033, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.27% during the projected period.\nGet a Sample PDF Brochure:\nAgricultural biotechnology is a specialized branch of biotechnology that uses scientific methods to apply scientific principles to enhance agricultural practices. improving crop yields, pest resistance, and lowering reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides are all obtained through the administration of living things, including plants, animals, and microbes. Focusing on addressing some of the most urgent problems, including food security and sustainable agriculture, agricultural biotechnology uses technologies like genetic engineering, tissue culture, and molecular diagnostics to generate more prosperous, nutrient-dense, and abundant crops. Farmer productivity increases with reduced inputs due to modern biotechnology. The global need for more agricultural yields and sustainable farming methods is the main factor conditioning the global market. Furthermore, by using scientific methods to modify and improve the characteristics of plants, animals, and microbes, biotechnology acts as a catalyst to boost the value of these living things. An important subset of biotechnology called agricultural biotechnology is concerned with improving agricultural methods and results. Genetic engineering technologies represent a revolutionary frontier in agricultural innovation, even if traditional techniques like selection and breeding have long been used to develop agriculturally significant species. Furthermore, However, agricultural biotechnology is being implemented. determining its potential effects on the environment and public health is therefore difficult.\nBrowse key industry insights spread across 213 pages with 110 Market data tables and figures & charts from the \" Global Agricultural Biotechnology Market Size, Share, and COVID-19 Impact Analysis, By Organism Type (Plants, Animals, and Microbes), By Technology (Genetic Engineering, Molecular Breeding, Molecular Diagnostics, and Tissue Culture), By Application (Vaccine Development, Transgenic Crops & Animals, Antibiotic Development, Nutritional Supplements, and Biofuels), and By Region (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa), Analysis and Forecast 2023 – 2033.\"\nBuy Now Full Report:\nThe plants segment is anticipated to hold the greatest share of the global agricultural biotechnology market during the projected timeframe.\nBased on the organism type, the global agricultural biotechnology market is divided into plants, animals, and microbes .
