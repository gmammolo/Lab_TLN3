  "text": "Ellenbrook locals are well aware their master planned community is often derisively referred to by the nickname Felonbrook, a reflection of growing concerns over crime in the area.\nNow an increase in issues there has prompted the formation of a working group, bringing together local schools, shopping centre management, law enforcement, and political leaders to address it.\nThe incident allegedly happened at Ellenbrook Central.\nThe move comes after a 14-year-old boy was allegedly coward punched and stomped on by a fellow student from Aveley Secondary College while at Ellenbrook Central shopping centre after school on April 2.\nThe incident left the boy with a broken jaw that required surgery and suffering from seizures. He remains in hospital as doctors investigate whether he has been left with any lasting cognitive damage .\nPolice arrested a 15-year-old boy and charged him with one count of ‘Acts intended to cause harm or endanger the life, health or safety of any person’ but he was released on bail until a court appearance later this month.\nThe decision to release him has angered the community who say a tougher stance must be taken with minors terrorising the local area.\nA petition has amassed more than 1000 signatures and locals are considering a protest as they demand a “crackdown” on bullying and violence.\n“We as a community have had enough of this bullying and intimidating behaviour in our suburb and action is needed immediately,” petition author Sharon Moore said.\n“Children are being excessively bullied, assaulted and mugged daily on buses, in shopping centres, even just randomly in the street.\nAdvertisement “The kids doing this are often repeat offenders, that are known to police, but do not care, as they know even if the police arrest them the court system will let them go.”\nMoore said it wasn’t just children dealing with the “thugs”, it was teachers, doctors, nurses, police officers, security guards, shop workers who were also getting spat on, hit, kicked and verbally assaulted.\nShe said they were powerless to act.\n“Kids are regularly jumping in front of cars at night and then abusing the drivers if they react, damaging their car or threatening them,” she said.\n“This disgusting, harmful, frightening and unacceptable behaviour should not, under any circumstances be tolerated, let alone be the norm.”\nCrime in Ellenbrook rose by 16 per cent last year and is now at a 10-year-high.\nOn Tuesday WA’s deputy premier Rita Saffioti said she, Swan Hills member Michelle Maynard and education minister Sabine Winton had been in talks with shopping centre management and police minister Reece Whitby, about the problem.\nThe boys involved in the alleged assault were from Aveley Secondary College. Credit: Facebook\n“We are creating a working group which has both involvement of the schools and, of course, the shopping centre and the local police to oversee what are some issues in relation to basically, young kids going to the shopping centre after school,” Saffioti said.\n“We’ve asked for more police presence at the shopping centre after school to try and de-escalate the current issues and tension that’s in there.”\nShe said the group was planning to support principals but said it was sometimes issues that would begin at school that “flowed over into the shopping centre”.\nMichelle Maynard told WAtoday she met with local high school principals, the Department of Education, WA Police, and retailers on Monday and agreed to a coordinated approach to identify and address bad behaviour.\n“We believe that with a coordinated approach from all parties our young people will soon be reminded of what is expected of them.”\nOn Wednesday WA Premier Roger Cook labelled the spate of violent incidents at the high school as “distressing and traumatising”.\nIt followed a second parent coming forward and alleging her 13-year-old son was horrifically bullied at the school, which forced her to remove him due to concerns for his mental health.\nCook said he understood that parents, who were calling for schools to better protect their children, were upset.\n“Kids should be confident that they can go to school knowing that they’ll be protected, knowing that they’ll be supervised to the extent needed so that violence doesn’t occur,” he said.\n“We can’t guarantee that there won’t be outbreaks of anti-social behaviour in a school environment, and that’s why we have such strong consequences for students that are enacting out violence.“\nCook said 10 alternative school sites had been arranged for other disruptive students, with options available for schools to address ongoing bullies.\nSince the alleged assault at Ellenbrook Central a week ago, large groups of school children are no longer permitted to enter the centre at the same time.\nA spokesperson for Vicinity, which operates the centre said security teams follow “carefully planned” patrol rotations to ensure comprehensive coverage.\nLoading “Ellenbrook Shopping Centre has a zero tolerance policy on disruptive and aggressive behaviour. We continue to work closely with local schools, our retail partners and WAPOL to deliver a coordinated response to these issues in order to create a safe and a welcoming environment at our centre.”\nWA Police said they could not comment on whether more patrols had been sent to cover the area but said that police resources were “scaled up or down to meet operational demand as required”.\nStart the day with a summary of the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
