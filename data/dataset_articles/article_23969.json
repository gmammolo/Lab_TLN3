  "text": "Italian luxury furniture maker B&B Italia and British sustainable fashion pioneer, Stella McCartney have unveiled a special edition “Camaleonda” sofa, marking the two’s second collaboration to date. This partnership, born from McCartney’s admiration for Mario Bellini ‘s work, began in 2022 with the “Le Bambole” armchair.\nThe iconic Bellini’s design now features McCartney’s S-Wave monogram, inspired by natural elements and symbolizing the brand’s commitment to sustainability. The new “Camaleonda”, crafted from nearly entirely sustainable materials, showcases B&B Italia’s R&D innovation. Its upholstery uses OceanSafe naNea yarn, which is biodegradable, Cradle to Cradle Certified Gold and free from harmful substances. This material also performs like conventional fabrics all without shedding microplastics.\nOffered in soft, muted pink and beige tones, the sofa exudes a serene and comfortable aesthetic. Its modular design allows for creative rearrangement of arms, back pillows, and seats, enabling users to mix and match colors for a personalized look.\nThe collaboration debuts at COLOURLIVING’s Hong Kong showroom and will be showcased at Art Basel Miami Beach on December 6 as part of an installation at B&B Italia Design Studio’s grand opening.
