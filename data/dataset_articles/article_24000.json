  "text": "Gardeners dread the sight of slugs and snails wreaking havoc on their carefully tended plants. These soft-bodied pests are notorious for their nocturnal activities, emerging under the cover of darkness to feast on garden greenery. TV gardener David Domoney recently shared his top tips for keeping gardens slug and snail-free on ITV's This Morning. While acknowledging that these creatures do have some benefits for gardens, he also highlighted the damage they can cause. According to Domoney, it's the moisture in gardens that attracts these pests, so he advises against watering plants late at night. Instead, he suggests watering in the late afternoon, allowing the sun to dry the ground first. Interestingly, the trails left behind by slugs and snails serve as a form of communication and navigation for them. To disrupt this, Domoney recommends using a mixture of vinegar and water in a spray bottle to clear their trails. Vinegar is a popular natural pest repellent used both indoors and outdoors. However, its acidity can be harmful to plants, so it should only be sprayed on slugs that haven't reached your plants yet, reports the Express . As a common household item, vinegar is not only effective but also affordable, with white vinegar priced at 35p in Sainsbury's and Tesco . David also mentioned that traps can be \"pretty good\". Garden enthusiasts can purchase specific slug traps or simply utilise a plastic container. To employ this technique, just bury them in the ground with some beer poured in and the slugs and snails will fall into them, allowing you to safely release them afterwards. Barriers can also be used to deter slugs, David prefers using crushed eggshells because \"slugs don't like crawling over it due to it's sharp texture\". Alternatively, plants with fragrant leaves are something slugs \"don't like\". These plants include chives, onions, lavender and rosemary.",
