This initiative, designed to kickstart the next generation of astrophysics missions, seeks to deepen our understanding of essential cosmic phenomena. Mission Proposal Overview Two notable proposals have emerged from this initiative, each receiving up to $5 million for detailed mission concept studies that will last one year. These studies are integral for establishing feasibility and outlining scientific objectives that align with pressing astrophysical challenges. Following these assessments, one pioneering concept will be selected by NASA in 2026, preparing for a launch that aims for 2032. The Probe Explorers Initiative This selection marks the introduction of a new mission class called Probe Explorers within NASA's renowned Explorers Program. The Probe Explorers are designed to bridge the gap between the larger flagship missions and smaller undertakings, allowing for a broader range of scientific inquiries. Expectations from the Selected Concepts The selected proposals are expected to not only advance our scientific knowledge but also develop essential technologies that could be pivotal for future flagship missions. These concepts hold the potential to address top astrophysical priorities and engage the wider scientific community in using the new observatory for collaborative research. Key Contributions from the National Academies A noteworthy recommendation from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine paves the way for these explorations. Their 2020 Decadal Survey, dubbed \"Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s,\" urged NASA to establish this new class primarily focused on observing X-ray or far-infrared wavelengths. Capping mission costs at $1 billion ensures strategic allocation of resources while promoting the advancement of significant scientific inquiries. Focus of the Selected Proposals The two selected mission proposals include: Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite This mission focuses on launching an advanced X-ray imaging observatory that promises to deliver high spatial resolution and a wide field-of-view. Its objectives include scrutinizing the beginnings of supermassive black holes, understanding stellar feedback processes that mold galaxy evolution, and unearthing energy sources behind various cosmic explosions. It aspires to build on the achievements of past X-ray observatories while enhancing capabilities essential for X-ray imaging. Leading this ground-breaking project is Principal Investigator Christopher Reynolds from the University of Maryland, College Park, with the project management handled by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Probe Far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics The second proposal features a 1.8-meter telescope dedicated to studying far-infrared wavelengths, aimed at filling gaps between existing infrared and radio telescopes. This mission seeks to unpack the origins of planets, supermassive black holes, stars, and cosmic dust by analyzing radiant energy in the far-infrared spectrum. Lead by Principal Investigator Jason Glenn at NASA Goddard, project management is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Legacy of the Explorers Program The Explorers Program, regarded as the oldest ongoing NASA initiative, has been pivotal in offering consistent and cost-efficient access to space. Since the historic launch of Explorer 1 in 1958, this program has facilitated over 90 missions, enhancing our universal knowledge and recognition in the field of science. Notable missions include the Uhuru and Cosmic Background Explorer, both recognized with prestigious awards for their contributions to astrophysics. Future Perspectives in Astrophysics NASA Goddard manages the Explorers Program in alignment with the Science Mission Directorate, which focuses on a myriad of research initiatives regarding Earth sciences, space weather, and explorations of the solar system and beyond. As science rapidly evolves, the upcoming missions promise to unveil more in our cosmos and engage a broader scientific community. Frequently Asked Questions What are the main goals of the new NASA missions? The main goals include studying X-ray and far-infrared wavelengths of light to uncover cosmic phenomena and enhance technologies for future missions. Who is managing the selected mission proposals? The selected mission proposals are managed by key institutions like NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. When will the selected mission concepts launch? NASA aims to select one of the proposed concepts by 2026, with a targeted launch date in 2032. How has the Explorers Program impacted space science? The Explorers Program has significantly advanced space science by providing low-cost access and facilitating over 90 missions since its inception. What technologies will the new missions develop? The new missions are expected to develop key technologies that can be utilized in future large-scale NASA missions.
