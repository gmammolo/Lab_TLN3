The company is expanding its collaborative coffee innovation network, which aims to connect farmers from diverse global regions with the resources they need. This initiative builds on the pioneering agronomy innovation established at Hacienda Alsacia, Starbucks' first company-operated coffee farm. The addition of new farms in Guatemala and Costa Rica, along with future plans for investment in Africa and Asia, emphasizes the company’s commitment to global coffee sustainability. Collaborating for a Sustainable Vision Michelle Burns, the Executive Vice President of Global Coffee and Sustainability at Starbucks, highlighted the company's support for over 450,000 farms producing premium Arabica coffee. Starbucks’ dedication to these farmers and their communities speaks volumes about its commitment to a sustainable coffee future. The company’s strategy revolves around developing on-farm interventions, sharing seeds, and disseminating research and practices to help coffee producers address the effects of climate change. Challenges Facing Coffee Production Starbucks plays a vital role in the coffee industry by sourcing an impressive three percent of the world's coffee solely from Arabica beans. However, climate change poses significant threats, affecting the availability and quality of coffee globally. Challenges such as rising temperatures, drought, and diseases like coffee leaf rust are negatively impacting productivity and the livelihoods of farmers. Starbucks recognizes these challenges and is taking proactive steps to mitigate their effects. Innovating for the Future At Hacienda Alsacia, efforts are underway to counteract climate change's impact. Best practices have been developed to enhance profitability for coffee growers while producing the next generation of disease-resistant coffee varieties. As part of their commitment, Starbucks has undertaken the distribution of climate-friendly coffee trees, with nearly 90 million trees distributed to date, in line with their goal of reaching 100 million by 2025. The establishment of additional coffee innovation farms will further advance research capabilities and address climate threats more effectively. Research and Development Across the Coffee Belt The newly established farms in Costa Rica and Guatemala are expected to explore hybrid coffee varieties, focusing on different elevations and soil conditions. These farms will also leverage modern technologies, including mechanization and drones, to tackle labor shortages experienced by farmers in LatAm. The efforts in Guatemala are particularly pivotal as they replicate conditions faced by smallholder farmers, ensuring that effective solutions are developed for real-world challenges. Global Investment in Coffee Innovation Starbucks is committed to further investments across Africa and Asia, thereby establishing a broad coffee innovation network that spans the three primary coffee-growing regions: Latin America, Africa, and Asia Pacific. This diverse network will allow Starbucks to study various cultural practices, landscapes, and farming methods, all of which contribute to the exquisite flavors of coffee. Research emanating from these innovation farms will be reinforced by Starbucks' existing Farmer Support Centers and model farms, enabling practical applications of new knowledge. Continuous Learning and Support Through a comprehensive approach that includes sustainability learning labs, Starbucks aims to foster ongoing innovation and education among coffee farmers. These initiatives are essential for enhancing coffee productivity and quality while equipping farmers with the requisite knowledge and tools necessary to adapt to evolving climatic conditions. Final Thoughts on Coffee Sustainability As Starbucks forges ahead with its coffee innovation farms, the vision is clear: create a sustainable future for coffee cultivation everywhere. This transformative journey not only seeks to enhance the quality and quantity of coffee but also empowers farmers on multiple fronts—socio-economically and environmentally.
