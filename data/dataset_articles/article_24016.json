  "text": "Purcellville is working to upgrade its water treatment plant along Short Hill Road and received approval from the county Planning Commission last week. The site currently houses a 1,000-gallon ground-mounted water storage tank, and equipment to treat water from the town reservoir and a groundwater well. The town is requesting a commission permit to allow a major utility, a special exception to expand the existing facility, and minor special exception to eliminate the landscape buffer requirements. The property is surrounded by nutrient bank tree plantings located in a conservation easement. IMEG Engineering Consultant Jason Alagna said the town is looking to expand the facility to help provide more water to the town’s system. The project is included in the town’s fiscal year 2025-2029 Capital Improvement Program in three phases and is expected to cost $3 million. Completion of the project estimated for late 2028. The commission voted unanimously to approve to the application during its Sept. 24 meeting.",
