  "text": "Semiconductor technology is constantly in search of stronger, more efficient and more durable materials. This search has led scientists to one of nature’s hardest and most precious materials: diamond. Accordingly, diamond has the potential to revolutionize the semiconductor industry.\nDiamond could revolutionize semiconductor technology\nDiamond is attracting attention in the world of electronics thanks to its hardness and thermal conductivity. Diamond-based power devices, which can offer 10 times more performance compared to standard silicon semiconductors, are getting closer to commercialization thanks to Japan-based developments.\nAt the component level, diamond can handle about 50,000 times more electricity than silicon. It can also operate at five times higher temperatures. This makes it indispensable for applications that require large power supplies, such as electric vehicles, airplanes, power grids and nuclear power plants.\nThe fact that diamond is a difficult material to process posed significant technological obstacles in the production of electronics-grade substrates. But Japanese companies have made great progress in this field. Last year, Saga University produced the world’s first diamond-based power circuit. And Orbray paved the way for mass production of 2-inch diamond chips.\nIn 2024, the momentum continues. Power Diamond Systems introduced diamond hardware capable of handling 6.8 amps of current. It also aims to start commercial shipments in a few years. And Ookuma Diamond Device is building a factory to produce diamond semiconductors from 2026.\nExperts predict that diamond-based microprocessors will complete the transition from the lab to the market between 2025 and 2030. Companies manufacturing synthetic diamonds and semiconductor equipment will benefit from this growth as they move closer to commercial use.",
