  "text": "If you missed the Northern Lights in September there’s another chance to catch them! Try to stay up late if you can tonight, October 3rd and tomorrow, October 4th as the Aurora Borealis could be visible from Toronto.\nWhat’s happening? If the weather holds up, Toronto could get an overhead view of the Northern Lights!\nAccording to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, “High(+) aurora activity forecasted. If skies are clear, highly active auroral displays may be visible overhead from locations such as Inuvik, Yellowknife, Rankin and Iqaluit, Canada, to Vancouver, Helena, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Bay City, Toronto and Montpelier, U.S.A., and Charlottetown, Canada; and may be visible low on the horizon from Salem, Boise, Cheyenne, Lincoln, Indianapolis and Annapolis, U.S.A..”\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), states that a storm watch is issued tonight with a G1 rating meaning the aurora will be moderate, today, October 3rd a G3 storm is issued (active) and on October 4th another G2 storm (moderate).\nHow intense will they be? Active Region 3842 produces another (R3 – Strong) solar flare, an X9.0 at 1218 UTC on October 3rd, 2024.\nStay Tuned to https://t.co/YLUbTRM02y for the latest updates! pic.twitter.com/0b0GR5xEY7\n— NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (@NWSSWPC) October 3, 2024\nBased on the Kp number system that Alaska Fairbanks University uses to measure the aurora strength – 0 being calm to 9 being a major geomagnetic storm with strong auroras visible, tonight, October 3rd and tomorrow October 4th will peak at a Kp 7 into Saturday.\nWhat are the best times to watch for auroras? According to the University of Alaska , “the best time to watch for the aurora is the three or four hours centred around midnight.”\nWhere can I see them? The downtown core won’t be the best spot to see the Northern Lights because of light pollution so you’ll want to get a little outside of the city.\nThe closest Ontario Dark Sky Preserves near Toronto include Point Pelee National Park, Torrance Barrens Conservation Reserve and Point Pelee National Park – these will be your best bet for catching a great view!\nWeather According to Environment Canada, the weather in Toronto is calling for a chance of showers tonight, October 3rd and clear skies tomorrow, October 4th so tomorrow may be your best bet!\nWill you be checking out the Northern Lights, Toronto?\nRecent Posts:\nLionel Messi could play in Toronto this weekend & tickets are still available\nCanada’s first & largest pickle festival is coming to Toronto",
