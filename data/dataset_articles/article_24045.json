  "text": "Local elected officials and Con Edison representatives gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony to mark the launch of the energy company’s billion-dollar clean energy project in Southeast Queens.\nCon Edison Chairman and CEO Tim Cawley, joined by Vice President LaAsia Hundley, Assembly Member Clyde Vanel, Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr., and MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber, participated in the event at the project site located at 109-48 180th St. on Monday, Oct. 1.\nThe $1.2 billion initiative will modernize the electric grid in Southeast Queens by constructing two new substations and establishing a new Springfield electric network to support the area’s growing energy needs. The project, known as the Reliable Clean City-Idlewild Project, aims to deliver clean energy to homes, businesses, and major transportation hubs in the region.\nThe project will support the electrification of JFK Airport, the MTA’s transition to electric buses, and the electrification of buildings in Jamaica, Queens. It is expected to generate over 400 skilled union jobs, facilitate contracts for Minority and Women-Owned Businesses (MWBE), and contribute to New York State’s climate goals. The Reliable Clean City-Idlewild Project is one of two substations being built to enhance the electric grid in Southeast Queens.\nPhotographed on Sept. 16th, 2024, the Idlewild Project is a $1.2 billion investment to modernize the electric grid in Southeast Queens by creating two new substations and a new Springfield electric network to meet the growth in demand in the area.

The Reliable Clean City – Idlewild Project will improve the electric grid in Southeast Queens, support the electrification of MTA bus depots and fleets, and ensure we are better prepared to face increasingly common extreme weather events,” Powers said.",
