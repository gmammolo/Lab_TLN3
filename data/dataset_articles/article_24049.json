This mutual assistance embodies the spirit of solidarity that prevails in the utility industry. Massive Response to Hurricane Helene's Destruction The coordinated response will see PG&E workers departing from California, ready to collaborate with other utility personnel across North America. With over 300 trucks being sent, the scale of this operation speaks to the significant challenge of restoring power to thousands left in darkness. Impact of Hurricane Helene As a Category 4 hurricane, Helene wrought catastrophic effects after making landfall. It swept across multiple states, including Georgia, South and North Carolina, plunging over 900,000 residents into darkness. This hurricane is reportedly the deadliest in five decades, claiming numerous lives and displacing many more. PG&E stands with the affected communities during this challenging time. Collaboration Across Utility Sectors Angie Gibson, PG&E's Vice President of Emergency Preparedness & Response, underscored the importance of mutual aid among utility companies, stating, \"When the chips are down, we start our crews and blue trucks rolling to help. And other companies do the same for us when we need assistance.\" This cooperation is vital for efficient disaster response. Recent Mutual Aid Highlights In the past few years, PG&E has exemplified its commitment to cooperative support. For example, they assisted Pacific Power in August 2023 during the Smith River Complex Fires, providing both personnel and crucial equipment. Similar efforts were made in 2018 when PG&E traveled to Massachusetts to support local utility efforts after devastating explosions. Efforts During Previous Disasters Historically, PG&E's involvement extends to major hurricane recovery efforts, including deployments after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and Hurricane Irma in Florida. These extensive recovery missions highlight PG&E's expertise and readiness to respond to various natural disasters. Supporting a Nationwide Response As organizations rally together during Hurricane Helene's aftermath, the Edison Electric Institute reported an astounding 50,000 workers from at least 40 states and Canada are involved in this emergency response. PG&E's contribution is remarkably significant among this vast network, showcasing the united front of utility companies. Power Restoration Progress With nearly 6 million customers initially impacted by Hurricane Helene, progress is being made as approximately 4.51 million have seen their power restored. This diligent work underlines the commitment from all involved to expedite recovery efforts and assist affected communities effectively. Conclusion: A Heartfelt Commitment PG&E's Senior Vice President of Electric Operations, Peter Kenny, expressed empathy for the victims of Hurricane Helene, reflecting on the devastation caused. He voices gratitude for those who serve, emphasizing the relentless nature of support—both in Georgia and California. PG&E remains dedicated to restoring power and offering aid where it is most needed. Frequently Asked Questions What is the primary purpose of PG&E's deployment?
