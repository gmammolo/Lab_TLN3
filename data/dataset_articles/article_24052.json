  "text": "Andrew Tonnies, policy associate, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or 402.590.7096; or Rhea Landholm, communications manager, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or 402.687.2100 ext. 1025 LYONS - The Center for Rural Affairs is seeking participants for its Conservation Mentorship Network, a program designed to foster peer-to-peer learning among farmers and ranchers and increase the number of conservation practices adopted across Nebraska. The network will create opportunities for participants to learn in individual and large-group settings. In addition to attending field days, webinars, and small group discussions, participants may request one-on-one guidance from a mentor whose location, operation, and values reflect their own. “When it comes to new farming methods, producers often turn to their peers for help or information they can trust,” said Andrew Tonnies, policy associate for the Center. “Implementing conservation practices is no exception.” The Center has recruited mentors from across the state to assist with network discussions and activities. “Our mentors are excited to share their experiences using conservation methods to increase the resiliency of their operations,” Tonnies said. He said the group represents an array of farm and ranch operations; however, all of them believe that helping their peers be successful is essential to the continued progress of agriculture. “Sometimes you get hung up and just need someone to talk to [who can] help you figure things out,” said Teresa Otte, a mentor based near David City. “If I can encourage anyone to participate and get back to a little more conservation, it's going to be good for everyone. It means cleaner water and more productive soil that benefits rural communities.” Participants must be located in Nebraska and express an interest in the on-farm benefits of conservation practices despite the associated challenges and risks. Producers with any level of experience and operation size (rented or owned land) are welcome to join, as well as those who have conservation experience and an interest in expanding their portfolio. “What’s important in the long run is that producers band together to implement good practices for soil health, water quality, and their bottom lines,” Tonnies said. “The Conservation Mentorship Network is one important step toward that goal.” Interested farmers and ranchers are encouraged to visit [cfra.org/conservationmentorshipnetwork](/conservationmentorshipnetwork) or email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) before Dec. 1 to sign up. Mentors enrolled in the program include: - Bassett - Homer Buell - Brownville - Daryl Obermeyer - Chadron - Ron Bolze - David City - Teresa Otte - Denton - Brian Brhel - Elsie - Vance McCoy - Filley - Riley Reinke - Fremont - Chad Christianson - Hardy - Will Corman - Heartwell - Rob Hultquist - Indianola - Tracy Zink - Martell - Alex McKiernan - Mead - Angela Knuth - Milligan - Jordan Uldrich - Monroe - Greg Keller - Palmyra - Mike McDonald - Pierce - Dan Stelling - Pilger - Zeke Brummels - Rockville - Chris Trumler - Schuyler - Matt Bailey - Scribner - Ruth Ready - Utica - Alex Daake - Winside - Scott Heinemann The Conservation Mentorship Network is made possible through funding from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, General Mills, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. # # #",
