  "text": "For the fifth consecutive time since its formation in 2018, SCV Water has been recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a WaterSense Excellence Award. “It is a tremendous honor to win our fifth WaterSense Excellence Award in the last five years,” said [SCV Water](https://www.yourscvwater.com/) Sustainability Manager Matt Dickens. “This is a huge honor for our conservation team, the Agency, and the community as it recognizes the amazing work that all of us have done to support and enhance sustainable water use in the Santa Clarita Valley.” SCV Water was presented with a WaterSense Excellence in Education and Outreach award recognizing many of the programs and projects spearheaded by the Agency. In recognition of its commitment to promoting WaterSense and water efficiency in 2023, SCV Water was honored in a ceremony during the WaterSmart Innovations (WSI) Conference in Las Vegas on September 26, 2024, alongside more than 50 other awardees – utilities, manufacturers, builders, retailers and other organizations that partner with WaterSense to promote water-efficient products, homes and programs. “EPA is recognizing these WaterSense award winners who are helping protect our water resources while improving energy efficiency, saving customers’ money, and advancing efforts to manage climate change impacts like water scarcity and drought,” said EPA Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water Bruno Pigott in a news release. For its fifth WaterSense Excellence Award, SCV Water implemented several programs and projects to assist the community and its customers with their water conservation goals. In collaboration with the City of Santa Clarita, SCV Water developed the Bridgeport Park Sustainable Landscape Demonstration Garden to promote sustainable landscapes and provide outdoor learning for local students. Further, SCV Water partnered with the University of Southern California’s Dornsife Public Exchange to study water usage awareness among residents. Findings revealed a lack of awareness and action on water conservation, prompting SCV Water to enhance engagement and remove barriers. SCV Water also continued its WaterSMART Workshop, an online e-learning module, reaching over 125 participants. Additionally, the Agency produced educational videos on fixing household leaks and promoting the Lawn Replacement Program. Ed. Note: The above information was provided to KHTS Radio by SCV Water.
