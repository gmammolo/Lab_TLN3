  "text": "CHELMSFORD - Gov. Maura Healey has issued a special permit allowing a beaver to stay at a Massachusetts rescue facility after MassWildlife said she had to be released into the wild.\nThe beaver, named Nibi , has captured the hearts of many people in Massachusetts and around the country. She was found orphaned in Sturbridge two years ago by Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, who have cared for her since.\n\"I think this meant a lot to people. I think that Nibi stands for more than just, she's not just a beaver. She's an innocent animal in all of this and there's a lot of respect and love for wildlife,\" Jane Newhouse said in a video posted on the group's Facebook page. \"There's a lot of empathy for animals that can't speak for themselves.\"\nMassWildlife initially said Nibi had to return to the wild and Newhouse disagreed, saying Nibi would die and that she should remain with the rescue as an educational animal. A judge issued an order on Tuesday, preventing MassWildlife temporarily from taking the beaver.\nGovernor hopes Nibi inspires people \"Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,\" said Healey in a statement. \"We're excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse's care, continuing to educate the public about this important species. I'm grateful to our state's dedicated wildlife biologists who work every day to care for Massachusetts wildlife, and I hope Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.\"\nA Change.org petition calling for Nibi to remain with Newhouse got more than 30,000 signatures.\nMore from CBS News Child found safe after allegedly being kidnapped by father from daycare Dog owners warned about shark sightings near popular beach Free community college in Mass. expected to draw thousands Treasure hunt trophy found in Massachusetts, but who won?
