  "text": "As part of the Tasmanian Government's ongoing commitment to support and grow freshwater angling participation, the Inland Fisheries Service (IFS) has tagged and released 16 brown trout, each valued at $5,000, into nine lakes across the state. Minister for Business, Industry and Resources, Eric Abetz, said encouraging recreational fishing is part of the government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. \"We know from the newly-released IMAS recreational fishing survey that more than one in four Tasmanians, or more than 130,000 people, go fishing around our coastline and on inland waters.\" \"Last year Tasmania's world-class inland fishery attracted over 26,000 licensed anglers and generated considerable economic activity in regional areas. We want to encourage participation and enjoyment of this great outdoor pursuit. Tagged brown trout have been stocked into the following lakes: * Lake Mackintosh * Lake Rowallan * Hunstman Lake * Lake Leake * yingina / Great Lake * Bradys Lake * Arthurs Lake * Lake Sorell * Craigbourne Lake. To claim a prize, anglers will need to catch a brown trout with the correct tag and report the details of the catch, with photo evidence, to the IFS. Fish caught in the Tagged Trout Promotion must be kept with tag intact for verification. The promotion starts on 5 October 2024. Entry to the Tasmanian Tagged Trout Promotion is open to holders of a current freshwater angling licence or persons aged under 14 who have the permission of their parent or guardian. This season, angling licences for junior anglers aged between 14 and 17 years of age continue to be free, and the IFS is also offering discounted licences for 18 to 21-year-olds to further encourage the next generation of anglers to enjoy our inland fishery. For those that have never given trout fishing a go, this is a wonderful opportunity to get out into the great outdoors, have a great time and try your luck at catching a $5000 prize.
