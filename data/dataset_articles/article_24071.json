  "text": "EAST ST. LOUIS (WGEM) - Illinois state parks are getting a new addition, electric vehicles chargers. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker joined state lawmakers and leaders from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Thursday at Frank Holten State Park in East St. Louis to announce the IDNR will be installing 40 chargers at state parks, historic sites, museums, beaches and other widely used public areas. Electric mobility company EVBox donated the 40 chargers. The company’s North American headquarters are based in Libertyville , a Chicago suburb. Pritzker said people can use the chargers for free. It’s all part of a larger push to get more electric vehicles on Illinois roads. Pritzker estimates there are about 120,000 registered EVs in Illinois. The goal is to get that number to one million by 2030. “The most critical need on our way to that goal is building the charging infrastructure to make electric vehicles as convenient and accessible as any other car,” Pritzker said. The Department of Natural Resources has already installed chargers at four state parks: Frank Holden State Park, Eldon Hazlet State Recreation Area near Carlyle, Washington County State Recreation Area near Nashville and Jim Edgar Panther Creek State Fish and Wildlife Area in Cass County.
