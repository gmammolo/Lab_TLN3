  "text": "In a world where sustainability meets style, cycling brands are finding creative ways to merge the two. The latest collaboration between Thousand , a vintage-inspired helmet brand, and Rareform , known for their upcycled handbags, brings a fresh addition to the cycling community: a limited-edition Crossbody Handlebar Bag . This eco-friendly, multi-functional accessory is made from recycled billboards, offering cyclists a durable, weather-resistant storage option while on the move.\nThe bag, constructed entirely from upcycled billboards sourced across the U.S., is a unique fusion of form and function. Rareform, which diverts over 11,000 billboards from landfills each month, has long been a leader in repurposing materials that would otherwise go to waste. The result? No two bags are alike. Each one offers its own distinct pattern, making it a true one-of-a-kind accessory for any cyclist.\nA Bag that Adapts to Your Ride\nMore than just a pretty face, this bag is designed for versatility. Whether you’re on your daily commute or heading out for a weekend ride, the Crossbody Handlebar Bag easily transitions from bike to body. The clever design allows you to quickly disengage the handlebar hardware and convert it into a crossbody bag. The ergonomically angled strap tucks neatly into an interior pocket while you’re riding, keeping things sleek and hassle-free.\nThis thoughtful blend of practicality and design makes it an ideal companion for urban cyclists, bike commuters, or anyone who values functional, sustainable gear.\nFor more great gear check out this article .\nBuilt for the Elements\nThe recycled billboard material isn’t just environmentally friendly—it’s also waterproof. With a water-repellent outer shell, cyclists can rely on this bag to protect their gear from the elements, whether caught in an unexpected downpour or riding through the morning mist. The bag’s two-liter storage capacity is perfect for carrying essentials like your phone, wallet, keys, and small snacks.\nSafety, as always, is paramount for Thousand, and this bag reflects that with a reflective front logo, enhancing visibility during low-light rides. It’s a small but important detail that urban cyclists will appreciate.\nFor more information on the new Crossbody Handlebar Bag, go here .",
