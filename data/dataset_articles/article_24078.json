  "text": "The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has begun repairing streetlights alongside road construction. The initiative will be gradually implemented across all seven districts of Karachi. The KMC will also convert the street lights on solar energy. Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab said the KMC's engineering department had been instructed to ensure that the streetlights on 106 roads under the KMC jurisdiction were kept in a proper condition and monitored regularly. He said that like the lights in the KMC’s head office, the streetlights on major roads would also be converted to a solar panel system to ensure that they remain lit during power outages from the K-Electric. In a statement on Thursday, Wahab emphasised a zero-tolerance policy regarding Karachi's infrastructure, roads and streetlights, asserting that the quality of work would not be compromised. He instructed the director general of the engineering department to form teams to conduct daily road inspections and maintain streetlights. He mentioned that streetlights on major roads in District South such as Shahrah-e-Ghalib, Marine Drive, Clifton Bridge, Mai Kolachi Road, MT Khan Road, MA Jinnah Road, Nishtar Road, Steel Bridge and Jinnah Bridge near the Regent Plaza had been fully restored. He added that the Pakistan Peoples Party was restoring the lights of Karachi, which were an essential part of the city's identity, and assured that they would never be dimmed.
