  "text": "OLD TOWN, Maine — The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has approved the expansion of Maine’s largest landfill. The state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town and Alton can now move forward with plans to add 11.9 million cubic yards to its facility. The Maine DEP determined that the Juniper Ridge Landfill expansion would provide a substantial public benefit. The department said in its ruling that the expansion does meet the goals of the state and region and promotes environmental justice. \"We're happy to work with the state to make sure that facility is something that serves the needs of Maine now and in the future,\" Jeff Weld, vice president of communications of Casella , said. After hearing public opinion, the DEP said to mitigate environmental concerns, Casella, the company that operates the facility, must inform the public about significant landfill events, complete an odor analysis, and install a system to treat PFAS that comes from the landfill. \"We feel like that's the next step in landfill technology, and to be able to do that for the state of Maine through this expansion is something that we feel like we can accomplish,\" Weld said. Many people who live near the landfill are still concerned about the environmental impact the expansion might have. \"I think it's a very sad day for the people of Old Town,\" Old Town resident Ed Spencer said. Spencer lives two miles from the landfill and said he often can smell the odors coming from it. \"When it's strong, it makes you almost panic, because you know you shouldn't be breathing that stuff,\" Spencer said. These environmental impacts are especially concerning to nearby Penobscot Nation, particularly the PFAS that comes from the landfill going into the Penobscot River. \"There's concerns about their drinking water, concerns about you know, fish,\" Dan Kusnierz, water resources program manager of Penobscot Nation, said. Kusnierz said Penobscot people rely on the river, and it's sacred to the tribe. \"So, it's really important that that water be clean,\" Kusnierz said. People continue to push for more to be done to protect the environment and the people who live near Juniper Ridge. \"I'll continue to fight against this, leading up to expansion,\" Spencer said. According to Casella, it’s in the early stages of the permitting process, which must be done and approved before construction begins.
