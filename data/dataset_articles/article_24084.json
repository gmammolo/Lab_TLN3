  "text": "Gov. Maura Healey issued a permit to the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue for Nibi, a 2-year-old beaver, allowing her to stay at the wildlife rehabilitation center and serve as an educational animal.\n“Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement. “We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species. I’m grateful to our state’s dedicated wildlife biologists who work every day to care for Massachusetts wildlife, and I hope Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.”\nNibi has been cared for by the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue in Chelmsford for the past two years. The wildlife rehabilitator took Nibi in after Jane Newhouse found the animal on the side of the road in Sturbridge in 2022, NBC Boston reported .\nMore News Mass.
