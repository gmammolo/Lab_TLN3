  "text": "The Ottawa County farm teaches people about the importance of preserving nature. OAK HARBOR, Ohio (WTVG) - A special program at Earth Heart Farms in Ottawa County is designed to teach people about the importance of preserving nature. It also helps educate and cultivate future conservationists. The land where Earth Heart Farms sits was originally a family farm. But, it was taken out of production more than 30 years ago. The hope is that by sharing the story with younger generations, they will come away with a new appreciation for nature and be encouraged to help preserve our corner of the planet. Earth Heart Farms is an 80-acre property in Oak Harbor. “People come out here and go, ‘Ahhh. It’s so quiet, so peaceful. It’s instant calm,’” Vicki Rae Harder-Thorne, an owner of the property said. Harder-Thorne said her family farmed the land for more than a century. After a number of family discussions dating back to her grandfather, her mother started the process of taking the land out of production in 1992. “About a decade ago, I joined her in the fall to collect seeds. I got it. I understood her deep love of this place and the connection to her ancestors and those who lived here before them. I understood just how much you nurture yourself as you nurture the land,” Harder-Thorne said. The land is once again home to wetlands and prairies that attract and help sustain all kinds of animals. It is also a prime space for pollinators. Harder-Thorne and her family have been sharing their creation with local school children for the last few years. “We have area schools come out in the fall to do field days and learn things like how to do data collections, check on resource quality and the bio-diversity out here,” Harder-Thorne said. The farm’s work is aimed at planting seeds. “That is all it takes. One child whose life is changed, one child who now understands they are part of nature, not outside it, one child who now understands that everything you do matters,” Harder-Thorne said. What is happening at Earth Heart Farms is a small part of the big picture when it comes to protecting the planet, and it benefits all of us. “We’ve realized that wetlands help naturally filter water and clean it out which helps prevent harmful algal blooms. By bringing back wetlands like the ones here, we are helping filter the water before it goes into Lake Erie,” Basia Gawin, a park ranger at Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge said. Taking care of the land is a year-round job and a community effort. Harder-Thorne said all the work pays immediate dividends. And she is reminded of that through the fall field trips. “Some of the students had never been off of concrete and so they lay in the sun in the grass, just enjoying that feeling of the earth underneath them. They can’t get over that there are grasses that are taller than they are, that there are butterflies just flying around here,” Harder-Thorne said. The goal is to ensure that what is happening now continues for generations. “I am hoping this stays this way forever. I have taken steps with my family to help make that happen and it feels really good,” Harder-Thorne said. There will be more student field trips at Earth Heart Farms this week and next. The goal is to continue growing the reach of the farm. Latest Local News | First Alert Weather | Crime | National | 13abc Originals Copyright 2024 WTVG. All rights reserved.",
