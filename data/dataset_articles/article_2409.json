  "text": "Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill was involved in a disturbing domestic dispute with his wife, daughter and mother-in-law at their Sunny Isles Beach condo on Wednesday afternoon. According to Local 10 News, police responded to a 911 call just before 2:00 p.m. EST after being told of an “assault in progress”. Officers spoke with Tyreek, his wife, Keeta Hill, and her mother, Alesia Vaccaro. Alesia told officers that Tyreek Hill was “very aggressive and impulsive”, and expressed concern over Keeta’s safety. According to the police report, officers were called after Hill threw a laptop to the ground and perilously took his young daughter toward the balcony of the high-rise building: “Authorities said Vacarro called police after claiming that she witnessed Tyreek Hill throw a laptop on the floor, then grab his daughter and begin walking toward the balcony of their residence, following an argument with his wife. Keeta Hill told police that she and Tyreek Hill had been arguing more frequently and stated that whenever she gives her opinion on anything they discuss, “he becomes angry and throws objects around,” the report stated.” Thankfully, the baby was not harmed and is in “good health,” the police report stated. You can hear parts of the 911 call below, but a warning that it may be disturbing for some viewers: According to Local 10 News, there are no pending charges. Even though both sides maintained that it didn’t turn violent, the police report says they noticed “a light redness mark (bruise) on” Alesia’s upper left chest. When officers questioned her about it, Alesia claimed, “it probably had happened without malice when he grabbed the baby from her.” Keela also told officers that she’s filing a divorce from Tyreek Hill. The 31-year-old wide receiver left the condo with police but was not arrested, Local 10 News added. There has been no public comment from Hill or the Dolphins. In December 2014, Hill was arrested after assaulting his pregnant girlfriend, Crystal Espinal. Though he avoided prison time, Hill was given three years probation and kicked off the Oklahoma State football team, prompting him to join the West Alabama program. During the 2019 offseason, a leaked recording emerged of Hill telling his fiancée, “You should be afraid of me too, b**ch,” when she told Hill that their young son (who had suffered a broken arm) was scared of him. Last September, Miami police detained Hill while en route to the team’s season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Hill was taken out of the car and handcuffed despite showing no aggression toward the officers. Two traffic citations were later dismissed, and one of the officers involved was placed on administrative leave. The post originally published on .",
