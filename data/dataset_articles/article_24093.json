  "text": "Eastern Iowa family to provide hot meals to Hurricane Helene victims URBANA, Iowa (KCRG) - The Getty family operates the Country Cooking Concessions food truck. For the next few days they will bring hot meals to the community in Asheville, North Carolina. Asheville is one of the cities that has taken the brunt of destruction from Hurricane Helene. “We know the destruction and damage that a flood can do. So, we’re hoping to show North Carolina some Iowa love,” Jim Getty said. This isn’t Getty’s first time helping hurricane victims. His family fed Hurricane Ian victims in Florida in 2022. “Sometimes you were laughing with the people and they were in great spirits. Other times you cried with them because they lost everything they owned,” Getty said. Getty lost 250 acres of crops this past storm season, but it hasn’t stopped him from helping those less fortunate. “It doesn’t matter where we’re standing, if we have the ability to do it, that’s what we’re going to do. And luckily two years ago we could do it and we’re going to do it again this time too,” Getty said. In fact, the Getty family wants to be able to eventually help when every devastating event strikes. “The more people, the more donations, the more support, that’ll definitely gives us an advantage to do more of these disasters. That is definitely our goal,” Getty said. You can find information on how to contact the Getty family to support and donate to the cause on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Countrycookingconcessionsbc). Copyright 2024 KCRG.
