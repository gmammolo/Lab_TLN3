  "text": "Days of near-endless rain stemming from Hurricane Helene have effectively ended the drought in Central Virginia. The outer bands and remnants of the storm that devastated corners of the Southeast — killing roughly 215 people, washing away entire towns in the Appalachian Mountains and stranding thousands without access to the internet or cellphone service — dropped several inches of rain on Charlottesville and its surrounding counties. In total, 9 inches of rain fell on the area in the month of September alone — most of that from the recent storms. In June, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality issued drought advisories for all 95 cities and counties in the commonwealth. By August, almost all of Central Virginia and the neighboring Shenandoah Valley were in a drought, varying from moderate conditions in the east closer to Richmond to extreme conditions in the mountains in the northern triangle tip of the state. People are also reading… But rain throughout September, particularly later in the month as Helene made landfall in Florida last Friday, not only pulled the area out of a drought but out of any drought advisory. In Charlottesville, the Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority officially lifted a drought watch for Albemarle County and Charlottesville this week. “The Rivanna Regional Drought Response Committee recommended lifting the drought watch after local reservoirs and streams returned to normal levels,” the authority said in a statement issued Wednesday. “As of October 2, 2024, our reservoirs are at 100% of usable capacity due to the significant amount of precipitation that the area has received over the past several days.” Conditions have also stabilized in surrounding Buckingham, Greene, Louisa, Madison, Nelson and Orange counties. Abnormally dry conditions persist on the northwest edge of the state and the Eastern Shore, but those regions are also no longer in a drought. The change is good news for Central Virginia ranchers, who spent the summer watching their pastures dry up and their livestock losing weight. Many dipped into winter reserves in order to feed their animals. Breeding was also made more challenging in the hot and dry conditions, and many resorted to selling off livestock to stay solvent. While the storms have brought much-needed rain to the area, they also lifted local rivers and creeks out of their banks, flooding low-lying areas and washing away some roads entirely. As the week progressed, roads have slowly started to reopen. Roadways in Louisa, Nelson and Orange counties closed due to flooding have all reopened, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation as of Thursday. Roads that remain closed in Central Virginia as of Thursday include: Albemarle County - Burchs Creek Road from Miller School Road to Dick Woods Road. - Gillums Ridge Road to Dick Woods Road. - Craigs Store Road from White Mountain Road to Castle Rock Road. - Goodloe Lane from Critzers Shop Road to Old Turnpike Road. - Whippoorwill Road from Cardinal Ridge Road to Garth Road. Buckingham County - Crumptown Road. Greene County - Mutton Hollow Road from Matties Run Road to Spotswood Trail. - South River Road. - Octonia Road. Madison County - Lindsay Lane from Old Blue Ridge Turnpike to the dead end. - Hughes River Road from FT Valley Road to Nethers Road. For real-time updates on road closures across the commonwealth dial 511 from any phone in Virginia or visit the VDOT 511 website at [511virginia.org](http://511virginia.org).",
