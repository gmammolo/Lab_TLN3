  "text": "To celebrate Electric Vehicle Week, the City of South Fulton has introduced a fleet of new electric vehicles, from Mustangs to F-150s. This year, the city has introduced 11 vehicles and 12 charging stations, with plans to add 17 more vehicles and up to 60 additional charging stations by 2025, promoting eco-friendly options for the future. “We are very committed to sustainable energy and we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint here in the city,” City of South Fulton City Manager Sharon Subadan said. “We are a growing region, so we have lots of opportunities to serve in the community using our vehicles. Some of these vehicles will be used for building expectations and some will be used for our general services that take care of all of our facilities.” The new fleet, introduced during a press conference on Oct. 3, features seven Ford Mustang Mach-E models, three Ford F-150 Lightning trucks, and one Ford E-Transit Cargo Van. According to city officials, these vehicles offer cost-effective and environmentally friendly benefits, including zero emissions, batteries with lifespans of 3 to 5 years, and construction from sustainable materials. Another advantage of the new fleet is the expansion of community charging stations. Currently, there are two charging stations at the Southwest Arts Center and the Fredrick Administration Building. City officials announced that of the 60 new charging stations arriving next year, many will be placed throughout the city for public access. “I am excited because this has been a long time in the making and I have been pushing this initiative since I was a councilman,” City of South Fulton Mayor Kobi, who recently changed his name from khalid kamau, said. “We’re building a whole new city and nearly everything we’ve inherited from the county was either at or past its obsolescence. We wanted to provide so much more to our residents. We have so many vehicles that we are buying all the time, so I thought it was important that we got vehicles that were green not only for the environmental impact but also for the economic impact.”",
