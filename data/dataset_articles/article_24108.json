  "text": "Unceded Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh territories (Vancouver, B.C.) — Stand.earth climate experts and advocates are responding to the B.C. NDP’s platform released today, with a particular focus on oil and gas, old growth forests protections, and building electrification. With some positive re-commitments to essential measures, the B.C. NDP has acknowledged the overwhelming majority of voters who care deeply about taking real steps to protect nature and reduce pollution – and must now convince voters that it can implement its commitments with the urgency required.\nLiz McDowell, Senior Campaigns Director at Stand.earth , said:\n“Alongside urgent issues like the cost of living, B.C. residents continue to care deeply about environmental protection. Luckily, making life more affordable for everyday people can go hand-in-hand with tackling the climate crisis if we tax big polluters and use the profits to scale up clean, affordable renewable energy. This platform, while markedly less ambitious than the Green platform released earlier this week, recommits to some essential measures – like reining in pollution throug h stronger regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas, a nd protecting critical forests through the Old Growth Strategic Review – that could go a long way, if implemented with the urgency and scale required.”\nSven Biggs, Canadian Oil and Gas Program Director at Stand.earth, said:\n“We are encouraged to see that the B.C. NDP is committing in their platform to make B.C. a “clean energy superpower” by expanding the amount of renewable energy generated in the province and investing in the electrification of our economy. However the omission of a plan to put hard limits on the growth of the number of fracking wells and LNG terminals in the province undercuts this otherwise positive step forward.”\nSunil Singal, Climate Campaigner for SAFE Cities Canada at Stand.earth, said:\n“We need to tackle the affordability crisis by accelerating the transition to more affordable ways of heating our homes. It is good to see the B.C. NDP are committed to reducing the cost of heat pumps for residents, however we need to also end the expansion of inefficient gas systems in new buildings. We shouldn’t be heating and cooling our homes with old technology to the detriment of people’s health and cost of living.”\nTegan Hansen, Senior Forest Campaigner at Stand.earth, said:\n“B.C. parties have presented voters with vastly different visions for the future of forests. It’s hopeful to see both the NDP and the Greens make strong commitments to work in partnership with First Nations on land and water protection, which must be a priority for the next government. While all parties have some hopeful promises, the NDP to an extent and the Conservatives in particular need to step up with solid implementation plans to keep remaining old growth standing and support communities facing the devastating impacts of decades of mismanagement. With many forests teetering on the brink, voters in this election have an opportunity to give a powerful push in either direction.”\nWith just over two weeks to go before voters head to the polls, candidate debates – and the televised leaders’ debate on October 8 in particular – must include questions that press each party on their plans to implement measures that tackle climate change and affordability, as B.C. communities face the devastating impacts of the climate crisis.\nStand.earth’s climate experts and advocates are available for comment on B.C. environmental policy issues during the election campaign, and on the climate priorities the new legislative assembly must put at the top of their agenda.\n###\nMedia contacts:\nFor comment on oil, LNG, electrification and renewable energy –\nSven Biggs, 778-882-8354, sven@stand.earth and Kiki Wood, kiki@stand.earth , 604-757-7030\nFor comment on old growth forests , industrial logging, and forest biomass –\nTegan Hansen, tegan@stand.earth\nFor comment on building electrification and progressive building policies – Sunil Singal, 604-368-3536, sunil.singal@stand.earth\nFor assistance with arranging interviews, please contact Stand.earth’s Canada Communications Specialists –\nKathryn Semogas, 778-653-2303, kathryn.semogas@stand.earth (Pacific Time)\nArin de Hoog, 613-978-7329, arin.dehoog@stand.earth (Eastern Time)",
