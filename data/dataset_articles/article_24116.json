  "text": "The Rural Fire Service is urging residents in bushfire prone parts of Sutherland Shire to prepare for an emergency. The official Bushfire Danger Period in the shire and Illawarra began on October 1. RFS Inspector David Bartlett said the declaration meant affected residents should make and discuss their bush fire survival plan. \"Having a bush fire survival plan will ensure all members of the household know what to do on days of increased fire danger and what to do if their home is threatened by fire,\" he said. \"Residents should prepare their property by removing flammable materials from their yards, clearing leaves from gutters, checking hoses can reach all around the house and where appropriate, conducting hazard reduction activities. \"Never leave a fire unattended and if a fire does escape, it is essential to call Triple Zero (000) immediately so that emergency services can respond accordingly and minimise the damage.\" During the Bush Fire Danger period, landowners and managers are required to obtain a Fire Permit from their local Fire Control Centre before lighting any fires, including hazard reduction burns. Fire permit applications can be completed online by visiting the NSW Rural Fire Service website. On days of Total Fire Ban all Bush Fire Hazard Reduction Certificates are automatically revoked. Information about hazard reduction burning and required notifications is available on the RFS website at: rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/BFDP",
