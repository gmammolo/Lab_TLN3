  "text": "Over 50 federal and provincial planning officials have been trained in integrating carbon markets into government project approvals in an effort to support Pakistan to combat climate change and meet its international obligations. Supporting Preparedness for Article 6 Cooperation (SPAR6C), in collaboration with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, organised a two-day carbon market training workshop for federal and provincial planning and development officials, a press release said. The workshop brought together officials responsible for appraising public investment projects. The event was aimed at enhancing their understanding of carbon credits and how these could be leveraged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, align with global climate goals and secure vital international financing. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, the SPAR6C programme supports developing countries, including Pakistan, in navigating carbon markets. This initiative is part of the SPAR6C programme, aimed at boosting Pakistan's participation in international carbon markets, which could generate between $2 billion and $5 billion by 2030. Pakistan has set a bold target of cutting projected emissions by 50% by 2030, with 35% of this reduction conditional on international financial support. The Paris Agreement's Article 6 provides new avenues for the country to access carbon markets and secure funding for sustainable projects. Speaking on the occasion, Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Aisha Humera, emphasised the importance of this opportunity: \"This is a golden chance to learn how to claim carbon credits. Few in Pakistan have this skill, and it can position you as a leader in your field.\" German embassy representative Janine Rohwer highlighted the importance of carbon markets for both Pakistan and Germany in meeting climate targets, adding that \"aligning with international standards will make private investment more attractive for Pakistan.\" COMMENTS Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.
