  "text": "GEN-I Group put into operation a 11.8 MW solar power plant in the municipality of Kavadarci in North Macedonia. It estimated the facility’s maximum annual output at 15.5 GWh. Slovenian energy trader and supplier GEN-I Group commissioned its second photovoltaic plant in North Macedonia. The system was connected to the grid on August 8, the company said.\nThe photovoltaic facility spans six hectares on a seven-hectare lot of very degraded land. The Ljubas site is on hilly terrain in the municipality of Kavadarci.\nThe new solar power plant consists of 17,612 modules of 11.8 MW in total. GEN-I estimated its maximum production at 15.5 GWh per year. It is equivalent to the electricity needs of 3,400 domestic households, according to the announcement.\nBoth GEN-I’s PV plants abroad are in North Macedonia\nThe company also develops solar power projects in its home market and provides green energy services including the installation of photovoltaics. Earlier this year, GEN-I built the first community solar power plant in Slovenia. It said it installed more than 10,000 small PV systems in the country and two larger ones in North Macedonia.\nTwo years ago, GEN-I put into operation a 17 MW solar power plant in North Macedonia. The facility is the vicinity of the village of Amzabegovo in the municipality of Sveti Nikole. It was the biggest in the country at the time.\n“With projects like the one in Kavadarci, we are increasing our investments in renewable sources. Investments such as these are becoming more and more common in North Macedonia, as they enable brownfield sites to be used for sustainable purposes, such as the production of solar power. At the GEN-I Group, we are intensively developing projects, through the construction of large solar power plants in Slovenia as well, that give new value to degraded land through the sustainable production of carbon-free energy, even in the face of complex spatial and regulatory expectations,” Management Board President Maks Helbl stated.\nHe recalled that GEN-I was the first in Slovenia to supply only carbon-free electricity. The company trades in 24 wholesale markets.",
