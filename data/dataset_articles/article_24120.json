It includes up to $5.7 billion for climate-smart practices funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and $2 billion in Farm Bill funding. Through changing temperatures, precipitation patterns, drought, flooding, and increasingly more severe extreme events, such as hurricanes and wildfires, climate change is affecting the livelihood of USDA’s stakeholders. Innovations in adapting to such changes will be central to the future success of working lands. This historic level of federal funding includes more than $16 million available to Ocean State producers through the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in Rhode Island (NRCS-RI). \"We are excited to support Rhode Island’s farmers & forest managers with an historic investment in conservation this Fiscal Year,\" said NRCS Rhode Island State Conservationist, R. Phou Vongkhamdy. \"With the addition of Inflation Reduction Act funds, we have more than doubled our federal funding allocation to help farmers address their natural resource concerns and achieve their stewardship goals.\" Available conservation practices and initiatives include, but are not limited to, [Combustion system improvement and energy initiative](/conservation-basics/conservation-by-state/rhode-island/act-now-rhode-island)practices to help farmers and forest managers to replace outdated engines, lighting and other equipment with new, cleaner-burning technology.[Comprehensive nutrient management](/conservation-basics/conservation-by-state/rhode-island/act-now-rhode-island)plan implementation practices to minimize or eliminate surface water or groundwater pollution or to minimize emissions (like greenhouse gases) to improve air quality.[Climate-smart ag and forestry](/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/climate/climate-smart-mitigation-activities)activities that create or enhance pollinator or wildlife habitat on farms, forest lands, ranches, and urban areas.[Oyster reef restoration initiative](/conservation-basics/conservation-by-state/rhode-island/rhode-island-oyster-restoration-initiative)practices to improve water quality and encourage the development of wildlife habitat by implementing conservation practices that create oyster reefs.- Targeted conservation actions through the [National Water Quality Initiative](/programs-initiatives/national-water-quality-initiative/rhode-island/national-water-quality)to improve water quality in the Sakonnet River and Tomaquag Brook-Pawcatuck River watersheds.

Funding is provided through a competitive process. NRCS accepts applications for conservation programs year-round but sets state-specific ranking dates to evaluate applications for funding. Application cutoff periods allow NRCS to screen and rank applications for those with the highest conservation benefits across Rhode Island’s landscapes, including cropland, pastureland, and private non-industrial forestlands. The first application cutoff date is Friday, October 4th. But don't worry, if you miss our first cutoff you can apply for our second round of funding before January 10, 2025. Applications received after these ranking dates will be automatically deferred to the next funding period. NRCS is a federal agency that works hand-in-hand with conservation districts and the people of Rhode Island to improve and protect soil, water, air, plants, animals, energy, habitats and other natural resources.
