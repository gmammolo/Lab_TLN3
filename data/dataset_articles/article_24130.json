The integration of the community to the ZASCA Center, as well as the strengthening of the productive chain, can contribute to a paradigm shift in the relationship between people and their ecosystems, promoting a more harmonious and sustainable development.”\nYou may be interested in: Superfinanciera ordered Ferney Alarcón not to continue collecting money",
