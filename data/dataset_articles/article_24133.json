The project is intended to tie into existing flood protection systems and is being designed so it does not adversely impact nearby areas. “I would also like to say that it's great to see local government collaborating with industry on a project that has clear benefits to the region.” Regional Councillor Neil Kirton said: “This agreement represents a vital step forward in ensuring that the Awatoto industrial area is better prepared for future extreme weather events. By collaborating with our local partners, we are committed to building a more resilient community and safeguarding critical infrastructure.\" Napier Mayor Kirsten Wise said: “The impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle highlighted the need for stronger flood mitigation in Awatoto. By coming together to address these challenges, we are ensuring the long-term safety of all those who live and work in that area and the viability of this important industrial zone for Napier’s economy.”",
