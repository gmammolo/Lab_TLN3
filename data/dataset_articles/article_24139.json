  "text": "[Global News Select](/news/dow-jones) Energy Up as Oil Futures Surge — Energy Roundup Shares of energy companies rose alongside oil futures after President Biden acknowledged discussions about a potential Israeli retaliatory strike on Iranian oil facilities. U.S. oil futures settled up 5.2% to $73.71 a barrel, the largest percentage gain in roughly a year. The Israeli military urged civilians in more than 20 towns and villages across southern Lebanon to leave their homes, expanding its evacuation warnings in the country as it intensifies its campaign to push militant group Hezbollah back from its border. Natural gas futures rose 2.9% to $2.97 per million British thermal units, snapping a two-session losing streak, with weather forecasts seen as gradually growing colder on the East Coast.
