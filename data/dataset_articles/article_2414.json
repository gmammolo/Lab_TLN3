  "text": "Man killed in El Paso is SWLA native, family says\nEL PASO, Texas (KPLC) - El Paso police are investigating a homicide near Fort Bliss, a Texas military base, and a Southwest Louisiana family identified the victim as a Sulphur native.\nKameryn LeBert, of Sulphur, said the victim is her brother, Larry Donnell Lacey III, 23. He lived in El Paso at the time of his death.\nThe El Paso Police Department announced in a news release that officers discovered a dead man in a home on the 4000 block of Fillmore Avenue after responding to a welfare check on Wednesday, April 2. Police described the death as “suspicious” but did not give more details.\n7News contacted an El Paso Police Department spokesman, who said he could not provide more information or confirm if Lacey was the victim.\nLacey was raised in Sulphur until he was 17, when he was placed in foster care, LeBert said. He graduated from high school in Baton Rouge and entered the military upon graduation.\n“He was a very special person,” LeBert said. “I know a lot of people probably say that about their loved ones, but he definitely was. He could make anyone smile or laugh. He was very determined in everything he did, and he had big dreams and big plans for his future, and I know he was very excited to become a dad.”\nLeBert said Lacey’s son is to be born within the next month.\nShe believes Lacey had a kind heart, and it may have led to his death.\nShe said the family has suspicions about what happened as Lacey was expecting a visit from a friend on Sunday, March 30. That’s the last day LeBert says family spoke with Lacey.\nThe victim’s family is now desperately searching for answers.\n“We are hoping for justice and seeking justice,” LeBert said. “If anything, we want to get his face out there and his actual story. I feel like right now he’s just being labeled as the seventh murder of 2025.”\nA\nGoFundMe has been created to help with funeral expenses.\nCopyright 2025 KPLC. All rights reserved.",
