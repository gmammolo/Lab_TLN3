  "text": "COLUMBIA — University of Missouri researchers have developed a liquid-based solution that eliminates more than 98% of microscopic plastic particles in water.\nMicroplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 5 millimeters, which is about the size of a pencil eraser, to 1 nanometer, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency . For context, a strand of human hair is about 80,000 nanometers wide — that means a strand of hair is 80,000 times wider than the smallest sized microplastic.\nWater-repellent solvent separates from water, trapping microplastics in its molecular structure\nSiobhan Harms, KOMU 8 Reporter “Our technology is basically a liquid film, so it absorbs the microplastics in its own liquid environment, and then phase separates that from the water,\" said Gary Baker, an associate professor of chemistry at MU.\nThe liquid-based solution is a solvent made from natural ingredients. When mixed with water, the solvent acts similar to oil by floating back up to the surface. But, on its way up, the solvent carries the microplastics within its molecular structure.\n“You can, in principle, reuse that, extract the microplastics from it and recycle it to use it again,” Baker said.\nBaker said researchers across the country have been exploring different ways to address the issues that arise from microplastics.\nSuccess!
