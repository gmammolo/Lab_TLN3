  "text": "[Second Annual Ocean Awareness Day in Honor of Walter Munk Coming to La Jolla](https://lajolla.com/news/second-annual-walter-munk-day-coming-to-la-jolla-oct-14/) Celebrate the Oceans at Walter Munk Day in La Jolla The third annual Walter Munk Day, which celebrates our oceans and local indigenous culture, is returning to La Jolla this Saturday. If you’re unfamiliar with Walter Munk, he was a legendary La Jolla scientist and oceanographer who spent the bulk of his career at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. His work directly furthered science’s understanding of ocean conditions, swells, waves, tides, and currents. From 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Walter Munk Foundation will be celebrating the 80-year legacy of the legendary La Jolla scientist with the third annual Walter Munk Day. Previously known as Ocean Awareness Day, the event will “raise awareness of the fragility of our oceans and showcase Kumeyaay heritage and culture.” The event will take place at Kellogg Park at [La Jolla Shores](https://lajolla.com/profiles/la-jolla-shores/). It will feature an opening Kumeyaay prayer, scavenger hunts, food trucks, face painters, art, music, and more. You can expect to learn a lot about Munk’s legacy and the ocean in general. There will be a keynote discussion from Dr. Dimitri Deheyn of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and various talks about everything from SeaWorld’s story about an orphaned gray whale and how Munk affected the very first Navy SEAL Underwater Demolition Team mission. For more information or to volunteer for the day, please visit the Walter Munk Foundation [website](https://www.waltermunkfoundation.org/walter-munk-day). Media credibe: Adobe Stock",
