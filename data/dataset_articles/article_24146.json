  "text": "Kolkata: Smart ReBins or sensor-fitted waste bins were introduced at a private hospital this week to prevent plastic litter and make the premises plastic-free. Apart from turning hospitals into no-plastic zones, the smart bins will ensure timely collection and segregation of clinical waste, which is potentially dangerous for health. The initiative is a collaborative effort, led by CII West Bengal Healthcare Taskforce in partnership with Magpet Polymers Pvt Ltd, a PET circular enterprise. The bins were set up at Charnock Hospital on Tuesday and a few more hospitals in the city plan to instal them, too.Fitted with sensors that track fill levels and alert the central system about the time to empty, the bins help prevent overflow or littering. Each bin is around six-ft tall and can store a considerable amount of wastes. Hospitals, in turn, get plastic credits as recognition for recycling.Shaped like bottles, the bins are geo-tagged and geo-fenced, preventing them from being moved or stolen. “These innovative recycling bins will be installed all over our hospital. The goal is to eliminate plastic bottle litter and ensure plastic waste is responsibly collected & processed, contributing to a circular economy. It places hospitals, like Charnock, at the forefront of sustainability in the healthcare sector,” said Charnock MD Prashant Sharma.Another private hospital is also considering ReBins. “Littering can be greatly curbed with sensor-fitted bins. We are ready to switch to ReBins,” said the hospital CEO.ReBins also promoted social inclusion by providing income opportunities to waste-pickers. “PET bottles collected through Smart ReBins will be recycled into high-quality materials, reinforcing the circular economy model,” added Sharma.

Only 31.2% of the 46,492 bins given out between 2016-21 are in use. The initiative aims to promote proper waste segregation and treatment, addressing recent audit criticisms.113827281Gadkari pushes for use of plastic waste in highway constructionUnion Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari announced a mandate to use plastic waste in highway construction, recycling 80 lakh tonnes for stretches between New Delhi and Mumbai.
