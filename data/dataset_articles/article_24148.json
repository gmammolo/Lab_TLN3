  "text": "Kolkata: As urban sprawl challenges law enforcement agencies in navigating congested lanes, Bengal has come up with a solution—e-bicycles, which will curb pollution as well as allow cops to access narrow stretches without hindrance. The West Bengal pollution control board has partnered with Bengal Police for the green initiative, under which PCB will provide 1,450 e-bicycles to police across the state. WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra recently presented 25 e-bicycles to DGP Rajeev Kumar in the presence of Rajesh Kumar, principal secretary of the environment department and member secretary of WBPCB. Rajesh Kumar said, “Cycles provide a sustainable and efficient solution for law enforcement. They produce zero emission, cutting down on air as well as noise pollution. Their lower maintenance costs and reduced fuel consumption bring significant savings, while the speed on e-cycles allows for faster response times, especially in crowded or narrow space.”Echoing him, Rudra said, “E-bicycles will help cops patrol vast areas efficiently without physical strain. At the same time, with e-cycles, they will cut down on particulate pollution and carbon emissions.” This initiative is part of National Clean Air Programme. While this was a promising start, Rajesh Kumar said large-scale use would be key to maximizing its advantage.We also published the following articles recentlyMeghalaya, Bihar beat Delhi in air pollutionByrnihat, a small town on the Meghalaya-Assam border, faces severe air pollution due to its clustered industries, heavy interstate truck movement, and construction activities.
