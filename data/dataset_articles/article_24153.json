  "text": "New family of lemurs joins Palm Beach Zoo\nThe Palm Beach Zoo has brand-new residents who moved here all the way from Madagascar.\nA family of six black-and-white ruffed lemurs joined Palm Beach Zoo’s Lemur Island. These are the first black-and-white lemurs to join Palm Beach Zoo's family.\nThe mom and dad, Zara and Louie, and their 5-month-old babies Pierre, Marcell, Remy and Juliette are the newest neighbors to five red ruffed lemurs and three ring-tailed lemurs as of just a few weeks ago.\nThe latest: Entertainment coverage from WPBF 25 News\nVisitors will notice that the different types of lemurs live in their own habitats, separated by water. Lemurs can't swim!\nThe golden-eyed and bushy-tailed curious primates are fitting in just right.\nMike Terrell with Palm Beach Zoo said, \"The climate in Madagascar and the climate in South Florida is very similar. It's hot, it's humid, it's very lush, and Madagascar is an island, so these guys are adapting very well to their new island home.\"\nYour neighborhood: Local coverage from WPBF 25 News\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs are a critically-endangered species. Now that they are at the Palm Beach Zoo, visitors will be able to enjoy seeing how playful and adventurous this family is.\nMake sure you check out the Palm Beach Zoo’s 31 days of Fall Fun. You can see animals enjoying pumpkins and bobbing for apples, and these lemurs will get to eat sunflowers!\nA Moment of Joy: News We Love\nFollow us on social: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | TikTok",
