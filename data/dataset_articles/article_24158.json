  "text": "As the chill of October sets in and winter looms, your hydrangeas enter a low-maintenance phase , settling into dormancy during the late autumn and early winter months.\nThat said, your garden&apos;s hydrangeas shouldn&apos;t be completely neglected . A few key tasks now can set them up for stunning spring blooms .\nGarden gurus highlight three critical steps to take before November knocks: clearing debris, pruning last season&apos;s blooms especially on old wood, and mulching. This trifecta is the ticket to a thriving hydrangea come spring.\nThree hydrangea tasks to do before October ends for &apos;beautiful&apos; spring blooms Hydrangeas can grow in a stunning purple hue using a cheap kitchen leftover Martha Stewart, the landmark of domestic know-how, gives her two cents on the topic with an online guide. \"Your hydrangea has most likely gone dormant at this stage of the year and needs little to no attention. Remove and discard any foliage with leaf spots to minimize the chance of reinfection next year,\" she advises.\nHydrangeas will ‘come back even biggger’ after winter if 3 ‘essential’ tasks are done now (Image: Getty) Stewart also suggests, \"Use October to top off your mulch to maintain a 2-to-3-inch layer for added winter protection. You can also prioritize pruning hydrangeas that bloom on old wood this month.\"\nHowever, your work isn&apos;t done yet. There are steps to take in November to safeguard your hydrangeas for the colder winter months.\nYou can protect young hydrangeas from snowfall by placing stakes or burlap wrapping around them.\nIt&apos;s important that the wrapping doesn&apos;t directly touch the plant. The aim is to provide both protection and ventilation.\nGenerally, hydrangeas require minimal watering during their dormant winter months. But don&apos;t hesitate to water them during a dry spell to prevent the soil from drying out.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
