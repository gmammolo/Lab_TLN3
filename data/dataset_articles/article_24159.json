  "text": "1% for the Planet , a globally recognized organization that inspires businesses and individuals to support environmental solutions, today announced a Commitment to Action at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 2024 Annual Meeting . As a member of the CGI community, 1% for the Planet is making a commitment, which will catalyze business and individual giving for the planet and inspire $1 billion in lifetime certified impact by 2028. It took 1% for the Planet 20 years to reach $500 million in certified giving. Now, the organization seeks to double its achievements in a quarter of the time. “We’re committed to reaching $1 billion in environmental giving by 2028 and we welcome businesses, philanthropists and impact investors who can join us in realizing this commitment to transformative philanthropy,” said Kate Williams, CEO of 1% for the Planet. “Only together can we create a global, collective movement delivering effective and impactful action at speed and scale.” Philanthropy at the Forefront In the U.S., only 3% of total philanthropy is directed to environmental causes, according to Giving USA, and globally less than 2% goes to climate mitigation efforts. Increasing environmental giving is vital to enhance public and private efforts to tackle species loss, environmental justice, conservation, and a host of other issues requiring action. 1% for the Planet facilitates sustained commitments to environmental organizations across four impact areas: Rights to Nature, Conservation & Restoration, Resilient Communities, and Just Economies. The organization vets nonprofits in these impact areas and helps its members build philanthropic partnerships with them, resulting in support for environmental sustainability and social equity on a global scale. The organization’s unique approach embraces collective action to drive positive impact and spurs environmental action by encouraging businesses to contribute 1% of their sales to vetted environmental organizations. With over 5,000 member businesses in 60+ countries, they combat greenwashing by certifying contributions made directly by businesses to vetted organizations. In 2022, 1% for the Planet introduced the Planet Impact Fund , which enables individuals, foundations and businesses to confidently do more with their money by supporting an expertly curated portfolio of environmental impact investments and grants \"The Planet Impact Fund represents an exciting opportunity for individuals and businesses alike who are looking for simple, strategic ways to drive smart, dual impact with their dollars,\" said Susan Lane, Director of Philanthropy at 1% for the Planet. \"At a time when the need for investment in solutions is urgent, the Planet Impact Fund represents a powerful impact driver.\" About 1% for the Planet 1% for the Planet is a global organization that exists to ensure our planet and future generations thrive. We inspire businesses and individuals to support environmental partners through membership and everyday actions. We make environmental giving easy and effective through partnership advising, impact storytelling and third-party certification. Started in 2002 by Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia, and Craig Mathews, founder of Blue Ribbon Flies, our members have given hundreds of millions of dollars to our approved environmental partners to date. Today, 1% for the Planet’s global network consists of thousands of businesses, individuals and environmental partners working toward a better future for all.
