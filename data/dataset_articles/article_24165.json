  "text": "A NONPROFIT organization on Thursday called for urgent action to shift from linear, to “circular” economy through community-led action, inclusive partnerships, and innovative solutions to plastic waste and marine litter. Compared to a linear economy, which is essentially an economy in which finite resources are extracted to make products that are used not to their full potential and then thrown away, a “circular economy” is a resource production and consumption model that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. Essentially, it means extending the life cycle of a product—including packaging. The pitch was made by Antoinette Taus, founder and executive director of the group Communities Organized for Resource Allocation (Cora) during a recently concluded international conference dubbed “SEA of Solutions 2024: Delivering actions to end plastic pollution” conference, which was held at the United Nations Conference Center in Bangkok, Thailand, last month. “We must ensure a just transition as we strengthen circular economy solutions to #BeatPlasticPollution. Our oceans, communities, and children depend on it. We have witnessed firsthand the powerful force of local communities in the Philippines, especially women and youth, in driving sustainable solutions. But we need greater collaboration to scale these efforts to tackle the problem at the source,” Taus said in a statement. Taus said a circular economy plays a crucial role in addressing the pressing issue of plastic pollution, particularly in coastal areas. Landfills and marine environments are often the final destination for discarded plastics, posing a grave threat to precious ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. A study by the World Bank revealed that the Philippines discards a staggering 163 million sachets, 48 million plastic bags, and three million diapers daily. The latest findings from the 2023 Rapid Assessment Standing Stock Survey carried out by Cora at the Las Piñas-Parañaque Wetland Park revealed that food wrappers and sachets constitute the predominant type of marine litter, comprising 33 percent of the total waste collected. This alarming statistic is closely followed by plastic bottles, accounting for 15 percent of the accumulated waste. “Plastic pollution threatens ecosystems and both marine and human life. By advancing a circular economy, we minimize waste and pollution by creating closed-loop systems where materials are reused, recycled or regenerated,” Taus added. Jonathan L.
