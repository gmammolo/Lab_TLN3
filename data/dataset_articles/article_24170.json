  "text": "International pop icon and actor Joe Jonas is starting off October by going green with PlanetPlay. As the not-for-profit platform’s latest Star of the Month, the hit singer-songwriter is spearheading the Make Green Tuesday Moves (MGTM) campaign. This mass media initiative will encourage gamers’ virtual passions and take level up against the fight against climate change.\n“Helping our planet is something I really care about,” Jonas says. “And the best part is we can all do that while playing games … PlanetPlay makes sustainability fun and rewarding, so what are you waiting for? Let’s make a difference together.”\nGames, including Boombit’s Hunt Royale and Trailmix’s Love & Pies, will release exclusive characters, skins, badges, puzzles, and more throughout October in partnership with Planet Play’s MGTM program.\nGoogle Play’s dedicated page for the initiative showcases some of the games available through the store. Players who want to engage their #PassiveActivism need only enjoy the gaming experiences, download the green exclusive, and then contribute to sustainability projects curated by Planet Play. Fully certified causes include the Hongera Project, which helps families in Kenya improve their living conditions by manufacturing and distributing clean cookstoves, and the New-Zealand-based WAI Wanaka water conservation project.\nPut your best, low-carbon footprint forward alongside Joe Jonas, PlanetPlay, and tons of games all month long.",
