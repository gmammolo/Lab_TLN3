  "text": "Hide Caption\nWatch: Stunning aurora erupts above observers Beautiful northern lights burst with colors above stargazers in Alaska. So far, 2024 has been an amazing year for astrological phenomena. From the solar eclipse , supermoons , and now a temporary second moon orbiting the Earth, the sky's paintbrush never fails to bring awe to our eyes.\nAnd not to mention the Northern Lights. If you missed the spectacular display in May or the other solar storms over the summer, there might be another chance to witness this magnificent geomagnetic storm tonight into Friday evening.Here's what to know.According to the Space Weather Prediction Center , the northern lights, or aurora borealis, will be visible Thursday night and are expected to peak Friday night. Astrology-loving Ohioans, you might have the chance to get the perfect view of the northern nights.Depending on the conditions, the geomagnetic storm could be visible across Ohio. The highest activity of the northern lights will be tonight between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. and on Friday between sunset and around midnight.\nAurora borealis map tonight Here's a map of the Aurora Borealis forecast created by the Space Weather Prediction Center, showing how far south the aurora might come tonight.\nAccording to the SPWC , part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, minor to strong geomagnetic storms, level G1 out of G3 , are likely tonight and Friday.These storms are caused by coronal mass ejections associated with a recent solar flare from the sun. The storm could cause some power fluctuations, disrupt radio and GPS signals, and push the northern lights to the south.If today's storm hits at G3 strength, it could bring the northern lights back to Ohio.\nIn a story by the Record-Courier , if lower G3 levels in a geomagnetic storm are reached in the late evening or early morning, the aurora may be visible for areas in Ohio down to the Ohio River. If levels stay at G1, the storm might be visible only to those up north into Michigan.\nBy comparison, the May 10 geomagnetic storm that made the aurora visible across Ohio was rated a G5, the most extreme, and brought the northern lights across the U.S.During times of high geomagnetic activity, which pushes the northern lights further south, the aurora will be visible directly overhead in the northern United States, according to the SWPC's viewing tips .For the best viewing, the center recommends that it be very dark. Get away from city lights and avoid trying to see them on the night of a full moon. The best time to view the aurora is within an hour or two of midnight, or 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.Auroras are ribbons of light weaving across Earth's northern or southern polar regions, according to NASA . Magnetic storms that have been triggered by solar activity, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections, cause them. The solar wind carries energetic charged particles from these events away from the sun.\nAccording to Space.com , these energized particles hit the atmosphere at 45 million mph and are redirected to the poles by the earth's magnetic field , creating the light show.\nAccording to NOAA , during major geomagnetic storms, the auroras expand away from the poles and can be seen over some parts of the United States .NASA describes coronal mass ejections as \"huge bubbles of coronal plasma threaded by intense magnetic field lines that are ejected from the sun over the course of several hours.\"The Akron Beacon Journal reports that the space agency says they often look like \"huge, twisted rope\" and can occur with solar flares, or explosions on the sun's surface.\nNOAA offers an aurora dashboard\nIf you're curious about the latest forecast for the aurora, the NOAA has a tool for that. The Aurora Dashboard offers a visual, animated prediction of where the aurora might be seen in the next few minutes as well as the following day.",
