  "text": "Researchers at Trinity College Dublin have discovered a way of converting loose soil and rocks found on the surface of Mars and the moon into construction blocks that could be used to build future settlements.\nScientists who are based at the AMBER Centre in Trinity found that regolith, an assortment of loose surface deposits made of dust and broken rocks, can be converted into strong building materials using small quantities of carbon nanotubes.\nThe research team has demonstrated how the nanotubes can be used as a binder to convert fine sand into solid blocks with a strength approaching that of granite.\nThe discovery paves the way for nanotubes that can be used to fabricate structural materials in extraterrestrial environments, negating the need to transport construction materials and equipment into space.\nThe researchers believe the discovery could also have practical implications for the construction industry on Earth.\nThe findings were published in a scientific journal earlier this year, and Trinity College is highlighting the discovery today to mark the start of 'Space Week Ireland'.\nProject leader, Professor Jonathan Coleman, said that the construction blocks conduct electricity, meaning that they could also be used as internal sensors to monitor the structural health of extraterrestrial buildings.\n\"The composites are also electrically conductive and show a sensitive piezoresistive response - a change in the electrical resistivity of a material when mechanical strain is applied - allowing them to be used to monitor their own structural health,\" Professor Coleman said.\nThe Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research (AMBER) Centre is funded by Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland and is hosted by Trinity College Dublin.\nRunning from the 4-10 of October, Space Week Ireland is an annual celebration of Ireland's involvement in space research and innovation, with events taking place across the country aiming to inspire people of all ages to explore the universe.",
