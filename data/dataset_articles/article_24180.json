  "text": "Gurgaon: Taking suo motu cognizance of a TOI report that dyeing units were operating illegally in the city, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last month directed Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to carry out a survey and take action accordingly. The NGT bench of chairperson Prakash Shrivastava, judicial member Arun Kumar Taygi and expert member Dr A Senthil Vel on Sept 13 noted that the TOI report, titled ‘Dead units on paper, but still dyeing', raised \\\"substantial issues\\\" on compliance with environmental norms.The bench also issued notices to Union environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board, HSPCB and Gurgaon DC to submit their responses at least a week before the next hearing on Oct 16. \\\"The HSPCB is now tasked with surveying and taking action against these illicit units. The aforementioned news item indicates a violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,\\\" it said.TOI reported on Aug 22 that several dyeing units were officially closed, but continued to operate, specifically in Sector 103, Basai and Sector 36. Regulations dictate that only treated industrial waste can be released into the drain. But these units, which appear to be abandoned plots or warehouses, surreptitiously continue dyeing denims and hanging them out to dry.\\\"The article underscores that dyeing units are also categorised as ‘red' industries due to their high pollution levels, and these units are not authorised to operate outside industrial areas. However, they are found in proximity to residential areas, schools, and even the under-construction Sheetla Mata Medical College and Hospital. Residents have long expressed grievances about the malodorous, discoloured water in the drain, which changes hue depending on the dyes used. This pollution has rendered the lives of locals miserable, causing health issues such as asthma and skin rashes,\\\" the order said.The bench went on to cite the article for effects of exposure to heavy metals that are present in denim dyes, and previous orders to four Haryana districts — Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar — for surveying and inspecting dyeing units. Asked about NGT's latest order, HSPCB officials said on Thursday that they are taking action.",
