  "text": "Community volunteers assist in sagebrush planting for National Public Lands Day KEMMERER, Wyo. – The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Kemmerer Field Office hosted a successful community event on National Public Lands Day, Sept. 27, 2024, bringing together volunteers to participate in a sagebrush planting effort at the historic Fossil Well #1 site. This restoration project is a key part of the ongoing reclamation of one of the Kemmerer area’s earliest 20th-century petroleum exploration sites, contributing to the recovery of local ecosystems and wildlife habitats, including sage grouse core habitat. The Fossil Well #1 site, originally known as the Lulu Claim, dates to 1900, when it was founded by members of the Quealy family. After sporadic operations, the well was abandoned prior to 1920. In the fall of 2021, the Kemmerer Field Office, through the BLM’s Orphan Well Program, successfully plugged the Fossil Well #1. Before plugging, both the access road and pad were modified for equipment access, and after the plugging, the site was re-contoured and seeded to aid in the reclamation process. As part of the ongoing reclamation efforts, 200 sagebrush seedlings, grown at the Wyoming Honor Farm, were planted by community members and BLM staff. The idea for this initiative was developed by Ben Molitor, Natural Resources Specialist with BLM, who also coordinated with the Wyoming Honor Farm to make it possible. These seedlings play an important role in habitat restoration, helping to prevent erosion and restore the visual harmony of the landscape. Volunteers used hand tools and UTV water tanks to complete the planting effort. \"The event went off without a hitch,\" said Jerry Frimml, outdoor recreational planner for the Kemmerer Field Office. \"Volunteers enjoyed the experience, and it was great to see everyone pitch in for such an important cause. Restoring public lands like this helps prevent erosion, restore the visual harmony of the landscape, and recreate vital wildlife habitat.\" The two-hour long event saw ten participants, including three community members, six BLM employees, and one Forest Service employee. Volunteers were guided through the planting process, which involved planting the “Big Wyoming” variety of sagebrush seedlings at pre-marked, carefully spaced intervals to ensure their proper growth. The sagebrush planting marks an important step in the final reclamation of the Fossil Well #1 site and highlights the value of public involvement in land restoration. “Reclamation of public lands is important to keep the multi-use available for all users. This type of reclamation helps minimize erosion, restore visual harmony of the area and re-creates habitat for some wildlife,” said Frimml. The BLM will continue to engage the community in future projects aimed at restoring and protecting public lands. Special thanks go out to the community members Liz Parker, Jim Parker, and Marcia Fagnant; BLM staff Jerry Frimml, Ben Molitor, Linda Goetz, Katie Patterson, Alisa Bartos, and Katie Goidich; and Forest Service representative Douglas Tingwall for their dedication and hard work in making this project a success. For more information about the BLM’s reclamation efforts or upcoming volunteer opportunities, please contact Jerry Frimml at the Kemmerer Field Office at 307-828-4508 or jfrimml@blm.gov. - BLM – The BLM manages more than 245 million acres of public land located primarily in 12 western states, including Alaska, on behalf of the American people.
