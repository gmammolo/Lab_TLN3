  "text": "WILLIAMSBURG, Mo. – University of Missouri Extension is taking to the skies to identify and map invasive weed species in one of mid-Missouri’s prized native prairie areas.\nMU Extension state natural resource specialist Michael Sunde is using drone-based lidar and imagery along with satellite imagery and machine learning to make 3D maps of vegetation and land cover at Prairie Fork Conservation Area, which is in eastern Callaway County near Williamsburg.\nData gathered during the two-year project will be extrapolated to create maps and 3D forest models to locate unwanted plant species.\nThis is the first time a drone has been used to make precision maps at the location, Sunde says. Aerial photos previously taken provided good information but lacked the detail that a drone flying closer to the ground can provide.\nThe information will help conservationists rid the natural prairie grasslands of two invasive weeds – bush honeysuckle and sericea lespedeza – that edge out preferred grasses.\nMU Extension’s Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP) assists with the Prairie Fork project to develop, analyze and deliver geospatial data for environmental resource planning and management.\nThe Prairie Fork Charitable Endowment supports the 711-acre Prairie Fork Conservation Area. It is managed by the MU School of Natural Resources and the Missouri Department of Conservation.\nPrairie Fork’s grasslands are treasured by conservationists and educators because only 5% of Missouri land remains as a natural prairie with diverse plants, wildlife and insect life. Prior to statehood in 1821, Missouri had at least 15 million acres of prairie grass, according to the Missouri Prairie Foundation.\nData extrapolated from aerial images will provide information that can help conservationists locate and eradicate invasive weeds in the natural grasslands at Prairie Fork Conservation Area.
