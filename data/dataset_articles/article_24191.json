  "text": "International supply chain and logistics leader Gebrüder Weiss raced into new territory, setting another record with this year’s GWcycles cycling campaign. With an international community of bike enthusiasts, more than 600 participants came together to cycle over 768,800 kilometers (477,710 miles) – the distance it would take to go to the moon and back.\nAn industry pioneer in the use of alternative drive technologies and sustainable practices, the logistics company ran its third and latest cycling campaign between March and September. Aptly titled “Cycling to the moon and back,” Gebrüder Weiss called on cyclists around the world to join its campaign by downloading the Radbonus app and covering as many kilometers as possible on two wheels.\nAnother benefit to the company’s annual cycling campaign is that each kilometer cycled helps to protect the climate. The 2024 cycling campaign has enabled Gebrüder Weiss to plant 7,000 new trees in the corporate forest in Nicaragua. A total of 19,000 trees have been planted since the campaign was launched in 2022. Once fully grown, these trees will absorb around 285 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere per year.",
