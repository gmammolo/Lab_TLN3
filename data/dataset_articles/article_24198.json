  "text": "A local sanctuary is stepping up in a big way to help after Helene.St. Francis Animal Sanctuary is based in Mandeville but is located in Mississippi.The organization is taking in displaced animals from two shelters that were flooded in Helene.The sanctuary already took in 35 animals so far.Jason Bolkon serves as the Director of Special Operations for the Sanctuary.He says they served as a regional hub after Hurricane Katrina and was happy to step in after this hurricane. \"The goal right now is to take as many animals as we can physically fit safely at the sanctuary until they don't need help anymore,\" Bolkon said. \"But from what I'm seeing, I suspect that they are going to be dealing with the aftermath of this for quite some time. It's bad.\"Please see the St. Francis Animal Sanctuary official website for ways you can donate or call 601-803-1256 for more information.",
