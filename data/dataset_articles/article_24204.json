At A Glance: - EIA posts 55 Bcf injection - Storage surplus narrows - LNG demand to increase By [Kevin Dobbs](/news/authors/kevin-dobbs/) Natural gas futures rallied on Thursday after a government inventory report confirmed a shrinking surplus of underground supply. For the first time in five sessions, natural gas futures advanced even as Hurricane Milton smacked western Florida late Wednesday and pushed across the state the following morning, knocking out power for millions of residents. Futures were lower much of Thursday but clawed out an afternoon relief rally. Utilities injected 82 Bcf of natural gas into storage for the week ended Oct. 4, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported on Thursday. Nationwide, winter heating bills should be similar to a year ago, but a colder winter forecast for the Midwest is likely to drive up costs for households that rely on natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Natural gas futures extended recent weakness in early trading Thursday as the market assessed damage from Hurricane Milton in Florida and prepared to receive another storage report that potentially could be seasonally light. Natural gas futures fell for a fourth consecutive session on Wednesday as the market braced for a historically powerful hurricane to pummel western Florida and potentially plunge power demand amid forecasts for disastrous winds and massive storm surges. Canadian producer Advantage Energy Ltd. said it could curtail as much as 130 MMcf/d of dry natural gas production in the Montney Shale and Doig formation until Alberta natural gas prices recover.
