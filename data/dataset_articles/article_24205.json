  "text": "Meet the farmer billionaire who wants you to do nothing about climate Johnny Kahlbetzer knows humans won’t change anything just for the planet’s sake, so he’s obsessed with backing technology that’s not only greener, but better and cheaper. [Michael Bailey](/by/michael-bailey-j67s5)Rich List co-editor I joke to Johnny Kahlbetzer that I’ve booked out Beppi’s just for us. When the relaxed-looking boss of the Twynam group walks in from his office around the corner, the Darlinghurst institution – founded by the late Beppi Polese in 1956 – is otherwise devoid of diners. The fact that it’s the first Monday of the NSW school holidays is no doubt to blame. Still, if the Polese family was really going to shut the place down for anyone, it may well be for a Kahlbetzer.
