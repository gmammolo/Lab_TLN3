Photo by Frank Lopez Written by [Frank Lopez](https://thebusinessjournal.com/byline/frank-lopez/) The owner of a national security company based in the Central Valley is offering a possible solution to help combat issues with tagging on buildings. Fresno-based AmeriGuard Security revealed a new product to try and help businesses and municipalities prevent damage on their buildings, as well as blight caused by homeless people. HydroGuard, which is currently going through the patent process, is a motion-sensor water spraying system that is activated when someone stands near the outer walls of a building. It can also be activated manually, as well through an autonomous artificial intelligence system that can differentiate between a dog walking by — or a person. The HydroGuard system can also be activated for a certain timeframe, such as after store closing hours, and the water can be set to spray as a deterrent for any increment of time. It can also be controlled through cellphone apps. Lawrence Garcia, president and CEO of AmeriGuard, said that the water would deter vandals, as well as homeless people, from loitering against outer walls. It leaves the ground wet, making it less desirable for individuals to place their belongings on the ground. “I feel this is a humane approach to get people to get away from the business and to take their activities somewhere else,” Garcia said. Garcia said he currently has the HydroGuard system set up at a local restaurant and a furniture store. The system also has a speaker sound that can be set up to project a pre-recorded message, live voice or any sound, such as thunder, he said. HydroGuard can be connected to a building’s AC and swamp cooler, and can also be powered by solar panels. Garcia said Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer has expressed interest in using the HydroGuard for city buildings. A city representative recently came out to see the system in action. He said that the California High Speed Rail Authority, whom AmeriGuard provides security for, likes HydroGuard, but is lacking a water source or the system. Garcia expects other businesses and municipalities to take interest in the product. “It’s going to be licensable, and I think other states and cities would like to try it. We can roll it out to Anytown U.S.A.,” Garcia said. He said the cost will depend on whether a building has a power and water source, but is trying to keep the costs as low as possible. HydroGuard isn’t a product he needs to sell at a high profit margin, but one that will see great returns when large quantities are sold. “What I’m trying to do is cover my costs, enough to just display it, get the City of Fresno to fall in love with it, and then get it out to other towns,” Garcia said. HydroGuard has a control valve sensor that can detect if there are water leaks or if it’s releasing more water than it’s supposed to, and notifies the owner. Big bids Along with expanding its arsenal of security services, AmeriGuard recently expanded a new contract with its non-emergency medical transportation service for veterans, TransportUS. As a veteran himself, Garcia noticed that many veterans have various medical issues and appointments, with many of them having no family members or friends to transport them. “It’s a growing need, and there’s a coming ‘silver tsunami’ in this industry, and we are happy to be involved,” Garcia said. In about the last four months, Garcia said TransportUS has gotten three new contracts in the Long Beach area, and is close to securing a contract in San Diego. TransportUS performs about 430 transports in a span of 24 hours with about 120 of their own vehicles. Just recently, TransporUS secured a contract with the Loma Linda University Health. Garcia said TransportUS was started six years ago and has grown very quickly, and he expects that growth to continue. [.](javascript:void(0);) [.](javascript:void(0);) [.](javascript:void(0);)",
