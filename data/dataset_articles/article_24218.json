  "text": "Cincinnati Zoo Fellows: The Next Generation of Wildlife Conservationists\nProspère TEBERD\nMeet Prospère TEBERD, a wildlife conservationist with a deep passion for studying primate behavior and preserving their habitats. Originally from Congo, Prospere currently works closely with gorillas while pursuing his masters in the U.S. When he’s not working in the field, you might catch him playing volleyball, strumming his guitar, or exploring new cultural perspectives on conservation. His long-term goal is to lead large-scale projects that balance protecting wildlife with improving local livelihoods across Africa.\nAs a Cincinnati Zoo Fellow, Prospère’s project focuses on promoting gorilla conservation through sustainable ecotourism and community engagement in northern Congo. By creating initiatives like revenue-sharing from ecotourism, environmental education, and job creation, he hopes to reduce human-wildlife conflict and foster long-term conservation efforts. For Prospere, coexistence means creating an environment where humans and wildlife thrive together, with solutions that benefit both. 🌍🦍\n#GorillaConservation #ConservationImpact #CZBGFellow\nMarisa Phringphroh (“Kie”)\nMarisa Phringphroh, or Kie as she’s known to friends, is a passionate field researcher from Thailand with a love for the great outdoors! Whether she’s trekking through the forest, camping under the stars, or birdwatching on the weekends, Kie is always seeking new ways to connect with nature. When she’s not outdoors, you can find her gardening or reading at home. Her work as a researcher with Bring The Elephant Home Foundation focuses on reducing elephant-caused crop damage through sustainable agriculture practices.\nKie’s Fellowship project is all about finding solutions for human-elephant coexistence. By exploring alternative crops that reduce crop damage, Kie hopes to create a future where both elephants and humans can thrive along the borders of national parks. For Kie, coexistence is about ensuring that both species benefit from shared spaces, creating safe zones where they can live, eat, and thrive together. 🐘🌾\n#ElephantConservation #CoexistenceInAction #CZBGFellow\nNatsuda Sutthiboriban (“Mo”)\nSay hello to Natsuda Sutthiboriban, also known as Mo! She’s an outdoor enthusiast who loves biking, running, and spending time with her pets. She steers clear of anything made with durian! Mo’s goal is to find ways for wildlife and people to coexist happily and safely, ensuring that both sides feel comfortable and secure. Through her research, she’s working to better understand how villagers living near forests can coexist peacefully with the elephants that roam nearby.\nMo’s Fellowship project focuses on studying elephant populations and their distribution in and around protected areas. By understanding where elephants are present and how they interact with local communities, she hopes to help foster positive relationships between humans and wildlife. For Mo, coexistence means more than just sharing space—it’s about creating an environment where both people and animals can live in harmony. 🐘🌿\n#ElephantResearch #HumanWildlifeCoexistence #CZBGFellow\nMariana Catapani\nFor Mariana Catapani, life is all about creating meaningful connections—both with the natural world and the people around her. In her free time, she enjoys escaping to her cabin in the forest, spending time with her three dogs, and getting lost in a good book. Mari is passionate about conservation and is driven by a desire to find inclusive and just solutions that foster a harmonious relationship between people and biodiversity.\nAs a Cincinnati Zoo Fellow, Mari works with the Wild Animal Conservation Institute (ICAS) in Brazil. Her project spans multiple areas, from reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions to creating a certified honey production initiative that supports over 100 beekeepers. She’s also leading efforts to improve domestic dog-wildlife interactions, address wildlife conflicts in urban areas, and collaborate on Pantanal wildfire policy. For Mari, coexistence means respecting both human and wildlife needs and finding sustainable ways for both to thrive. 🐾🌍\n#ConservationImpact #HumanWildlifeCoexistence #CZBGFellow\nKai Davis\nKai Davis is an outdoor enthusiast and sports lover with a passion for conservation! When he’s not on the basketball court or enjoying a good board game, Kai is working on projects that aim to benefit both wildlife and the environment. His goal is to find harmony between people, wildlife, and nature through science and conservation. For Kai, coexistence is more than just an ideal—it’s something we can strive toward by finding innovative solutions that benefit everyone involved.\nKai’s Fellowship project is focused on assessing the impact of restored habitats at Bowyer Farm on avian species. By studying which bird species are present, where they are found, and how they use the restored spaces, Kai’s research will help guide future restoration efforts. He’s also collaborating with the Cincinnati Parks Department to explore similar assessments in urban settings. His work is laying the foundation for understanding the impact of habitat restoration on wildlife and creating a brighter future for species across the region. 🐦🌿\n#HabitatRestoration #AvianConservation #CZBGFellow",
