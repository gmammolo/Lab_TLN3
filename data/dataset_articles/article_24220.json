  "text": "The UK’s BP has signed a shareholder agreement with SOCAR Green (a subsidiary of Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR) and the Azerbaijan Investment Company (AIC) for the development of the 240 MW Shafag solar power plant in the Jabrayil region of Azerbaijan. BP will own 50.01% of the Shafag (Jabrayil) Solar Limited (SJSL) joint venture, while SOCAR will own 39.99% and AIC 10%. The Shafag project is expected to pilot a new commercial structure called a “Virtual Power Transfer Arrangement”, which if implemented will enable the project to produce solar power and deliver it to the national power grid operator, AzerEnerji. AzerEnerji would then deliver an equivalent quantity of electricity to the Sangachal oil and gas terminal near Baku, which would in turn enable the terminal to use this renewable electricity for its energy needs. [Interested in Power Plants?](/research/power-plant-database.html) Enerdata has developed a market research service to screen, monitor and analyse the development of power generation assets. Power Plant Tracker offers an interactive database and a powerful search engine covering [power plants](/research/power-plant-database.html) worldwide – including both installed and planned capacities for renewables and fossil fuels.",
