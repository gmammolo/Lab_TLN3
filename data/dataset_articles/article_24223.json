  "text": "BOZEMAN, Mont. - The Stillwater Trailhead parking lot has reopened following repairs from severe damage caused by the 2022 flooding event. This trail, valued by hikers, backpackers, horseback riders, and hunters, welcomes visitors once again.\nTwo important bridges—Wounded Man and Flood Creek—on Stillwater Trail #24 have been successfully replaced and are now open. However, the Stillwater Gorge section continues to be closed, with a bypass trail available for hikers.\nIn the week of October 15th, crews will utilize helicopters to transport materials to construction sites. Visitors may encounter construction equipment and an increase in activity. Parking will be limited during this time due to the presence of construction equipment.\nLooking ahead, repair work on the Stillwater Road is slated for 2025. Additionally, more bridges in the Beartooth Ranger District require replacement due to flood damage.\nVisitors planning their adventures are encouraged to contact the Beartooth Ranger District Office at 406-446-2103 for the latest information on trail bridge conditions. This ensures safe and prepared visits to these scenic trails.",
