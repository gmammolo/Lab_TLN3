  "text": "A Fantastic Year for Mass Audubon’s 21st Annual Duck Derby October 03, 2024 On Saturday, September 28, 2024, Mass Audubon celebrated a milestone with its 21st Annual Duck Derby at Allens Pond. Under cloudy skies and a refreshing breeze, 3,007 rubber ducks raced on the incoming tide at Barney's Joy in hopes to secure first place. Racing Rubber Ducks Raises Critical Funds The race kicked off with an exciting launch where a crew of staff and volunteers worked together to drag the giant net full of ducks out into the channel and release them. This year's winner was pulled by none other than FUN 107's Christopher \"Gazelle\" Arsenault who [followed the event closely](https://fun107.com/mass-audubon-2024-duck-derby-results/) and posted a fun duck race video about the day. We are thrilled to report that duck sponsorship sales brought in over $20,000 to support Mass Audubon! Every dollar will go towards supporting our efforts to maintain [climate resilient habitats](/our-work/resilient-lands), strengthen our [ecological management programs](/our-work/birds-wildlife), and provide [access to nature for all](/our-work/equitable-access-to-nature). Congratulations to Our Grand Prize Winner We are excited to announce that Christine Munroe from Somerset, MA, is the Grand Prize winner of this year’s Duck Derby! Her duck, \"Ella Munroe,\" was the first to cross the finish line, securing the top spot in the race. A huge congratulations to Christine, as well as our runner-up and the \"Slacker Quacker\" winner! Thank you to everyone for your participation and continued support of Mass Audubon and Allens Pond. We couldn’t do it without you!
