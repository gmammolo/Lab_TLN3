  "text": "The Access Fund has released a statement about a climbing success story in New Hampshire where climbers have purchased a property that will secure access to a crag. Below is the statement, follow them on Instagram for more access news.\nAccess Fund and Central New Hampshire Climbers’ Association (CNHCA) have announced the purchase of a key parcel of land in Thornton, New Hampshire, to provide access to the popular Merriam Woods crag.\nMerriam Woods (sometimes known as Russell Crags) is one of the most recently developed crags in New Hampshire. Climbing even compared it to the iconic Rumney in terms of its potential for high-quality climbing and its natural setting.\nThe acquisition encompasses five acres of land that abuts the White Mountain National Forest and Merriam Woods—conservation land owned and managed by the town of Woodstock, New Hampshire. Use of the area is only expected to increase, and with that increase comes the need to develop sustainable climbing infrastructure.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Friends of Merriam Woods (@friends_of_merriam_woods)\n“We are excited to acquire this land and work to build a new parking lot,” says CNHCA President Jay Knower. “With the increasing popularity of Merriam Woods and the surrounding Russell Crags, this project will help alleviate potential issues caused by visitor use and foster good will among the community at large.”\nAccess to the crags around Woodstock has been a historical challenge. In the spring of 2023, discussions were underway between local climbers and the Woodstock Conservation Commission regarding the imperiled climbing access to Merriam Woods. One of the key concerns raised by local residents was the need for sufficient parking along the road to the crag.\nAround the same time, Knower connected with the sellers. “We noticed that this piece of land was the only privately held parcel near Merriam Woods,” says Knower. “So we approached the owners about purchasing it, figuring that it wouldn’t hurt to ask.” The owners agreed to sell their property to CNHCA and were very supportive of the organization’s plans to build a small parking lot for climbers and other recreationists at a new trailhead. The lot will address landowner concerns and provide an avenue for sharing up-to-date information about proper use of these areas.\n“Climbers from CNHCA and Access Fund spent a significant amount of time working with the town of Woodstock to keep climbing open and conserved at Merriam Woods,” says Brian Tickle, Access Fund’s national acquisitions director. “This acquisition is a reminder that sustainable climbing often requires infrastructure beyond just trails, staging areas, and fixed anchors, and it also serves as an example of climbers addressing the needs of neighboring landowners.”\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Access Fund (@accessfund)",
