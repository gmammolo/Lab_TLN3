  "text": "Posted Oct 3, 2024 5:03 pm. Last Updated Oct 3, 2024 5:16 pm. A park in Calgary’s Beltline neighbourhood has reopened to the public after significant redevelopment. The City of Calgary announced the official reopening of Humpy Hollow Park, located along the northwest corner of 17 Avenue SW and Centre Street, with a special celebration on Thursday. The city says the redevelopment has “transformed the Beltline park into a vibrant, welcoming space for residents to gather and socialize.” The new features post-redevelopment include better pedestrian access, an enclosed off-leash dog park, and a covered performing stage for events and social gatherings. The updated version of the park also features a new mural as part of the Beltline Urban Mural Project (BUMP). The changes were sparked by a community-led initiative to make better use of the space. The project cost $3.25M and the city says most of the funding came from the Beltline Community Investment Fund. “The Beltline Neighbourhoods Association (BNA), saw this park was unnoticed and under-utilized with a run-down playground and limited access from 17 Avenue,” says Coun. Courtney Walcott. “Now this space is home to a much-needed dog park and a covered stage and plaza, perfect for community events.” The park’s name came from a naming contest for school children in 1976. A 2020 city-led public engagement suggested residents wanted to keep the name. While the work on the park is finished, work on the historic McHugh House tied to the park is ongoing. The house was built in 1896 and is one of the oldest buildings in Calgary. It was relocated to the east side of the park from its original location on 18 Avenue SW. Humpy Hollow Park is open every day from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m.",
