  "text": "Seventh ocelot ID'd in AZ over last 2 decades is captured on video A trail camera in southern Arizona has captured new video footage of a rare wild ocelot. The footage was recorded on a camera on July 24 in a [Sky Island mountain range](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/05/20/arizona-sky-islands-ecosystem-at-risk/72687306007/) in southern Arizona, in a place where researchers have not recently found ocelots. The Center for Biological Diversity released the video on Thursday, though for the safety of the cat, did not specify the exact location. The center confirmed that this ocelot is the same animal [researchers from the Phoenix Zoo identified](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/08/12/phoenix-zoo-researcher-spots-an-ocelot-on-southern-arizona-trail-cam/74741639007/) six weeks earlier in the Atascosa Highlands west of Nogales. The center consulted with several experts — including the Northern Jaguar Project’s Carmina Gutiérrez González — in making that confirmation. To reach the center’s trail camera in July, the ocelot would have crossed the Santa Cruz River [in a stretch under study to become a national wildlife refuge](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/09/22/santa-cruz-river-close-to-becoming-urban-wildlife-refuge/74224143007/), and crossed Interstate 19. The total journey exceeded 30 miles, according to the center. The center noted the importance of keeping ocelot travel corridors and overall habitat unfractured. “Ocelots rely on the intact, interconnected wildlands of the Sky Islands,\" the center said in a release. \"The fragmentation of their habitat due to roads, urban sprawl, mines and border barriers is a serious challenge to their survival. In Sonora, Mexico, ongoing construction of a freight railway between Imurís and Nogales is ripping through crucial ocelot breeding habitat, posing another threat to the imperiled species.” Rare cats: [Ocelots try to survive in a world that barely knows they exist](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2017/11/21/ocelots-try-survive-world-barely-knows-they-exist/824032001/) Fewer than 100 ocelots remain in the US Ocelots in the United States once roamed in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Arizona, but over a century of hunting, trapping, poisoning and habitat loss have greatly reduced their range and population size, according to the Nature Conservancy. Fewer than 100 ocelots are thought to remain in the United States, with the majority residing in southern Texas. The species has been protected under the Endangered Species Act since 1982. Arizona is home to a small but crucial population of ocelots, which exists at the northernmost part of the species' range. The cat in the latest footage is the seventh individual identified in Arizona over the last two decades. Outside the United States, ocelots range throughout the Americas, extending all the way to northern Argentina. Last assessed in 2014, the ocelot was classified globally as a species of “least concern” on the IUCN Red List, though its population was declining. Russ McSpadden, a Southwest conservation advocate at the center, said in Thursday’s release that the Sky Island ranges in southern Arizona have proven to be a suitable habitat for ocelots. “I shouted with joy when I realized what I was seeing on the trail cam. This incredible footage shows us that ocelots belong in our Sky Islands, despite all the threats they face,” McSpadden said in Thursday’s release. The Sky Islands are a[ series of isolated mountain ranges](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2024/05/20/arizona-sky-islands-ecosystem-at-risk/72687306007/) that rise from the desert floor in northern Mexico and southern Arizona. The ranges include unique ecosystems that support a high diversity of plants and animals. The ranges serve as important habitat corridors for species like the ocelot, jaguar and black bear, enabling them to move widely in search of food, mates and shelter. Austin Nunez, chairman of the San Xavier District of the Tohono O’odham Nation, described the significance of protecting the Sky Islands for the sake of humans and ocelots alike. The ranges stretch across the Tohono O'odham people's ancestral homelands. “The Sky Island Mountains are not just beautiful landscapes; they are living parts of our culture and identity,” Nunez said in the release. “Seeing the return of an ocelot to these ancestral lands reaffirms our sacred connection to this place and reminds us of our duty to protect these lands and the creatures that depend on them. The ocelot’s survival is intertwined with ours, and we must ensure that this species endures for future generations.” Austin Corona covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.
