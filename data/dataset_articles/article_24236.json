  "text": "Mass Audubon Names Nathan Senner as New Gerard A. Bertrand Chair of Natural History and Field Ornithology Press Release October 03, 2024 Mass Audubon, the largest nature-based organization in New England, has chosen University of Massachusetts Amherst Assistant Professor Dr. Nathan Senner as its next Gerard A. Bertrand Chair of Natural History and Field Ornithology. Senner, an Assistant Professor in UMass Amherst’s Department of Environmental Conservation, and his lab focus on understanding how organisms respond to environmental change to better help conserve threatened and endangered species. Most of the lab’s research involves long-distance migratory shorebirds, a collection of species that are declining more rapidly than nearly any other group in the world. The lab uses miniaturized tracking devices to follow these shorebirds on their epic, trans-hemispheric flights and works to turn this information into on-the-ground conservation action. The Bertrand Chair position is held by a leading expert in bird study and conservation and is named after Gerard A. Bertrand, a prominent figure in the field of ornithology and conservation, who served as the President of Mass Audubon for nearly two decades. Senner replaces Joan Walsh, who held the role since 2017. “Dr. Senner is not only an expert in the field whose research helps conserve threatened species, he also understands the necessity of conserving our biodiversity and gaining broad public support to fight the negative impacts of climate change on crucial habitat,” said Chief Conservation Officer Jocelyn Forbush. “He is an invaluable addition to Mass Audubon and we’re excited to have him in this role.” Senner’s love of birds began when he was a small child and continued into his time at Carleton College, where he was awarded the opportunity to follow Hudsonian Godwits, a long-distance migratory shorebird, on their annual migration from the Arctic to South America. He went on to earn a PhD at Cornell University and followed that up with postdoctoral work at the University of Groningen and at the University of Montana. When he’s not at work, Senner trains with his dog and running partner, Oliver, who is three-time champion of the Snow Joke Half Marathon. “Joining Mass Audubon as the Bertrand Chair is a terrific opportunity that I’m looking forward to immensely,” Senner said. “Migratory shorebird populations are facing nothing short of a crisis, so teaming with Mass Audubon to support their coastal waterbird efforts is a vital next step.” To learn more about Mass Audubon’s Coastal Waterbird program, visit [massaudubon.org/our-work/birds-wildlife/coastal-waterbirds](/our-work/birds-wildlife/coastal-waterbirds). About Mass Audubon Mass Audubon is the largest nature-based conservation organization in New England. Founded in 1896 by two women who fought for the protection of birds, Mass Audubon carries on their legacy by focusing on the greatest challenges facing the environment today: the loss of biodiversity, inequitable access to nature, and climate change. With the help of our 160,000 members and supporters, we protect wildlife, conserve and restore resilient land, advocate for impactful environmental policies, offer nationally recognized education programs for adults and children, and provide endless opportunities to experience the outdoors at our wildlife sanctuaries.
