She says older people bring a different perspective. “It’s the age of gratitude where you’ve lost enough so you’re really grateful for what’s left, whether that’s a husband or a child or it’s that you used to hear whip-poor-wills and now you don’t, you used to see spotted turtles and now you don’t,” Susan adds. Susan started OLAUG with a few friends during the pandemic. Today, her group is 25 strong and she has a waiting list of women who want to collect trash with her.

And it’s a hell of a lot easier to scale up joy than it is to scale up sacrifice.” “It’s the Zen of trash picking,” she adds. OLAUG works with one kayaker for every two swimmers.
