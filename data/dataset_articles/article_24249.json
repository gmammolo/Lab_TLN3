  "text": "OSSINEKE, MI – There’s a place in Northern Michigan where you can walk among life-size dinosaurs that have stood for decades surrounded by low-land ferns and majestic trees. Dinosaur Gardens in Ossineke is a prehistoric zoo of more than 25 prehistoric creatures along a half-mile garden path, according to the website. The “cement-plastic” dinosaurs, the labor of love of founder Paul Domke, were built between 1935 and 1967. “Dinosaur Gardens is a fun roadside attraction located just south of Alpena in Ossineke and offers numerous life-size dinosaurs around the park for kids and adults to enjoy,” according to Visit Alpena . Domke purchased the land for his prehistoric zoo in 1930, during the Great Depression, according to Dinosaur Gardens. He thought it “resembled the type of terrain that was inhabited by dinosaurs when they roamed the earth,” according to Dinosaur Gardens. “When you walk through the property today, you can see why he chose this site for his future labor of love. It is loaded with huge, low land ferns, majestic trees and a natural stream running through it that is full of history and wildlife.” From 1930 to 1932, he built a home, three rental cabins and a gas station/art studio, according to Dinosaur Gardens. Work on the park and the first dinosaurs began in 1935. He had a bridge built over Devils River, cleared areas of the land, and made ready for future creatures. After failures with materials that didn’t withstand the outdoors, Domke partnered with Huron Portland Cement Company to create cement-plastic, which is made from cement, sand, lime, calcium, stearate and liquid asphalt, according to Dinosaur Gardens. Each creature started with a cement foundation and a metal skeleton, according to Dinosaur Gardens. The cement-plastic was pliable and allowed Domke to sculpt the details of each dinosaur. He took several trips to the Smithsonian and other museums to gather information about the correct size and appearance of each dinosaur. The real-life versions of the creatures at the park roamed the Earth from 200 million to 34 million years and come from all over the world. Owners Gary and Connie Stephan purchased Dinosaur Gardens in 2013. They put their stamp on the property by renovating the gift shop and adding an ice cream bar. Experiences at the park include a self-guided walking tour among the dinosaurs, a fossil dig, a miner’s sluice and mini-golf. Walking tour admission is $10. There are bundles and a-la-carte options for the other activities. Find Dinosaur Gardens at 11160 U.S. 23 in Ossineke.",
