  "text": "With fall come the declining temperatures, shorter daylight periods and (finally!) moisture in the soil. These conditions signal that it’s nearly tree planting season here in the Midsouth. Though trees can be successfully installed all year-round, mid-October through winter dormancy is the very best time. Why so?\nEntering and during dormancy, plants are generally under less stress to conduct water, build cells and fight pests. So, a relocation — even of a tree container-grown tree — is generally less stressful in cooler months. More importantly, the majority of landscape-sized trees (let’s say two- to fourth-inch caliper trunks) are not container-grown but, rather, are machine-harvested from nursery fields.\nThe best growers in-field root pruning but even with good cultivation practices, the transplanting process doesn’t capture the entire of a tree’s root mass in those truncated earth balls you see wrapped in burlap and secured with wire baskets. So, a transplant has suffered root loss plus the traumas of excavation, handling and re-installation. These invasions are less impactful if trees are, otherwise, under reduced environmental stress.\nAnd so, if the past few weeks of heat and drought have you thinking more shade is a good idea, if you’d like to create a visual screen, or maybe you’re looking for habitat or aesthetic interest, it’s go time! Start with a professional landscape designer or architect who can recommend the right trees in the right places.\nSomeone who not only knows plant material and how to evaluate site conditions, but also understands scale and space and listens to your ideas and thoughts, as well. A good design will take into account soil types, moisture conditions, drainage and utility easements, tree compatibilities and more. Don’t forget to consider natives like oak, maple, hickory, black gum, dogwood and serviceberry as first choices.\nLastly, the right installation is critical. Those of us who have spent a great amount of time in the industry have found that people — not pests, disease or weather — are responsible for most transplant failure of healthy trees. The most frequent mistakes I see landscapers make include planting at improper grade and over-mulching. Ideally for most trees, top of the earth ball should be set approximately two inches above the surrounding finished grade.\nThis setting properly positions the root flare (the large structural roots extending from the trunk) and allows for two to three inches of an organic mulch placement. It’s common to see failing or weak trees that were installed too deeply — depriving the roots of oxygen — and mulched in a “volcano” form which creates wet bark and the opportunity for pathogens and insects to compromise plant health.\nThere’s always more to say than there is space. And, as always, Holly Consults is happy to help in the design and implementation of your next project!",
