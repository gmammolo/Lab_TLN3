  "text": "TRNP wild horse advocates share petition to stop the roundup BISMARCK, N.D. (KFYR) - Theodore Roosevelt National Park officials announced on Friday staff will be [rounding up the park’s bison and horses to transfer them to tribes or new homes](https://www.kfyrtv.com/2024/09/27/theodore-roosevelt-national-park-roundup-bison-horses-transfer/). But wild horse advocates say they’re still concerned about the legacy of the horses, despite making progress with the park. Park officials say the transfer is “to support healthy herds as well as park ecosystems.” They say mares that have not responded to contraception and their offspring will be put up for adoption. However, advocates say removing fertile horses from the park will make it challenging or impossible to carry on the herd. Chris Kman is one of those advocates working with the park to control and minimize sterilization, among other things. “Our organization has a petition. We’ve gotten over 2,500 signatures since Sunday. We’re trying to get Senator Hoeven’s attention because he’s been such a strong advocate for these horses. We hope that we can continue to count on him. There’s no reason this roundup can’t wait until next fall,” said Kman. She said the park’s actions have eroded her trust in the organization. She said it’ll also be difficult to find people to adopt some of the older horses. You can learn more [here](https://secure.everyaction.com/4dmUjJg8pk2-feWZLe8-pg2). Copyright 2024 KFYR.
