Let’s come together to ensure that every creature feels safe and loved in the world we all inhabit, says SAKSHI PRIYA On World Animal Day, we are reminded of a simple yet profound truth: animals share our world and in many ways, they reflect the best parts of ourselves. As we go about our lives, it’s easy to forget the loyalty, grace and beauty that animals bring to this planet. Whether it’s the silent strength of a tiger in the wild or the trusting eyes of a stray dog, animals have a way of touching our hearts. As the author Anthony Douglas Williams once said, “We have more to learn from animals than animals have to learn from us.” Their unconditional love, resilience and ability to live harmoniously with nature offer us lessons in compassion, humility and care. October 4th, World Animal Day, is a time to highlight the pressing issues that animals face across the globe. The theme for this year, “The World is Their Home Too,” is a powerful call for all of us to recognise the rights of animals, whether they are roaming freely in the wilderness or wandering the streets as strays. This day is a chance to reflect on how we treat the creatures that share our planet and to realise that they, too, deserve safety, respect and love. From the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger to the critically endangered Indian Rhinoceros, the wildlife in India is under constant threat. Habitat destruction, poaching and human-wildlife conflict have left these species teetering on the edge of survival. The tiger, once a symbol of untamed power, now roams in small, fragmented patches of forest. The Indian Rhinoceros, whose numbers were once decimated by hunting, faces the constant pressure of habitat loss and illegal poaching for its horn. Similarly, the Asiatic Lion, which now has a population of approximately 600 individuals confined to the Gir Forest, faces an uncertain future in its last remaining natural habitat. This small population survives in a limited area, making them vulnerable to catastrophic events like disease outbreaks or forest fires, which could wipe them out forever. These creatures, emblematic of India’s natural heritage, are not merely animals, they are vital parts of ecosystems that sustain life, including our own. Yet, it’s not only the rare and exotic species that require our attention. Animals that live closer to us, whether they are stray dogs, cattle, or even birds, also face significant challenges. Stray dogs, in particular, bear the brunt of urban neglect. But beyond the dogs, there are countless other animals like cows left to fend for themselves on the streets, often injured or malnourished. Birds, too, struggle as cities expand, with sparrows and other species losing their nesting grounds due to rapid urbanisation. Even marine life along India’s coasts is impacted by pollution and overfishing, with turtles, dolphins, and many fish species facing increasingly hostile environments. One of the most critical actions we can take for all animals is to reconsider how we interact with them. Whether it’s making sustainable choices that protect natural habitats or supporting animal shelters and rehabilitation centres, we each have a role to play. Conservation efforts like Project Tiger, Project Elephant and initiatives to protect the Great Indian Bustard are crucial but they need greater public backing. Beyond government initiatives, we as individuals can contribute by supporting wildlife sanctuaries, participating in reforestation efforts and making more conscious decisions that minimise harm to animal habitats. For animals closer to home, adopting stray dogs, cats or even cows from shelters is one of the most compassionate things we can do. These animals, often ignored, deserve a second chance at life. Rather than purchasing pets, adopting from shelters not only saves lives but helps reduce the suffering caused by overpopulation. We must also push for stronger laws against animal cruelty and promote humane population control measures for stray animals, such as spay and neuter programmes. On this day, let’s broaden our perspective. Let’s not just think about the wild animals in distant forests or the pets in our homes. Let’s consider all the creatures that make up our world: the birds, the cattle, the marine life and the strays and how each one plays a vital role in the delicate balance of life on Earth. Every action we take, no matter how small, contributes to creating a better world for them. As we observe World Animal Day, let's remember that the answer for stray animals begins with a simple yet profound action: adopt, don’t shop. Every stray dog on the street is a potential companion, waiting for a family. By adopting a stray, you give an animal a second chance at life and the warmth of a loving home. This small act not only transforms their lives but also enriches yours with unique love and companionship. Every life saved reflects our compassion for these deserving souls. The world is their home too and together, we can ensure that every animal feels safe, loved, and valued. Books to celebrate World Animal Day The Gopi Diaries is a charming series for children by Sudha Murty, published by Harper Children's. The series follows Gopi, a lovable pup. In Coming Home, Gopi is adopted by a loving family and quickly learns about his new world. In Finding Love, he grows stronger and cheekier, facing new challenges and meeting exciting dog companions. Finally, in Growing Up, Gopi matures and welcomes a new friend, Nova, into his life. Warrior Queens of Ranthambore by Manish Kalani, is a unique coffee table book that captures the journey of five generations of tigresses in Ranthambore National Park. Featuring over 500 photographs taken over eight years, wildlife photographer Manish Kalani tells the story of the legendary tigress Machhli and her descendants, highlighting their beauty, strength and emotional bonds. The book emphasises the importance of tiger conservation and serves as a significant addition to wildlife literature in India. Mountain Mammals of the World by M.K. Ranjitsinh, published by Penguin Ebury Press, is a definitive guide that explores the larger mammals inhabiting mountainous regions globally. The book features detailed profiles of approximately 62 species and 78 subspecies, highlighting their behaviour, ecology and conservation status.

The book showcases the country's diverse landscapes and wildlife, featuring travel tips, must-see places, and captivating photographs.

Wildlife India @ 50: Saving the Wild, Securing the Future by Manoj Misra (Publisher: Rupa) commemorates 50 years of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The book chronicles India's wildlife conservation journey, reflecting on successes and missed opportunities through contributions from various experts.
