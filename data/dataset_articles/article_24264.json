  "text": "BlueGreen Alliance Celebrates New Investment to Expand Clean Transmission in the United States October 3, 2024 The U.S. Department of Energy today allocated $1.5 billion for four transmission projects across Maine, Oklahoma, New Mexico and the Southeast. These projects are funded by the Transmission Facilitation Program in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The investment will help spur 1,000 miles of new transmission lines across six states that are expected to transmit an additional 7,100 megawatts of electricity. Following the announcement, the BlueGreen Alliance issued a statement from Executive Director Jason Walsh: “We need more clean energy right now to power the clean economy. The Biden-Harris administration’s Invest in America agenda is ensuring we have a resilient grid with enough capacity to support critical industries and renewable energy growth through strategic federal investments into transmission infrastructure. Expanding clean transmission across the country will not only lower carbon emissions—it also creates good paying jobs to build a more reliable grid.”",
