  "text": "As part of the Dust-free Delhi drive launched in the national capital on the instructions and under the guidance of Lt Governor VK Saxena, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is making a continued and substantial contribution, removing over 6156.94 metric tons (MT) of silt and C&D waste/ malba from the city since September 24, Raj Niwas said here on Thursday.Giving details of the ongoing effort, officials said MCD’s 12 zones collectively had removed 404.65 MT of waste on September 24 and October 2, it was able to remove 6156.94 metric tons (MT) of silt and construction and demolition (C&D) waste. The Shahdara South Zone continued to demonstrate the most significant progress since September 24 removing a combined total of 1230.76 MT in last 10 days. Keshapuram zone was next and it was also able to remove 1019.67 MT of waste by October two. The removed silt and C&D waste is being safely transported to designated dumping sites for proper disposal and bio-remediation. While this initial effort of removing the silt from various choked drains is in progress and encouraging, the road ahead remains tough. It may be recalled Saxena, who had in a meeting to review air pollution on September 20 stressed upon preparedness for mitigating it, well in advance. He had asked the MCD, PWD, NDMC, I&FCD and DJB to take up a Dust-free Delhi drive over the next one week / 10 days and asked for the same to be converted into a year-long campaign. Pollution caused by road dust is one of the two major contributors to air pollution in Delhi, and with the rains having stopped, dried up mud/ silt accumulated on roads is flying high in the environment causing major air pollution.",
