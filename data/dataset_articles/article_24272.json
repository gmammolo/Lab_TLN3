  "text": "OAKLAND — Garrett County has a wealth of scenic destinations nestled within its hills and mountains, ranging from the historically significant to the naturally beautiful, from town centers to wooded seclusion. Swallow Falls North of Oakland, Swallow Falls State Park is home to some of Maryland’s most breathtaking scenery and several waterfalls. The Youghiogheny River flows into the park, passing through shaded rocky gorges and creating small rapids. The river rolls over Tolliver Falls and Upper and Lower Swallow Falls. Facing the lower falls, Muddy Creek joins the Youghiogheny after plunging 53 feet. A 1.25-mile trail through the park guides hikers past the water and through tall hemlocks. From downtown Oakland, travel on Liberty Street until it becomes Herrington Manor Road. The park is nine miles north of town. Casselman River Bridge The Casselman River Bridge near Grantsville is an 80-foot span erected in 1813. At the time, it was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in the United States. It served as an important link on the National Road through 1933. Although it no longer carries vehicular traffic, it is open to pedestrians. Casselman River Bridge State Park is a four-acre parcel, popular for picnicking, fly fishing and photography. From I-68, take Exit 19 at Grantsville and drive to U.S. 40 Alternate/Main Street. The bridge is one mile to the east. Museum triangle The downtown Oakland area features a trio of museums: The Garrett County Historical Museum, the Garrett County Museum of Transportation and the Oakland B&O Museum. The former railroad station is a favorite spot for outdoor portrait photography. The 1884 building is considered to be one of the best examples of the Queen Anne style used in many of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad stations. In front of the station is a full-sized display of railway history. In 2018, a restored 1920 Baldwin steam locomotive and tender were added to the caboose and boxcar. The station is located on Liberty Street in Oakland, with the transportation museum across the street and the historical museum at the nearby intersection. Barn quilts Visitors to Garrett County can explore its scenic beauty, pastoral communities and rich farming heritage any time of the year by following the Barn Quilt Trail — which now boasts 45 colorful creations. The “quilts” are not actually made of fabric. Instead, colorful traditional and original quilt block designs are painted on 8-foot-by-8-foot (or smaller) pieces of aluminum composite material and mounted with screws on the sides of barns. Each structure showcases one quilt square or “block.” Quilt enthusiasts will recognize such well-known designs as Rose of Sharon, Double Wedding Ring, Turkey Tracks, Flying Geese and Log Cabin. Details about the barn quilt blocks and a map of the trail can be found at [garrettbarnquilts.org](http://garrettbarnquilts.org). Deep Creek Lake The heart of tourism in Garrett County, Deep Creek Lake features retail and dining establishments and rental units. Boating and fishing are part of the available outdoor activities. The man-made lake covers approximately 3,900 acres and has 69 miles of shoreline. Its depths contain yellow perch, walleye, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass. Motorized and non-motorized vessels, as well as personal watercraft, are permitted. Deep Creek Lake is easily accessible by taking Exit 14 from I-68 to U.S. 219 and traveling south for 17 miles. Highest point in Maryland The eastern edge of the state meets the Atlantic Ocean at sea level, but the western end contains the highest point in Maryland at an elevation of 3,360 feet. Hoye-Crest is a summit along Backbone Mountain just inside Garrett County, providing a view of the North Branch Potomac River Valley. There is no vehicular access, but the Maryland High Point Trail starts at U.S. 219 just south of Silver Lake, W.Va. The trail ascends the mountain for a mile along an old logging road through the Monongahela National Forest to the state line. The trail then heads north along the state line to the high point. The crest is on private property, but access is permitted. Oakland murals Art can be seen in a big way in downtown Oakland with several murals that have been painted on the sides of buildings. Each highlights a facet of the local community — history, commerce, transportation and safety. On the rear of the Garrett County Museum of Transportation on East Liberty Street is a collection of post-card-style pictures commemorating life in different areas of Garrett County, such as Mountain Lake Park, Deer Park and Deep Creek Lake. In the parking lot beside the Oakland Volunteer Fire Department on South Third Street is a strip in the style of Roy Lichtenstein in tribute to public safety. At the rear of The Garrett County Republican newspaper office on East Green Street is a display of B&O Railroad history centered on a portrait of John W. Garrett, the railroad’s president during its pre-Civil War construction. Facing that mural across the parking lot is another featuring famous visitors to the county, including Albert Einstein, Buffalo Bill Cody and the “Vagabonds” trip of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Harvey Firestone. State forests State forest land is available in Garrett County for outdoor recreation, from hiking to fishing. Potomac Garrett State Forest is 10,488 acres in the southeastern corner off Md. 135. Garrett State Forest is 8,144 acres located five miles northwest of Oakland along U.S. 219. In the central and eastern parts of the county, the Savage River State Forest has 55,155 acres generally south of U.S. 40 and surrounding the Savage River Reservoir. These forests contain a wide variety of trees, plentiful wildlife and breathtaking scenery.",
