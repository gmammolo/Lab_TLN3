  "text": "Computer fight turns deadly: Teen stabs grandmother, injures mother in NY home\nA 15-year-old Long Island boy allegedly killed his grandmother and injured his mother after a dispute over his computer. Police say the teen was caught with bloodied knives hours later.\nIn Short\n- 15-year-old attacked family over computer threat\n- Mother critically injured, grandmother killed\n- Charged with murder and attempted murder\nThe 15-year-old allegedly became violent after his family threatened to take away his computer. His mother, Vanessa Chendrmi, was critically injured in the attack.\nAccording to Suffolk County police, Vanessa was seen running out of her home around 10 p.m. on Monday. She got into the vehicle of a passing driver, and they called 911.\nFirst responders later discovered the body of Vanessa’s 56-year-old mother with multiple stab wounds. Prosecutors said Vanessa pretended to be dead on the floor after being stabbed. She was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.\nAuthorities said the teenager fled the scene but was caught about two hours later. His hands were reportedly covered in blood, and police recovered two kitchen knives stained with blood.\nThe boy was arraigned in First District Court in Central Islip on Tuesday on charges of murder and attempted murder. His identity has not been released due to his age.\nWhy did the boy stab his family?\nProsecutors stated that the teen had been acting out in recent days. He had missed school and confined himself into his room with his computer. The grandmother reportedly told the boy's mother to just take away his computer, which allegedly triggered the attack. The grandmother was stabbed multiple times in the torso and leg.\nDuring the court appearance, the boy said nothing. A family member declined to comment on the case, according to NBC.",
