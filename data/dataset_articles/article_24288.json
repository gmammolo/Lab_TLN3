  "text": "Hold.earth, an emissions offsetting start-up that helps companies offset CO2 emissions through sustainable forest restoration projects, received its first carbon credits for a forestry project a few months ago in Lithuania . This recognition indicates that the company is in the top 1%. of all green projects certified in Europe in the forestry projects category. High-quality certified carbon credits are provided by the Open Forest Protocol platform, known for its stringent requirements.\nIn recent years the startup, in collaboration with several companies, has planted more than 50 hectares of new forests in Lithuania, which comply with local environmental regulations and are registered on the Open Forest Protocol platform. According to Greta Šidlauskienė, co-founder and head of the startup, the granted carbon credits will allow the company to expand into new markets and will help companies around the world obtain certified carbon credits that meet the strict standards of the Open Forest Protocol.\n“This certificate is the result of three years, which we achieved by implementing continuous monitoring and reporting methods in our projects, monitoring tree growth, survival rates, biomass and soil carbon levels,” says G. Šidlauskienė. – Our goal is to plant at least 100 hectares of new forests every year and actively expand the scope of project certification. Until 2050 we will aim to offset 10 million tonnes of carbon every year, which means we will plant more than 2 million trees per year.”\nThe startup works with large and medium-sized companies in the industrial, logistics and energy sectors looking to reduce their carbon footprint and implement sustainable climate solutions. During the project, all responsibility for forest management lies with the startup and companies engage in the project by participating in team-level training events, receiving certified carbon credits and reputational benefits, and having a real impact on the environment.\nThe Swiss Open Forest Protocol platform validates and issues carbon credits. To be certified, the project must last at least 40 years and the developer must be entitled to land ownership and carbon credits for the life of the project. At the request of the certifying authority, local plant species must be planted during the projects, avoiding plantations of the same species, and the trees must be adequately distributed throughout the project field. It can take up to three years to prepare a project to Open Forest Protocol standards, three months to obtain a certificate and 12 months to generate credits.\nCredible solutions for offsetting carbon emissions are still lacking The carbon offsetting credit system works according to a simple principle: every ton of CO2 released into the environment must be offset with the corresponding number of carbon credits. Offsetting is done by planting trees or locking up blue carbon in the ocean or coastal ecosystems. However, according to G. Šidlauskienė, there is still a lack of reliable solutions that can actually help compensate for exhaust gases.\n“Companies often cannot provide accurate compensation data because the projects are not viable or long-term. Therefore, investments in unproven carbon offsetting initiatives are not sustainable. Certified projects represent only about 20-30% . global reforestation and restoration initiatives. Certification ensures sustainability, biodiversity and carbon sequestration,” says the company head.\nAlthough Europe generates a smaller share of certified projects than Africa or Latin America, the quality of the initiatives themselves is significantly higher. In Europe, carbon credit prices are higher than the global average and range from 30 euros per ton. The price is determined by stricter legislation, high environmental standards and high business demand. According to G. Šidlauskienė, prices will increase in the future due to the entry into force of EU regulations and the growing desire of companies to achieve carbon neutrality goals. Currently, the price of credits for the company’s projects is around 36 euros per tonne/one carbon dioxide credit.\nHowever, although such initiatives and their real impact on the environment are often viewed with skepticism due to a lack of transparency and various examples of “greenwashing” projects in Africa and Latin America, companies are increasingly taking on social and environmental responsibilities . This is also confirmed by the startup’s growing customer base – 100% fixed from 2022. customer growth.\n“From 2022 until 2024 sales of afforestation projects have increased significantly. Businesses are looking for reliable investment opportunities and we are opening up a whole new market for quality credit in Europe. Although we manage projects from start to finish, we allow the company to be actively involved in the entire planting process and make sure that the forest not only grows, but is maintained for many years to come.\nTherefore, in the coming years we intend to carry out new reforestation projects and implement the latest monitoring technologies, – says the startup’s manager. “Additionally, as a strategic partner of the Open Forest Protocol platform, we will search for suitable land in Europe for forestry projects and certifications, thus expanding the network of sustainable projects across the region.”\nwindow.fbAsyncInit = function() {\nFB.init({\nappId: ‘117218911630016’,\nversion: ‘v2.10’,\nstatus: true,\ncookie: false,\nxfbml: true\n});\n};\n(function(d, s, id) {\nvar js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\nif (d.getElementById(id)) {\nreturn;\n}\njs = d.createElement(s);\njs.id = id;\njs.src = “https://connect.facebook.net/lt_LT/sdk.js”;\nfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n}(document, ‘script’, ‘facebook-jssdk’));\n#startup #receive #carbon #credits #Europe #plans #plant #million #trees #summer #trees #year #Commercial #activity\n2024-10-03 23:34:07",
