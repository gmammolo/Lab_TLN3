  "text": "Far-right influencer Laura Loomer urges Trump to ban Chinese students in US\nFar-right commentator Laura Loomer urged Trump to ban all Chinese students in the US. Her remark came as Trump paused tariffs for 90 days but raised China's to 125%.\nIn Short\n- Laura Loomer urges Trump to ban Chinese students from US.\n- Loomer's comment follows US-China tariff tensions.\n- Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause, and raised tariffs on China.\nFar-right political commentator Laura Loomer has called on former US President Donald Trump to ban all Chinese students from studying in the United States.\nIn a post shared on the microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Loomer wrote, \"President Trump should cancel ALL Chinese student visas immediately!\"\nLaura Loomer is a right-wing extremist and political commentator whose social media presence has made her famous. She seemed to have been sidelined at times by Donald Trump's election campaign.\nBut she has had the ear of the US president for years and might still have it. Her comment comes amid the ongoing US-China tariff war.\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES 90-DAY TARIFF PAUSE, BUT HIKES CHINA TARIFF TO 125%\nUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday declared a 90-day suspension of his reciprocal tariff, only 24 hours after it was implemented, raising concerns of a full-blown trade war. But he declared an immediate hike in tariffs on China to 125 per cent from the earlier announced 104 per cent.\nEarlier, the United States imposed a whopping 104 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, increasing tensions between the world's two biggest economies and causing widespread market shudders. The White House confirmed that the new tariff regime - in place from April 9 - fulfills President Donald Trump's threat to Beijing to reverse its retaliatory 34 per cent tariffs on US goods.\nIn response, China announced retaliatory tariffs of 84% on US goods imports on Wednesday, equal to extra tariffs put in place by US President Donald Trump earlier that day and fuelling further a trade war between the world's two largest economies.\nThe trade war expanded on Wednesday after the European Union declared it would start charging retaliatory duties on US imports from Tuesday.\nALSO READ: Who is Laura Loomer?
