  "text": "Contents\nThe autumn landscape can be a most breathtaking scene to behold. Trees change their leaves to shades of crimson, mahogany, bronze, and gold, rolling over hillsides and lighting up the sky. Paired with the cooling temperatures and holiday anticipation, it’s truly an enchanting time to be outdoors enjoying nature.\nWhen it comes to fall color , not all trees are equal. Scientific reactions are responsible for those vivid hues. As the equinox passes and we see fewer daylight hours, the decrease in daylight means less photosynthesis .\nThe decrease in photosynthesis means that the tree produces less chlorophyll . When you see those brilliant shades of yellow and orange , you see the color of the leaves without chlorophyll. Some leaves are brighter underneath than others, which simply turn brown.\nShades of red and violet appear because of the presence of anthocyanins , which develop when sugars get trapped in the leaves. Maples, oaks, and dogwood trees are likely to produce these colors.\nScience aside, autumn leaves are one of my favorite things about the season. Not only are they beautiful to behold, but they are also a harbinger of celebratory times ahead. Here are 15 of my favorite fall trees with the best leaves.\nAmerican Beech The leaves are simple, heavily veined, and slightly toothy. common name American Beech botanical name Fagus grandifolia sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 50’-80’ hardiness zones 3-9 American beech is a slow grower with smooth, gray bark and a full, dense canopy . The leaves are simple, heavily veined, and slightly toothy. In spring and summer, they are a gorgeous blue-green shade. When autumn starts to creep in, those leaves change to brilliant bronze and gold.\nThese trees need at least partial exposure and grow quite large over time. They need moist, well-drained soil that is slightly acidic and rich in nutrients. After the first few years, they need little pruning or maintenance and provide a lot of interest in the landscape.\nBlack Tupelo In addition to its fall leaves, it has interesting, scaly bark that adds interest in winter. common name Black Tupelo botanical name Nyssa sylvatica sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 30’-70’ hardiness zones 4-9 Famed for the honey produced from its nectar , the Black Tupelo is an easy-going tree with reliably wonderful autumn colors. Its flowers are inconspicuous but are a great food source for bees. In addition to its fall leaves, it has interesting, scaly bark that adds interest in winter.\nThe foliage lights up in shades of red, orange, yellow, and purple , with small bluish-black berries that attract birds. It has an oval growth habit and matures to between 30 ‘and 70’ tall . It’s not picky about exposure or soil as long as it doesn’t have wet feet.\nGinkgo They have beautiful and unique fan-shaped foliage that is a lovely bluish-green in summer. common name Ginkgo botanical name Ginkgo biloba sun requirements Full sun height 25’-80’ hardiness zones 3-9 Ginkgos are amazingly long-lived and fascinating trees. The oldest specimen in the world is more than 3,000 years old ! These truly get better and more beautiful with age. They have beautiful and unique fan-shaped foliage that is a lovely bluish-green in summer. For as lovely as they are throughout the year, ginkgos are a glorious golden spectacle in fall.\nPlant your ginkgo in a place where it gets a lot of light. They are drought tolerant and prefer sandy, well-drained soil . Make sure to loosen up and amend your soil if it is clay-heavy or compacts easily. They can live in Zones 3-9 but thrive best in more of a mid-range. Too much heat will decrease a ginkgo’s drought tolerance .\nServiceberry As the days get shorter, serviceberry’s foliage changes to glowing red, gold, and orange embers. common name Serviceberry botanical name Amelanchier arborea sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 15’-30’ hardiness zones 3-9 Serviceberry is a member of the rose family and a more compact tree. At a mature height of 15 to 30 feet , it fits well in more modest spaces, and you can plant it closer to the house without fear of root damage.\nFirst, this tree is known for its spectacular spring floral display. When it blooms, it looks like a fluffy white cloud . As the days get shorter, serviceberry’s foliage changes to glowing red, gold, and orange embers . It glows in any garden space.\nIn its first year, remember to keep the soil moist . Giving your serviceberry a layer of mulch around the base will help retain moisture in the soil. Trees that get more moisture produce more and better-quality, edible berries .\nSugar Maple Its attractive rounded crown makes it an ideal shade tree, and the vermilion, orange, and yellow foliage stands out in fall. common name Sugar Maple botanical name Acer saccharum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 40’-120’ hardiness zones 3-8 You’ll find sugar maple on any list of this kind. It’s simply one of the most flamboyant and reliable sources of autumn foliage around. Its attractive rounded crown makes it an ideal shade tree, and the vermilion, orange, and yellow foliage stands out in fall.\nMaple trees are generally well-loved for this reason. Sugar maple has the highest concentration of sugar of any species , which adds a lot of red tones. Sugar maples like well-drained, acidic soil , but they prefer it not to be too wet or dry. Give your sugar maple space from footpaths or driveways. Their roots are a bit sensitive .\nSassafrass In autumn, they change to shades of orange, yellow, and red, sometimes even a deep burgundy. common name Sassafrass botanical name Sassafras albidum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 30’-80’ hardiness zones 4-9 Sassafrass is a North American native with a rich history of use among Indigenous people. Female trees produce pretty yellow flowers in the spring, and the resulting berries feed birds and other wildlife. The plant also plays host to the spicebush swallowtail butterfly .\nThe foliage is an interesting part of sassafras. The leaves aren’t all the same shape —some are ovoid—but the ends of branches hold interesting, tri-lobed leaves. When young, they have a citrus aroma . In autumn, they change to shades of orange, yellow, and red, sometimes even a deep burgundy.\nEastern Redbud The heart-shaped leaves change from bright green to various warm colors, and the ‘Heart of Gold’ cultivar turns bright yellow. common name Eastern Redbud botanical name Cercis canadensis sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-30’ hardiness zones 4-9 This member of the legume family is a double threat, with stunning spring flowers and incredible autumn foliage. It’s a compact tree with peeling bark that also provides winter interest. The heart-shaped leaves change from bright green to various warm colors, and the ‘Heart of Gold’ cultivar turns bright yellow.\nFull sun exposure will make Eastern redbud produce the most flowers. The rounded crown is a product of many horizontally tiered branches. Moist, well-drained soil is ideal, and it needs a winter chill to set buds.\nOhio Buckeye The fall color can span the spectrum from red to gold, with orange being the most common. common name Ohio Buckeye botanical name Aesculus glabra sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20’-40’ hardiness zones 3-7 Ohio buckeye is another mid-sized tree that blends well in most landscapes. It has a broad crown that is often slightly pointed on top. This is a bloomer, but the flowers are not highly visible among the leaves. They are, however, attractive to pollinators. The resulting fruit is poisonous .\nThe fall color can span the spectrum from red to gold , with orange being the most common. Ohio buckeye makes a lovely shade tree. It prefers well-drained soil and is otherwise unfussy about composition and pH. It likes moderate moisture.\nJapanese Stewartia Before it loses its leaves, they turn bright red and orange. common name Japanese Stewartia botanical name Stewartia pseudocamellia sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 12’-40’ hardiness zones 5-8 It’s sad that I live in Zone 9, just out of range of this wonderful tree. It is often called deciduous camellia because of their physical similarities.

After the leaves fall, the brilliant coral bark adds beauty to the colder months.\nCoral bark maple is a slow grower and small at maturity , making it versatile. It likes rich, moist, acidic soil and is otherwise easy to grow. Just be sure to keep the soil moist, as this tree can dry out easily, leading to leaf scorch.\nFullmoon Maple Rather than the typical maple shape, the leaves on this species are circular with toothy, pointed edges. common name Fullmoon Maple botanical name Acer japonicum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 15’-30’ hardiness zones 5-7 Fullmoon maple is a delicate and beautiful specimen tree with uniquely beautiful foliage. Rather than the typical maple shape , the leaves on this species are circular with toothy, pointed edges .

Lopping your tree off at the top can shorten its lifespan.\nQuaking Aspen This is a distinctive tree with incredible, gleaming, golden autumn leaves. common name Quaking Aspen botanical name Populous tremuloides sun requirements Full sun height 40’-50’ hardiness zones 1-6 If you have a significant space to fill and you want a fast grower , consider a quaking aspen.
