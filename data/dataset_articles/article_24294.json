  "text": "Contents\nYou must work in the fall if you want a yard full of tulips and daffodils in spring. Fortunately, the weather in October is cool and comfortable and perfect for spending a day or a weekend outdoors to plant those bulbs in the ground.\nMany of the bulbs that sprout in spring require a cold period to do so. But that’s only one reason to plant them now. If you miss the window, you can cold-stratify indoors, but your bulbs will miss out on valuable root development.\nPlanting in the fall means that your bulbs will already have some root establishment in the spring. This means they can focus energy on the best and biggest blooms they can produce. Here are some gorgeous blooming bulbs that you can plant in October for an enviable springtime garden.\nTulip ‘Artist’ This compact flower showcases bold orange petals with green streaks. botanical name Tulipa ‘Artist’ sun requirements Full sun height 12” hardiness zones 3-8 Tulips are always a winner when it comes to spring-blooming bulbs. ‘Artist’ is literally an award winner, taking home the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. It’s easy to see why. This classic, single-petal bloom is a Viridiaflora variety.\n‘Artist’ has bold orange petals with green streaks radiating from the heart toward pointed ends. The green in the petals matches the blue-green leaves and ties things together marvelously. This is a compact tulip that makes an excellent border.\nMuscari ‘Fantasy Creation’ This variety features intricate blue-violet double flowers with texture. botanical name Muscari armeniacum ‘Fantasy Creation’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 6”-8” hardiness zones 3-9 ‘Fantasy Creation’ is not what you might expect from a muscari or grape hyacinth. Typically, these plants have small, smooth, rounded flowers in grape-like clusters. This variety has a more textural appearance.\nThis muscari has double flowers, which alters its appearance significantly. Tiny, intricate blue-violet blossoms have a pompom texture. They open from lime green buds and bloom for a long period. They rarely set seed but will naturalize easily.\nDaffodil ‘Pink Charm’ Delicate snow-white petals surround a warm peachy center in this variety. botanical name Narcissus large-cupped ‘Pink Charm’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 1’-2’ hardiness zones 3-8 The American Daffodil Society agrees with me on this wonderful variety. ‘Pink Charm’ earned their Wister Award for being the most innovative daffodil of the year. Slender and delicate, these pretty blooms rise above shorter plants at about 18 inches.\nThe blooms are stunning in their simplicity. Six perfectly shaped snow-white petals surround a peachy-pink cup. A small, prominent cluster of stamens boosts the center’s warm golden glow.\nAllium ‘Ambassador’ This towering cultivar features large globes of star-shaped flowers. botanical name Allium ‘Ambassador’ sun requirements Full sun height Up to 4’ hardiness zones 4-8 While we are on the topic of award winners, this allium is a winner of the RHS Award of Garden Merit. This prestigious recognition is given to only the best and most beautiful plants. Alliums are members of the garlic family and are easy to cultivate and drought-tolerant.\n‘Ambassador’ is a massive cultivar, towering up to four feet tall. Large globes made up of hundreds of star-shaped, purple flowers adorn the top of tall stems. The flower heads are fantastical and long-lasting, blooming into the early summer.\nDutch Iris ‘Blue Diamond’ With a delightful scent, this easy-care flower attracts bees. botanical name Iris x hollandica ‘Blue Diamond’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 20”-24” hardiness zones 5-9 Dutch irises appear so delicate and birdlike. In reality, they are low-maintenance and easy-to-grow additions to the spring garden. Just give them properly draining soil and, in warm climates, a bit of shelter from afternoon exposure. This will extend the life of their flowers.\n‘Blue Diamond’ is the most wonderful shade of pale indigo with brilliant yellow accents. Expect to see plenty of native and honey bees visiting these pretty blooms. They have a soft, sweet scent and make incredible cut flowers. Plant in October to get these bulbs established for years to come.\nCrocus ‘Blue Pearl’ This luminous variety naturalizes beautifully, enhancing spring gardens. botanical name Crocus biflorus ‘Blue Pearl’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3” hardiness zones 3-8 Crocuses are great naturalizers. Once they are in the garden, don’t be surprised to see them popping up here and there in the coming years. They are great little bulbs to sow throughout your lawn as they will pop up and flower before you need to mow.\n‘Blue Pearl’ is a luminous variety with pale blue and white blooms. The shade is nearly opalescent. Before they open, the blue appears as vertical stripes on white buds, slowly lightening as they open. Mix these with a purple or pure white ‘Jeanne d’Arc’ for a simply stunning effect.\nSpring Snowflakes These delicate blooms bring charm and elegance to gardens. botanical name Leucojum vernum sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 8”-10” hardiness zones 3-9 Named for their delicate appearance and early blooming habit, spring snowflakes are similar in appearance to snowdrops. Rather than pure white, rounded flowers, this plant’s blooms are also down-turned but bell-shaped, with small green spots at the tips of its petals.\nThe RHS agrees that this is a fine specimen and awarded it the Award of Garden Merit. If you see a pattern here, there is one! I’m only giving you the very best on this list. Mix your snowdrops and snowflakes together for a charmingly subtle shift in appearance.\nHyacinth ‘Apricot Passion’ This captivating variety brings both beauty and fragrance to gardens. botanical name Hyacinthus orientalis ‘Apricot Passion’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 8”-12” hardiness zones 4-8 If the scent of hyacinth isn’t enough to make you plant these bulbs, the beauty of this cultivar certainly will be. ‘Apricot Passion’ is enchanting in the palest shade of apricot blush around. You must add this to your beds if you’re a cutting gardener.\nHyacinths are easy to grow and have some of the strongest-smelling blooms of spring—or any season, for that matter. Add these blushing beauties to any spot. The soft shade goes with everything.\nGlory of the Snow ‘Luciliae’ Early spring brings delightful star-shaped flowers to gardens. botanical name Chionodoxa luciliae sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3”-6” hardiness zones 3-8 If you plant their bulbs in October, Glory of the Snow pops up alongside crocus and snowdrops as one of the earliest spring bloomers. Adorable star-shaped flowers spring up amongst grassy foliage, which sometimes pops up before the snow entirely disappears.\nThese sweet plants have retreated underground by late spring, waiting for the next year. This species has blue-violet blooms with a white star in the center. It’s named for the wife of Swiss botanist P. Edward Boissier who honored his beloved with this gesture.\nAnemone ‘Blue Shades’ Charming denim blue flowers add beauty to shaded gardens. botanical name Anemone blanda ‘Blue Shades’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 3”-6” hardiness zones 5-8 Sweet, little anemones are commonly overlooked when folks mention spring bulbs. They are a smaller species than those we typically see in floral arrangements. They rarely grow taller than eight inches. Also known as the Grecian windflower, they are charming and subtle members of the spring garden.\n‘Blue Shades’ blooms in denim blue with daisy-like flowers with yellow centers. It is ideal for a woodland border or semi-shade garden spot. It prefers moist soil that is rich in organic material.\nSnowdrop ‘Hippolyta’ This unique variety features ruffled green and white petals. botanical name Galanthus nivalis ‘Hippolyta’ sun requirements Partial to full shade height 5”-8” hardiness zones 3-9 For those shadier spots in the garden, consider planting snowdrop bulbs in October to bring a lovely woodland feel in spring. As sweet as can be, these little lovelies pop up before the snow melts to be one the earliest bloomers of the year.\n‘Hippolyta’ is a marvel. If you love the classic, this might overwhelm you, but if you love an update, this is the one! Between the typical three pure white petals lies a cluster of tiny, green, ruffled petaloids with touches of yellow here and there. This isn’t your average snowdrop.\nEnglish Bluebells Delicate blue blooms create a fragrant springtime delight. botanical name Hyacinthoides non-scripta sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 1’-2’ hardiness zones 5-8 Sweet-smelling English bluebells are a perfumer’s dream. This vigorous grower naturalizes easily to form a beautiful colony of fragrance and beauty. Slender, gently weeping stems support nearly a dozen tiny, bell-shaped blooms above grasslike foliage.\nPlant these bulbs in partial or full shade areas for best results. They pair perfectly with snowdrops. Enjoy the sweet perfume and delicate blue blooms in early spring.\nHimalayan Foxtail Lily Tall spires of white blooms add elegant garden drama. botanical name Eremurus himalaicus sun requirements Full sun height 4’-6’ hardiness zones 5-8 If you’re looking to add some drama to your flower beds, foxtail lilies are just the thing! Tall and slender, these towering beauties know how to attract attention. At heights of up to six feet tall, these look great mixed into the mid-ground of your beds.\nThe Himalayan foxtail lily has tall spires of snowy white blossoms. It coordinates with any color scheme and looks wonderfully classy and chic in any spring garden. Plant these bulbs in October to ensure sufficient root development and cold exposure.\nRanunculus Telecote ‘Salmon’ Multi-tonal blooms create stunning arrangements in warmer gardens. botanical name Ranunculus asiaticus Tecolote ‘Salmon’ sun requirements Full sun to partial shade height 18”-24” hardiness zones 8-10 It’s important to note that ranunculus is not especially cold-tolerant. This one is only for gardeners in Zones 8-10. North of these zones, plant your corms in the spring. In warm climates, put them in the ground as soon as possible for the longest blooming season.\nTecolote ‘Salmon’ is a stunning variety with multi-tonal blooms. Layers upon layers of delicate petals make these an amazing addition to cut arrangements. In cold climates, grow them annually and store bulbs between summer and spring.\nAsiatic Lily ‘Elodie’ This pollen-free lily offers stunning blooms for cutting gardens. botanical name Lilium ‘Elodie’ sun requirements Full sun height 6″-12″ hardiness zones 3-8 This wonderful Asiatic lily isn’t just stunning—it’s pollen-free! Its large, soft pink, double-petaled blooms make it a magnificent plant for the cutting garden. The flowers are a long-lasting florist’s dream.\nAlthough they bloom closer to the end of spring, this bulb is best planted in the fall around October. I can’t think of a single reason not to run out and buy these right now! Happy planting!",
