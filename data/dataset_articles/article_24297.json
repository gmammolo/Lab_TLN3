  "text": "The burn ban that was issued in early July in the City of Portland has been lifted by the Fire Marshal effective immediately. Although the burn ban is being lifted, Portland Fire & Rescue would like to remind folks to only burn dried cordwood in a controlled setting by using a fire ring or elevated fire pit with an active hose line stretched to the location of your fire. Keep all flame lengths less than 24” and be certain to be a safe distance away from any structure and significant vegetation. In addition to the safety concerns with recreational fire pits, PF&R would like you to remain vigilant in your outdoor cooking activities as well. Residents are reminded to use extreme caution when using an outdoor cooking set up with open flame. When using charcoal briquettes, please properly dispose of the ashes in a covered metal container away from combustibles, and keep the ashes wet for a few days before properly disposing of them. Maintain at least ten feet between outdoor cooking and anything combustible such as siding, fences, shrubbery, etc. Ensure all cigarettes/cigars are extinguished prior to disposal. Those living in rural areas are asked to continue to maintain their defensible space by monitoring growth surrounding homes and structures as there is still a wildfire risk posed in our region, and to maintain adequate access for firefighting equipment in the event there is a response need. Contact Portland Fire & Rescue 503-823-3700 for additional information.",
