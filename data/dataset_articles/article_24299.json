  "text": "A Week of Collaboration for MassTimber@MSU at Climate Week NYC \"Timber Tuesday” trio of events draws hundreds at Climate Week NYC. We are proud to have collaborated with our partners to put mass timber on the agenda at NYC Climate Week. On [Timber Tuesday](/masstimber/Events-and-Trainings/timber-tuesday-at-nyc-climate-week) (September 24), MassTimber@MSU and [Colorado Mass Timber Coalition](http://www.comasstimber.org) co-hosted the panel Timber Matters: Regional Approaches to Sustainable Mass Timber Ecosystems. Sponsored by the [National Forest Foundation](https://www.nationalforests.org), the event highlighted efforts to advance mass timber as a sustainable building solution across the United States. Moderated by Lindsey Wikstrom, panelists Marcus Kauffman (Oregon), Sandra Lupien (Michigan/Great Lakes), Gizem Karagoz (New York), Will Lepry (Colorado), and Catherine Pfeiffenberger (Georgia) shared insights into how their regions are building momentum around mass timber. In addition to co-hosting this event, Sandra was a featured speaker on the Building with Wood: Nature’s Climate Solution panel, hosted by the [American Wood Council](https://awc.org/) and [WoodWorks](https://www.woodworks.org/). Led by moderator [Sophie Morin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophie-morin-8066a6167) of AWC, panelists [Kathryn Fernholz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryn-fernholz-948405b) of [Dovetail Partners, Inc.,](https://www.dovetailinc.org/) [Alexis Feitel, P.E.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfeitel/) of [KL&A Engineers and Builders](https://www.klaa.com/), and Sandra covered the full sustainability spectrum of the mass timber value chain—from forestry and manufacturing to building design and policy—highlighting wood buildings as a crucial solution to today’s climate challenges. Sandra also attended several other events during the week. She joined Saint-Gobain’s Sustainable Construction Talk on September 23, exploring how the built environment can adapt to climate challenges. On September 25, she participated in Cambium Carbon’s Decarbonization by Design Luncheon and Panel and joined a special presentation by mass timber architect Susan Jones at the Harvard Club. She also attended the NAFO/IFSC Reception, connecting with industry experts on sustainable forestry. On September 26, Sandra took part in the Decarbonizing Buildings: A Whole Lifecycle Approach panel at the Center for Architecture, before attending the invite-only Buyer-Supplier Partnership Networking Event hosted by [Weyerhaeuser](https://www.weyerhaeuser.com/) and [Carbon Direct](https://www.carbon-direct.com/). Wrapping up the week, she visited the [High Line Moynihan Connector](https://www.som.com/projects/high-line-moynihan-connector/)—a 600-foot-long timber bridge in Midtown West. Through these panels and events, we connected with current partners and fostered new collaborations, while bringing Michigan’s mass timber momentum to an international stage. We look forward to expanding on these conversations!",
