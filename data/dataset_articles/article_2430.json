  "text": "None found suitable for promotion as district judge in Rajasthan: Not 1st instance\nThe Rajasthan High Court notified that the result of the written examination for promotion in the cadre of district judge by way of limited competitive examination, 2024, was declared as \"none found suitable\".\nIn Short\n- Rajasthan High Court found no candidate eligible for district judge promotion\n- Competitive exam for district judge post held on March 8 and 9\n- Similar instances have occurred in Telangana, Gujarat, Odisha\nThe Rajasthan High Court has announced that none of the candidates who appeared for the limited competitive examination for promotion to the district judge cadre in 2024 have been found suitable. The written test was held on March 8 and 9.\nThe High Court on Tuesday notified that the result of the written examination for promotion in the cadre of district judge by way of limited competitive examination, 2024, was declared as \"none found suitable\".\nThis is, however, not the first such case. Instances like these underscore the rigorous standards and challenges associated with the appointment of judges.\nIn several states, the recruitment process for district judges faced challenges related to the suitability of candidates.\nIn February 2025, none of the 366 candidates in Odisha who appeared for the written examination for 45 district judge positions qualified for the interview round.\nThese candidates who took the test included advocates and judicial officers and none of the candidates who took the test qualified.\nAs per the registrar's notices, none qualified in the written examination for direct recruitment to the posts in the cadre of district judge from among the advocates and judicial officers.\nIn November 2024, the Telangana High Court declared that no candidates were selected for the district judge (entry level) positions in the Telangana State Judicial Service.\nIn a notification issued by the registrar recruitment, it was stated that no candidate has been selected to the post of district judge (entry level) notified for 2024 in the Telangana State Judicial Service under direct recruitment and the vacancies notified will be carried forward to the next year.\nThe result was for the appointment to nine posts of district judge (entry level) by direct recruitment.\nIn 2019, the Madras High Court conducted the preliminary examination for direct recruitment of district judges in Tamil Nadu. However, out of over 3,500 applicants, no one had qualified.\nThis was after applications were called for from practicing advocates, assistant public prosecutors and so on.\nIn 2022, the Gujarat High Court declared the result of the recruitment process for district judges post as 'nil'. The process was conducted for the appointment of 34 posts of district judge.\nNone of the applicants, including lawyers and judicial officers, qualified for the post of district judges. This wasn't the first time. Even in 2019, none of the advocates who appeared could clear the recruitment process.\nEven the Jammu and Kashmir Judicial Service has seen more than one such instance.\nIn 2022, over 200 candidates appeared for recruitment to the posts of district judges, but nobody qualified. The process was conducted for filling up seven posts of district judges, but none of the applicants qualified for the direct recruitment examination.",
