  "text": "ATLANTA — Georgia's drought was erased in just one week. In the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, released early Thursday morning, not a single area in the state is still in a drought.\nLast week, nearly 37% of the state was in drought, including 13% in a Level 2 'Severe' Drought and 0.97% in a Level 3 'Extreme' drought.\nWhy? Our record rainfall. Atlanta received the highest 48-hour rainfall on record, according to the State of Georgia Climatologist. 11.12 inches of rain soaked the area, beating out the previous record of 9.59 inches in 48 hours, which had been in place since 1886.\nHelene was preceded by a separate tropical heavy rain event on Wednesday, September 25th. Then, the devastating Hurricane made landfall, sending more flooding rains into north Georgia and metro Atlanta.\nWidespread 6 to 14 inch rain totals were observed. Here are some of the top rainfall reports from the state, according to the National Weather Service in Peachtree City:\n- McDonough - 13.89\"\n- Brasstown - 13.18\"\n- East Point - 12.71\"\n- Stone Mountain - 12.52\"\n- North Decatur - 12.51\"\n- Irondale - 12.44\"\n- Dunwoody - 12.17\"\n- Tucker - 11.65\"",
