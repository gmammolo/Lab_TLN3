(WDBJ) - WDBJ7 saw a big response to the organization of a [water donation drive](https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/10/01/wdbj7-collecting-water-donations-help-flood-victims/) to help supply local areas hit hardest by Helene’s remnants. “We were told what people needed most and got to action,” said News Director Brent BonFleur. “This is the least we could do, to give our hometowns clean drinking water.” Three-thousand cases of water were donated. “That’s 50 tons of water to help our communities suffering from devastating damage,” said Creative Services Director Chrissy Funk. Vice President and Regional General Manager Matt Pumo said, “It’s amazing how our hometowns responded to this crisis. It proves what a great place we live in and shows how united we are.” WDBJ7 delivered 12 tons of water to Galax. The remaining water was hauled out by The Virginia Department of Emergency Management, Salvation Army, Virginia Tech, and others. The water will be dispersed among our hometowns most in need.
