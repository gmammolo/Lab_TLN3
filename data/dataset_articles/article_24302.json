The new Boyne Valley Bru na Boinne National Park in [Co Meath](https://www.irishstar.com/all-about/co-meath) will become the seventh of its kind in Ireland, joining an exclusive club that includes only one other park in the east, the Wicklow Mountains National Park.

Bru na Boinne earned its place on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993, celebrated alongside the ancient passage tombs of Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth. Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O'Brien TD, expressed the importance of this event: \"Rarely does the State get an opportunity to acquire lands of such significance. This landscape and property is of exceptional heritage importance. Here in this one place we have over 5,000 years of recorded history.\", reports [the Irish Star](https://www.irishstar.com/news/ireland-news/ireland-getting-new-national-park-31074341). He further committed to the site's future, stating: \"In our care, it will significantly enhance our management of the Bru na Boinne World Heritage landscape. We will conserve and protect Dowth's heritage in line with our obligations to UNESCO and we will enhance responsible tourism, ensuring it becomes a standout destination.\" [Revamp of pretty Irish town to make it more attractive for tourists](https://www.irishstar.com/travel/ireland/revamp-pretty-irish-town-sligo-32897076) \"This purchase opens up possibilities for us to develop heritage partnerships, protect remarkable heritage and make it accessible.

Numerous mammals like foxes, badgers, hares, rabbits, shrews, and red deer also find safe haven within its bounds.
