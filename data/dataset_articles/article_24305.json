  "text": "RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - The Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California is hosting its first Washoe Intentional Fire Training in Lake Tahoe. “We are closely connected to this earth. We’ll be able to help them recognize the different medicine, food sources, plants, and animals that need to be protected,” said Buck Cruz, the Washoe Tribe project manager. An opportunity to promote cultural burning, land stewardship and forest maintenance. Fire crews receive hands-on training in operating a fire engine, deploying a fire hose, and pumping water. “These are really important if you’re in a scenario where you can’t get an engine out. It’s nice to be able to put that little draft hose into a body of water and use that to supply water,” said Brandon Cobb with The Nature Conservancy. Along with career-building. “All of this is possible for them. Anybody can come out here and join wildland fire and start that connection. All it is is them taking that step. There are plenty of regular people that join and having those natives build that connection between that forest service and the native tribe is something that is important,” added Campbell. The project manager for the Washoe Tribe’s Conservation Corps, Buck Cruz, says this provides avenues for their native knowledge not to be forgotten. “Our medicine people, they prayed over these fires. A lot of these people here now today, pray to this fire. They recognize it as a living entity and living forest.” Copyright 2024 KOLO. All rights reserved.",
