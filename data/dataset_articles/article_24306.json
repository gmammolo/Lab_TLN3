  "text": "Jaidyn Kennedy\nMelbourne Water has opened its Liveable Communities Liveable Waterways (LCLW) grant program to the Port Phillip and Westernport region, which includes the Maribyrnong and Werribee catchments.\nWith many rural headwater streams and creeks situated on private property, Melbourne Water emphasised that landholders play a crucial role protecting the health of these waterways.\nBy replanting vegetation, controlling weeds, and putting in fencing to exclude livestock, streamside landholders make important contributions to preserving the ecological balance.of waterways.\nMelbourne Water says works to protect headwater streams and small rural creeks support the ecology of the waterways by protecting the water bugs that feed the smaller fish and support bigger fish further downstream.\nWorks to restore native vegetation also supports habitat and food for native animals and improves the stability of waterway embankments.\nMelbourne Water service partnerships manager Trent Griffiths stressed the necessity of stewardship around the Maribyrnong River.\n“These are areas where there are a lot of streams and creeks on private property that are really important to the health of the Maribyrnong catchment overall.”\nMelbourne Water says LCLW is a vital part of how communities can contribute to the Healthy Waterways Strategy, a 50-year vision for the health of waterways in the five major catchments across Port Phillip and Westernport region.\nInformation: www.melbournewater.com.au/services/grants/liveable-communities-liveable-waterways-program",
