  "text": "Thanks to Governor Maura Healey’s intervention, Nibi the Beaver has a forever home at the Newhouse Wildlife Rescue in Chelmsford, and a new role as an educational mascot.\nNibi has been in the spotlight since state wildlife officials ordered the beaver released into the wild, and Jane Newhouse, founder of the rescue, resisted, saying that would put the animal’s life at significant risk as winter nears.\nNibi’s plight has generated thousands of supporters, an online petition, court hearings, and a restraining order to prevent the animal’s release.\n“Nibi has captured the hearts of many of our residents, mine included,” Healey said in the statement. “We’re excited to share that we have issued a permit for Nibi to remain in Newhouse’s care, continuing to educate the public about this important species.”\nAdvertisement\nHealey said she was grateful to the state’s “dedicated wildlife biologists” who devote themselves to Massachusetts wildlife and hopes “Nibi inspires more people to protect our natural world.”\nNibi has lived at the center since she was a newborn beaver found abandoned by the side of the road in Sturbridge two years ago.\nMassWildlife officials notified Newhouse in June about Nibi’s imminent return to the wild. WCVB reported that state officials had planned to release Nibi on Tuesday.\nAttorneys representing the wildlife rescue filed a lawsuit to prevent Nibi’s immediate release. A hearing was set for Tuesday afternoon in Middlesex Superior Court in Lowell, but the two sides agreed to postpone it until Friday, court records show.\nThen, the Governor stepped in with the special permit.\nThe ultimate goal of wildlife rehabilitation centers is to care for sick, injured, or orphaned animals so that they can be released back into the wild, Healey’s statement said.\nIn rare cases, a permit can be issued for the animal to be used in educational settings, the statement said.\n“We all care about what is best for the beaver known as Nibi and all wild animals throughout our state,” Mark Tisa, director of MassWildlife, said in the statement. “Our mission is to protect and conserve the diverse species of fish and wildlife throughout Massachusetts. We share the public’s passion for wildlife and invite everyone to learn more about beavers and their important place in our environment.”\nAdvertisement",
