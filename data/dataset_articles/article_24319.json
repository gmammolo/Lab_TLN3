  "text": "Zug, Switzerland, October 1st, 2024, Chainwire\nEnergy Web’s innovative app enables EV owners to decarbonize charging sessions with renewable energy\nEnergy Web is proud to announce the beta launch of AutoGreenCharge, a mobile app designed to decarbonize electric vehicle (EV) charging. With AutoGreenCharge, users can ensure that every EV charging session is powered by renewable energy. The app is accessible to owners of popular electric vehicles, including Tesla, BMW, Mercedes, and others, bringing the promise of green charging to a worldwide, mainstream audience.\nPowered by the decentralized technology of Energy Web’s EnergywebX and secured by the Polkadot blockchain, AutoGreenCharge offers a simple, secure, and verifiable solution to ensure EV charging is not just electric, but 100% renewable. By integrating renewable energy certificates (RECs), the app will automatically match EV charging sessions with clean energy, providing verifiable green charging in real time. While in the beta phase, users can familiarize themselves with the app’s core features and experience the future of EV charging firsthand.\nAutoGreenCharge allows EV owners to easily connect their vehicles through a partnership with Smart Car. Once connected, every charging session is automatically tracked, giving users detailed insights into their energy consumption and environmental impact. As the app evolves toward full production, users will be able to retire real renewable energy certificates with each charging session, ensuring their cars are powered by clean, sustainable energy sources. Additionally, they will have the option to specify preferences for the type and location of renewable energy, offering personalized access to solar, wind, and other clean energy sources from around the globe.\nMani Hagh Sefat, CTO of Energy Web, shared, “AutoGreenCharge represents a major step forward in the electrification and decarbonization of transportation. By providing EV owners with a seamless way to ensure their cars are charged with renewable energy, we’re empowering drivers to make more sustainable choices and actively contribute to the global energy transition.”\nAutoGreenCharge’s integration with the Polkadot blockchain ensures that every transaction and certificate retirement is securely recorded and verifiable, enhancing transparency and trust in the system. This cutting-edge app is a key development in the broader mission to build a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy system.\nWith the beta version now available, EV owners are encouraged to download the AutoGreenCharge app and start participating in this transformative initiative. The app can be easily found on the testflight Apple and Google Play Stores. As the app moves towards its full production release, users will play a crucial role in refining its features and improving the future of green charging.\nFor more information, users can visit Energyweb.org\nAbout Energy Web\nEnergy Web is driving the global energy transition through cutting-edge, open-source, decentralized software solutions. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create new market mechanisms and decentralized applications that empower energy companies, grid operators, and consumers to actively shape their energy futures. Our mission is to build a more resilient, efficient, and sustainable energy system for all.\nContact Jonathan\njonathan@distractive.xyz",
