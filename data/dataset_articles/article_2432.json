  "text": "Tinder Plot? New Jersey woman offered $12k to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter\nJaclyn Diiorio, 26, is accused of offering $12,000 to a Tinder match to kill her ex-boyfriend, a Philadelphia police officer, and his daughter. She was arrested and faces a detention hearing.\nIn Short\n- NJ woman accused of murder-for-hire plot\n- Diiorio offered $12,000 to kill ex and his daughter\n- Used Tinder alias 'D' to contact informant\nA New Jersey woman is accused of attempting to hire a man she met on the dating app Tinder to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter. The Camden County Prosecutor’s Office issued a press release announcing the arrest of 26-year-old Jaclyn Diiorio.\nAccording to court documents, Diiorio allegedly offered $12,000 to an informant she met on Tinder to kill her ex-boyfriend — a Philadelphia police officer in his 50s — and his 19-year-old daughter.\nUsing the alias “D” on the app, Diiorio first met the informant on March 31 in Runnemede, New Jersey. In the days that followed, they exchanged texts and phone calls. During these communications, she reportedly revealed her intent to have her ex-boyfriend killed.\nOn April 3, the Major Crimes Unit was alerted to the murder-for-hire plot. The Philadelphia police officer later confirmed that Diiorio was his ex-girlfriend and had previously been his barber. The relationship ended on March 6, 2025.\nOn April 4, Diiorio met the informant again on the 1300 block of North Black Horse Pike in Gloucester Township. She handed him $500 in cash as an initial payment. The rest of the money was to be paid in installments. Shortly after, Diiorio was arrested by Gloucester Township Police.\nShe is currently being held at the Camden County Correctional Facility and is scheduled for a detention hearing on April 9 in Superior Court.",
