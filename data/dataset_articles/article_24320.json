  "text": "New Delhi, Oct 3: The Baansera Park on the banks of Yamuna river will soon harvest its first crop of ‘Lakadong turmeric’, a rare variety brought in from Meghalaya and it available to people of the national capital, according to official sources here today.\nLakadong turmeric is a rare and prized variety of turmeric that is native to the Jaintia Hills region of Meghalaya. It is known for its high curcumin content, which gives it a bright yellow colour and a distinct aroma and earthy flavour.\nAn official said that on the direction of Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had implemented a pilot project for planting turmeric on the banks of Yumuna at Baansera four months back, which exhibited an 80% success rate. Now, a decision has been taken to replicate the plantation at its other green spaces too.\nThe trial cultivation of Lakadong turmeric was in line with DDA’s persistent innovative approach aimed at adding diversity to its flora. Earlier, there were plantations of chandan, chinar, cherry blossom, water apple, green apple and grapes with success, the sources said.\nThe DDA had planted the turmeric under the thick bamboo groves over two acres of land at Baansera, a sustainability-themed bamboo park, that has shown good growth. The DDA procured the turmeric seeds from Meghalaya and cultivated it at Baansera under the bamboo groves that are considered conducive for the survival and growth of this turmeric.\nConsidered to be one of the best varieties of turmeric worldwide, it is highly valued and most sought-after in the medicinal and wellness sectors. Additionally, its volatile oil content, ranging from 3.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent, increases its appeal across various industries, they said.\nLakadong a tiny, nondescript village at the foothills of West Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya, where the world’s finest variety of turmeric grows. It is most favoured for its high curcumin content of more than 7%, as against 2 to 3% found in regular varieties available in the market.\nOnly recently, the Meghalaya Collectives, an initiative of the Meghalaya government, showcased 20 exclusive brands and value added products made from renowned Lakadong Turmeric, Khasi Mandarin, Kew Pineapple, local ginger, cashew nuts, and many other indigenous produce, during the ‘World Food India 2024’ event held in the national capital.\nDuring the event, farmer-producer organisations, rural entrepreneurship, and sustainable agriculture practices were also promoted.\nThis approach was aimed to enhance farmers’ income, improve agricultural productivity, and promote Meghalaya’s organic products.",
