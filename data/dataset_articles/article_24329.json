  "text": "Compassionate thoughts and proper action are moving towards those who have lost homes in recent flooding, but while some dreams have tragically been washed away, pockets of hope and goodness keep community moving forward.\nOn Tuesday, one such pocket sprang up on Crescent Street in Morristown as a small group organized by Lakeway Area Habitat for Humanity gathered to break ground on a charming green for a new home for Amanda and Greyson Lerch.\n\"I was reading the section where Solomon reminds us there is a season for everything — a time to plant, a time to harvest, a time to build, a time to tear down,\" Lakeway Habitat board member and Living Promise Lutheran Church Pastor Matt Westra said. \"With all the destruction in our community, certainly we've seen some tearing down, there's been some hard things. But we're also grateful for this season, a chance to build up, a chance for something new.\"\nAmanda is no stranger to Habitat; as a teenager Amanda volunteered her time as a teenager for a home build while living in Colorado.\nNow living in Tennessee some years later as a single mother, she realized that Habitat might make the dream of home ownership a reality.\n\"In 2022, she applied for home ownership,\" Community Outreach Coordinator Leslie Brenna said. \"It turns out she was a great candidate.\n\"Amanda works two jobs and she donates plasma to pay bills and save up so she can have a home. She's also a valuable member of our community; she gives swim lessons to kids and works with kids with special needs.\"\nBrenna described Amanda's excitement to have a home to help invest in her and Greyson's futures.\n\"I am just so excited...\" Amanda started to say.\n\"We are so jazzed!\" Greyson interjected with enthusiasm as those gathered chuckled at the turn of phrase.\n\"Yes,\" Amanda agreed. \"This has been a long time coming. I feel so blessed for all of you who showed up, who've been with me in our walks of life these past couple of years and I'm just really excited to get this next chapter of my life started.\"\nIn addition to financial contributions, Lerch will have to put in, at a minimum and like all Habitat homeowners, 300 work hours of \"sweat equity\" into the build.\n100 hours of labor can be donated by friends and family.\nBrenna said volunteers, materials and money are all needs for the organization.\nLakeway Area Habitat for Humanity has built 63 homes in the area since 1992, and the home on Crescent street is number 64.\nWe have a mission to put God's love into action,\" Brenna said. \"We do this by building and improving homes.\"\nIn addition to the home building, Lakeway Habitat has kept people in their homes by performing hundreds of critical home repairs, particularly for seniors.\nNew Lakeway Habitat Assistant Project Coordinator Dallan Hodge was on hand to help break some ground.\nWestra, Hodge, Amanda and Greyson put their shovels into the ground and lifted earth, turning soil and a new page.",
