  "text": "Most of our area has been removed from the drought MERIDIAN, Miss. (WTOK) - The rain from last week was enough to successfully remove most of our area from the moderate drought and all of our area from the severe drought. Yet, parts of Sumter and Choctaw counties do remain in a drought. There is a chance for showers on Friday, but if the remaining drought stricken areas miss out on that rain... then their drought may get worse due to an upcoming dry stretch. After Friday, rain isn’t expected in our area for the next week. Friday’s showers will be affiliated with a surface trough along with an upper-level trough of low pressure. Not everyone gets rain, but scattered showers are possible.... especially along & south of I-20. Severe weather isn’t expected, but the best timing showers will be during morning. So use caution on wet roads if you encounter rain during your AM Commute. By Friday afternoon, showers will gradually taper-off. So, the weather will be cooperative for the high school football games on Friday evening. Clouds and showers will keep many areas cooler than average with highs struggling to reach 80 degrees. WEEKEND OUTLOOK The weekend brings sun-filled / unseasonably warm weather. No rain is expected, and highs both days will reach the upper 80s. So, make some outdoor plans! FIRST ALERT- A COOL DOWN NEXT WEEK Next week, a cooling trend will take place. A strong cold front will cross our area on Monday. We’ll start the work week with above average highs that flirt with 90 degrees, but it’ll be noticeably cooler in the wake of the cold front for Tuesday. Highs will fall into the low 80s, and mornings will fall into the COMFY 50s! This cooler trend (especially with our AM temps) will follow us to the end of the week.
