  "text": "Port of Newcastle, one of the largest coal ports in the world, has broken its own sustainability record for the fourth consecutive year.\nSince 2021, Port of Newcastle has consistently improved its coveted Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) score and maintained its five-star GRESB rating.\nGRESB is an independent organisation that provides authenticated environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance data for its organisation so it can be compared to its peers.\nThe five-star GRESB rating is reserved for the top 20 per cent of surveyed companies globally, and formally recognises industry leaders in sustainability.\nThis year, the port achieved an overall score of 97 out of 100, a jump from 96 in 2023 , 95 in 2022 and 92 in 2021.\nThe result also included a score of 100 per cent in climate change reporting, scenario analysis, and risk and opportunity identification.\nPort of Newcastle chief executive officer Craig Carmody said the achievement was thanks to a boosted focus on decarbonising operations and increasing engagement with industry and employees.\n“A GRESB score of 97 shows Port of Newcastle’s commitment to continuously improving sustainability, and I’m incredibly proud of the efforts of every member of the PON team,” he said .\n“ESG is embedded as a core principle across our business and our culture, and this is evidenced through this year’s result.”\nCarmody said Port of Newcastle identified several improvement areas in this year’s assessment period, including climate change.\n“It’s a great result to have achieved 100 per cent in climate change reporting and scenario analysis, but we won’t stop striving to improve,” he said.\n“Port of Newcastle is delivering on a significant diversification strategy to create the Port for the future.\n“Central to this is our Clean Energy Precinct , which will position us as a leading production, storage and export hub for future sustainable, clean energy products and technologies, including hydrogen and green ammonia.”\nSubscribe to Australian Mining and receive the latest news on product announcements, industry developments, commodities and more.",
