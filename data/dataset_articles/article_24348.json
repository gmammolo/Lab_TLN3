  "text": "Aggreko has announced the launch of its latest mid-sized battery energy storage systems (BESS).\nDesigned to meet a wide array of on- and off-grid applications, these systems enable reduced emissions and costs while delivering flexibility, reliability, and efficiency.\nThe new 500 kilowatt (kW)/250 kilowatt hour (kWh) BESS units feature a fully integrated plug-and-play design, allowing them to supply power in the most demanding situations.\nThese batteries can operate in island mode, as part of a hybrid solution with a generator, or in parallel with additional BESS units, making them ideal for renewable power applications.\nThe new BESS unit offers numerous benefits. They are environmentally friendly, helping operators meet emissions regulations while their fast installation and commissioning reduce generator run time and fuel consumption, enabling significant cost savings and autonomy.\nSupported by Aggreko’s robust customer service, including remote monitoring, these units ensure enhanced reliability and uninterrupted operation.\nAs part of Aggreko’s Greener Upgrades initiative, the new batteries are now available across the Asia-Pacific region. These solutions are offered under flexible contracts, embodying Aggreko’s hallmark qualities of being modular, scalable, and requiring no capital expenditure (CAPEX).\nThese units enhance the existing battery portfolio and demonstrate Aggreko’s commitment to providing flexible, reliable, and environmentally friendly energy solutions.\nAs key enablers of the energy transition across various industries, these BESS units will help customers reduce emissions and costs while maintaining the highest standards of quality and performance.\nAggreko looks forward to the positive impact these units will have in advancing sustainable energy practices.",
