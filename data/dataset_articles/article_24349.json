  "text": "The Atlas Copco CEA HiLight BI+ 4 hybrid light tower has landed in Australia, and is ideal for local mine sites, where it can light the way to a brighter future.\nA tlas CEA, the distributor of Atlas Copco lighting towers in Australia, has expanded its established range of HiLight temporary lighting solutions with the addition of the BI+ 4.\nThe new HiLight BI+ 4 Hybrid Light Tower builds on the existing range to incorporate lithium-ion batteries and a low-consumption Stage V diesel engine.\nThe result is a hybrid-power lighting solution that offers a reliable source of light that doesn’t cost the Earth.\n“Atlas Copco has a focus on developing a variety of products across their power portfolio for a more sustainable future,” Atlas CEA Atlas Copco brand leader David Buttigieg told Australian Mining .\n“The BI4 was born through a series of battery development projects and an addition to the already proven lighting tower range adding battery technology.”\nThe tower features four operating modes – it can be powered directly from mains electricity, from its lithium-ion batteries, from its diesel engine, or from a hybrid setting to make the most of the energy available.\nThe new hybrid light towers offer battery autonomy of up to six hours when operating at full capacity. And, when using their dimming function, they can provide over 19 hours of silent and emission-free operation with a single charge.\nWith a battery recharging time of just four hours, the HiLight BI+ 4 can also feature an external power plug as an added option.\nButtigieg said operators can be assured of the robustness and quality of the HiLight BI+ 4.\n“Atlas Copco products have long been known for their strength and build quality,” Buttigieg said.\n“The site conditions across Australia can be diverse and demanding. It’s critical our products can withstand these conditions to support our local customer needs.\n“Its what you would expect from Atlas Copco – a proven, efficient, sustainable, reliable and well supported product for now and into the future.”\nThe HiLight BI+ 4 requires a service interval every 1500 hours of lighting, saving operators on costs associated with maintenance and servicing. With a 60 per cent reduction in engine runtime, these service intervals are three times longer than light towers that run solely on diesel.\n“With the capacity to run for an extensive period, the BI+4 ensures worksites stay well-lit with energy-efficient luminosity, night after night,” Buttigieg said.\nNot only is the HiLight built to last, but each tower also has four floodlights providing 150-watt power to reliably cover 4000 square metres at 20 lux.\nThe HiLight BI+ 4 employs surface-mount device LED technology, which Buttigieg said is renowned for its energy efficiency and reliability, and which extends the working day and contributes to a safer working environment.\n“With the ability to light such a large area, the HiLight range is both efficient and practical,” he said. “With safety a high priority for us and our customer base, we are confident the range ensures sites are safe without limiting the opportunity to be as productive as possible.”\nWhile keeping visibility at an optimal level on a mine site is essential, it’s the HiLight BI+ 4’s potential environmental benefits where the tower really shines.\nThanks to its lithium-ion batteries, the light tower reduces reliance on the diesel engine, cutting CO2 emissions by up to seven tonnes per unit per year compared to traditional diesel-powered light towers.\n“Atlas Copco has placed a great deal of focus on creating a range that is efficient and environmentally conscious and delivers a cost-effective solution for its customers,” Buttigieg said.\nThe HiLight BI+ 4 is a versatile lighting solution suited for various applications, including construction sites, events, mining operations, emergency situations and rental services. Its ability to operate on batteries, diesel and hybrid mode provides users with flexibility, catering to diverse operational needs while enhancing sustainability and reducing operational costs.\n“The interest for the BI4 has been really positive and now we have product to demonstrate supporting those opportunities,” Buttigieg said.\n“The landscape is always evolving and Atlas Copco is at the forefront.”\nThis feature appeared in the October 2024 issue of Australian Mining .",
