  "text": "Samoa's vision of a healthier and greener environment was launched on Tuesday evening with the unveiling of 76 electric vehicles that would be used for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\nThe Government of Samoa in partnership with the Government of Japan and the United Nations Development Program also launched their Climate Action Pathways for Island Transport (CAP IT) project.\nIn addition to the launching of 76 electric vehicles, charging stations and two documents on climate action pathways were released as well.\nOne document deals with electric vehicles and the disposal of car batteries while the other highlights the trend in motor vehicle use in Samoa.\nMinister of Works, Transport and Insfrastructure, Olo Fiti Vaai in his keynote address said the electric vehicles have been manufactured and configured to suit Samoa.\n\"The provision of 76 EV's to Samoa represents a monumental achievement in driving our response to the Exepcted Outcomes of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, the Pathway to the Development of Samoa(PDS) 2021 to 2026and the Transport and Infrastructure Sector Plan 2023 - 2028, therefore further emphasising our dedication to Green Developments,\" he said.\n\"On behalf of the Government of Samoa, I express profound gratitude to the Government of Japan for their generous contribution to the \"Promoting Green Transformation in the Pacific Region\" project which spans across four island countries with a total funding of US$37.5 million. Of this, an amount of US$15.5 million has been allocated to Samoa's CAP IT project alone, enabling the initiative that we celebrate today.\"\nOlo believes that this support will reflect their shared commitment to a sustainable future. Their commitment to minimise pollution, reduce waste and lower emissions in the transport sector sustains their responsibility to safeguard land, water, and air for the future generations.\nThe project includes the establishment of charging stations, capacity building, public awareness campaigns and equipped selected automotive workshops for maintenance.\nOlo also confirmed the usage of the EVs during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting for transportation. He acknowledged everyone that was involved in the project and making it become a reality.\n\"We are deeply grateful to the UNDP Multi Country Office for their leadership, and for recognising the importance of country-led initiatives, as well as local ownership in this journey. We also acknowledge local consultant Kolone Vaai and Associates (KVA Consultants) for supporting UNDP in the studies and reports. Lastly but not least, we thank the Ford Hyundai Company, who were the successful contractor in the procurement of EVs.\"\nThe electricity that was used for the event was all from the EVs.",
