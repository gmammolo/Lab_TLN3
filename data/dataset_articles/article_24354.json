  "text": "The First Nations community of Cherbourg will receive $26 million to upgrade its water infrastructure. The local council hopes the upgrade will put an end to frequent \"boil water\" alerts. What's next? The council expects the new water treatment plant to be operational within two to three years. The residents of Cherbourg are finally getting a secure water supply that will make a major difference to their health and lives. Alerts advising residents to boil their water have been a frequent occurrence for the First Nations settlement three hours' drive from Brisbane, known as one of Australia's most disadvantaged communities. The most recent episode extended nine months until July 2024, due to a muddy water supply containing E. coli bacteria, fed directly from a nearby creek. According to a 2022 risk management report, water runoff from nearby cattle grazing land contained a \"significant load\" of viruses and bacteria, with mining operations from a nearby lime quarry also posing a risk to the water supply. Cherbourg Shire Council staff said the 70-year-old water treatment plant should have been upgraded decades ago in order to keep pace with population growth and more intensive agriculture. \"It's probably the last 20 to 25 years that we haven't been making a high enough quality of water to be the standard with the rest of Queensland,\" operations manager Matthew Boch said. 'Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom' Queensland Water Minister Glenn Butcher this week announced $26 million in joint funding from the state and federal governments to fix the problem, including improvements to the water mains, filtration equipment and water treatment processes. Mr Butcher said the funding was locked in and was not dependent on the outcome of October's Queensland election. \"It will certainly give them the best water-drinking quality they can get,\" Mr Butcher said. \"As we know, some of these remote regions need that extra support with extra filtration and extra upgrades for water treatment facilities — that's what this funding is going to do.\" Mr Boch said he expected construction to begin in June 2025, with the new infrastructure operational within two to three years. Cherbourg Shire Council chief executive Chatur Zala said the funding announcement was a welcome outcome after protracted negotiations with the state and federal governments. \"Sometimes we have to hit rock bottom for them to see things are not really working,\" he said. \"We'll do everything to ensure we don't go back to the boil water alerts, because no-one likes them.\" 'Why do we have to wait and wait and wait?' Residents have linked the substandard water supply with Cherbourg's deep health disadvantage. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the community has more than twice the rate of long-term health conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease than the rest of the state. Workers caring for the most vulnerable in the community long ago eschewed the town's water supply, opting instead to buy bottled water. Aunty Jacqui Tapua, who is director of the community-run Gundoo Early Childhood Centre, said the centre paid about $600 per month for bottled water. But she said outbreaks of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and rotaviruses were common for children who drank the town water at home. \"We're not that remote that our water quality [should be] so poor that our children suffer, our elders suffer,\" she said. Aunty Tapua said long delays in bringing the water supply up to standard were a clear example of the inequitable treatment of First Nations communities in Cherbourg. \"If it was a non-Indigenous community, I think the problem would be solved,\" she said. \"Sometimes we feel like, 'Why do we have to wait and wait and wait.'\" Despite being let down by announcements of past initiatives, Aunty Tapua was cautiously optimistic the new funding would result in a water supply that would meet the expectations of all Australians. \"I think we hear too often, 'We're fixing it,'\" she said. \"Hopefully they'll do it right this time, for the future of the children of our community.\" ABC Wide Bay — local news in your inbox ABC Privacy Collection Statement .",
