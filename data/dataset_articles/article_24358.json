  "text": "By Jason Vondersmith ,\n2 hours ago\nOne of Portland's more popular attractions for climbing and off-road bicycling and more reopens to the public on Saturday, Oct. 5.\nPortland Parks & Recreation will be celebrating the reopening of Gateway Green in East Portland, located near the Gateway Transit Center and confluence of Interstate 205 and Interstate 84, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, which happens to be the Take Your Kid Mountain Biking Day, presented by NW Trail Alliance .\nIn partnership with the nonprofit Friends of Gateway Green, PP&R acquired the 25 acres of formerly unused land in 2014 and turned it into a unique off-road cycling and hiking destination. Gateway Green’s soft-surface and paved multi-use trails allow visitors to bike, hike, explore, and connect to the regional trail and cycling network. The Friends of Gateway Green and NW Trail Alliance have been and remain key partners in the park’s success.\nSaturday's fun includes: bike skills challenge stations; loaner mountain bikes; face painting; raffle; ice cream truck (available for purchase); refreshments. PP&R encourages visitors to take public transportation; vehicle parking will be at Fred Meyer parking lot across from Gateway Transit Center.\nThere is a new south entrance that leads directly from the Gateway Transit Center to the new bridge, which flows directly into the PP&R's new entry plaza and expanded mountain biking and trail system. The new bridge is a dedicated pedestrian/bike bridge for park access and is a product of TriMet’s Better Red project that has been using the park for the past three years.\nThe improvements at Gateway Green also feature two extended “gravity line” trails, each now 80 yards longer, as well as new entry plazas, benches, and wayfinding signage. PP&R repaved the pump track. Trails and plantings were refreshed. New signs are planned for later this year.\nIt's a key amenity for East Portland neighborhoods and communities including Maywood Park, Madison South, Montavilla, Parkrose, Parkrose Heights, Sumner, Woodland Park, and Hazelwood.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
