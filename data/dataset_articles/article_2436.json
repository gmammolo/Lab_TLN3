  "text": "Additional District and Sessions Judge Chaudhry Majid Hussain Gadhi has sentenced Rizwan Habib to death for the murder of his former wife, American citizen Wajiha Swati.\nThe verdict comes in a case that garnered international attention due to its gruesome nature and cross-border implications.\nAccording to the judgment, Habib lured Swati to Pakistan under the pretext of resolving a long-standing property dispute worth billions of rupees.\nUpon her arrival from the United States on October 16, 2021, he murdered her, mutilated the body, and buried it in a remote area on his ancestral land in Hangu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe court found Habib guilty on multiple counts. In addition to the death sentence, he was fined Rs0.5 million.\nHe also received a 10-year prison sentence and a Rs0.1 million fine for kidnapping, and a 7-year sentence with another Rs0.1 million fine for destroying evidence and mutilating the corpse.\nHabib's domestic employee, Sultan, was also convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison along with a Rs1 million fine for assisting in the abduction, murder, and disposal of the body.\nAnother accused, Habib's father Huryatullah, who was a co-conspirator in the case, passed away during the trial and was removed from the proceedings.\nThe judge remarked that the accused had exploited the sanctity of a blood relationship to commit a heinous crime and thus did not deserve any leniency.\nThe court ordered that the convict be hanged until death.\nAt the time of the verdict, three US diplomats and a US FBI officer were present in the courtroom.\nThey expressed satisfaction with the ruling, bowed their heads upon hearing the sentence, and thanked the court before returning to the US embassy in Islamabad. The American officials had been closely following the case from the beginning.\nAfter the murder, Habib had pretended that Swati had gone missing and even filed a false report.\nHowever, following his arrest, he confessed to the crime. The police later recovered the body from Hangu.\nSwati's son Abdullah had registered the FIR online from the US with Rawalpindi's Morgah police station, and her sister also recorded a statement via video call.\nAlthough Habib had previously been sentenced to death, the High Court had remanded the case for retrial, which led to the reaffirmation of the death sentence.\nSwati's remains were repatriated to the United States, where the FBI had a second post-mortem examination conducted. The forensic report confirmed that the cause of death was severe torture, with multiple skull fractures noted.\nProsecutor Iffat Sultana represented the victim's side in court. After the sentence was announced, Rizwan Habib stated that he intended to challenge the verdict in the high court.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
