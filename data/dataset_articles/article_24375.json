  "text": "Aurora activity likely to increase with geomagnetic storm watch in effect Two coronal mass ejections are expected to reach Earth this week, increasing the chances of seeing the northern lights over Alaska on Thursday and Friday nights ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - A strong G3 geomagnetic storm watch is in effect for Thursday through Saturday night. Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center issued the watch as two coronal mass ejections are expected to reach Earth this week, causing increased geomagnetic activity. The effects include a more active aurora visible across much of the northern U.S. There is also the potential for minor impacts to some technological infrastructure. As the aurora activity strengthens, Southern Alaska will also see a storm delivering clouds to large portions of the region. Mostly cloudy skies are likely across much of Southwest, Southcentral, and Southeast late Thursday night through Saturday morning. Anchorage and locations north will see breaks in the clouds before 11 p.m. Thursday, and then again late Friday through Saturday morning. More clearing is likely north of Talkeetna. If you see the aurora, share your photos with the Alaska’s Weather Source team [here](https://ugc.zeam.com/app/gallery?albumId=1438&theme=default). Copyright 2024 KTUU. All rights reserved.",
