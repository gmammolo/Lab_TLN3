  "text": "NORRISTOWN — The Elmwood Park Zoo will launch Zoo-on-Wheels next year, with the initiative expected to bring programming to more than 400 schools and community groups when it gets up and running in January 2025.\n“We strive to be a zoo for everyone, and our Zoo-on-Wheels program enables us to be that by taking the zoo out into the community,” said Elmwood Park Zoo Executive Director and CEO Al Zone in a statement.\nElmwood Park Zoo nears completion on development’s first phase\nThe initiative was supported with a “community partnership” between the Norristown-based zoo and KeyBank, according to a KeyBank spokesperson, which involves a three-year sponsorship contract that includes branding opportunities for the bank. An October 1 event cemented the newfound commitment between the two organizations.\n“As a community-minded bank, KeyBank believes in investing in organizations that add to the health and vitality of the communities where we do business,” KeyBank Eastern Pennsylvania Market President Youseff Tannous said in a statement. “Our new sponsorship with Elmwood Park Zoo is a great way to support the educational initiatives the zoo provides to the community, including its Zoo-On-Wheels program. It also enables us to promote KeyBank’s brand, entertain clients, show our support for Montgomery County, and enjoy all that the zoo offers to local residents.”\nElmwood Park Zoo CEO and Executive Director Al Zone, left, and KeyBank Eastern Pennsylvania Market President Youseff Tannous, pose for a photo on Oct. 1, 2024 at the Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown.
