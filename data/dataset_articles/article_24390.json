Excerpts:\nYour company is into waste management and recycling, what area of recycling are you into and why?\nI specialise in recycling waste plastics and industrial nylon films.\nI chose this field because there is a readily available market both locally and internationally.\nWhat are the potential opportunities in this business?\nThe opportunities in waste plastics recycling are significant and diverse.\nWaste plastics recycling presents several potential opportunities, including; environmental benefits; economic benefits, innovations and technological advancement; resources conservation; job creation, products diversity and corporate sustainability.\nFor environmental benefit, recycling waste plastics reduces the amount of plastics waste that ends up in the landfills or the natural environment, which can have significant environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and reducing the harm of plastics on wildlife.\nRecycling waste can create economic opportunities in various ways, such as creating jobs in the recycling industry, reducing the cost of waste management for municipalities and businesses, and creating new markets for recycled plastic products.\nResources conservation; recycling plastic reduces the need for new plastics to be produced, which conserves natural resources such as oil and gas.\nRecycling plastic waste can be cheaper than producing new plastic, particularly if the plastic waste is sorted and cleaned before recycling.\nThe recycling industry creates jobs in the collection, sorting, processing, and manufacturing of recycled plastic products.\nHow lucrative is the recycling business?\nThe waste plastic recycling business in Nigeria can be a lucrative venture if it is approached strategically and with the right resources.\nHowever, there are several factors that can affect the profitability of the business.\nLarger businesses with the capacity to process more waste and produce higher volumes of recycled products are likely to be more profitable than smaller ones. Availability and cost of raw materials, if the cost of raw materials is high it may be difficult to generate profit.\nAccess to funding is crucial for the success of any business, including waste plastics recycling. Waste plastic recycling can be a profitable business in Nigeria, especially with the increasing awareness of the importance of recycling and the growing demand of importance of recycling and the growing demand for sustainable products.\nDo one need any form of training before venturing into this business?\nYes, it’s important to have some training before starting a waste plastic recycling business. While the recycling business may seem simple, it requires specific knowledge and skills to ensure that the process is safe, efficient, and effective. You must understand the type of plastics.\nDifferent types of plastics have different properties and require different recycling methods, knowing how to identify and sort the various types of plastics is crucial for an effective recycling process.\nYou must have the knowledge of the recycling process; knowing the different processes involved in recycling plastics, such as shredding, washing, and melting, is important to ensure successful and profitable operations.\nTraining can help you develop business management skills and strategies for marketing and promoting your recycling business.\nHow do you source for wastes?\nWaste plastics can be obtained from various sources for recycling.\nWaste plastics can be collected from households through collection programs, door to door collection, and drop-off centers.\nBusinesses, offices, factories, and other industrial establishments generate significant amounts of waste plastics that can be collected for recycling.\nLandfills and dumpsites are also potential sources of waste plastics.\nHowever, it is important to ensure that the waste collected from this site is sorted to avoid contamination.\nThere are informal sectors of waste pickers who collect waste plastics from streets, markets, and other public places.\nThese waste pickers can be a source of waste plastics for recycling.\nTo start a waste plastics recycling business, you need to establish a reliable supply chain for waste plastics.\nThis can involve working with waste collection companies, partnering with waste pickers and informal sectors, or establishing your own collection network.\nIt is important to ensure that the waste plastic you collect is clean, sorted, and free from contaminants to ensure the quality of the recycled materials.\nWhat type of equipment do you need to recycle, how affordable are they?\nOperating a waste plastics recycling factory in Nigeria requires a variety of equipment depending on the scale of the operation.\nSome of the necessary equipment includes; Shredder, this is used to shred the plastic waste into smaller pieces, which can then be processed further.\nThe cost of a shredder machine ranges from $2,000 to $50,000, depending on the size and capacity. Melting machine, this includes extruders and injection molding machines for melting and molding plastics waste into new products.\nThe cost of an extruder or melting machine ranges from $10,000 to $100,000, depending on the size and capacity.

This has made it difficult for recycling companies to access the funding and resources needed to expand their operations.\nPoor quality of recyclable materials, the quality of plastic waste in Nigeria is often poor, making it difficult to recycle, this is due to lack of separation at the source and the poor handling during transportation, leading to contamination and reducing the value of the recyclables materials.\nLack of adequate policies, regulations discourage investment in recycling business- Inadequate policies, Nigeria lacks adequate policies and regulations to support waste management, including plastics recycling, this makes it difficult for companies to operate within a structured legal framework and discouraged investment in the sector, another challenge is limited market.\nIf someone wants to go into this line of business what advice would you give?\nStarting a waste plastic recycling business can be a great idea for those who are passionate about the environment and sustainability.\nHere are some steps to take: Conduct market research, before starting any business, it is essential to conduct thorough market research to understand the demand for your products, the competition, and the pricing strategies of your competitors.\nYou need to identify potential customers, such as companies that use plastics or recycled plastics products.\nAlso create a business plan, obtain the necessary permit and license from the Lagos waste management authority (LAWMA). Secure funding because starting a waste plastics recycling business can be capital intensive.\nYou also need to develop a marketing strategy to promote your business and attract customers. Starting a waste plastics recycling business requires hard work, dedication, and careful planning.\nHowever, with the right approach and mindset, you can build a successful and profitable business that contributes to a more sustainable future.",
