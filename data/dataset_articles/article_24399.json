  "text": "Paul Purvis is an agronomist based at Elders Trangie and Warren in New South Wales. Paul has worked with Elders for over two years, supporting clients' broadacre cropping and pasture programs, with a focus on cotton.\nSince joining Elders, Paul has been working closely with one of the region's largest cotton growers, Agriland. His work is focused on their 1600-hectare cotton program, situated on their 8000-hectare farm located between Trangie and Narromine.\n\"In collaboration with Dubbo Agronomist Rochelle Field and Trangie Graduate Agronomist Bridgette Howe, we provide crop monitoring support throughout the seasons, increasing our level of support during key periods,\" Paul said.\n\"Agriland's operation is quite expansive, with us supporting the seasonal production cycle of the crop as before it goes to the nearby cotton gin operated by Australia Food and Fibre.\"\nPaul said that the season this year in the Central West tracked really well due to mild weather conditions and reasonable water availability.\n\"We experienced very mild conditions this year, with no periods of heat shock, low secondary insect pressures and efficient water availability, all leading to positive yield volumes,\" he said.\n\"Most growers completed harvesting by May, however some with larger crops faced delays due to significant rainfall. Remarkably, crops that remained in the field for five months during this wet period have shown promising yield and quality, a testament to the overall durability of cotton.\"\nIn a step that will allow for additional growth and capacities for future seasons in the region, an Elders fertiliser shed has been constructed on the same stretch of Agriland property.\n\"Customer feedback really highlighted the need for the facility,\" Paul said.\n\"We want to remain competitive and meet the needs of our loyal customers, without driving them to seek needed services elsewhere,\" Set to be operational this month, the fertiliser shed will benefit both the Elders business and customers alike.\n\"Our clients will now have the convenience of bulk purchasing and flexibility of accessing smaller quantities\" Paul said.\n\"In bad weather, delivery trucks can face challenges. Our prime location offers a safe drop-off point, straight off the highway, to combat these issues.\"\nThe Elders Warren branch, which opened its doors in April , has been well received by local residents with almost 100 attending the opening.\n\"We have young and enthusiastic staff at the branch, who are eager to establish themselves in the area and build long lasting client relationships,\" Paul said\n\"Our key point of difference for the area has been our diverse service offerings.\" \"The branch has been hosting information nights and events, enabling us to connect with clients involved in mixed cropping operations to foster strong, future business relationships.\"\nDisclaimer\nElders Ltd. published this content on October 03, 2024 and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.
