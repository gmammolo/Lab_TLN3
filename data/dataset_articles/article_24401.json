  "text": "Friday, October 04 2024, 08:51 AM Friday, October 04 2024, 08:51 AM Ahmedabad may not make it to the top of the list of India’s cleanest cities this year but, with proper work, the target can be achieved in next year’s Swachh Survekshan, said Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday. In Gujarat for two days, Shah was speaking at an event organised by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation in Bhadaj area. He inaugurated and laid the foundation stones of projects costing Rs 447 crore. Ahmedabad city is part of the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency which is represented by Shah. In Swachh Survekshan 2023, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Surat in Gujarat were jointly declared the cleanest cities in the country. “The AMC is aiming to bring the city on top in Swachh Survekshan. We may not achieve that target this year. But, if we start today, we can achieve the target of being the cleanest city in the country in next year’s survey,” Shah said, adding he would be meeting civic officials to chalk out a plan in this connection. “I urge all the citizens to take a resolve on cleanliness and cooperate with the AMC in its endeavour to make Ahmedabad the cleanest city in the country,” he said. Shah informed the audience that developmental works costing Rs 37,000 crore were undertaken in his Lok Sabha constituency during the last five years, comprising works costing Rs 23,951 crore approved by the Gujarat government and projects costing Rs 14,000 crore approved by the Centre. “This is a huge achievement and I am proud to be your representative in the Lok Sabha. These projects include roads, overbridges, hospitals, libraries, gardens, schools and lake beautification,” he said.",
