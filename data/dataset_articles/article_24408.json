  "text": "Lowcountry Land Trust, the nonprofit dedicated to protecting Lowcountry land and water, in partnership with the Phillips Community Association and its residents, today announced the protection of the historic Rutledge Tomb, a key cultural landmark within the Phillips Community. This initiative represents a significant step in safeguarding the rich legacy of Phillips, a settlement community listed on the [National Register of Historic Places](https://usw2.nyl.as/t1/314/3gw9436o4ed4js7boae4m91ju/3/8ce05d3885ff724e666b216b639245f8c63ec477b8fa508787306745057337bb). This protection and restoration project will transform the 3,300-square-foot site into a publicly accessible green space, with the Rutledge Tomb preserved as its centerpiece, providing a vital connection to the area’s plantation history and honoring the community’s relationship with the land. The Rutledge Tomb is a rare and significant historical feature within Phillips, a community established by formerly enslaved people after the Civil War. Phillips landowners have kept land plots within the same family for generations. This remarkable continuity makes it the only African American settlement community listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tomb, believed to be the only remaining physical connection to the plantation era, serves as a powerful symbol of the community’s resilience and the complex history of the land. Its preservation within this project ensures that this essential piece of history will continue to be a tangible reminder of the area’s journey from enslavement to empowerment. The Warren Lasch Conservation Center at Clemson University will lead the restoration work, and the park will connect to the Mount Pleasant Way trail system, further integrating the site into the community. This protected space will safeguard the tomb and serve as a historic stop along the trail, offering a unique glimpse into the past while remaining a historical resource to the community. “It is our honor to have been asked by Richard and the community to help protect this important historical site,\" said Sam Seawell, Community Lands Director of Lowcountry Land Trust. \"Preservation of the Rutledge Tomb will allow current and future generations to interpret and understand the true history of the Phillips Community, the only African American settlement community recognized on the National Register of Historic Places.” The protection of the Rutledge Tomb site within the Phillips Community was made possible through the efforts of Richard Habersham, President of the Phillips Community Association, who negotiated the sale from Phillips resident Lamar Rouse to Lowcountry Land Trust, then to the Phillips Community Association to ensure the space become community-owned community land. Funding from the Charleston County Greenbelt Program and the Preservation Society of Charleston helped to secure the site, ensuring the community retains control over its own story and the land that holds its historical legacy. A community celebration event will follow the completion of the tomb’s restoration to honor this achievement.
