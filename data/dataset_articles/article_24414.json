  "text": "In a bid to enhance agricultural productivity and promote sustainable practices, stakeholders in Bauchi State have advocated for the widespread adoption of organic fertiliser.\nThis call was made at a lecture organised by the Agriculture Stakeholders Interactive Forum in Bauchi State, which was organised to educate farmers and other stakeholders on the benefits of organic farming.\nArewa PUNCH reports that the forum, which also aimed at focusing on the production and use of organic fertilisers, quoted the Chairman of the Forum, Rafilawus Yohanna as emphasising “the importance of utilising materials readily available in the environment to produce organic fertilisers.”\nYohanna explained that “The forum provided a comprehensive overview of organic farming techniques, including compost-making and the proper application of organic fertilisers.\n“Using organic fertilisers offers a holistic approach to agriculture, addressing environmental, economic, social, and health benefits.”\nAlso speaking, the representative of Smart Agricultural Consultancy, Bala Usman, echoed similar sentiments, highlighting the numerous advantages of organic fertilisers over synthetic alternatives.\nHe also pointed out the environmental impact of synthetic fertilisers, particularly their contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer.\nThe agric consultant stressed that “Organic fertilisers do not only boost agricultural production but also protect the environment and promote human health.”\nArewa PUNCH reports further that the stakeholders called on government agencies, civil society groups, and the private sector to support the adoption of organic fertilisers and promote sustainable agricultural practices in the state.\nThe Forum noted that as the drive for sustainable agriculture gains momentum, its participants remain hopeful that organic farming will play a key role in addressing environmental challenges, boosting food production, and improving the livelihoods of farmers in Bauchi State.",
