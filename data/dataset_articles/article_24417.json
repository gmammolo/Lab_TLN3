  "text": "The Nolichucky Dam outside Greenville has been doing its job of holding back The Nolichucky River since 1913. And even when the deadly storm pushed it lightyears past its limit last week, it somehow held strong, saving an untold number of lives. According to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the Nolichucky Dam withstood nearly twice the water flow of the iconic Niagara Falls during Hurricane Helene—an incomprehensible amount of water. By 11pm on the night of September 27, the Nolichucky River was rising at two feet per hour. At this point, approximately 1.3 million gallons of water were pouring over the dam each second. For comparison, the peak daily water flow of Niagara Falls is around 700,000 gallons per second. \"That gives you a sense of how large of a rainfall event that we're looking at dealing with here,\" Will Reid, deputy commissioner and chief engineer of TDOT, said during a virtual news conference a few days later, per the Knoxville News Sentinel. The next day, officials announced that the dam was intact and that river levels were receding at approximately one foot per hour. “We have determined the dam is stable and secure,” TVA wrote on Facebook September 28. At its highest point, the Nolichucky Dam water elevation hit 1266.0’, which is 9.5 feet over the record elevation of 1256.5’ set on November 6, 1977. TVA is calling the rainfall at the Nolichucky River watershed a one-in-5,000-year event. Hurricane Helene Closes Blue Ridge Parkway Indefinitely In North Carolina Was this page helpful?
