BAT Vietnam and Gaia jointly organized ESG Day 2024 in Ca Mau Cape National Park. Photo courtesy of Gaia | The importance of forests to the environment and human life is undeniable. According to i-Tree, a software developed by the U.S. Forest Service for assessing and managing forests, afforestation removes approximately 31.6 million tons of carbon, absorbs about 372 million kilograms of air pollution, and prevents 5,530 million gallons of stormwater runoff. McKinsey & Company further emphasizes that afforestation is a critical solution for carbon sequestration, significantly supporting Vietnam's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In Vietnam, saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta has become increasingly severe, with many provinces experiencing a decline in seasonal water levels, loss of alluvium, and diminishing aquaculture resources. The situation is exacerbating soil degradation and threatening the region's biodiversity. According to the Meteorological and Hydrological Administration, Vietnam is among the six countries most severely affected by climate change. By 2100, nearly 40% of the Mekong Delta could be submerged. Regenerating mangrove forests is thus crucial for combating saltwater intrusion, sequestering carbon, and preserving biodiversity. Studies show that mangrove forests can sequester 4 to 10 times more carbon than terrestrial forests and play a vital role in bridging marine and terrestrial ecosystems, offering an ideal habitat for a diverse range of species. This underscores BAT Vietnam's initiative to regenerate and conserve mangrove forests in Ca Mau Cape National Park from 2022 to 2024. Numerous mangrove saplings have emerged in areas regenerated by BAT Vietnam in 2022. Photo courtesy of Gaia | Through this afforestation project, launched in 2022 in partnership with Gaia, BAT Vietnam reaffirms its commitment to two key sustainability priorities: biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. \"BAT Vietnam acknowledges that, in addition to our internal efforts to address climate change within our value chain, we must collaborate with the government, agencies, organizations, and other stakeholders to restore degraded forests and protect biodiversity,\" said Do Hoang Anh, Head of Corporate and Regulatory Affairs at BAT Vietnam Cluster. In 2024, BAT Vietnam continues working with Gaia to convert 40 hectares of mudflats into mangrove forests in Ca Mau Cape National Park. To mark the start of this year's project, BAT Vietnam hosted the ESG Day with 50 employees, who contributed hundreds of volunteer hours. Employees and volunteers from Gaia, along with officers from the Ca Mau Cape National Park Management Board, helped build fences and install nets to protect areas earmarked for mangrove growth. This marks the third consecutive year of BAT Vietnam's ESG Day, featuring afforestation activities in Ca Mau Cape. BAT Vietnam and Gaia are regenerating 40 hectares of mudflats into forests in Ca Mau Cape National Park. Photo courtesy of Gaia | Jahid Shafique, Head of Human Resources, Culture, and Inclusion at BAT Vietnam, emphasized the broader significance of this initiative. \"BAT Vietnam's afforestation project with Gaia is not just an environmental effort; it also reflects our core value of ‘Do the Right Thing' by prioritizing sustainability and environmental responsibility.\" \"The zoning, regeneration activities, and knowledge gained about mangrove forests during ESG Day not only deepen our team's understanding of environmental protection but also foster internal solidarity, strengthening the company's sense of responsibility,\" he added. BAT Vietnam's afforestation project fosters solidarity and responsibility among team members. Photo courtesy of Gaia | In 2022 and 2023, BAT Vietnam and Gaia successfully regenerated 80 hectares of mudflats into forest in Ca Mau Cape National Park and planted 4 hectares of forest in Dong Nai Culture and Nature Reserve. Over the three years of the program, a total of 124 hectares have been afforested in these regions. Both organizations will continue to monitor and maintain these areas in the coming years to ensure a high survival rate for the newly growing mangroves. Reports indicate that the areas regenerated in 2022 and 2023 have seen a significant number of mangrove saplings emerging. These saplings will be nurtured to grow into healthy, mature mangrove forests in Ca Mau Cape in the coming years. Do Thi Thanh Huyen, Founder and General Director of Gaia Nature Conservation, acknowledged the challenges of reforestation, stating: \"Regenerating and caring for forests is a challenging journey. We are deeply grateful for companies like BAT Vietnam, who demonstrate vision and commitment by partnering with us to build ecologically valuable forests.\" \"These forests protect water resources, mitigate the damage caused by typhoons and floods, combat climate change, and provide habitats for numerous species, contributing to Vietnam's 1 billion trees initiative by 2025,\" she added.",
