  "text": "Sonam Wangchuk released, visits Rajghat\nClimate activist Sonam Wangchuk and other activists were allowed to visit Rajghat late on October 2 after he released by the Delhi Police.\n| Video Credit:\nThe Hindu\nClimate activist Sonam Wangchuk was released by the Delhi Police and allowed to visit Rajghat on Wednesday (October 2, 2024).\nMr. Wangchuk and about 120 others had been detained on Monday night (October 1, 2024) as they marched to the capital seeking constitutional safeguards for Ladakh.\nMany of those detained were on a hunger strike. They said a sense of uncertainty prevailed during the day about their release.\nFinally, four or five buses carrying those who had been detained were allowed to go to Rajghat at different times of the day, in the presence of heavy police deployment.\nMr. Wangchuk and other volunteers had embarked on a foot march from Leh to New Delhi to urge the Centre to resume dialogue with Ladakh’s leadership regarding their demands. One of their key demands is to include Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, granting law-making powers to the local population to protect their land and cultural identity.\nProtesters outside Rajghat demanding Sixth Schedule for— The Hindu (@the_hindu)[#Ladakh]as Delhi Police dispersed the crowd.\n🎥Satvika Mahajan ([@SatvikaMahajan])[pic.twitter.com/GTH7mt0zah][October 2, 2024]\nMany of the protesters said they have been sitting on a hunger strike.\nKhadim, one of the protesters, said, “We were kept at different locations. Many of our phones were taken away as well.” Several other senior citizens who joined the ‘Delhi Chalo Padyatra’ said they had had blisters on their feet.\nAmid heavy police presence at Rajghat, where Delhi Police have prohibited the gathering of more than five persons, an officer said that additional security teams have been deployed to maintain law and order in the area.\nPublished - October 02, 2024 08:51 pm IST",
