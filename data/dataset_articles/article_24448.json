  "text": "World Animal Day is celebrated every year on October 4 to raise awareness about animal rights and welfare. The day highlights the importance of treating the Earth as a shared space for humans and animals alike. This year, the theme for World Animal Day is “The world is their home too.” October 4 was chosen to align the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, a patron saint of animals and the environment. Here is a list of rare animals that are found in India's jungles: (Image: Reuters) Blackbuck | Also known as Indian antelope, Blackbuck is found in India. With spiral horns and charming colour, they are the state animal of the Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh. You can spot these animals in Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Velavadar Blackbuck National Park (Gujarat) and Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh). The major causes of the disappearance of this animal are habitat fragmentation, urbanisation, poaching, habitat destruction, and neglect. To increase the population, Blackbucks have also been introduced in Argentina and the United States. (Image Reuters) Asiatic Lion | Found only in India and restricted to the Gir National Park in Gujarat, Asiatic lions are slightly smaller than African lions. This endangered species is threatened by poaching and habitat fragmentation. (Image: Gir National Park) Lion-Tailed Macaque | Found in the Western Ghats of South India, the Lion-Tailed Macaque is placed in the 'endangered' category in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The reason behind their name is their prominent mane and tails, which appear like lions. Lion-tailed macaques are usually shy, avoid interacting with people, and prefer to move around in groups. (Image: Reuters) Red Panda | Also known as red-cat bear, the red panda is a small mammal usually found on the bamboo trees sleeping and playing. They can be spotted in the forests of Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal. The Red Panda is listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. (Image: Reuters) Asian Elephant | Considered amongst the biggest land animals in the world, Asian elephants are found in four fragmented populations in the south, north, central and northeast of India. They are also listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
