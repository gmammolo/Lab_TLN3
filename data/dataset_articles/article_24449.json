Participants provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of innovation in higher education, as well as international perspectives on Vietnam's innovation landscape. Speaking at the seminar, Vu Quoc Huy, Director of NIC, emphasized the importance of innovation in the higher education system and its role in achieving the goal of building a prosperous nation. He expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the cooperation between domestic and foreign universities and NIC to train quality human resources.

Dr. Sarah Mamiese, Director of the AFD Campus, praised Vietnam's recent strides in innovation, particularly the establishment of the NIC as a symbol of successful innovation that reflects the nation's passionate commitment to progress. Tran Nam Tu, Deputy Director General of the Department of Science, Technology and Environment at the Ministry of Education and Training, suggested that the higher education system identify which institutions have the capacity to innovate and which have the potential but don't currently use it. He noted that innovation depends not only on individuals, but also on leadership and the entire system. \"This approach will provide a comprehensive view of innovation in Vietnamese universities and help refine effective policies,\" Tu stressed. The Deputy General Director announced that the Ministry of Education and Training plans to launch two initiatives, including \"Training Human Resources for High-Tech Development (2025-2035)\" and \"Developing High-Quality Human Resources for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\" Tu added that these initiatives aim to build a strong workforce in high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, positioning Vietnam to attract investment from leading global tech firms. These efforts will support economic restructuring and sustainable development through science, technology, innovation, digital transformation, and green initiatives.
