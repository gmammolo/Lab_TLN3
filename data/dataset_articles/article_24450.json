  "text": "City of Belton signs letter of support for Central Texas Water Alliance BELTON, Texas (KWTX) - The city of Belton is one of the first cities to support an effort to find new sources of water. The newly-formed Central Texas Water Alliance is seeking a long-time water supply for future generations. The plan is in its infancy but city and Bell County leaders are trying to get the wheels in motion before this upcoming legislative session. With Texas’ population continuing to grow and showing no signs of slowing down, the city of Belton is signing up to support getting ahead of future water woes. “We may be one of the first entities to show support but what I think you’re going to see over the next few weeks is water district boards showing their support, other cities, other counties,” says city of Belton spokesperson, Paul Romer. Romer says the city council voted unanimously to join this alliance because while Lake Belton serves the area well, the water supply isn’t endless. \"Our role at this point is a support role. We think this is a good idea, we think this will benefit residents in the future so our council is behind making this move,” he explains. Since 1954, Lake Belton has supplied generation of families with water but 70 years later and experts say new supply options are needed. Getting cities like Belton on board is laying the groundwork for a bill so Bell County Judge David Blackburn can file the legislation that will put them closer to being able to search for new sources. \"The framework that we’re talking about right now is to create a water authority which requires legislation by the state legislature,” says Judge Blackburn. Representatives like Brad Buckley have already showed his support and with about a month to go before the legislative filing date on November first, Judge Blackburn says they are working around the clock to start making this a reality. “Letters of support resolutions, that’s the first step in this process. Identify who might be interested in participating in creating a water authority. Once we have that list, we can get a bill drafted,” he says. Copyright 2024, KWTX. All rights reserved.",
