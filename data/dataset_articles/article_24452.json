  "text": "Denver and Arvada are each getting millions of dollars from the federal government for two parks that have faced challenges over the years.\nIn Denver, the money will go to La Alma-Lincoln Park, where the city recently put up fences in response to complaints of crime and drug use. In Arvada, the money will go to a major revamp of Gold Strike Park, an often overlooked but historical site near Interstate 76.\nThe funding, announced last week, is coming from the U.S. Department of the Interior and its Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership Program (ORLP). The program distributed more than $250 million to about 50 projects around the country.\nDenver and Arvada were among the biggest winners. Denver got the 9th largest award in the federal package, while Arvada got the 11th largest. They were the only recipients in Colorado.\nThe money is meant to serve communities lacking in parks and recreation, \"and where there are significant populations of people or are economically disadvantaged,\" according to Interior.\nLa Alma-Lincoln Park is getting $8.4 million for fixes and new features.\nIn Denver, the money will help with construction of La Alma-Lincoln Park's 2023 Vision Plan, which includes a new skating loop and a \"rhythm skate plaza,\" described as a \"smooth open multi-use surface\" that can also host other kinds of gatherings. The park is in the Lincoln Park neighborhood near 13th Avenue and Mariposa Street.\nThe plan also calls for expanded playgrounds, new grass and trees, new fencing, new lighting, replacing the existing tennis and basketball courts, restoring the amphitheater and bring the park into compliance with the Americans for Disabilities Act — among other stuff.\n\"The park has experienced deterioration in many of its core structures and elements and much of the infrastructure is at the end of its useful life,\" Stephanie Figueroa, a Denver Parks and Rec spokesperson, told us in an email. \"Providing high-quality park space while maintaining the strong character and history of the park is an ongoing, critical need.\"\nIn August, the city closed the park's green spaces, saying it was a response to drug sales and violent incidents. It was similarly closed in 2022 after a deadly shooting there.\nFigueroa added that La Alma-Lincoln Park is high on the city's list of priorities, according to a set of equity metrics that Parks and Rec developed to decide which parts of town need the most love.\nThere's no word yet on a construction timeline or overall project budget. We'll update if we get more details.\nThe city council previously did some strategic money maneuvering to improve its chances of winning federal money for the park. The city moved money meant to rehab Civic Center Park's Greek Amphitheatre to a fund for La Alma-Lincoln Park. The Civic Center project was getting pushed back, and officials thought they could leverage that money to apply for even more money from the federal government.\nArvada won $7.3 million for Gold Strike Park.\nGold Strike Park sits just north of Interstate 76, on the east side of Arvada. If you've ever noticed a big, white pedestrian bridge just off the highway, that's an entrance to the park.\nIt's not a particularly exciting place at the moment — basically just a field, a few pathways and some lonely public art. Many users pass through it on bike or foot as they use the Ralston Creek Trail on the way from Denver to Olde Town Arvada.\nThe city has big plans for the area, including adding a \"nature playground,\" a water play area, creek crossings, a pedestrian bridge, an event lawn, a pavilion and a garden. Gold Strike Park marks the location where settlers first recorded a gold strike in Colorado — the confluence of Clear Creek and Ralston Creek.\nThe revamp is expected to break ground in 2025, with completion by 2028 and a total budget of about $14.7 million\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Oct. 3, 2024 at 7:15 p.m. with additional information about the timing and budget of the Arvada project.",
