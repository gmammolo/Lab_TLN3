  "text": "The government has pledged up to £21.7bn to develop two massive carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) hubs – while new research shows the huge potential for the technology in the UK. Additionally, Jacobs has been appointed by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to deliver technical project management support to the UK’s CCUS programme. Prime minister Keir Starmer has today, 4 October, confirmed the funding for the East Coast Cluster on Teesside and the HyNet hub in the north west and north Wales, which are expected to deliver a combined 8.5Mt of CO₂ holding capacity per year and generate 4,000 new jobs. The cash will be made available to the projects over the next 25 years, with construction expected to begin once final investment decisions have been taken by developers. Starmer said: “We’re reigniting our industrial heartlands by investing in the industry of the future. “For the past 14 years, business has been second-guessing a dysfunctional government – which has set us back and caused an economic slump. “Today’s announcement will give industry the certainty it needs to help deliver jobs, kickstart growth and repair this country once and for all.” Government climate adviser the Climate Change Committee (CCC) has previously described CCUS as a “necessity” for the UK if it is to reach net zero by 2050. But the National Audit Office [this summer warned](https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/uk-will-struggle-to-meet-2030-ccus-ambitions-nao-warns-06-08-2024/) that DESNZ would “struggle” to meet its own targets for growing the activity. New research shows potential for CCUS in UK Trade body Offshore Energies UK called for an increase in urgency on CCUS. In a report published today, it hailed a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for this country to become a “global leader in decarbonisation”. It said a £100bn industry could be created and called for delivery of 100 storage facilities by 2050 to collect 50Mt of CO₂ annually. With up to 78bn.t of CO₂ storage possible in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, the UK has the greatest offshore storage potential in Europe, claimed the study. Offshore Energies UK identified six key recommendations to accelerate the development of the CCUS industry in the UK: - Simplify and enhance funding mechanisms for CCS: The government must create clearer, more predictable funding processes beyond current market pricing, which is currently insufficient for CCS. Accelerating the £20bn government support announced in 2023 and creating a route to market for transportation and storage systems and emitters outside of the “Track process” is critical to provide long-term confidence to investors. - Leverage UK’s unique position for CCS leadership: The UK’s significant CO₂ storage potential, existing infrastructure, and local supply chain give it a competitive edge in CCS. To capitalise on this policies must be developed to retain critical supply chains and prevent the need to import technologies. - Facilitate non-pipeline and cross-border CO₂ transportation: Regulatory barriers to non-pipeline CO₂ transportation, especially by ship, must be removed to capitalise our storage capacity, develop an international market for CO₂ storage and decarbonise non-clustered emitters. - CCS as the key to protecting heavy industry and jobs: CCS is crucial to preserving energy-intensive heavy industries and for creating and protecting more than 150,000 jobs across the UK's industrial heartlands. Without CCS, the UK cannot meet its net zero targets. The technology is also expected to add over £100bn to the economy by 2050. - Strengthen carbon pricing and markets for CCS investment: A robust carbon market, including mutual recognition of UK and EU emissions trading schemes, will be critical to underpin CCS investments. Common carbon border adjustment mechanisms and a clear trajectory for carbon pricing are both essential to ensure long-term investment in CCS. - Accelerate CCS projects for energy to meet clean power goals: Deploying carbon capture technologies in gas-fired power plants is vital to achieving the government's 2030 clean power targets by providing low-carbon power to balance renewables . Policies must accelerate funding support for these projects to ensure they move forward. Offshore Energies UK head of energy policy Enrique Cornejo said there was “no viable alternative” to CCUS when looking to decarbonise energy-intensive industries. “Gas-fired power offset with carbon capture will play a critical role in delivering the government’s net zero power ambitions by 2030,” he added. “Starting work on the first two clusters is only the beginning [...] progress must speed up.” Cornejo said many project leaders were uncertain about their eligibility for government support or the timeframe within which they could expect it. “A clear plan for deployment beyond the initial clusters is critical to establish a steady flow of work for the supply chain,” he added. “While 27 CO₂ storage licenses have been awarded so far, more than 100 will be needed by 2050, requiring the rapid and sustained growth of the industry.” Cornejo said the UK industry was “ready to meet the challenge” but called for a pragmatic approach. “Relying on foreign expertise and technology makes little economic sense. Instead, enhancing our existing oil and gas supply chains, which have highly transferable capabilities to CCUS, should be a top priority.” Jacobs’ role Jacobs’ contract with DESNZ will see it deliver technical project management, strategic and change management advisory services, data solutions and risk and quality management to the CCUS programme. Jacobs will also deliver associated strategic support to the Hydrogen and Industrial Carbon Capture program and provide advisory consultancy, end-to-end innovation, design and analytics with strategic partner PA Consulting. PA Consulting will draw on its technology, design and analytics experience to ensure the UK’s approach to carbon capture is innovative and impactful. The contract with DESNZ is for an initial term of two years with an option to extend by up to two additional one-year periods. Jacobs senior vice president Kate Kenny said: “CCUS is an important enabler to the diverse mix of cross-market decarbonization and energy transition solutions needed to meet net-zero ambitions and enhance the U.K.'s energy security for the future. “We bring technical and strategic program management experience across CCUS projects, critical infrastructure and whole energy systems as the CCUS program drives continued development and scaling in deployment.” First CCUS project using existing pipelines In tandem with the government’s funding announcement, The Crown Estate has awarded an Agreement for Lease to global energy company, Eni, for the first carbon capture and storage project in the UK to repurpose existing pipeline infrastructure, reducing both cost and the environmental impact of construction. The Agreement for Lease will enable Eni to access the seabed and repurpose existing pipelines and platforms to transport and store CO2 from the HyNet industrial cluster. This is the second Track 1 project awarded an Agreement for Lease by The Crown Estate in the past year, following an agreement in October 2023 for what could become one of the world’s largest CCS projects, located in the North Sea. Stakeholders discuss positive impact of CCUS investment Energy secretary Ed Miliband said today: “On Monday, 150 years of coal in this country came to an end. Today, a new era begins. “By securing this investment, we pave the way for securing the clean energy revolution that will rebuild Britain’s industrial heartlands. This funding is a testament to the power of an active government working in partnership with businesses to deliver good jobs for our communities.” The East Coast Cluster will be enabled by the Northern Endurance Partnership between BP, Equinor and TotalEnergies. BP UK head Louise Kingham said the government funding represented “another step forward” for the scheme. “Major projects like these have the potential to help stimulate economic growth – supporting thousands of jobs, helping UK companies prosper through the vast supply chains involved and creating the infrastructure to help major industrial companies with their decarbonisation plans,” she added. HyNet consortium lead Eni said Starmer’s announcement was “an important step towards the creation of a new business chain linked to the energy transition”. Chief executive Claudio Descalzi added: “HyNet will become one of the first low-carbon clusters in the world and the project will decarbonise one of the key energy-intensive industrial districts as well as unlock significant economic growth in this region of the UK.\" CCC acting chief executive James Richardson said it was “fantastic” to see funding coming through for the projects. “We can’t hit the country’s targets without CCUS so this commitment to it is very reassuring,\" he added. \"It will no doubt provide comfort to investors and business about the direction of travel for the country. “We know these projects will provide good, reliable jobs in communities that need them. It is important that prosperity for these parts of the country is built into a clean energy future.” The Crown Estate head of infrastructure, coastal & energies Nicola Clay said: “Carbon capture and storage will play a pivotal role in helping the UK reach net zero, and this agreement represents important progress to achieving ambitious carbon capture targets. The Crown Estate is proud to be involved with pioneering projects that support the UK’s transition to net zero and we welcome Eni’s innovative approach to reducing environmental impact by reusing existing transportation and storage infrastructure. “At The Crown Estate, we have a unique ability to look across sectors to manage competing and complementary demands on the seabed. As part of this, we have been collaborating with partners and recently launched our approach to a Marine Delivery Routemap, helping to provide a forward strategy for our marine space. The Routemap aims to support broader objectives across net zero and nature recovery and deliver a thriving marine economy whilst supporting onshore communities.” Great British Energy chair Jürgen Maier said: “Carbon capture and storage is a key part of meeting our clean power targets and decarbonising heavy industry. Working alongside The Crown Estate, Great British Energy will be at the forefront in investing in the latest cutting-edge technology.” National Infrastructure Commission’s Nick Winser said: “This technology is crucial for key industries and the power sector to decarbonise. Today’s announcement is a critical first step in delivering this necessary technology. It’s important government keeps up the pace by implementing its plans for the other industrial clusters and a national transport network to link these emitters with storage, in line with Commission recommendations.” Balfour Beatty Group chief executive Leo Quinn said: “The government’s backing for the UK’s first CCUS plants is a powerful move from ambition to action. These groundbreaking projects will fuel job creation and skills, boost economic growth and, most importantly, position the UK as a leader in the fight against the climate crisis. Balfour Beatty stands ready to help deliver the government's vision for CCUS.” Like what you've read?
