For example, Iceland gets a quarter of its energy from geothermal energy. But Iceland is a geological anomaly. Globally, geothermal energy accounts for just [0.5% of renewable energy](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2023/Feb/Global-geothermal-market-and-technology-assessment#:~:text=Geothermal%20still%20accounts%20for%20a,and%20heating%20and%20cooling%2C%20globally.). But now, the application of fracking technology borrowed from the oil and gas sector could totally revolutionize geothermal energy availability, and possibly even bring it to your own backyard.",
