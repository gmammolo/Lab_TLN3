  "text": "3M announced that its near-term, science-based emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being in line with the 1.5deg C trajectory of the Paris Agreement. This milestone reaffirms 3M's ongoing commitment to climate action, decarbonization of its operations and portfolio of products and continual innovation on behalf of customers around the world. The SBTi provides a framework for companies to set targets according to climate science.\nSBTi offers standards, guidance, and tools for establishing emissions reduction targets. The SBTi has validated the following near-term targets for 3M: Reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse-gas emissions by 52.6% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. Reduce absolute scope 3 emissions by 42% by 2030 from a 2021 baseline.\nThe announcement of the 3M's first scope 3 GHG emissions target - validated by SBTi - is a milestone in the company's journey to account for a portfolio that spans across industries including automotive, protective safety, energy, consumer packaged goods, and electronics. 3M has been documenting and reporting scope 1 and 2 inventory since 2002 and has been developing its scope 3 emissions inventory since 2011 in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. For more than a decade, 3M has been collaborating with customers to provide the data and solutions to meet their sustainability goals.\nShare © S&P Capital IQ - 2024",
