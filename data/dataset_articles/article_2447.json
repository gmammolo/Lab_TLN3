  "text": "Tyreek Hill, wife Keeta getting a divorce? Police respond to ‘domestic assault’ call involving Miami star\nTyreek Hill's wife, Keeta, reportedly said she is filing for divorce\nMiami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is in trouble again. Police were called after the 31-year-old was involved in a domestic dispute with his wife Keeta Hill, ABC affiliate WPLG reported, citing an incident report. According to the report, the NFL star was described as 'very aggressive and impulsive' by his wife's mother, Alesia Vaccaro.\nThe publication further added that Keeta said that she is ‘in the process of filing for a divorce’. Neither the Dolphins WR nor his wife have responded to these claims yet.\nTMZ Sports cited a Sunny Isles Beach Police Department incident report, to add that Keeta's mother told officers that she had called for emergency services after she saw Tyreek throw a computer to the floor. He also reportedly grabbed the couple's daughter. The two are parents to Zev Hill, twins Nakeem and Nyla Hill, Soul Corazon Hill, Tyreek D'Shaun Hill Jr., and Trae Love Hill.\nThe report further added that officers on the scene stated that Keeta told them that she and Tyreek had been arguing frequently and Monday's incident started with a comment that ‘he was not involved enough with their daughter’.\n\"That's when he got irritated,\" officers said Keeta told them. After the Miami Dolphins star ‘grabbed his daughter’, he said: “I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want.” Officials, however, said that the ‘argument never became physical’. No arrests have been made in the matter.\nUnited Stateson topics related to\npolitics,\ncrime, along with national affairs.
