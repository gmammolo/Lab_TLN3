  "text": "National Grid helping restore power to southern states\nNational Grid has dispatched more than 100 upstate New York electric operations specialists to West Virginia to assist Appalachian Power in restoration efforts following the extensive damage brought by Hurricane Helene. The National Grid crews from western, central and eastern New York are expected to arrive in West Virginia this evening to help restore service to affected customers in the region.\n“We are very grateful to our field force for bringing their expertise to where it is needed most,” Sally Librera, president, National Grid New York, said in a news release. “Assisting other energy delivery companies is another important role we play as first responders in times of crises like this.”\nThe company’s New York team will be joined in West Virginia by 50 National Grid electric operation colleagues from Massachusetts. The complexity of power restoration after a catastrophic storm requires significant logistical expertise, along with skilled line workers and specialized equipment, which is why utilities rely on each other for aid.\nNational Grid typically sends crews to assist other utilities following severe storms as part of its mutual assistance program.\nSimilarly, other utilities from across the country and Canada respond to assistance requests from National Grid following severely damaging storms.\nHurricane Helene made landfall in Florida Thursday night as a category 4 hurricane, causing flooding and destruction in its wake. As of Friday evening, more than four million homes and businesses spanning several southern states remained without power.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",
