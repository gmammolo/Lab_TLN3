  "text": "Juneau in Juneau Borough, Alaska — Northwest (North America)\nCh'áak' (Eagle) Kootéeyaa\nKootéeyaa Deiyí • Totem Pole Trail\n[Totem pole effigies, top to bottom]\n• EAGLE\n• WOLF\n• KILLER WHALE\n• THUNDERBIRD\n• BROWN BEAR\nThe Raven and Eagle totem poles honor the Raven and Eagle clans that once were present among our Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian cultures. They include the crests used by clans of both moieties.\nThe diseases brought by Westerners in the 1800s significantly impacted Native communities and the Native population. The population was reduced by nearly 50 percent and a number of villages were abandoned. Some clans became extinct or were severely diminished in numbers and never fully recovered.\nThese totem poles are dedicated to those Raven and Eagle clans and to the ancestors of these clans.\nTOTEM POLE DESIGNS\nTotem pole designs represent clan crests, and they are their most important symbols of their history and identity. They were acquired by ancestors in the ancient past and represent crucial encounters with animal persons and spiritual beings. Other significant recent events in clan histories are also memorialized in crests.\nCARVER\nTommy Joseph, Tlingit Master Artist, Sitka\nApprentices: Kristina M.
