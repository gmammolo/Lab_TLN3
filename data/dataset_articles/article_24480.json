  "text": "The 2024 Red Snapper season was one of Louisiana’s best fishing seasons yet. Thanks to the active management allowed by LA Creel, Louisiana anglers were able to fish Red Snapper for 151 days this year, with the earliest opening (April 15) since the start of state management. The 2024 season also had the most days with a 4-fish daily bag limit since state management went into effect. Following the success of the season, Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) Secretary Madison Sheahan signed a declaration of emergency to close the private recreational and state charter Red Snapper season in state and federal waters off Louisiana at 11:59 p.m. on October 6 due to the state’s allocation having been exceeded. “We would like to thank the 20,000 anglers in Louisiana who have actively contributed to conservation and a very successful Red Snapper Season,” said Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Madison Sheahan. “We look forward to having everyone next spring ready to catch more Red Snapper in the Sportsman’s Paradise.” LA Creel estimates indicate that 966,005 pounds, or 103.4% percent of Louisiana’s 2024 annual private recreational and state charter allocation of 934,587 pounds, have been harvested through September 22. Once all data has been reported through October 6, a final estimate with the complete landings data for the 2024 season will be released. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries serves the Sportsman’s Paradise and promotes fishing opportunity for current and future generations through managing, conserving, and promoting the wise utilization of Louisiana’s renewable fish and wildlife resources, and this Red Snapper season is a prime example. Management of Red Snapper relies upon the participation of anglers in our LA Creel dockside surveys as well as the nearly 20,000 [Recreational Offshore Landing Permit](/page/rolp) holders reported this season who fish offshore. During the majority of the Red Snapper season, Red Snapper anglers were also able to fish for other popular species like Greater Amberjack during both the May and fall seasons for that species, as well as Gray Triggerfish.",
