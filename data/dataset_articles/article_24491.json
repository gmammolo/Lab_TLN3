  "text": "Local I&M crews helping to restore power in hurricane damaged communities FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - Many communities have been left without power in the wake of Hurricane Helene. Some local Indiana Michigan Power crews have been sent out to help those affected by the storm. “We were called into action last Friday,” says Jesse LaFramboise and Erik Schlemmer. They’re just two of the more than 400 who were sent to work in areas of Virgina, Tennessee and Kentucky. LaFramboise says, “I know everybody’s seen it on tv the pictures, probably TikTok, when you’re out here in person, and you see the damage from the flooding, the wind damage, the trees, especially out here in Virgina with the mountains, it’s really heartbreaking.” They explained crews are out there sometimes for 16 hours. LaFramboise says, “For everybody here, even though they’re tired, they’re finding that extra energy to get everyone back in power.” But there’s one thing they didn’t expect to see while they were working. LaFramboise says, “I can’t believe the community is in such high spirits with the devastation I’ve seen. The people have been nothing but gracious, kind, asking us, which is unbelievable, if we need anything from them. Asking us if we’re hungry, need anything to drink, showing and telling us where the damage is.” They’re glad they’ve been able to restore a bit of normalcy in the community. After they got some towns back up and running, LaFramboise says, “You could start to see the lights come on in the community and they started driving by honking their horns and they were actually able to play a football game the night after.” As of right now there is still a lot of damage, they’re working to clean up. I&M crews still don’t know when they’ll be able to return home. Copyright 2024 WPTA. All rights reserved.",
