  "text": "Andrea Piacquadio/Pexels Maximizing your vehicle’s efficiency isn’t just about engine performance—your daily driving habits also influence it. Many motorists unknowingly engage in behaviors that lead to higher gas consumption, wear and tear, and reduced overall performance. Here are 15 everyday habits that could be sabotaging your vehicle’s efficiency without you even realizing it.\nIgnoring Regular Checkups Gustavo Fring/Pexels Skipping oil changes, tire rotations, and filter replacements can significantly reduce your car’s efficiency. Worn-out components and dirty fluids make your engine work harder, which inevitably decreases gas economy and causes unnecessary stress on critical systems.\nAggressive Driving Habits JÉSHOOTS/Pexels Rapid acceleration, hard braking, and excessive speeding are fuel-wasting habits. Such aggressive driving behaviors can reduce mileage even on highways and in city traffic. Smooth and gradual driving saves gas and lessens strain on your engine, brakes, and transmission.\nIdling for Long Periods shivaphotographyy/Pixabay Letting your engine idle for long wastes gas without providing any benefit. Modern engines don’t require lengthy warm-ups, even in colder weather. If you’re stopped for an extended period, like waiting in a drive-thru or during heavy traffic, consider turning off the engine to save fuel.\nDriving Short Distances Frequently Artem Podrez/Pexels Frequent short trips prevent your engine from reaching its optimal operating temperature, causing it to consume more propellant. Cold engines are less efficient and experience more wear. Consolidate errands or walk for short trips to minimize the number of cold starts.\nUsing the Wrong Motor Oil Daniel Andraski/Pexels Using motor oil with the wrong viscosity or not designed for your vehicle can decrease engine efficiency. Thicker oil than recommended creates more friction, making the engine work harder and reducing mileage economy. Always use the manufacturer-recommended motor oil to ensure smooth operation.\nOverusing the Air Conditioning Ammy K/Pexels While air conditioning is essential in hot weather, overusing it significantly affects the engine, increasing consumption. Running the A/C at full blast can decrease fuel efficiency by up to 25%. Use the fan setting or lower the windows at lower speeds whenever possible to reduce A/C dependency.\nNeglecting Aerodynamics Luke Miller/Pexels Driving with roof racks, cargo boxes, or windows down at high speeds disrupts your vehicle’s aerodynamics, forcing the engine to work harder. This decreases fuel efficiency, especially at highway speeds. Remove racks when not in use and keep windows closed on the freeway to minimize drag.\nUsing Cruise Control on Hilly Roads Anne Nygård/Unsplash Cruise control is excellent for maintaining a steady speed on flat roads but struggles on hilly terrain. It tends to over-accelerate uphill, wasting gas. Instead, manually control your speed on inclines to maintain a consistent pace and avoid unnecessary bursts of power that dent your mileage.\nDriving on Underinflated Tires Marco Antonio Casique Reyes/Pexels Underinflated tires create more rolling resistance, forcing the engine to use extra power and increasing consumption. Additionally, they can cause uneven tire wear, reducing traction and safety. Regularly check tire pressure and keep it at the manufacturer’s recommended levels.\nOverloading Your Vehicle kai62/Pixabay Carrying unnecessary weight in your vehicle can significantly impact fuel efficiency. For every extra 100 pounds, mileage drops by roughly 1%. Excess weight strains the engine, making it work harder to accelerate and maintain speed. Remove non-essential items from your car to optimize its performance.\nIgnoring Dashboard Warning Lights Erik Mclean/Pexels Dashboard warning lights indicate potential issues that could hinder your vehicle’s efficiency. Ignoring them could lead to serious mechanical problems, increased fuel consumption, or even costly repairs. Address warning lights immediately to prevent long-term damage to your car.\nUsing Low-Quality Fuel Engin Akyurt/Pexels Using cheap or low-quality gas can lead to engine deposits, reducing efficiency and performance. Such propellants may burn less cleanly, causing the engine to overwork and consume more gasoline. Always opt for high-quality fuel from reputable stations to ensure your car runs efficiently.\nUsing Circuitous Routes Yura Forrat/Pexels We all know the story, your destination is ten minutes away but you are itching for a drive so you take the longer route. Once in a while might be okay but doing this frequently will impact your tank’s numbers. Additionally, you’ll put more miles on your car faster, leading to more trips to the garage.\nSkipping Alignment and Balance Checks Artem Podrez/Pexels Poorly aligned or imbalanced wheels cause uneven tire wear and reduce efficiency by increasing rolling resistance. Misalignment also affects handling, making it harder to steer. Regularly align your wheels to ensure smooth rides, improve mileage, and extend your wheels’ lifespan.\nRiding the Brakes Mario Amé/Pexels By resting your foot on the brake or using it excessively can cause brake drag. This decreases efficiency and wears down the braking system. This habit forces the engine to work harder to maintain speed. Instead, keep a safe distance and anticipate stops to reduce unnecessary braking.",
