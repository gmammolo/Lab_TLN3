  "text": "For those who would like to make a difference to the health of the Uncompahgre River and its watershed, the next couple of weeks offer a few opportunities. The settings for both events are stunning and wildly different. The first takes place this Saturday (Oct. 5) at Ridgway State Park. The one Oct. 12 will be held at Ouray Ice Park. Both are hosted by the Uncompahgre Watershed Partnership (UWP), the Ridgway nonprofit whose mission is to help protect the river and its habitat. This Saturday, the UWP will be partnering with Colorado Parks and Wildlife at Ridgway State Park for a cleanup event at Ridgway Reservoir from 9 a.m.-12 p.m. Meet inside the Dutch Charlie Entrance at the marina boat ramp if you would like to come along, after registering at [uncompaghrewatershed.org](http://uncompaghrewatershed.org). All ages are welcome. Heather Patterson, co-owner of Ridgway’s RIGS Fly Shop & Guide Service, is passionate about this place — and this cleanup. “We have a personal attachment to Ridgway State Park, given that we were the first outfitter permitted here,” she said. “It is an amazing resource that the whole community uses,” and the challenge is that it is getting ever busier. “Now that the state has made it so much easier to access with a cheap pass” — which costs just $29, compared to $80 annually when you register a vehicle through the Division of Motor Vehicles — “more people are taking advantage, rafting or kayaking into the reservoir, fishing at Pa-Co-Chu-Puk, or paddleboarding on the Dallas Creek reservoir section of the park. Whether you’re in favor of dams or not, it’s an amazing resource that people use all the time. From my paddleboard, I’ve witnessed a dragonfly migration cross down from Log Hill and head across the water; I’ve seen a black bear swimming in Dallas Creek. The high country can feel inaccessible to some. What’s amazing and unique about this place is that it is so accessible to so many.” Yet along with “the human imprint,” as Patterson put it, “comes human trash. Last year, we collected everything from monofilament fishing lines to baby diapers, cans and bottles and other assorted trash to an abandoned tire,” Patterson said. “The more people get a sense of what’s being left behind and what the human impact is — it makes a difference” when it comes to our continued motivation to protect these special places. “We had about 30 volunteers come help last year, and we hope for more this Saturday,” Patterson said. Adding to the allure are the swag and free refreshments (the day’s top trash collector will receive a free Black Hole duffel by Patagonia). What’s more, many participants are likely to enjoy a free pontoon ride “to a place where only watercraft can get to,” Patterson said. “You’ll get to see a side of the park that you maybe have never experienced. Last year we had volunteers at Paco, Dutch Charlie, and Dallas Creek. Everybody was everywhere.” All ages are welcome. Next Saturday brings cleanup event number two. Titled “Love Your Gorge,” the annual get-together in and around Ouray Ice Park will be held from 9 a.m.-1:30 p.m. This will be a more-strenuous gathering than the one in Ridgway, held at a higher elevation — Ouray Ice Park goes to 8500’, compared to the waters surrounding Ridgway State Park, which are around 7000’ — and may require different gear. While volunteers at both events should bring sunglasses, hats, proper hiking boots and work gloves, for example, “those working in the gorge will be required to wear helmets,” the UWP’s website notes. “In 2024, we will be removing litter from inside the gorge and along the roads and trails, spreading wood chips on trails, installing weed-information kiosks and planting a couple of trees. Volunteers will also learn about, and give input on, the South Ouray Erosion Control Project.” The three-hour event concludes “with lunch, giveaways and a tour of the park.” Register to attend at [uncompahgrewatershedpartnership.org](http://uncompahgrewatershedpartnership.org).",
