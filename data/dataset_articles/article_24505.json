Photo by Morristown Minute State’s First Comprehensive Funding for Zero-Emission Buses to Improve Health and Safety for Children. MORRIS COUNTY, NJ — In celebration of National Drive Electric Week , Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette has announced $15 million in grants to fund the purchase of 48 electric school buses across New Jersey. This marks the state’s first significant commitment to funding zero-emission school buses, aimed at better protecting the health of schoolchildren and reducing pollution in communities.\nThe grant awards are part of the state’s broader initiative, the Electric School Bus Grant Program , which was authorized by legislation signed by Governor Phil Murphy in 2022 . The program, administered by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and funded by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities’ (NJBPU) Clean Energy Fund, aims to provide up to $45 million over three years for the replacement of diesel school buses with battery-electric buses and installation of charging infrastructure.\n“It is our responsibility as elected officials to ensure that the vehicles carrying our children to school do not adversely affect their health outcomes as they grow. That’s why my Administration has dedicated $30 million to date to ensuring that those vehicles are powered by clean energy,” said Governor Phil Murphy .\nDiesel exhaust from traditional school buses contains a range of harmful pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter, which can be especially damaging to developing lungs. Fine particulates, smaller than 1 micron in diameter, can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, increasing the risks of asthma, reduced lung function, and even lung cancer. The switch to electric buses eliminates these emissions entirely, representing a significant step forward for children’s health and air quality in local communities.\n“Diesel-fueled vehicles emit toxic particles into our communities causing air pollution which directly impacts our children developmentally before they are even born,” said First Lady Tammy Murphy . “These grants for zero-emission buses are investments in the health and safety of our mothers, babies and families.”\n“Children, whose lungs are still developing, are most vulnerable to the harmful health effects of poor air quality, yet millions of them are transported to and from school every day in buses that release harmful diesel emissions,” said Commissioner LaTourette . “It is critical that our school buses be equipped with the latest technology to protect them.”\nIn the past, the DEP has focused on retrofitting diesel-powered buses with improved ventilation to protect students from harmful fumes. However, this shift to electric buses is intended to further protect students by removing harmful emissions altogether, thereby contributing to New Jersey’s climate and public health goals.\n“The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is proud to support the DEP’s ground-breaking Electric School Bus Program, which advances the Murphy Administration’s efforts to make clean transportation more accessible across the Garden State,” said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy . “For decades to come, these awards will help improve air quality and public health among our most vulnerable neighbors, including children and residents in overburdened communities.”\nElectric School Bus Grant Program was authorized by legislation signed by Governor Phil Murphy in 2022. Photo by Morristown Minute Statewide Grant Recipients Announced The $15 million grant will fund electric school bus purchases and charging infrastructure in districts across New Jersey, with a focus on reducing emissions in overburdened communities. Recipients include:\nBeloved Charter School : $1.28 million for four buses and four fast charging stations. Berkeley Heights : $580,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Christina Seix Academy : $640,000 for two buses and two level two charging stations. Egg Harbor Township : $640,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Garfield Public School District : $640,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Haddonfield School District : $580,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Hudson County School District : $1.6 million for five buses and five fast charging stations. Jackson School District : $1.86 million for six buses, three level two charging stations, and three fast charging stations. Lakewood School District : $1.56 million for five buses, two level two charging stations, and three fast charging stations. Pleasantville : $640,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Princeton Public School District : $620,000 for two buses, one level two charging station, and one fast charging station. Readington Township Public Schools : $640,000 for two buses and two fast charging stations. Summit Public Schools : $1.28 million for four buses and four fast charging stations. United Academy of Union : $2.5 million for eight buses, three level two charging stations, and five fast charging stations. Introducing the New Jersey Fleet Advisor Program In addition to funding electric school buses, Commissioner LaTourette also announced the launch of the New Jersey Fleet Advisor program , a free service developed in partnership with CALSTART, a nonprofit organization. The program provides expert technical assistance to help smaller fleets, such as school districts, emergency medical squads, and municipal utilities, plan the transition to zero-emission vehicles. The program aims to fill knowledge gaps regarding electric vehicles, from infrastructure needs to cost projections, and will help participants engage with manufacturers and permitting authorities.\n“CALSTART is thrilled to partner with NJDEP to bring personalized fleet assistance to small fleets in New Jersey,” said Jennifer Kritzler, Regional Deputy Director, Northeast, CALSTART. “We truly believe that working one-on-one is the best way to meet fleets’ needs as they begin to think about what the zero-emission vehicle transition means for them.”\nFifteen New Jersey fleets have been selected for the first round of technical assistance, including: Charged Up Electric (Mountainside): Electrical service vehicles. Lakeland Emergency Squad (Byram Township): EMS vehicles. Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority (Wharton): Municipal service vehicles. Prudential (Newark): Employee shuttles. City of New Brunswick – Division of Sanitation Inspections (New Brunswick): Municipal service vehicles. Rachles/Michele’s Oil Co. Inc. (Clifton): Fuel delivery vehicles. Alliance Transportation LLC (New Brunswick): Passenger vans and shuttle buses. Creative Staging Associates (Pennsauken): Local delivery vehicles. Sussexpress LLC (Sparta): Passenger vans and shuttle buses. Supreme Green Team (East Brunswick): Cargo vans. Atlantic County Utilities Authority (Vineland): Heavy-duty trucks. Passaic County Paratransit (Passaic County): Paratransit vehicles. Borough of Bay Head (Bay Head): Public works vehicles. The New Jersey Fleet Advisor program will continue accepting applications for technical assistance until spaces are filled, offering further opportunities for fleets across the state to plan for electrification.\nTransportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey, contributing 37 percent of all emissions. Of the 21,700 school buses registered statewide, over 99 percent still run on fossil fuels. By providing comprehensive support for transitioning to electric buses, the state aims to reduce emissions, promote cleaner air, and protect public health, particularly in overburdened communities.\nThe state’s first steps toward a cleaner transportation system mark an important milestone in its ongoing fight against climate change and pollution.\nFor updates, subscribe to our free newsletter!
