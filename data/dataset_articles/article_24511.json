  "text": "( MENAFN - GetNews) We all have a role to play. By supporting policies that promote sustainability, investing in green technologies, and educating ourselves about the benefits, we can drive real change, we can build a future that's both prosperous and sustainable.\nNitin Bhatnagar, a leading figure in the Dubai Real estate market, is calling for an industry-wide shift towards sustainable development practices. With over 20 years of experience in real estate, Bhatnagar believes that integrating sustainability into building projects is not only a responsibility but a necessity for the future of the industry.\n“Real estate accounts for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions, and if we don't act now, we risk causing irreparable damage to our environment,” Bhatnagar emphasizes.“Sustainable development isn't just an option-it's a mandate for creating a healthier, more resilient future.”\nAccording to a 2023 report from the World Green Building Council, buildings are responsible for 36% of energy use and 39% of carbon emissions worldwide. This underscores the urgency of adopting energy-efficient technologies and green building materials. Bhatnagar's projects have successfully reduced energy consumption by up to 30% through the integration of smart HVAC systems, solar panels, and energy-efficient lighting.\n“Sustainable practices are not just environmentally responsible-they're economically beneficial in the long run,” Bhatnagar adds.“Green buildings have 20% lower operating costs on average, and properties with sustainable features see a 10% increase in asset value.”\nBhatnagar calls on fellow developers, policymakers, and consumers to advocate for more sustainable practices in real estate. He urges governments to offer incentives for green building initiatives and encourages consumers to prioritize eco-friendly developments when making investment decisions.“We all have a role to play. By supporting policies that promote sustainability, investing in green technologies, and educating ourselves about the benefits, we can drive real change,” he states.\nLooking ahead, Bhatnagar is excited about the potential impact of advancements in green building materials and smart technologies. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration across industries to develop innovative solutions that reduce the ecological footprint of real estate.“We're at the brink of a new era in urban development, and it's up to us to lead the way,” he says.“Together, we can build a future that's both prosperous and sustainable.”\nNitin Bhatnagar's advocacy for sustainability serves as a rallying call for industry leaders, stakeholders, and consumers to take action. By championing sustainable development, he is setting an example of how the real estate industry can evolve to meet the challenges of today while securing a greener future for generations to come.\nMENAFN03102024003238003268ID1108745433",
