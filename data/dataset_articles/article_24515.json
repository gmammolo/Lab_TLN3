  "text": "About\nAt Berry Harvest, we’re all about bringing you delicious and nutritious acai bowls that support both your health and the environment. Our acai berries are carefully sourced from local farmers in Brazil, right from the heart of the Amazon. By partnering directly with these farmers, we ensure that every berry in your bowl is not only packed with natural goodness but is also sustainably harvested, supporting local communities along the way.\nAs part of Brite Harvest, a company dedicated to quality and sustainability, we take pride in managing the entire process—from sourcing the berries to creating our blends. Our acai is harvested fresh from Amazonian acai palm trees, preserving their authentic flavor and rich nutrients. Whether you’re enjoying one of our bowls on the go or relaxing at home, you can feel good knowing that every bite is rooted in mindful sourcing and community support.\nSolution\nOur packaging and branding are designed to reflect the vibrant and natural essence of Berry Harvest. We’ve created a logo that draws inspiration from the shape of a berry, with the letter “B” at its heart. This symbol is simple yet meaningful, representing both the freshness of our ingredients and our connection to nature.\nWe’ve used a colorful theme across our packaging to capture the energy and variety of flavors that come from our Brazilian-sourced acai. The look is bright and inviting, giving you a sense of the fun and healthy experience that comes with each bowl. Whether it’s on the shelf or in your hands, our packaging stands out with its playful yet down-to-earth design, reflecting what Berry Harvest is all about—fresh, wholesome, and real.\nResults\nThe result is a brand that feels fresh, approachable, and true to its roots. Our vibrant packaging, paired with the berry-inspired “B” logo, makes Berry Harvest stand out while staying grounded in what matters most: delivering wholesome, delicious acai bowls. The design reflects the natural, colorful ingredients inside, making it easy for people to connect with the product.\nUltimately, our branding and packaging come together to create an inviting experience that reflects the quality and care behind each bowl, giving customers something they can enjoy and feel good about.",
