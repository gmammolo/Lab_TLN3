  "text": "What a great weekend we had! The [Global Bird Weekend](https://globalbirding.org/home), which took place on October 9-10, 2021, was a full success. [October Big Day](https://ebird.org/octoberbigday) was joined by nearly 33,000 birders from 195 countries who submitted more than 78,024 checklists and recorded over 7,269 bird species. Incredibly, this is quite likely the record number of bird species ever observed on a single day! This year’s global team consisted of more than 800 eBirders in Africa, 2,000 in Asia, 2,500 in Europe, and 5,300 in Central and South America. These tremendous efforts showcase the power of birds to bring people together. SWAROVSKI OPTIK Team We are proud to report that our [SWAROVSKI OPTIK team](https://ebird.org/profile/MTg1NjE1NQ/world) did a fantastic job, with 2,116 species recorded and 447 submitted checklists. In the teams ranking, we took first place when it comes to the number of different species observed. How awesome is that? EXCELLENT job, everyone! Thank you for your valuable contributions! We are already looking forward to next year's Global Big Day in May and the Global Bird Weekend in October and can't wait to have you on board with us again.
