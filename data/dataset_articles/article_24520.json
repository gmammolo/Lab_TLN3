  "text": "In the 12 months to 30 June 2024, 61 people drowned at beaches, coastal waterways and the ocean according to Surf Life Saving NSW data. The Multicultural Water Safety Day aims to empower multicultural communities in the Illawarra with the skills and confidence to safely enjoy local waters. The initiative is a collaboration between the NSW Office of Sport, Illawarra Multicultural Services, Multicultural Communities Council Illawarra, Surf Life Saving NSW, Royal Life Saving, University of Wollongong, and other local stakeholders designed to educate multicultural communities on vital water safety skills and knowledge, particularly the beach, inland water and rock fishing safety. As well as interactive educational sessions including a live rip dye and resuscitation demonstrations, there will be hands-on practical activities and the opportunity to engage with facilitators and local organisations. The event will be held at Wollongong City Beach from 10am on Friday, 11 October. Minster for the Illawarra and the South Coast, Ryan Park, said: \"The Illawarra and South Coast is home to some of the best beaches in the State and the NSW Government is committed to making sure that all members of our community can enjoy them safely. \"With a focus on inclusivity and community engagement, this initiative aims to make a lasting impact on the water safety in the region.\" \"We hope that this event is the first step in instilling a lifelong understanding and appreciation of water safety among our multicultural communities.\" Minister for Sport, Steve Kamper, said: \"Swimming and being on or near the water is a key part of the Australian lifestyle, but too many people, particularly those from multicultural backgrounds, continue to lose their lives to drowning.\" \"The NSW Government wants to ensure that people participating in water activities or just enjoying a swim at the beach have the skills and knowledge to do so safely.\" Member for Wollongong, Paul Scully, said: \"Wollongong is a diverse community and events such as these allow us to provide targeted resources to our multicultural residents, particularly those who may not have grown up around the water. \"Many newer residents and visiting students have little or no experience in the surf, it's important they gave a good understand of water safety. \"I encourage as many members of our community as possible to come down, participate and learn potentially life-saving lessons.\" Projects Coordinator for Illawarra Multicultural Services, Amro Zoabe said: \"Working with multicultural communities, IMS understands the importance of having vital information available in language. By having our multilingual community workers provide language support for this event, we ensure everyone has equitable access. \"We are lucky to be living on Dharawal land on waters. This event helps make sure our multicultural communities, access these waters safely.\" [here](/wollongong-to-host-multicultural-water-safety-1330608/).",
