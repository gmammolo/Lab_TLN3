  "text": "Odisha has recorded presence of rare melanistic leopard, popularly known as black panther, in three forest divisions as it released findings of the first All Odisha Leopard Estimation-2024 results conducted across 47 forest divisions across the state. So far, Odisha’s Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) is known as the country's only habitat that has the melanistic Royal Bengal tigers (RBT). The big cats of Similipal represent a unique lineage since they have black as well as yellow stripes interspersed on their bodies. \"During the leopard estimation, we have found the presence of black panthers in three forest divisions of the state in western and central Odisha. Since the black panther is a rare species, we are not revealing where they have been spotted as there are chances of poachers targeting them,\" said a senior official from the forest department. Poaching of leopards is a major concern. According to data available with the state forest department, as many as 59 leopard skins were seized from smugglers in Odisha between 2018 and 2023. According to the census report, Odisha is home to total 696 leopards, an increase of 128 than the numbers mentioned in a report published by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The recent numbers are, however, less than what was found in the NTCA survey in 2018, when the number was estimated at 760. \"The NTCA used only camera traps in limited places to count leopards in Odisha. Instead of a detailed survey, they only use a statistical model to estimate the numbers. In 2018, NTCA’s statistical error was 35%, which was 33% in 2012. Our statistical error is less than 10%,” said Susanta Nanda, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Odisha. Unlike the NTCA survey, Odisha forest department used various identifiers to detect leopard presence such as pugmarks, scrapes, scats, rakes, urine spray, vocalizations and livestock depredation. \"Sites with confirmed direct or indirect evidence of leopard were monitored using camera traps to estimate the minimum number of unique adult leopards based on their distinctive rosette patterns,” said the survey results. Besides being home to the highest number of RBTs, the Similipal Tiger Reserve, spreading over 2,750 square km, also has the largest leopard population in Odisha. The Satkosia landscape turned out to be another promising site for leopards, and boasts the second highest leopard population in the state.",
