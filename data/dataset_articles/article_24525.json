  "text": "The Transport and Logistics Bureau said on Thursday that it is streamlining procedures to expedite three smart green public transport system projects, possibly shortening the tendering process by 12 months. On its social media page, the bureau said it is exploring possibilities to compress the timeline for planning, design and construction for projects in East Kowloon, Kai Tak and Hung Shui Kiu. It is aiming to award the construction contract for the Kai Tak project by 2026. \"Regarding the Kai Tak project, we will adopt an innovative process allowing certain statutory procedures to go ahead while the project is still in final design stage and aiming to invite tenders a year earlier than originally scheduled,\" the social media post said. It also said the bureau is striving to have the other two projects open for tender in 2026. The bureau said it would issue an invitation for expressions of interest for the Hung Shui Kiu project by the end of this year and it has already asked local and international system suppliers and operators to submit expressions of interest for the East Kowloon and Kai Tak projects, to gather market feedback. \"We will continue to fully promote these three projects, striving for their completion as soon as possible to provide the community with more convenient and diverse travel options,\" the bureau added.",
