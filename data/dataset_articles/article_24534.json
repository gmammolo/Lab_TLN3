  "text": "The University of Queensland's plant sciences department will receive a shot in the arm with the opening of a state of the art $65 million facility. The Plant Futures Facility, opened today, has a number of features to allow researchers to best replicate desired conditions, such as temperature control and the ability to adjust light intensity, light quality, humidity and CO 2 concentration. The new functions will allow researchers to best replicate conditions that might be found under climate change. UQ vice chancellor Deborah Terry said the building, which she described as unique in the southern hemisphere, would be a boost not only for UQ but for Australia's plant breeding sector. \"This facility is an important national asset and reinforces the position of Australia, Queensland and UQ as a leader in plant science research,\" Professor Terry said. She said one of the major aims with new building was to give researchers the ability to replicate climate change scenarios. \"Being able to accurately control every aspect of the growing environment opens up opportunities for precision plant science and to fast track experiments,\" she said. \"This is crucial to supporting Australian farmers and producers as they respond the challenges of a changing climate.\" The opening of the facility, located at the university's main campus in St Lucia in inner city Brisbane represents the culmination of three years of construction work. Every step of the growth process will be monitored, with cameras and sensors capturing data as the plants grow. There are nine rooftop glasshouses for propagation, four for temperate plants and five for tropical plants and three floors of grow rooms, glasshouses and laboratories along with two levels of mechanical and computer equipment. Director of the UQ-led ARC Centre for Plant Success in Nature and Agriculture, Christine Beveridge, said experiments in the facility will expand knowledge about the relationship between a plant's genome and the environment which in turn could lead to breeding breakthroughs to create tougher and higher yielding plants. \"We are still discovering fundamental things about how plants work - what makes them flower, branch or have big, small or thick leaves,\" Professor Beveridge said. \"We can now expose the same genetic material to slightly different temperatures or to lighting that simulates different day lengths to see how it responds while keeping everything else about the environment the same. \"This level of control was not possible before the construction of this specialised building and the technology it contains.\"",
