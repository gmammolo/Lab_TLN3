  "text": "Climate funding for fuel cells, home resiliency, education and other PEI projects Islanders are working on 16 new and innovative projects as we deal with climate change, thanks to PEI’s climate challenge fund, and government is now calling for new applications. The goal of the Climate Challenge Fund is to empower people of different backgrounds, experiences, and expertise, who work across sectors and in different communities throughout the Island, to contribute to climate action in any or all of the following areas - adapting to projected impacts of climate change; - reducing greenhouse gas emissions; - increasing opportunities for carbon sequestration (the removal and storage of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere); - building capacity and resilience through public outreach and education; and/or - expanding climate change research and knowledge. For this year, the fund has been increased by over $450,000 with the support of the Climate Action and Awareness Fund, through the Government of Canada’s Environmental Damages Fund. Together with the province’s support, this year’s Climate Challenge Fund supports research, educational materials and bringing new clean technologies to market. Since 2020, the [Climate Challenge Fund ](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/apply-to-the-pei-climate-challenge-fund)has provided $1 million annually to help organizations develop solutions to address climate change. The Fund has supported 76 projects to date across sectors and organization types, including First Nations, municipalities, nonprofit organizations, local businesses and academic institutions in Prince Edward Island. Interested groups can [apply online](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/service/apply-to-the-pei-climate-challenge-fund) for the next round of funding. Quotes: “Our government is steadfast in responding to climate change with Island ingenuity and the best scientific research. Our community partners are on the ground developing solutions to face climate change in Prince Edward Island and we are proud to support them in this important work for our future.” - Hon. Steven Myers, Minister of Environment, Energy and Climate Action, Government of Prince Edward Island. “Each of us has a role to play in reducing our footprint by switching to more energy-efficient and low-carbon solutions that cut polluting emissions and save money. By investing in local solutions, we are building a cleaner, more resilient economy for generations to come.” - The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada Supporting community-based climate action is one priority of the Government of Canada’s [Environmental Damages Fund’s](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-funding/programs/environmental-damages-fund.html) [Climate Action and Awareness Fund](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/funding-programs/climate-action-awareness-fund.html). Projects funded under this priority aim to develop knowledge, tools, and/or skills that engage communities in climate action in order to help support Canada’s climate goals, including net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Environmental Damages Fund is administered by Environment and Climate Change Canada.
