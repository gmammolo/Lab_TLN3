  "text": "[Community Corner](/new-york/yorktown-somers/around-town) Yorktown Puts Finishing Coat On New Paint Recycling Program The recycling program is a collaboration with PaintCare, a nonprofit organization established by the American Coatings Association. YORKTOWN, NY — The Town of Yorktown launched a new paint recycling initiative last Friday. Residents are now able to recycle household paints, primers, stains, sealers, and clear coatings such as shellac and varnish. Accepted products include interior and exterior architectural paints such as latex, acrylic, oil-based, and enamel. All products must be in their original containers (no larger than 5 gallons), with the manufacturer’s label intact and lids secured. \"Our new paint recycling program is a vital step toward protecting our environment, our children, and our pets from the harmful effects of improper disposal,\" Supervisor Ed Lachterman said. \"By safely recycling leftover paint, we’re reducing toxic waste in our community, keeping hazardous materials out of landfills, and preserving Yorktown’s natural beauty for future generations.\" Find out what's happening in Yorktown-Somerswith free, real-time updates from Patch.
