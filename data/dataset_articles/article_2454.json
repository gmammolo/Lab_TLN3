  "text": "An apologetic thief ripped off $10,000 from one Manhattan bank, but was thwarted at a second, and then busted, police said Wednesday.\nElisha Gerald Roger, 22, walked into a Tribeca Citibank branch on West Broadway near Duane St. just before 1:20 p.m. Tuesday and handed a teller a one-page note, handwritten with no punctuation.\n“Hello,” the note read, according to police. “Sorry to bother you I need $10,000 cash right now All hundreds No die [sic] money Yes this is a robbery”\nBy “no die,” the robber was referring to exploding dye packs tellers can slip in with a bank robber’s haul.\nThe teller complied, police said, and Roger fled with a cash-stuffed envelope.\nAbout 20 minutes later, Roger walked into a Chase bank on Broadway near Murray St., across from City Hall, with the same note. He left emptyhanded, though, and was nabbed by cops a short time later at West Broadway and Franklin St.\nThe money from the successful robbery was recovered, police said.\nNo one was injured in either incident. However, the suspect’s note did vow to hurt anyone who tipped off the police, according to cops.\nRoger, who lives in the Bronx, was charged with robbery. Police said he has 11 prior arrests, most recently for drug possession last May.",
