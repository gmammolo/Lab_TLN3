  "text": "The near future is full of daunting challenges when it comes to aging, traffic, and rising temperatures.\nBy 2050, 88 million Americans will be age 65 or older. Because of congestion and a lack of infrastructure, Californians could spend twice the time they currently do stuck in traffic.\nAnd global temperatures are expected to jump nearly three degrees Fahrenheit. But a high-tech solution is seeking to blunt these impacts and provide a more sustainable path forward.\nYou won't find the testing grounds in Silicon Valley or in the trendy shared workspaces in San Francisco's SoMa. Instead, you'll find the revolutionary approach to public transportation on the road at Rossmoor in Walnut Creek .\n\"This is the perfect place to test this technology. This is a private gated community. Stop signs It's a simple roadway,\" explained Executive Director of the Contra Costa Transportation Authority Tim Haile.\nHaile is responsible for all the planning, funding, and delivery for the Measure J program . In 2004, Contra Costa voters approved Measure J, which will raise about $2.7 billion through a sales tax, with the funds dedicated for transportation programs in the county.\nThe technology that Haile referred to is a driverless, electric-powered, low-speed shuttle called PRESTO . The automated shuttle system made its debut last month .\nThe Rossmoor project is a one-year pilot program that will be provided free to residents. The CCTA launched its first autonomous shuttle service at Bishop Ranch .\nThis is the second service done in conjunction with Beep . A third launch will happen in Martinez.\nBeep, which is headquartered in Florida, is a leading provider of what's known as autonomous shared mobility services. These services utilize driverless, electric, multi-passenger vehicles. Their goal is to reduce congestion with a sustainable, more climate-friendly approach.\nCBS News Bay Area met up with some members of the Rossmoor Sustainability Club and asked what they thought about the pilot program.\n\"I think it's a great idea,\" said Adrian Bryam.\n\"For the sake of the planet, there needs to be broad adoption of both EV and ultimately public transportation. And I think there's a place for autonomous vehicles as well,\" added Timothy Cowan.\nSeated nearby was realtor Jackie Giffin. She had some questions.\n\"I think it's a wonderful experiment, but as I watch them, you know, it just brought so many questions to mind: How is it really operating? What do people do when they get on? Do they tell somebody where they're going to go?\" Griffin asked.\nJohn Moe said he thinks the shuttles are going to be safer and more efficient.\n\"I mean, the way that we do things now with everybody having their own vehicles, it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense,\" concluded Moe.\nHaile told CBS News Bay Area that since Contra Costa County is in the suburbs, that they expect more congestion and that they can't build their way out of the problem. That is why the county is looking at alternate ways and modes to move people, reduce congestion and fossil fuel use, and maintain independence and quality of life for seniors, vets, and the disabled. And Rossmoor offers a lot to gather data as the shuttles seek to benefit the community.\n\"It's a great place to see how this technology can give the people here at Rossmoor the independence and quality of life that they deserve as they continue to age and get older,\" commented Haile.\nOn board the shuttle is a trained attendant. Each vehicle holds up to seven passengers in addition to the attendant.\nFor now, the shuttle runs on a pre-programmed loop from the clubhouse to the fitness center, but only on weekdays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nThis group would love to see the hours extended and for the shuttles to be operating on the weekends.\n\"Having some form of wheels is very important,\" said Byram. He said the way Rossmoor is laid out, you can't walk to the store, or to a medical appointment.\n\"Some people hold onto their cars longer than they should and if there is a really good alternative, that makes all the sense in the world,\" he added.\nAll of the residents with whom we spoke were enthusiastic about the technology. Not a single one expressed concern over its safety.\n\"Let's face it, this vehicle can see all the way around it. It's got six eyes. I've got two,\" said Byram.\n\"If the technology is there to get people where they're going without having a driver, I think that's fabulous. And environmentally, it means, it can't be beat,\" said Giffin.\nNeither Giffin nor Moe had tried the shuttle until now. They climbed onboard at the designated stop, put on their seat belts, and the door closed. The round trip took about 15 minutes. At one point the shuttle detected an obstacle and stopped. The obstacle was a low-hanging branch that is scheduled to get pruned back.\nWhen the shuttle returned to the community center, some praise, and some feedback.\n\"I thought it might be slow, but it felt like it was moving right along,\" remarked Moe.\n\"It was hot and noisy, and I felt like in the back window they needed to have sunscreen built in,\" noted Giffin. Though overall, she said she liked the ride.\nHaile said passenger feedback will shape the future of the technology. The hope is to move beyond fixed routes and offer on demand public transportation. Imagine, he mused, an EV autonomous public transportation system that picks you up on demand, collecting people in neighborhoods, residences, businesses, and downtown areas.\n\"Getting them to where they want to go, when they want to go, and how they get there, and how they want to get there. Our PRESTO shuttle is all about your ride, your way,\" explained Haile.\nThe pilot program is funded by a grant from the U.S Department of Transportation. The Contra Costa Transit Authority was the only local agency out of the eight recipients of the federal grants.\nThe hope is to ultimately move beyond fixed routes and offer on demand rides, paving the future of transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nMore from CBS News How to slash Halloween's bone-chilling volume of plastic waste 5 people displaced in overnight house fire in San Francisco's Noe Valley Valero refinery in Benicia fined record $82M for history of toxic releases Striking hotel workers in San Francisco arrested after blocking street San Mateo County officials say home insurance crisis warrants state of emergency In: Project Earth Walnut Creek Elizabeth Cook Less than a month after arriving at KPIX 5 as the 5pm co-anchor and night-side reporter, Elizabeth Cook was in San Francisco's Mission District covering a chaotic Occupy march when a protester shoved her and her cameraman.
