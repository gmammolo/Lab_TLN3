  "text": "Thousands of children can help their families 'Beat the Bite' with the statewide distribution of books that help teach the importance of mosquito bite prevention. 'Jack & Angie - Beat the Bite' is an entertaining story about two youngsters who love playing in and exploring the great outdoors while staying safe from mosquito bites. More than 77,000 books have been printed and are being delivered to schools, early childhood and education centres and local councils across NSW, with 430 public and independent schools, 103 early childhood and education centres, 66 councils already having opted in to receive books. Other services such as Aboriginal health and immunisation services, scouts and guides across NSW have also ordered books. The statewide distribution is an expansion of a popular Murrumbidgee Local Health District (MLHD) initiative which saw more than 43,000 books distributed across Murrumbidgee, Southern and Western NSW. Mosquitoes can transmit diseases that are spread to humans through mosquito bites. In NSW they can carry viruses such as Japanese encephalitis (JE), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), Ross River, and Barmah Forest virus. These viruses may cause symptoms ranging from tiredness, rash, headache, and sore and swollen joints to rare but severe symptoms of seizures and loss of consciousness. Protective measures to avoid bites, include: - wear light, loose-fitting long-sleeved shirts, long pants and covered footwear and socks - avoid being outdoors at dawn and dusk - apply repellent to all areas of exposed skin, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus which are the most effective against mosquitoes - reapply repellent regularly, particularly after swimming. Always apply sunscreen first and then apply repellent - use insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units and mosquito coils to repel mosquitos. Mosquito coils should only be used outside. A vaccine is available to protect against Japanese encephalitis virus, which is available for free to those at greatest risk of exposure. For more information on eligibility visit [Japanese encephalitis vaccination](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/jev/Pages/vaccination.aspx) [here](/nsws-beat-bite-shields-kids-from-mosquitoes-1330622/).",
