In this case, necessary measures will be taken so that there is no disruption in their way of life.\nHe said these things in the speech of the chief guest of the workshop titled ‘What to do for the development of indigenous fish resources in Haor region’ in the conference room of the Department of Fisheries on Tuesday (October 1) afternoon.\nThe advisor said, no such prohibited nets can be used in Howar, which kills the fish. Howre expressed his opinion to work together with the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure that toxic chemicals or pesticides are not used in rice fields. In this regard, he urged the Department of Fisheries to strictly enforce the law.\nRegarding the lease of the Haor area in the workshop, he said that even if the land ministry gives the lease, the conditions of the lease should be strictly enforced to save Haor. If necessary, work should be done to protect the natural environment, preserve biodiversity and improve people’s quality of life in Haor region by planting trees.\nDirector General of the Department of Fisheries.
