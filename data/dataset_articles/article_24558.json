HERE IS THIS WEEK'S FALL FOLIAGE REPORT. WE ARE OFFICIALLY NEAR OR AT PEAK CONDITIONS ACROSS THE GREAT NORTH WOODS AND INTO THE WHITE MOUNTAINS. ACROSS THE REST OF THE STATE THE COLOR IS REALLY RAMPING UP AND LOOKING BEAUTIFUL. BERLIN IS NEAR OR AT PEAK... PLYMOUTH IS CLOSE BUT STILL IN MODERATE COLOR... AND THE MORE TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST YOU GO LESS COLOR. HERE'S A BEAUTIFUL SHOT FROM BRETTON WOODS... LOOK AT ALL THAT COLOR, ESPECIALLY ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDES. LOTS OF YELLOWS AND REDS. FIREY REDS AND GOLDEN YELLOW ON THIS CAMERA IN BARTLETT. AND IN THE MONADNOCK REGION... HERE WE SEE MOUNT MONADNOCK... IT PROBABLY CLOSER TO 50 % COLOR NOW. THIS WEEK'S REPORT SHOWS AT OR NEAR PEAK FROM THE WHITE MOUNTAINS AND NORTH. WE'RE HEARING THAT AREAS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE WHITES ARE SLIGHTLY BEHIND... SO MORE MODERATE COLOR THROUGH THE MOUNT WASHINGTON VALLEY... BUT PEAK ISN'T FAR AWAY. MODERATE COLOR FROM PLYMOUTH THROUGH THE LAKES REGION AND SOUTH INTO THE MERRIMACK VALLEY. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A DRIVE UP NORTH WE'RE HEARING THE DRIVE FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE'S MORE NORTHERN COMMUNITY PITTSBURG TO COLEBROOK ALONG ROUTE 3 IS STUNNING. WE HEAR THE KANK HAS TAKEN ON SLIGHTLY MORE COLOR, AND YOU'LL SEE THE BEST FOLIAGE FROM OVERLOOKS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE DRIVE. THE WEEKEND'S WEATHER FORECAST LOOKS FABULOUS FOR FOLIAGE VIEWING. AFTER SOME EARLY SHOWERS ON SATURDAY ESPECIALLY UP NORTH, THE SUN BREAKS OUT. SUNDAY WILL BE SUNNY.. COOLER.. AND BREEZY. THERE'S MUCH MORE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE WMUR.COM AND OUR APP SO BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE FOLIAGE SECTION FO Advertisement New Hampshire foliage map: Colors near or at peak in the northern region Meteorologist Hayley LaPoint explains when you can expect the leaves to reach peak foliage across New Hampshire.
