  "text": "Northern lights could be visible across Wisconsin tonight and Friday night Some lucky Wisconsinites [may be able to see the northern lights](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/02/northern-lights-states-forecast/75488656007/) Thursday and Friday nights, according to the [NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.spaceweather.gov/?fbclid=IwY2xjawFhASJleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHaGxwLLAn2euQ_pG-n9XHkolkYfREyloUC-6-X8RgOe1IJQ1hz-SlVDfrA_aem_G96Qvayk5IZkILLoJkIETw). The northern lights could be visible in some areas of the U.S., including parts of Wisconsin, [following two observed coronal mass ejections](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047) Tuesday, including [the massive X7.1 solar flare](https://x.com/NWSSWPC/status/1841524465143841047), according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. The center [issued geomagnetic storm watches](https://www.spaceweather.gov/news/g1-g3-minor-strong-geomagnetic-storm-watches-issued-03-05-october#:~:text=G1-G3%20(Minor-Strong)%20Geomagnetic%20Storm%20Watches%20have%20been%20issued%20for%2003-05) for the rest of the week, forecasting that the northern lights will be present in the night sky. In May, a [powerful geomagnetic storm](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/severe-solar-storm-2024/73642315007/) unleashed [spectacular views of the northern lights](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/11/aurora-borealis-photos-northern-lights-seen-us-europe/73652013007/) in areas of the U.S. where auroras are seldom visible, [including here in Milwaukee](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/2024/05/11/northern-lights-seen-in-milwaukee-wisconsin-last-night/73653382007/). As the [sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/01/northern-lights-solar-maximum-auroras/75449249007/) in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity. Where can I see the northern lights in Wisconsin? [According to the NOAA](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-viewline-tonight-and-tomorrow-night-experimental#:~:text=Tomorrow%20Night's%20Aurora%20Viewline.%20This%20is%20a%20prediction%20of%20the), the northern lights could be visible in northern Wisconsin and perhaps as far south as southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois Thursday night and into the weekend. The northern lights are expected to be visible in multiple northern U.S. states Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. Sightings are forecasted along the U.S.-Canada border, but also as far south as Oregon to Pennsylvania, according to the center. The best time to view the auroras will be Friday from around midnight into the early hours of Saturday. Outside variables, such as weather and the precise trajectory of the solar eruption, which can change during its 93-million-mile journey to Earth, could affect the reliability of the forecast. To monitor the aurora forecast, you can use the [NOAA aurora forecast tool](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast), which has a 30-minute forecast window. There's also a tool on the Milwaukee Astronomical Society website at [milwaukeeastro.org](https://milwaukeeastro.org/obsInfo/solarActivity.asp#loaded). On the tool, you'll see the northern lights prediction for 35 minutes ahead. You'll have good odds of seeing the northern lights if the color over Wisconsin is yellow, orange or even red. What causes the northern lights? Also known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are [a natural light display in Earth's sky](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/10/northern-lights-aurora-when-time/73638964007/) that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with [molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/05/18/northern-lights-colors-explained/73731506007/), causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the [University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) website, which tracks the phenomenon. As auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time. When northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. Best places in Wisconsin to see the northern lights Here's a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky: [Newport State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/newport), Ellison Bay [Driftless Region, Wisconsin](https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2022/06/28/driftless-region-wisconsin-vernon-county-wants-become-international-dark-sky-park-kickapoo-valley/7487767001/) [Harrington Beach State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/harringtonbeach), Belgium [Kettle Moraine State Forest](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kms), Eagle [Kohler-Andrae State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kohlerandrae), Sheboygan [Parnell Tower](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/kmn/recreation/hiking), Plymouth Journal Sentinel reporter Alex Groth contributed to this report.",
