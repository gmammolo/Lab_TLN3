  "text": "Garbage management reduces pollution by 26% in key areas: IIT Delhi Study A study by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi focused on highly polluted areas—Jahangirpuri, Rohini, and Karol Bagh—in the national capital for over eight months, suggests better garbage management and reduction of pollutant would help in reducing pollution. In Short - IIT Delhi's study focused on pollution in Jahangirpuri, Rohini, and Karol Bagh - Jahangirpuri saw 26.6% PM2.5 reduction after road and footpath repairs addressed - The study supports replicating similar initiatives in other polluted cities A recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D) has highlighted the effectiveness of the Air Pollution Action Group’s initiative aimed at reducing pollution from sources such as garbage burning and dust in urban areas of Delhi. The study focused on three major pollution hotspots—Jahangirpuri, Rohini, and Karol Bagh—over an eight-month period, using portable low-cost sensors (PLCS) alongside regulatory-grade Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS). Key findings showed a significant reduction in PM2.5—a critical pollutant with severe health implications— after long-term infrastructural issues, like road and footpath repairs, were addressed. Jahangirpuri saw the largest reduction at 26.6 per cent, followed by Rohini with a 15.7 per cent drop, and Karol Bagh with a 15.3 per cent decrease. These results indicate the potential for hyperlocal interventions to improve air quality. The study advocates replicating such initiatives in other cities facing similar air quality challenges, as part of the National Clean Air Action Plan. Led by Professor Sagnik Dey of IIT-D's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, the study is one of the first to use low-cost sensors in a scientifically rigorous manner to monitor pollution levels. The success of this approach emphasises the importance of both immediate actions, such as garbage management, and long-term infrastructure solutions in enhancing urban air quality. Professor Dey noted the promising results, underscoring the need for data-driven strategies to effectively combat air pollution. The study recommends expanding this approach nationwide, using hybrid monitoring techniques to measure pollution levels accurately and assess the impact of local interventions. This scalable model could provide valuable insights for improving air quality in other regions across the country.",
