  "text": "An Indiana community has come together to rid an area of ecological importance from invasive plant species.\nWith help from AmeriCorps, a U.S. government agency that engages volunteers, the City of Mishawaka is working to remove invasive foxtail grass, thistle , and honeysuckle, among other problematic plants.\nNative plants will replace the invasive species . Native plants are suited to local soil types and weather conditions and help to prevent the future growth of invasives. Sugar maple, red oak, and purple coneflower will be some of the plants that will soon thrive in the area.\nThe mission is to restore the land to help local wildlife set up habitats and pollinate plants, while the addition of some exotic plants will keep pests away .\n\"These are all just woody things, not all of it is invasive, but it is forest, woody shrubs, and so if these establish then they'll become trees, which will knock out the prairie below it, and what we're trying to do here is to establish the prairie, so these prairie species have a place to be,\" AmeriCorps member Emme Thomas told WNDU .\nWhile community efforts like these are vital, creating a better ecosystem and boosting biodiversity doesn't have to be the work of many. In fact, it can happen in your backyard .\nWatch now: Would you wear a shirt made out of oysters? Even a small patch of land dedicated to native plants can make a difference. We all benefit from the birds and insects these garden additions will bring.\nAccording to the U.S. Forest Service , around 80% of the plants used in the food sector and for the production of plant-based industrial products rely on the presence of pollinators .\nIf you need any more convincing to take the native plant path, then consider that they require significantly less maintenance than a standard monoculture lawn. That means no need to get the lawnmower out every couple of weeks. Native plants aren't as thirsty as grass, which means you'll save money on your water bill.\n🗣️ Should we be actively working to kill invasive species? 🔘 Absolutely 💯 🔘 It depends on the species 🤔 🔘 I don't know 🤷 🔘 No — leave nature alone 🙅 🗳️ Click your choice to see results and speak your mind The Mishawaka community knows all about the benefits native plants can bring. It won't be long until the hard work pays off.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",
