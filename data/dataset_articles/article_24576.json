  "text": "Jockey Club donates over HK$121 million to support expansion and enhancement of giant panda habitat at Ocean Park [Local](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news-list/section/local/)| 4 Oct 2024 10:00 am Jockey Club supports enhancement of giant panda habitat at Ocean Park Hong Kong's panda lovers had some joyful news last week as another pair of giant pandas, a gift from the Central Government, arrived to take up residence in our city. To welcome the new arrivals, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has approved over HK$121 million to upgrade habitats within the Giant Panda Adventure and Hong Kong Jockey Club Sichuan Treasures at Ocean Park. The donation will also support the expansion of the Giant Panda Adventure as well as educational programmes for students from underprivileged backgrounds, enabling them to learn more about our natural environment as well as to enjoy the national treasures which are our giant pandas. Club Chairman Michael Lee joined HKSAR Government Chief Secretary for Administration Chan Kwok-ki, Chairman of Ocean Park Corporation Paulo Pong and other guests for the arrival of the giant pandas at Hong Kong International Airport last month. Promoting sustainable development is a strategic priority of the Club’s Charities Trust. The Club supported Ocean Park’s construction and initial operations following its opening in 1977. Since then, the Club has supported community projects organised by Ocean Park, aiming to build awareness of rare animal species, including national treasures like giant pandas. With this latest donation, the Club and its Charities Trust has approved a total of over HK$900 million in donations towards Ocean Park’s development and operations. The Club’s support for Ocean Park, like all its charity and community donations, is made possible by its unique integrated business model through which racing and wagering generate tax contributions, charity support and employment opportunities.",
