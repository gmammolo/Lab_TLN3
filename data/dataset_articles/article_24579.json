  "text": "Tangaroa Blue and Clean Up Australia are joining forces for this year's Great Barrier Reef Clean Up 2024 event. The Great Barrier Reef Clean Up is the largest marine debris collection event across the Reef region. It involves communities, schools and businesses coming together to help protect the Reef from harmful pollution. It is a part of the [ReefClean](https://tangaroablue.org/reefclean/) program. Since 2019, more than 13,310 volunteers have helped ReefClean to remove 127.5 tonnes of marine debris from the Great Barrier Reef region - that is the equivalent of five humpback whales. Marine debris can have serious consequences for the environment, such as: - threatening the biodiversity of the Reef - killing marine life - impacting tourism. Reducing the amount of rubbish entering the Reef is one of the most valuable, tangible actions we can take to protect it. The Great Barrier Reef Clean Up 2024 event is run throughout October and is targeting: - local creeks - rivers - beaches - offshore islands - sand cays. [Join or register a Reef clean up event today](https://tangaroablue.org/get-involved/2024-great-barrier-reef-clean-up/). ReefClean is a program managed by Tangaroa Blue and funded through the Australian Government's Reef Trust. [here](/get-involved-to-help-keep-great-barrier-reef-1330626/).",
