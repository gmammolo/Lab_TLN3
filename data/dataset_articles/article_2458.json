  "text": "I have known the Susman Godfrey firm for a long time and I even argued a motion for summary judgement against Steve Susman a long time ago. Before Steve's death, I used to be one of the few corporate law attorneys invited to the Susman annual party. I got to meet Joe Biden back in 2019 at a fundraiser at Steve's townhome. This is the fundraiser where President Biden and I discussed stuttering, and I got a Biden hug. Susman just filed a motion in the Perkin Coie case and was hit by a trump executive order.\nLink to tweet",
