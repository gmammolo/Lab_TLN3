  "text": "New bike racks and bike repair stations will be installed around Kenai using funds raised by the Kenai River Marathon, after approval Wednesday by the Kenai City Council. An ordinance adopted by the Kenai City Council during their Oct. 2 meeting says that revenue generated by the marathon, which is organized by the Kenai Chamber of Commerce, is managed by the Kenai Community Foundation. That money is used in pursuit of improvements to local recreation, trails, health and wellness. The ordinance accepts a donation of $28,000 for the installation of the racks and repair stations. Kenai Parks and Recreation Director Tyler Best said during the meeting that the addition of bike racks and bike repair stations to places like the Kenai Recreation Center or Kenai’s parks “makes us a bike friendly community.” He said that 15 locations in the city have been identified for installation of a bike rack, with bike repair stations at “the high traffic areas.” Repair stations include a tire pump and a set of tools like wrenches. Best said they allow for quick and easy repairs of flat tires or a detached chain. A bike rack and repair station like those set to be installed around Kenai is already available outside the Kenai Community Library. A memo by Best included with the ordinance says that bike racks and repair stations will be installed at Steve Shearer Memorial Ball Park, Kenai Recreation Center, Kenai Little League Fields, Daubenspeck Family Park, Old Town Park, Kenai Sports Complex, the Kenai Visitor Center and Kenai Municipal Park. Bike racks will be installed at the Kenai Softball Greenstrip, Kenai Bark Park, the Kenai Community Library’s rear entrance, Beaver Creek Park, Cunningham Park, and the Bluff Overlook. The only member of the council to comment on the ordinance on Wednesday was Alex Douthit, who said “I’m happy to see this moving forward. I think it’s going to be great for the community.” The council adopted the ordinance by unanimous vote. A full recording of the meeting is available at “City of Kenai – Public Meetings” on YouTube. The text of the ordinance can be found at kenai.city. Reach reporter Jake Dye at jacob.dye@peninsulaclarion.com.",
