  "text": "Floriade still has a way to go, but don't miss your chance to dig up a part of it, to take home for your own garden, to enjoy next spring.The Great Big Bulb Dig is back.It will be held at Commonwealth Park on Monday, October 14, the day after Floriade closes its gates for 2024.\\u003cbr\\u003eTo participate, you have to buy the 2024 bag - you can't use ones from previous years or bring in random bags.The official 2024 Floriade Art in Bloom Great Big Bulb Dig bags are available during Floriade from the Floriade Shop, the on-site information tent, the Synergy Group Kombi van or the charity marquees.All proceeds from the sale of the bags go to charity - this year Roundabout Canberra and the Indigenous Marathon Foundation.This year sees the return of the $15 bag and there are still plenty to purchase. The more bags you buy, the more bulbs you can take home.But special, bigger VIP bags for $30 were also introduced this year - and they have already sold out. The VIP bag holders also get access to the site at 10am - an hour earlier than the regular bag holders, who will be able to start digging from 11am.Canberra professional services firm Synergy Group is the major sponsor of Floriade again and the brains behind the Great Big Bulb Dig, which is now in its third year.Synergy Group CEO Rob Kennedy loves Floriade, loves spring in Canberra and loves helping local charities.And he's been blown away by the popularity of the Great Big Bulb Dig.The Great Big Bulb Dig has each year raised more than $60,000 for charity. And it is on track to do the same this year, bolstered also by coffee sales from the Synergy Group Kombi, which is on-site in Commonwealth Park during Floriade.\\u003cbr\\u003eThe coffee van is staffed by Synergy staff and volunteers from Roundabout Canberra and the Indigenous Marathon Foundation.\\u003cb\\u003eWHAT: \\u003c/b\\u003eThe Great Big Bulb Dig , Floriade, Commonwealth Park\\u003cb\\u003eWHEN:\\u003c/b\\u003e Monday, October 14. 10am for $30 VIP bag holders (sold out) and 11am for $15 regular bag holders.
