  "text": "THE CITY of Helsinki on Wednesday took an expected step toward banning private cars on Kaivokatu, [reports]Helsingin Sanomat.The Urban Environment Committee of Helsinki showed a green light to dedicating the short street, which connects Mannerheimintie to Mikonkatu, to public transport by a vote of seven for and six against. Helsingin Sanomat on Wednesday reported that the votes fell as expected even though the proposal contained the possibility of a political compromise by including the restoration of lanes on North and South Esplanadi. Representatives of the Christian Democrats, Finns Party and National Coalition, though, argued that the conversion should be carried out only if the downtown service tunnel is opened for through traffic. If the opening were deemed unfeasible, the representatives viewed that one lane in each direction should be preserved on Kaivokatu. The tunnel can be presently used to access underground parking facilities and by delivery vehicles. The Green League, Left Alliance and Social Democrats voted against the counter-proposal, however. Risto Rautava (NCP), the chairperson of the Urban Environment Committee, described the counter-proposal as a gesture of good will. “Restoring lanes on [North and South] Esplanadi is a great and necessary decision. But also another lane would be needed for lateral traffic because Esplanadi gets traffic congestions,” he remarked to Helsingin Sanomat. Cutting off Kaivokatu has been estimated to increase traffic on North Esplanadi by around 30 per cent to roughly a thousand vehicles during the afternoon rush hour, equivalent to the level of 2012, the newspaper wrote. The National Coalition is of the opinion that opening the service tunnel for through traffic should be possible. “Through traffic would help residents in southern parts of the city, especially in terms of traffic in Kruununhaka and Katajanokka, possibly also in Kaivopuisto,” lamented Rautava. Deputy Mayor Anni Sinnemäki (Greens) on Wednesday said it is good that a decision has been made on the direction of traffic development in downtown Helsinki. “The debate on this has ebbed and flowed for years, and things haven’t moved forward. Uncertainty about the future is the biggest hindrance to different stakeholders in the city centre,” she analysed to Helsingin Sanomat. The decision, she added, is one with a far-reaching positive impact on the livelihood and appeal of the city centre. The conversion will be carried out in phases over several years to enable the monitoring of effects on traffic, starting with basic maintenance on the pavement and of Kaivokatu in 2027.",
