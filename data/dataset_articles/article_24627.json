  "text": "Have you ever felt life was moving too fast, making it hard to connect with what truly matters? Romain Pison, an entrepreneur and the founder of Novi Glamping, knows that feeling all too well. Born and raised in the mountains of France, Romain grew up surrounded by nature's purest beauty—long hikes, crisp mountain air, and the serenity of the outdoors were just part of daily life. However, as he moved to urban environments, the connection to nature faded, replaced by the rush of city living.\nThis personal journey is only part of the story. For over a decade, Romain Pison has been deeply involved in sustainable development projects across the globe, from agroforestry initiatives in Africa to carbon offsetting projects in Scotland. His expertise in environmental projects has driven his passion for sustainable tourism, and he has dedicated his career to balancing environmental impact with economic viability. This wealth of experience has directly shaped the vision for Novi Glamping, where ecotourism meets luxury in a way that respects the environment without compromising comfort.\nRomain wasn’t alone in his quest to reconnect with nature. Friends, colleagues, and countless others shared his longing for a peaceful retreat, yet many were reluctant to give up the comforts of modern life. This shared desire inspired him to create Novi Glamping, a company specializing in luxurious and unique glamping experiences that offer a perfect blend of nature and comfort. Novi Glamping provides luxury short-term rentals in beautiful natural settings just outside urban areas, designed to offer a peaceful, off-grid escape with all the modern amenities, without the sense of being isolated or secluded. Each site is carefully chosen to ensure tranquility while remaining connected to the conveniences of nearby towns. Learn more at www.noviglamping.com.\n\"NoviGlamping isn't just about camping; it's about reconnecting with nature and each other,\" says Romain Pison, CEO and Founder of Novi Glamping. \"We wanted to create spaces that bring people closer together, away from screens and schedules, in a setting that’s both natural and luxurious, but never too far from where life happens.\"\nRomain's vision for Novi Glamping emerged from a personal need—he and his wife were searching for ways to reconnect with nature without compromising on the sophisticated comforts they loved. Frustrated by the lack of high-quality options in the U.S., they decided to create their own. More than just luxury tents, Novi Glamping provides thoughtfully designed spaces where guests can fully immerse themselves in nature while enjoying a refined and elevated experience.\nThe first NoviGlamping site is set to open in Spring 2025 in Virginia, nestled in the serene Shenandoah National Park, and less than two hours from Washington DC. This location will provide guests with a unique retreat where nature meets sophistication, all within reach of vibrant communities. The second location will open just two hours from Los Angeles, bringing the ultimate glamping experience near Joshua Tree National Park. Both sites are perfect for those who crave a reconnection with nature, but without sacrificing the comforts and luxuries of modern life. The other planned locations include the Catskills, less than two hours from New York.\nRomain's journey from sustainable development to eco-tourism highlights his dedication to creating meaningful, responsible travel experiences. \"Sustainability isn't just a buzzword; it's a way of life,\" Romain explains. \"Through Novi Glamping, we aim to make eco-luxury-tourism accessible, stylish, sophisticated, and deeply connected to nature, but always mindful of our environmental footprint.\"\nThe Novi Glamping experience is more than just an escape; it's an opportunity to reconnect with nature, yourself, and the people around you. Whether it’s a weekend getaway or a longer stay, Romain Pison’s expertise has ensured that each Novi Glamping site offers not only a luxurious retreat but also a commitment to sustainability.\nRomain Pison's innovative approach to blending luxury, nature, and sustainability through Novi Glamping showcases his vision for eco-tourism as more than just a trend but a lasting way to reconnect with what matters most. So, when was the last time you truly felt connected to the outdoors or the people around you? Perhaps it's time to rediscover that balance with Novi Glamping—where peace and connection meet, without ever feeling out of touch with the world.\n*The San Francisco Weekly newsroom and editorial were not involved in the creation of this content.",
