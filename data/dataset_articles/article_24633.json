  "text": "Green move: Plastic collection units come up in PU market In a ‘go green’ move, plastic collection units have been set up at two junctions in the market on the Panjab University (PU) campus. In addition, special benches, ‘Bench of Dreams’, made of recycled plastic waste have been set up at the entrance of the Department of Zoology so as to encourage students to dump plastic waste at the two booths. The university campus is one of the places in the city where plastic material is used in heavy quantity. Last month, Prof (Dr) Renu Vig, Vice-Chancellor, PU, had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the ‘Bottles for Change’ initiative on the campus in association with Bisleri International Private Limited. “Owing to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, plastic pollution threatens human health. The units have been set up under the ‘Bottles for Change’ initiative with an aim to sensitise the youth towards efficient disposal and recycling of plastic. Plastic pollution comes from improper disposal only. We are committed to make the PU plastic free and here it is as good as more bang for your buck as the discarded material is constructively processed for making usable products, including benches,” said Prof Vig. Dr Anuj Kumar, coordinator, Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, PU, added, “The notion behind this revolutionary initiative under the MoU is to promote plastic segregation among the citizenry. Plastic deposit containers have been placed at different locations on the PU campus to ensure a ‘sustainable future’ for the coming generations. Students and staff can put the waste plastic in these containers, which will be recycled productively and thus eradicate the menace of plastic on the campus.” “This is a welcome initiative and students should be made aware of it. Apart from the campus market, the collection units should be set up at the Student Centre and hostels too,” said Preeti, a student.",
