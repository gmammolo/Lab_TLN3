  "text": "Trees for Nipissing continues to plant trees in the North Bay area. On September 14th a group of volunteers from various local TD branches took part in TD Tree Days. It's the fourth year for the initiative which was held at the Marsh Drive landfill site. Close to 30 volunteers worked for 2.5 hours as they planted 400 trees. Peggy Walsh Craig, Chair of Trees for Nipissing, says its an important event that many of the volunteers look forward to. \"The reason we're doing this at the former landfill is because that site is eroding into Chippewa Creek, and people are using that land with their ATVs and snowmobiles,,\" said Walsh Craig. \"That's okay, but they make so many new trails all the time that contributes to the erosion. So we don't mind that they use that land, but we would like it to be a little bit less trailed up, as you might say, so we can work at restoring the land to the forest that it once was.\" Walsh Craig says they planted all native species of trees and had all ages of people participating. \"There was, I think the youngest was two and a half, and the oldest was in late 70s. And the TD Tree Days, the organization is always very impressed with how many trees we get in the ground for the number of volunteers that we have.\" This is one of a handful of Trees for Nipissing tree planting events the group is coordinating this fall. In the end, these initiatives aim to restore land and create lasting memories for volunteers",
