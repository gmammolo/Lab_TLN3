  "text": "Americas\nCAIR urges investigation after Palestinian-American teen killed by Israel\n'Amer Rabee’s killers must be held accountable,' Muslim advocacy group says, urging Congress to demand investigation\nWASHINGTON\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Wednesday called for an investigation into the killing of 14-year-old Palestinian-American Amer Mohammed Saada Rabee by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.\n“Amer Rabee’s killers must be held accountable,” said CAIR-New Jersey Director Selaedin Maksut, urging Congress to demand an investigation. “America is not only supplying the weapons that kill Americans abroad, it is aiding and abetting Israel’s impunity in war crimes and human rights violations.”\nCAIR representatives joined a press conference in Clifton, New Jersey, held by the Palestinian American Community Center, where Amer’s uncle serves as a board member.\nRabee, 14, born in Saddle Brook, New Jersey, was killed by Israeli army forces in the town of Turmus Ayya in the central West Bank on April 6.\nIsraeli authorities claimed Rabee and two other boys threw stones at Israeli vehicles on Route 60 near the town. His family denied the claim, saying Omar was in a field with friends eating fresh almonds.\nTwo other Palestinian children were also injured, including one seriously, in the same Israeli attack.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.
