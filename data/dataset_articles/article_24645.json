  "text": "Dozens of cats rescued from ‘overcrowded home’ in Wadena County GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. — Dozens of[ cats](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/nation-world/yellowstone-missing-cat-travels-hundreds-of-miles-back-home-california/507-fe52a5e7-8121-4185-b565-fb8f04f21c46) are now living with the Animal Humane Society after their owner released them to the group. AHS took in 55 cats from a single-family home in Wadena County. In a social media post, the group said this comes after an “urgent request from an overwhelmed caretaker.” The cats are generally healthy, AHS said in the post, but some are being treated for respiratory disease. “Knowing the situation was unsustainable and could quickly become dire, the owner released the cats to Animal Humane Society, ensuring their beloved felines would receive the expert medical and behavioral care they needed,” AHS said in the post. A spokesperson with AHS told KARE 11 they are still learning about each animal’s history and unique medical and behavioral needs, but some may start becoming available for[ adoption](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/adoption/cats) as early as next week. In the meantime, AHS is asking for [financial support](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/donate/make-gift) to take care of the new cats. Copyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.",
