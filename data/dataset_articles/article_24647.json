  "text": "Zero Carbon Certification for Chadstone Place Chadstone Place in Melbourne’s Chadstone Shopping Centre is believed to be the first Australian office building to achieve Zero Carbon Certification from the International Living Future Institute.\nThe fully electric building also achieved a 6 Star Green Star Design and a 6 Star Green Star Design and As Built certification and is targeting a 5.5 NABERS Energy rating.\nVicinity, the building’s owner, chose to retrofit the existing property rather than rebuild, leading to an estimated reduction of 85 per cent in embodied carbon.\nThis also saw 88 per cent of the building’s net lettable area could be reused and 90 per cent of all construction waste was diverted from landfill.\nNew tenant Officeworks, which aims for 100 per cent renewable energy by 2025 and net zero emissions by 2030, was approached by Vicinity to create an office space that would meet those requirements and set a new benchmark for green commercial buildings.\nVicinity’s national head of design, David Waldren, said the achievement shows that “the greenest buildings can be the ones that already exist.\n“This project is a bricks-and-mortar example of a building that meets the Paris Agreement goals of net zero emissions and moves us closer to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, embracing circular economy principles and delivers exceptional places for people.”\nAsian countries are cracking down on plastic. Malaysia has flagged new extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws, which will make producers pay for the management of end-of-life waste instead of cash-strapped local governments.\nExperts have raised questions over the effectiveness of the law, pointing to the Philippines, which enacted similar laws two years ago but needed help to get large enterprises to comply due to the unclear guidelines. Similar struggles can be seen in other Asian countries, such as Singapore, which has a deposit refund system for plastic bottles caught in delays. Vietnam received complaints about the exorbitant recycling fee.\nBusan in South Korea will follow in Malaysia’s footsteps with a landmark decision to finalise next month.\nWollemi Capital joins bid on low carbon cement Australian climate investment firm Wollemi Capital has joined several US investors in backing Californian based materials technology company Fortera in a Series C USD$85 million funding round.\nThe company has developed technology that reduces carbon dioxide in making cement by intercepting carbon dioxide exhaust from kilns and permanently sequestering it by mineralising the CO2 into ready-to-use cement. This cement can then be blended back into any non-green cement produced by the original plant.\nThe company claims the process lowers emissions by 70 per cent compared to ordinary cement on a ton-for-ton basis. The technology is currently under trial at ReCarb, the first full-scale plant in Redding, California, with a “bolt-on” cement plant, which can capture 6,600 tons of carbon dioxide annually and produce 15,000 tons of green cement.\nWollemi Capital says the US company did what all “previous cement technologies have failed to do”: to provide a solution for a cleaner industry.\nWhy are office buildings not being retrofitted? Why can’t we just turn these empty office buildings into housing? Here’s a fun clip tackling this very serious topic from former chief urban designer of The City of New York, Alexandros Washburn, answering this age old question:",
