  "text": "ISLAMABAD: Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam on Thursday said climate-resilient urban development would not only address immediate environmental challenges but also promote long-term sustainability, equity, and improve quality of life. Speaking at a meeting with the Chairman of the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Muhammad Ali Randhawa, she emphasized that extreme weather such as heat waves and urban flooding, were increasingly jeopardizing the lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure in Pakistan’s cities. A statement issued by the climate change ministry said that she stressed that building climate resilience in urban areas was critical to making them sustainable, livable, and adaptable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Romina Alam outlined the country’s vulnerability to climate risks, noting that cities like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar face rising temperatures, unpredictable rainfall, and other climate-related threats. She said the climate and environmental ministries were implementing policies to foster sustainable urban environments, with a particular focus on building resilience against these threats while improving living conditions for residents. She stressed upon cities to become environmentally sustainable to mitigate the growing threats of climate change. In Islamabad, Ms Alam said efforts would focus on increasing green spaces and enhancing the city’s tree cover, making it a model for other cities aiming to achieve sustainability goals. She also addressed the health risks associated with climate change, particularly advocating for the relocation of paper mulberry trees to alleviate pollen allergies. The CDA chairman briefed Ms Alam about several urban development projects that include renewable energy initiatives, environmental health improvements, zero waste strategies, and sustainable transport systems. He also shared plans to create an extensive bicycle route network throughout Islamabad to promote eco-friendly commuting. The meeting concluded with a commitment to joint efforts between the climate ministry and CDA, particularly in afforestation projects across 700 acres near Bhara Kahu. Both parties agreed to prioritise these initiatives as essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing urban areas to withstand future climate challenges.
