  "text": "[Urban Transportation](/news/urban-transportation)- 2 min read New plan to subsidise charging stations for 2 and 3-wheelers “This initiative aims to support deployment of 72,300 public charging stations (PCS) through a INR 2,000 crore allocation. Of these, 48,400 EV charging stations will be for two- and three-wheelers and 1,800 for buses,” an official said. New Delhi: The Centre has overhauled its plan to deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging stations by including subsidies for setting up two- and three-wheeler chargers. This is a significant development since earlier iterations of the EV subsidy scheme, called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME), did not support deployment of two- or three-wheeler charging stations. India has around 12,000 operational “This initiative aims to support deployment of 72,300 public charging stations (PCS) through a INR 2,000 crore allocation. Of these, 48,400 EV charging stations will be for two- and three-wheelers and 1,800 for buses,” an official said. Up to 80% of back-end infrastructure development costs will be subsidised under the newly launched INR 10,900 crore “The scheme will ensure that charging of EVs shifts to daytime when there is ample clean energy available in the country,” a second official said. In a directive issued in September, the power ministry maintained lower charges for charging EVs during solar hours (9 am to 4 pm). These ceiling rates are applicable till March 31, 2028, but are subject to an annual review, the ministry said. A final call on the per EV charger subsidy will also be taken by a project implementation and sanctioning committee (PISC) headed by secretary, ministry of heavy industries. “NHAI will oversee deployment of chargers at interstate highways and Indian Railways at stations. The chief secretary will decide where EV charging stations will be deployed in a state,” the official said. According to the PM E-DRIVE scheme document, the PISC will also decide on benchmark prices, number of guns and other technical parameters. Projects for Further, inter-linking of To learn more about the electric vehicle ecosystem and meet the key industry leaders, India has around 12,000 operational [EV charging stations](/tag/ev+charging+stations), which cater predominantly to cars.“This initiative aims to support deployment of 72,300 public charging stations (PCS) through a INR 2,000 crore allocation.

Projects for [charging infrastructure](/tag/charging+infrastructure)may also include infrastructure projects required for extending electrification for running of vehicles like pantograph charging and flash charging, among others.Further, inter-linking of [renewable energy](/tag/renewable+energy)sources with charging infrastructure and smart grid will be encouraged. The scheme also aims to ensure that push for localisation of EV charging stations is continued. It has been decided that there will be a minimum 50% of domestic value addition (DVA) in manufacturing of EV chargers from December 2024 onwards.To learn more about the electric vehicle ecosystem and meet the key industry leaders,",
