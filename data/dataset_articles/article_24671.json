  "text": "Australia’s power system is entering a “new paradigm” to take advantage of the most affordable energy for consumers today: variable renewable energy.\nThe shift moves the sunny, windy country away from the belief that only baseload power and peaking plants can ensure reliable electricity, Daniel Westerman, CEO of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) told RenewEconomy’s weekly Energy Insiders podcast.\n“We’ve sort of gone from an old historic construct of baseload and peaking to today’s world, and frankly, the future world of variable renewable energy and firming,” Westerman said. “And that’s kind of the new paradigm that we find ourselves in, in the power system.”\nWesterman said the rapid scale-up of Australia’s renewable energy capacity—and in particular, its recent achievements of supplying nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources—is charting a new path forward.\nAustralia’s grid is structured around maintaining a baseload power supply , where grid reliability hinges on maintaining a minimum level of available power. This approach is centered on supplying customers with the lowest-cost electricity, which historically has been produced from coal.\nCoal was “always on” and it provided the baseload of the power system because it was the cheapest, Westerman said. “And it was supplemented by peaking capacity… and that peaking was often gas, because it was the next most expensive.”\nIf demand grew past the cheapest plant’s capacity, AEMO would then dispatch the next cheapest alternative, and so on, with increasingly expensive energy sources.\nPodcast host David Leitch said while people often consider reliable electricity supply to be dependent on baseload, many CEOs of big utilities—who are the coal fired generators—“see that the era of baseload has passed, and that’s largely because of the growth of rooftop solar.”\nWesterman agreed the baseload strategy is outdated, now that wind and solar are the least-cost sources, being “free when the sun shines and the wind blows.”\n“But it’s not there all the time,” he said.\n“So what you do want is a power system that maximizes the output of the lowest-cost form of energy for consumers, that’s variable renewable energy, and then to fill in the gaps of that variable renewable energy with firming and ultimately backup power.”\nWhen he says firming, Westerman is referring to a process of supplementing renewable energy with another energy source, like a gas turbine , to fill supply gaps.\n“One of AEMO’s main priorities is to develop an engineering roadmap that will allow the grid to operate at 100% renewables at times, and Westerman is confident that can happen sometime soon,” RenewEconomy writes.",
