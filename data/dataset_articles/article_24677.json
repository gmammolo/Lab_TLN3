  "text": "Hundreds of people will take to the streets of Sydney tomorrow for a big and powerful rally demanding the Albanese government take action to protect Australia's precious species and landscapes. The rally coincides with preparations for next week's world-first Global Nature Positive Summit hosted by the Albanese government and stalling negotiations in parliament to fix our broken nature laws. Australia's extinction crisis is getting worse with much-loved species like the koala and greater glider on the brink. Shamefully, Australia is also a global deforestation hotspot. Details: March for Nature: No Nature, No Future! When: Tomorrow, Saturday 5 October, 11am. Where: Meet at Speakers Corner, The Domain, Sydney and then march through the Botanical Gardens. Media are invited to attend. B-roll and interviews will be sent around at 4pm. The march is co-hosted by the Australian Conservation Foundation, Birdlife, The Wilderness Society and NSW Conservation Council. Please note: this rally has received NSW Police approval and has been planned to cause as little disruption as possible. Contact details: Freya Cole 0477 638 774",
