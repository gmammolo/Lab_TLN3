This year's California fall foliage season in the eastern Sierra is starting out with a flourish. \"I think the season is pretty much on track,\" said Lara Kaylor, the editor and publisher of California Fall Color, a crowdsourced website that provides the most up-to-date information on fall foliage conditions throughout the state. \"I think we're in for a really beautiful show in eastern Sierra for the next few weeks.\"\nA mid-September cold snap in the mountains helped kick off the transition to fall, with temperatures plunging below freezing and snow accumulating on the highest peaks.\n\"It definitely got things moving,\" said Kaylor. \"And there are areas in the eastern Sierra that are starting to be near peak.\"\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\nFall colors appear near Sagehen Summit, Calif., on Sept. 16, 2024.
