  "text": "Press release from the issuing company Boulder, CO. USA - PrintReleaf, the global industry leader in sustainable solutions and environmental offsets for printers and packaging companies, is excited to announce a new data integration with Printerpoint, a cloud-based fleet management system and the only solution that accurately captures wide format print data across a number of manufacturers like Canon, HP, Epson, and more. Sustainability has become an increasingly important consideration, especially in businesses that rely heavily on printing. It is imperative for Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC), Graphics, Sign shops, and Manufacturing businesses to not only track their wide format print activity for internal allocation and bill back purposes, but also to offset their environmental impact. For over a decade, printer dealers have been using Printerpoint to support their MPS contracts when it comes to service, supplies, and billing needs. While other solutions only collect meter reads, Printerpoint leads the way in collecting complex, wide format meters (print jobs, square footage, etc). Printerpoint also has a unique paper tracking system that knows the type of paper roll and weight (20lb, 24lb, mylar, etc), which allows PrintReleaf to accurately calculate the forest impact of every wide format print job. “Through our partnership with PrintReleaf, Printerpoint enables dealers to provide certified environmental offsets for wide format printing – a first in the industry.” - Michael Jacobs | Director of Sales, Printerpoint The integration between Printerpoint and PrintReleaf provides dealers one single sustainability and DCA platform for their entire printer fleet – MFPs and wide format. Every dealer using Printerpoint can now effortlessly measure their forest footprint and automatically offset their paper consumption with certified environmental offsets, including global reforestation and carbon offset initiatives. Printerpoint customers are invited to contact PrintReleaf to turn on the sustainability service, and start offsetting the trees and carbon they're using in conjunction with the print activity across their entire fleet. **About PrintReleaf** PrintReleaf helps companies meet their sustainability goals by automatically reforesting the equivalence of their paper and fiber-based materials consumption and offsetting the carbon emissions associated with their paper and packaging products. PrintReleaf empowers companies to make a positive impact on the environment and foster brand differentiation, as committing to meet sustainability goals wins new customers and is good for the planet and your bottom line.

For over two decades, the Printerpoint team has focused on building solutions to meet the unique needs of the entire printer distribution channel.
