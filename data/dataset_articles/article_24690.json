  "text": "Press release from the issuing company Northumberland, UK - Printed.com is proud to announce the launch of its new line of eco-friendly seed-based paper and PVC free banner material. By sending zero to landfill, recycling 96% of waste and using the remainder for RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel), this initiative further underscores the company's commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable business practices. The introduction of both products is a testament to its dedication to reducing environmental impact. The seed-based paper is not only biodegradable but also embedded with seeds that can grow into wildflowers. Once the printed material has served its purpose, it can be planted to give back to the environment. Supporting Biodiversity and Reducing Waste Every sheet of seed-based paper helps support biodiversity and reduces waste that would otherwise end up in landfill. This product not only minimises environmental impact but also creates a tangible connection between businesses and their commitment to sustainability. Printed.com already offers products that derive from a range of sustainable materials that are biodegradable or recyclable. Printed.com also offer environmental packaging consisting of eco foam rollers which are 100% recyclable and made in the UK to reduce carbon footprint, 100% recycled Kraft paper tape which uses natural rubber-based adhesives and recyclable business card boxes made from recycled card along with using vegetable based inks. Made from post-consumer or pre-consumer waste, recycled paper is a great choice for businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact. A Step Towards a Greener Future This initiative aligns with global efforts to promote sustainability and reduce waste, businesses and individuals can contribute to a greener future. This innovative product is suitable for a wide range of uses, including business cards, menus, and invitations.
