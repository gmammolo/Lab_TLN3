  "text": "Chinese researchers have discovered a new horned toad species, which has been named Boulenophrys pepe, in Lianshan Bijiashan Nature Reserve in south China's Guangdong Province.\nThe research findings, led by Guangdong Polytechnic of Environmental Protection Engineering and other institutions, were published in a recent edition of the international academic journal Zootaxa.\nThe new species was discovered in evergreen broadleaf forests at altitudes of 490 to 540 meters, where mountain streams and a layer of leaf litter create diverse microhabitat systems.\nThe toad, notable for its swollen lips, differs significantly from closely related species in the same area, according to Lin Shishi, a member of the research team.\nLin noted that Boulenophrys pepe is highly sensitive to changes in the forest ecosystem. The discovery of this new toad species enhances the understanding of biodiversity and shows that China's conservation efforts to protect mountain forest ecosystems have been very effective, Lin said.",
