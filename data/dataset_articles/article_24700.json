  "text": "The San Antonio Zoo and Zoo Miami announced yesterday the release of 50 Texas horned lizards ( Phrynosoma cornutum ) at a ranch in Blanco County, TX. The lizards came from seven clutches that were raised at the San Antonio Zoo’s Center for Conservation & Research (CCR). They were approximate 2.5 to 3.5 months old at the time of the release and weighed between 3.4 and 12 grams, according to a press release posted on the San Antonio Zoo’s Facebook page.\n“Participating in this release was a unique opportunity,” Dr. Andy Gluesenkamp, Director of the CCR said in the post on social media. “The presence of influential figures like Josh Abbott and international guests highlights the widespread support and enthusiasm for our efforts. By rigorously evaluating candidate release sites and partnering with landowners, we’re laying the groundwork for the successful reintroduction of this treasured species.”\nSince the Texas Horned Lizard Reintroduction Project launched in 2017, 258 captive born and bred lizards have been released into the wild. The project also relies on the The Texas Horned Lizard Detection Canine Network with assistance from Chiron K9 to track the movements of these lizards. The dogs are trained to smell the lizard’s scat, or poop, as they move about their new environments.",
