  "text": "Fourteen Pacific Island nations gathered in Nadi, Fiji, for the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) COP29 Ministerial Preparatory Climate Change meeting.\nThis key event marked a crucial step in the region’s preparations for the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan from 11th – 22nd November 2024.\nDiscussions focused on reinforcing Pacific solidarity and advancing a unified regional strategy leading up to the annual global event.\nCook Islands Deputy High Commissioner to Fiji, Antonina Browne represented the Cook Islands at the meeting, joining ministers and officials to assess the current climate challenges and shape the Pacific’s strategic high-level approach for COP29.\nThe meeting was chaired by PSIDS Chair, John Salong, Minister of Climate Change for Vanuatu and supported by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) Director-General, Sefanaia Nawadra.\nDubbed the ‘Finance COP’, the Pacific’s priorities heading into COP29 include securing increased financial support through the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance.\nCook Islands Director of Climate Change and PSIDS Climate Finance Coordinator, Wayne King, delivered a presentation on the NCQG, emphasising the region’s key messages: PSIDS are calling for grants-based, new and additional climate finance to meet the unique vulnerabilities of small island developing states.\nDHC Browne joined others in emphasising the finalisation of the NCQG in Baku, in a manner that serves the interests of our region.\n“For small island nations like ours, access to adequate and timely climate finance is critical. The NCQG must recognise the special circumstances of Pacific SIDS as enshrined in the Paris Agreement and do away with arbitrary economic thresholds to ensure that finance is immediately directed where it is needed the most.”\nThe 1.5 degree temperature goal remained a prominent focus throughout the meeting. Ministers reinforced that achieving this goal is imperative for the Pacific’s survival, underscoring the urgency of scaling up mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “For the Pacific, every fraction of a degree matters. Reaching the 1.5-degree goal requires significantly enhanced ambition and commitment from wealthy nations in both climate finance and mitigation,” said DHC Browne.\nFramed by the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, the PSIDS Ministerial Pre-COP Meeting provided an important platform for Pacific nations to further align their priorities ahead of COP29, DHC Browne encouraged effective prioritisation during this critical time, highlighting the heavy responsibilities many Pacific nations shoulder as they face increasing demands on rapidly diminishing resources – “through focused collaboration under the technical guidance of our One-CROP officials, the Pacific has a crucial opportunity at COP29 to drive the global response to our region’s growing needs.”\nThe region’s focus on securing financial commitments particularly under the NCQG will continue throughout the week’s technical discussions…..PACNEWS/COOK ISLANDS GOVT",
