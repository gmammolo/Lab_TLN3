Traditional vs. Smart solar inverters A solar inverter is a crucial component of any solar energy system. It converts the direct current (DC) electricity produced by solar panels into alternating (AC) electricity used in homes and businesses.\nTraditional solar inverters Traditional solar inverters are relatively simple devices that have been used for many years. They are typically designed to operate at a fixed frequency and voltage, which means they may only be able to operate at their maximum efficiency under certain conditions.\nWhat are smart solar inverters? Smart solar inverters, a more advanced type of inverter designed to improve solar energy systems’ efficiency, are a key component of energy-efficient solar systems.\nThey have various features to optimise the system’s performance under different conditions. A new generation of inverters offers advanced features to improve energy efficiency and system performance.\nKey features of smart solar inverters Some of the key features of smart solar inverters include:\nMaximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT): MPPT technology ensures that the inverter extracts the maximum power from the solar panels, regardless of changing weather conditions. Reactive power control: Smart inverters can control reactive power, improving the grid’s overall power quality. Self-diagnostics and monitoring: Smart inverters are equipped with self-diagnostic features that can help to identify and troubleshoot problems. They also monitor real-time system performance, allowing users to track energy production and consumption. Remote monitoring and control: Many smart inverters can be monitored and controlled remotely using a smartphone or computer. This allows users to optimise system performance and troubleshoot problems from anywhere worldwide. Grid synchronisation: Smart inverters can seamlessly synchronise with the grid, ensuring that the solar system operates harmoniously with the broader electricity network. Energy storage integration: Some smart inverters are compatible with solar battery storage systems , allowing users to store excess solar energy during high demand or grid outages. Use Energy Matters’ easy-to-use solar power and battery storage calculator to determine the size of your solar system with storage! Our solar calculator will generate performance information and potential savings.\nWe can send this information to 3 of our pre-vetted and trusted local installers in your area to receive obligation-free solar quotes .\nHow do smart solar inverters improve energy efficiency? Smart solar inverters can improve energy efficiency in several ways. One is by maximising the amount of energy produced by the solar panels. Smart inverters can do this by constantly monitoring the panels’ output and adjusting the inverter’s settings accordingly. This ensures that the inverter is always operating at its maximum efficiency.\nAnother way smart solar inverters can improve energy efficiency is by reducing energy losses. Traditional inverters can lose a significant amount of energy due to design inefficiencies. Smart inverters, on the other hand, are designed to be much more efficient. This means that they can reduce energy losses by up to 20%.\nBenefits of smart solar inverters for homes and businesses The benefits of using smart solar inverters include:\nBenefits for homes Enhanced energy efficiency: Smart inverters optimise power output, ensuring maximum energy generation from solar panels. Remote monitoring and control: Many smart inverters offer mobile apps or web portals for real-time monitoring, allowing homeowners to track energy production, consumption, and system performance. Grid Integration and backup power: Some smart inverters support grid-tied or off-grid configurations, enabling homeowners to sell excess energy back to the grid or use solar power as a backup during outages. Advanced safety features: Smart inverters often include built-in safety features like rapid shutdown, arc fault protection, and overcurrent protection to safeguard the system and occupants. Solar for businesses: The role of smart solar inverters Australia’s businesses increasingly turn to solar energy to reduce costs and improve environmental sustainability. Smart solar inverters are vital in helping businesses maximise solar energy’s benefits. Smart inverters can help businesses achieve energy efficiency goals and reduce operating costs by optimising system performance and providing advanced monitoring and control features.\nBenefits for businesses Reduced operational costs: Businesses can significantly lower their electricity bills by generating solar power, increasing profitability. Improved energy independence: Businesses can become less reliant on the grid, reducing their vulnerability to power outages and fluctuations in energy prices. Enhanced sustainability: Solar power systems with smart inverters contribute to a more sustainable future by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy. Tax incentives and rebates: Many governments offer incentives, such as tax credits or rebates, to encourage businesses to adopt solar power systems. Finding the right solar incentives\nYour location, system size, and property type will determine the specific incentives you qualify for. Check our pages for the most up-to-date information and applicable rebates.\nHome Solar Rebates, Incentives & Subsidies In Australia Commercial Solar Rebates, Grants & Incentives Solar Battery System Rebates, Subsidies, & Incentives Off Grid Solar Power Rebates For Remote Installations Choosing the right smart solar inverter When selecting a smart solar inverter for your home or business, it is important to consider some factors, including:\nSystem size: The inverter must be sized to match the capacity of your solar panels. Compatibility: The inverter must be compatible with your other solar system components, such as the solar panels and battery storage system (if applicable). Features: Consider the specific features that are important to you, such as MPPT technology, reactive power control, and remote monitoring capabilities. Efficiency: To get the most out of your solar energy system, look for an inverter with a high-efficiency rating. Warranty: A long warranty period can provide peace of mind and protection against unexpected problems. Smart solar inverters are valuable for improving energy efficiency in Australia’s homes and businesses. Maximising power output, optimising system performance, and providing advanced monitoring and control features can help reduce electricity costs, increase system reliability, and enhance grid stability.\nAs Australia transitions towards a clean energy future, smart solar inverters will become increasingly important in helping the country achieve its energy efficiency and sustainability goals.
