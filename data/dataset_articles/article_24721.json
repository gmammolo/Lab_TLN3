  "text": "‘Yale @ Climate Week NYC’ highlights international progress, scaling solutions Over a four-day summit in New York, from September 24-27, Yale scholars and other thought leaders in a wide range of fields came together to bring to the foreground solutions to confront the climate crisis. Hosted at the Yale Club in New York City, the ’Yale @ Climate Week‘ gathering coincided with Climate Week NYC and events surrounding the opening of the 79th session of UN General Assembly. Yale’s summit was organized by [Yale Planetary Solutions](https://planetarysolutions.yale.edu/), with support from the [Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies](https://macmillan.yale.edu/). Throughout the summit, participants spoke to the importance of expanding and scaling up climate solutions. While climate change presents acute challenges, panelists emphasized the potential for collaboration, development, and capacity building around the world. In her opening remarks, Yale President Maurie McInnis highlighted the university’s efforts to address the climate crisis, especially the work of Yale Planetary Solutions, which she describes as the “north star” for all that Yale is and does regarding climate. “In the months to come, we intend to create more opportunities for the world’s most purpose-driven companies and organizations to engage with Yale and with its scholars,” McInnis said. “We have bold ambitions, supported by a community that is motivated, passionate, and prepared to invest in Yale’s trailblazing spirit and expand an international effort that guides humanity towards the solutions it needs to ensure the health and vibrancy of this planet.” The first session following the opening of the summit was led by Dan Esty, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy, and featured U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ’78 of Rhode Island; Rob Bonta ’93, ’98 J.D., California’s attorney general; and Fred Krupp ’75, president of the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). Whitehouse highlighted how the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which will take effect in 2026, will “put pressure on the U.S.” as European nations implement a carbon tariff system. Krupp echoed the focus on emissions by highlighting the vulnerability of tropical rainforests, and the impact of greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide, especially methane. During Tuesday’s evening session, former Secretary of State and first-ever U.S. Special Envoy for Climate John Kerry ’66 spoke on the political realities of addressing climate change. Despite challenging global events, Kerry underscored humanity’s potential to realize a sustainable future. “We can win this battle,” Kerry said. “I’m not kidding you when I say we can win this battle still, but we have to behave differently. We have to do things that we’re just resisting or ignoring.” Throughout the week, a range of topics oriented around international policy were highlighted by panelists from different backgrounds. One such topic was the issue of climate migration, a global phenomenon driven by changing environmental conditions and unequal development. In a talk on Wednesday titled “Flipping the Model: Leveraging Academic Perspectives to Reinvent Multilateralism,” former President of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesada noted that for policymakers, migration is not just an isolated topic. Migration is also related to issues of conflict, economic security, food security, and climate change, Alvarado noted. For many regions of the world, climate migration is already occurring. In a Thursday talk titled “Geopolitics and the Environment in Central Asia,” Sarah Cameron Ph.D ’10, an Associate Professor of History at the University of Maryland, discussed how Central Asia has already seen climate migration, especially in the case of the Aral Sea drying. Both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have been experiencing climate migration for years. Later that day, in a panel discussion titled, “Developing Evidence-Based Scalable Adaptation Solutions in Early Climate Battlegrounds: The Case of Coastal Bangladesh,” Yale researchers and an expert from BRAC discussed the role of climate change in internal migration. Within Bangladesh, changing farming practices resulting from increasingly salty water and natural disasters have caused climate migration within the country, especially out of rural areas. “When we talk about climate migration it’s not like I can go and ask a person, ‘Why are you in Dhaka today?’” said Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, the Jerome Kasoff ’54 Professor of Management and Economics. Although the cause might involve the effects of climate change, “That’s not how they would answer it — but it is the case because their livelihood options are disappearing, they’re showing up elsewhere.” On Friday, five panelists discussed the link between climate migration and a range of fields in a talk titled “Climate and Migration: Politics and the Humanitarian Response.” Panelists tackled the social and health needs for migrants, the rhetoric of elections, governance challenges, and initiatives to address climate migration. The [Remaking Trade for a Sustainable Future Project](https://remakingtradeproject.org/), co-led by Esty, is focused on reforming the principles of international trade to align with sustainability. The project’s leadership hosted a panel on Wednesday titled “Remaking the International Trade System for Climate Change Action.” In addition to Esty, speakers included Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General World Trade Organization; Ali Zaidi, the White House National Climate Advisor; Elena Cima, Lecturer University of Geneva; Philippe Varin, Chair of the International Chamber of Commerce; and David Turk, Deputy Secretary U.S. Department of Energy. Beyond economic trade, cooperation between nations is also a topic at the forefront in addressing the climate crisis, especially for least developed countries. In his Wednesday talk, President Alvarado highlighted the gaps in cooperation between large states and blocs of power when it came to sharing knowledge. Without cooperation, Alvarado says, there can’t be trust between these nations. The subject of support for international development efforts consistently recurred as speakers highlighted the inequity of the climate crisis. Leaders from the Yale Center on Climate Change and Health joined experts from UNICEF in engaging with audience members in a workshop on Thursday, followed by a networking event. On Thursday, Jessica Seddon, Senior Fellow and Director of the Deitz Family Initiative on Environment and Global Affairs at the Jackson School of Global Affairs, joined filmmaker Rishi Chandna and Arunabha Ghosh, founder of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, in a talk titled “Narrative, Data, Action: Connecting the Dots from South Indian Stories to Global Water Governance Needs.” A Tamil-language short film, “Virundhu,” was screened at this event and focused on the role narrative storytelling and data play in inspiring action. Many panelists highlighted the successes that have been achieved through research, work, and advocacy from around the world. For example, despite the Aral Sea’s dramatic shrinkage and increasing salinity, Cameron highlighted the resiliency of fish populations. And while millions in Bangladesh are experiencing salinized water, solutions are being developed to help mitigate the impact and assist those affected so they can adapt to evolving environmental conditions. A collaboration between BRAC and Y-RISE addresses this issue and seeks to expand and improve water collection programs, including through local entrepreneurship. ~~~ To learn more about the Yale @ Climate Week NYC summit, [visit the Yale News website](https://news.yale.edu/in-focus/yale-climate-week-nyc-2024)[.](http://world.yale.edu)",
