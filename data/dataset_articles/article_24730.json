The team at Griffith University’s Ethos Project (Extreme Heat and Older Persons) are once again calling on Queenslanders over the age of 65 to take part in Phase 2 of an in-home early warning system for heat in a warming climate. Using small sensors to monitor home temperatures and humidity via a smart phone app developed by the research team, the Ethos system alerts users when these levels become dangerous and provide personalised cooling recommendations to reduce heat health risk. As a new addition to the technology for this year’s trial, the team has developed a mobile app for use as the system interface. [Associate Professor Shannon Rutherford](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/9411-shannon-rutherford), who co-leads the Ethos Project, said the second phase of the trial – to take place from November-March – would also expand into more locations. “We had a great response from South East Queensland for our first trials, but we want to hear more from those living in warmer regions, where prolonged heat exposure may be more prevalent and more risky for our older community members,” Associate Professor Rutherford said. Extreme heat kills more people in Australia than any other natural disaster. In Queensland alone, more than 100 lives are lost each year from exposure to high temperatures. Without taking the right steps to protect ourselves and keep our homes cool, extreme heat can lead to heat-related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. The Ethos system works by: - Collecting real-time humidity and temperature data from inside and outside the home using four non-invasive sensors; - Connecting to the local weather station and displays that information to the user to assist with planning daily and weekly activities; - Providing individualised heat alerts when projected core temperature is increasing; - Suggesting cooling strategies that are acceptable and accessible to the user. Upon installation, Ethos team members input the user’s height, weight, age and sex into the app. This allows the system to individualise heat alerts to that specific person. In last year’s phase one of the trial, the Ethos team travelled more than 4,500km in total to install, repair, and collect the systems from their 78 participants. After the trial concluded, the team found: - 13% of participants reported being extremely concerned about the effects of heatwaves on them personally after the trial compared to 1.3% before the trial - 36% of participants were well informed about the consequences of heatwaves on their health after the trial compared to 12.9% at the beginning of the trial - 46% of participants strongly agreed that heatwaves pose a risk to their health after the trial compared to 32.1% before the trial. - 85% of participants felt that they were well prepared for heatwaves after the trial compared to 70% before the trial. For the upcoming phase two of the trial, participants can also opt to trial the Ethos app with a Fitbit (which they will get to keep), and receive a $50 gift card for participation, or a Fitbit if they are involved in the Fitbit sub-study. To join the trial, participants must be: - Aged over 65 years, - Live in Southeast Queensland or Hervey Bay - Have an iPhone (model 6s or higher) - Willing to complete a confidential health history questionnaire - Do not have a diagnosis of a psychological or cognitive disorder such as schizophrenia or dementia.
