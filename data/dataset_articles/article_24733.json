  "text": "NUNAPITCHUK, Alaska., Oct. 2, 2024 – U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development State Director Julia Hnilicka announced today that the USDA is investing $2,181,000 million in grant to construct a new municipal solid waste facility for the city of Nunapitchuk, Alaska. This project will close and cap the landfill and construct an access road. Funds will also be used in conjunction with Indian Health Service (IHS) to construct the new landfill.\n\"In our remote communities, USDA Rural Development recognizes that the health of our landfills is tied to the health of our communities,” says Hnilicka, “We are proud to partner with IHS on this critical infrastructure for Nunapitchuk.\"\nThis investment is funded through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Waste Disposal Loan & Grant program, which provides funding for clean and reliable drinking water systems, sanitary sewage disposal, sanitary solid waste disposal, and storm water drainage to households and businesses in eligible rural areas.\nNationwide, the Department is investing $1.3 billion to support projects in 30 states. The investments advance President Biden’s Investing in America agenda to grow the American economy from the middle out and bottom up. USDA is investing in 116 projects across the nation to expand access to a clean and reliable electric grid, safe drinking water and good-paying jobs for people in rural and Tribal communities. Part of the funding announced today will make water infrastructure in rural areas more resilient to the impacts of climate change and severe weather.\nUnder the Biden-Harris Administration, USDA Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities, create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements; business development; housing; community facilities such as schools, public safety and healthcare; and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal and high-poverty areas. Visit the Rural Data Gateway to learn how and where these investments are impacting rural America.
