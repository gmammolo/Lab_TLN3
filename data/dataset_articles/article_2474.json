  "text": "Huge Update in Prince Andrew 'Sex Abuse Victim' Saga — As Virginia Giuffre's Court Case is Postponed After her Murky 'Near-Death' Crash Claims\nApril 9 2025, Published 5:30 p.m. ET\nVirginia Giuffre's court case over an alleged breach of a restraining order has been postponed — days after claiming a bus crash left her close to death.\nRadarOnline.com can reveal Prince Andrew's accuser has been embroiled in a major saga in recent weeks.\nShe had been charged with breaching a family violence restraining order on February 2.\nIt comes amid claims she has just \"four days to live\" following a 110 mph car crash in Perth, Western Australia.\nHer case was first heard in Joondalup Magistrates' Court in northern Perth last month where she did not enter a plea.\nBut a follow up hearing was postponed today due to Giuffre, 41, still recovering from a number of injuries sustained after a collision.\nShe shared an image of her badly bruised face in a hospital bed at the end of last month and claimed she was involved in a high-speed crash with a bus.\nA statement alongside the image saw her say she had just days left to live as she begged to see her kids \"one last time.\"\nThe remark sparked huge debate among online sleuths after conflicting police and eyewitness reports were made.\nAustralian cops confirmed the crash took place but said no one was injured.\nParents of the children on the bus also spoke out against Giuffre's claims and said the accident wasn't as bad as it had been made out.\nEarlier this week, Giuffre was officially discharged from hospital a week after the crash.\nShe left through the back door of the hospital to avoid the media circus which was awaiting her departure.\nAnd Giuffre's U.S. agent Dini von Mueffling confirmed she is \"slowly improving.\"\nMany reporters were ready to question the woman who helped to get Jeffery Epstein convicted as a sex trafficker after she said just days prior that she \"accidentally\" claimed the bus crash left her close to death.\nHer brother, Sky Roberts, cleared up the claim as he explained that doctors told Giuffre she would have died within four days had she not received medical treatment.\nAnother major update to the saga saw her say she endured years of alleged domestic violence at the hands of her husband, Robert.\nGiuffre claimed in a previous statement that on January 9 this year, her husband physically assaulted her in Dunsborough, Western Australia.\nThe pair had separated in August 2023 but stayed in contact due to sharing a number of children together.\nThe restraining order is said to involve Robert and the children.\nGiuffre accused Andrew of sexually abusing her when she was 17 while she traveled with Andrew's paedo pals Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThree years ago, the disgraced Duke paid millions to the mom-of-three in an out-of-court settlement, while denying sexual assault accusations.\nAndrew was spared a humiliating court battle over claims he sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.",
