(WCJB) - A University of Florida basketball fan could be charged criminally after a stunt ended in him falling off a traffic light in Gainesville.\nOfficers say charges against Steven Buchanan, 28, are “forthcoming” after he was injured falling from a traffic signal on West University Avenue.\nRELATED: Fans flood University Avenue after Florida wins NCAA National Championship\nThousands of Gator fans poured onto the roadway from various watch parties after the UF Men’s Basketball Team won the national championship on Monday night.\nMultiple camera angles showed a man officers identified as Buchanan climbing up the traffic light pole at the intersection of Northwest 17th Street.\nAfter reaching the top, the daredevil scooted along the pole over the intersection, bouncing the traffic signal. As he tried to stand, he toppled over and fell onto the pavement below.\nFire rescue crews quickly responded and took him to the hospital for treatment of injuries that weren’t life-threatening.\nRELATED: Gator fans arrested in Gainesville during basketball championship celebrations\nOfficers say the investigation into Buchanan is ongoing. Three other people were arrested during the post-game celebrations.\nBefore the game, Gainesville Public Works employees greased poles in the area to discourage climbers.\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2025 WCJB.
