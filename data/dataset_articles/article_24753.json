  "text": "LITTLE ROCK (KATV) — Little Rock's 4.9 MW solar array development project is now interconnected with Entergy Arkansas, to meet net-metering policies. Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr. is looking ahead at environmental and fiscal benefits. “This was a critical first step in having the interconnection, so we would be grandfathered in with the net-metering policies that help us raise or save a million dollars,\" Scott says. The project will use alternating currents to generate electricity in the city. Scott sees this project as being a part of a broader effort of the city's clean energy goals. “The goals of the project, number one, is to make certain that we reach our 2030 renewable clean energy plan,\" Scott says. \"With the flip of a switch once this is completed, it will take us close to 70%. We’re also working on a sustainable energy district as well to get us to completely 100%.” It's a 12-million-dollar project, with an expected 4–6-million-dollar reduction on the project by the Biden-Harris Inflation Reduction Act set to hit the city. “This project is necessary to make certain that the city continues to lead as it related to sustainability, but also make certain our residents will understand how we can be a more clean city, but also focus on fiscal savings,\" Scott says. In another effort toward clean energy, Scott says if the 'Results for the Rock' passes in the upcoming election, close to 50 new electric vehicle charging stations in the city are promised. Little Rock residents will have the final say on that sales tax increase when they go to the polls on Nov. 5. The deadline to register to vote is Monday, Oct. 7.",
