  "text": "British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Andrew Patrick (fourth from left) with British Council Sri Lanka Country Director Orlando Edwards (fifth from left), alongside the British Council Colombo staff-in-charge of the solar for change project\nBritish High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Andrew Patrick addressing the gathering\nBritish Council Sri Lanka Country Director Orlando Edwards speaking at the event\nThe British Council Colombo office today adopted solar power to generate 100% of its energy requirements.\nAs part of the project and its commitment to becoming greener, the Colombo office is installing 353 units of 220kWp solar PV panels. Through this first-of-its-kind project, the British Council Colombo office will save 285.97 tonnes of CO2 annually for the next 25 years.\nThe official launch of the solar power system was held under the patronage of Chief Guest British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Andrew Patrick, accompanied by Deputy British High Commissioner Lisa Whanstall and British Council Sri Lanka Country Director Orlando Edwards. The event was also attended by stakeholders, staff of the Colombo office, and media.\nThe initiative sets a strong example for the values and ethos that the British Council Colombo stands for in advocating for sustainable development. The peak hours of operation at the Colombo office are between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., which are also the optimum peak hours for consumption of electricity in Sri Lanka. The solar power adoption, therefore, will also contribute to lessening the load on the national grid.\nSpeaking virtually at the launch of the solar power system, British Council CEO Scott McDonald said: “I’m delighted our Colombo office is transitioning to solar energy. This project will allow us to generate an impressive 100% of the office’s energy needs through renewable sources. This will reduce our CO2 emissions by an estimated 285 tonnes annually for the next 25 years. This highlights our commitment to sustainability and to addressing the significant challenges of the climate emergency, while contributing positively to the communities we serve.”\nThe British Council Colombo will continue its endeavours to secure a greener future, while also enhancing its operations and providing more opportunities to its patrons and members.",
