  "text": "Nature Walk 10/3/24 Went for a walk on the res and on the paths behind on Thursday around 5pm for about 45 minutes. It was very nice out--about 70 and pretty sunny although the sun was setting. I didn't find any fungi other than lichen, though I was not looking in an area that one would expect to see any. The lichen was on many of the trees and I've attached a photo of it, and though I think I might have seen more than one variation I wasn't 100% positive and didn't take a photo. Though, I probably should have. I was surprised to see that lichen were technically fungi, and I feel like it goes to show how diverse a specific kingdom can be. To me, I'd assume that a more typical, say, mushroom would be different to lichen but it's interesting nonetheless. When I looked up the distinction, I was surprised to find that, \"Lichens are a complex life form that is a symbiotic partnership of two separate organisms, a fungus and an alga.\" It goes to show how diverse the classifications we use can be. Of the other plants I saw, there was some moss which was cool to see. It was on the same side of all the trees I saw, which was interesting because I know that isn't always the case. I also found some pretty flowers, as well as some berries. I did, however, struggle to identify the exact species--though i-naturalist did provide broader categories that I believe to be accurate.",
