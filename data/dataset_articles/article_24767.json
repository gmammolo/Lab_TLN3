  "text": "ESSEN (dpa-AFX) - According to an Eon study, electric cars have great potential as electricity storage systems for households. The Essen-based energy company published an analysis according to which electric cars with special battery technology together could mathematically store enough electricity to supply 1.75 million households with energy for twelve hours. Eon is referring to the 166,000 or so electric cars registered in Germany that are ready for bidirectional charging (\"bidi-ready\").\nThis involves storing electricity in the car battery that has been generated by a photovoltaic system on a homeowner's roof, for example. Later, electricity from the car parked in front of the house flows into the home to cover the energy requirements there. The battery is therefore not only used to drive the car, but also becomes a temporary storage device so that the user is somewhat less dependent on energy from the power grid.\nHouseholds could become less dependent on the power grid\nSo far, bidirectional charging has been a niche market. According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority, there are 60.7 million registered vehicles in Germany. The 166,000 \"bidi-ready\" cars mentioned by Eon - mainly models from Asian manufacturers - therefore only make up around 0.3 percent of the entire German vehicle fleet.\n\"A nationwide, comprehensive use of the technology is currently being tested,\" says Eon manager Filip Thon and advocates using the e-car battery \"not just for driving, but as an integrated part of our energy system\". The Eon analysis is a thought experiment that emphasizes the great potential of this still young technology./wdw/DP/zb\nShare Go to the original article .\nLegal disclaimer Legal disclaimer\nContact us to request a correction\nBack © dpa-AFX - 2024",
