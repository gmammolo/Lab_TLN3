  "text": "ASHEVILLE, N.C., Oct. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- While the full impact of Hurricane Helene and its aftermath, including catastrophic rain and flooding, is still unknown, relief efforts continue, and HomeTrust Bank is committed and prepared to serve its employees and customers who were affected.'Our thoughts and prayers are with the many families and businesses impacted by the devastating flooding,” said C. Hunter Westbrook, President & Chief Executive Officer. 'We want to assure everyone affected of our firm commitment to work with you to provide the banking support needed for your home, your business and our great communities.
