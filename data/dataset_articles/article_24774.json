  "text": "Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury offers a variety of edible plants supporting food resilience and sustainability, including apricots, figs, guavas, feijoas, pears, plums, and olives, located around its Ilam campus. You can use the [edible campus foraging map](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/content/dam/uoc-main-site/documents/pdfs/d-other/ENGS8001_Edible_campus_map.pdf.coredownload.pdf) to explore and find these tasty treasures when in season. These plantings aren’t just about free food; they’re about connecting UC’s community with nature, sustainability, and food security. In 2023, UC signed the [Edible Canterbury Charter](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/news-and-events/news/uc-signs-up-to-edible-canterbury-charter) to support food resilience across the region. This charter guides UC’s commitment to planting and sharing fresh produce, fostering healthy communities, and building local food systems. It’s part of a broader effort to make sure everyone has access to healthy, affordable and locally grown food. With global challenges like climate change and food insecurity, UC’s edible campus and future food research are paving the way for a better future. So next time you’re on campus, grab a fresh plum or fig (when in season) and know you are part of a journey towards food resilience and sustainability.
