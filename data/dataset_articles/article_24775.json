  "text": "Wild Ones South Bend Chapter is working with South Bend Parks, Venues and Arts in hosting its fall native plant sale. Bernacchi’s Oak Valley Greenhouses, Blue Fox Farms, Botany Shop, Chapman Lake Nursery, Naiad Native Plants, and Naturally Native Nursery will offer many species of native plants, trees, and shrubs. Several local ecology groups will be on hand for educational outreach. Native plants are those that occur naturally in a region in which they evolved. They are the ecological basis upon which life depends, including birds and people. Without them and the insects that co-evolved with them, local birds cannot survive. Planting native plants help to ensure the biodiversity of a region while supporting our pollinators. Availability of native plant resources is crucial in increasing awareness of the environmental importance of native plant communities. Unfortunately, most of the landscaping plants available in nurseries are from other parts of the world. These exotic plants not only sever the food web, but many have become invasive pests, outcompeting native species and degrading habitat in remaining natural areas. Native plants are adapted to local environmental conditions and, once established, they don’t require additional water, fertilizers, or frequent maintenance. Wild Ones connects people and native plants for a healthy planet. Wild Ones South Bend Chapter chartered in October of 2021, and works to fulfill its mission through education, advocacy and collaboration. For information on plant presale offerings and ecological groups that will be at sale, visit their website: [southbend.wildones.org](http://southbend.wildones.org/).
