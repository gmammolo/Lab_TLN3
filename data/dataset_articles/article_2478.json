  "text": "Murder trial of Bend man accused of fatally assaulting his mother delayed until July\nBEND, Ore. (KTVZ) – The murder trial of a Bend man accused of fatally assaulting his mother just over a year ago has been delayed for three months, until July, at his attorney’s request.\nDeschutes County Circuit Judge Alycia Herriott on Wednesday set a July 22 trial date for Joshua Lawrence Smith, 41, on a second-degree murder charge in the March 20, 2024 killing of Janice Marie Smith, 59, at the Legacy Landing Apartments in northeast Bend.\nA scheduled April 22 jury trial was canceled after defense attorney Raun Atkinson filed a motion saying they needed more time to prepare for trial and review recently provided evidence in the case.\nThat includes nearly a year’s worth of jail correspondence by Smith, who appeared by video at Wednesday’s hearingand remains held without bail. Atkinson also noted his own health issues and co-counsel’s recent family leave.\nDistrict Attorney Steve Gunnels told KTVZ News last year that Smith’s mother died of blunt force trauma after a “violent physical interaction” between the mother and son. Smith pleaded not guilty to the charge last August.\nHerriott also set a one-day hearing on pre-trial motions for May 23 and a trial readiness hearing for July 15.",
