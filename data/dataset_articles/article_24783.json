  "text": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) are here to stay, and no one can argue that! My current connection to the e-mobility field is so strong that sometimes I cannot believe it. I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia, where I earned my bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and took my first steps into the world of science. Later, I moved to Brazil to pursue both my master’s and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering, followed by a postdoc where I worked on two R&D projects focused on microgrids and e-mobility. At that point, I couldn’t have fully imagined the rapid pace at which EVs would be adopted, especially in Europe. The reality in South America is quite different, so when I moved to Portugal to collaborate as a postdoctoral researcher on the EV4EU (Electric Vehicles Management for Carbon Neutrality) project, it was a truly eye-opening experience. I am continuously amazed by the current advancements in e-mobility and incredibly excited about the future, as society embraces this transformative revolution in transportation. In Europe, the pressing need to confront climate change has driven the rise of policies supporting the decarbonisation target. As a result, we are seeing a massive surge in electric vehicles, for instance, last year the EV stock achieved approximately 330 million vehicles. The European Union has also set ambitious goals to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), with many countries planning to ban ICEV sales by 2035. As a researcher in this field, the rapid growth of EVs, to the point where we may no longer see a single gas-powered car on the roads by 2035, raises many questions. How will we prepare communities, as well as our electrical and transportation systems, for such a significant shift? How will we ensure that so many users can be accommodated comfortably? Will people feel as comfortable accessing charging points as they do with refuelling gas-powered cars practically, efficiently, and affordably? Will all European countries experience the same impact, or will the distinct energy mix of each nation determine how sustainably they can support this increase in EVs? In fact, there are far too many questions to address. The exciting part is that, as a member of the research team for the EV4EU project, I have the chance to actively contribute to finding solutions to these challenges. Our research focuses on developing management strategies for EVs to achieve carbon neutrality involved four European countries: Denmark, Greece, Portugal, and Slovenia. Quite impressive, wouldn’t you agree? Our project began with an initial important goal: to define future scenarios for e-mobility, considering fully electric vehicles, hybrids, and fuel-cell electric vehicles across the four countries involved, while considering the time horizons of 2030, 2040, and 2050. This required significant teamwork and research, as we had to analyse each country's targets, technical reports, current landscape, and policies supporting the adoption of EVs, among other factors. This research provided us with valuable insights into the massive growth of EVs in each of the participating countries. For my research, which focuses on the impact of EVs on the power system, and particularly as a collaborator on the EV4EU project, having access to and analysing this data was incredibly interesting. The results, which can be consulted in our paper: Dataset on Electric Road Mobility: Historical and Evolution Scenarios until 2050, showed that countries such as Portugal and Denmark are making significant progress in deploying fast chargers, other regions are lagging, making it difficult to support the anticipated growth in EVs. Additionally, the high cost of EVs remains a barrier to its widespread adoption, particularly in developing nations where government incentives and infrastructure are still limited. As a researcher, access to data is extremely important, because of our research the data can be consulted in the repository in https://zenodo.org/records/10443418 . Hence, my work, which focuses on how to manage EVs within the energy system to prevent them from becoming a burden, especially with so many on the roads, relies heavily on this. Having information on the number of EVs we can expect in the coming years has allowed me to analyse in greater detail how we can handle the EV mass adoption, ensuring they become an integral part of our everyday lives without compromising our comfort. Even better, it has helped explore ways to leverage their potential advantages. Mainly because, as EV adoption accelerates, managing the increased demand for electricity while ensuring that it comes from renewable sources, will be crucial. Without a parallel transition to green energy, the carbon benefits of e-mobility could be undermined, especially if coal and natural gas remain dominant in power generation. Outlook for the Future I am truly excited about the future of e-mobility, which presents both great promise and significant challenges. EV growth projections and the strides made in technological innovation, indicate that the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 is achievable. However, this transition will require sustained global efforts, particularly in the development of charging infrastructure, battery technology, and renewable energy integration. Countries like Denmark and Portugal, which have embraced aggressive EV policies, can serve as models for other nations working to accelerate their transition to e-mobility. Ultimately, the road to carbon neutrality will not be possible without collective action between governments, industries, and consumers. While the path ahead is complex, continued investment in research and development and international cooperation will be critical in overcoming the challenges that remain. As e-mobility becomes a reality, our community will need to remain committed to addressing the environmental, economic, and technological hurdles on the path to a sustainable and carbon-neutral future. As we move toward a greener future, investing in infrastructure and smart energy solutions is essential to power the future of mobility. Let's stay ahead of the curve! 🌍💡 #EV4EU, #EMobility #PowerGrid #SustainableEnergy #EVCharging",
