  "text": "Peregrine falcons have called the ledge on the 35th floor of 367 Collins Street home for more than three decades. They became a viral sensation during the COVID-19 pandemic when a livestream was set up for fans to watch the daily antics of the raptors.\nThey’ve amassed a loyal following of 50,000 who have joined the Facebook group, appropriately titled ‘Falcon Watchers’, to commentate the falcons’ every move.\nLast year’s eggs were unable to hatch after the mother stopped incubating, making this year’s breeding season all the more suspenseful for viewers.\nThe 24-hour livestream was set up again in August after the eggs appeared on the Collins Street rooftop last month.\nSpeaking on the extraordinary footage of the falcons, Holly Parsons, manager of priority sites at BirdLife Australia, said, “I don’t think we realise how lucky we are – it’s really quite extraordinary,” she said.\n“We tend to build our cities in high biodiversity hotspots – so creating spaces [like 367 Collins] where we can share with wildlife is important.\n“It provides them with a home, but there’s also more research coming out about the benefits of connecting with nature. It’s good for our wellbeing and it’s good for our health – the more opportunities we have, the better off we feel.”",
