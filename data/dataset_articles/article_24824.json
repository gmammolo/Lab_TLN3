  "text": "AMHERST, N.Y. — [2 On Your Side](/) has an update on the 171-acre [Amherst Central Park project](https://www.amherst.ny.us/content/projects.php?dept_id=dept_15&proj_id=proj_18&neworder=00). Plans are moving forward after [two cultural components are no longer part of it](/article/news/local/amherst-residents-submit-signatures-townwide-vote/71-009eca61-7de9-4820-98c4-5152cdfeff44). The plan is to get shovels in the ground next spring to transform the old Westwood Country Club into a massive town park. Sitting between Sheridan Drive and Maple Road, the future Amherst Central Park will be a mix of greenspace, playgrounds, ponds, wetlands, and more. \"It's meant to be open similar to Delaware Park or Central Park in New York. The idea is that it's non-confining. It's not a single use. It's not an athletic complex, but it really is meant to be the heart of the Town of Amherst,\" Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa told 2 On Your Side. 2 On Your Side got an update Thursday afternoon on what's happening since MusicalFare Theatre left the project. Kulpa says there were bond challenges and the timing just didn't work out for the theater. \"Fell out of their timing sequence and decided that they didn't want to wait nor put together a new deal,\" Kulpa said. A State Supreme Court decision made it so the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village could no longer relocate to the park because the animals wouldn't be allowed. So where do the plans stand now? The town supervisor told us it would be a tranquil space at the park and that the athletic complexes would go in other parts of the town. \"We have funding from the State Assembly for an inclusive playground, for a splash pad from Senator Ryan. We're moving forward with taking the southeast corner and developing, redoing the parking lots, developing a place for people, and we have a commitment from the county to move ahead with winter markets, and so we're going to continue to build on that idea,\" Kulpa said. \"Do you search for new culturals to move in? Or if somebody approached you, would you guys be open to it?\" Kelly Dudzik asked. \"Yeah, of course we're open. You know, we've heard a lot of ideas for this park over the years,\" Kulpa said. \"Including cultural community gardens, including natural playgrounds and play spaces, and including possibly another center for an outdoor amphitheater facility.\" And you might be wondering about the old clubhouse. It is still there, and the town plans on reusing it for the park.",
