  "text": "On ancient land, cracked and fissured by the ages and draped with just a veil of nutrient-poor soil, our Australian wildflowers demonstrate just how resilient, unique and extraordinary they are.\nSpringtime at the Muogamarra Nature Reserve, north of Sydney, is truly special. The native bush is bejewelled with flowers in dazzling colours and shapes not seen anywhere else in the world.\nThere are waratahs, angophoras, banksias, pink boronias and native orchids in abundance. Muogamarra also protects precious Aboriginal rock engravings and is home to echidnas, lyrebirds and other curious creatures. Wild things.- they make your heart sing!\nA visit to Muogamarra Nature Reserve, just north of Sydney, will have you marvelling at how our native vegetation can grow and thrive on so little soil.\nIt is closed most of the year to protect the fragile ecosystem and Indigenous cultural heritage. This nature reserve opens in spring annually for just six weeks. It has several walks, ranging from 1km to 10km, guided or unguided. Bookings are essential, and it can cost from $10-$55. For more information, head to\nVisit Muogomarra Nature Reserve[National Parks NSW].\n8 native wildflowers you’ll see in Muogamarra Nature Reserve\n01\nMountain devil\nLambertia formosa\nYou’ll attract pollinators and wildlife to your garden with the little mountain devil (Lambertia formosa). The flowers are brimful of nectar and the slightly spiky leaves provide cover for wildlife fleeing cats. It gets its unflattering moniker from the woody seed pods that look like a devil’s face.\n02\nNSW waratah\nTelopea speciosissima\nThink of the worst conditions to grow a flowering tree – shade and low-nutrient soil – and the spectacular NSW waratah will rise to the occasion.\n03\nWax flower\nEriostemon australasius\nPlant the pretty wax flower (Eriostemon australasius), with its profuse sprays of pink blooms, in a cottage garden, on the coast, or in a pot on a slightly shady balcony.\n04\nPink spider\nGrevillea sericea\nYou’ll see pink spider flowers (Grevillea sericea) in spring and they stay well into summer.\n05\nHairpin banksia\nB. spinulosa\nOne of the easiest native flowering plants to grow, the hairpin banksia (B. spinulosa) tolerates frost and seaspray. Its psychedelic lemon and orange blooms emerge in winter and last until spring.\n06\nBoronia\nBoronia\nThe tiny flowers of the boronia bush pack a punch of colour, and their leaves produce an exquisite, citrusy perfume. Plant it near an open door or window.\n07\nDrumsticks\nIsopogon anethifolius\nA brilliant example of Australia’s weird and wonderful wildflowers is drumsticks (Isopogon anethifolius). Try mass planting them.\n08\nJuniper wattle\nAcacia ulicifolia\nThe prickly foliage of juniper wattle (Acacia ulicifolia) gives cover to wildlife.",
