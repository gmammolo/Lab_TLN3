The project covers 57,752 square metres, including a park, a square and a balancing reservoir, a system of playgrounds and sports areas equipped with outdoor exercise equipment, walking paths, parking lots, flower gardens and fountains. The lack of public and recreational spaces for residents has always been a burning issue in Hanoi. The city plans to invest VND15.08 trillion (USD612 million) in upgrading 30 local parks in the 2024-2026 period. Of this sum, VND408 billion will be used to renovate Thong Nhat Park. Thu Le Park and Hanoi Botanical Garden will receive VND330 billion and VND149 billion, respectively. The project covers 57,752 square metres, including a park, a square and a balancing reservoir, a system of playgrounds and sports areas equipped with outdoor exercise equipment, walking paths, parking lots, flower gardens and fountains.
