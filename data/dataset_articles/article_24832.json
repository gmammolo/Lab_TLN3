It’ll have to beat legal challenges to get there. 3 October 2024\nLink copied to clipboard South Fork Wind Farm, off the coast of Long Island, NY. (Steve Pfost/Newsday RM via Getty Images) Federal regulators gave a huge, contentious offshore wind project the green light to start construction off the coast of New Jersey.\nOwned by Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind , a 50 - 50 venture by Shell and EDF Renewables , the project received approval of air permits from the Environmental Protection Agency and of construction and operation permits from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management on Tuesday.\nThe developer plans to install a total of about 200 wind turbines in federally owned waters between 10 and 20 miles off the Jersey shore. It’s also working with utilities to build several offshore substations and two undersea transmission lines that will connect the project to the grid near Atlantic City and farther north in Monmouth County, New Jersey.\nConstruction on phase one of the recently approved project, known as Atlantic Shores South, is set to begin in 2025 , and it could start sending power to the grid in 2028 or 2029 , according to the developer. The second phase of the project was also approved, but there is no timeline for its construction yet.\nIf completed as planned, the project’s two phases will be able to deliver a total of 2 . 8 gigawatts of electricity to the grid, making it one of the largest clean energy projects in America. It will also be the first offshore wind array for New Jersey, a state banking on the power source in order to hit its clean energy goals.\nMany East Coast states have limited land for wind and solar installations, so offshore wind is an attractive pathway for them to decarbonize. Its importance has been recognized at a federal level too: The Biden administration aims for the U.S. to build 30 gigawatts offshore wind capacity by 2030 .\nBut the sector has hit a rough patch in recent years , and only about one-quarter of a gigawatt of offshore wind is installed today.\nProjects up and down the East Coast have been canceled or delayed, in large part because of inflation, high interest rates, and slow-moving supply chains — all factors that contributed to the cancellation of a pair of New Jersey projects , planned by Danish energy giant Ørsted , last year. Offshore wind projects are also prone to delays given the extensive permitting process that spans various federal and state agencies. And even after projects clear the regulatory hurdles, lawsuits from opponents can still slow down or stop developments.\nGet Caught Up",
