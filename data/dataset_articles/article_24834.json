  "text": "The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has completed the removal of over 6156.94 metric tonnes (MT) of silt and construction and demolition waste from the capital in the last 10 days, according to officials. Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena in a review meeting held on September 20 directed the authorities to launch an anti-dust drive, which was to be converted into a year-long campaign. He had advised the road-owning agencies mainly the MCD and Public Works Department (PWD) to clear the dust from roads, take measures to avoid letting it settle and transport it to designated dumping sites. Authorities such as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Irrigation and Flood Control Department (IFCD), and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) were directed to coordinate in removing silt. In 12 MCD Zones, 404.65 MT of waste was removed on September 24 and by Wednesday the officials managed to clear 6156.94 MT of waste. As per the officials, the Shahdara South Zone made the most significant progress in the waste removal drive by clearing 1230.76 MT in the last 10 days, followed by Keshavpuram Zone that removed 1019.67 MT of waste. The silt will be transported to designated dumping sites for proper disposal and bioremediation, said the civic body. Earlier, the L-G's office had said that the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi are road dust and dried up mud or silt accumulated on roads.",
