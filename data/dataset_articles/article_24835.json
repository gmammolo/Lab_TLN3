  "text": "By WV Daily News ,\n1 hours ago SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WVDN) — Gov. Jim Justice announced today that the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) has reported the state’s ninth record catch of the year — a blue catfish reeled in by an Indiana angler on the Ohio River in September.\n“With record-breaking catch after record-breaking catch, it’s no surprise that West Virginia’s world-class fishing continues to attract anglers from all over,” said Gov. Jim Justice. “I want to congratulate Kimberly Feltner on this amazing catch. It’s yet another example of why folks love coming to West Virginia to fish.”\nKimberly Feltner of Madison, Ind., caught the 50.82-inch, 64.15-pound blue catfish at the R.C. Byrd Pool on the Ohio River using cut mooneye bait. She was accompanied by local fishing guide Chris Souders. WVDNR Apple Grove Hatchery Manager Ryan Bosserman certified the record-breaking catch. Feltner’s catch surpasses the previous length record of 50.7 inches set by Steven Price in 2022. The weight record (69.45 pounds) is still held by Michael John Drake of St. Albans, W.Va.\n“Anglers have broken West Virginia’s blue catfish record multiple times over the last few years, which is a testament to the successful management efforts we’ve implemented,” said WVDNR Director Brett McMillion. “We’re excited to see what other records might be broken as resident and non-resident anglers continue to hear about our waters consistently producing trophy fish.”\nWith this catch, the WVDNR has reported nine record-breaking catches so far in 2024. In August, two anglers fishing together at Woodrum Lake in Jackson County each caught record-breaking black crappie . In July, an angler landed a record-breaking channel catfish in Wayne County. In June, anglers caught a record-breaking black crappie and redear sunfish at Woodrum Lake in Jackson County and Plum Orchard Lake in Fayette County, respectively. In March, an angler caught a record-breaking bowfin on the Ohio River in Mason County. In February, anglers caught record-breaking redbreast sunfish and tiger trout at New Creek Lake in Grant County.

Anglers are reminded that a trout stamp is required when fishing for trout. They are also encouraged to upgrade their fishing experience by opting for a physical license card when they purchase their 2024 fishing license.\nThe post Justice announces record blue catfish on the Ohio River appeared first on West Virginia Daily News .\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
