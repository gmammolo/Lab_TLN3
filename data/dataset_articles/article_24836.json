  "text": "GHENT — The county’s Soil and Water Conservation District received $2.8 million from the state to work with a local dairy farm to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The funding, announced Sept. 27 by Gov. Kathy Hochul, is part of $33 million in funding awarded to 70 county soil and water conservation districts across the state. This was the first time the county’s district was awarded funding through the state’s Climate Resilient Farming Grant Program, Dylan Cipkowski, executive director of the Columbia County Soil and Water Conservation District, said. “We’re very excited about that, we have applied for this funding in the past and have not been awarded it,” he said. “This is the first time an award has gone to a Columbia County farm.” The district received the funding and is working with an unnamed local dairy farm. The Soil and Water Conservation District submitted the application to the grant program on behalf of a dairy farm in the county, which Cipkowski could not name due to privacy reasons. “The farm was really instrumental in putting together a complete application,” he said. The project the farm and the district will be undertaking involves the implementation of a manure management system, which includes two covered manure systems. The management system will include a cover and flare system, which is made up of a covered manure pit where the methane is captured and burned off to prevent it from entering the environment. The system will also use a solid-liquid separation mechanism to separate the manure for the creation of bedding material for the cows, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets’ description of the project. “These storages will result in eliminating methane emissions from manure stored on the farm, significantly improved odors on and around the farm, as well as a number of farm efficiencies that will make the farm more viable,” Cipkowski said. Covering the manure systems on the farm will also reduce rainwater from entering the systems, which will require the farm to truck away manure less often, Cipkowski said. “That’s less fuel the farm needs to buy, less hired help the farm requires,” he said. The farm will also be able to recycle fiber used for cow bedding through the management system, which the farm currently has to truck in from out of state, Cipkowski said. “Having this production on the farm will reduce the need to truck in the material and provide cost savings for the farm,” he said. The total cost of the project is $5.8 million, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets’ description of the project. The farm has to match 50% or more of the project cost, Cipkowski said. Through the implementation of the farm’s manure management system, the estimated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is 30,440 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets. The Columbia County project will result in the highest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions out of the 70 projects awarded funding. The county Soil and Water Conservation district also received the largest amount of funding from the state for the its project. The goal of the Climate Resilient Farming Grant program is to assist farmers in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as protect water, ensure soil health, and increase the resiliency of farms against climate change, according to a written statement from Hochul’s office. “We’re really excited to be awarded the funding for the project and think it really fits the goals of the program,” Cipkowski said. Matt Murell, chairman of the Columbia County Board of Supervisors, R-Stockport, welcomed the funding for the project. “We’re happy to receive any state funding that’s going to benefit our farm community,” he said.",
