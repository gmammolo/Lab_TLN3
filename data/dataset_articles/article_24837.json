  "text": "After our brief Thursday cool down another round of unseasonably warm temperatures are on the way. Thursday's high temperature at Denver International Airport pushed only to 70 degrees. A warmer pattern will begin on Friday boosting the highs above normal and increasing the Fire Danger for much of eastern Colorado.For Friday winds in some of the northern Colorado mountains will kick up to 35 mph with humidity levels 10 % or less. This will create critical fire danger for areas of Jackson, Grand and Larimer Counties on Friday afternoon.Then on Saturday, downslope winds will be stronger along, with more heat across the northern Colorado mtns and foothills down into the eastern plains. A Fire Weather Watch is in place for the elevated danger.The warm up should be enough to get Denver another record high temperature to start the weekend. The old record is 86 and the forecast high is 87 to 88 degrees.",
