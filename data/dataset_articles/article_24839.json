  "text": "Indian Forest Services Officer Susanta Nanda often shares captivating and breathtaking photos of wildlife. In his latest video, the officer captures a majestic and rare black tiger on a DSLR camera. This is the first video of the rare melanistic tiger from the Similipal Tiger Reserve in Odisha. In the video, it can be seen roaming freely amid the wild. Melanistic tigers are a rare variant of the tiger species that have elevated levels of melanin. This makes them look much darker than usual. Melanistic tigers tend to have thicker and darker stripes than usual and at times may appear almost black in certain lighting. The now viral footage gives us a rare glimpse of these majestic and unique felines and their lives. Watch the viral video below.
