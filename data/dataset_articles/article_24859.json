  "text": "A powerful partnership between the Hillcrest Aids Centre Trust and The Litterboom Project highlighted the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems and the opportunities for creating sustainable livelihoods through waste recycling and repurposing.\nHillcrest, South Africa (02 October 2024) – Two awesome organisations came together for a powerful partnership for a greener tomorrow.\nHillcrest AIDS Centre Trust (HACT) welcomed The Litterboom Project , South Africa’s largest river cleanup initiative, for a thought-provoking talk on environmental protection.\nTheir presentation focused on the importance of keeping rivers clean to protect marine ecosystems as well as creating opportunities for youth to become WastePreneurs.\nLitterboom Wastepreneur Njabulo gave a short talk on recycling and the waste problem. He shared insights on how to identify recyclable and non-recyclable items, empowering everyone to make better choices when it comes to managing waste.\nThe session, attended by HACT staff, volunteers, youth interns, and Indalo Agri-Entrepreneur trainees, highlighted the far-reaching benefits of waste reduction.\n“Keeping our rivers clean not only helps prevent harmful plastic from devastating our oceans but also provides a pathway for sustainable livelihoods within our communities.\n“Litterboom’s mission aligns closely with our values of empowerment, environmental stewardship, and community development,” HACT said .\nHACT reiterated the need to protect waterways, as a way of safeguarding not only the environment but also the health and future of those who depend on it.\n“As we work together to create cleaner rivers, we are investing in a healthier, more sustainable future for generations to come,” HACT added.\nInspired by HACT’s innovative upcycling efforts, The Litterboom team also discovered new possibilities for transforming plastic waste into valuable products.\nMany of HACT’s volunteers and staff have successfully repurposed plastic into high-quality items to sell locally, demonstrating the potential for sustainable livelihoods.\n“This is one of the many ways we’re working to support reclaimers, empower our communities, and reduce plastic pollution,” The Litterboom Project shared.\nBy working together, HACT and Litterboom are taking significant steps towards a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future for generations to come.",
