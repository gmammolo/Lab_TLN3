Luke Pollard said the the new Labour Government is \"looking\" at changing the Dartmoor policy inherited from the previous Government.\nHe said the previous Government refused to heed concerns about how the design of their farming policies were preventing farmers and landowners from obtaining funding to support the semi-wild pony population in the National Park.\nNew farm support payments were not due to activate for farmers on moorland commons until 2025. Dartmoor&apos;s ponies are technically owned by farmers and once a year are \"drifted\" and checked over before returning to the moor. Not all animals will return, with some then listed for sale.\nMr Pollard, who is MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport , said this had resulted in fears of a cull of Dartmoor Hill Ponies following this year&apos;s pony drift.\nHowever earlier this year Natural England moved to allay those concerns, telling Devon Live : \"Natural England has not called for a cull of Dartmoor Hill Ponies.\"\nThe Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) launched a petition earlier this year to \"save\" the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, which now has over 100,000 signatures. It said it was concerned that an independent review would lead to a decline in pony numbers.\nThe DHPA says the breeds are considered genetically rare and has warned that pony numbers have dropped from 7,000 to 900 over the last 25 years. The ponies are only found on the upland commons of Dartmoor, which are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and are known to have roamed Dartmoor since the bronze age.\nMr Pollard, speaking after discussions with ministers and campaigners, said: \"Ponies on the moor are an unforgettable hallmark of Dartmoor. It’s clear we need to take steps to protect this special breed, and I’ve been pleased to support campaigners on this issue. With the annual pony drift underway, numbers could be reduced because of the lack of support.\n\"That means a cull of Dartmoor Hill Ponies well beyond a reasonable measure to control numbers. I&apos;ve spoken to ministers and groups involved in protection of ponies on Dartmoor and I&apos;m cautiously optimistic that a way of averting a cull this year has been found.\"\nCharlotte Faulkner, chair of the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association, said: \"The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association would like to thank the Farming Minister, Devon MPs and Natural England for their focus and speedy action to ensure numbers of semi-wild Dartmoor Hill Pony mares and stallions have not been reduced this drift time.\n\"We look forward to continuing to work with Defra and Natural England to make sure farming and environmental policy supports these rare and endangered ponies, which are such an iconic and loved sight on Dartmoor.\"\nCouncillor Charlotte Holloway added: \"I’m delighted that Labour Ministers have listened to concerns of key groups across Dartmoor as well as residents across Devon who do not want to see a reduction in pony numbers. Dartmoor Hill Ponies are part of the special natural heritage we have on our doorstep in this part of the world, and we want this genetically rare breed to be enjoyed for generations to come.\"\nClick here to join PlymouthLive on WhatsApp and we&apos;ll send breaking news and top stories directly to your phone.
