Celebrating World Animal Day October 4, 2024 – In honor of World Animal Day, World Animal Protection is thrilled to announce the [2024 Wild Animal Unique Personality Award finalists](/our-campaigns/wildlife/innovative-solutions/wild-animal-unique-personality-award/2024/). This [prestigious award](/our-campaigns/wildlife/innovative-solutions/wild-animal-unique-personality-award/) celebrates the extraordinary personalities of wild animals and the venues that protect them from commercial exploitation. Honoring these remarkable [sentient beings](/our-campaigns/sentience/) reminds us that every animal is more than just a number and can't be treated as a commodity. How the shortlist is decided Each chosen venue focuses on various efforts, including conserving endangered and critically endangered native species, rehabilitating and reintroducing animals into the wild when possible, or offering the best possible life to those who can’t return to the wild. Additionally, they rescue animals from illegal trafficking, the entertainment industry, or the pet trade. Audrey Mealia The Wild Animal Unique Personality Award is dedicated to [Audrey Mealia](/latest/news/remembering-our-dear-colleague-audrey-mealia/), a beloved and respected member of World Animal Protection’s wildlife team who passed away in 2021. This award honors her commitment to protecting animals from commercial exploitation and aims to inspire other and relevant facilities worldwide to improve animal care practices for wild animals while educating the public about the importance of maintaining high animal welfare standards. Award Selection and Prize The winner will be awarded a one-time prize of USD 10,000 to enhance the care and protection of wild animals at their facility. Finalists are selected based on criteria ensuring that the animals’ behaviors and traits are natural, not developed through training or negatively impacted by captivity. Additionally, the venue must adhere to responsible tourism standards, prohibiting direct contact with wild animals, selfies, or animal entertainment. Enclosures must also be suitable for the species and meet their individual physiological and behavioral needs. Starting today, on [World Animal Day](/our-campaigns/sentience/animal-awareness-days/world-animal-day/), the public can cast their votes for their favorite finalist.
