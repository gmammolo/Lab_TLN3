  "text": "The feline was found in poor health conditions, and it is undergoing treatment at the El Centenario Zoo.\nAgents of the Yucatan State Police seized an African lion cub that was seen while its alleged owners were “walking” it through the streets of Merida.\nAfter realizing that the animal was in poor physical condition, the officers handed it over to the environmental authorities for safekeeping.\nThe cub, approximately two months old, was transferred to the El Centenario Zoo of the Merida City Council, where specialists are in charge of treating its wounds and helping it regain weight and health.\nVeterinarian Rosa Reyes Valle, an expert in the care of felines at the zoo, explained that the lion arrived with lacerations on its nose and legs, skin problems, and scars, probably caused by having lived in a small, humid space with poor hygiene conditions.\n“He is currently undergoing treatment with medicated baths and ointment for the laceration on his nose, which is still active. He also has alopecia on his forehead, ears, and limbs, probably caused by a mycosis,” the veterinarian explained.\nThe staff of the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (Profepa) has shown interest in the cub remaining at the zoo, but this will depend on his evolution and recovery in the coming months.\nIn a gesture that seeks to integrate the community into the story of this rescued feline, the authorities of Mérida launched a call for citizens to propose a name for the lion through social networks. The winning name will be chosen according to the number of “likes” it obtains, and the citizen who suggests the selected name will be awarded a special prize.\nThis call has generated an enthusiastic response, and the authorities hope that the contest will contribute to raising awareness about the care of animals and the importance of ensuring their well-being.\nTYT Newsroom",
