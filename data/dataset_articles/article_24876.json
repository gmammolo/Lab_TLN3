  "text": "Adelaide Escapes: Little Dip Conservation Park Small in size, but Little Dip has plenty of great outdoor locations 4 Oct 2024, 02:34 pm Share Facebook Twitter Email Copy Link Justin Walker Gallery 6 The quaint coastal township of Robe , 335km southeast of Adelaide, belies its underwhelming appearance by acting as a gateway to the Limestone Coast, one of Australia’s most spectacular environments. As the Limestone Coast name suggests, the coastline here is dramatic; craggy rocky cliffs, sea caves and more dot this part of the coast, linked together by sweeping beaches abutting the waters of the Upper South East Marine Park. The beaches around Robe are also renowned as top-notch surfing destinations.\nThis part of South Australia offers not only said spectacle in terms of the coastal/hinterland landscape, but truckloads of outdoor activities – fishing, 4x4 touring, hiking, kayaking, swimming, surfing and camping – with most of these located within the boundaries of Little Dip Conservation Park, around two kilometres south of Robe (if accessing the park through its northern boundary).\nExplore SA\nBest 4x4 tracks near Adelaide You don't have to venture far from the City of Churches to find touring gold\n4 Oct 2024 For those keen on checking out the park’s southern section, you can follow Nora Creina Road southeast out of Robe and enter the park near Long Gully Campground. The conservation park is named after one of its beaches – Little Dip Beach – and contains four campgrounds.\nFor those lugging a camper trailer, the Long Gully campground offers the best access as it (unlike its moniker) is a wide, flat area of ground with plenty of site space. This area also provides more protection from coastal winds as it’s about one kilometre from the beach. You can drive the sand tracks from here through sand dunes to the beach, but don’t forget to drop tyre pressures accordingly.\nThe other three campgrounds – The Gums, Old Man Lake and Stony Rise – are more compact but closer to the surf and offer the bonus of more shaded sites (The Gums and Stony Rise are found in the park’s northern section; Old Man Lake and Long Gully are in the south).",
