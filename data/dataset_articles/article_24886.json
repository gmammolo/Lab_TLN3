  "text": "The Melanesian Youth Climate Corps (MYCC) was officially launched Thursday in Suva, Fiji, focused on enabling Melanesian youth to step up as leaders in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction.\nDeveloped under the USAID-funded Climate Smart & Disaster Ready Program and spanning across Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea, the MYCC fellowship offers core climate training, specialised study tracks, and hands-on internships or practicums, providing youth with the skills needed to build more resilient communities.\nEtuate Bari, Divisional Manager Central at the Ministry of Youth and Sports, officiated the launch, emphasizing the critical role of youth in disaster resilience.\n“Our youth, though not always formal responders, often step up during the aftermath of disasters, providing vital community support. Their involvement in recovery is critical, and with the right training, they can become essential contributors to disaster resilience,” said Etuate Bari.\n“… the MYCC places a strong emphasis on including youth from diverse, maritime and rural communities—areas most vulnerable to climate impacts. These communities also hold invaluable indigenous and local knowledge developed over centuries, and the MYCC ensures that such wisdom is integrated and captured into its curriculum, which is critical for climate resilience work,” said Bari.\nMinister Saukuru also highlighted the alignment of the MYCC with Fiji’s National Youth Policy 2023-2027, stressing the program’s role in addressing the skills gap in climate resilience and disaster preparedness.\n“The MYCC supports our vision by offering core training in climate adaptation, specialized study tracks with local institutes, and internships and practicums. By linking education with real-world opportunities in high-demand sectors, particularly those now critical due to the climate emergency, the program creates pathways for youth who might otherwise lack access to formal education or employment.”\nMichael Glees, USAID Pacific Islands Deputy Mission Director emphasized USAID’s commitment to supporting Pacific youth as they lead the region toward greater climate resilience.\n“USAID is committed to supporting the next generation of climate leaders across Melanesia. Our youth hold the key to building resilient communities, and this program provides the platform for them to gain the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to lead the way,” said Glees.\n“By investing in young people, we are investing in the future sustainability of the Pacific region, he said”\nMartin Child, Programme Director for the MYCC, highlighted the program’s commitment to inclusivity and regional collaboration.\n“Our Fellowship Programme strives to ensure that youth from diverse backgrounds, particularly those from remote and maritime communities, as well as those with disabilities have access to the training and development opportunities they need to thrive,” said Martin.\n“We believe that climate resilience requires the involvement of all youth, and MYCC is dedicated to removing the barriers that prevent participation,” he said.\n“Through financial support offered throughout the Fellowship, our programme ensures that these young leaders are fully equipped to contribute and succeed, regardless of their circumstances.”\nThe MYCC has established advisory groups, beginning with the Fiji Advisory Board, composed of youth leaders as well as a few seasoned climate leaders and educators to ensure the program remains inclusive and community driven. The same approach will be extended to Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea beginning in 2025.\nThe launch was attended by more than sixty guests including representatives from government, development agencies, and youth groups. The event also featured a live climate song performance by Ron Simpson, along with the climate advocacy song “Roots” by Mia Kami, performed by the Mata Dance Group—highlighting the powerful role that music and culture play in Pacific climate advocacy.\nThe MYCC is now accepting applications for its first cohort of youth leaders. With the long-term goal of building sustainability across Melanesian communities, the MYCC aims to prepare a new generation of leaders who are ready to meet the challenges of a changing climate….PACNEWS/USAID/MYCC",
