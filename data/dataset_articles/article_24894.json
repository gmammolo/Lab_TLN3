  "text": "Faucet Water (File) PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. – Good news for most residents of Pinellas County’s southern barrier islands: Pinellas County Utilities has lifted the boil water advisory for St. Pete Beach, Treasure Island, and Tierra Verde. Water quality tests confirm that the water in these areas now meets all safety standards.\nThe advisory was issued after Hurricane Helene damaged the area’s water system. While most areas have recovered, Sunset Beach on Treasure Island remains without water due to sand and debris covering service valves.\nRead: St. Petersburg’s Northeast Sewer Treatment Plant Back Online At Midnight\nAdditionally, approximately 450 properties in the southern barrier islands are experiencing water service interruptions due to damage on their private property. Pinellas County Utilities will be assisting these property owners in coordinating repairs with licensed plumbers.\nAlthough the boil water advisory has been lifted for most residents, Pinellas County Utilities is still asking everyone in the affected areas to conserve water as crews work to fully restore the sanitary sewer system.\nResidents with questions can contact Utilities Customer Service at (727) 464-4000 or visit disaster.pinellas.gov for the latest recovery information.\nPlease make a small donation to the Tampa Free Press to help sustain independent journalism .
