  "text": "A new art exhibit at La Nube is highlighting the importance of wildlife conservation efforts while also previewing a new statewide initiative that will bring desert bighorn sheep to the Borderland. \"Ram-arkable Resilience: Art meets Conservation\" recently opened at La Nube, and with it a challenge to confront the impact Borderland residents have on the local environment, as well as how they can support wildlife conservation movements. The work is a collaborative effort by Green Hope Project, La Nube STEAM Discovery Center, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), Socorro ISD and Ysleta ISD. As its name suggests, \"Ram-arkable Resilience\" riffs on the theme of rams -- or desert bighorn sheep -- that are made entirely out of recycled trash, including cardboard boxes, water bottles, newspaper, plastic forks and damaged fabric from one of La Nube's exhibits. The result is a stylized depiction of El Paso's Franklin Mountains, peppered with desert bighorn sheep traversing the peaks and valleys; a \"vision\" that the creators said \"may not be too far in the future.\" That's because later this year, TPWD plans to relocate some of the state's desert bighorn sheep from the Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area to Franklin Mountains State Park, in a bid to protect existing herds. RECOMMENDED: Experience the power of Italian opera in El Paso this October “We are excited to partner with the Green Hope Project. This initiative aligns with La Nube’s mission to ignite imagination and inspire guests to discover, create, and innovate by engaging the community in creative environmental stewardship through art and education,” said Norma Escandon, Early Childhood Coordinator for La Nube. “By highlighting the importance of preserving native wildlife, La Nube empowers visitors to become visionary thinkers and responsible changemakers for the natural world.” \"Ram-arkable Resilience: Art meets Conservation\" was created by students and art instructors from Parkland High School, Del Valle High School and Vista Del Sol Environmental Science Academy, as well as during La Nube workshops for children. The exhibition will be on display near La Nube's entrance until Nov. 2.
