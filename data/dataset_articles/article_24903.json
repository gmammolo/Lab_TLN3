  "text": "Uber has launched a strategic partnership with The Earthshot Prize Finalist, ENSO to roll out their range-extending and low-emission electric vehicle (EV) tires across the UK and USA. Uber has become a Founding Partner of The Earthshot Prize, founded by HRH Prince William, and will support the most innovative climate solutions. Deal launched in London – Uber’s global capital for electrification where almost 30% of Uber’s miles are fully electric. Uber has launched a strategic partnership with Earthshot Prize Finalist, ENSO to roll out its energy-efficient and low-emission EV tires across the UK and USA. The partnership is designed to support the tire technology company to grow internationally.\nEarthshot Prize Finalist, ENSO is a London-born tire technology company that makes high-performance EV tires that extend EV range and reduce tire pollution. As part of this three year strategic partnership, Uber and ENSO will offer thousands of drivers in the UK and USA access to specially discounted ENSO tires via a dedicated Buyer’s Club.\nLondon is Uber’s capital of electrification globally where almost 30% of Uber’s miles are now fully electric. The company has built up a £145 million Clean Air Fund to help drivers go electric in the city. Uber is the most widely available on-demand EV network in the world, providing millions of zero-emissions trips every month.\nENSO announced earlier this year that it is developing a $500 million carbon-neutral tire factory in the United States as part of its expansion. ENSO’s U.S. factory will be operational by 2027, directly employ over 600 people and produce more than five million EV tires per year.\nThe strategic partnership with ENSO is the first Uber has struck with an Earthshot Prize Finalist and part of a wider partnership with The Earthshot Prize, founded by HRH Prince William. As a new Founding Partner, Uber will nominate climate solution start-ups for The Earthshot Prize, an annual award worth £1 million given to five innovative climate solutions. Finalists will also receive mentorship and support from Uber engineers, as well as partnership opportunities.\nThis partnership with ENSO comes ahead of Uber’s second-annual climate event in London, GO-GET Zero, taking place on 8th October where Uber will introduce new features that make sustainable choices easier for drivers, consumers, and merchants.\nJill Hazelbaker, CMO and SVP, Communications & Public Policy at Uber, said: “Innovation is in Uber’s DNA and much more is needed to tackle the climate crisis. That’s why we’re partnering with The Earthshot Prize to offer Uber’s platform as a launchpad for groundbreaking solutions globally – especially those working to accelerate an all-electric future for our planet. We’re thrilled to work with ENSO to help them grow while making it easier for Uber drivers to go electric around the world.”\nGunnlaugur Erlendsson, Founder and CEO of ENSO, said: “The world needs electric vehicles. They help combat climate change and eliminate harmful tailpipe pollution. ENSO’s mission is to make EVs more successful, by extending their range while reducing the pollution from their tires. Our goal is to provide EV drivers with more affordable, energy-efficient, longer-lasting, and ultimately carbon-neutral tires. This helps Uber drivers save costs and earn more revenue every mile, all while reducing the impact of tires on the environment.”\nHannah Jones, CEO of The Earthshot Prize, said: “The Earthshot Prize spotlights climate solutions from around the world, helping speed them to scale to reach their potential and create true impact. We are proud that the partnership between Uber and 2023 Earthshot Finalist ENSO, with its groundbreaking solution in the transportation space, provides a perfect example of how the Prize can use its convening power to connect businesses with innovators to find new ways to address the challenges we collectively face.”\nUber is working to become a zero-emissions mobility platform globally by 2040 and in North America and Europe by 2030. Low and zero-emissions options are now available in more than 200 cities. EV rideshare drivers also deliver up to four times the emissions savings that a regular driver would.",
