  "text": "Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has assured residents of Bangkok that fears of flooding are unfounded, emphasising that current rainwater levels are significantly lower compared to the devastating 2011 floods. On Wednesday, Ms. Paetongtarn reviewed the water situation at the Royal Irrigation Department in Nonthaburi.\nIn 2011, Thailand faced the fury of five storms and saw a rainfall increase of over 25% beyond the average. In contrast, this year's figures show only a 2% rise above usual rainfall levels, and just one storm has struck. Major reservoirs still have room to retain water, unlike in 2011 when they reached capacity, forcing massive water releases.\n\"For those concerned about potential flooding in Bangkok , there is no need to worry. Bangkok will not be flooded,\" assured Ms. Paetongtarn.\nCurrently, rainfall in northern areas is contributing to water flow from the Ping, Wang, Yom, and Nan rivers into the Chao Phraya River. The Chao Phraya Dam in Chai Nat is releasing water at 1,899 cubic metres per second, a rate comfortably managed by current infrastructure.\nThe Water Resources Department is closely monitoring at the Bang Sai station to ensure flow rates remain under 3,000 cubic metres per second in Ayutthaya.\nLocal authorities are prepared, deploying drainage and pumping efforts to direct water efficiently to the Gulf of Thailand, managing a daily capacity of about 164 million cubic metres, reported Bangkok Post.\nLooking ahead, the Meteorological Department forecasts mixed weather, with possible storms and rainfall due to a cold front from China, affecting Bangkok, among other regions.\nMeanwhile, Jirayu Houngsub, a disaster relief spokesman, warned of potential overflow along Chiang Rai's Kok River due to expected heavy rains, potentially impacting 147 square kilometres across six districts.\nPicture courtesy: Thai Rath\n-- 2024-10-04",
