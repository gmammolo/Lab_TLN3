Addressing the valedictory session as the chief guest, Prof Arun Kumar Singh, Registrar, Banaras Hindu University highlighted the increasing frequency and intensity of climate change-induced weather events, which disproportionately impact developing and low-income countries, which are reliant on climate-sensitive resources. They are at heightened risk of poverty, inequality, food insecurity, and health crises caused by climate hazards, he added. The guest of honour, Prof. B.S. Chaudhury, Chairman, Department of Geophysics, Kurukshetra University, highlighted the urgent need for worldwide action to achieve a climate-resilient and sustainable world. He said that a comprehensive framework known as Climate Resilient Development (CRD) has been proposed, combining climate adaptation strategies with greenhouse gas emissions reduction to support sustainable development. The Dean, Faculty of Science, Prof. Sartaj Tabassum emphasized the significance of Climate Resilient Development Pathways (CRDP) in fostering sustainable development, poverty reduction, and inequality alleviation while also meeting adaptation and mitigation targets. Earlier, welcoming the guests, Prof Nizamuddin Khan, Chairman of the department and Convener of the programme highlighted the diversity of papers presented during the conference which addressed various climate-related issues faced in different regions of the world and especially in India.
