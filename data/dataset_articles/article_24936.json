  "text": "Cohen Williams says his job \"never gets old\". The seafarer aboard the merchant vessel Peregrine and his fellow crew were treated to a very special performance while off the coast of Burnie. Three whales appeared from under the dark and rough waters to say hello. \"We couldn't get into port due to weather conditions, so we were just drifting off the coast,\" he said. \"I just looked out my port hole and there was a whale ... it would have been no more than 10 metres off the starboard side of the ship. \"My friend, who's an officer on the bridge, said 'look off the starboard side' and then I heard [the crew] get all excited. \"So I raced up there and then they gave us a show for about 15 minutes, just going back and forth.\" He said one of the three whales even rolled over. \"And looked like it was getting a nice mouth full of maybe krill,\" Mr Williams said. Mr Williams, who has been a seafarer for 14 years, said his current vessel's run can get slightly repetitive, but it's moments like these that \"keeps it fresh\". \"You see things like that and it just tops it off,\" he said. \"Everyone was chuffed to see them, we're all up on the bridge having a gander, and everyone's recording.\" The dad of two just made the sea change from Victoria to Shearwater. He said \"it was the best move ever\".",
