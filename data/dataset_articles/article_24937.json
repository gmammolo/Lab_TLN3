  "text": "Survey Discovers New Reptile and Amphibian Species A survey of reptiles and amphibians, known as herpetofauna, was conducted in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), specifically in the Masinagudi Division, from September 7th to 9th, 2024. This survey discovered a large variety of species, with a total of 33 reptiles and 36 amphibians identified. Four of these species might even be completely new to science. Survey Overview The survey covered areas at different heights, ranging from 300 to 2,000 meters above sea level, across different types of habitats. It was led by Deputy Director Arun Kumar P., with guidance from Field Director D. Venkatesh. This was the first full study of herpetofauna in this part of the reserve, which made the findings even more exciting. Potential New Species Four new species were potentially discovered during the survey: - Two geckos: one from the Cnemaspis genus and another from the Hemidactylus genus. - One skink (a type of lizard). - One frog from the Sphaerotheca genus. These species will need more research to be officially confirmed as new, including taxonomic and molecular studies. This means scientists will need to analyze the collected specimens’ physical features and genetic material. Endangered Species The survey also found several endangered species, such as: - The cave dancing frog (Micrixalus spelunca). - Indraneil’s night frog (Nyctibatrachus indraneili). Other important species, like the striped coral snake (Calliophis nigrescens), the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), and the Nilgiri burrowing snake (Plectrurus perrotetii), were also observed. These species are either endangered or unique to the area, making their presence important for conservation. Ecological Importance The Masinagudi Division in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve is ecologically important because it includes a mix of forests and shrub jungles, creating a perfect environment for many different species. The area’s geography makes it a hotspot for biodiversity, meaning it supports a wide variety of plant and animal life. It’s also a key source of water for local wildlife and nearby human communities. More surveys are planned, especially during the upcoming monsoon season, to explore areas that are harder to reach and to focus on species that are active during dry periods. These future efforts will likely uncover even more species, adding to the understanding of the region’s wildlife. Conservation Implications The findings from this survey are very important for protecting the [wildlife](https://www.gktoday.in/2024-world-wildlife-crime-report/) in the area. With this new information, conservationists can develop better plans to manage the reserve and protect these species. Including previous studies, there are now 55 documented reptile species and 39 amphibian species in MTR, with around 40% being unique to the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot. Additionally, 16 species found in the reserve are considered threatened, emphasizing the need for continued conservation efforts.
