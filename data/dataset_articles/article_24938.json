  "text": "Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Awareness Campaign The U of A owns and maintains a natural gas pipeline that runs through the south side of campus. As part of its responsibilities in creating a safe and informed Fayetteville community, the U of A sent an annual notice out this week to key public officials around the city and Washington County this week. The pipeline was established in 2016 and significantly decreases the university's greenhouse gas footprint, which is a primary sustainability goal at the U of A. The notice included information about the pipeline, such as its exact location and its primary function, and also lists signs of a gas leak, how to identify them, and what to do if you are in the area of a gas leak. The information is consistent with the university's commitment to safety in all gas pipeline operations. In addition to notifying local officials, all addresses within 600 feet of the pipeline are sent materials to help bring awareness to proper protocols in the unlikely event of an incident. The university routinely participates in safety procedure exercises to prepare first responders in the case of a pipeline emergency. Contractors and excavators who work on campus are also taught damage prevention, leak recognition and response, and are required to call Arkansas One Call for the location of the line before doing any work on a property. Natural gas pipelines are typically very safe, and incidents are very rare. Members of campus should be aware of the following symptoms of a pipeline leak to ensure safety around the pipeline on campus: - Strong odor (gaseous, chemical or \"rotten eggs\") - Unusual hissing or roaring noise - Large sections of dead vegetation - Flames coming from the ground - A cloud of vapor, fog, or mist - Dirt blowing in the air If you detect a potential leak, leave the area and tell those around you to leave. Once you are a safe distance away, call 911. If you have any questions about the pipeline, you can call University Police at 479-575-2222.
