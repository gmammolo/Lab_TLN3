  "text": "A former Bergen County police officer was sentenced to 11 years in prison for fatally shooting his husband in 2023, authorities said this week. Joseph Grieco, 38, was sentenced in Sussex County Superior Court by Judge Michael C. Gaus, the county Prosecutor's Office said in a press release Wednesday. He was found guilty of first-degree aggravated manslaughter in the death of John Kelly, 44, in January following a week-long trial. \"The sentencing by the court underscores the importance of safe and responsible gun ownership and the deadly consequences that can occur should a person disregard this responsibility,\" said acting prosecutor Sahil K. Kabse. According to the facts presented at the trial, Grieco and Kelly returned to their Vernon home early on the morning of July 26, 2023, following a night out with friends. Grieco had consumed alcohol at the Vernon VFW during the night and continued to drink while at home with Kelly and others. Grieco, a former Tenafly police officer, began to handle his handgun at some point in the night despite being repeatedly warned that the weapon was loaded, the press release stated. The firearm discharged, striking Kelly in the abdomen area. Kelly, a former New York City police officer, was transported to a hospital in Warwick, New York, where he died from his injuries, the prosecutor's office said. The prosecution argued for a 20-year prison sentence at trial, while the defense sought a five-year term. Grieco must serve 85% of his sentence before he is eligible for parole. The case was prosecuted by Kabse and assistant prosecutor Vanessa Henderson. Grieco was represented by S. Emile Lisboa IV.
