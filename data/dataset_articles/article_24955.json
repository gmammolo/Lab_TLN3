  "text": "Dechen Dolkar\nBhutan has a unique opportunity to contribute to the global energy transition due to its abundant hydroelectric potential, rich cultural heritage, focus on mindfulness, and unwavering commitment to sustainability.\nOn the final day of Bhutan Innovative Forum at Dungkar Dzong in Paro, renowned mining magnate Robert Friedland, founder of Ivanhoe Mines, highlighted Bhutan’s dual challenges and opportunities in the space of clean energy.\n“Bhutan has the potential to become a global leader in clean energy and sustainable development,” he said, while praising the country’s unique position in the region and the vision of its enlightened King.\nHe said that Bhutan is nominally now a carbon-negative country, but it has enormous challenges. “The hydroelectric potential is quite green in power compared to the alternatives.”\nWith a hydroelectric generation capacity of 2.5 gigawatts—equivalent to three and a half nuclear power plants—Bhutan produces green energy that surpasses many alternatives. However, during the dry winter months, the country must rely on electricity imports from India to meet its energy needs.\nRobert Friedland said that by scaling up its hydroelectric capacity, Bhutan can establish a domestic green economy, a knowledge-based economy, and a thriving financial hub.\nHe said a future where Bhutan becomes a global hub for sustainable development, attracting investment and talent from around the world.\nHe shared insights from his experiences in 64 countries, expressing admiration for the unique challenges and opportunities faced by Bhutan under the guidance of His Majesty the King.\nHe stressed the importance of retaining young talent to drive economic growth and improve the lives of its citizens. “We are talking about so much is about opportunities and retaining the youth of Bhutan and keeping them in the country and creating wealth for everybody,” he said.\nWhile acknowledging the significance of hydroelectric power, Robert Friedland also advocated for diversification of energy sources. “We need to explore other renewable energy options like solar and wind power,” he said. “But most importantly, we need to invest in technology and innovation to ensure a sustainable energy future.”\nHe also said that it is important to preserve Bhutan’s cultural heritage and natural environment. He urged the country to promote mindfulness and meditation as a way to foster a peaceful and harmonious society.\nAs the world shifts toward renewable energy to meet net-zero emissions targets, copper has emerged as a critical material due to its exceptional conductivity and versatility. It plays an essential role in developing renewable technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles, and is crucial for the transmission and distribution of electricity.\nRobert Friedland said that for Bhutan, where hydropower constitutes a significant part of the economy and energy infrastructure, the demand for copper in the development and maintenance of this clean energy source will only continue to grow.\nTo meet the global net-zero targets by 2050, the world will need an estimated three to four times more copper than is currently produced, he said. This unprecedented demand underscores the need for sustainable mining practices and innovative solutions to manage the supply of critical minerals.",
