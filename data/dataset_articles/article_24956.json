  "text": "Bhutan is known for pristine forests, clean rivers, and our carbon-negative status, and so, our carbon potential could unlock significant opportunities. Yet, challenges abound. The complexities of international carbon markets, governance limitations, and our unique development context all pose significant hurdles. To turn potential into profit, we must navigate these challenges strategically while maintaining its deep-rooted commitment to sustainability.\nOur most immediate obstacle perhaps is access to international carbon markets. International carbon markets are governed by intricate regulations, requiring countries to meet strict compliance standards. For us, with limited experience in carbon trading, navigating these regulations demands expertise and robust infrastructure. Establishing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems will be crucial. These systems can allow us to quantify its carbon emissions reductions or sequestrations and certify carbon credits for sale. However, MRV systems are both costly and complex, requiring not only financial investment but also skilled human resources.\nInstitutional capacity so is another challenge facing us . Effective governance frameworks and policies must be established to ensure transparency, accountability, and equity in carbon trading. We must build our capacity to manage carbon projects to ensure that government agencies, private sector players, and communities are all aligned. In the end, clear and efficient governance structures will be key to preventing inefficiencies, corruption, or unequal distribution of benefits from carbon trading.\nThe volatility of global carbon prices also poses a significant challenge. Carbon markets are subject to global economic conditions and shifts in international climate policies. For Bhutan, this unpredictability could mean unstable revenues from carbon credit sales. We must, therefore, diversify our carbon-related revenue streams, such as exploring nature-based solutions like afforestation, soil carbon sequestration, or even carbon capture technologies.\nOur geographic and demographic constraints limit the scale of carbon projects. With 70 percent of our land under forest cover, we have limited scope for further afforestation projects. Expanding carbon projects without undermining the country’s existing environmental protections will require innovation. That would mean focussing on sustainable land management practices, community-based reforestation projects, and harnessing indigenous knowledge for ecosystem preservation.\nOne of the most significant challenges perhaps is the high cost of verification and monitoring. Ensuring that carbon emissions reductions are legitimate requires robust MRV systems. Bhutan will need to invest heavily in advanced technologies like satellite monitoring, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain for transparent and efficient verification.\nWhile the challenges are many, solutions exist, and we must act swiftly to capitalise on our carbon potential. One practical solution is forging strategic partnerships. We can collaborate with international agencies, NGOs, and private companies with expertise in carbon trading, MRV systems, and climate financing for technical assistance, capacity-building, and financial support.\nAnother critical solution may lie in fostering community engagement. Carbon projects, particularly those related to forest conservation, must involve local communities to ensure long-term sustainability.\nWhat is critically necessary is developing a national carbon market strategy that includes clear guidelines on how carbon credits will be generated, verified, and sold. It should also outline how revenues will be invested back into the country.",
