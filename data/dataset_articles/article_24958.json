  "text": "Staff Reporter\nMountain Hazelnuts (MH) is proud to announce the launch of its domestic hazelnut sales at the Bhutan Innovation Forum, in partnership with CSI Market Bhutan. For an initial period, these premium hazelnuts will be available exclusively at CSI Market outlets.\nWhile MH remains committed to exporting high-quality hazelnuts to international markets, the company believes the domestic market should also have the opportunity to savour home-grown hazelnuts, cultivated without toxins or unethical labour practices.\nThe introduction of hazelnuts to the domestic market isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about promoting a sustainable approach to farming and living. Our vision is one that honours integrity, preserves Bhutanese culture, and fosters harmony between communities and the natural environment.\n“Around the world, hazelnuts will in the coming years, become one of Bhutan’s most recognized high quality and nutritious agricultural products. It is crucial that hazelnuts are also embraced by the nation and integrated into the food culture to truly represent Bhutan abroad. You are what you eat, and with increasing harvests and this launch, we hope more of the nation does consume our healthy and tasty hazelnuts,” states Dr. Sean Watson, CEO, Mountain Hazelnuts.\nNearly every aspect of the product is Bhutanese, from the nuts themselves to the packaging, reflecting a strong commitment to supporting local agriculture and cultural heritage. This initiative not only provides consumers with a healthy, ethically produced food choice but also strengthens the local economy.\n“Our partnership isn’t just about hazelnuts or market access. It’s a testament to the power of shared vision and collaborative effort. Together, Mountain Hazelnuts and CSI Market exemplify how impact-driven enterprises can pioneer a new economic model for Bhutan, one where prosperity is rooted in sustainability, collaboration, and shared success,” says Sonam Chophel, CEO, CSI Market.",
