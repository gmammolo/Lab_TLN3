  "text": "A project aimed at protecting endangered heritage buildings across Derbyshire is to be launched.\nThe Derbyshire \"Buildings at Risk\" initiative, which will use a new app in which volunteers can report the condition of Grade-II listed buildings, will be introduced to the public at an event in Belper on 24 October.\nDerbyshire Historic Buildings Trust (DHBT) has received a £207,000 grant from The National Lottery Heritage Fund for the project.\nAnna Cluley, from DHBT, said information gathered on the app, called B@R, would form an ongoing record, so the trust could address risks to buildings early on.\nA colour coding system will be used to categorise structures by their state of repair, said DHBT.\nThe scheme is being piloted in Amber Valley, before extending to Derby city and the wider county.\n'Take action' Ms Cluley, DHBT's heritage development officer and project coordinator, said: \"We are very excited that we have been able to fund the development of an app that allows volunteers to upload basic condition surveys of Grade-II listed buildings in Derbyshire.\n\"This then allows us to monitor the state of repair of these buildings and take action if they are at risk.\"\nShe added it was a great opportunity to get out and about and meet like-minded people, and no prior experience or specialist knowledge was needed.\nGlynn Wilton, from Amber Valley Council for Voluntary Services (CVS) - who is also chairman of the Derbyshire Museums and Heritage Forum - said: \"It's a wonderful opportunity to engage people with their heritage while helping to preserve it.\n\"Most people are unaware of the historical importance of the buildings around them.\"\nTwo public information sessions will take place on 24 October at the Strutts Community Centre, in Belper, one from 15:00 to 17:00 BST, and one from 18:30 to 20:30.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook , on X , or on Instagram .
