  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 4 (Bernama) – The International Greentech and Eco Products Exhibition and Conference Malaysia (IGEM) is expected to attract 48,000 participants and 480 exhibitors from 48 countries, generating business leads estimated at RM4.8 billion. Organised by the Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Ministry with co-organiser Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC), a statement from MGTC said the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) is its strategic partner for the Oct 9-11 2024 event. “The theme ‘Race Towards Net Zero: Regional Leadership for Climate Urgency’ reflects the pressing need for collective action against climate change,” the statement said. “As global efforts intensify to curb greenhouse gas emissions, IGEM will be at the forefront of critical discussions around sustainability and green technology solutions for the region’s future,” it said. MGTC group chief executive officer Shamsul Bahar Mohd Nor said IGEM’s role is to position Malaysia on the global stage as the country prepares for the ASEAN chairmanship in 2025 and the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan. “IGEM is a global nexus for innovation and collaboration where ideas evolve into tangible solutions. Bringing together international leaders, green businesses, and policymakers catalyses cross-border cooperation, knowledge exchange, and technological advancements that is crucial in addressing the climate crisis. “This platform amplifies Malaysia’s leadership on the world stage and creates the opportunity for meaningful partnerships that can drive impactful change globally,” Shamsul said. A key highlight of IGEM 2024 will be the Clean Energy Transition Asia (CETA) summit, which will unite ministers, policymakers, and private sector leaders to guide Asia's shift towards clean energy. The summit is designed to offer participants practical insights and strategies, focusing on public-private collaboration to boost clean energy efforts across the region. -- BERNAMA BERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.
