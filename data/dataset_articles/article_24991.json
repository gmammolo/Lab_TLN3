  "text": "Cloud computing has significantly changed how businesses handle their data and applications. Offering benefits such as cost savings, scalability, and flexibility, it has become an essential tool for enterprises aiming to stay competitive. However, beyond these operational advantages, cloud computing is increasingly playing a crucial role in sustainability, helping companies reduce their environmental impact. The Sustainability Impact of Cloud Computing Traditional data centers and on-premises servers consume substantial amounts of energy, resulting in high carbon emissions. Maintaining and cooling these servers requires significant power, often leading to wasted physical and digital resources. According to Naresh Purohit, Senior Director of Sales Engineering at Nutanix, “The demands on data centers are rapidly evolving, with artificial intelligence (AI) models becoming increasingly sophisticated and power-hungry. As organisations in India strive to maintain a competitive edge in the global AI race, they must ensure their data centers are flexible and scalable, configured appropriately to meet current and future demands, as well as sustainability targets.” In response to these concerns, major cloud providers are investing in renewable energy and enhancing their infrastructure for greater efficiency. For example, companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are actively working towards powering their data centers with renewable energy, significantly reducing their carbon footprints. The scalability of cloud computing allows organisations to use only the necessary computing power, reducing excess hardware and energy consumption. Shifting to cloud-based solutions not only minimises dependence on physical infrastructure but also decreases electronic waste (e-waste) and overall energy usage. The shared infrastructure model inherent in cloud computing means that fewer resources are needed per organisation, resulting in lower energy consumption, reduced operational costs, and a smaller environmental footprint. Ranganath Sadasiva, Chief Technology Officer at HPE India, said, “The technology industry embraces renewable energy, carbon-neutral strategies, and advanced technologies like AI to monitor and reduce resource consumption. These initiatives aim to cut emissions and foster long-term change, ensuring cloud computing becomes a catalyst for a sustainable future.” What Is Green Cloud Computing? Green cloud computing focuses on using cloud services in a way that minimises environmental impact. This involves utilising energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy sources, and strategies that aim to reduce waste. As businesses grow, the demand for data centers increases, raising concerns about sustainability. Green cloud computing helps address these concerns by offering solutions that lower the carbon footprint of data centers. By adopting green cloud computing, organisations can optimise their operations while meeting their environmental sustainability goals. This involves using energy-efficient servers, advanced cooling systems, and sustainable IT resources to reduce energy consumption and operational costs. Devroop Dhar, Co-founder and Managing Director at Primus Partners, said, “Data centers contribute significantly to energy consumption and carbon emissions. As organisations shift towards cloud computing, the need to balance cloud requirements with sustainability is gaining traction. With India set to double its data center capacity, the need to reduce carbon emissions is urgent, making sustainable cloud computing increasingly important.” Reducing E-Waste Managing e-waste is a critical challenge for the tech industry as technology advances. Cloud providers are tackling this by implementing e-waste management programs that focus on recycling and responsibly disposing of outdated hardware. By extending the lifecycle of equipment and ensuring responsible disposal, cloud providers contribute to reducing the negative impact of e-waste on the environment. Additionally, the strategic location of data centers plays a role in reducing energy use. Cloud providers are establishing data centers in regions with abundant renewable energy sources and optimising their designs for energy efficiency. Sandeep Bhargava, Senior Vice President of Global Services and Solutions at Rackspace Technology, said, “Data contributes to cloud waste, often due to underutilised network equipment or servers. Companies are also facing the issue of unnecessary data backups and the costs of cooling powered-on servers that are not in use. This is why companies are shifting to more sustainable, greener cloud computing options.” Aneesh Jain, Chief Technology Officer at Thrivepass, said, “By taking advantage of shared resources, we can ensure the proper utilisation of servers to minimise idle capacity and subsequently reduce carbon emissions. Energy-efficient data centers, built by cloud providers using sophisticated cooling systems and renewable energy, can save considerable amounts of energy.” The Role of Edge Computing Edge computing is another development influencing the sustainability of cloud services. It brings computational power closer to end users, reducing the need for data to travel long distances. This reduces both energy consumption and latency, making operations more efficient. By processing data at the edge, businesses can lessen their dependence on central data centers, which further decreases energy requirements. While still in its early stages, edge computing is expected to become a mainstream solution that can contribute in reducing cloud-related energy consumption. The Bottom Line Sustainable cloud computing offers a pathway for businesses to manage their digital transformation while also meeting environmental sustainability targets. By reducing energy consumption, limiting e-waste, and incorporating renewable energy sources, green cloud computing aligns business efficiency with environmental responsibility. As sustainability becomes a core business priority, adopting green cloud solutions is evolving from a choice to a necessity. By embracing these technologies, companies can significantly lower their environmental impact while benefiting from cost savings and operational efficiency.",
