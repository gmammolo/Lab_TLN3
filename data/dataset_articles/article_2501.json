  "text": "Neighbors concerned about trash overflowing from home in Roanoke\nROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Neighbors in Roanoke City are sounding the alarm about a house in their neighborhood that is overflowing with trash, which they say is an eyesore and a health hazard. Neighbors said they’ve been asking the city to take action for two years and reached out to WDBJ7 about the home in the 500 block of McDowell Avenue.\n“The city has said they’re taking them to court. I’m not being funny, but when the grass is overgrown, and they put a notice out, they come and cut the grass. So why couldn’t something be done with this? We’ve called the city’s code enforcement office, we’ve seen people come out, but nothing has ever been done,” said Tei Mann, who lives next door to the property.\nThe property on McDowell Avenue has trash and various items scattered all around the outside of the home. Mann said it’s not only an eyesore; it creates a bad smell and causes some health concerns for people living in the area.\n“It’s just getting worse. It’s on the sidewalks. It’s in the backyard. We’re having rats running through the yard. The neighbor can’t let her dogs out just due to the rats being out in the morning. I have a trampoline, and I can’t even put my children back there just for the fear of the rats,” she said.\nMann said the trash buildup on the property began in April 2023 and has only gotten worse since then, despite neighbors complaining to the homeowner and making calls to the city. She said when it rains, the problem becomes even worse.\n“It smells like mildew. It smells like a giant sock, like you’re sitting inside of a giant dirty gym sock. It’s just getting awful, and you can’t really walk down the sidewalk,” said Mann. “My children can’t ride their bicycles just because they’re going to run over stuff. I walked down through there, and there was kerosene, gas, spilled everywhere, and you wouldn’t even have known it was there if you hadn’t looked down.”\nMann said people driving by will sometimes stop to take pictures of the house.\n“It’s affecting everybody. I feel like it’s bringing the property values down. We just had a new house built across the street, and everybody else’s yards are kept neat. It’s becoming like a tourist attraction for Roanoke City. The city bus will stop and take pictures,” she said.\nMann said the property also attracts unwanted animals.\n“It’s not only just rats, it’s raccoons, it’s possums. We don’t know what else is left, and it’s a safety hazard because you never know what may blow over, if it’s a nail or anything. If it catches fire, my house is gone,” she said.\nThe City of Roanoke has taken legal action against the property owner for failing to comply with the city zoning code, and he has been fined four times over the last year, most recently last week when a judge fined him $1,000.\n“We’ve had the property owner in court as far back as May 2024. At that time, the property owner was found guilty and fined $500 due to non-compliance, a series of really not taking heed to the city’s requests to remove the items,” said Roanoke City Codes Compliance Administrator Jeff White.\nWhite said because the property has continued to violate the city code, the city has continued to pursue legal action against the property owner. The court case against the owner is ongoing and was presented to a grand jury on Monday. It is awaiting indictment.\n“We are staying ready. We are prepared to continue pursuing legal action and do what we are allowed to bring this issue into legal compliance. That may come in the form of the indictment and what unfolds from that decision, and our office working with that assistant commonwealth’s attorney’s office to ensure that we can resolve this issue,” said White.\nWhite said the city’s goal is to get the items removed from the property either by the property owner or by the city itself, depending on the court’s ruling.\n“We want to see those items removed from the property, or because it is outdoor storage, they could keep it, of course, but it would have to be in a fully enclosed building,” said White. “It is possible that at some point nearing the end of this legal pursuit or some time depending on the decision, that yeah, we may be in a position to go in there and actually remove it. But of course, at this point, it is in the court’s hands.”\nWhite thanked the people living in the neighborhood for their patience.\n“They have been extremely patient, and we definitely appreciate that. Anytime you’re dealing with an owner who is non-compliant and is simply not responding to city notices, there is a process, in this case, a legal process, which has to play out fully before we can see a complete resolution to this particular matter,” he said.\nWhite said he encourages concerned neighbors to reach out to the city about the property, and it will gladly communicate where things stand with the legal case.\nCopyright 2025 WDBJ.
