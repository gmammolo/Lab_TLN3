  "text": "MOUNT VERNON, Ind. (WEHT) – Indiana’s Severe Weather Preparedness Week is taking on a different tone this year in Mount Vernon, coming on the heels of last year’s July 9th tornado. Posey County Emergency Management Director Carrie Thompson says those lessons are being applied to this week’s threat for severe weather. “Never assume that it’s not going to happen to you,” says Thompson. She says that is one of the major lessons learned from last year’s tornado. Thompson is also taking that lesson to heart. “I’ve worked for emergency management for over 12 years now,” explains Thompson, “and for the first 11 years that I was in my position, we were very lucky. We had severe storms, there was some tornadoes, but they didn’t really do any major damage, and then we kind of got the double whammy last year with a total of 7.” This year, severe weather risks look to wrap up the preparedness week and Thompson says this is the perfect opportunity to make a plan and make sure you have multiple ways to be alerted of severe weather. “Plenty of time in advance, you want to know where your safe place is,” says Thompson. “Make sure you have blankets, maybe extra water, snacks. Make sure your devices are charged. That’s more of a day-of type of thing. Just make sure everything’s ready to go and in your safe place.” In response to the July 9th tornado, Thompson is already making calls with severe weather looming, just in case. “We had people that needed somewhere to go. And, while we had possible shelter locations in mind,” says Thompson, “We’re starting to make those contacts now where, if this happens, can we send people to you?” Mount Vernon Mayor Steve Loehr says the city and he, personally, have taken severe weather more seriously since last year’s tornado. His statement to Eyewitness News can be read below. “After last year’s tornado we now realize that we are just as vulnerable as any other community. I also believe that people will take warnings a little more seriously now, including myself.” – Mount Vernon Mayor Steve Loehr One weather notification option Thompson recommends for Posey County residents is “Code Red”.
