  "text": "Huntsville Green Team encouraging people to enjoy the outdoors\nHUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - Wednesday was a beautiful day across the Tennessee Valley, and the Huntsville Green Team is encouraging people to get out and enjoy it.\nBikers, hikers, and explorers from across the valley took to the Hayes Nature Preserve for a special outdoor event.\nThe Green team gathered up local businesses and brought them out for a free outdoor event to encourage the community to come out and enjoy our local nature.\nA Scavenger hunt was even held to keep the little ones active outside.\nOrganizers said while it was a fun event, it can also help keep you healthy.\n“We always want to encourage people to be outdoors,” said Nikole Sothers, the Huntsville Green Team Manager. “We think that having a connection to the environment also has a connection to keeping our city clean.”\nSothers went on to say it can also help improve mental and physical health as people get out and be social while enjoying their hobbies.\nClick Here to Subscribe on YouTube: Watch the latest WAFF 48 news, sports & weather videos on our YouTube channel!\nCopyright 2025 WAFF.
