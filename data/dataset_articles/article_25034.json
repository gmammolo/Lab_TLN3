With the approaching winter season, the company warns that increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are expected to bring heavier rainfall, and adequate stormwater drainage is essential to protecting homes from flooding and water damage.\n\"Homeowners need to be proactive in addressing their stormwater drainage systems, particularly as we head into the storm season,\" said a representative for Fix-It Right Plumbing. \"As we've seen with Cyclone Alfred and the upcoming winter rains, the risk of severe weather events is real, and inadequate stormwater drainage systems can lead to costly damage to properties.\"\nFix-It Right Plumbing is dedicated to raising awareness among homeowners about the crucial role that properly maintained stormwater drains play in preventing flooding and water damage during extreme weather events.

Regular inspections and drain clearing are necessary to avoid blockages that could lead to backups and flooding.
