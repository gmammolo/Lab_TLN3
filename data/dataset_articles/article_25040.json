  "text": "A ceremonial groundbreaking at Southwest Florida International Airport offered a bird's eye view of a $1.1 billion dollar expansion that will add a new concourse. On Wednesday, local media – and dozens of other invitees and VIPs – gathered under a tent, near the busy construction site, in south Fort Myers, for the event. A parade of noisy trucks dumped loads of dirt in the background, while massive drills bored into the ground, in preparation for foundational work. Meanwhile, planes flew by, uninterrupted. The construction site for the new Concourse E isn't something passengers see or feel (although they are experiencing some turbulence inside and outside of the existing terminal, to make way for it). The raw land, sitting west of Concourse D, is still filled with dirt piles, but it's evolving daily. The expansion will require 375,000 cubic yards of dirt, coming from local vendors. With the beeping of construction trucks and buzzing of airplanes as a backdrop, speakers at the groundbreaking ceremony emphasized the need for and importance of the massive project to support the airport's expected growth. Work on the new three-level concourse, which will add another 513,000 square feet to the main terminal, actually kicked off in October. Initially, the new concourse will add 14 gates, increasing the total number by 50%. \"The opening of Southwest Florida International Airport on May 14, 1983, was a historic moment for our region, with far reaching social and economic impacts, and those continue today, with record breaking passenger numbers during the past several decades,\" said Steven Hennigan, the executive director and CEO of the Lee County Port Authority, which operates the airport. The airport must keep pace with that growth, and the new concourse will meet that need, benefiting travelers for \"years to come,\" he said. The project is being funded by Florida Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration grants, general airport revenue bonds, and passenger facility charges. Boarding passengers pay $4.50, per flight, as part of their ticket price, which is used for airport improvements to support growth. No property taxes are used for airport construction, maintenance, land acquisition, or operations. During the event, speaker Nicole Mills, director of transportation development at the Florida Department of Transportation, expressed how she's honored to be involved in the project, having built a strong relationship with the airport and its employees over many years. The department is providing more than $110 million in funding over the next few years to support the expansion. Describing the expansion project in a word as \"wonderful,\" Mills said it would help the community, the residents and the tourists alike. \"With the growth in the airport, it truly does need this, this concourse,\" she said. Looking ahead, Mills expressed her hope of seeing another runway built. \"You know, we're gonna go for that runway,\" she said. \"I've been after that second runway for years.\" She boasted about the ease of getting in and out of Southwest Florida International, known for short as RSW. She shared how she uses it to travel herself, even though she lives in Bartow, hours away. She stressed how the airport supports more than 60,000 jobs (not including those involved in current construction). \"So, 60,000 jobs is amazing, and we're bringing $8.3 billion of money into our economy here. So, that's great,\" Mills said. The project itself will create 1,000 construction jobs (at its peak). In a spirited speech, Cecil Pendergrass, vice chairman of the Lee County Commission, encouraged attendees to take in the sights and sounds. \"Look around,\" he said. \"This is construction at its best, right?\" He highlighted the benefits of having a \"world-class airport in our backyard,\" from moving people and products to creating services and generating revenue for businesses. It's no secret the airport brings in a lot of visitors, which is sometimes all too obvious on Daniels Parkway, nearby, when they \"don't turn right on red,\" or they have trouble navigating a roundabout, Pendergrass said, with a laugh. He pointed out those visitors are needed to support local businesses, including countless hotels, restaurants and shops. He noted the airport is what connects the region to the rest of the world and provides it with access to an increasingly global marketplace. \"The long-term forecast for RSW is very strong, and Concourse E will help us meet the future needs of commercial aviation in our region,\" while marking another chapter in the airport's history in Southwest Florida, Pendergrass said. Following the speeches, Pendergrass and a line of others posed for pictures with bright blue helmets and shovels, behind a ceremonial pile of dirt, and scooped the dirt into the crisp air. The expansion will be Lee County's largest public works project ― ever.

The project will include: The project will also include extensive airside and landside improvements, and new concessions. Notable design features, inside and out, include glass exterior walls and terrazzo flooring. Here's a by the numbers look at what's involved in the historical expansion: Construction is expected to take about three years, with a targeted completion by December 2027. The additional gates in Concourse E will allow 10,000 to 15,000 more passengers to come into the airport and into the region every day. Vertical construction will probably be noticeable by fall. Last year, the airport handled more than 11 million passengers, setting a new record. It's one of the top 50 U.S. airports for passenger traffic. It's served by 15 airlines. United, American and Frontier will be relocating to the new concourse. There will be enough room to support a total of 33 gates in the future. Earlier: New concourse approved at Southwest Florida International, with billion-dollar price tag While the first phase of the terminal expansion has faced mounting costs and delays, it has not impacted the second phase of adding a new concourse. The first phase involves expanding and improving the terminal by consolidating and streamlining security checkpoints and adding space for more shops and restaurants, seating and a business lounge. If approved, contract revisions would more than double the price of that project and extend construction by more than three years. A revised estimate has put the cost at almost $678.4 million. That's about $347 million more than budgeted.

The first phase ground to a virtual halt more than a year ago after Manhattan Construction, the general contractor, discovered errors in the structural design. Based on the new design, Manhattan has estimated another 43 months will be needed to complete construction, including repairs and reinforcements to what has already been built. The project was supposed to be completed last year. This article originally appeared on Fort Myers News-Press: Groundbreaking event shows need for new concourse at Southwest Florida International",
