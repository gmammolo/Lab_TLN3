  "text": "Windowless cold arenas are a thing of the past at the newly opened Rosemary Brown Recreation Centre in Burnaby, B.C. Inside the 91,999-square-foot community hub, natural light, exposed mass timber and a transparent, open layout bring warmth to the human-centred design.\nTo create a more dynamic public experience, hcma architecture + design imagined an inclusive facility that isn’t solely dedicated to sport. An abundance of north-facing light fills the rinks without impacting the quality of ice. The clerestories were possible through the flexibility of a hybrid steel-timber roof system, which allowed for a complex geometry.\nWood greatly contributes to the centre’s character. Glulams serve as both beams and vertical columns that support the structure in the lobby and contribute to its warm, inviting ambience visible from both inside and outside, hcma described.\nNail-laminated timber, a century-old construction method, was used for the lobby’s decking system to offer superior acoustic integration, while enhancing the overall experience.\nThe site’s tight footprint led to a non-traditional arrangement of its two NHL-sized ice sheets: an L-shape with a central lobby located at their meeting point. This brings an openness between the lobby and the ice sheets, as well as a friendly, animated elevation to the street and community beyond. Both rinks have a total 411-seat capacity.\nInside, the Burnaby community will also discover multipurpose rooms and spaces within the lobby for activities beyond ice sports, such as pickleball, pilates and playoff watch parties. There is a skate shop, concession and outdoor rooftop patio.\nWarm-side galleries on the second floor offer accessible viewing, while informal play areas directly behind allow children to engage in casual, self-directed play.\nThe centre also embodies the legacy of Rosemary Brown —a trailblazing Canadian advocate for social justice and equality. Inclusivity is featured prominently through fully accessible washrooms and change rooms with gender-neutral options.\nAs well, the design considers how washroom accessories, such as hand dryers, impact neurodiversity.\nBraille and tactile signage, created by hcma’s communication design team, support visual impairment. There are also wide circulation paths and high contrast wayfinding, elevator access to level two programming, and provisions for sledge hockey, benches and accessible furnishings throughout the facility.\n“Rosemary Brown Recreation Centre is more than an arena; it’s a space designed to foster community through recreation and high-performance sport,” said Paul Fast, principal at hcma architecture + design. “The Centre’s ambition is to become an essential fixture in Burnaby’s Southgate community, supporting the next generation of athletes, weekend warriors, and recreation enthusiasts alike.”\nFeature photo by Ema Peter.",
