  "text": "Burdette Park closed starting Friday due to flooding\nVANDERBURGH CO., Ind. (WFIE) - Vanderburgh County Commissioners say Burdette Park and the surrounding areas are experiencing severe flooding.\nThey say the river is expected to crest at around 48 feet, which is the highest it’s been since 1945.\nRight now, the main entrance and exit at Burdette Park is now closed because of high water.\nOfficials say Nurrenbern Road is expected to become impassable by the end of Wednesday.\nThey say for the time being, employees and guests should use the west entrance at the back of the park.\nHowever, starting Friday, Burdette Park will be closed to the public until further notice, including all scheduled events.\n“Our top priority is the safety and well-being of our guests and staff,” said Park Director, Zach Wathen. “We will continue to work closely with the Vanderburgh County Commissioners and keep the public informed as the situation develops.”\nCopyright 2025 WFIE.
