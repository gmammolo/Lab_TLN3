  "text": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (WISH) — The Monroe County water treatment plant was approved for upgrades. March 10, the Utilities Service Board approved the upgrades as part of Mayor Kerry Thomson’s 2024 Transition Report. Wessler Engineering worked with the City of Bloomington to design the upgrades scope, schedule, and costs. The plant will get an upgraded treatment feed system for disinfection chemicals and fluoride , will add a backwash pump for reliability, and will replace the lighting with LEDs to be more energy efficient. “A city’s infrastructure is only as strong as its commitment to maintaining and improving it. The upgrades to the Monroe Water Treatment Plant are not only about repairs—they are about future-proofing Bloomington’s water system,” Thomson said. “Water is the foundation of public health, and ensuring its safety and reliability is one of our most important responsibilities as a city.” $5 million was awarded for the upgrades, which is expected to be complete by fall of 2026.",
