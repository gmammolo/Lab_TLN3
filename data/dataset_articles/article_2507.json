  "text": "The driver of a noisy Camaro dialed 911 after he was pulled over by a police officer.\nJavon Antwon Baker, 22, who lives at The Cove apartments in Lady Lake, was driving a silver Chevy Camaro at 9:30 a.m. Sunday on U.S. Hwy. 27 at Banana Street when he was “pushing the accelerator making the exhaust emit noise louder than 25 feet away,” according to an arrest report from the Lady Lake Police Department.\nDuring a traffic stop, Baker became “belligerent.” He demanded that a sergeant be summoned to the scene of the traffic stop. Baker said he “wasn’t going to jail” and dialed 911. He was warned he would be making a non-emergency call to 911, which is against the law. Baker made the call despite the warning.\nBaker was ordered to get out of his car, but despite numerous requests, he would not budge from the Camaro.\nHe was removed from the vehicle and arrested on charges of misuse of 91 and resisting arrest. He was booked at the Lake County Jail and released after posting $2,000 bond.\nBaker was arrested in 2023 after allegedly swiping money from the Jackpot Casino in Tavares.",
