  "text": "The new promenade at Praia Formosa beach is gaining popularity among both locals and tourists. Take a look at the video of the promenade and catch a glimpse of the proposed design for the new public garden. Funchal City Council intends to revitalise the entire Praia Formosa area by the end of 2025.\nIt is one of the major private investments for the upcoming years in the city of Funchal, bringing together entrepreneurs Cristiano Ronaldo and Dionísio Pestana in what will be a transformative project aimed at revitalising the entire Praia Formosa area, to the west of the Madeiran capital.\nA significant portion of the project will take place on private land that the new project developers have acquired. Private entities, on the other hand, will need to invest eight million euros to carry out the works related to the public area. In other words, as a counterpart, the entrepreneurs will be required to create public spaces and public parking areas, an intervention that will also allow for the creation of what will be the largest public garden on the island of Madeira, surpassing the size of Santa Catarina Park. A sea wall will also be constructed, housing a sprawling free sunbathing area for beachgoers.\nThe project envisions the construction of six buildings, each with nine floors, and approximately 550 apartments that are already being sold. The construction of buildings and public areas such as parking lots, residential buildings, and a large public garden is expected to begin in the summer of 2024.\nView our webcams for live views of Funchal and the rest of Madeira Island.",
