Which isn’t really normal for ducks,” said Kenna Chamlee with Wildlife Rehabilitation. “A lot of them we could see were very wet, which isn’t really normal for ducks.”\nNormally, water runs right off their feathers, but the diesel was messing with the birds’ natural oils.\nSo, members of a local wildlife group got their hands dirty to help.\n“We proceeded to basically leap into the water to try to get them,” Chamlee said.\nAnd they were able to get eight, but there are still more at the pond that need to be washed.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality said 5 gallons of diesel made its way into a storm drain after a malfunction at the OU power plant.\nIt’s something OU self-reported. The university put out skimmers to soak up the fuel, and some locals are hoping OU will help the effort monetarily.\nWildcare Oklahoma relies on donations and said right now, it is working on washing the birds off, but bird flu is getting in the way.\nGet the latest news stories of interest by clicking here.\n“With all this washing, we don’t have the proper facilities out there to do that at the moment, but they need to come over to this building as soon as possible. To do that, we need to make sure that they’re negative,” said Paul Rusinko, wildlife rehabilitation manager.\nIn the meantime, they’re figuring out the best way to wash them all off with the right ratio of water to Dawn dish soap.\n“I’m just going to take a feather and try it in each dilution and see which one is going to be best for us to get it off,” said Mattie Yates, a veterinarian. “It should not stay wet like this; it should have been a waterproof feather.”\nOU gave KOCO 5 a statement saying they appreciate the support of Wildcare and say they're working to confirm the original source:\n“We are monitoring the situation and working to confirm the original source. On March 6, we were alerted to what appeared to be diesel fuel in the duck pond. When the presence of diesel was confirmed, SET Environmental was contacted and immediately began the containment and cleanup process, using booms to prevent the diesel from leaving the site and traveling downstream. Once contained, they removed the fuel from the surface of the water. The Oklahoma State Department of Environmental Quality and City of Norman were advised the remediation process was underway. We also appreciate the support of WildCare Oklahoma and their commitment to wildlife conservation and rehabilitation in the state.”\nTop Headlines\nTIMELINE: Severe storms bring hail and tornado risk to parts of Oklahoma on Wednesday‘We are devastated’: Edmond North High Schools mourns death of senior Maddie HayesNASA’s newest space telescope blasts off to map the entire sky and millions of galaxiesWATCH: Get to know Jordan Ryan, the newest member of the KOCO 5 news team",
