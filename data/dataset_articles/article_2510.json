  "text": "COOK COUNTY - In a move stirring debate over public safety and judicial oversight, Cook County State's Attorney Eileen O'Neill Burke has directed her prosecutors to contest the assignment of electronic monitoring in cases where they deem detention more appropriate. This directive reflects escalating apprehensions regarding the administration and effectiveness of the county's electronic monitoring system.​ Historically managed by Sheriff Tom Dart since its inception in 1989, the electronic monitoring program was initially designed to alleviate jail overcrowding by supervising low-level, non-violent offenders awaiting trial. However, the program's scope expanded over time to include individuals charged with serious offenses, including murder. Citing safety concerns and legislative changes that granted monitored individuals two days of unrestricted movement per week, Sheriff Dart announced plans in December 2024 to phase out his department's involvement in the program. He expressed doubts about the program's current efficacy and safety, stating, \"We can’t look people in the eye and say ‘this is an effective, responsible program right now.’\" ​ The responsibility for electronic monitoring subsequently shifted to the Office of the Chief Judge, Timothy Evans. This transition has raised concerns about adequate staffing and resources. Judge Evans acknowledged the need for approximately 150 additional hires and an estimated $23.9 million annually to effectively manage the expanded program. Unlike sheriff's deputies, probation officers under the Chief Judge's purview lack arrest powers, necessitating reliance on local law enforcement to apprehend individuals who violate monitoring terms. State's Attorney O'Neill Burke has voiced skepticism about the Chief Judge's capacity to safely administer the electronic monitoring system. In a memo to her staff, she highlighted that personnel from the Office of the Chief Judge are not law enforcement officers and therefore cannot independently investigate or arrest individuals who abscond from monitoring. She emphasized, \"This is a serious threat to public safety and we must make that clear on the record.\" ​ In response to these concerns, O'Neill Burke has mandated that prosecutors object on the record whenever a judge opts for electronic monitoring over detention in cases where the prosecution has sought the latter. This policy aims to underscore the perceived risks associated with the current administration of the monitoring program.​ Advocacy groups have expressed support for consolidating the electronic monitoring program under the judiciary, arguing that it could reduce the harms associated with the previous system managed by the Sheriff's Office. Chicago Appleseed Center for Fair Courts noted that the Sheriff's program had been \"incredibly harmful to people being monitored and their families,\" citing unnecessary restrictions and technical issues.",
