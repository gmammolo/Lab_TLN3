  "text": "Chinese agricultural scientists are developing new strains of protein-rich corn that can serve as a substitute for soybeans in animal feed, a potential game-changer for China’s drive to reduce its reliance on overseas grain.\\nChina has been forced to import soybeans in huge quantities in recent years to fuel its expanding livestock industry, as Chinese consumers adopt an increasingly meat and dairy-heavy diet.\\nBeijing sees the growing dependence on foreign agricultural products as a threat to the nation’s food security, as well as a potential issue of contention amid an intensifying trade war with the United States.\\nDeveloping higher-protein corn to replace soybeans in animal feed is seen as a potential solution, and researchers at China’s Huazhong Agricultural University have already developed several promising varieties, according to the university’s president.\\nGiven China’s vast corn production, an improvement of just one percentage point in the protein content of the grain could reduce China’s demand for foreign soybeans by up to 8 million tonnes, Yan Jianbing, Huazhong’s president, told reporters during last week’s “two sessions” – the annual meeting of China’s top legislative and consultative bodies.\\nChina has been placing increasing emphasis on food security amid a rise in geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in the international market.\\nChina’s soybean imports account for about 60 per cent of the world’s total trade volume for the grain, and the US has long been one of the country’s largest suppliers alongside Brazil.\\nThis dependence on American soybeans has been a double-edged sword for Beijing. In the past, it has weaponised the trade by threatening to reduce purchases of US grain, hurting the incomes of farmers in the Midwest.\\nJust this month, China slapped tariffs on US agricultural products – including soybeans – in retaliation for Washington’s hike in duties on Chinese goods.\\nBut its reliance on US grain is also a potential strategic weakness, and China has been steadily moving to diversify its soybean supply in recent years. The US now accounts for more than one-fifth of Chinese imports, down from nearly 40 per cent a decade ago.\\n\\n\\n<img src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Tiltz/full.png\" alt=\"\" />\\n\\n“Last year, China’s total corn production reached 290 million tonnes. If the protein content of corn increases by one percentage point, it could add 2.9 million tonnes of protein annually,” Yan said.\\nYan’s team has developed multiple high-protein corn varieties that have achieved an average protein content of 10 per cent, which is two percentage points higher than that of regular corn, he said.\\nMore than 10 million mu (667,000 hectares) of the new corn has already been planted, Yan added.\\nTraditionally, corn has served as the primary energy source in animal feed, while soybean meal has been the main source of protein.\\nChina’s soybean imports reached 105 million tonnes last year, with the majority being used as protein feed for livestock and poultry, according to Chinese customs data.\\nTo replace these imports with domestically grown soybeans, China would need to add 70 to 80 million mu of farmland, an impractical proposition in a nation of 1.4 billion people where land is a precious resource, Yan said.\\nChina has prioritised maintaining self-sufficiency in staple grains like rice and wheat, where it boasts world-leading production technology. But the per unit yields of its corn and soybeans are only 60 per cent of those in the US, according to figures frequently cited by Chinese officials.\\nDespite this, China’s minister of agriculture, Han Jun, stated during the two sessions that China “has entered the top tier of global agricultural innovation”, with agricultural technology contributing over 63 per cent of China’s overall productivity growth last year.\\n“The fundamental solution to the issue of food is technology,” he said in a group interview over the weekend.\\nIn his government work report last week, Premier Li Qiang set a target for China to produce 700 million tonnes of grain this year and to continue focusing on improving yields and quality.\\nChina managed to reach this milestone last year, reporting a record high grain output of 706.5 million tonnes.\\n",
