  "text": "KRONENWETTER, Wis. (WAOW) - The Village of Kronenwetter held a ribbon cutting for their new water filtration system.\nThe event was open to anyone who wanted to attend. City officials showed everyone how it works. Along with having a taste test between raw water, and what it tastes like after the filter.\nPublic Works Director Greg Ulman said, \"We are expecting quite a few people from the community to come, village board members, utility committees. Bunch of residents to come and really share the excitement with us.\"\nAfter the ribbon was snipped, residents asked all kinds of questions to really understand how it works.\nThe system has been running for the Village since January 22nd. However this is the first time people were able to see it.",
