  "text": "Total lunar eclipse this Friday\nAstroBob explains our upcoming celestial treat with a lunar eclipse happening Friday.\nGet ready for a celestial treat early Friday morning. The Sun, Earth, and Moon will align to form a total lunar eclipse.\nBob King, of AstroBob’s Astronomy for Everyone, tells us to look at the sky between midnight and 4:00 a.m. Spectators will be able to see a red color reflected on the moon.\nAstroBob recommends heading south to avoid the forecasted cloudy weather in the Northland, but if you can’t, you can watch a live stream of the Moon’s perspective, which shows the Earth blocking the Sun.",
