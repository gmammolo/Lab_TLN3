  "text": "WELLFLEET, Mass. (WPRI) — Researchers spotted an encouraging sign for a critically endangered species in Cape Cod Bay on Tuesday. The Center for Coastal Studies (CCS) said its aerial observers saw a North Atlantic right whale calf with its mother about five miles west of Great Island in Wellfleet. This calf is the first baby right whale spotted in Massachusetts waters for the 2025 season. The calf’s mother was identified as a 31-year-old whale named Nauset. Clearwater Marine Aquarium Research Institute first spotted Nauset with her newborn calf on Dec. 1 off the coast of Georgia during an aerial survey. North Atlantic right whales normally calve further south before migrating north to feeding grounds in New England and Canadian waters. According to the CCS, Cape Cod Bay is home to one of the largest feeding aggregations of right whales in the world. During right whale season, Massachusetts requires vessels to travel under 10 knots in certain areas. It is also illegal for boaters, kayakers, drone pilots and swimmers to approach a North Atlantic right within 500 yards without a federal research permit. This season, researchers have seen 80 individual right whales in the bay so far. There are only an estimated 372 individuals left. “The first sighting of mother/calf pairs in Cape Cod Bay each season is always an exciting moment that brings hope for the species,” CCS Whale Ecology Program Director Dr. Daniel Palacios said in a press release. “Every birth is vital for population recovery. The long-term survival of the species depends on these calves.” Download the WPRI 12 and Pinpoint Weather 12 apps to get breaking news and weather alerts.
