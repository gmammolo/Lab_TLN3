  "text": "Amazon, Google, and Meta signed a commitment this week supporting at least a threefold increase in global nuclear energy by 2050.\nIn today’s world, where climate change and the environmental crisis occupy a priority spot on the global agenda, companies’ commitment to sustainability has become a crucial factor for their market relevance and long-term presence. Today, more than just a corporate social responsibility strategy, sustainability stands as an indispensable pillar in the planning and operation of organizations.\nAccording to the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals 2024” report, 90 percent of companies in member countries have adopted at least one sustainability policy. However, only 35 percent have managed to implement measures with tangible results in carbon emission reduction, energy efficiency, or natural resource conservation.\nCommitment to Tripling Nuclear Energy by 2050 The Large Energy User Commitment, backed by the World Nuclear Association and industrial giants such as Dow, Occidental, Allseas, and OSGE, is non-binding. However, it demonstrates broad support for the expansion of nuclear energy after years of opposition from environmental groups.\nThis shows how tech giants continue to be some of the main drivers of energy in the United States as they expand high-energy-consuming data centers to support AI development.\nAccording to the commitment, companies recognize that “nuclear energy can provide power 24 hours a day, regardless of weather, season, or geographic location.”\nThe companies are currently attending the annual CERAWeek conference, organized by S&P Global in Houston. More than 10,000 participants from 80 countries gather to attend panels and discuss future challenges for energy security, supply, and climate ambitions, according to the CERAWeek website.\nReports indicate that tech giants moved toward nuclear energy in October, focusing on small modular reactors that can be used to generate power and heat.\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden considered nuclear energy a key aspect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and signed a law, approved by a bipartisan majority in Congress in February 2024, aimed at accelerating the development of nuclear power plants.\nDuring the 2023 Global Climate Action Summit, the United States and 20 other countries signed the initial commitment to triple nuclear energy, but this commitment now includes non-governmental actors.\nThe commitment’s final point includes “a call to other major energy-using companies to join this commitment.”\nReed more: Reebok launches a golf footwear and apparel collection; how much will it cost and when will it go on sale?\nNetflix announces a Cujo movie, the classic Stephen King thriller; when will it arrive?\nFortnite regresa a iPhone en Latam tras ganar batalla contra Apple",
