  "text": "KUCHING (March 12): Sarawak’s investments in hydrogen energy are strategic moves leveraging the state’s unique resources, not reckless gambles doomed to fail, said Batu Kitang assemblyman Dato Lo Khere Chiang.Responding to DAP’s Pending assemblywoman Violet Yong’s recent criticism of the state’s hydrogen initiatives, Lo dismissed her arguments as “narrow and outdated”, saying they fail to acknowledge Sarawak’s competitive edge in the global clean energy transition.“Sarawak is not blindly investing in hydrogen; we are strategically leveraging our strengths.",
