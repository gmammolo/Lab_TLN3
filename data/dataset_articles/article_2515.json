  "text": "PENNSYLVANIA — A recent drug arrest in Altoona has led to the capture of a man authorities believe was supplying heroin and methamphetamine in the area. Nathan Robert Croyle, 43, was arrested on April 8 following an investigation by the Altoona Police Department and the Blair County Drug Taskforce into suspected drug trafficking in the city. According to police, officers were conducting surveillance near 27th Street and Maple Avenue and observed several individuals leaving a residence later identified as Croyle’s. Multiple traffic stops were made, including one involving 30-year-old Jayson Riscigno, who police said had been dropped off at the front of the home and exited through the back. During the stop, officers discovered Riscigno had an active warrant through the Blair County Sheriff’s Office. A search of his person reportedly uncovered heroin and crystal methamphetamine. Following Riscigno’s arrest, investigators obtained a search warrant for Croyle’s home. The warrant was executed by a team that included Altoona police, Logan Township police, Tyrone police, Pennsylvania State Police, detectives from the Blair County District Attorney’s Office, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office. Croyle was found in the basement and taken into custody without incident. During the search, officers reported finding 32 packets of suspected heroin with a street value of $640 on top of an air duct in the basement. Croyle is currently being held in Blair County Prison on $150,000 bail. According to a criminal complaint, Croyle was also identified as the “unknown Black male on a bicycle” accused of selling heroin to a man involved in a previous controlled buy. Riscigno, who was taken to prison on his outstanding warrant, will also face drug charges in connection to the investigation, police said.
