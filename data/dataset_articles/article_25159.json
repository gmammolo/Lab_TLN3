  "text": "Maryland Grants $10M for Clean Energy in Higher Education\nThe Maryland Energy Administration offered grants to 11 colleges and universities to install solar panels and draft strategies to incorporate renewable energy into academics and workforce preparation.\nEleven colleges and universities in Maryland will bring clean energy infrastructure and education to their campuses with help from $10 million in grants from the state.\nThe Maryland Energy Administration (MEA)\nThe news release said each grantee will develop a Clean Energy Master Plan (CEMP) for integrating new sustainability projects into existing campus initiatives, whether that be partnering with industry for hands-on student training or carefully analyzing energy use and efficiency. Schools can use MEA funds to pay student interns to help create CEMPs or install solar panels, according to the\nFor\nSome schools are also taking unique approaches to workforce development, such as Allegany Community College, which will develop a certification program in photovoltaics — the conversion of light into electricity with semiconductors like solar panels. Several University of Maryland locations will create training programs in clean energy and renewable resources.\nAccording to the news release, these initiatives will help Maryland avoid producing the equivalent of more than 2,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide, or about 15 rail cars of coal, each year.\n“So these grants will boost the state’s real clean energy output and give students hands-on opportunities to learn more about, and even begin working in, clean energy fields,” MEA Director Paul Pinsky said in a public statement.\nMEA plans to share details on the fiscal year 2026 round of Higher Education Clean Energy Grants later this summer.\nThe Maryland Energy Administration (MEA)\nannouncedlast week that the schools will join itsHigher Education Clean Energy Grant Pilot Program, a project aimed at incorporating renewable energy infrastructure into higher education sites and strategic planning, as well as academic curricula and workforce development.The news release said each grantee will develop a Clean Energy Master Plan (CEMP) for integrating new sustainability projects into existing campus initiatives, whether that be partnering with industry for hands-on student training or carefully analyzing energy use and efficiency. Schools can use MEA funds to pay student interns to help create CEMPs or install solar panels, according to the\nfunding opportunity announcement.For\nexample, Loyola University of Maryland will use its $1.2 million award to install rooftop solar panels and fund three internships. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which received a similar amount, will install a solar system on canopy structures and work with five interns.Some schools are also taking unique approaches to workforce development, such as Allegany Community College, which will develop a certification program in photovoltaics — the conversion of light into electricity with semiconductors like solar panels.
