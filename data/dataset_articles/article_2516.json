They run, jump, and drop things all day and night—literally no quiet time. We’ve tried talking to the parents multiple times, but they just brush it off like it’s nothing. We even reached out to the HOA with video proof of the noise, but they haven’t done anything. The constant disruptions are seriously taking a toll on my mental health.

They handle all the front yard and street landscaping, snow removal in winter, fence repairs, and even maintain parks and walking paths around the area. Honestly, I think it's a solid deal for the small price I pay, especially since I can't paint my house neon pink (which, let’s be real, is probably for the best 😂).
