  "text": "Metso has introduced an innovative solution, the copper POX (pressure oxidation) leaching process, to extract copper in a sustainable manner.\nMost copper ores mined are either oxides or sulfide ores, both of which require specific processes to extract the minerals from the ore.\nHowever, copper sulfide minerals require specialised leaching conditions to achieve high recovery rates, which can have a negative impact on the environment.\nThis is where Metso’s copper POX leaching process can help, as it is a hydrometallurgical method designed to treat copper sulfide concentrates at lower capacities.\nAs ore compositions change due to depletion of deposits and increasing environmental and efficiency demands, the copper POX leaching process maximises copper recovery while reducing environmental impact.\nCopper concentrate is oxidised through Metso’s proprietary OKTOP Autoclave unit, resulting in a copper-bearing pregnant leach solution (PLS) to be further treated in solvent extraction and electrowinning processes, where copper is recovered as high-purity London Metal Exchange (LME) Grade A cathodes.\nThe pre-designed process and equipment package enables a swift ramp-up to production and integrates seamlessly with solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX – EW) infrastructure.\nThe copper POX plant can be implemented to improve existing heap leaching SX – EW operations to complete depleting heap leaching PLS production.\n“Metso’s copper POX leaching utilises high-temperature oxidation to convert sulfide sulfur into sulfate and sulfuric acid, ensuring efficient copper dissolution,” Metso technology manager, copper hydrometallurgy Petteri Pesonen said .\n“This technology offers a high-performance solution with high, up to 99 per cent copper recovery rates, ensuring maximum extraction of valuable metals from the ore.\n“The process also minimises environmental impact by reducing emissions and optimising the use of resources through, for example, closed loop process steps reducing the use of water.”\nMetso also launched the next generation of its anode furnace in December, which is ideal for refining blister copper or melting and refining high-grade secondary copper into anode copper.\nSubscribe to Australian Mining and receive the latest news on product announcements, industry developments, commodities and more.",
