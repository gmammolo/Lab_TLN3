  "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The VoLo Foundation's 2025 Climate Correction Conference is back for its seventh year this week at the Celeste Hotel at the University of Central Florida to bring individuals of all ages, organizations and leading experts together to explore innovative climate solutions, with the goal of a more resilient and sustainable future.\nWhat You Need To Know The VoLo Foundation's Climate Correction Conference began Wednesday at UCF's Celeste Hotel\nThe event will continue Thursday with speaker presentations and workshops\nExperts and members of the community will work to come up with ways to help make the climate more sustainable in the future The conference is an opportunity for top climate experts, policymakers and industry leaders and the community to discuss solutions for climate change that can have real impacts in Central Florida and beyond, through workshops, training sessions and interactive events.\n\"The concept of climate correction comes from the financial meaning of when the market the prices go too high,\" said Thais Lopez Vogel, co-founder and trustee of the VoLo Foundation. \"You want to correct them before it crashes. (With climate corrections, it's) the same. The emissions are too high right now, so we want to correct them before it's too late.\n\"We know the planet is going to survive. It's the quality of life for future generations that we're trying to preserve here.\"\nWednesday's events focused on small-group activities and workshops, in which attendees could collaborate with community leaders and those who are active in the environmental sciences and sustainability fields to share ideas and come up with solutions. The sessions focus on topics like climate advocacy training.\nFilm screenings on the topics will be shown in English and Spanish and will feature discussions with the directors.\nAn art expo, where artwork will be created and be on display, also provides an opportunity to showcase the power of art in climate action. Booths and artists feature pieces with climate themes, and an art contest will reward the best work.\nWednesday wraps up with a “Trash 2 Trends” fashion show. The VIP event is a partnership with the city of Orlando that focuses on the importance of upcycling, which involves recycling to create a product of higher value than the discarded object.\nThe community events and workshops on Wednesday were free, but if anyone who wants to attend Thursday will have to pay a $100 registration fee or a $50 student registration. The agenda is available on the VoLo Foundation website .",
