  "text": "Waynesboro looks to acquire private land to extend South River Greenway\nWAYNESBORO, Va. (WHSV) - The City of Waynesboro is working to acquire private land required to connect the South River Greenway with a nearby park, but the effort has run into complications for the city.\nThe Waynesboro City Council discussed the path forward to acquiring the land needed to expand the South River Greenway from 2nd Street to Basic Park during its Monday meeting. At the meeting, a public hearing was held to discuss a resolution authorizing and directing the use of condemnation for Greenway Phase 4.\nWhile no one gave public comment, City Manager Michael Hamp read a briefing discussing attempted negotiations with the property owner, which has been unsuccessful, as the city and property owner have not come to an agreement on compensation for the transfer.\n“The city has obtained an appraisal of easements that yielded a fair market value of $4,100 and has attempted to negotiate easements with Mr. Collins. These negotiations were unsuccessful,” Hamp said at the meeting.\nWHSV reached out to the city via email for an interview, and Hamp replied, “Because this matter is scheduled to be resolved through litigation, our legal counsel has advised that the city representatives not discuss the matter.”\nCopyright 2025 WHSV.
