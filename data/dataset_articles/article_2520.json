  "text": "A MERCEDES in a dead-end street in West Bathurst had the lights on and the engine running but no-one in the driver's seat, according to police.\nThe driver, police say, was on the nature strip of a house across the road.\nLeticia Joanne Bettles, 42, of Currawong Street, South Bathurst, did not appear in Bathurst Local Court on Wednesday, April 2, 2025 to answer a charge of driving while her licence was suspended and using an unregistered Class C motor vehicle and her matters were dealt with in her absence.\nPolice documents before the court said Bettles was driving a black Mercedes east along Rocket Street towards the intersection of Gladstone Street, West Bathurst at about 12.45am on March 20, 2025.\nThe registration status of this vehicle had been cancelled since November 22, 2024 and expired since August 21, 2024, according to the police documents.\nBettles held a licence which had been disqualified.\nPolice said they were conducting patrols, saw the vehicle driving down Rocket Street and, as they passed, they conducted a U-turn in an effort to pull the vehicle over.\nAs they conducted a U-turn, Bettles accelerated and conducted a quick right-hand turn into Gladstone Street, according to police.\nGladstone Street is a dead-end road.\nPolice said they pulled into Gladstone Street and saw Bettles on the nature strip of a house across the road from the vehicle.\nThe Mercedes still had its lights on and the engine was running.\nAs police passed the vehicle, they said there was someone sitting in the front passenger seat and someone sitting in the rear passenger side seat.\nPolice said they drove the length of the street, about 50 metres, and saw no other people.\nHaving conducted a U-turn and pulled in behind the vehicle, police said they did a registration check and found that Bettles had been charged twice late in 2024 for driving the same black Mercedes with a suspended licence and driving an unregistered motor vehicle.\nBettles was arrested and taken to Bathurst Police Station.\nShe received advice from the Aboriginal Legal Service and, after this, declined to be formally interviewed.\nIn court\nMagistrate Gemma Slack-Smith dealt with Bettles' matter in the late afternoon, noting that she had not appeared by that time.\nHaving summarised the police documents, Ms Slack-Smith said she found the offence proven and noted Bettles had been before the court before for a similar offence.\nMs Slack-Smith convicted Bettles for driving while her licence was suspended, fined her $300 and disqualified her from driving for 12 months from April 2, 2025.\nTributes & Funerals Notices\nMore Tributes & Funerals Notices",
