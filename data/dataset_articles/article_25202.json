  "text": "LA County offers mental health help after firestorms\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health is reminding people dealing with the psychological fallout of January’s firestorms that help is available through its helpline.\nDirector Lisa Wong said many people seeking urgent counseling through their private insurance may be facing long wait times because of a long-standing mental health worker shortage.\n“Now you have this huge disaster that requires a very specific kind of trauma response, and that network of therapists still is not going to be adequate,” Wong said Wednesday.\nWong said the department is working to connect people with therapists, support groups and other services while they wait for longer-term support through insurers.\nThe department also offers a service called iPrevail, where people can get support from people with lived experience with mental health conditions.\nThe helpline is available 24-hours a day, seven days a week at (800) 854-7771.\nA full list of L.A. County mental health resources for people affected by wildfires is online.\n-\nExperts say parents should validate feelings and create avenues for kids to express themselves.\n-\nThe new COVID-19 vaccine is rolling out. Here's a guide on when and how to get it.\n-\nFour years after SARS-CoV2 sparked a devastating global pandemic, U.S. health officials now consider COVID-19 an endemic disease.\n-\nA medical industry challenge to a $25 minimum wage ordinance in one Southern California city suggests health workers statewide could face layoffs and reductions in hours and benefits under a state law set to begin phasing in in June. Some experts are skeptical, however, that it will have such effects.\n-\nHealth officials estimate more than 685,000 people in L.A. County have latent tuberculosis, where they aren't sick and are not contagious. One in 10 develop active tuberculosis, with symptoms. Both stages are curable with antibiotics. But it's best to catch it early.\n-\nThe clubhouse model offers a place for people living with mental illness to grow and recover in community. Research has shown they can lead to good outcomes.",
