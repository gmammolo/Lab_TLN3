  "text": "The historic garden expands its 70-year firefly viewing tradition with a new scenic walkway.\nTOKYO, 13 March, 2025 Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo, a luxury urban resort known for its historic Japanese garden, has announced the opening of its Firefly Path. Designed to enhance the hotel’s renowned firefly viewing experience, which begins mid-May, the new promenade offers guests an immersive way to enjoy the fireflies while preserving the garden’s serene landscape.\nFirefly viewing has been a signature experience at Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo since 1954, making it one of Tokyo's premier locations for enjoying this seasonal tradition. The garden, which is carefully maintained to support the delicate firefly ecosystem, sees approximately 10,000 fireflies lighting up the evening during peak season.\nIn Japan, fireflies represent fleeting nature, much like cherry blossoms in spring. They have become increasingly scarce in cities, making Chinzanso Garden a rare urban sanctuary for the species. The hotel’s sustainable practices have been key to preserving the insect’s population for more than seven decades.\nChinzanso Garden at night during firefly season, featuring the Three-Story Pagoda and the Tokyo Sea of Clouds\nThe Firefly Path has been designed to elevate the viewing experience without compromising the garden’s aesthetics. Winding through the most frequented firefly habitats, the path offers multiple vantage points for guests to observe their glow.\nThe project reflects the hotel’s commitment to balancing heritage with innovation. ‘Firefly viewing has been a cherished tradition at Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo for over 70 years’, said Tomohiko Chihiro, General Manager of Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo. ‘We are excited to welcome guests to the Firefly Path, where they can experience this tradition in an enhanced way.’\nThe 2025 firefly season will run from 16 May to 30 June, accompanied by experiences for guests to enjoy alongside their garden visit. The hotel will offer a package that comes with an after-hours firefly tour, providing a more intimate experience. Seasonal dining options, including a buffet featuring the flavours of early summer, will also be available. Children under 12 dining at the buffet will receive a complimentary firefly guidebook as a souvenir.\nThe Firefly Path will be accessible to hotel guests and restaurant patrons, with reservations recommended for those interested in dining experiences. Further details about the garden and experiences can be found on the hotel’s website.\nPrime Superior Room overlooking the garden at Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo\nAbout us:\nAbout Hotel Chinzanso Tokyo\nHotel Chinzanso Tokyo is one of the city’s most iconic luxury hotels with over 70 years of history.
