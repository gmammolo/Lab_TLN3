  "text": "ESCAMBIA COUNTY, Fla. (WKRG) – 70 acres smoldered on University of West Florida property along Pate Street, serving a purpose. Firefighters with Florida Forest Service conducted a prescribed burn Wednesday, bringing a number of benefits to the area “If we burn it on our terms when it’s safe to do so it’s not going to catch fire when we don’t want it to. It’s not going to affect the houses, it’s not going to affect the communities in the area. Life and property is our first priorities,” Joe Zwierzchowski, Public Information Officer for Florida Forest Service said. The fire is also crucial for many species native to the area. “This landscape just like the rest of Florida really is a fire dependent if not fire adaptive ecosystem so it needs fire in order to thrive, and these thicker woods in the urban areas haven’t seen fire in decades,” Zwierzchowski said. “We have our beloved gopher tortoises here which is a Florida threatened species and without fire in their habitat they can’t really move around and it’s a lot harder to find their food sources and for their food sources to propagate and make new sources for them,” Chasidy Hobbs, Director of Conservation at University of West Florida said. But certain conditions need to be in place before a prescribed burn can happen. “We have to get the right weather window so that we’re getting a good clean burn in the understory. It’s not too hot that we’re killing trees. It’s not too wet that we’re really not having any affect and we really want to make sure most importantly that the smoke is blowing towards the rive away from the subdivisions, away from the homes, away from highway 90,” Zwierzchowski said. Crews also monitor and patrol the area keeping a close eye on any potential smoke impacts during the burn. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WKRG News 5.",
