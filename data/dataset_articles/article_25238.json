  "text": "Efforts in the 35th Clean Up Australia Day were successful, with groups participating in the annual event across 26 sites in St George.\nGeorges River Council supported volunteers and helped remove over 1.42 tonnes of litter collected from parks, streets, and creeks.\nFrom community groups, childcare centres and club centres to schools, gardens, parks and wetlands, people gloved up and got their hands dirty to spruce the environment.\nItems collected included plastic drink bottles and bags, disposable coffee cups, cigarette butts and polystyrene.\nThe more unusual items included a basketball stand, children's toys, balls, a surf ski, a surfboard cover, car parts, tyres, and cash.\nGeorges River Council mayor Elise Borg said seeing so many people volunteer was impressive.\n\"[Their] dedication and hard work significantly impact keeping Georges River beautiful,\" she said. \" It's inspiring to see so many individuals coming together with a shared vision for a cleaner, greener future.\"\nClean Up Australia Day has become the nation's largest community-based environmental event, held annually on the first Sunday in March.",
