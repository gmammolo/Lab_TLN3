  "text": "Manasota Key Road to get new facelift after being wiped away by storms\nSARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - What was once a beautiful stretch of Manasota Key Road in Sarasota was ravaged by back-to-back hurricane seasons in 2023 and 2024. Rubble remains littered on the beach during spring break nearly five months after the last storm.\nVenice resident Diane Reidy tried to enjoy her beach day, but she can’t help but think of the inconveniences that lie ahead – during the construction of the new road – every time she looks at it. Diane is worried about the missing road delaying drive times to and from the area and the unsightly rubble on the beach.\nThe view might take a while to improve. The County saying says it’ll be years until a permanent road is built.\nThe Department of Transportation has an agreement with the county that design plans should be done around July 2027 – followed by another two years of construction.\nAnd though it might take a while, Sarasota County Public Works Director Spencer Anderson wants to make sure the road is rebuilt better than ever.\nAnderson will be meeting with commissioners on March 26 to discuss the plans further.\nCopyright 2025 WWSB.
