  "text": "Monday\nHello,\nWe're aware of an emerging issue impacting Chromecast 2nd gen and Chromecast Audio devices, and we are working on a fix.\nDo not factory reset your device - we will keep you all updated when the fix rolls out. If you have already factory reset your device, we will provide instructions to set your device back up as soon as possible.\nThank you for your patience.\nAnswered!\nGo to the Recommended Answer.\nyesterday\nHi all,\nAn update on the situation: the team has identified the cause of the issue impacting Chromecast (2nd gen) and Chromecast Audio devices.\nPlease do not factory reset your device. If you previously performed a factory reset during troubleshooting, you may also be experiencing an issue where you're unable to re-setup your device. The team has identified the cause for this as well and is currently working on a fix.\nWe’re working to resolve this as soon as possible, and will keep you updated when there is more to share.\nWe sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, and appreciate your patience in the meantime.\nThank you.\n11m ago\nI agree and wonder how this will be rectified. i am not really confident it will be fixed without asking the device owner to do some custom weird workflow.\n13m ago\nMillions.\nyesterday\nClaro una certificación que Google \"olvido\" renovar..\nyesterday\nHello my friend. I think is not so easy. Google stopped selling Chromecast devices and they decided to stopped to support it.\nyesterday\nstop support is one thing, enter in my home and destroy silently, without adivise me in advance is another.\n8 hours ago\nNo se lo cree nadie verdad\nyesterday\nMust be easy to fix ...\nyesterday\nOne would think so, but the issue is now at least 24 hours old and there's no sign of a fix from Google. I went to Argos today and bought the Amazon Firestick HD.\nyesterday\nLOL\nyesterday\nPlease let me know if you know a way to cast to it from a Google phone\nyesterday\nIf the cert becomes past due and a new product is on the horizon?\nyesterday\nOui le certificat SSL ils ont oublié de faire la MAJ pour les Chromecast\n16 hours ago\nThere are a lot of chinese clones on Amazon and AliBaba - I'll buy one of those instead.\n8 hours ago\nI renew certificates everyday, would they like me to take over?\n7 hours ago\nIt really doesn’t matter what the specific cause was, just that the outage is due to a problem at Google and there is nothing a user can do but complain.\nan expired certificate would indeed be an unforgivable mistake by a company such as Google, if indeed that’s the root cause. Imagine if Google mail went down for all customers because of an expired certificate? This would make the nightly news and Google executives would be brought before Congress to account—and that from a service that most Americans use for free.\ni truly don’t believe a a certificate was really to blame. It’d be fixed by now if that were the only reason. A company like Google doesn’t let certificates expire unless they want to.\nbut again, the cause is internal to Google. While interesting to those of us in the tech world, the users are not meant to care why. Users just want things to work. In the grand scheme of things why is way down the list to most users since users cannot fix the issue on their own.\n7 hours ago\nIn this day and age, a root certificate should never need to be maintained by humans. This should 100% be automated! I am floored that Google was affected by this.\nan hour ago\n10 year certs are reasonable. There just needs to be a way to move over to a newer cert. Almost no end user can, nor should have to, mess around with this. Power off and power on should be the process, but it's not yet available.\nMonday\nToo late for to say DO NOT FACTORY RESET YOUR DEVICE LoL\nMonday\nyes dear, same here, i have reset it, now what will happen...\nMonday\nHope they send information out when this is fixed. I have also factory reset it.\nyesterday\nI too factory reset it\n15 hours ago\nWe all factory reset it because that’s what googles troubleshooting guide told us to do.\nyesterday\nGoogle has acknowledged the problem and is actively working on a fix. In the meantime, some users have found a temporary workaround by resetting their Chromecast and manually setting their phone's date to a day before the issue began (prior to March 9, 2025). This method has allowed them to add the device back using the Google Home app.\nyesterday\nReally? Could I do that? As many of us here, I have factory reseted my device. I don't think it matters too much but if not, will we have any problem to update our devices later?\n8 hours ago\nIt said on here NOT to factory reset your device. So I don’t think anything will work for you now . You’ll need the steps the reverse the factory reset\nyesterday\nAdd the device back but still can't actually stream anything\nyesterday\nverrry interesting\nyesterday\nOk super powerfull.\nI have change the date to 1 march and reset , restart and make the attach beetween chromecast 2 and my phone.\nyesterday\nAll is ok when i keep a date before the 8 march\nyesterday\nI don't want to have my iPhone with another date. I have to know which date is today.\n11 hours ago\nU can change it back straight after\n8 hours ago\nCan you have an iPhone?\n8 hours ago\nThat is not good though is it\nyesterday\nHow do you go back in date on settings?\nyesterday\ndont do anything, it is a google issue\nyesterday\nIf you have an android device just open settings and search for date. You'll see a toggle switch to turn off auto and then you can manually set the date and time under that.\nyesterday - last edited yesterday\nIt's the date setting on your phone/tablet (whichever you're using for the Google Home app), not the Chromecast.\nOn your Android device (I'm on v12 of the OS), go to \"Settings\" >> \"System\" >> \"Date & time\", toggle \"Set time automatically\" to the off position, tap \"Date\", and use the calendar dialogue to select a date prior to March 9th.\nIt's also probably a good idea to stop and clear the cache of the Google Home app prior to changing the date, if this process doesn't work the first time.\nGood luck!\nyesterday\nThank you. I've tried this before and it still doesn't allow me to cast only to connect the device unless I follow additional steps to by pass the authentication.\n5 hours ago\nDid it work? I changed the date on the phone after reset,it is there,but the same errors appear when I try to cast...a certain code on netflix,an untrusted device on youtube,nothing happens on max...they ruined this out of negligence or a desperate need for money. It seems billionaires are desperate for more money...\nyesterday\nHo provato,non funziona",
