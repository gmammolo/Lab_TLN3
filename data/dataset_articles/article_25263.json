  "text": "It's the much loved and highly anticipated day when the farmers, growers, producers, winemakers, brewers, distillers and flavour-makers across the famous region open their gates to celebrate where food comes from. From kissing a camel, to tasting Rozella Jams and more at Vanberry Jam Co and Cottage, to fresh produce straight from the paddocks of local farms, picnic selfies with alpacas, stocking up on artisan dairy products and learning more about farming, beer tasting at the new Boxer Brewing on Tamborine Mountain, flower walks at Elderflower Farm, wandering the vines at the region's award-winning vineyards, visitors leave with full stomachs and a love for the Scenic Rim region, its produce and its people.\nTAMBORINE MOUNTAIN DISTILLERY, which is the most awarded distillery in the COUNTRY, is launching TWO NEW SIPS for the Trail – their own Yuzu Gin and Yuzu Vodka!\nHead Distiller, Gordon Chalmers, first discovered YUZU while working in Japan a decade ago. Captivated by its vibrant, complex flavour and aromatic depth, he was inspired to create Yuzucello three years ago.. The overwhelming response, led him to develop both Yuzu Gin and Yuzu Vodka, each capturing the bright, zesty essence of this extraordinary fruit. In line with their sustainability commitment, the team has planted 58 citrus trees, including 25 yuzu trees, on the property to ensure a reliable, sustainable supply of yuzu for the distilling process.\n2025 Scenic Rim Farm Gate Trail: Sunday March 30, 9am to 3pm",
