  "text": "How Cyrill Gutsch changes the way we use fossil fuel plastics\nIn this final episode of the season, Afdhel and Bobby speak with environmentalist and founder of Parley for the Oceans, Cyrill Gutsch. Through brand partnerships, Parley's mission is to change the way we use fossil fuel plastics. We hear the variety of ways in which Parley are tackling the deadly contamination of the planet’s most important ecosystems; our oceans.\nWe believe that business and culture can be forces of good. But creators and entrepreneurs alike are still struggling to find the right model that allows them to impact real social change. In this series, Bobby Jones and Afdhel Aziz sit down with an extraordinary lineup of luminaries from the worlds of fashion, film, art, music and activism, who all believe in using business and culture as forces for good.\nIn each episode, you'll learn how bold creative actions can change the world for the better through interviews with the trailblazers who are doing it every day. Recorded in the inviting Soho House in 2018, this podcast series delves into many unique stories and the one thing they all have in common – the desire and the courage to transform our world for the better.",
