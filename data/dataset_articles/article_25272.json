  "text": "PAWNEE COUNTY, Okla. — Two grassfires that led to evacuations in Pawnee County have been contained and residents are now back in town.\nFOX23 was on the site of one of those fires on Tuesday night in Terlton.\nBoth grassfires in Jennings and Terlton wrapped up just before midnight on Wednesday morning. They were about 35 minutes away from Tulsa.\nCrews for both towns were originally in Terlton, but Jennings Fire Department was quicky pulled back for their own fire.\n\"We're just doing a little bit of mop up and checking on hot spots today,” said Tommy Matthews, Jennings Fire Department.\nWhile controlling some of the remaining hot spots, fire crews with Jennings gave an update on where they're currently at. They told FOX23 that only two shed-like structures were lost.\n\"It's all contained, it's all extinguished, we are just monitoring to make sure there's no flare ups over night or in the coming days. There was a mandatory evacuation within a half mile of here, but everyone's back home and no injuries to my knowledge,” Matthews said.\nBruce and Dorothy live in the area. They were one of the families who were told to evacuate.\n\"We left at about 2:00 yesterday afternoon and got back around 8,” said Bruce who lives in Jennings. \"These people here burnt something on the other side of the building and it just took off from them and it took off that way. I don't know how far it went that way. It happens almost every year, somebody burns something and it gets out of control. When the wind is blowing, don't burn nothing, just don't.”\nFOX23 then went back to Terlton to find the fire that was right outside of town. It also forced a few people to evacuate.\nThere was no structure damage to the Terlton fire. FOX23 only found what looked like a vehicle lost to the flames.\nFox23 spoke with the Terlton Fire Department off camera and they said it's all just smoldering there just like Jennings.\nNo one knows the cause yet behind these fires, only that dry and windy conditions made it worse.\nThey said they're just buckling up for high winds on Friday and warning the public to not burn anything when it's dry and windy outside.",
