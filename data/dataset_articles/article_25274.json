  "text": "A curious white pointer shark has been snapped getting up close and personal with a research team's underwater camera equipment in Fiordland.\nDepartment of Conservation staff and researchers from Sea Through Science were carrying out a baited remote underwater video (BRUV) survey in Fiordland's Tamatea/Dusky Sound in February when the shark was seen sniffing around - and mouthing - a bait pot attached to the equipment.\nSea Through Science researcher Adam Smith, who was contracted to undertake the work said it was \"quite a shock\" to see the curious mature male pointer shark getting so close to the BRUV cameras.\n\"The stereo BRUV uses two GoPro cameras in underwater housings. At the end of the day, we download the footage back on the boat to see what has been attracted.\n\"We had been laughing about how cool it would be to see something like that. It's very rare to get such great footage,\" he said.\nThe team collected over 200 hours of footage to analyse the abundance and diversity of fish species in the fiords, including several key species such as hāpuku, blue cod, octopus and many shark species.\nDOC Senior Ranger, Richard Kinsey said the surveys allowed researchers to compare fish inside and outside the marine reserves, and record how fish numbers change over time.\n\"This information will also be helpful for assessing whether Fiordland's new fishing regulations benefit fish stocks in the coming years,\" he said.\nGreat white sharks are endangered, and protected under the Wildlife Act and the Fisheries Act.\n\"It's great to see these majestic creatures in their natural environment and to see how curious they are around the BRUVs,\" said Smith. \"We've only seen a white shark once before during our surveys, at the Kermadec Islands, the other end of New Zealand.\"\nDOC encouraged the public to report details of any sightings, captures or strandings of great white sharks to 0800 DOC HOT.",
