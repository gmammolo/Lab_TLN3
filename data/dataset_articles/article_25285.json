  "text": "Volunteers from Cenla businesses team up to keep Louisiana beautiful\nALEXANDRIA, La. (KALB) - Volunteers from various businesses in Central Louisiana are coming together to help keep the state beautiful through the South Alexandria Litter Campaign.\nThe campaign highlights the need for more work to keep the streets of Alexandria clean. Local businesses, including Coca-Cola, along with churches, have been actively involved in cleaning the streets for years. Volunteers emphasize how important these efforts are to maintaining a clean and beautiful community.\nSean Pickins, a volunteer and president of Epsilon Chi Omega Psi Phi, encourages people to get involved.\n“Get up, get out, and be active. Reach out to your local community service centers, churches, and leaders, political and religious. Have the mindset of helping others and doing something positive for your community,” he said.\nMark Cowart, a volunteer and sales manager at Alexandria Coca-Cola, shared a similar goal.\n“We aim to lead by example, talk about recycling and encourage actions like a poster contest,” she said. “We want to make cleaning up a year-round effort, just like the ‘Love the Boot’ initiative in Louisiana.”\nBoth volunteers hope to inspire others to take pride in their community.\n“It’s important to show pride in where we live. We want to share the history of our community with the youth so they can take pride in it too,” Pickins said. “So many great people have come from here, and it’s important for us to give back.”\nMark Cowart added, “When we come together as a team, whether it’s a business, community or school, it creates a strong sense of teamwork throughout Rapides Parish and the state.”\nFor more information or to get involved with the South Alexandria Revitalization Campaign, contact Roosevelt L. Johnson at 318-613-0219.\nClick here to report a typo. Please provide the title of the article in your email.\nCopyright 2025 KALB. All rights reserved.",
