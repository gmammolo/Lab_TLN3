  "text": "VENICE — A new state program has funds that eligible property owners can use to protect their homes from natural disasters. Elevate Florida, under the Florida Division of Emergency Management, is open to applicants who are: 18 or older; U.S. citizens; the legal property owner of a residential property in the state of Florida; and able to contribute up to 25% percent of the project’s total cost, according to the program’s web page at https://fdem-resmit.my.site.com/Elevate. There are four project options: Structure elevationMitigation reconstruction — construction of an improved, elevated building on the same site where an existing building or foundation has been partially or completely demolished or destroyed. Reconstruction is the alternative to structure elevation when the structure is not sound enough to elevate.Acquisition/demolition — purchase and demolition of a property from voluntary sellers, to be maintained by the local community as open spaceWind mitigation Multi-family properties and manufactured homes may be eligible for funding, but all properties must be owned by individuals. A property need not have experienced flooding or damage in the past, but a history of loss might be considered in the review process. Renters may not apply directly but owners of rental property may. Secondary residences may be considered if sufficient funding is available. To apply, set up an account at the Elevate Florida portal. Completing the application will take about 20 minutes. Have the following items available: Photos of all four sides of the structureYour insurance declaration pages, if availableElevation certificates, if applicableSoil studies, if applicableFlooding photos or high water mark photosInsurance claim informationSubstantial damage determination letters from local government, if applicableCombined income as reflected on the most recent federal tax return According to the website, the process is estimated to take one to two years, including one to four months for application review; two to three months for decision and approval: three to nine months for construction; and one to three months for closeout.",
