  "text": "HUDSON, N.H. — A two-car collision in Hudson on Monday night caused an SUV, driven by a Lowell resident, to crash into a home after police said the driver appeared to have run a red light.\nThe Hudson Police said there were no injuries at the scene and they are continuing to investigate the incident, which occurred at about 10 p.m. at the intersection of Ferry and Library streets.\nAccording to police, a white Buick sedan, driven by 20-year-old Bonne Panguere, of Lowell, was traveling east on Ferry Street when it went through a red light, colliding with a silver Volkswagen SUV that was heading north on Library Street. The impact sent the Buick into the corner of a nearby residence, damaging the structure.\nPolice and personnel from the Hudson Fire Department provided care to those involved at the scene.\nPolice said they have ruled out impairment as being a factor in the crash, but the case remains open for further investigation. Anyone who may have witnessed the crash is encouraged to contact Officer Corinne Blanchard at 603-886-6011.\nFollow Aaron Curtis on X @aselahcurtis, or on Bluesky @aaronscurtis.bsky.social.",
