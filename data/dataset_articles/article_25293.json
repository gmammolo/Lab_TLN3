  "text": "Astera plastic recycling facility relocated after Fruita resident’s concerns\nThe relocation comes after Astera held a community informational meeting in early March, where Fruita residents expressed health concerns related to toxic material.\nGRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (KJCT) -A plastic recycling facility will no longer be built on 19 Road in Fruita.\nInstead, Astera’s proposed plastic conversion facility will be relocated to an industrial zone in Grand Junction. The company didn’t provide a specific location.\n“We are hopeful that our decision is made known and that those in the Fruita area continue to educate themselves and support our sincere efforts to address and arrest the very real health problems associated with plastic disposal in the landfills in our nation,” said Robert Switzer, Chairman of Astera.\nThe relocation comes after Astera held a community informational meeting in early March, where Fruita residents expressed health concerns related to toxic material.\nCopyright 2025 KKCO.
