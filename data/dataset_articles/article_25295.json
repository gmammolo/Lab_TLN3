  "text": "It’s been more than two months since the first of a series of deviating wildfires rocked Southern California, and the residents from those areas are still feeling its effects.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers spurred into action last month, and now Mookie Betts is doing his part to help the victims of the wildfires, donating $30,000 worth of shoes and other apparel through his 50/50 Foundation.\nThe mission of Betts’ foundation is focused on helping children excel in their pursuits by putting them in the best possible position to do so, both in and outside of sports.\nThey aim to accomplish that through the foundation’s commitment to building groundbreaking sports programs for underrepresented youth and a specific focus on providing resources in the realms of physical activity, nutrition, mental health, and financial literacy.\nBetts is the latest example of the entire Dodgers organization’s commitment to giving back to the community at a time where people need it the most. There have been countless examples over the months since the wildfires began, and current and former Dodgers players have each contributed to the recovery efforts.\nDodgers ownership has been at the forefront as well, raising money , donating resources, and even making a $100 million pledge to the LA Rises Initiative through owner Mark Walter and the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation.\nMookie Betts nominated for 2024 Roberto Clemente Award The work that Betts and his wife Brianna have accomplished since establishing the 5050 Foundation in 2021 resulted with his first nomination for the Roberto Clemente Award last season. Betts also orchestrates his ’50 Feeds LA’ program, with more than $300,000 in contributions to feed thousands of Angelenos in South L.A. over the past three holiday seasons.\nBetts’ work with UCLA Children’s Hospital, Brotherhood Crusade, Crete Academy, financial literacy workshops at local high schools, are just some of many instances where he has served the community.\nHave you subscribed to the Dodger Blue YouTube channel ?
