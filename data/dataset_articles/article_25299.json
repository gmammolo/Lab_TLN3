  "text": "MC launches fogging drive\nTo prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria, the Municipal Corporation (MC) has initiated a fogging drive across all wards. Mayor Jatinder Singh Moti Bhatia said fogging would be conducted regularly to ensure the well-being of residents.\nThe drive has been proven effective in reducing mosquito population and minimising the risk of disease transmission.\nBy making fogging a regular feature, the corporation aims to create a safer environment for its residents, he said, adding that the proactive step demonstrates the MC’s commitment to protecting public health, particularly during these months.\nVector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria are a significant threat to human health and there is a need to take preventive measures.",
