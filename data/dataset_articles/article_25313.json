  "text": "‘Majority’ of gasoline spill in southern Boone County removed\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. (KMIZ)\nThe Missouri Department of Natural Resources says that the majority of a gasoline spill that occurred on Saturday morning has been removed.\nDNR Environmental Services Program Chief Sean Counihan wrote in a Wednesday email that between 1,000-1,100 gallons of gasoline was spilled.\n“I understand that the majority of the contaminated soils have been removed from the site, with a small area of soil contamination that is being completed today,” he wrote.\nCrews worked to remove the spill on Tom Bass Road near Route H that was caused by a semi-truck flipping. The accident caused road closures on Saturday.\n“We met with the company representatives and the contractor that they hired to conduct the remediation, formulated a plan, and work began right away,” Counihan wrote. “The initial focus was to prevent the gasoline from migrating any further than it already had. Berms and petroleum absorbents were placed in strategic areas to prevent migration.”",
