  "text": "Hong Kong- /\nRenewable Energy- /\n- SEHK:836\nChina Resources Power Holdings Company Limited (HKG:836) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry\nWhile some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of China Resources Power Holdings Company Limited (HKG:836).\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n Check out our latest analysis for China Resources Power Holdings\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for China Resources Power Holdings is:\n13% = HK$15b ÷ HK$111b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each HK$1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made HK$0.13 in profit.\nDoes China Resources Power Holdings Have A Good Return On Equity?\nArguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, China Resources Power Holdings has a superior ROE than the average (7.8%) in the Renewable Energy industry.\nThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for China Resources Power Holdings.\nWhy You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROE\nMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.\nCombining China Resources Power Holdings' Debt And Its 13% Return On Equity\nChina Resources Power Holdings clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.66. While its ROE is respectable, it is worth keeping in mind that there is usually a limit as to how much debt a company can use. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.\nConclusion\nReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\nBut when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nIf you're looking to trade China Resources Power Holdings, open an account with the lowest-cost platform trusted by professionals, Interactive Brokers.\nWith clients in over 200 countries and territories, and access to 160 markets, IBKR lets you trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds and funds from a single integrated account.\nEnjoy no hidden fees, no account minimums, and FX conversion rates as low as 0.03%, far better than what most brokers offer.\nSponsored ContentNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts\nOur new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities.\n• Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n• Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n• High growth Tech and AI Companies\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.\nExplore Now for Free\nHave feedback on this article?
