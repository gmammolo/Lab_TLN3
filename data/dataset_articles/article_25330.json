  "text": "Living\nSanta Cruz City Council adopts noise ordinance, 5-year West Cliff Roadmap\nSANTA CRUZ - Among the actions taken at its meeting Tuesday, the Santa Cruz City Council approved four new city ordinances, finalized the 5-year Roadmap for West Cliff and gave the green light to an educator workforce housing project on the Westside.\nFollowing the meeting's general public comment period, the City Council tackled its consent agenda, which consists of items that are voted on in one motion unless a councilmember or community member requests to pull an agenda item to be considered separately from the rest.\nAmong the items on the consent agenda was one to appropriate $900,000 from the city's local Measure D funds to be used in the completion of the second phase of the Coastal Rail Trail's Segment 7. The second phase of the Segment 7 project will complete 2.1 miles of the rail trail between Natural Bridges Drive and the Santa Cruz Wharf.\n\"It's great to hear that Phase 2 of the Rail Trail will soon be completed - connecting together with Phase 1 over 30,000 residents in our city from Natural Bridges to Pacific Avenue - to an active transportation corridor that leads to schools, workplaces, beaches, shopping and other activities,\" said Santa Cruz City Councilmember Scott Newsome at the meeting. \"I just wanted to thank our Public Works Department and particularly Director (Nathan) Nguyen for all of their hard work on this project.\"\nSanta Cruz City Hall. (Aric Sleeper – Santa Cruz Sentinel)\nBecause of intense winter storms in 2023 and 2024, the site of the Phase 2 trail, adjacent to Neary Lagoon, was inundated with groundwater, which led to delays and additional costs, according to the item's agenda report. The report notes that, \"If less funds are required, they will remain usable by other Measure D eligible projects.\"\nFollowing the approval of the consent agenda, the governing body considered the meeting's consent public hearings, which included the introduction of an ordinance regarding street vendors and final approvals of three city ordinances, including one to reduce \"unreasonably disturbing noises\" in the city.\nAccording to the ordinance, \"The City Council desires to set objective standards to create a community understanding about unreasonably loud noise and to foster an environment of mutual respect, while at the same time promoting self-expression.\"\nUnder the ordinance, \"unreasonably disturbing noises\" are determined by a number of factors including the volume and intensity of the noise, music or related sound and the duration, continuousness or repetitive nature of the noise, music or related sound, among other criteria.\nSomeone can be cited for a violation of the ordinance if \"the noise producing source is on public property in a commercial zone, amplified noise and/or repetitive banging or percussive noises that can be heard 125 or more feet from the noise-producing source are presumptively unreasonably loud or disturbing as prohibited by this section. This presumption, however, shall not apply to permitted amplification or percussion used in special events or performances permitted by the city.\"\nThe ordinance specifically calls out the unpermitted use of amplified equipment and \"sound trucks\" in the city. Those using amplified equipment or sound trucks can be cited on public or private property if the disruptive noise can be heard near municipal facilities or between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., among other criteria.\nCouncilmembers Susie O'Hara and Gabriella Trigueiro both voted against the passage of the noise ordinance, which was ultimately approved in a 4-to-2 vote.\nThe final item on the City Council's agenda was the consideration of the city's 5-year Roadmap for West Cliff, which has been in the works following the council's adoption of the 50-year Vision for West Cliff last April. The 5-year plan was developed with community feedback to prioritize short-term projects that help to actualize the longer term vision.\nThe final draft of the 5-year roadmap prioritized five projects to be completed in the near term, with the Revetment Repair Project taking top priority followed by the Lighthouse Field Roadway Relocation. Subsequent projects include the Santa Cruz Coastal Change Monitoring Network project, the West Cliff Infrastructure Financing Feasibility Study and the Corridor-wide Master Signage Plan and Design Standards project taking fifth place on the list. The roadmap document includes detailed descriptions and tentative timelines for each project.\n\"It's really important to note that the five projects in the 5-year Roadmap are not the only projects that will be going on on West Cliff,\" said Assistant City Manager Michelle Templeton. \"This is just a very focused approach to kicking off the (50-year) vision.\"\nThe City Council approved the adoption of the document in a unanimous vote.\nTo watch the meeting, visit cityofsantacruz.com.\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
