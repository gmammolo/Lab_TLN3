View as early and evolving AI art!\nBlades turn to surfboards,\nRecycled waves ride anew,\nNature's bond preserved.\nAcciona, Draft Surf launch surfboard crafted from recycled turbine blades via DDB Group Melbourne\nAcciona has partnered with DDB Group Melbourne to launch the inaugural product from its 'Turbine Made' initiative, which aims to repurpose retired wind turbine blades into new materials and products. The first product to emerge from this initiative is a surfboard, crafted from recycled wind turbine blades, co-designed with Australian professional surfer Josh Kerr and his team at Draft Surf.\nThe surfboard, which was unveiled on Seven Network's Sunrise, has also been featured in publications such as Swellnet and Surfer Magazine. It is manufactured by transforming retired fibreglass turbine blades into 'Turbine Made' particulate, which Draft Surf then utilises to create high-performance surfboards. This initiative seeks to prevent turbine blades from ending up in landfill and to promote sustainability in product manufacturing.\nThe surfboard underwent testing at Acciona's Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm, where it demonstrated strong performance under challenging conditions. An event held at URBNSURF in Sydney provided media, influencers, and the public with the opportunity to try out the 'Turbine Made' surfboard.\nExecutive Creative Director at DDB Group Melbourne, Giles Watson, said: \"Surfers have an unbreakable bond with the environment, so creating a board from recycled turbine blades helps inspire the next generation of environmentalists. Beyond being bloody cool, this project proves that sustainability and performance can go hand in hand—opening the door for a wave of new possibilities with Turbine Made.\"\nGeneral Manager Brand & Marketing at Acciona, Caroline Pinter, said: \"Acciona has long been connected to the surfing community. At our first wind farm in Navarra, Spain, local surfboard shapers helped repair turbine blades because of their expertise in fiberglass. This surfboard continues that shared history and reinforces our commitment to making the circular economy a reality.\"\nDraft Surf's Kerr said: \"The conditions at Cathedral Rocks pushed the surfboards to their limits and they held up beautifully and performed great. The Turbine Made particulate is extremely durable and lightweight, making it ideal to use in our performance surfboards.\"\nThe 'Turbine Made' initiative is part of a broader effort to encourage businesses and individuals to incorporate recycled wind turbine material into their products. Acciona is actively seeking new partnerships to develop additional 'Turbine Made' products. The project is supported by an integrated campaign and apparel featuring art by illustrator Jake Foreman.\nPartner Content From Klaviyo\nKlaviyo B2C CRM. A new era in consumer relationships is here.
