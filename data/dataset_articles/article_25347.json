  "text": "Columbia Gas offers safety tips for Severe Weather Awareness Week\nHARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV) - Like every other appliance in a home, natural gas appliances and lines are at risk during severe weather, but protection steps can be taken to secure them during harsh weather.\nMarch 10-14 is Severe Weather Awareness Week in Virginia. Jennifer Montague, president and chief operating officer of Columbia Gas of Virginia, said unpredictable weather can’t be controlled, but damages in the home can be prepared for and potentially avoided if the right steps are taken.\n“In Virginia, some of the severe weather threats we face in the spring include thunderstorms, flooding and tornadoes, so get ready now,” Montague said.\nSome tips Columbia Gas encourages customers to follow are:\n- Have an emergency plan and practice it with your family.\n- Label gas valves, water valves and electricity main switches. Teach responsible family members how and when to turn them off.\n- Store any flammable liquids, such as gasoline, paint and cleaning products, away from any natural gas appliance with a pilot light.\n- If your appliances have been impacted by severe weather, do not attempt to place natural gas appliances back in service yourself. A qualified professional should check, clean, repair and test all gas appliances and pipes.\n- If you smell the sulfur-like “rotten egg” odor of natural gas or think there may be a gas leak, stop what you are doing, leave the area immediately and then call 911 and the Columbia Gas emergency line at 1-800-544-5606.\nMontague emphasized the importance of maintaining gas meters around the home. She said people sometimes don’t understand the importance of keeping them visible and clear, especially when emergency work needs to be done.\n“Don’t let debris build up around the natural gas meter. Sometimes in people’s basements, they have stuff all piled around it, so we want to make sure people don’t do that,” Montague said. “If it’s outside, some people might build nice gardens around it, we really want to make sure nobody does that.”\nCopyright 2025 WHSV.
