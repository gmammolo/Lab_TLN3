  "text": "Alex Raymond Kordahl\nAlex Raymond Kordahl, 28, of Fargo, ND, formerly of Duluth, MN, passed away March 21, 2025. Alex was born September 16, 1996 to Joel and Judy Kordahl in Duluth, MN. In 2015, he graduated from East High School and went on to attend North Dakota University and North Dakota State University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in 2020. Alex enjoyed playing soccer, golf, ping pong, beating his dad at darts, and playing hockey with his brother Erik and friends at the Geneson Rink. He loved animals - his favorite pet was a pug he named Isabelle. Alex loved going to “The Cabin” in Barnes, WI, spending time with family, and, of course, Grandma Rantala’s cinnamon rolls. His trips to “The Farm” in Mora, MN to visit Grandma Kordahl and family, and to dine on grandma’s feasts were treasured times. Alex is survived by his parents Joel and Judy of Duluth, MN; his brother Erik (Katelyn LeBlanc) of Hayward, WI; Paul (Gloria) Kaste, parents of Gretchen, Garth, and Karl; Joy (Dale) Ridgely of Minneapolis, MN; Becky (Robin Boulton) Kordahl of Madison, WI; Judith (James Fitzsimmons) Kordahl of Alexandria, VA, parents of Berit and Jackson; his grandma Charlotte (Raymond) Rantala of Duluth, MN; Susan (Doug) Nelson of The Villages, FL parents of Catherine and Julia; Kathy (Scott) Reinhard of Park Falls, WI; Jean (Kelly) Hare of Gilbert, AZ parents of Andrea and Allison; Amy Rantala (Tom Savaloja) of Eau Claire, WI parents of Max, Jack and Will. Alex is preceded in death by his grandparents Axel and Catherine Kordahl, Gloria Kaste, Dale Ridgely, grandpa Raymond Rantala, Scott Reinhard, and Ann Rantala.
