  "text": "The gentle splash of flippers signalled a new chapter for five green turtles that were released back into the wild in Rangaunu Harbour in the Far North.\nThe release marks the beginning of an important three-year research project, as two of the turtles have been satellite tagged as part of a groundbreaking research project to protect these taonga of the ocean.\nThe study is part of a collaborative effort led by the Department of Conservation (DoC) in partnership with iwi, and with support from Auckland Zoo and Sea Life Kelly Tarlton’s Aquarium. The aim is to tag up to 20 turtles over the next three years.\nIt is the beginning of the largest satellite tagging study undertaken for green turtles in New Zealand and will inform experts about where the turtles go and when.\nDoC marine senior science adviser Dr Karen Middlemiss, who is leading the research, was grateful to be working alongside iwi.",
