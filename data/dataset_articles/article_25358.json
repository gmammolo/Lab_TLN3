EVs priced above 40,000 pounds will incur a 2,125-pound \"expensive car supplement.\"\nAnalysts note that the synergy between infrastructure investment and EV affordability is accelerating Britain's shift to zero-emission transport. Yet, reconciling tax policies with consumer incentives remains critical to sustaining growth.\n\"Long term, we need measures that incentivize private purchases and facilitate a faster rollout of charging infrastructure,\" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
