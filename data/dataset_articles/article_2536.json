  "text": "Trial begins for man accused of leaving child to drown in motel bathtub\nA man accused of leaving a 1-year-old girl to drown in a bathtub in Manchester more than five years ago is now on trial.\nIn opening statements Wednesday, prosecutors said Zachary Conway was careless and high on drugs when the child drowned.\nConway's attorneys said there's no denying that the girl's death was tragic, but they said it was an accident. Defense attorneys said Conway was not under the influence of drugs when the child drowned, but he was sick and being treated for pneumonia.\n\"We're not going to be able to say this wasn't tragic,\" said defense attorney Mark Sisti. \"But you know what we can say? It wasn't criminal.\"\n>> Download the free WMUR app to get updates on the go: Apple | Google Play <<\nProsecutors said Conway was under the influence of marijuana when he put the child he was caring for that night in a bathtub at an Econo Lodge in Manchester. They said he fell asleep while she was in the tub, and he found her there, dead, after he woke up.\n\"The defendant's conduct was far and away from what a reasonable person would have done in the same situation,\" said prosecutor Zachary Charland. \"Because the defendant failed to supervise Stella, because of his negligence, she drowned.\"\nThe child's mother and Conway had a relationship at one point, and the jury also heard from her Wednesday. Defense attorneys said she doesn't believe Conway was high when her daughter drowned.\nProsecutors told the jury that they do not have to prove intent in a negligent homicide case, while Conway's attorneys asked the jury to keep their minds open as the trial moves forward.",
