  "text": "California ranks second in the nation for birding. Here's where to birdwatch\nRoseann Cattani\n- California is a top destination for birdwatching due to its diverse geography and abundance of bird species.\n- Over 600 bird species, representing about two-thirds of North American bird species, can be found in California.\n- The state's numerous national wildlife refuges and birding parks make it a haven for bird enthusiasts.\n- Birdwatchers can observe climate-endangered and climate-threatened species, highlighting the impact of global warming on bird populations.\n- Spring migration in California, a prime time for birdwatching, occurs along the Pacific Flyway from March 1 to June 15.\nAs more than a billion birds begin their spring migration across California to their summer breeding grounds in the north, the state's birdwatchers are getting out their binoculars, maps, and other tools of the trade.\nThe Golden State was named the top second destination of all fifty states for birdwatchers by\noutdoor adventure site KÜHL, which evaluated eight criteria: bird migration counts, species totals, endemic and threatened species, and the number of birding wildlife refuges and national parks.\nThe No. 2 state for birdwatching, according to their report, was Texas.\nWhy was California ranked second for birdwatching?\nMore than 600 bird species have been spotted in California, making up about two-thirds of all bird species in North America, according to the\nNational Audubon Society.\nThe state's varied geography, from coastal regions to mountain ranges, provides an ideal habitat for numerous birds, according to KÜHL, and its 43 national wildlife refuges and 16 popular birding parks make it a haven for bird enthusiasts.\nAlso highlighted by the report are notable endemic bird species popular with birdwatchers including Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), found only on Santa Cruz Island, and the Yellow-billed Magpie (Pica nuttalli), which inhabits the Central Valley and adjacent areas.\nMore than 170 out of 314 North American birds identified by the\nNational Audobon Society as either climate threatened or climate endangered are commonly sighted in California.\nClimate-endangered birds, including the\nSpotted Owl, Bald Eagle, and Rofous hummingbird, are at risk of losing more than 50% of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace. Climate threatened birds like the Mountain Quail and Hairy Woodpecker are at risk to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2080.\nTop 5 states for birdwatching in the United States\nThe top 5 states for birdwatching, according to KÜHL:\n- Texas\n- California\n- Florida\n- Minnesota\n- Virginia\nWhere are good spots in California for bird watching during spring migration?\nBirds that migrate over California in the spring fly along the Pacific Flyway, a 5000-mile-long corridorthat extends from Patagonia to Alaska. Spring migration runs from March 1 to June 15.\nCalifornians can monitor the bird migration in real-time with online tool\nBirdCast, which shows the number of birds crossing the state during a period of peak migration and how many birds crossed the night before.\nGood spots to see birds across the state,\nas suggested by Audubon California, are:\n- Point Loma, San Diego\n- Sacramento NWR\n- Pt. Reyes, Marin County\n- Butterbredt Springs, Kern County\n- Piedras Blancas, Central Coast\n- Morro Bay\n- Angeles Crest Forest, Los Angeles\n- Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area\n- Owens Lake, Eastern Sierra\n- Mono Lake, Eastern Sierra\n- Humboldt Bay\n- Elkhorn Slough, Monterey\n- Salton Sea, Imperial County\n- Lower LA River (Willow Street)\n- Bolsa Chica Wetlands, Orange County/Los Angeles\nHow to get started birdwatching\nBirdwatching has become incredibly popular in the United States. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 96 million people (or 3 out of 10 Americans) engaged in birding, making up 37% of the population aged 16 and older.\nTo get started as a birdwatcher, the\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and KÜHL offer these helpful tips:\n- Get your equipment: Binoculars, field guide, comfortable shoes, camera, journal for observations\n- Choose your destination: Resources like\neBirdprovide real-time bird sightings and hotspot maps to help you find the best locations.\n- Use Birding Apps and Websites: Apps like\nMerlin Bird IDfor identifying species in the field and Audubon Bird Guidefor in-depth bird profiles.\n- Bird identification: Note the following—size, color (breast, wing), shape, behavior, habitat, markings, song.\n- Join a Birding Community: Connect with local birding groups on websites like\nBirding Palto help you find experienced birders to accompany you on trips.\n- Respect Nature and Follow Ethical Birding Practices: Stick to designated trails, maintain a safe distance from birds, and avoid disturbing nesting areas.\nThe American Birding Association’s Code of Ethics\n- Go on a field trip: To your local park, your backyard, public lands, or to one of the state's birding hotspots listed above.",
