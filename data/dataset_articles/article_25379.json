  "text": "MANKATO — A permit application to mine sand and gravel on land immediately adjacent to one of the Mankato area's newest and largest parks has been withdrawn following a flood of opposition.\n\"Victory! Red Jacket Valley Park Saved!\" was the announcement on the site of an online petition aiming to halt the gravel mine proposed by Samuel Borneke of Madison Lake.\n\"All the public opposition to the plans for mining the forest next to Red Jacket Valley Park proved too much for the developer and he withdrew his application ... . We couldn't have saved this forest without the support of all you.\"\nThe petition claimed more than 2,500 supporters by Wednesday with 60% from ZIP codes associated with Mankato, North Mankato and St. Peter.\nThe response in an indication of how much affection has been generated by the park less than a decade after it came into existence as a joint project of the city of Mankato and Blue Earth County. Several of the petition-signers shared glowing reviews of the park in explaining why they opposed the gravel mine.\n\"When I show off my home to visitors, this is where I take them,\" a Mankato woman wrote. \"Don't deface a masterpiece.\"\n\"Red Jacket Trail and Park is one of my favorite places to bring my dogs to explore and enjoy the outdoors,\" a North Mankato man added. \"It would be a great shame to lose the wildlife and the peace and tranquility of walking around the lake and the trails. I hope wisdom and the needs of the greater community prevail and that this project is put on hold at least until an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution is found.\"\n\"My family has enjoyed the beauty there for many years,\" another man wrote. \"There's nothing beautiful about mining.\"\nThe petition's description of the controversy contrasts the park \"with its wooded landscapes, peaceful waters, and diverse array of fauna\" and what opponents fear will be on the adjacent land if the gravel pit is permitted — \"hazardous cesspools scattered amongst the equipment and fuel tanks.\"\n\"Our job is to safeguard this sanctuary from the jaws of such irreparable damage,\" the petition states.\nBut there's a bit of irony surrounding the comments because the now-beloved park was itself a gravel mine for more than half a century, still operating as recently as a dozen years ago, and may never have become public property except for mining.\nWhat was later named Red Jacket Valley County Park, a nod to the nearby Red Jacket Trail, had previously been known as Guaranteed Gravel and Sand. The nearly 40-acre pond at the center of the park that offers a swimming beach and kayaking opportunities was carved out by decades of gravel extraction.\nAdjoining land brought the total size of the property to more than 150 acres of ponds, woods and shoreland beside the Le Sueur River. Because of the scenery, the water features and the site's proximity to Mankato — barely two miles from the city's downtown — there had been hope for many years that it would eventually become a natural and recreational resource for the public.\nIt was 10 years ago that the idea began to look more realistic.\nAl Forsberg, who was then the county Public Works director, told The Free Press in May 2015 that it appeared the site no longer had gravel and sand resources that could be economically extracted. Southern Minnesota Construction officials seemed open to at least exploring the option of a donation or low-cost sale of the land — something that offered potential tax benefits, as well as public relations value.\n\"It does seem to have a little meat to it at this point,\" Forsberg said.\nBy June of that year, executives at Old Castle Materials Inc., an Atlanta-based corporation that had purchased Southern Minnesota Construction, expressed interest in selling that parcel and another depleted gravel pit known as the Sanger pit for use as parkland. Just a year later, a $225,000 price had been negotiated and the deal was done.\nConnected by public land along the river, the two parcels became the county-owned Red Jacket Valley Park and the smaller city-owned Mni Wašté Park.\nNot surprisingly, sand and gravel deposits don't end at the park's boundaries, and Borneke proposed mining the material under more than a quarter of the 9-acre parcel he purchased between the county park and County Road 1. Details of his plans were sent to nearby property owners on Feb. 28 by Victoria Potts, who works out of Mankato's Community Development Department, which contracts with Mankato Township to administer planning and zoning applications.\n\"The applicant is proposing to utilize approximately 2.5 acres of the 8.96-acre parcel to mine and will not be using explosives, but will utilize machinery to extract sand from the mined area,\" Potts wrote. \"Plans are included that document the depths of the mining operation. Operations of the business will take place 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday and will be dependent on orders received for the sand. There will be no more than four employees on-site.\"\nBack-to-back public hearings were scheduled for March 19 before the Mankato Township Planning Commission and the Township Board. The intense opposition followed, and Mankato Community Development Director Mark Konz verified Wednesday afternoon that the application has been withdrawn.\nThe Free Press sought comment from Borneke by phone and email, asking whether he was reworking the proposal, planning to do outreach to address the concerns of opponents or completely abandoning the mining project. He was also asked if he had reclamation plans for the site once the sand and gravel was depleted.\nBorneke had not responded as of early evening.",
