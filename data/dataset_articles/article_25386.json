  "text": "Electric vehicle (EV) sales have increased by 20% across Europe so far this year, according to new data from Rho Motion.\nThe EV research house looked at wider global trends for EV sales, which saw markets like China increase EV sales by 35%, while markets like the US and Canada saw a similar 20% increase to Europe.\nBattery Eeectric vehicles (BEVs) have taken the lion’s share of this growth at 29% year-to-date, with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) modestly growing at 2%.\nMost European markets are up YTD, with the exception of France which remains down due to the introduction of a weight tax on PHEVs which began in January 2025 which has led to a decrease in PHEVs by 48% YTD.\nHowever, BEV sales in France are now up by 1% YTD.\nThe German and UK BEV market continues strong sales with both over 40% YTD.\nThe EU Commission has proposed flexibility for car and van manufacturers meeting CO2 standards.\nThe flexibility would allow these manufacturers to meet these targets by averaging performance over three years, helping prevent large fines that several car manufacturers were expected to face.\nCharles Lester, Rho Motion data manager, said: “It’s been a solid start to the year for EV sales globally with a 50% bump in February compared to the previous year.\n“Much of the growth continues to come from China which is seeing a pure electric renaissance this year compared to the hybrid love affair of 2024.\n“France’s weight tax on plug-in hybrids has had a big impact on those vehicle sales which are down almost 50% so far this year.\n“Manufacturers might be relieved that the EU has introduced flexibility into the emissions standards, but they will still need to put their foot to the pedal to avoid large fines.\n“As for North America, the region is seeing steady growth of 20% so far this year.\n\"American drivers bought 30% more electric vehicles than they had by this time last year, making use of the final months of IRA tax breaks before the incentives are expected to be pulled later this year.”",
