  "text": "South Korea- /\nPersonal Products- /\n- KOSDAQ:A123330\nRisks Still Elevated At These Prices As Genic Co., Ltd. (KOSDAQ:123330) Shares Dive 25%\nTo the annoyance of some shareholders, Genic Co., Ltd. (KOSDAQ:123330) shares are down a considerable 25% in the last month, which continues a horrid run for the company. Nonetheless, the last 30 days have barely left a scratch on the stock's annual performance, which is up a whopping 410%.\nEven after such a large drop in price, you could still be forgiven for thinking Genic is a stock not worth researching with a price-to-sales ratios (or \"P/S\") of 2.8x, considering almost half the companies in Korea's Personal Products industry have P/S ratios below 0.9x. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/S at face value as there may be an explanation why it's as high as it is.\nAI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early.\n View our latest analysis for Genic\nWhat Does Genic's Recent Performance Look Like?\nWith revenue growth that's exceedingly strong of late, Genic has been doing very well. The P/S ratio is probably high because investors think this strong revenue growth will be enough to outperform the broader industry in the near future. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\nWant the full picture on earnings, revenue and cash flow for the company? Then ourfree report on Genicwill help you shine a light on its historical performance.\nDo Revenue Forecasts Match The High P/S Ratio?\nGenic's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver solid growth, and importantly, perform better than the industry.\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 78% gain to the company's top line. The latest three year period has also seen a 30% overall rise in revenue, aided extensively by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably been satisfied with the medium-term rates of revenue growth.\nComparing that to the industry, which is predicted to deliver 13% growth in the next 12 months, the company's momentum is weaker, based on recent medium-term annualised revenue results.\nWith this in mind, we find it worrying that Genic's P/S exceeds that of its industry peers. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited recent growth rates and are hoping for a turnaround in the company's business prospects. Only the boldest would assume these prices are sustainable as a continuation of recent revenue trends is likely to weigh heavily on the share price eventually.\nThe Final Word\nThere's still some elevation in Genic's P/S, even if the same can't be said for its share price recently. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-sales ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.\nThe fact that Genic currently trades on a higher P/S relative to the industry is an oddity, since its recent three-year growth is lower than the wider industry forecast. Right now we aren't comfortable with the high P/S as this revenue performance isn't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. If recent medium-term revenue trends continue, it will place shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.\nYou need to take note of risks, for example - Genic has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about.\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.
