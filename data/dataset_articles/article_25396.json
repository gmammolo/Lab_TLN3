(Credit: New England Aquarium)\nLiving longer than expected\nThe backstory:\nAfrican penguins typically live between 10 and 15 years in the wild, according to the aquarium.\nMore than half of the penguins that are in the aquarium’s care are living far longer than that.\nTo accommodate their aging penguins, the aquarium created a separate island from the main penguin colony that would provide the animal care team with a bird’s eye view to easily monitor the animals.\n\"Careful records are kept on each penguin’s behavior, feedings, and more so that staff can quickly spot changes that might be indicative of ailments that afflict older penguins, such as foot injuries and cataracts,\" according to an aquarium news release.\nMeet the geriatric penguins\nAquarium staff transitioned six penguins to their new island home over the past month.\n- Harlequin: 32 years old\n- Durban: 32 years old\n- Boulders: 34 years old\n- Isis: 29 years old\n- Lambert: 32 years old\n- Dyer: 14 years old\nWhat they're saying:\n\"We think of this island like assisted living, where we’re helping the birds be more comfortable in a calmer environment,\" said Diana Major, Manager of Penguins.\nAbout African penguins\nDig deeper:\nAfrican penguins are a critically endangered species, according to the aquarium.\nThe main threats plaguing these animals are climate change, habitat loss and pollution.\nThe species typically lives on the coasts of South Africa and Namibia.\nThese penguins, like many others, enjoy eating small fish such as anchovies, sardines and horse mackerel.\nThey can grow to be between 23 and 25 inches tall and can weigh five to nine pounds.\nThe Source: Information for this article was gathered from The New England Aquarium in Boston and Storyful.
