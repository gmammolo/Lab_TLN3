  "text": "TROUTDALE, Ore. (KOIN) — At the western edge of the Columbia River Gorge, magnificent conifers grow. Specifically sugar pines, whose “name refers to the sweet, resinous sap it exudes from bark wounds,” according to the Oregon Encyclopedia. “Sugar pine is the king of the conifers,” said Ryan Domingo, who owns the Sugarpine Drive-In in Troutdale with his wife Emily Cafazzo. “When we’re out here living and working in the Gorge, we’re surrounded by all these beautiful trees. Before we opened Sugarpine, we had a catering company called Larch Provisions, and we just wanted to keep it in the conifer family.” There is another reason they named it Sugarpine. “Being an ice cream shop, sugar pine trees have the largest pine cones. We’re doing ice cream cones, so we thought it was fitting,” he said. “The name just kind of feels joyful, playful and kind of a nod to the sweet items on our menu as well.” They opened Sugarpine — located at Mile Marker 0 on the Historic Columbia River Highway — in 2018 after spending years in top restaurants in New York and Portland. “I’m a native Oregonian,” Cafazzo said, “and Ryan went to school here at U-P. But we didn’t meet until we were in our late 20s in New York City and we both lived and worked out there. But we just love Oregon so much that we wanted to move back home. And that was 12 years ago.” Domingo said when they moved, the moved to the Columbia River Gorge, “our favorite place to recreate. We just kept thinking, ‘What could we do to use our food experience, a restaurant experience, to add value to the community?'” That’s why their mission with the Sugarpine Drive-In is to create a gathering space and offer healthy food options. “We’re really honored that so many people love Sugarpine,” Cafazzo said. “We’ve become a real destination out here in the Gorge, providing freshness and nostalgia all wrapped together in a delicious package.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KOIN.com.",
