  "text": "SPOKANE, Wash. – The Dishman Hills Conservancy (DHC) has acquired a key piece of land that connects the Dishman Hills Natural Area to the Glenrose Unit, furthering efforts to protect and expand Spokane’s natural landscapes.\nAccording to a press release, the newly secured Keystone Connection Property provides a continuous corridor from the northern portions of Dishman Hills to the Stevens Creek trailhead. According to the Conservancy, the acquisition was made possible through donations from two couples, Bruno and Valaurie Caprez and Bill and Nadean Meyer.\n“This is a critical artery for the Wild Heart of Spokane,” said Suzy Dix, a Dishman Hills Conservancy board member. “I am so thrilled and ecstatic to celebrate one of the biggest connections for the Dishman Hills Conservancy. This parcel of land, which connects the north portions to the middle portion, actually completes the connection between the north and all the way to the trailhead at Stevens Creek Road—with just a little trek along public roads!”\nDHC Executive Director Ruth Gifford said the purchase will improve public access, protect wildlife corridors and support ecological conservation.\nDetails of the acquisition will be discussed at the organization’s annual meeting on March 18. Until the transition is complete, the public is asked to respect private property boundaries.",
