  "text": "The couple’s work requires round-the-clock care, with significant energy demands for heating, food storage, and essential medical equipment. Spiralling energy costs were putting the future of their foster care at risk, so to ease this burden, GoodWe and Six Star Plus have donated and installed a solar energy system at their property, ensuring a reliable and sustainable energy source to support the care of the animals.\nWhen GoodWe heard about Colin and Jill’s urgent need for a sustainable energy solution, GoodWe contacted local solar retailer Six Star Plus, who were eager to step in. To meet their energy needs, an 8.4 kW solar system was installed, featuring 20 REC solar panels generously donated by AWM Greentech Clayton and a GoodWe 8 kW MS G3 inverter. This system significantly reduces energy costs while providing a stable and sustainable power supply for essential equipment such as heating lamps, refrigeration, and medical devices required for the animals’ care.\nDean Williamson, Country Manager at GoodWe Australia, highlighted the company’s commitment to corporate social responsibility:\n“Helping worthy and non-profit causes is something we’re really passionate about at GoodWe. When we heard about Colin and Jill’s situation, we saw an incredible opportunity to make a real difference. Wildlife carers do vital work, often behind the scenes and usually receive no government funding, and having access to solar energy will ease their financial strain while supporting conservation efforts.”\nLauren from Six Star Plus expressed her admiration for Colin and Jill’s dedication: “Colin and Jill have committed decades of their lives, caring for these animals around the clock. We wanted to support them in a way that has a lasting impact. The Six Star Plus team do a lot of voluntary work around Victoria every year, along with fundraising projects and donated systems. Last year we were proud to be given the GoodWe ‘GoodWill’ Award, so we were delighted to work with GoodWe on this project. AWM Greentech Clayton were also fantastic supporters in donating the solar panels needed. We hope Colin and Jill can now continue their incredible work, without the stress of high energy bills.”\nColin and Jill expressed their gratitude for the support and highlighted how others can help: “We care for these animals 24/7, and our energy use is huge. The solar system is a game-changer — it means lower costs and more resources for the joeys. We also rely on things like formula, tissues, and wet wipes, so any support is always appreciated. Our goal is to raise these young ones, move them to a larger shelter as they grow, and eventually see them released back into the wild.”\nThis initiative highlights GoodWe’s commitment to using solar technology for positive environmental and community impact. By powering a wildlife rescue with renewable energy, GoodWe and Six Star Plus are not only reducing carbon footprints but also directly contributing to wildlife conservation in Australia.",
