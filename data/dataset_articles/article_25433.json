  "text": "Renovations to China Beach will kick off this spring after a three-year wait. Why it matters: The $20 million project, which will upgrade restrooms , picnic areas and the retaining wall that protects the beach, was originally supposed to finish in 2025, according to the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon . Catch up quick: China Beach, tucked into the Sea Cliff neighborhood, is a local favorite for swimming, sunbathing and play. The project was set to break ground in October 2022 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA), which was established in 1972. Reality check: The project was delayed in part because the contract was administered by separate federal agencies, Claire Mooney, vice president for park projects and conservation at the conservancy, told the San Francisco Chronicle . The big picture: China Beach is said to have served as a campground for Chinese fishermen in the 1800s after the Foreign Miners Tax forced Chinese people to leave the goldfields and join fishing crews to make a living. Yes, but: Phelan was a proponent of anti-Asian policies , including the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.",
