  "text": "\"This surfboard continues that shared history and reinforces our commitment to making the circular economy a reality.\"\nACCIONA and DDB Melbourne have launched the first product from ‘Turbine Made’, an initiative that transforms retired turbine blades from landfill by turning them into new materials and products.\nA ‘Turbine Made’ surfboard, co-designed and developed in collaboration with renowned Australian pro surfer Josh Kerr and his team at Draft Surf, was unveiled on Seven Network’s Sunrise and has already gained cultural traction.\nACCIONA took the retired fibreglass turbine blade and transformed it into the ‘Turbine Made’ particulate to create the surfboard. The team at Draft Surf then used bespoke processing techniques to integrate the particulate into a range of beautifully crafted, high performance surfboards.\nDDB Group Melbourne ECD Giles Watson, said surfers have an unbreakable bond with the environment.\n\"Creating a board from recycled turbine blades helps inspire the next generation of environmentalists,\" Watson said.\n\"Beyond being bloody cool, this project proves that sustainability and performance can go hand in hand—opening the door for a wave of new possibilities with Turbine Made.\"\nACCIONA general manager, brand and marketing, Caroline Pinter said the company has been connected to the surfing community for a long time.\n\"At our first wind farm in Navarra, Spain, local surfboard shapers helped repair turbine blades because of their expertise in fiberglass,\" Pinter said.\n\"This surfboard continues that shared history and reinforces our commitment to making the circular economy a reality.\"\nACCIONA’s Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm provided the perfect backdrop for the first test flight of the ‘Whatever Surfboard’.\nKerr said the board is both durable and lightweight.\n\"The conditions at Cathedral Rocks pushed the surfboards to their limits and they held up beautifully and performed great,\" Kerr said.\n\"The Turbine Made particulate is extremely durable and lightweight, making it ideal to use in our performance surfboards.\"\nThe surfboard is just the beginning of an ongoing initiative that will see hundreds of businesses and individuals make their products more sustainable by using the recycled wind turbine material.\nMedia, influencers and the public were able to try the ‘Turbine Made’ surfboard in action for themselves at an event held at URBNSURF in Sydney last week and is supported via an integrated campaign and a range of apparel featuring key art created by renowned illustrator Jake Foreman.\nCredits:\nClient: ACCIONA Energía\nAgency: DDB Group Melbourne\nPR: Mango Communications\nIllustrator: Jake Foreman (Jacky Winter)\nProduction: DDB's Maker Studios & Eyre films\nPhotographer: Hayden Richards\nSound: Bang Bang",
