  "text": "Major Barren County solar project forges ahead\nBARREN COUNTY, Ky. (WBKO) - North Carolina solar energy company Geenex is forging ahead with a major solar farm project in Barren County.\nHow did the project come to be?\nIn 2019, Geenex came to Glasgow asking for approval for this Wood Duck Solar project.\nPlanning & Zoning Director Kevin Myatt said the state’s Public Service Commission Office and the Department of Energy regulate and authorize solar projects like Geenex’s. Solar energy companies like to get local approval to show the state they have done their due diligence adhering to those rules.\nDue to the city being the only one with zoning ordinances, as long as any company with a plan meets the minimum rules for development, they’re approved.\nMyatt said in addition to Geenex going door-to-door when they first introduced the project, the city has held public hearings and meetings about solar farms and alternative energy since 2018. Despite this, several residents around the affected area feel unheard and uninformed.\n“I can certainly sympathize with maybe some of the angst that’s there. Without having zoning in our county, we cannot dictate any use that takes place,” Myatt said. “So hopefully this spurs some discussion with regards to having countywide zoning because in truth, there is no way to stop any kind of development, or even have a say on it, without having county-wide zoning.”\nWhat is the Wood Duck Solar Project?\nGeenex would maintain and protect the 2,300 acres of leased land until they decide to leave. They currently propose putting solar panels on about 1,100 acres of that land.\nThe lease agreements are private contracts between Geenex and landowners. According to their website, these projects can last up to 40 years. Once done, the land goes back to the owner’s control.\nGeenex expects to deliver enough electricity to power the equivalent of 17,000 homes annually depending on the power grid needs. However, those needs may not be locally, so the company can sell this energy in other places.\nBarren County officials say they are making the best of the situation without a county land ordinance, explaining that the community benefits from the tax revenue and donations the company brings in.\n“They even came to me like, ‘How can we get involved in the community?’” Barren County Judge/Executive Jamie Byrd said. “They’ve joined the Chamber of Commerce, they’ve sponsored some events, they did make a donation to Beautify Barren County.”\nAccording to Geenex, the local jurisdiction would receive about $15 million, $11 million of which would go towards the county school system.\nReaction from nearby and affected landowners\nWhile Geenex moves ahead for further approval, community discussion on the project continues.\nOne landowner, Dr. Troy Robertson, would be directly affected by the solar farm. He’s thankful that the development coming in is Geenex.\n“They’re taking good care of us. This is not eminent domain, this is not some fearful terrible power company coming in to take our property,” he said. “This is actually a really good neighbor moving in, and they have an opportunity to generate income, and they’re sharing that opportunity with us.”\nHe even traveled to North Carolina for an event Geenex was holding, where he and his family learned more about their work. Robertson said he trusts that Geenex will honor their land and will further benefit the community.\nHe and Myatt said that people may see some panels when there isn’t as much growth on the trees but they won’t be a disruption.\nHowever WBKO spoke to some residents who weren’t happy with the thought of looking out their window and potentially seeing solar panels instead of woodlands or grassy fields.\nPaula Pedigo, a resident owner near the affected land, said she’s spoken to people concerned with things like the potential health and fire risks, water contamination, property devaluation and the loss of land that, if not used for farming, might displace wildlife.\n“We like our views, we like our land, we like our lakes and we like our ponds and our cattle and our hills and our crops. That’s what Barren County is known for,” she said. “This project’s destroying that, massively.”\nWhile she supports the personal use of solar energy, she believes this mass project is not fit for Barren County’s residential areas.\nAnother landowner next to the proposed affected land said she’s been upset since Geenex knocked on her door. She’s especially worried that the many animals she sees on her property will leave if solar farms are built around the area.\n“I came here for peace and quiet, nature. I’m a nature lover, the land talks to my heart,” Nancy West said. “I’ve been a farmer the majority of my life and this is breaking my heart.”\nAlthough she had one panel on her ranch back in California and loved it, she doesn’t agree with the Wood Duck solar project’s size and believes the project is “pitting neighbors against neighbors, friends against friends.”\nWhat’s next?\nThe project is still pending approval, with Geenex trying to arrange a public hearing with the Public Service Commission.\nCopyright 2025 WBKO.
