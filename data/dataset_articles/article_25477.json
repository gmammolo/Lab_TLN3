  "text": "A golden eagle (Aquila chysaetos) was recently spotted soaring over the Kankakee Sands prairie, to which we say, “That’s Golden!”\nIt’s awesome news because it reaffirms everything that we want Kankakee Sands to be – a home for those species who spend their whole lives here on the prairies and savannas, as well as a seasonal home for those species — like the golden eagle — who might overwinter in Indiana rather than in the frozen tundra to the north.\nOver the last 10-20 years, golden eagles have been seen on occasion in Newton County. It’s a very memorable experience to see a large golden eagle — it stands 2.5 feet tall and has a wing span of nearly 6.5 feet!\nThough golden eagles are a large bird, they are notorious for begin fast and agile in flight. They have been clocked at nearly 200 miles per hour!\nFor such a large, fast, nimble creature, it has a sweet call that sounds to me like I imagine a seagull in love might sound. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Golden_Eagle/sounds\nWhile exciting, it can also be a little confusing. Due to their size, they are often confused from afar with bald eagles and turkey vultures. And so identifying the golden eagle requires an eagle eye for detail.\nThe golden eagle is named for the golden feathers at the nape of its neck which look radiant in the correct light. However, on overcast days, those same identifying feathers can look tawny brown and rather lackluster.\nSo, look instead for its large, hooked beak. This beak is used for eating small mammals such as rabbits and ground squirrels.\nAnd don’t let their plumage fool you. Like many birds, golden eagles have plumage variations depending on age. Juvenile golden eagles will have white wing patches and a white tail band when viewed from below. Older golden eagles lack the white feathers and have darker plumage covering their entire body.\nThat’s the amazing thing about nature: we can experience that feeling of awe and admiration, and also be challenged to learn more about everything we’re seeing and hearing. Asking questions is how we learn!\nGolden eagles can be found all across the northern hemisphere of the globe in areas of large open grassland habitat. Here in North American, golden eagles inhabit Alaska, Canada, northern Mexico and much of the United States, including right here at Kankakee Sands in Newton County, Indiana!\nAs winter draws to a close, stop by Kankakee Sands to try to spot a golden eagle before they return to their summer breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska. If you catch sight of one, consider yourself extremely fortunate and enjoy the priceless view!\nFor more information on this gorgeous, iconic, national bird of Albania, Austria, Germany, Kazakhstan, and Mexico and winter-time visitor to Kankakee Sands, check out the US Fish and Wildlife Service webpage on Golden Eagles https://www.fws.gov/species/golden-eagle-aquila-chrysaetos.\nThe Nature Conservancy’s Kankakee Sands is an 8,400-acre prairie and savanna habitat in Northwest Indiana, open every day of the year for public enjoyment. It’s an exciting year for Kankakee Sands, as we are making major improvements to popular areas within the preserve.\nIf you plan to visit, please check our Facebook page to see if any of the areas you want to see will be impacted by the construction.\nFor more information about Kankakee Sands, visit www.nature.org/KankakeeSands or call the office at 219-285-2184.",
