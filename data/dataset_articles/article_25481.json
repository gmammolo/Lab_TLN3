This funding gives prospective organizations and small landowners support to implement regenerative practices such as agroforestry, native reforestation and soil health improvements. Grantees can also employ practices that reduce carbon emissions and promote carbon sequestration and storage. Eligible entities include private landowners and lessees, or those with documented access and rights to land management, community organizations, hui, networks and hubs, schools and businesses.\n“This is an opportunity to expand on the positive impacts that landowners and stewards have already created,” said Leah Laramee, Climate Commission Coordinator. “The more support we can provide around practical solutions to climate-related events, the better the outcomes for lands across the state.”\nThe previous cycle awarded funding to 10 grantees from Hawaiʻi County, Molokaʻi and Oʻahu, including organizations engaged in restoring native forests, improving soil health through composting, and transitioning fallow land to agroforestry systems. With this new round of funding, the program seeks to broaden its impact and involve an even more diverse range of participants.\nInterested landowners and organizations are encouraged to apply by visiting https://hands.ehawaii.gov/hands/opportunities/opportunity-details/25400. The deadline to apply is April 1, 2025.\n# # #\nRESOURCES\n(All images/video courtesy: DLNR)\nPhotographs – Soil sampling and native planting (September 2024 and February 2025): https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/6ku9c7djjfwgvyej189v2/AATGtERw8iLQfc4_NCDMGDc?rlkey=gxw0kj1qbyo94yymdpth5a6iq&st=on2uven8&dl=0\nFor more information, contact Emilie Perry, at: [[email protected]](https://governor.hawaii.gov/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e2b030702070b403e0b1c1c17402d01001a1c0f0d1a011c2e060f190f070740090118).\nMedia Contact:\nRyan Aguilar\nCommunications Specialist\nHawaiʻi Dept. of Land and Natural Resources\n808-587-0396",
