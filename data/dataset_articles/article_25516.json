  "text": "New lodge to be built at Cheaha State Park\n>>Weather forecast is above\nCheaha State Park will have a new attraction for visitors.\nThe State Parks Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) announced one of its most anticipated projects in years, a new lodge at Cheaha State Park atop Cheaha Mountain.\nAccording to a news release, the new lodge will have three hotel towers of 32 guest units with private balconies.\nThe lodge project will also include a rooftop bar and meeting space.\n\"Our State Parks System has made massive strides in recent years on its way to being one of the best in the nation. With this project, we are adding another world-class facility to our growing list of exceptional overnight accommodations and amenities. We look forward to welcoming lodge guests in early 2026,\" said ADCNR Commissioner Chris Blankenship.\nThe new hotel units will be connected to the existing Vista Event Center (previously the park's restaurant) which will serve as the lodge's lobby, said the news release.\nFunding for the Cheaha project was provided through the $85 million bond measure approved by voters in 2022, said ADCNR.\nThe latest: Entertainment coverage from WVTM 13",
