  "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio ( WCMH ) — Wednesday’s warm, spring-like weather gave people a chance in central Ohio to get outside. This included Green Columbus, which got a chance to plant some trees at West High School in the city’s Hilltop section. According to the organization, adding trees to a community can improve the health of those who live there. Students got the chance to get their hands dirty. “It’s really fun when you get to think about it because, like, only like, sometimes people think about it and be like, ‘It’s boring doing something like this,’ but then again, you get to come around and explore the environment later and think about it and you get to tell even some of your kids that you walk around here, around this beautiful school just building stuff,” student Ray Crump said. In total, 26 trees were planted on Wednesday. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to NBC4 WCMH-TV.",
