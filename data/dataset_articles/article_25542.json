  "text": "PATAGONIA, Ariz. (KVOA) - It's the largest private investment ever made in Southern Arizona and is getting closer to being fully operational.\nThe Hermosa Mine in the Patagonia Mountains, owned by Australian company South32, is starting to hire more and more workers as it prepares to be fully operational in 2027.\nThe mine will produce two minerals South32 considers critical for U.S. interests, Zinc and Manganese.\nCurrently those two minerals, used to create batteries, are mostly produced in China.\nHermosa Mine President Pat Reisner said the production has been fast tracked by the federal government and has been getting interest from the Department of Defense due to how important these materials are.\n“These resources are critical minerals because we’re dependent on foreign nations for our supply that creates risk for our country, that creates national security risk. It’s the only mine development that will produce two critical minerals,\" he said.\nBefore production can happen at full scale there is a lot of testing and construction going on at the site as well as off-site battery testing to make sure the materials are effective for their intended use.\nAll of these efforts have brought in more than 1,000 construction jobs. South32 is constructing a special facility in nearby Nogales that will allow workers with little to no experience the ability to control mining equipment virtually.\nSouth32 will be providing specialized training courses and employing upwards of 900 Santa Cruz County residents.\n“We’ve committed to over 80 percent of our long-term workforce being residents of Santa Cruz County,\" Reisner said.\nIn all South32 said there will be 2,381 direct and indirect jobs created in Santa Cruz County and 3,465 direct and indirect jobs created in Arizona as a result of the project.\nThere will be a labor income of $194 million in the County and $290 million statewide, according to South32.\nThe company said there will be an economic output of $1.16 billion for the County and $1.49 billion for the state.\nSouth32 also estimates there will be local tax revenues of $26 million for the county and $29 million for the state.\nReisner and his team gave News 4 Tucson's Chief Investigative Reporter Chorus Nylander a tour of the mine Wednesday morning.\nThere we could see a large mining shaft that Reisner said will go to depths of 3,000 feet. Using automated machinery they will be able to go even further, below 4,000 feet.\nReisner said the mine is much more compact than open pit mines. Giving a comparison he said the Hermosa mine is slightly larger than Disney Land at 750 acres. That is a tiny fraction of the average space of an Arizona open pit mine which he said goes beyond 10,000 acres.\nReisner said they are also trying to be good stewards of the environment and are going to be using 90 percent less water than mines of similar volume.\nThey are also looking at ways to better protect groundwater levels.\nThat's a big concern for many Santa Cruz County residents like Robin Lucky who leads the Calabasas Alliance, a local group focused on environmental protection.\n“What happens to a place when there’s no groundwater that sounds like a catastrophe to me,\" Lucky said.\nLucky recently got a tour of the mine herself and was happy to see some of the measures they are taking but still questions what the true impact to the areas water levels will be.\nShe said recent studies by the Arizona Department of Water Quality show the area has about 25 years of groundwater left. She worries the mine will use up too much of the precious resource that water is.\nShe is also concerned about air quality and the risk of toxins getting in the air. She said the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, working with Calabasas Alliance, have already started placing air quality sensors across the area.\nShe says they are using two types of monitors. The first is a PurpleAir that residents can view reporting for themselves here and a higher quality device.\n“We think baseline monitoring before extraction starts is incredibly important and we have the support of two major universities.”\nAfter over 35 years in the mining industry, Reisner said he's never been a part of such an environmentally conscious project.\n\"Without a doubt, there’s nothing even close to it.”",
