  "text": "‘Very optimistic,’ crews make progress on more than 37,000-acre Cheyenne River Reservation fire\nRAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA) - Officials are crediting cooler temperatures and calmer winds yesterday with getting a grip on the Route-13 fire.\nAs of Wednesday night, the fire was 50% contained.\n“Going forward the operation continues to put the interior fires out,” Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Chairman Ryman LeBeau said. “They call it mop-up, and there’s some hot spots there that, some draws that have more fuel in it more trees.”\nLeBeau says on Monday, the fire came close to the Takini school and housing.\n“That fire came very close, 50 feet from those houses and so we’re really thankful that all the firefighters were able to curb the fire from the Takini area,” LeBeau added.\nDistrict 5 Council Representative Joseph Brings Plenty says aside from the many firefighters, community members were also involved in the fight.\n“When the main fire was raging by Takini, and that wind was pushing along there, a lot of the fire crews were up there, but some of them were digging fire lines on the north side,” Brings Plenty explained. “Because that fire was still pushing, I think there was one of the community members told me, he was trying to get to a gate, he was driving 45 miles per hour, and he said that the fire actually beat him to the gate.”\nDistrict 4 Representative Thad Rose says efforts to keep the fire today are key as winds are expected tomorrow.\n“I’m pretty optimistic that it’s going to stay at its level of containment,” Rose said.\nGovernor Rhoden sent two national guard Black Hawks to help with the fire.\nOTA AU Films provided footage for the story that aired on KOTA Territory News.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
