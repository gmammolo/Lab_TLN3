  "text": "President Donald Trump has held back nothing in his criticism of Mexican drug cartels, which he has declared to be terror organizations and responsible for the deaths of Americans daily, through their drug and human trafficking.\nBut now there’s a new option being considered to take them on: Drones.\nA report at NBC explains the Trump administration is thinking about targeting the cartels with drone strikes as part of its effort to battle criminal gangs.\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\nThe report said that confirmation came from “six current and former U.S. military, law enforcement and intelligence officials with knowledge of the matter.”\nWhile discussions are at “an early stage,” under consideration are drone strikes against cartel leaders as well as their support networks, a plan that would be aided by the Mexican government, the sources told the network.\nEven covert action, unilateral moves that wouldn’t have the express consent of the Mexican government, has not been ruled out, the report said.\n“If Mexico and the United States proceed together with drone strikes or other action, it would not be the first time they have launched a joint effort to take on the cartels, nor would it be the first time that American military and intelligence worked in concert with Mexico’s law enforcement and army,” NBC reported.\nBut it said what would be unprecedented would be the number of law enforcement officers involved, as well as the use of drones to “bomb cartel personnel and assets.”\nThe report also noted the intelligence gathering about the cartels, by the U.S. military and others, has stepped up dramatically recently.\nOne of the report’s sources said the targets could be cartel operatives, vehicles, warehouses, and any other location that makes up the network for the gangs.\nMexico’s president later asserted she would reject “any form of intervention or interference,” explaining that Mexico will coordinate and collaborate, but not give up its authority.\nPreviously, the network said, Ronald Johnson, the president’s nominee to be ambassador to Mexico, declined to rule out unilateral U.S. action, even in Mexico.\nThe Trump administration’s hope continues to be, the sources reported, that the U.S. will be able to coordinate with Mexico’s military and law enforcement against the cartels.\nThe six sources explained that the fact the U.S. has not ruled out unilateral action could be seen as pressuring Mexico to accept joint operations that it otherwise might have discouraged.\nMexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, already has tried to step up police work against the cartels, including allowing CIA surveillance flights. And she’s sent 10,000 troops to the border where they are searching vehicles for drugs.",
