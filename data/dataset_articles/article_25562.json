Then, they can verify their GHG Protocol Scope 1 and 2 emissions across sectors, including agriculture, waste management, oil and gas, services and industrial. Scope 3 emissions can also be verified on a voluntary basis, encompassing emissions associated with supply chain activities, travel and waste treatmentThe service provides an officially recognised accreditation that can serve as compliance with forthcoming environmental regulations and reporting requirements.\nWelcome to Finextra.
