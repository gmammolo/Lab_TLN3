  "text": "Rs 104-crore investment to secure water supply\n.\nWith the project, BWSSB aims to plug leakage, improve water supply efficiency, and reduce non-revenue water through phased pipeline upgrades\nBangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has initiated a `104 crore project to reduce non-revenue water (NRW) by controlling leakage in aging pipelines. The BWSSB currently supplies water to 10.70 lakh connections across a population of over 1.50 crore in its 18.6.die. jurisdiction. However, pipelines of various diameters, installed nearly 40 to 50 years ago, have suffered significant wear and tear over time, leading to frequent water leakage. This has resulted in both water wastage and financial losses for the board. To address this issue, BWSSB is set to begin the second phase of pipeline replacement across select regions to bring down NRW levels.\nPhased execution to avoid financial burden\nA BWSSB official said, “The estimated cost for replacing old pipelines and rejuvenating water reservoirs is around `8,000 crore. Given the financial implications of executing all works simultaneously, BWSSB has decided to undertake the project in a phased manner.”\nAs per Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organization (CPHEEO) standards, the permissible NRW level should be below 15%. In 2007, Bangalore’s NRW stood at 50.91%, which BWSSB has gradually reduced through various initiatives. After implementing the first phase of the NRW reduction project, the leakage rate was lowered by 2% by 2023. The second phase will now focus on further reducing water loss to meet CPHEEO standards.\nSecond Phase\nThe second phase of work is set to commence in areas such as Halasuru Service Station limits, Johnson Market, Domlur, Machalibetta, Jayamahal, Ramaswamy Palya, and Pulakeshinagar. The key focus of the project includes upgrading old pipeline infrastructure, revamping the water supply network, installing bulk flow meters to accurately measure water distribution, monitoring and replacing faulty water meters, and detecting and regularising unauthorised water connections. These initiatives aim to reduce water wastage, enhance supply efficiency, and ensure accurate billing.\nA BWSSB official added, “Our assessment has identified several major reasons contributing to non-revenue water (NRW) loss. Public pipelines account for around 6% of leakage, while vehicle movement over roads causes cracks in pipelines, leading to an additional 5% loss. Defects in household water connections contribute to 4% of NRW, and faulty water meters are responsible for another 4%. Additionally, leakages in old and dilapidated ground-level reservoirs (GLRs) further add to a 5% loss. Addressing these issues is critical in minimising water wastage and improving overall distribution efficiency.”\nIn 2018, BWSSB launched the first phase of its NRW reduction initiative across Bengaluru South, West, Central, and North divisions, successfully bringing down NRW to 28%. The board is now determined to further lower leakage levels through systematic and incremental interventions. “Replacing old pipelines requires road excavation, making it impossible to complete all works at once. Hence, we will carry out the project in a step-by-step approach. The initiative is expected to significantly improve water conservation and financial efficiency in Bengaluru’s water supply network”, an official added.\nPhased execution to avoid financial burden\nA BWSSB official said, “The estimated cost for replacing old pipelines and rejuvenating water reservoirs is around `8,000 crore.
