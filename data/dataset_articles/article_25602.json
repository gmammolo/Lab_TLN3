  "text": "Lunar Eclipse: The Blood Worm Moon will shine across Alabama\nBlood Worm Moon: A Total Lunar Eclipse returns to Alabama\nBlood Worm Moon: A Total Lunar Eclipse returns to Alabama\nBlood Worm Moon: A Total Lunar Eclipse returns to Alabama\nSet your alarms for 1:30 a.m. Friday morning!\nIf you've ever wanted to see a \"blood moon,\" Friday morning's partial lunar eclipse is your chance. But you'll have to be an early bird, or rather, a very late night owl.\nHere's the lowdown:\nTIMING IS KEY\nIf I were you, I'd set my alarms for 1:30 a.m. Friday morning. That's when the moon will be at its reddest, according to astronomical forecasts.\nThe partial eclipse actually begins earlier, with the moon slowly taking on a reddish tint. But 1:30 a.m. is when the entire moon turns that deep, crimson hue.\nThe red tint will be brightest around 2:00 a.m., before it starts to fade around 2:30 a.m. The moon will return to its normal appearance by about 3:45 a.m.\nSO WHAT'S HAPPENING?\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. You can think of it as the moon having a hard time seeing sunlight.\nBUT WHY RED?\nThis is where it gets interesting. The Earth doesn't completely block all sunlight from reaching the moon; it just blocks most of it.\nHere's the science: The remaining sunlight that does reach the moon has to pass through Earth's atmosphere. As those rays travel through the atmosphere, the nitrogen and oxygen molecules scatter and filter out the blue wavelengths of light. This is the same reason our sky appears blue.\nWhat's left? The longer wavelengths of light, like yellow, orange, and predominantly red, push through the atmosphere and shine onto the moon.\nTHE RESULT: A RED MOON\nIn short, the moon appears red during a lunar eclipse because Earth's atmosphere filters out the blue light from the sun, leaving mostly red light to illuminate the moon.\nSo, if you're up for a late-night celestial show, set those alarms and get ready to witness a stunning red moon. Just remember to grab a blanket and maybe a cup of coffee.\nCLOUDS?\nUnfortunately, for those of us in Alabama, the forecast isn't looking entirely cooperative. We'll be dealing with close to overcast skies by 2:00 a.m., right around the peak of the eclipse. That means that while the \"blood moon\" will be happening, whether or not we'll actually see it is up to mother nature.\nKeep an eye on the latest forecasts as the time gets closer, and if you're really determined, maybe scout out a location with a slightly clearer view, or just hope for a break in the clouds. Even if you can't get a crystal-clear look, knowing that the celestial event is unfolding above the clouds can be a pretty cool experience in itself.",
