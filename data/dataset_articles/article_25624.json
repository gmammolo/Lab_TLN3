  "text": "Thorold’s first battery recycling plant is expanding to allow for more capacity.\nA new multi-chemistry line has been installed in the facility run by EVSX Corp., which announced the expansion Wednesday.\nThe company is partnering with Call2Recycle for battery collection and subsequent drop-off at its processing plant.\nThe battery plant, operational since last July, has been successfully recycling alkaline and carbon zinc batteries.\nThe new line will allow it to process other battery types such as lithium-ion.\n“Our multi-chemistry line has significantly improved Ontario’s capacity as a processor of batteries at the end of their useful life, with 12,500 tonnes of new capacity in one of the most populated hubs in the country for battery collection and processing,” said Ian C. Peres, president and chief executive officer of EVSX, in a news release.\n“We are pleased to work with Call2Recycle to improve the volumes of batteries collected in North America and processed in Ontario.”\nCall2Recycle’s Recycle your Batteries Canada! program highlights ongoing efforts to redirect a wide range of battery types from landfills by ensuring a safe and sustainable method of recovering valuable metals and materials.\n“We are excited to see EVSX expand their operations in Thorold,” said Joe Zenobio, Call2Recycle president and CEO.\n“This expansion marks a significant milestone in our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint and supporting the local economy.”",
