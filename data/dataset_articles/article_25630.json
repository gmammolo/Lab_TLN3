  "text": "Did the sound of truck horns wake you up on Sunday, March 2?\nTwo hundred semi-trucks made their way through Launceston to the Longford Showgrounds for the 42nd Longford Truck Run.\nThe well-loved event attracted 3000 people on Sunday, March 2, to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS).\nIn 2023, the event raised $35,000 for the RFDS - and this year, the team wanted to raise even more.\nCoffee and food vans, a barbecue lunch, face painting, fire trucks and an RFDS simulator were just a few things on offer at the event - and entry was a good coin donation.\nOne of the event organisers, Ros Bonner, said she was passionate about raising money for the RFDS.\n\"You never know when you'll need the RFDS. They have saved lots of lives,\" she said.",
