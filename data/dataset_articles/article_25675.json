It aims to drive the industry's sustained growth and transition toward low-carbon and circular development.\nBy 2027, advanced environmental technologies will see their market share expand significantly, and key industrial chain gaps in core equipment will be addressed, per the guidelines.\nBy 2030, the sector is expected to achieve full self-reliance in technology and solidify China's leadership in global markets, pivoting from traditional pollution control to holistic green and circular solutions.\nThe guidelines map 12 measures across priority areas such as tech innovation, promotion of advanced technologies, cultivation of new growth drivers, and industry ecosystem improvement.\nKey plans include a three-year campaign to upgrade major environmental equipment, and the deeper integration of 5G and artificial intelligence into product design, pollution treatment and environmental monitoring.\nChina's environmental protection equipment industry has expanded steadily, with annual compound growth nearing 6 percent since the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), industry data shows.\nIn 2024, the sector's output hit 920 billion yuan (128.32 billion U.S. dollars).\nAbout People's Daily Online|\nJoin Us|\nContact Us\nCopyright © 2025 People's Daily Online.
