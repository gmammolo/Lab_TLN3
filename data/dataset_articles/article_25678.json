Photo: Polk County Sheriff's Office (2)\nA woman allegedly defecated in a store to distract employees while her alleged male accomplice stole items as part of a bizarre theft , authorities say.\nThe Polk County Sheriff’s Office shared an X post in January, detailing the incident that took place around noon on Dec. 18, 2024 at a Family Dollar store at 2170 Bailey Road in Mulberry, Fla.\nThe suspects, later identified as Tina Joyce and Nikevee Curry, “played different roles as they conspired in their retail theft. Very different roles,” the Jan. 9 post read.\n4 People Accused of Using Bear Costume to Damage Cars in Elaborate Insurance Fraud According to the PCSO, Curry, 36, allegedly stole $500 worth of cleaning products such as “Gain, Tide, and Clorox products” while Joyce, 57, “caused a distraction for employees by using the restroom...without going to the restroom. The floor was her restroom. And an employee had to clean that...stuff up.”\nNikevee Curry. Polk County Sheriff's Office\n“We....kid you not,” the post continued.\nThe PCSO added that the woman left the Family Dollar store in a white Ford van.\n‘Haggler After Midnight,' Who Negotiates What He’ll Steal from Victims, Sought by New York City Police They were dubbed by the department as \"Mr. Clean\" and \"Ms. Dookie.\"\nVideo showed the suspects roaming the store separately, with Curry appearing on surveillance footage pushing a shopping cart full of merchandise. Moments later, Joyce was seen walking in the same direction.\nHashtags included in the Polk County Sheriff’s Office tweet said “ #HeMadeACleanGetaway ,” while noting “ #SheCantReallySayTheSame .”\nTina Joyce.
