  "text": "Police are investigating a string of vandalised water meters in Huntly that almost left the Waikato town without water.\nAccording to a Waikato District Council press release, vandals used a vehicle and chain to rip about 10 water meters out of place in one night.\n“The result of the ripped-out water meters was a large-scale loss of treated drinking water across Huntly.”\nHuntly General ward councillor David Whyte told the Waikato Herald the community came “really close” to running out of water.\n“[If that happens] schools can’t open. People can’t shower before work. You can’t function.”",
