  "text": "Biomass is an abundant renewable resource in Nigeria. Comprising crop and animal residues, manure, charcoal and wood, it accounts for about 80 per cent of Nigeria’s total primary energy consumed. It reduces our reliance on fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal), thereby preventing the release of carbon into the atmosphere, as it has the potential to be carbon neutral. Its immediate addition to Nigeria’s energy mix would aid the country in meeting its 2030 goal of increasing renewable power generation by 45 per cent and reducing greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent.\nThis is why we need more research that will guide our understanding of its material properties and aid energy recovery of our biomass potential. A Nigerian scholar and UK research and innovation fellow, Aminu Owonikoko, undertook a research titled “Characterisation of Biomass Feedstocks Stress Relaxation Properties Using Visco Elastic Models”, which, with his permission, is reproduced in an abridged form in the following paragraphs. The work is his PhD thesis for Mechanical Engineering from The University of Newcastle, Australia.\n“Biomass is a renewable organic material that has the potential to be a significant feedstock for producing renewable energy and other products. Biomass potential as a renewable energy feedstock has not been fully utilised, and the current potential supply of biomass feedstock is dedicated biomass and agricultural residues. These materials form part of what is termed second-generation biomass because they do not compete with food crops.\nTo understand the handling and storage characteristics of the biomass materials, this project assessed the compaction-relaxation of fuzzy cotton seeds, leafy biomass, wheat straw, woodchips, and wood pellets behaviour experimentally and theoretically under various loads concerning time. This knowledge led to a significant step forward in understanding the characterisation of biomass materials. A fundamental and in-depth understanding of the compaction-relaxation response of fuzzy cotton seeds, leafy biomass, wheat straw, woodchip, and wood pellet ensembles has been investigated.\nThese investigations have helped to examine data and optimise visco-elastic models (i.e. stress relaxation models) deeply particularly the Zener model and two Maxwell elements model due to their originality which facilitates a better understanding of the biomass material relaxation mechanics such as fast relaxation and slow relaxation with respect to their respective relaxation time constants (i.e., τ_1 and τ_2).\nThe biomass relaxation characteristics assessed at different times (i.e., at 60, 120, and 180 seconds) using relaxation ratio (RT) and principle (initial) stress (so) have set a pace in understanding the stress relief required for biomass to flow reliably during handling. The results from this work have led to the determination of the stress relief experienced by the material during compaction, which justifies the stress relaxation of biomass materials investigated in this project.\nIn terms of novelty, the project methodology is well-differentiated and adopted visco-elastic models with their parameters (principle/initial stress so, elastic stress – se, decay stresses – s1 and s2, relaxation time constants – τ_1 and τ_2) and interpretations, analysis, and optimised them in a novel way different from what is available in the literature. Numerical and graphical optimisation were used to develop novel _1 and optimised τ_2 for two Maxwell elements model to reduce errors in the relaxation model and maximise curve fitting closeness between measured data and model data in leafy biomass, wheat straw, woodchips, and wood pellets without depending heavily on curve fitting tools (e.g., MATLAB and OriginPro software).\nThe key objectives of this research are to: Achieve through experimental characterisation, the visco-elastic (stress relaxation) properties of several feedstocks: fuzzy cotton seeds, wheat straw, woodchips, leafy biomass, and wood pellets; establish a theoretical framework for a model that covers parameters such as visco-elastic model properties of biomass; optimise visco-elastic model using numerical and graphical techniques with associated error estimation for wheat straw, woodchips, leafy biomass, and wood pellets; Determine visco-elastic model parameters in a novel way without the use of curve fitting tools software because their commonality makes them lack novelty; and compare measured data and predicted data and establish a relationship between them.\nClearly, the research conducted and presented in this thesis serves as an enabler to identify where further work is required for biomass handling based on the experimental investigations carried out, constitutive visco-elastic models (stress relaxation models) assessed, and literature reviewed. The key objectives of the research were completed, especially the mechanical characterisation of biomass materials in comparison with the stress relaxation model. For the holistic completion of the objectives, further work is required.\nAccordingly, the following conclusions plus recommended pathways for using fast relaxation and slow relaxation for materials handling systems and further work recommendations are presented under three sub-titles: mechanical characterisation test, stress relaxation model and prediction, and further work recommendations.\nFor mechanical characterisation tests, it has been established over the years that characterisation techniques that work well for powder or regular shaped materials such as powder flow shear tester cannot be used for biomass materials because of their irregular shape and size properties as well as their stress-phobic nature, especially the materials considered in this project. Significant work has been undertaken on the compaction-relaxation of biomass characteristics, predominantly at lower stresses.\nTherefore, further work needs to be carried out to understand the complexity of biomass ensemble relaxation properties at low-stress levels using novel advanced experimental techniques, such as the MTS Shimadzu AGS-X used in this project. Part of the required further work has been carried out on leafy biomass, wheat straw, woodchips, and wood pellets, which was used to validate the relaxation (visco-elastic) model, particularly the Zener model and two Maxwell elements model.\nFor the stress relaxation model and prediction, the biomass relaxation characteristics assessed at different times and stresses have set a pace in understanding the stress relief required for biomass to flow reliably during handling (i.e., handling of irregular shape particle packing during compaction and relaxation). However, there has been little focus on the lower stress behaviour of biomass, which is reflective of material-handling systems. The results from this work have led to the understanding of the mechanics of materials that account for the flow of biomass materials resistance, which is non-relief stress experienced by the material during compaction, which justifies the stress relaxation of biomass materials investigation.\nFor further work recommendations, the necessity of biomass characterisation can be reflected in the overarching supply chain of biomass materials, especially the compaction and stress relaxation parameters, which often determine the best biomass densification that always reduces initial and last-mile transportation efficiency and costs. More advanced work is required in the techno-economic assessment of biomass handling with an emphasis on stress relaxation tests and analysis to identify and determine stress relief requirements that enable biomass discharge under gravity.\nThe results from this project have led to a deeper understanding of the stress relaxation of biomass materials with respect to time. However, more work is still required in this area. Further work could be investigated by developing a silo discharge characterisation technique coupled with a novel mathematical stress relaxation optimisation model of biomass material packing during flow and mechanical arching.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that little attention is paid to the magnitude of biomass strain, especially during relaxation at low-stress levels. This also requires further work as it will help in further understanding the assessment of the biomass particle mechanics that impact the flow of the particles.\nFurther work is also required in understanding the complexity of biomass ensembles’ dilation properties at low-stress levels with respect to time with a focus on optimisation of three-time constants and other parameters in three Maxwell elements generalised model without the use of curve fitting tools such as MATLAB and OriginPro software.\nFinally, further work will serve as an enabler to validate the visco-elastic model further using numerical and graphical optimisation, especially the accuracy of the model, which is likely to be rooted from relaxation ratio down to error estimation to discriminate among the biomass materials.",
