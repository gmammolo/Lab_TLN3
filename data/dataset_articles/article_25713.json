  "text": "Gov. Shapiro commemorates 300th plugged gas well in statewide DEP effort in Washington County\nGov. Josh Shapiro visited an abandoned gas well site in Washington County Wednesday to commemorate the state’s efforts in plugging its 300th abandoned or orphaned well.\nThis milestone is part of Pennsylvania’s ongoing initiative to improve environmental safety and mitigate public health risks caused by abandoned gas wells, many of which have been left unattended for over a century.\nDuring a press conference at the site near the North Franklin Township municipal building, Governor Shapiro underscored the significance of the project.\n“That lake right over there… a lake that people look at, admire, it's beautiful but can't enjoy because of what's bubbling beneath the surface, literally bubbling beneath the surface, with methane leaking,\" Shapiro said.\nThe lake he was referring to sits next to the site where a local water company's pump station once was. North Franklin Township officials shared an old postcard of the pump station, which dated back to 1911.\nThe governor highlighted the progress made under his administration, proudly noting, “With our 300th well, we have now plugged more wells in the last two years than the Commonwealth plugged in the last 11 years combined.”\nPennsylvania is grappling with over 350,000 orphaned or abandoned wells, a staggering figure noted by Bryan Treese, Operations Director of Penn Mechanical Group. Treese acknowledged the challenge but stressed the importance of continued action.\n“These wells have the potential to contaminate water supplies, degrade ecosystems, or emit methane and air pollutants,” Treese said. “I bet everybody's thinking, ‘Wow, how do we handle that vast number of wells?’ Well, it's simple – one well at a time.”\nMethane, a dangerous and explosive gas, poses significant hazards when poorly managed.\nKurt Klapkowski, Deputy Secretary for the Office of Oil and Gas Management at the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), warned that improperly plugged wells can lead to health and public safety concerns, including methane collection in basements or other subsurface areas.\nFor Pennsylvanians who discover abandoned wells on their property, Klapkowski emphasized the importance of reporting them to the DEP. Trained crews equipped with methane detectors will investigate potential leaks, and necessary steps to cap the wells will follow.\nProperty owners can also report wells by contacting their local DEP office or texting 717-788-8990.\nGovernor Shapiro reiterated the critical nature of these efforts, pointing to the environmental and community benefits.\n“We can enjoy the beauty in our communities,” Shapiro said.\nThe state's well-plugging initiative continues to be a priority in addressing historical challenges while promoting a safer and cleaner Pennsylvania.",
