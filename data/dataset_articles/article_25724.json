(WIFR) - Lisa’s Little Rescue will host the inaugural Animal Rescue Expo from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, March 11 at the UW Sports Factory.\nMore than 100 exhibitors will be at the event covering a variety of topics from adoption, shopping and services, entertainment and education.\nLisa Beardsworth, Lisa’s Little Rescue owner, says whether you are interested in adopting, fostering, volunteering or just love animals, the Animal Rescue Expo is the place to be.\nTickets cost $5 and proceeds benefit the Kibble Korner Pet Food Pantry. Kids under the age of 12 and veterans with a military ID get in for free.\nGuests can also bring a bag of dog or cat food to receive a raffle ticket. Raffle basket winners will be drawn at 4 p.m. Saturday.\nThe St. Patrick’s Day parade will also be in downtown Rockford at the same time as the Animal Rescue Expo. Beardsworth recommends guests go East on Chestnut Street to reach the UW Sports Factory.\nFor more information on the Animal Rescue Expo or Lisa’s Little Rescue, click here.\nCopyright 2025 WIFR.
