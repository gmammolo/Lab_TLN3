  "text": "Chattahoochee river pollution prompts legal action in Phenix City\nPhenix City, Ala. (WTVM) - A state lawsuit has been joined by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper against Phenix City, alleging pollution violations stemming from the city’s Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in 2024, claims that the plant has been in violation of the federal Clean Water Act and the Alabama Water Pollution Control Act. According to the filing, these alleged violations have resulted in untreated or improperly treated waste being discharged into the Chattahoochee River.\nReports from 2023 indicated that foamy discharge, accompanied by a strong odor and sanitary items, was observed near the plant’s outflow pipes. As stated by the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, routine water testing has revealed elevated bacteria levels in the surrounding area.\nPublic records have shown that the facility has been in violation of pollution limits on a regular basis since 2020.\nThe lawsuit is currently ongoing, and further legal proceedings are expected to address the environmental concerns raised by the Riverkeeper and state officials.\nCopyright 2025 WTVM.
