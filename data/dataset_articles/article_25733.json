  "text": "Sandhill crane migration season in full swing\nWOOD RIVER, Neb. (KSNB) - It’s that time of year in Nebraska: Sandhill Crane migration season.\nReferred to as one of the most remarkable wildlife spectacles in North America, the cranes are briefly making the Platte River their home to fuel up for the rest of their journey up north.\n“The Sandhill Crane migration that is happening right now is where all the cranes that have gone south to Mexico and southern U.S. are going north,” said Matt Urbanski, marketing coordinator for the Crane Trust Nature and Visitor Center. “They’re stopping here for two to three weeks, getting fat off of corn, resting up and then flying all the way north to as far as Siberia, Canada and the northern United States.”\nEach crane spends around 29 days along the Platte River, resting and recharging while consuming an estimated 1,600 tons of corn during their stay.\n“What makes the central Platte River valley attractive to Sandhill Cranes is the river that we help manage,” Urbanski said. “We will make sure that there’s not a ton of vegetation choking the river out. We’ll make sure that it can widen, so the sandhill cranes have 6-8 inches of water to sit in during the night time.”\nWhile mid-March is the peak time to see the cranes, some will linger around until mid-April.\nCrane viewing destinations like the Crane Trust and Rowe Sanctuary provide a place for those looking to see the birds. But even outside of crane season, they have activities to offer.\n“Throughout the whole year, people come here to experience bison, go for hikes, see our art gallery, maybe buy something from the gift shop,” Urbanski said. “We even have people that didn’t expect to drop by the Crane Trust but we’re right off the interstate so they just come in, they explore, they use the restroom, they recharge and they head out.”\nThe Crane Trust is located off exit 305 on I-80, but during this time of year the cranes aren’t hard to find.\nClick here to subscribe to our KSNB Local4 daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2025 KSNB.
