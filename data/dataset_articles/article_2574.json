(Atlanta News First) - A destructive burglary was caught on camera in Gwinnett County.\nSecurity cameras captured four men smashing through the window of Chamoy’s Restaurant in Tucker on Sunday.\nThe owner said the thieves stole his cash register and hundreds of dollars.\n“I found the window broken, and almost everything destroyed,” Zoilo Rodriguez Tineo said. “They damaged the payment system and took the cash register.”\nThe damage totaled about $4,500.\nTineo said it’s not the first time this has happened.\n“This is the third time this has happened,” he said. “Still, the police do nothing.”\nPolice have found the orange Dodge Charger they believe the suspects were driving but have made no arrests. They say this is connected to a string of burglaries in the area.\nCopyright 2025 WANF. All rights reserved.",
