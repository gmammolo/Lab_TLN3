  "text": "Rotary Sunset led a cleanup on Saturday, 1 March 2025, in its adopted community of Washington Boulevard (Blvd), George Town.\nTwenty people participated in the cleanup including Rotary Sunset members and friends, members of Phillipine Guardians Brotherhood Inc. and some community residents.\nParticipants split into groups to clean Washington Blvd and the connecting roads over two hours. In the end they collected about 10 bags of garbage.\nThe club will also take part in a larger cleanup of the area on April 26 as part of Earth Day celebrations.\nThe club’s director for youth and vocational service Marie Martin initiated its adoption of the Washington Boulevard community in 2023. In addition to a cleanup there on Earth Day 2024, Rotary Sunset has organised games and activities for the neighbourhood Christmas party and given Christmas hampers to community members.",
