  "text": "Tibetan keeps close watch on 'sacred' black-necked cranes\nConservationist guards birds' nesting grounds on plateau lake\nEditor's note: As protection of the planet's flora, fauna and resources becomes increasingly important, China Daily is publishing a series of stories to illustrate the country's commitment to safeguarding the natural world.\nIn the grasslands of the Xizang autonomous region, Kyizom's work can be solitary.\nWith a motorcycle, binoculars, a bag of dry rations and a notebook in hand, she ventures alone into the grasslands, embarking on a new day's patrol.\n\"The black-necked crane is considered a sacred bird in Tibetan culture. People believe they are loyal in relationships, and I admire their dedication to guarding their loved ones,\" said Kyizom, a wildlife ranger at the Siling Lake National Nature Reserve.\nThe reserve in Shanza county, Nagchu city, Xizang, is an important breeding ground for black-necked cranes. As the only species among the 15 crane species globally that breeds and winters in highland areas, the black-necked crane is revered locally as the \"highland fairy\" and the symbol of happiness, auspiciousness and love.\nKyizom, a 29-year-old Tibetan, has been protecting black-necked cranes here for 10 years.",
