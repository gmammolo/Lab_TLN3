  "text": "Wuyuan's natural beauty mesmerizes\nNANCHANG — Since mid-March, Wuyuan county in Jiangxi province has entered its most enchanting season.\nAcross the undulating hills, a stunning expanse of 6,700 hectares of rapeseed flowers has burst into bloom, painting the landscape in vibrant hues of gold.\nAs the flowers reach their peak, waves of visitors from across the country witness this natural spectacle, turning Wuyuan into a bustling haven of beauty.\nScattered with historical sites and ancient buildings of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, Wuyuan boasts 30 traditional villages. In 2012, the county government adopted measures to protect and develop the ancient buildings.\nThe idyllic lifestyle has not only encouraged locals to return but also attracted many outsiders to settle down. Among them is Edward Gawne, the first British national to open a homestay in Wuyuan.\n\"There are trees, bridges, flowing water and beautiful Huizhou-style houses. It is how I imagined traditional Chinese culture would look like,\" Gawne said.\nWith China's ever-expanding high-speed rail network making the once-remote countryside easily accessible, Wuyuan has even attracted the interest of overseas travelers.\n\"Our B&B has served as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the West. About 90 percent of our guests are foreigners, and they can enjoy the beauty of Chinese traditional villages and learn about the culture and folk customs of Wuyuan and Jiangxi,\" Gawne said.\nThe story of Wuyuan is a shining example of how China's poverty alleviation and rural vitalization efforts have transformed the lives of countryside residents.\nOnce economically stagnant, the county of more than 300,000 people has undergone a remarkable transformation through land reform, poverty alleviation and infrastructure upgrades.\nSince the 2000s, Wuyuan has adopted an agriculture-tourism integration development model, combining traditional farming with tourism to develop distinctive industries such as rapeseed flower and chrysanthemum cultivation.\nThe initiative has spurred the growth of rural homestays, lifting the annual average per-capita income to more than 26,000 yuan ($3,600) in 2023 from less than 3,000 yuan in 2002.\nIn 2023, Wuyuan welcomed over 28 million visitors, cementing its status as a top-tier tourist destination in rural China.\nAs China's rural vitalization gains momentum, Wuyuan is further transforming its local resources into a thriving, diverse tourism industry. A nature education hub operated by young graduates has become an in-demand destination with eager participants booking spots three months in advance.\nFrom wetland explorations and building bird nests to observing bacteria under microscopes, the education hub's hands-on activities captivate children and parents alike.\n\"We're using Wuyuan's natural beauty and our expertise to make science fun and accessible,\" said Liu Zhilong, who runs the nature education hub, adding that over 60,000 children and 10,000 parents have joined their nature lessons.\nThese achievements stem from Wuyuan's groundbreaking \"mini nature reserve\" system, launched in the early 1990s. Today, the county boasts 193 such reserves, spanning 43,600 hectares and safeguarding rare species such as the critically endangered blue-crowned laughing-thrush.\nThis dedication to conservation has fueled economic growth, with bird-watching tourism alone generating over 100 million yuan in 2023.\nParty chief Xu Shubin stated that Wuyuan has successfully turned its ecological strengths into economic benefits.\nVillagers, now reaping the rewards of this green development, have become even more dedicated to protecting their beautiful homeland.\n\"This commitment has fostered a win-win cycle. Protecting the environment drives the green economy, and the resulting success inspires villagers to care even more for their natural surroundings, promoting true harmony between people and nature,\" Xu said.\nXinhua",
