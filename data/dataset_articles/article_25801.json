  "text": "Eustis installs lightning detection alarms at several parks\n\"It's an outdoor town, so that'll work well, I think.\"\n\"It's an outdoor town, so that'll work well, I think.\"\n\"It's an outdoor town, so that'll work well, I think.\"\nThis week, Eustis installed three lightning detection systems at area parks as a way to warn parkgoers of impending lightning storms so they can take shelter.\nThe systems were installed at Carver Park, Ferran Park (the Eustis Aquatic Center) and Sunset Island Park (the Eustis Service Center).\nBut the systems, while they are mainly designed for lightning strikes, also serve another public safety function: the ability for staff to quickly broadcast messages to the public at the park during emergency situations.\nThe systems are equipped with bullhorns and cameras and cost the city approximately 72 thousand dollars.\n\"It was something I felt the city needed, the parks and recreation department needed for the safety of our participants,\" said Parks and Recreation Director Sam Brinson.\n\"The horn will sound, our staff will try to come out and clear the park for the safety of the participants.\"\nThe systems will be able to track lightning within a 10 mile radius, and will sound the horn one time for the initial warning and three times when the threat has passed and it is safe to resume activities.\nThe next steps, Brinson said, include the city installing signage at the three parks to let parkgoers know of the new alarms.\n\"It's something that should be standard for all parks and recreation departments,\" Brinson said. \"Where I came from, in Miami, almost every department, parks and recreation department had lightning detection systems in their parks.\"",
