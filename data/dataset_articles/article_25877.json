  "text": "Beavers just saved the Czech government big bucks By Ashmeeta Subra March 13th, 2025\nA group of beavers have been deployed heroically to save a long-delayed project in the Czech Republic, sparing taxpayers two million dollars and protecting endangered crayfish.\nShare\nIn 2018, the Czech Republic government came up with a building project to protect the Klabava River and its critically endangered crayfish population. The aim was to build a dam to prevent sediment and acidic water from two nearby ponds from spilling over, but the project was delayed for years due to negotiations over land use, leaving the area’s environmental needs unmet.\nLuckily, nature had its own solution. Digging in to save the day, a family of eight beavers built several dams in just one night. Before construction could even begin, the beavers took it upon themselves and created the wetland envisioned by the officials. Not only did the industrious rodents complete the work faster than the humans had intended, they also doubled the size of the wetland area that was initially planned.\nAccording to Bohumil Fišer, head of the Brdy Protected Landscape Area Administration, the total savings to the Czech government were estimated at 30 million Czech koruna (about $2.58 million), which is essentially the entire cost of the original project.\nThe beavers even expanded their digging into a gully that was meant to overflow and flood the area, helping protect the river and its ecosystem. Beavers are known for their remarkable ability to protect against flooding, improving water quality and increasing biodiversity. Using rocks, mud, and wood to dam up streams, these semi-aquatic rodents create wetlands known as “beaver ponds,” which they use as sources of food and as protection from predators.\nIn London, reduced flooding and an increase in insects and other wildlife have been reported since the reintroduction of beavers to local waterways in 2023 . There beavers created six dams that helped the area retain more water, releasing it gradually after heavy rainfall.\nThere’s no denying that beavers are one of nature’s master engineers (with no Masters of Engineering required). Their hard digging reminds us of the importance of wildlife in maintaining the balance and health of our environment.\nPlanet Ark does not take responsibility for the accuracy of the original information and encourages readers to check the references before using this information for their own purposes.\nShare\nAshmeeta Subra With background in international relations and marketing communications, Ashmeeta is excited to use her skills to encourage positive environmental actions through Planet Ark.
