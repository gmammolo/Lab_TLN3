  "text": "Birdwatching: a boost for Australia's nature and conservation By Ashmeeta Subra March 13th, 2025\nBirdwatching has turned out to be a valuable force for conservation in Australia as bird lovers play a key role in supporting our unique wildlife.\nShare\nAccording to data from Tourism Research Australia, international birdwatchers contributed an impressive $2.6 billion to the tourism industry in the year leading up to June 2024. Domestic bird lovers added about $636 million, a 53 per cent increase from the previous year.\nThis trend can be largely driven by “twitchers” - birdwatchers who journey far and wide to get a glimpse of rare species. These passionate nature enthusiasts not only bring attention to Australia’s incredible birdlife, but also contribute to protecting it.\nConservation scientist Dr Rochelle Steven from Murdoch University said that Australia, known as the \"holy grail\" for birdwatching, is home to a wealth of endemic bird species that attract travelers from across the globe.\n\"It's easy for us to underestimate how valuable that experience is to international visitors,\" Dr Steven told ABC News.\n\"For someone from the other side of the world, seeing a common rainbow lorikeet is a huge thrill.\"\nDr Steven also noted the importance of birdwatching for both tourism and conservation, emphasising that Australia is home to the second-highest number of endemic bird species worldwide. Birdwatchers tend to spend large sums on transport, accommodation, food and tours as they travel across Australia in search of rare species. This support for local businesses helps create a positive ripple effect on small communities around the country.\n\"Almost one in six Australian birds are threatened with extinction, so recognising the economic value of bird tourism could drive more investment in conservation,\" said Kate Millar, CEO of Birdlife Australia .\nShe added that it is possible to strike a balance between conservation and responsible tourism practices to avoid over-tourism in sensitive areas.\nAs the birdwatching community continues to grow and more people take an interest in these incredible creatures, resources are more likely to be made available to safeguard precious bird species.\nPlanet Ark does not take responsibility for the accuracy of the original information and encourages readers to check the references before using this information for their own purposes.\nShare\nAshmeeta Subra With background in international relations and marketing communications, Ashmeeta is excited to use her skills to encourage positive environmental actions through Planet Ark. She believes that by taking small actions, we can help make a big difference and be good stewards of our planet. She also loves spending time in nature and being at the beach.\nStay up to date Whether you're looking for positive inspiration at home, at work or in the community you’ll find something in our suite of e-newsletters.\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters Suite 3.16 & 3.17 22-36 Mountain Street ULTIMO, NSW, 2007\nABN: 26 057 221 959\nPA Logo No Tag Copyright Planet Ark 2025 | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions\nPlanet Ark acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the land on which we live and work.
