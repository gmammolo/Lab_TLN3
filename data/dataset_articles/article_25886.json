Yet, it is being lost at an alarming rate, driven by deforestation and unsustainable economic pressures. ONE AMAZON introduces a new solution—leveraging the Internet of Forests™ (IoF™), a large-scale environmental intelligence network that enables real-time monitoring and monetization of the rainforest's ecological value. With major institutional partners, including PSG Digital, ONE AMAZON is now positioned to move from vision to execution, ensuring that the Amazon's protection is not only an environmental necessity but a long-term economic opportunity that benefits both investors and the planet.\nGorilla Technology Powers the Internet of Forests™\nAs a key technology partner, Gorilla is deploying AI-driven data intelligence, IoT solutions, and advanced analytics to create the world's largest environmental monitoring network.
