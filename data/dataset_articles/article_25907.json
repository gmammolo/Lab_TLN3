  "text": "Rehabilitated sea turtles get released\nBILOXI, Miss. (WDAM) - The Mississippi Aquarium released 19 Kemp Ridley sea turtles.\nKemp Ridley turtles are physically small but are a largely endangered species, so it was important for the aquarium to get them back in a space where they can thrive.\nThe public gathered to watch the sea turtles take their first step in an open body of water at the beach across from Edgewater Mall.\nThe turtles got released in fashion with a Taylor Swift-themed party.\nThe turtles were given friendship bracelets with their initials, and all the turtles are named after T-Swift songs.\nSome people who came to see the turtles get released were sponsors, which means they donated and supported the rehabilitation of the turtles.\nOne couple, the Andertons, sponsored a sea turtle named ‘Clean.’\n“It was really fun, it was something new, something different and something exciting to do on my 71st birthday,” said Martin Anderton, one of Clean’s sponsors.\nBoth Andertons said they were ecstatic to be a part of a little turtle’s life.\n“Watching him put Clean in the water, I had chill bumps, and I teared up,” said Tricia Anderton, one of Clean’s sponsors.\nWednesday’s event was the aquarium’s first creature release of the year.\nWant more WDAM 7 news in your inbox?
