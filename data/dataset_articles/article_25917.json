  "text": "The population of endangered Mexican gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico reached at least 286 in 2024, according to the latest census, marking an 11% increase from 2023 and the ninth consecutive year of growth.\nEnvironmental groups are pushing for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the wolves to spread north of I-40 in Arizona, rather than rounding them up when they stray outside the recovery area. Some biologists and groups argue the recovery plan should establish three distinct populations, including an area north of the Grand Canyon.",
