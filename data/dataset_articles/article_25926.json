  "text": "MPOGCF, through the Sabah Wildlife Department Wildlife Rescue Unit, is ensuring the future of Borneo’s cherished wildlife\nBEAMS of sunlight streamed through thick tree canopies, casting flecks of gold on the forest floor as Jibius Dausip made his way deeper into the dense Borneo rainforest, accompanied by a team of wildlife rangers from the Sabah Wildlife Department Wildlife Rescue Unit (SWD WRU).\nThey were on a mission, carrying out their daily routine—checking the perimeter for poacher traps, assessing the condition of the wildlife, and reporting anything out of the ordinary, among others.\nThe air was thick with the familiar, humid warmth of Sabah, and the steady rhythm of the jungle was already in full swing—birds calling, leaves rustling, insects buzzing and the occasional chatter of primates.\nAs an expert on Borneo elephants, Jibius had learnt to read the jungle like a book—interpreting its sounds and signs, knowing that one wrong move could change everything. His keen sense felt a shift in the wind—something didn’t feel right.\nHe grew wary and came to a halt, his boots sinking slightly into the moist earth. Suddenly, the sharp crack of breaking branches and a loud trumpet shattered the calmness of the forest. A deep, rumbling growl, laced with aggression, followed, and a massive body with furiously flapping ears crashed through the trees.\nWithout missing a beat, Jibius and his team began to backtrack quickly and deliberately, all while assessing the agitated elephant—it looked like it was hurt. They took the necessary steps to temporarily sedate the powerful creature to check for signs of injury, treat, transport and rehabilitate it.\nThis is just one of the many dangerous situations these wildlife rangers, rehabilitators, conservationists, researchers, and educators face on a daily basis.\nA team of WRU rangers around a Pygmy Elephant at Sepilok, Sabah.\nOrdinary people, extraordinary deeds\nDespite the risks to their safety, Jibius and other dedicated wildlife rescuers continue to confront the dangers of the jungle. Driven by a deep passion to protect Borneo’s unique biodiversity, they face numerous challenges and work tirelessly to preserve the island’s fragile ecosystems.\nFrom navigating treacherous terrain and rescuing animals, to treating and doing everything in between for critically endangered species such as the Bornean orangutan, pygmy elephant, sun bear, proboscis monkey and many more they ensure these creatures have a fighting chance at survival and avoiding extinction.\nAs a Malaysian Palm Oil Green Conservation Foundation (MPOGCF) Borneo elephant expert, Jibius expressed his desire to see sustainable practices become the norm, where both humans and wildlife can coexist in harmony.\nHe believes that conservation is not just about saving species, but about fostering a relationship in which nature and human activity can thrive together, ensuring that future generations inherit a balanced and flourishing ecosystem.\n“Pollution and climate change, driven by human activities such as illegal logging, have severely degraded wildlife habitats, destroying and fragmenting ecosystems, and placing species unique to Borneo at great risk.\n“Rescuing and protecting wildlife is vital for preserving the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Every species plays a unique role, contributing to the health and stability of the environment.\n“When wildlife is endangered or displaced, it disrupts this balance, affecting everything from plant pollination to predator-prey relationships. Protecting wildlife helps safeguard biodiversity, which is essential for our survival, providing resources like food, medicine, and clean water,” said Jibius, who is proud to play a role in conservation efforts with the SWD WRU.\nA Borneo pygmy elephant calf named Joe being cared for by SWD WRU staff Augustine David at the Lok Kawi zoo in Kota Kinabalu after it was brought back from Gunung Rara Forest Reserve where his mother and nine other elephants were found dead for suspected poisoning.\nSince 2010 to 2020, SWD’s WRU has rescued and translocated:\n> 314 Bornean elephant adults and calves,\n> 61 Bornean orang-utans adults and a baby,\n> 39 proboscis monkeys,\n> 144 estuarine crocodiles,\n> 19 Malayan sun bears,\n> 2698 long tailed and pig tailed macaques,\n> 43 sambar deers,\n> 16 gibbons,\n> 4 clouded leopard,\n> 77 marine turtles,\n> 43 pangolins.\nSince 2021, the WRU has received financial support from the MPOGCF, highlighting the ongoing commitment of the Malaysian palm oil industry to preserving Sabah’s biodiversity.\nThe unsung heroes\nEstablished in 2010, SWD WRU is dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating wildlife in distress. Their work focuses on animals that are injured, displaced, or caught in human-wildlife conflict.\nWhen wildlife is found in dangerous situations—such as elephants straying into villages or orangutans stranded in deforested areas—the WRU responds promptly, rescuing, treating, and relocating them to safer habitats, often within wildlife reserves.\nThe WRU provides medical treatment and rehabilitation to injured or sick animals, including endangered species like the Bornean pygmy elephant and orangutans. Once fully recovered, these animals are released back into their natural habitats.\nThe unit also contributes to wildlife conservation through research and education. By gathering data on local wildlife populations, the WRU helps inform effective conservation strategies. Public education initiatives are also a key part of their mission, raising awareness about the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment.\nSince 2021, the WRU has received financial support from the MPOGCF, highlighting the ongoing commitment of the Malaysian palm oil industry to preserving Sabah’s biodiversity.\nThe foundation’s efforts include a variety of initiatives such as the Guardians of the Wildlife Programme, the Borneo Elephant Sanctuary (BES), the Malayan Tiger Conservation Programme, and many more. Through these efforts, funded by MPOGCF, the WRU plays a vital role in safeguarding the region’s wildlife and promoting coexistence between humans and animals.\nMPOGCF conservation and sustainability manager Sahdan Kassim stated that the WRU's efforts in relocating wildlife will mitigate the impact of conflicts on plantations while simultaneously aiding in the conservation and protection of wildlife.\n\"While relocating wildlife is one solution, a deeper understanding of the movements of animals, such as elephants, is essential,\" he said.\nMPOGCF general manager Hairulazim Mahmud said Guardians of the Wildlife Programme is dedicated to protecting wildlife in Sabah. In light of the growing threats to both animals and their habitats, this initiative seeks to make a substantial impact through targeted conservation efforts and community involvement.\n\"The WRU rangers are vital to the programme's success. They play a key role in protecting wildlife and promoting conservation efforts. Their hands-on work helps build up the positive relationship between nature and local communities.\n\"They use their expertise to rescue and care for the injured and orphaned animals. We ensure that both the wildlife and the agricultural areas can thrive together. Their dedication truly makes a difference in our conservation efforts,\" said Hairulazim.\nJibius said: “My hope is that MPOGCF will continue to contribute funds to SWD WRU and for this unit to be able to give back by providing their energy to the wildlife department as well as the local community.”\nUltimately, we must recognise the value of all living beings—human, elephant, orangutan, or otherwise—because we live in a multi-biodiversity world where every species plays a vital role.\nThe efforts of individuals like Jibius and the SWD WRU serve as a wake-up call, urging us to realise that protecting non-human life is essential for the health of our ecosystems. Every life is worth saving, and it is our responsibility to act before it's too late.\nTo learn more about wildlife conservation and preservation efforts and programmes, visit www.mpogcf.org\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",
