According to initial reports from a NSW Ambulance spokesperson, the woman fell the height of two-storeys.\nPolice, paramedics and NSW Fire and Rescue were called to the scene. The Westpac Rescue Helicopter has also been tasked to the Glenrock area and was expected to winch her out of the bushaldn about 12.30pm.\nTeams had to reach the injured woman on foot, before she was treated by paramedics at the scene and moved onto a spinal board.
