  "text": "Case Insights:\nFrom Powerhouse to Pariah: Legendary defense attorney David Kenner faces potential disbarment following a criminal contempt conviction. Breach of Trust : Prosecutors revealed Kenner gave protected discovery to unauthorized individuals in violation of a protective order. Ties to High-Profile Clients : What could Kenner’s misconduct mean for Suge Knight, Tory Lanez, and the security of protected witnesses and confidential information? By Samuel Lopez – USA Herald\nLos Angeles, CA – Once celebrated for defending rap moguls like Marion “Suge” Knight, veteran attorney David Elliot Kenner now stands on the precipice of professional ruin.\nThe LA Times wrote an article about Kenner in 1996 called “Lawyer for Rap Mogul Known for Aggressive Work” written by Henry Weinstein.\nHe was a man who once held the fate of superstars in his hands, but today is fighting for his very right to practice law.\nKenner’s license to practice law in California—active since January 5, 1968—is at risk after a criminal conviction for contempt of court under 18 U.S.C. § 401(3) ​. His violation? Disclosing confidential discovery materials in a federal case to individuals explicitly barred from access—an act prosecutors described as “willful, intentional, and reckless” ​.\nIn United States v. Prakazrel Michel , the government charged Kenner with criminal contempt, alleging he “willfully, intentionally, and recklessly” violated a May 14, 2019 protective order​. According to court records:\n“Kenner shared and caused to be shared covered discovery material with persons to whom he was not permitted to provide the material under the terms of the order.”\nThe discovery material included grand jury documents and sensitive information meant only for defense counsel, and other authorized individuals.\nOver a period spanning from December 14, 2022, to March 3, 2023, these unauthorized individuals accessed confidential documents​ and grand jury minutes about his Grammy-winning client, Prakazrel “Pras” Michel , one of a trio who founded the 1990s hip-hop band The Fugees.\nKenner ultimately pleaded guilty. On January 26, 2024 , he was sentenced in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to one year of unsupervised probation and a $5,000 fine ​.\nThe plea was a stunning twist in a complex espionage case involving the former rapper.\nKenner’s history of State Bar violations includes an incident on March 22, 2002, when a conviction record was transmitted under State Bar court case No. 02-C-10990. Another violation occurred on April 17, 2003, resulting in disciplinary measures that included probation without an actual suspension. His most recent disciplinary action took place on June 27, 2024.\nThe Stakes at the State Bar Court With his criminal conviction now final, the California State Bar Court initiated formal disciplinary proceedings under Business and Professions Code §§ 6101-6102 ​​.\nAs of July 18, 2024 , the State Bar Court ruled that Kenner’s misconduct merited a formal hearing to determine:\n“Whether the facts and circumstances surrounding the violation of which respondent was convicted involved moral turpitude or other misconduct warranting discipline, and if so found, the discipline to be imposed.”\nUnder California law, conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude —conduct contrary to justice, honesty, or good morals—can result in summary disbarment . The stakes could not be higher: if found guilty, Kenner will be permanently stripped of his ability to practice law.\nThe State Bar Court has scheduled the next status conference for May 5, 2025 before Judge Dennis G. Saab​. Trial dates and potential discipline will hinge on whether Kenner’s actions are adjudged to meet the high standard of “moral turpitude.”\nAbatement or Delay? In a separate maneuver, Kenner’s legal team recently negotiated a Stipulation and Proposed Order to Abate Action ​. This agreement, signed November 14, 2024, temporarily pauses proceedings pending resolution of a related State Bar investigation ( Case No. 24-0-17730 )​.\nThe parties acknowledged in court documents:\n“The Parties discussed and agreed upon an approach for a universal settlement that includes the present action as well as the Respondent’s pending State Bar Investigation.”\nThus, while Kenner’s discipline remains pending, the clock is ticking.\nFallout: What Does This Mean for Suge Knight and Others? Kenner’s recent attempt to withdraw from Suge Knight’s defense —denied by a Los Angeles judge who ruled it was too close to trial—now takes on ominous significance. Is Kenner’s sudden desire to bail out linked to his own legal peril?\nGiven Kenner’s mishandling of confidential materials in the Prakazrel Michel case, serious questions arise about his access to protected information in other high-stakes matters—especially Knight’s ongoing civil retrial.\nKenner has also represented Tory Lanez, who was convicted of shooting and harassing Megan Thee Stallion .\nKenner’s recent conduct begs the question, if he mishandled protected materials in the past, could confidential information, witnesses, victims, or informants now be at risk?\nCould Kenner’s current or former clients possess leverage over Kenner—knowing he violated protective orders before—and use that information to pressure or manipulate him?\nKenner’s downfall should serve as a flashing red warning to the entire legal community. Protective orders are not suggestions; they are binding court orders with the force of law.\nAs articulated in the protective order Kenner violated:\n“No discovery material shall be provided to any individual or entity except as provided herein… or as further ordered by the Court.”\nViolations of such orders endanger witnesses, taint trials, and erode the integrity of the justice system.\nNo lawyer—no matter how high-profile—can place personal interests above their sworn ethical duties. – Samuel Lopez\nThe coming months will determine whether Kenner is allowed to remain a lawyer—or if his decades-long career will be erased under the heavy gavel of the State Bar Court.\nOne thing is certain: the legal community, the entertainment world, and the broader public will be watching.\nCase citation: Kenner, David Elliot.
