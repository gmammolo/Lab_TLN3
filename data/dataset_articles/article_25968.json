  "text": "At least three orca whales were spotted swimming through Bellingham Bay on Tuesday.\nBellingham resident Nate Wallace captured a video of the whales at about 4:30 p.m. as they were swimming south in the I&J Waterway along the Port of Bellingham.\nWallace told The Herald he was able to get the video from the deck of his apartment, where he lives with his family.\n“We were finishing up our workday and playing with the baby when we looked out our living room window and saw the orcas starting to swim back out of the waterway,” Wallace said. “We quickly went to our deck to watch as they swam by.”",
