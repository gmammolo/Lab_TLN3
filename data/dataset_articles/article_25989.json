  "text": "Wednesday, August 14, 2024 - 17:00 pm\nDepartment/Program\nChemistry\nResearchers in the College of Arts and Science recently created a liquid-based solution that eliminates more than 98% of nanoplastics from water. These microscopic plastic particles are an international concern, found in the world’s bodies of water and linked to health issues such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease. The innovative method offers a practical solution to nanoplastic pollution and paves the way for further research and development in advanced water purification technologies.",
