  "text": "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China has been making efforts in large-scale afforestation and sand control since the spring arrived, leveraging advanced technologies to explore new pathways for ecological governance.\nThese measures include the deployment of aerial transport devices to improve efficiency, precision planting vehicles, and the use of biodegradable containers to boost seedling survival rates.\nAs the frontline in China's battle against desertification and the primary defense against sandstorms, Inner Mongolia shoulders 60 percent of the national Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program's sixth phase of combating sandy land degradation.\nIn the region's Ordos City, the Otog Banner has embarked on a 50,000-mu (about 3,335 hectares) desert control project as part of a local sand desertification joint prevention and control project.\nOperators use drones to transport and deploy willow branches along preset routes, with the aid of ground staff for precise placement. Such aerial devices not only solve the logistical challenges of transporting materials in desert areas but also significantly enhance operational efficiency.\n\"A drone can cover 10 kilometers in just 10 minutes and make three round trips in an hour. In contrast, it would take a person over five hours to walk the same distance in the desert. This technology has greatly improved our work efficiency,\" said drone operator Wu Yaoxian.\nUnmanned tree-planting robots and semi-auto planting vehicles are also essential tools. The unmanned robots can move steadily across the sandy terrain, precisely inserting one-meter-long willow branches. In just 19 minutes, they can complete the planting task for one mu (about 0.0667 hectare) of land. This is a stark contrast to manual planting, which takes about eight hours to cover the same area.\nWillow and caragana, known for their rapid growth, adaptability and drought resistance, are key species in this effort. To further boost seedling survival rates, biodegradable containers are used together with mechanized planting.\nEven without rain for three months, these seedlings can thrive in the sandy soil. At the planting site, workers place willow and caragana twigs into biodegradable non-woven fabric seedling bags, mixed with a scientific ratio of planting materials in the soil.\n\"This new non-woven seedling container has water-retaining agents, rooting powder, nutrition and a mix of sand, weighing about five kilograms. It has increased the survival rate by 20 to 30 percent,\" said Bao Longshan, a staff member from the Ordos Three-North Project Promotion Center.\nMonitoring and evaluation are crucial components of sand control efforts. To precisely assess the effectiveness of these projects, the Ordos forestry and grassland department has adopted an air-space-ground monitoring system, which can ensure comprehensive coverage and meticulous management of every inch of land.\n\"This year, we have fully demonstrated and applied over 50 types of new sand control machinery, including intelligent sand barriers, tree-planting robots, and drone seeding. Currently, we have deployed 2,000 units, achieving a mechanical sand control coverage rate of 60 percent,\" said Song Junfeng, director of the Ordos Forestry and Grassland Bureau.\nAccording to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Forestry and Grassland Bureau, the region planted over 43 million trees through public participation in 2024.",
