  "text": "California lawmakers are urging the Los Angeles Dodgers to cut ties with their oil and gas sponsors following a formal request from Senate Majority Leader Lena Gonzalez. The LA Times reported that the senator urged team owner Mark Walter to end the Dodgers’ sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies, stating that their association with such corporations is not in the community’s or the planet’s best interest. One of the most prominent sponsors is Phillips 66, the parent company of 76 gas stations. The iconic 76 logos have been a fixture at Dodger Stadium for decades, appearing on scoreboards, outfield walls, and other high-visibility areas. However, Gonzalez’s letter emphasized the growing environmental concerns surrounding fossil fuel pollution, citing the harmful effects on air quality in Los Angeles and the broader climate crisis. The call to action follows a wave of activism against the presence of fossil fuel advertising in sports. Last year, environmental groups protested outside Dodger Stadium, demanding an end to these sponsorships. Additionally, a petition hosted by MoveOn.org has gathered nearly 23,000 signatures, urging the Dodgers to sever ties with Phillips 66. Gary A&period Vasquez-Imagn Images Activists argue that such sponsorships allow oil companies to engage in “greenwashing,” a tactic to build public goodwill while downplaying their environmental impact. California has been at the forefront of legal action against the oil industry , suing major companies, including Phillips 66, for allegedly misleading the public about climate change. The state has also targeted environmental violations by fossil fuel companies, with federal prosecutors charging Phillips 66 for U.S. Clean Water Act violations. Gonzalez pointed out that the Dodgers have historically been pioneers in progressive change, from breaking baseball’s color barrier with Jackie Robinson to banning cigarette advertisements from the stadium in the 1960s. She believes removing oil and gas sponsorships would be another step toward aligning the franchise with sustainability and public health initiatives. Despite the growing calls for action, the Dodgers have not yet responded to the request. With the team set to return from their season-opening Tokyo series, the debate over sponsorship ethics at Dodger Stadium is expected to gain further attention. Whether the organization takes a stand on the issue remains to be seen, but the pressure from lawmakers and environmental advocates is mounting.
