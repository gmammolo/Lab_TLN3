  "text": "Seedless persimmons power Thai Nguyen’s sustainable growth Thursday, October 16, 2025 | 17:09:48 (VOVWORLD) - The northern area of Thai Nguyen province (formerly part of Bac Kan province) will be harvesting of its seedless persimmons in late October. This autumn specialty has become a key cash crop that boost farmers’ income and improves their standard of living. Seedless persimmon trees have been cultivated for generations in the northern communes of Thai Nguyen province. Seedless persimmons are prized for their smooth skin, crisp texture, pleasant aroma, and lack of seeds. Unlike regular persimmons, they have a refreshing sweetness that appeals to consumers. In northern communes of Thai Nguyen, seedless persimmon trees have been cultivated for generations—some are nearly a century old—yet they still produce high-quality fruit. The best-known growing areas are Quang Bach, Nam Cuong, Dong Phuc, Na Phac, Ba Be, and Na Ri. Last year, the total area under cultivation was 830 hectares, turning out 2,000 tons of fruit. Grower Vu Thi Hue of Ba Be commune said, “This persimmon is very sweet. Every year I sell a large quantity to the market, and buyers love the taste. With better roads now, shipping is much easier.” Farmer Nong Sy Lap of Nam Cuong commune recalled, “My family has 6,000 square meters of seedless persimmons. This year’s crop is excellent, with yields much higher than last year. The fruit sells readily, bringing a good income. Traders and retailers come to the orchards to buy in person.” Thanks to the application of advanced technology, the persimmon orchards are thriving. In Na Chom hamlet, Dong Phuc commune—one of Thai Nguyen’s oldest persimmon-growing areas—local farmers established the Dong Loi Cooperative in 2018 to specialize in growing and marketing seedless persimmons. Other growers in the hamlet collaborate with the cooperative’s 20 official members, sharing techniques for planting, tending, and harvesting. Luc Van Thiep, Deputy Director of the cooperative, said, “The cooperative manages 43 hectares of persimmons, with 20 hectares currently in harvest. In a good year, we harvest around 150 tons. For 2025, the expected output is between 60 and 70 tons. Locals hope to further expand the growing area.” Thai Nguyen’s seedless persimmons were granted a Geographical Indication by the National Office of Intellectual Property in 2010 and named among Vietnam’s Top 100 Famous Brands in 2013, reflecting strong market demand. This year, farmers are selling the fruit for 76 to 95 US cents per kilogram. In recent years, local authorities have upgraded transportation infrastructure, paving roads right to the orchards. This has made transportation easier, reduced costs, and boosted sales. As a result, seedless persimmons are now widely consumed in Vietnam’s northern provinces, including Hanoi, Hai Phong, and Bac Ninh. Tourists visit the orchards to pick fruit, take photos, and buy persimmons as gifts—helping to spread the fame of Thai Nguyen’s seedless persimmons nationwide. The Dong Loi Cooperative has led efforts to improve product quality, expand markets, and diversify seedless persimmon products through processing—increasing the fruit’s competitiveness. This year, the cooperative invested in solar-powered drying technology to produce soft-dried persimmons. The product is chewy, sweet, fragrant, easy to preserve, and sells for a much higher price than fresh fruit. Dong Van Loi, Director of Dong Loi Cooperative’s, said this year they plan to process 5 to 6 tons of dried persimmon. One kilogram of fresh fruit yields about half a kilogram of dried product. “We’re focusing on producing soft-dried persimmons to diversify our products and increase our profits. The market response to our seedless dried persimmons has been very positive,” said Loi. Dong Loi Cooperative’s seedless persimmons have been recognized as an OCOP (One Commune, One Product) item. That helps fresh fruit reach the wider consumers and multiplies its value—transforming a seasonal product into a year-round specialty. Seedless persimmons have helped many households in mountain areas in Thai Nguyen improve their livelihoods. To maximize the economic potential of seedless persimmons, Thai Nguyen has boosted trade promotion on e-commerce platforms and social media, attended trade fairs, and connected with distribution networks. These efforts have strengthened brand recognition, expanded market reach, and boosted farmers’ incomes. In several communes, local authorities plan to further expand persimmon cultivation and link it with tourism—an effective approach to add value and ensure sustainable competitiveness for this local specialty. From traditional orchard fruit to recognized regional brand, Thai Nguyen’s seedless persimmon has become a symbol of innovation and sustainability that contributes to the economic growth of mountain communities.
