  "text": "EIB Global, the development arm of the European Investment Bank, has announced three major financing packages to strengthen its partnership with India, supporting clean water, sustainable urban mobility, and climate action. These investments, totaling over INR 5,200 crore, demonstrate EIB Global’s commitment to India’s national development priorities while advancing the EU Global Gateway strategy. The announcements coincide with EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer’s business trip to India in October 2025, during which she engaged with government officials, private sector leaders, and financial partners to promote innovative financing solutions for India’s green transition and economic growth.\nTo enhance sustainable urban transport, EIB Global is providing €289.5 million (around INR 3,040 crore), including €240 million for the Nagpur Metro extension and a €49.5 million top-up for the Pune Metro. These investments aim to shift passengers from road-based transport to efficient metro systems, reducing congestion, pollution, and CO₂ emissions while improving daily commuting for millions of urban residents. The Nagpur metro extension is expected to cut transport sector CO₂ emissions by 22%, and Pune’s network continues expanding access for over 100 million passengers, offering safe and environmentally friendly mobility.\nFor water infrastructure, EIB Global is lending $191 million (around INR 1,695 crore) to modernize and expand water supply and sanitation services in Uttarakhand. The project is expected to benefit approximately 900,000 people, including underserved and poor households, by providing reliable clean water, improved sanitation, reduced leakage, new connections, and enhanced monitoring.\nEIB Global is also committing up to $60 million (around INR 532 crore) to the India Energy Transition Fund, managed by EAAA Alternatives, a private sector initiative targeting a total fund size of $300 million. The fund will invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, transmission, battery energy storage, electric vehicles, and circular economy projects. The expected long-term impact includes the reduction of approximately 298 million tonnes of CO₂ and the creation of around 38 million job-years for India’s future workforce.\nAnnouncing the financing in New Delhi, EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer emphasized that these operations demonstrate the full strength of EIB Global’s partnership with India, delivering tangible benefits across clean water, sustainable transport, and the green energy transition. By supporting state-of-the-art metro systems, modernizing vital water infrastructure, and leveraging private capital for climate action, the investments aim to build resilient, healthy, and connected communities, advancing sustainable growth and improving the daily lives of millions of people.",
