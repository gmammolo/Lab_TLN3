  "text": "A side-event conference themed “Improve Nutrition by Leveraging Investments for Nutrition-Sensitive Food System Interventions in Tajikistan” was held in Dushanbe on 13 October 2025 as part of the Dushanbe International Investment Forum. The event focused on nutrition-sensitive food systems, sustainable agriculture, and green investment, highlighting strategies to combat malnutrition while promoting climate-resilient and inclusive agricultural development. It provided a platform to accelerate both public and private investment in nutrition, food security, and sustainable rural development in Tajikistan.\nThe conference was organized by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the World Health Organization (WHO), in coordination with the UN Resident Coordinator Office in Tajikistan and in collaboration with the Committee for Food Security under the Government of Tajikistan and other national partners. The event also commemorated the 80th Anniversary of the UN and FAO, reaffirming their shared legacy in advancing global food security and sustainable development. It brought together stakeholders from government, donors, the private sector, civil society, and media to identify investment-ready opportunities aligned with national development priorities, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and international green investment standards.\nMr. Mahmud Shirinjonzoda, First Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Food Security, emphasized that combining international support with national commitment addresses immediate food security challenges while building a sustainable, climate-resilient, and inclusive agricultural sector. Nutrition was highlighted not only as a public health priority but also as a catalyst for economic growth, with strategic partnerships seen as essential for achieving Zero Hunger and a healthier future for all.\nThe conference promoted innovation in climate-resilient agri-food systems and the development of inclusive value chains that support smallholder farmers, particularly women and youth. UN Resident Coordinator in Tajikistan, Ms. Parvathy Ramaswami, underscored the UN system’s commitment to building national capacities and catalyzing public and private investment for a nutrition-sensitive, climate-resilient food system.\nParticipants engaged in expert-led discussions on strategic investment areas, successful models in climate-smart agriculture, the economic case for scaling nutrition interventions, and climate resilience in Central Asia. Presentations also covered insights from the Investing in Nutrition Study, fortification processes, and private sector initiatives in Tajikistan. The event concluded with key messages, calls to action, and networking opportunities to foster partnerships and collaboration among stakeholders.\nThe conference was part of the joint UN programme “Transforming Food Systems for Better Nutrition,” financed by the Joint SDG Fund and implemented by FAO, UNICEF, WHO, and WFP in partnership with the Committee for Food Security under the Government of Tajikistan. The programme aims to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals by supporting nutrition-sensitive and climate-resilient food systems.",
