  "text": "BATHINDA: The 2015 Paris Agreement could help the world avoid 57 hot days if countries follow through on their emission-cutting plans and limit warming this century to 2.6°C, a new study has found.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now The report by Climate Central and World Weather Attribution shows the historic accord can help the world move toward a safer climate. However, the researchers warn that 2.6°C will still subject future generations to dangerous heat, cause severe health impacts, and widen inequality. They call for stronger commitments and policies to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and keep warming well below 2°C.\nThe report finds at 4°C of warming — the baseline level used in 2015 before the agreement was signed — the world would have experienced an average of 114 hot days per year. Today, if countries successfully deliver on their current emission plans and limit warming to 2.6°C, the world could experience 57 fewer hot days annually. Six recent heat events that scorched countries around the world would be about 5 to 75 times more likely than today at 4°C, but 3 to 35 times more likely at 2.6°C.\nKeeping warming well below 2°C is vital as heat becomes more dangerous with every fraction of a degree. Since 2015, an increase of 0.3°C has resulted in 11 more hot days globally and made heatwaves around the world much more likely, including by ten times in the Amazon , nine times in Mali and Burkina Faso, and two times in India and Pakistan. Adaptation finance is limited, and investments in early warning systems and action plans are still limited in many cities and countries.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Prof Friederike Otto, Professor in Climate Science at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, said: “The Paris Agreement is a powerful, legally binding framework that can help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. However, countries need to do more to shift away from oil, gas, and coal. We have all the knowledge and technology needed to transition away from fossil fuels, but stronger, fairer policies are needed to move faster. Political leaders need to take the reason for the Paris Agreement much more seriously. It is about protecting our human rights. Every fraction of a degree of warming — whether it is 1.4, 1.5, or 1.7°C — will mean the difference between safety and suffering for millions of people.” The 2015 Paris Agreement set the goal of keeping global temperatures well below 2°C and to continue pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, if possible.\nToday, warming has reached more than 1.3°C, and with emissions continuing to rise, some political leaders have questioned the effectiveness of the agreement. The study, however, shows it is helping move the world toward a safer climate. The first part focused on hot days — the top 10% warmest temperatures of countries around the world. At 4°C of warming, the world was expected to experience an average of 114 hot days.\nToday, if countries deliver on their current emission plans and keep warming to 2.6°C, the world will experience an average of 57 fewer hot days compared to 4°C. The second part of the study is focused on six recent heat events in southern Europe, West Africa, the Amazon, Asia, Australia, and North and Central America. These events fuelled devastating drought and bushfires, brought cities to a halt, and likely killed tens of thousands of people, researchers say.\nAt 4°C of warming, the heatwaves will be about 3 to 6°C hotter and 5 to 75 times more likely than today, the study found. At 2.6°C, the changes are smaller — about 1.5 to 3°C hotter and 3 to 35 times more likely. The study highlights the importance of avoiding every tenth of a degree of warming possible. Since 2015, an additional 0.3°C of warming has resulted in 11 more hot days per year and made heat events around the world about 1.5 to 10 times more likely.\nAdaptation is a core part of the Paris Agreement, and measures to boost resilience to heat have improved since 2015, the study highlights. Heat is the deadliest type of weather, causing an estimated half a million deaths each year. Historically, however, heat’s danger has been underappreciated because the impacts are less visible than those of other extreme weather events. The researchers say campaigns and initiatives have helped boost global awareness about the threat of extreme heat, and more countries have developed early warning systems and heat action plans, which are highly effective at reducing heat deaths.\nToday, about half of all countries have warning systems, and at least 47 have action plans in place. To further improve global adaptation to heat, the researchers say that many countries in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia still need to develop early warning systems and heat–health plans. They also emphasise the importance of national weather services issuing heat warnings. Only half currently do so worldwide. Long-term solutions, such as increasing shaded areas and trees in cities and strengthening health systems, are also essential to lower heat risks. Ultimately, the researchers say, the most effective way to protect people and minimise heat-related deaths is a rapid shift away from oil, gas, and coal — the main cause of climate change. The study was conducted by 18 researchers from Climate Central and World Weather Attribution. Dr Kristina Dahl, Vice President for Science at Climate Central, said: “The Paris Agreement is helping many regions of the world avoid some of the worst possible outcomes of climate change. “But make no mistake — we are still heading for a dangerously hot future. The impacts of recent heatwaves show that many countries are not well prepared to deal with 1.3°C of warming, let alone the 2.6°C of warming projected if – and it’s a big if – countries meet their current emissions reduction pledges. “Faster, deeper, and more ambitious emission cuts are crucial to ensure future generations live in a safe climate.” Roop Singh, Head of Urban and Attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: “The Paris Agreement is best known for its warming targets, but we’ve also made important progress on adaptation since its signing. “In the last decade there has been a steady stream of heat action plans and early warning systems. The danger of heat will only increase this century, so it is crucial that every country implements measures that help keep people safe. ” Bernadette Woods Placky, Chief Meteorologist at Climate Central, said: “The Paris Agreement works. It shows that when countries come together, they can accelerate emission cuts for a safer future. “The landmark accord is making a difference.” Dr Joyce Kimutai, Researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, said: “We are on track to exceed the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement this century—but this does not mean we need a new goal. Warming has to be kept as far below 2°C as possible. “The costs of inaction are accelerating faster than progress on adaptation and developing countries who are least responsible for emissions are suffering the worst impacts. We urgently need a rapid and sustained transition away from oil, gas, and coal. Developed countries that have caused most of the warming need to take the lead and move much faster. “But cutting emissions alone won't be enough. We also need to triple our adaptation efforts to protect lives and livelihoods.” Joseph Giguere, Research Associate at Climate Central, said: “Every fraction of a degree matters. From 2015 to 2023, with an additional 0.3°C of warming, the world now sees an average of 11 more hot days per year. “That’s not just a number — delaying the shift away from fossil fuels means millions more people are exposed to life-threatening conditions. “Countries need to act with the highest ambition to bring warming as far below 2°C as possible. ” Emmanuel Raju, Director of Copenhagen Centre for Disaster Research at the University of Copenhagen, said: “The majority of the world, primarily in low resource settings, are barely coping with extreme heat. This is a problem of injustice as people are pushed beyond their limits to cope and adapt. “We do know the full picture of visible and invisible impacts and the loss and damage of extreme heat. We need to move from survival to transformative adaptation. “The only way forward is to cut emissions, & make better commitments. More financing for adaptation; loss and damage is key to secure lives, livelihoods and society. Dr Theo Keeping, Researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London, said: “Our study highlights the danger of even seemingly small amounts of warming. “The Amazon Rainforest is crucial for the stability of the climate, but every tenth of a degree of warming is increasing the impacts of drought and heat on this essential ecosystem. “Over a decade, with 0.3°C more warming, six-month spells of extreme heat in the Amazon — like the 2023 heat that severely exacerbated the crippling drought — have become ten times more likely. On our current emissions trajectory, similar events are expected to hit the Amazon nearly every year.” To understand how climate change influenced the high temperatures, scientists from Climate Central identified local hot days by calculating the threshold temperature for the warmest 10% of temperatures from 1991-2020. These days, which exceed the 90th percentile of historical temperatures, are associated with increased health risks. They then compared the number of days exceeding this threshold to a scenario without climate change. To quantify the effect of human-caused warming on the heatwaves, scientists from World Weather Attribution analysed weather data and climate models using peer-reviewed methods to compare how these types of events have changed between climates with human-caused warming and the cooler pre-industrial climate.\nAbout the Author Neel Kamal An engineer by training but a journalist at heart, Neel Kamal writes about sustainable agriculture, environment, climate change and peace initiatives between India and Pakistan by peace groups on both sides.
