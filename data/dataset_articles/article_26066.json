  "text": "By Ellie Gabel ,\n46 minutes ago\nMany people like adding mulch to their garden beds for aesthetic reasons and suppressing weeds. However, they may end up creating a mulch volcano around their trees.\nFacebook user Bradley Seay posted a time-lapse video correcting this problem. As explained in the comments, he began by raking the mulch away from the tree's base, using an air spade to blast the excess soil, remove surface roots, and reach the root flare.\n\"This removes the likelihood of roots strangling/girdling the tree over time,\" he said.\nAccording to the National Association of Landscape Professionals, mulch buildup against the tree bark prevents roots from receiving enough oxygen, making them vulnerable to pest infestations, diseases, and circular root growth.\nWhen the flare is buried underneath soil and mulch, it can cut off nutrient transportation through the vascular tissues, resulting in the tree rotting and dying from asphyxiation.\nDespite the harm improper practices cause, mulching still has its benefits. In addition to keeping weeds at bay, it helps retain soil moisture and prevents erosion. Doing it correctly also stabilizes soil temperatures, decreases compaction, and protects plants from landscaping equipment damage.\nThe right way to mulch a tree is to place it in a ring around the trunk with a clear well. Organic materials, such as wood chips or fallen leaves, are most cost-effective.\nA better option may be to rewild the area around the tree base. This will save you money on buying new mulch and excessive watering, allow you to use fewer resources, and attract local pollinators without harming them with chemicals. Native lawn options, such as clover, buffalo grass, and xeriscaping, are great alternatives, while a partial lawn replacement has just as many benefits.\nPollinator species are under severe threat across the United States. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says bumblebee populations have dropped almost 50% since 1974, especially wherever temperatures have risen. Creating habitat for them is essential to promoting a healthy ecosystem.\nThe time-lapse video garnered some attention.\nWhat's the hardest thing about taking care of your yard?\nMowing the lawn\nControlling weeds\nKeeping pests at bay\nI don't have a yard\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\nOne user commented, \"I have never understood why people do that to their trees,\" and the OP pointed out that mulch volcanoes usually accumulate over time.\nAnother person expressed excitement about the results. \"Yay! Happy to see that happen,\" they said.\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more and waste less , and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.\nfirst appeared on .",
