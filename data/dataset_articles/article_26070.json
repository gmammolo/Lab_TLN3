  "text": "From Okwe Obi, Abuja The Federal Government has unveiled a greenhouse initiative to boost vegetable farming like tomatoes, pepper, avocado among others and to empower farmers. Executive Secretary, National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) Cornelius Adebayo, who spoke during an inspection tour at the Yakubu Gowon University greenhouse site, said the project, approved by President Bola Tinubu, seeks to end Nigeria’s over-reliance on seasonal vegetable farming and bridge distribution gaps that contribute to food shortages and high prices. Adebayo said the project includes the establishment of three temperature-controlled high-tech greenhouses in strategic locations nationwide, alongside net-house greenhouses in Abuja and Ogun. He disclosed that NALDA built 20 units and a nursery, while 30 units with a nursery are being set up in Shagamu, Ogun, adding that each site is equipped with packing houses, cold storage facilities, and solar-powered energy systems to ensure efficient operations. He said: “The greenhouse project is in three phases because we realised that one of the major problems we have with vegetables is that we depend too much on seasonal production. We approached Mr President for approval, which he graciously gave, for mega high-tech greenhouses across the country.” He further explained that the clusters will make fresh vegetables available closer to consumers in major cities like Abuja and Lagos, thereby reducing transport costs and post-harvest losses. He noted that young farmers will manage the facilities, with each youth allocated two net houses to run as independent agripreneurs under NALDA’s supervision. He said: “Most of these facilities will be handed over to young people who understand how to run them. The idea is to engage youth productively while ensuring food availability. “NALDA is also targeting women farmers through open-field vegetable cultivation. Under the second phase, the Authority plans to develop at least 10 hectares of open-field vegetable farms per federal constituency, with 100 women farmers per site growing pepper, tomatoes, and greens. “We are providing land clearing, irrigation, packing houses, and cold storage to support them. The 16 pilot locations, including Cross River, Taraba, Plateau, and Gombe, are already undergoing land preparation and irrigation works. “The Abuja greenhouse farm is expected to become fully operational by December 2025, while other sites will follow in early 2026. NALDA has begun enlisting farmers to manage the structures and will monitor compliance with global best practices. Addressing concerns about greenhouse safety, Adebayo clarified that the technology is safe and organic. “It’s just atmospheric condition control — very safe and cleaner. Plants simply need the right environment to thrive, and that’s what we’re providing. “Government is not in the business of business; our job is to create the environment for business to thrive.” He clarified that “each of the first 20 greenhouses in Abuja will be managed by 10 young farmers, with plans to expand to 50 units each in Abuja and Shagamu. NALDA is also urging state governments and communities to allocate more land for expansion.”",
