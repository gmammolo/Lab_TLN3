  "text": "Bodies of water are essential to Minnesotans’ recreation and way of life. As the Land of 10,000 Lakes, keeping the water clean helps to ensure a future for aquatic life.\nThere are many organizations statewide implementing measures and regulations to protect the watersheds that are the arteries of our communities — but are these efforts making a difference? According to a report published in September by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, in the Cannon River Watershed and areas spanning across the state, the short answer is yes.\nEvery 10 years, the MPCA and partners evaluate the waters of all the major watersheds in Minnesota.\nThe first monitoring cycle, which took place from 2006-2017, provided a comprehensive baseline characterization of those watersheds for the first time in state history. Now, the MPCA is in the second cycle of monitoring, which will span from 2018-2028, and is now seeing changes through their evaluation of those same watersheds.\nMPCA Field Biologist Dan Fettig was involved in the first round of monitoring and is now in the field working on the second. Data such as phosphorus levels, pollutant loads and nitrate amounts are collected, and information is calculated using the fish and macro-invertebrate, or insect, Index of Biological Integrity (IBI). This score is determined by various factors, with 0 representing a severely degraded condition and 100 representing a minimally disturbed ecological condition. With cycle one and cycle two, the IBI scores can be compared to observe any changes.\n“You can see, are things improving or are things staying the same?” Fettig said. “Is the health of the biological communities declining?”\nIn the Cannon River Watershed, IBI for fish has increased by an average of 7 points, and for macro-invertebrates, it has increased by 6.5 points.\n“The fish community is doing pretty decent,” Fettig said. “ The macro-invertebrate community is doing pretty good, but not as good as the fish community.”\nFettig said that a quarter of the streams in the watershed meet the fish IBI threshold to support aquatic life. This is beneficial because the conditions allow fish to thrive and migrate to different bodies of water.\nOut of 162 fish species in Minnesota, 73 were found in the Cannon River Watershed, making for a diverse fish population.\nIn the watershed, 22 new bodies of water were listed on the impaired-waters list, indicating they fail to meet one or more water-quality standards. However, the Cannon River had only one impairment area in cycle one. When it was reevaluated in the second cycle, the fish IBI increased by 35 points, allowing it to be delisted from the impaired-waters list.\nUsing the data\nWith water monitoring done and data gathered by the MPCA, other organizations and environmental groups can use that information to shape the work they do. Administrator for the Cannon River Watershed Joint Powers Organization Emmie Scheffler said, with the first cycle of monitoring, the group used the data to inform their watershed plan and identify what bodies of water were impaired and needing improvement.\nOverall, water-monitoring trends throughout the state indicate that fish and insect populations in rivers and streams are improving in most regions. Phosphorus levels in major rivers are either stabilizing or decreasing, water clarity in many lakes and streams is improving, and compared to the past, nitrate increases are slowing down.\nAlthough trends are showing positive improvements, more work is needed to make further progress, but the organizations can’t do it alone.\nScheffler encourages everyone to get involved and be mindful of their impact. Whether it is putting down salt to prevent slipping or spraying fertilizer, that material will end up in the watershed even if an individual doesn’t live near a water source.\nIf someone wants to help keep the watershed clean but doesn’t know how, they can visit the Rice County Soil and Water District office, and the staff can answer any questions.\nIf the work of Dan Fettig and his team sounds interesting, people can join the MPCA volunteer water monitoring program. Anyone can join, and no experience is needed. The MPCA will equip volunteers with the tools necessary to carry out water-clarity testing.\nLEARN MORE\nTo view the full MPCA water-quality report, visit pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/wq-ws1-42.pdf.
