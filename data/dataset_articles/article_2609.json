  "text": "The San Bernadino Community Service Center (SBCSC) is a non-governmental organization located in California, and is openly advertising legal support and voter registration for illegal aliens with criminal convictions. ProPublica reported $2,087,584 in revenue for 2023, up from $1,258,296 in 2022. SBCSC is yet another organization based in the United States, designed to illegally assist those who have broken the law to remain in the country. What makes this organization particularly alarming, however, is its focus on helping illegal aliens who may be guilty of severe crimes like murder or rape. The center posted a flyer on their Instagram account on March 6 directing “Noncitizens with a criminal conviction in SOCAL” on how to circumvent the law, and “legally” find a way to stay in the United States. That same social media post offered information about indigent defense offices in the SOCAL area: That’s not all. SBCSC isn’t just offering legal guidance for illegal aliens, they are also apparently offering to help them vote! In a video post from October 16, 2024, filmed completely in Spanish, the director of SBCSC stated that the center would assist those interested in the registration process: One could reasonably conclude that SBCSC is not aiming their voter registration assistance at citizens, therefore, deeming the center’s efforts illegal. After all, why would a citizen need to seek out the assistance of an organization that proudly believes “no human being is illegal?” That is verbatim what the center’s website states. Additionally, their mission statement reads as follows: “To strengthen the lives of immigrant families by providing assistance that empowers and helps them achieve social mobility; protect and unite individuals and families through legal representation, advocacy and education.” It’s concerning enough that SBCSC is helping criminal illegals to stay and vote in our country, but like most NGOs perhaps the worst part of the story, is that they’re doing it all under the protection of a nonprofit status. According to ProPublica , the San Bernadino Community Service Center is a designated 501(c)(3) that has been tax-exempt since October 2001. Such a status should not be available for an organization helping people to break the law. Yet, in the eyes of the progressives running NGOs like SBCSC, America is just a dumping ground for third-world criminals, and law-abiding citizens are just supposed to accept it and keep covering the costs.",
