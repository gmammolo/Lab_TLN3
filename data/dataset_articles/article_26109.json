  "text": "Mohammad Ali (@ChaudhryMAli88) Published October 16, 2025 | 02:30 AM\n(UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 16th Oct, 2025) ABU DHABI , 16th October , 2025 (WAM) – Under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister , Chairman of the Presidential Court , and Chairman of the board of Directors of the Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority (ADAFSA), Global Food Week will take place from 21 to 23 October at the ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi . The Week will feature local and international participation, bringing together an elite group of decision-makers, experts, and leading global companies specialising in the sector.\nThe event is organised by ADNEC Group, a Modon Holding company , in partnership with the ADAFSA, the Khalifa International Award for Date Palm and Agricultural Innovation, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Office. The event spans diverse areas, including food innovation, modern agricultural technologies, supply and distribution chains, sustainability, healthy nutrition, food security, and regulatory policies.\nThe events of Week benefit from a strategic partnership with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which is an international cornerstone in supporting efforts towards food security and agricultural sustainability. This partnership builds on FAO’s role in the previous edition and arises from its strategic collaboration with ADAFSA.\nFAO has contributed to enriching the global dialogue on food challenges and providing scientific insights and innovative policies to address climate change and promote sustainable production. This year, FAO is participating with a high-level delegation, further underscoring Abu Dhabi ’s position as a global centre for dialogue and joint action, reflecting the UAE ’s commitment to enhancing international cooperation to meet the growing challenges in the field of food security.\nDuring the press conference announcing the latest updates for Global Food Week, Ahmad Shaker, CEO of Capital 360 and Events, part of the ADNEC Group, said: “Organising this event is in line with ADNEC Group’s strategy to support events that advance national initiatives aimed at enhancing agricultural sustainability, adopting the latest technological innovations and quality investments, and establishing a sustainable food security system. This contributes to our vision of supporting national industries across various sectors, strengthening their competitiveness and ability to access new markets , while also attracting investment, fostering strategic partnerships, and facilitating the transfer and localisation of advanced knowledge in these vital sectors.”\nHe added: “This edition of Global Food Week is witnessing record growth rates across all performance indicators, including space, exhibitors, and participating countries, in addition to new accompanying events being held for the first time. The exhibition space has increased by 15% to reach 33,542 square metres compared to the previous edition, and the number of exhibiting companies and brands has risen by 9% to reach 2,070 compared to last year. This edition will also see 543 new exhibitors and brands participating for the first time.”\nHe confirmed that the number of participating countries has increased to 75, an 11% growth compared to 67 countries in the previous edition, with 18 countries participating for the first time. National companies represent 51% of the total, amounting to 1,055 exhibitors and brands. This growth reflects the demand from major global companies, decision-makers, and specialists to participate in Global Food Week, thanks to its reputation and international standing on the global events Calendar in the fields of food, agricultural innovation, and sustainable development.\nBadr Al Shehhi, Director of Communication and Community Engagement Department at Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority, said: “This year’s edition of Global Food Week marks a qualitative leap in the diversity of specialised events, reflecting Abu Dhabi ’s firm commitment to enhancing food security and supporting agricultural innovation. It embodies His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s keenness to strengthen food security locally and globally and to consolidate the emirate’s position as a global destination for conferences and exhibitions specialising in this vital sector.”\nHe added that this expanded edition of Global Food Week comes in response to the aspirations of the sector and addresses global challenges through a range of specialised events. These include the fourth edition of the Abu Dhabi International Food Exhibition (ADIFE), the eleventh edition of the Abu Dhabi Date Palm Exhibition—which returns as the region’s leading event dedicated to the date industry in the middle East and North Africa—and, for the first time, the launch of the Global Food Talks and the inaugural Agricultural Investment Forum, in addition to the Protein Alternatives initiative and the AgriTech Forum.\nDuring the week, the largest gathering of farmers, livestock breeders, and distinguished honey producers in the country will be hosted within the Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Agricultural Excellence Award pavilion, where we will celebrate the achievements and success stories of more than 150 Emirati farmers.\nHe noted that ADAFSA believes the week’s events present a strategic opportunity to strengthen international cooperation and exchange expertise.

This demonstrates Abu Dhabi ’s position as a global platform for cooperation and partnership-building in the palm cultivation and date industry sector.”\nHe added: “The organisation of the eleventh edition of the Abu Dhabi Date Palm Exhibition taking place during Global Food Week, reflects our wise leadership’s vision of linking dates as a strategic food and cultural pillar with major transformations in global food production and consumption patterns. In light of climate change and increasing food demand, it has become necessary to rethink our agricultural systems to ensure their sustainability and efficiency.”\nAhmed Al Obaidli, Chief Operations Officer at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi , a subsidiary of ADNEC Group, said: “Global Food Week is one of the most prominent events organised by ADNEC Group, featuring a range of leading activities that attract a wide range of decision-makers and specialists from around the world .
