  "text": "Japanese firm to help Hawaii achieve clean energy goals\nJapan’s largest power generation company has committed to help Hawaii achieve clean energy and decarbonization goals under a collaboration agreement.\nJapan’s largest power generation company has committed to help Hawaii achieve clean energy and decarbonization goals under a collaboration agreement.\nGov. Josh Green and the energy firm, JERA Co. Inc., signed a strategic partnering agreement establishing a framework for the collaboration on Oct. 6 during a weeklong trip to Japan by Green and more than a dozen other officials from state government including lawmakers.\nJERA has committed to eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from its domestic and international operations by 2050 through use of renewable energy, greener fuels and zero-emission thermal power.\nGreen, according to an announcement from his office Monday, also explored opportunities in technology and tourism for Hawaii during part of the trip in Tokyo where he met with leaders from Japanese technology firm NEC Corp. and the Yomiuri Shimbun Group, the owner of three newspapers and a professional baseball team that also has divisions involved in exhibitions and sports events.\n“Japan remains one of Hawaii’s most important partners — in energy, commerce, education and people-to-people exchange,” Green said in a statement. “This mission reaffirms our shared commitment to innovation, sustainability and friendship that extends far beyond the Pacific.”\nJapanese tourism to Hawaii has been depressed since the COVID-19 pandemic, and part of Green’s mission in Japan was to encourage Japanese travelers and international sports teams to visit Hawaii.\nGreen traveled to Japan on Oct. 4 and concluded his trip with the Hawaii delegation Monday.\nOther events attended by the governor and members of the delegation included Expo 2025 Osaka, and a celebration of the 125th anniversary of Okinawan immigration to Hawaii along with the 40th anniversary of a sister-state relationship between Hawaii and Okinawa.\nAlso while in Okinawa, Green renewed a 2010 cooperative clean energy partnership between the Hawai‘i State Energy Office and the Okinawa Prefectural Government.\n“Hawaii and Okinawa share more than history, we share purpose,” Green said. “Together, we’re proving that island communities can lead the world in clean energy and resilience, while honoring the cultural ties that bind us.”\nBefore returning to the islands, the governor was stopping in San Francisco to speak this week at Dreamforce 2025, a three-day conference produced by customer relationship management company Salesforce led by part-time Hawaii resident Marc Benioff.\nThe event, featuring talks by business leaders, actors, authors, comedians, musicians, government officials and others, starts today and is billed as “three days that will turn your AI vision into a clear plan of action for customer success.” It also includes a hackathon, a comedy show and musical performances by Metallica and Benson Boone.\nGreen returned to Hawaii on Wednesday.\nGet the Latest News\nhere.",
