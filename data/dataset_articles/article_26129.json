  "text": "As Nigeria moves to strengthen renewable energy manufacturing and champion local content, the European Union on Thursday said that creative partnerships between the public and private sectors, including research and innovation ecosystems, are key to achieving the country’s clean energy goals.\nDescribing how innovative breakthroughs are reshaping the global energy landscape, the EU praised Nigeria’s abundant and exceptional human talent and natural resources, describing them as critical ingredients for building innovation ecosystems.\nThe EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Gautier Mignot, who was represented by the Deputy Ambassador, EU Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Zissimos Vergos, disclosed this during the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum in Abuja, according to a statement by the EU.\nHe highlighted how over €200 million in grants from the EU has continued to strengthen the country’s power sector since 2008.\nHe said, “Our most recent energy sector programme, launched in 2021 with a €100 million (₦175 billion) budget, is aimed at adding 400 megawatts of new renewable capacity by 2027, directly benefitting more than five million Nigerians.”\nMignot noted that innovation that accelerates inclusive energy and digital transformation processes has become an essential intergenerational process and an integral part of political legacies that will be duly recognised by future generations.\nExplaining how proper synergy between the public and private sectors and research and innovation ecosystems works, he said, “The public sector brings the policy frameworks; the private sector brings agility and technical expertise; research institutions bring insight and innovation.”\nFurther stating that effective policies and regulations, together with strengthened capacity building, are essential to scale energy solutions sustainably, he added, “Across rural Nigeria, off-grid renewable solutions are transforming lives. Mini-grids and solar home systems, powered by creative public–private partnerships, are lighting homes, energising small businesses, and expanding opportunity.\n“Research institutions must continue providing evidence-based insights on energy demand, consumer behaviour, and resilient business models to ensure that innovation truly serves local communities.”\nReiterating the EU’s commitment to Nigeria’s energy security and economic resilience, especially through programmes like GET.invest Nigeria and the EU’s Global Gateway, he said, “The EU remains deeply committed to supporting these efforts through direct research grants, local capacity development, and mobilising private investment, demonstrating a shared vision for sustainable energy access, clean industry, and inclusive growth.\n“Whether for large grid-connected solar farms or small decentralised systems, our shared path depends on harnessing Nigerian ingenuity, industrial potential, and entrepreneurial spirit.”\nHailing Nigeria’s advancement in the era of the green and circular economy, Amb. Mignot added, “The pace of this journey toward sustainable, accessible energy will depend on how successfully the public sector, private sector, and innovation ecosystem work together.”\nPUNCH Online reports that Nigeria is currently working towards making significant strides in renewable energy, driven by government initiatives and international investments. The country aims to become Africa’s renewable energy hub, with a projected investment of over $410 billion by 2060.\nNigeria’s energy transition plan includes developing nearly 4 GW of local solar factory capacity, reducing reliance on imports, and creating jobs. The government has signed agreements worth over $400 million for renewable energy manufacturing and infrastructure deals, including solar panels, smart meters, and battery storage.\nAdditionally, Nigeria is promoting distributed renewable energy, with projects like mini-grids expected to reach 1.5-2 million rural customers.\nThe country has significant potential for solar and wind energy, with notable projects like the 140 MW Qua Iboe Power Plant and the 10 MW Katsina Wind Farm. Despite challenges like inadequate infrastructure and high costs, Nigeria’s renewable energy capacity is expected to grow, with projections indicating a compound annual growth of 9.88% from 2024 to 2034.",
