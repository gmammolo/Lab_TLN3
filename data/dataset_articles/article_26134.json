  "text": "Bury Council today celebrated the launch of the borough’s first community food-growing project under the new ‘Right to Grow’ initiative, with a group of enthusiastic neighbours who have established ‘Lancaster Roots’ in Ramsbottom.\nThe 'Right to Grow in Bury' campaign, launched in June, and is designed to encourage groups of residents to cultivate unused public land for community food growing. The initiative supports the creation of more connected communities while boosting local health and wellbeing.\nThe Lancaster Roots project is being spearheaded by neighbours Natasha Monaghan and Charmaine Jones, who have brought together 15 other local residents, all living close to the site.\nCharmaine said, “What began as a simple chat between these neighbours has grown into something truly special, which is already bringing people together in meaningful ways. The group is hopeful that their first planters will be in place soon, allowing them to begin growing vegetables and other produce right in the heart of the neighbourhood.”\nTheir vision for the land, which is currently derelict, includes the installation of raised vegetable beds, the creation of a wildlife pond, and the planting of fruit trees, all aimed at enhancing biodiversity and providing fresh, accessible produce for the neighbourhood.\nThey have been fortunate to have guidance from Incredible Edible, and valuable support from Bury Council’s Lee Buggie, Kathy Taylor, Mark Townsend and others. Commenting on this inspiring community effort, Lee said, “This is amazing work. Many people have come together to make this happen, and I’m proud to be involved in this project. We hope to have more sites like this spring up throughout the borough.”\nCouncillor Alan Quin, cabinet member for environment, climate change and operations, said: “I am delighted to see how our Right To Grow initiative has taken shape, and I am excited to see the future work of the Lancaster Roots as they make their local area more green, biodiverse, and delicious with all the fresh food they will be growing. I hope this encourages residents from across Bury to take part in Right To Grow and bring their communities together. This is a great initiative not only for sustainable food growth and the environment, but it is also a great way to bring neighbours, friends, and groups together and demonstrate what being a Bury resident is all about: community. If you are interested in starting your own group, don’t hesitate to get in touch.”\nThe initial success of Lancaster Roots demonstrates the power of residents working together using the Right to Grow. They’ll be in a group which will benefit physical & mental health and local sustainability for years to come.\nGet Involved: Start Your Own Right to Grow Project Lee encourages any residents who are inspired by Lancaster Roots to start their own growing project on spare land in their area.\nIf you wish to initiate a new community growing site, please email Andrew at Incredible Edible on iepad.volunteers@gmail.com . This would be your first step in turning unused land into a flourishing local resource.\nENDS\nNotes for editors: Right to Grow is a programme for communities to grow more food on public land. Led by the local council, it involves maintaining a food map showing sites that are suitable for growing. The programme is led by Incredible Edible UK, and has gained broad support, from local community groups right up to the House of Lords. It is also supported by multiple councils, with Hull City Council passing the first Right to Grow motion and policy in 2023. Residents can email iepad.volunteers@gmail.com with their suggestions for potential growing sites Incredible Edible Prestwich are a local community group growing food in public spaces in and around Prestwich. They helped to establish the Right to Grow in Bury as part of UK wide effort with all local authorities. Bury Council is the local authority of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury in Greater Manchester. It provides the majority of local government services and is a member of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority.
