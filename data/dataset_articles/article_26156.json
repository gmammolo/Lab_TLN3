  "text": "OSMP workers remind us that kindness, decency still exist\nOn Thursday evening, Oct. 2, my wife and I visited Flagstaff around 6:30 p.m. While we were at the west overlook, we met 2 Open Space & Mountain Parks rangers and enjoyed a pleasant conversation. Both rangers were friendly, engaging and good-humored as they went about their duties. They made us feel both secure and genuinely welcome. In a world where anger and incivility so often dominate the headlines, it was uplifting to be reminded that kindness and decency are still very much alive.\nGeorge Craft, Boulder\nDenied entry because of Free Palestine shirt\nIt isn’t just performers who have been harassed and canceled for their speech, but audiences as well. Last Friday, I was denied entry to a music concert at Fiddlers Green because I was wearing a Free Palestine T-shirt. I could only enter if I put on a jacket, and was given a stern warning at the gate to keep the jacket on. Does anyone else find this absurd? I truly found it laughable that a little old lady such as myself was deemed some type of threat because of my clothing. How long has this been going on? Is this really America?\nAnn Krohn Rick, Longmont\nIs it time to be friends with China?\nI was watching a Sunday morning TV commentator who said in effect, “Why are all the former liberal Silicon Valley heads of major corporations drifting right and cozying up to President Trump”? The answer given by the guest was that they are in the business of making money, and, understandably, want to be close to a power that will help them make more. And, President Trump is one of the most powerful persons in the world.\nIndeed, President Trump is probably second in world power only after the head of China, Xi Jinping, since the U.S. is now shrinking in terms of international influence and military power, with the possible exception of our worldwide nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.\nWe have savaged the United Nations and NATO while the Chinese have created the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, representing some 43% of the world population, and attended by nations in 2025 including our once-friendly ally India. While we have reduced our Agency for International Development, the Chinese have continued to expand their Belt & Road Initiative from Asia and Africa to South America.\nWith four times the population of the U.S., the size of China’s economy as compared to the U.S. in 2024 was $38 trillion of Purchasing Power Parity, compared to ours at $30 trillion, which might be understated since China has the world’s largest underground economy.\nThey are challenging our lead in AI with the recent release of their homegrown DeepSeek, and with their policy of support for open AI, which will accelerate their development of applications.\nA RAND report in 2017 found that “China was increasingly capable of challenging U.S. military dominance in the Western Pacific.” Since then?\nMaybe it’s time to recognize China as a competitor, but to also reach out to them in friendship.\nDonald Bryan, Boulder\nWe need energy from wherever we can get it\nBill Wright’s piece on energy in the Oct. 4 Camera is worth studying. Let me say part of it in a different way. If you increased the amount of wind and solar energy produced in the U.S. by a factor of 10, and you assume it’s all dispatchable; that is available as needed 24/7, night or day, rain or shine, and that this increase reduces energy from fossil fuel by the same amount, then the amount of energy produced from fossil fuel would still be more than twice as much as wind and solar. Wind and solar energy are never going to eliminate the need for oil and gas. The truth is, they aren’t even going to reduce it. They’re going to supplement it. Energy demand continues to increase. We’re going to need all we can get from wherever we can get it. The paradox is this — the thing that makes fossil fuel so valuable is that it’s so cheap.\nTom Chapin, Lyons\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by email or mail.",
