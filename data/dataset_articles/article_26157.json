Emissions pledges have reduced projected warming to 2.6°C, down from an earlier trajectory of 4°C. According to Climate Central and World Weather Attribution, this shift means 57 days of extreme heat annually by century’s end, compared with a projected 114 days without steps taken by countries following the Paris Agreement. Scientists call the difference “a matter of life and death,” as extreme heat drives droughts, wildfires, and billions in damages. Still, the goals are slipping out of reach amid political fractures, and COP30 in Brazil next month will reignite debate over global emissions efforts.\n***\nFurther reading: Paris Pledges Would Curb Extreme Heat But Climate Goals at Risk\nBig tech faces scrutiny over carbon accounting\nTech giants, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, are under scrutiny as the world’s top carbon accounting body, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, considers major revisions to Scope 2 emissions rules. The update could limit companies’ reliance on renewable energy certificates (RECs), which critics say allow misleading “carbon-free” claims. In an unlikely matchup, RECs are under the scrutiny of both climate scientists and Republican lawyers. Both groups allege that RECs distort the reality of fossil-powered grids, while the proposed changes would force hourly reporting of energy use and location-based accounting. If implemented, the update could end the use of RECs altogether, reshaping corporate decarbonization strategies and closing a major loophole in global emissions reporting.\nKlimado– Navigating climate complexity just got easier. Klimado offers a user-friendly platform for tracking local and global environmental shifts, making it an essential tool for climate-aware individuals and organizations.\n***\nFurther reading: Climate Scientists and Republican Lawyers Are Taking Aim at Big Tech’s Emissions\nNvidia backs $2.9B renewable data center in Australia\nNvidia and Australian startup Firmus Technologies are investing nearly €2.5 billion in renewable-powered data centers across Australia. The first two facilities are located in Melbourne and Tasmania, and will run on 150 megawatts of power using Nvidia’s advanced GB300 chips, launching by April 2026. The project, called Project Southgate, could expand to 1.6 gigawatts of capacity by 2028, backed by more than 5 gigawatts of new solar, wind, and hydro generation. The initiative highlights how AI demand is accelerating renewable development. In Australia, renewables are adding 5% to installed power capacity while promoting domestic “sovereign” AI infrastructure.\n***\nFurther reading: Nvidia Partners in $2.9 Billion Australia Data Center Drive\nNewsom vetoes port bill to preserve air quality oversight\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a state bill that would have restricted local air quality regulators’ ability to curb pollution at the largest ports in the U.S., the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. The proposed measure would have barred the South Coast Air Quality Management District from limiting cargo or passenger throughput, a move environmental advocates said would weaken oversight at one of the country’s worst pollution hotspots. Critics claim California’s environmental regulations are burdening businesses and raising costs, but Newsom continues to counter federal rollbacks under the Trump administration. The veto fits with his bold environmental agenda, which in recent months has included strong PFAS and air quality regulations across California’s consumer products and industrial sectors.\n***\nFurther reading: California governor vetoes bill that would have limited air pollution regulation\nEditor’s Note: The opinions expressed here by the authors are their own, not those of impakter.com — Cover Photo Credit: Mika Baumeister",
