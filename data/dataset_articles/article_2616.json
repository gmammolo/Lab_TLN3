  "text": "Ocala skating coach faces additional sexual assault charges\nOCALA, Fla. (WCJB) - TV20 has a new update on the case against a youth coach and skating rink owner in Ocala.\n62-year-old Richard Hawkins, who people also know as “Spanky,” is already in custody for inappropriately touching a minor.\nHe now faces an additional charge of lewd and lascivious molestation of a minor after another victim came forward.\nAn arrest affidavit obtained by TV20 says Hawkins used his status as the new victim’s coach to manipulate him and tried to touch him inappropriately.\nIn February, we reported on Hawkins’ arrest following an investigation into his contact with a 16-year-old boy.\nHawkins was listed as a co-owner of “Skate Away South” in Ocala.\nRELATED: Skating rink owner, youth coach arrested for sexual activity with 16-year-old in Ocala\nClick here to subscribe to our newsletter.\nCopyright 2025 WCJB.
