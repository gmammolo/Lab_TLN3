  "text": "NEW YORK , April 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --\nWhy: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOUN , SOUNW) between May 10, 2024 and March 3, 2025 , both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), of the important May 27, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.\nSo what: If you purchased SoundHound securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.\nWhat to do next: To join the SoundHound class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36267 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than May 27 , 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.\nWhy Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDetails of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the material weaknesses in SoundHound's internal controls over financial reporting impaired SoundHound's ability to effectively account for corporate acquisitions; (2) in addition, SoundHound overstated the extent to which it had remediated, and/or its ability to remediate, the material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting; (3) as a result of the foregoing material weaknesses, SoundHound's reported goodwill following the Amelia Acquisition was inflated and would need to be corrected; (4) further, SoundHound would likely require extra time and expense to effectively account for the SYNQ3 and Amelia Acquisitions; (5) the foregoing increased the risk that SoundHound would be unable to timely file certain financial reports with the SEC; and (6) as a result, SoundHound's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the SoundHound class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36267 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for more information.\nNo Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.\nFollow us for updates on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rosen-law-firm , on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rosen_firm or on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/rosenlawfirm/ .\nAttorney Advertising.
