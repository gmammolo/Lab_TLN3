  "text": "KUCHING (Oct 16): Investors in Sarawak who adopt green energy are expected to gain a ‘green premium’ for their products, reflecting the rising global demand for low-carbon and environmentally sustainable goods, said Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.\nHe said this aligns with the world’s growing preference for products manufactured using renewable energy, positioning Sarawak’s green energy as a major value proposition for both foreign and domestic investors.\n“This means their products will be easier to sell because their production processes are low carbon.\n“The world is now seeking green products that do not harm the environment,” he said during the opening of the Sarawak Mega Fair 2025 at Suntec Singapore Exhibition and Convention Centre in Singapore today.\nAbang Johari highlighted that Sarawak offers a wide range of investment incentives to attract international investors — including those from Singapore — particularly in clean energy and sustainable industries.\nHe explained that the state government provides incentives on par with those offered by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA), complemented by additional state-level advantages such as favourable land pricing, land premiums, and competitive industrial energy tariffs.\n“At present, Sarawak has the lowest industrial energy tariffs in Malaysia,” he said.\nAbang Johari said the specific forms and rates of incentives would be determined according to the scope and type of investment, through consultation with relevant agencies such as Sarawak Energy Berhad and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Urban Development, ensuring a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability.\nHe added that Sarawak’s political and administrative stability remains a crucial factor in bolstering international investor confidence.\n“Therefore, with a solid foundation of stability, investor-friendly policies, and sustainable green energy resources, Sarawak is on the right path to become a leading green energy hub and a top investment destination in the region by 2030,” he said.",
