  "text": "Funds will support town’s risk management efforts The Town of Franklin was awarded a $10,000 grant from the Massachusetts Interlocal Insurance Association (MIIA) , the town’s property and casualty insurance provider, to support the installation of Samsara GPS modules that improve the town’s ability to track and manage fleet operations thereby enhancing the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of its public works operations. MASS Interlocal\nInsurance Association (MIIA)\nWith real-time GPS tracking, the town can monitor winter operations more closely and calculate salt and calcium usage with greater precision, ensuring materials are applied as economically and effectively as possible.\nThe technology also provides diagnostic information that enables faster identification and repair of town vehicle performance issues, reducing environmental impact and preventing more costly repairs. Additionally, integration with Franklin’s new fuel system enables more accurate fuel tracking and reporting, allowing the town to better understand and reduce its environmental footprint over time.\n“This grant is helping us improve how we manage operations, respond to maintenance needs, and make informed decisions about future vehicle investments,” said Jay Stearns, Franklin’s Fleet Manager . “With these new tools, we’re better equipped to serve residents, operate efficiently, and reduce our environmental impact.”\nFor the 2025 fiscal year, MIIA awarded $1 million to fund over 150 grant requests from members for public safety activities and equipment. Municipalities were able to conduct HVAC evaluations, purchase confined space safety equipment, and conduct boiler and water loss prevention measures, among many other initiatives.\n“This grant is about real-world impact – helping municipalities reduce claims, safeguard municipal assets, and protect workers,” said Stan Corcoran, MIIA Executive Vice President. “Helping our members build safer communities is central to MIIA’s mission, and we’re pleased to support Franklin as it strengthens efforts to prevent losses and protect both employees and residents.”\nMIIA is a membership service of the Massachusetts Municipal Association. As a mission-driven, member-led nonprofit, MIIA focuses on providing Massachusetts municipalities and other governmental entities with insurance coverage alternatives, quality risk management, and wellness programs.\nFor over four decades, MIIA has proudly supported its members in their efforts to build stronger communities, foster safer work environments, and implement programs that promote the health and well-being of their employees.
