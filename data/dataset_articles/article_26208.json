  "text": "FloLogic introduces PinPoint Sensors, offering advanced monitoring for household flooding and leaks PR Newswire Today at 11:01am UTC FloLogic introduces PinPoint Sensors, offering advanced monitoring for household flooding and leaks PR Newswire\nMORRISVILLE, N.C., Oct. 16, 2025\nNew sensor technology expands FloLogic's ability to protect property and provide oversight\nMORRISVILLE, N.C. , Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- FloLogic ®, a pioneering brand of plumbing leak detection technology, and a subsidiary of Bradford White Corporation , has introduced FloLogic PinPoint® point of leak and environmental sensors. These advanced sensors provide location-specific leak and room condition monitoring for instant, automatic water shutoff at the presence of water accumulation or low temperatures and provide additional monitoring and notifications of humidity levels.\nAs catastrophic storm and wildfire events increase in frequency and severity, insurers are becoming more focused on loss categories that are preventable. With non-weather water damage representing the second largest category of property insurance claims, insurers have begun to require leak detection technology as a condition of coverage for a growing portion of insurance policies. The expanded FloLogic offering provides a comprehensive solution that helps property owners obtain insurance coverage and optimize their premium rates, while protecting their valued assets.\n\"PinPoint sensors demonstrate FloLogic's commitment to offer the most comprehensive technologies for prevention of catastrophic water damage,\" said Douglass Phillips , general manager of FloLogic. \"This new solution is the latest addition to the FloLogic Gateway platform in which a Thread-based wireless mesh network allows simple device pairing and extended battery life compared to WiFi.\"\nFloLogic PinPoint sensors provide immediate leak puddle detection and auto water shutoff by a FloLogic valve. PinPoint sensors also monitor ambient temperature and humidity for notifications and auto water shut off in freezing conditions. As some commercial and multifamily properties are unable to utilize flow-based leak detection, PinPoint sensors can be installed without the presence of a FloLogic valve to provide protection for such properties, while when installed in a property with a FloLogic valve, they can be set in an alert-only mode when monitoring for water intrusion sources beyond the plumbing supply.\n\"As property owners become increasingly proactive about risk and insurability, PinPoint sensors give them expanded protection over virtually all forms of water damage,\" Phillips said. \"It also allows FloLogic to help protect an even broader range of properties and give more discerning owners the peace of mind they desire.\"\nFor more information about FloLogic, visit https://flologic.com .\nAbout FloLogic\nBased in Morrisville, NC , FloLogic has been a pioneering brand of plumbing leak detection and automatic water shutoff solutions since 1999 and has become a trusted name in the marketplace for innovative solutions.
