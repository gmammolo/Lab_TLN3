Officers say they saw Adams driving the stolen car a short time later and started following him.\nOfficers say they had to stop chasing Adams because he was driving recklessly and putting people’s lives at risk.\nThey later found the stolen car parked behind a house Adams stayed at, according to police.\nPolice state that they also found documents with the victim’s name on them inside that house.\nAdams is at the Hamilton County Detention Center on a $$300,000 bond.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
