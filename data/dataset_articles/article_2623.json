  "text": "Police & Fire\nCar crashes through front of Park City Visitor Center\nPARK CITY, Utah – The Park City Fire Department responded to the Park City Visitor’s Center on Wednesday afternoon after a car drove through main entrance of the building causing what Fire Marshal Mike Owens of PCFD called “significant superficial damage.”\nOwens reported that no one was injured and there was no structural damage to the building as a result of the accident.\n“This was a lucky one with the only damage being to the vehicle and the building. I’m glad the person was wearing a seatbelt,” Owens said.\nOfficials did not state the cause of the crash. This is a developing story.",
