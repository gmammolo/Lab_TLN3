  "text": "DP World expands electric fleet tenfold at Jebel Ali Port\nThe upgraded fleet includes 35 diesel-powered vehicles converted to electric by DP World’s in-house engineering teams, alongside more than 100 newly acquired units sourced from leading international manufacturers, the company said. To charge the vehicles, the company has installed a network of rapid charging stations across Jebel Ali Port.\nIn addition to the eITV deployment, the company has introduced eleven electric empty container handlers for stacking and transporting empty containers within the terminal area. According to DP World, these additions are intended to accelerate the transition towards low-emission operations and contribute to the UAE’s national clean energy objectives.\nMoreover, DP World received the first electric trucks from Einride in March. The full fleet of 100 connected electric trucks will be delivered in 2026.\n“Electrifying our port operations is a strategic priority that supports the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 ambitions,” said Abdulla Bin Damithan, CEO and Managing Director of DP World GCC. “By scaling our electric fleet and transitioning to cleaner energy at Jebel Ali Port, we are building future-ready and more resilient supply chains that benefit our customers and the communities we serve.”\nAccording to the company, with maritime transport accounting for around 3 per cent of global transport-related emissions, electrifying operations at major logistics hubs such as Jebel Ali Port represents a tangible step towards decarbonising international trade. The expansion of the fleet is expected to reduce diesel consumption and cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 10 per cent, equivalent to taking 2,255 cars off the road annually.",
