  "text": "To quote Bubbanomics. The law of unintended consquences bites hard. Trump tries to kill renewables — and accidentally sparks green energy boom. Its just like the recent ending of the EV tax credits, a mad rush to get them before they’re gone.\nThe president signed a massive, controversial tax cut megabill earlier this year that, among other things, phases out most tax credits for renewable energy installation at the federal level. In fact, the rush to take advantage of the tax credits as they sunset is so tremendous \"that analysts widely expect the United States to add record — or near-record — amounts of renewable energy and batteries through 2027\" with the research firm BloombergNEF revising up their forecast for new wind, solar, and battery installations in 2026 by 10 percent. Wind and solar projects must be under construction by July to be eligible for federal tax credits that Congress voted this summer to eliminate, years earlier than previously required,\" the report continued. \"To hit that deadline, many developers have ordered custom power transformers — devices used to increase or decrease voltage — solar panels and other equipment much sooner than they normally would have. Placing such orders is one way to demonstrate to the Internal Revenue Service that a project is underway. CleanCapital director Thomas Byrne told The Times,“There’s this huge hurry-up that is taking place.”\nThe president signed a massive, controversial tax cut megabill earlier this year that, among other things, phases out most tax credits for renewable energy installation at the federal level.\nIn fact, the rush to take advantage of the tax credits as they sunset is so tremendous \"that analysts widely expect the United States to add record — or near-record — amounts of renewable energy and batteries through 2027\" with the research firm BloombergNEF revising up their forecast for new wind, solar, and battery installations in 2026 by 10 percent.\nWind and solar projects must be under construction by July to be eligible for federal tax credits that Congress voted this summer to eliminate, years earlier than previously required,\" the report continued. \"To hit that deadline, many developers have ordered custom power transformers — devices used to increase or decrease voltage — solar panels and other equipment much sooner than they normally would have.

By the end of 2024, a total of 4,443 GW of renewable energy was installed globally, versus the tripling target of 11,174 GW.

For example, in 2024 we didn’t have the impulse to capture tax credits noted above, nor vast expansion of renewables in Africa that appeared this year. Thus, as we have seen before, but is worth repeating:\nFor a long time renewable energy uptake in Africa was lacklustre at best.

Natural forest regrowth in the world’s tropical rainforests is expanding. more than 11 million hectares (27 million acres) of tropical moist forests are under some stage of forest regrowth between 2015 and 2021. “We’d rather see that regrowth than not, of course. But increased regrowth is not a straightforward piece of good news,” “Tropical forests wouldn’t be regrowing if they weren’t cleared in the first place. An increase in regrowth is often correlated to an increase in loss.” Yet natural regrowth offers a promising low-cost path to widespread restoration in tropical rainforests. If protected from new clearings and left to their own devices, these forests can help ecosystems recover, sequester and store carbon as the trees grow and slowly restore lost biodiversity. “Amid the 2024 losses of forest cover and forest integrity, restoration efforts reveal both untapped potential and emerging success,” the authors’ write. “Protecting these young secondary forests is as critical as preserving primary and pristine forests.” 🌴🌴🐆🌿🌱🦜🌴🦥\nTropical forest regrowth increased over the last decade news.mongabay.com/...\nNatural forest regrowth in the world’s tropical rainforests is expanding.\nmore than 11 million hectares (27 million acres) of tropical moist forests are under some stage of forest regrowth between 2015 and 2021.\n“We’d rather see that regrowth than not, of course.
