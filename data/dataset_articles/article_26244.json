  "text": "Calling it a step in the right direction to make good on the aggressive renewable energy policy adopted by the government of Guam, Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero signed Bill 135-38 into law Thursday.\nThe measure approves amendments to the Chamorro Land Trust Commission's lease of Dededo land to the Guam International Country Club. It permits the property to be converted from a golf course to a solar farm and requires GICC to make an up-front payment of $9 million once a solar farm deal is signed with the Guam Power Authority.\nThe bill also projects a profit share for the CLTC from the solar business of $1.5 million per year over the next 30 years. \"The amended lease provides clear financial benefits for the people of Guam and has received the unanimous support of the CLTC,\" Leon Guerrero said.\nOpponents of the solar farm conversion, led by a local activist group who call themselves Prutehi Guåhan, staged a protest during last month's legislative session deliberations on the measure.\nAccording to Post files, as senators prepared to discuss Bill 135-38 on the session floor, protesters in the gallery above began to sing the Guam hymn, \"Fanoghe CHamoru.\"\n\"This heartfelt disruption served as a reminder of the obligation of all Guåhan residents, and especially those who are indigenous CHamorus, to protect our island’s resources and to uphold the very spirit in which the Chamorro Land Trust Commission was created to advance,\" group leaders said moments before the vote.\nIn her transmittal letter to the Legislature, the governor wrote that GICC plans to construct a 60 to 65 megawatt state-of-the-art solar farm. \"Under existing energy policy, Guam has committed to achieving 50% renewable energy by 2035 and 100% by 2045. The solar power generated by this new infrastructure is projected to power over 45,000 homes and reduce chemical use related to the golf course,\" Leon Guerrero said.\n\"Finally, well-respected organizations such as the World Health Organization, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and North Carolina State University's Clean Energy Technology Center have found solar energy to be a clean source of power while having minimal impact, if any, on the environment,\" she added.",
