  "text": "Grupo Promerica, a leading financial group in Central America, has reinforced its commitment to sustainable development through a USD 50 million financing agreement with Proparco, a subsidiary of the Agence Française de Développement Group, directed to Banco Promerica Costa Rica. The loan aims to expand support for projects promoting sustainable and green buildings, directly aligning with the group’s corporate sustainability objectives.\nThe financing is structured to support the entire sustainable construction value chain. Forty percent of the funds will be allocated to the construction of buildings certified under the EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) standard, while the remaining 60% will fund mortgages for EDGE-certified properties. This approach ensures comprehensive backing for environmentally efficient and resource-conscious buildings.\nEDGE certification recognizes green buildings that achieve at least a 20% reduction in energy, water, and embodied energy in materials compared to conventional buildings. By promoting the adoption of low-emission construction practices, this initiative contributes to a low-carbon economy and supports sustainable growth in Costa Rica.\nThe partnership advances several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by stimulating the economy, SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) by promoting sustainable urbanization, and SDG 13 (Climate Action) by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nExecutives from Grupo Promerica, Proparco, and Banco Promerica Costa Rica emphasized that this initiative not only supports environmentally responsible construction but also facilitates access to sustainable housing for Costa Rican families. They highlighted the importance of aligning financial growth with social and environmental impact and expressed their commitment to continuing and strengthening sustainable development efforts across the region in the coming years.",
