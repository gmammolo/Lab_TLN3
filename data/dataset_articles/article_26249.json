  "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — In 2016, Norton Audubon Hospital in Louisville invested $18 million to install an ice plant , which has turned into big savings nearly 10 years later.\nWhat You Need To Know Norton Audubon Hospital invested $18 million to install an ice plant in 2016\nTwenty-seven tanks turn roughly 74,000 gallons of water into nearly 52 tons of ice each night\nThe tanks of ice then thaw, with the cool air released to replace air conditioning\nThe thermal energy storage system has saved almost $4 million and significantly reduced emissions since 2016 The hospital has a unique solution in place as demand for electricity grows, using ice to help keep facilities cool and save on energy costs .\nMike Huffines, director of engineering, said 27 tanks turn roughly 74,000 gallons of water into nearly 52 tons of ice each night.\n“From 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., and during those hours, we turn our electric chillers off,\" Huffines said. \"We move completely to ice.\"\nThe tanks of ice then thaw, with cool air released to replace air conditioning. This cools the entire hospital as it tries to move away from fossil fuels.\n“The energy demands of a hospital are huge, and this takes some of that peak demand off,” Huffines said.\nAnthony Mathis, Norton Healthcare's system director for sustainability, said the thermal energy storage system has saved almost $4 million and significantly reduced emissions since 2016.\n“Those dollars can be spent in a lot of other places that need money as well,\" Mathis said.\nMathis said this technology has also helped Audubon become an \"Energy Star\"-certified hospital .\n“It's an awesome feeling because this hospital is being ran as efficiently as most hospitals across the country, and that's a big statement to be able to say,” Mathis said.\nBoth Huffines and Mathis said they hope to see more industries to utilize this type of thermal energy storage technology.\nNorton Audubon Hospital is the largest in the region to utilize thermal energy storage system and looks to add more tanks in the future.\nRelated Stories Buildings are turning to 'ice batteries' for sustainable air conditioning",
