  "text": "The first transit transport from China to Europe via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) has been successfully completed\nThe first transit transport from China to Europe via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) has been successfully completed. The ship, which left the port of Ningbo on 23 September, arrived at the British port of Felixstowe on 13 October, reported the Russian state company Rosatom.\n\"The first container transit from China to Europe has arrived at the British port of Felixstowe,\" the press release states.\nThe journey was an important milestone in developing the NSR as a sustainable logistics corridor between Europe and Asia. As Rosatom noted, the trans-Arctic route allowed for a halving of the time for cargo delivery compared to the traditional southern route through the Suez Canal, which typically takes 30–40 days. The entire journey through the Russian Arctic took 20 days.\nOur channel: @node_of_time_EN",
