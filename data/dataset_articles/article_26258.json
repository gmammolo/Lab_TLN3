The loan will finance the construction of the Alta and Media Valle Trompia inter-municipal aqueduct, serving the municipalities of Bovegno, Pezzaze, Tavernole sul Mella, Marcheno, Gardone Valle Trompia, Sarezzo, Lumezzane and Villa Carcina. It will also support the expansion and upgrading of wastewater treatment plants in Calcinato-Calcinatello, Leno, Poncarale and Mairano. Additionally, throughout the territory currently served by Acque Bresciane, interventions will be carried out to reduce water distribution losses, improve and upgrade facilities, and implement digitalisation and network monitoring.\n“Through these financing operations, our company once again demonstrates its strong commitment to modernising water infrastructure,” said Pierluigi Toscani, Chair of Acque Bresciane srl SB, adding, “These interventions will have a real impact on our local areas, fully aligned with our 2045 Sustainability Plan and our Benefit Company status.”\nSince its founding, Acque Bresciane has significantly increased its investments, growing from approximately €22 million in 2018 to nearly €60 million in 2023.\nFor Intesa Sanpaolo, the transaction was structured by the IMI Corporate & Investment Banking Division, led by Mauro Micillo.\n“The water sector is strategic for achieving the sustainability goals of our communities,” stated Michele Sorrentino, Head of the Italian Network of Intesa Sanpaolo’s IMI CIB Division. “This transaction channels tangible resources into projects that generate real benefits for local areas and people’s well-being. Intesa Sanpaolo thus reaffirms its commitment to supporting companies like Acque Bresciane, which invest in innovation, improved efficiency and digitalisation of networks.”\nAs part of the transaction, legal advisory was provided by Legance – Avvocati Associati (Energy & Infrastructure Department), and technical assistance by Agenia S.r.l.\n***\nAcque Bresciane srl SB\nAcque Bresciane is a fully publicly owned benefit corporation, established in 2017 to manage the Integrated Water Service as an in-house company of the Province of Brescia.
