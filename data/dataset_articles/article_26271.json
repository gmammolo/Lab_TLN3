  "text": "First Nuclear Corp. is the future of clean energy through the innovative use of small modular reactors (SMRs).\nAs part of the First Hydrogen family, First Nuclear aims to produce green hydrogen from SMRs efficiently and sustainably, contributing to global decarbonisation efforts.\nThrough the utilisation of nuclear energy, sustainable green hydrogen is produced, paving the way for the broader initiative of a zero-emission planet.\nCompact and scalable small modular reactors\nFirst Nuclear’s SMRs are compact, scalable, and capable of providing a continuous, weather-independent power supply.\nBy integrating these advanced nuclear technologies, we ensure a stable and cost-effective green hydrogen production process.\nThis approach not only supports the growing demand for clean energy but also aligns with global regulatory and market trends.\nThe hydrogen-as-a-service model\nAs part of the First Hydrogen family, First Nuclear is integrated with the company’s hydrogen-as-a-service (HAAS) model.\nThis system enables the delivery of a seamless energy ecosystem, allowing businesses and communities to transition smoothly to clean energy.\nPartnership with the University of Alberta\nFirst Hydrogen’s partnership with Dr Muhammad Taha Manzoor of the University of Alberta will further propel the development of SMR technology.\nThis strategic initiative aims to optimise reactor fuel materials and design in response to the surging global energy demand driven by artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.\nAI data centres, which consume up to ten times more power than traditional facilities, are reshaping the global energy landscape.\nWith electricity demand from data centres expected to double by 2030 – reaching 945 terawatt-hours according to the International Energy Agency – First Hydrogen’s focus on SMR technology represents a timely and vital solution.\nThe partnership recently expanded to focus on fuel reactor materials, reactor design and reactor design optimisation.",
