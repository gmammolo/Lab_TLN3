  "text": "Rising German and carbon prices pushed Nordic power rates up, but wetter weather and strong hydro reserves are keeping gains in check.\n14 minutes ago • 2 mins\nJoin the newsletter that everyone in finance secretly reads. 1M+ subscribers, 100% free.\nWhat’s going on here?\nNordic power prices edged higher this week, lifted by climbing German electricity and carbon markets, but strong hydro reserves and plenty of wet weather are stopping costs from spiraling.\nWhat does this mean?\nThe Nordic power market is feeling the tug-of-war between rising European prices and robust local supply. On the one hand, pricier German electricity and higher EU carbon costs drove up Nordic futures contracts by 1.6%. But with hydro reservoirs sitting about 3 terawatt hours above average for the next two weeks—and forecasts calling for more rain and mild weather—there’s plenty of supply to soften price pressures. Even as futures ticked up, the physical system price for next-day delivery dropped over 40%, showing just how quickly actual market sentiment can shift as supply builds. LSEG analysts expect the wet conditions to last into November, likely keeping hydro availability strong and tempering volatility for now.\nWhy should I care?\nFor markets: Energy prices in flux.\nThis week’s 1.6% rise in Nordic futures lines up with gains across European power and carbon markets, reflecting cross-border influences on regional electricity costs. Yet, the Nordics saw next-day delivery prices plunge by 40%, underlining how quickly prices can adjust when hydro supply is flush. Gas prices in the UK and Netherlands also edged up, showing just how interconnected energy markets have become—what happens in one country or sector now ripples through the rest.\nThe bigger picture: Hydro puts a cap on volatility.\nThe Nordics’ hydro surplus—hovering well above seasonal averages—acts as a cushion against Europe’s broader upswing in power and carbon costs, showing the resilience of renewables in shaping local markets. The EU’s carbon trading scheme keeps fossil fuel costs climbing, nudging more regions toward hydro and other renewables. If the current wet weather holds, the region’s dependence on water power could keep price swings in check, even as Europe’s energy landscape stays volatile.\nTrading is hard enough as it is, so you need tools that make investing simpler.\nAfter all, if you’re switching platforms to track data trends, do deeper research, and make trades, you’re using extra time and effort. Plus, those delays could make you miss an opportunity.\nTradu’s TradingView gets rid of that clutter: you’ll find institutional-grade charts, technical analysis, and trend-marking tools in the same platform – and, you can execute trades right there and then.\nYou know what they say: tidy desk, tidy mind… Tidy portfolio.\n65% of retail CFD accounts lose money.
