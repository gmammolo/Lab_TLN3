  "text": "Gas Line Strike Shuts Down Camp Jordan Parkway\nEmergency crews temporarily closed Camp Jordan Parkway Monday afternoon after a gas line was struck during construction near the park’s restaurant area.\nThe incident happened just before 2 p.m., when a tractor hit the line and the operator immediately called 911. The call came in at 1:54 p.m., and crews arrived on scene within minutes.\n“We had a strong odor of gas, immediately started evacuating nearby businesses, and notified the gas company,” said Mike Williams, Fire Chief for the City of East Ridge.\nAs a precaution, businesses in the area were evacuated and the road was shut down while crews secured the scene. The situation was resolved without incident.\nThe road has since reopened, and officials say the area is now safe.",
