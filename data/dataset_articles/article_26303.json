  "text": "Kenya Airways is taking a pioneering role in sustainable aviation by leading the charge for greener air travel across Africa. The airline is testing locally produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of its flights. With an ambitious goal to integrate sustainable fuel solutions into its operations, Kenya Airways is not only contributing to global carbon reduction efforts but also aiming to create a cost-effective, locally sourced alternative to traditional jet fuel. This move aligns with the airline’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and supports the wider aviation industry’s shift toward more sustainable practices. By tapping into Africa’s vast agricultural resources, Kenya Airways is setting the stage for a new era in African aviation—one that combines economic viability with environmental responsibility.\nKenya Airways Plc is making a bold move to showcase that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be produced and used in Africa, proving that the continent can contribute to the growing global demand for green aviation fuels. Advertisement The Nairobi-based airline has taken a significant step by operating four return flights between October 14 and 21, each using a blend of SAF, in an effort to explore the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally. This is a part of the airline’s strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and to find a cost-effective alternative to traditional jet fuel.\nThe first flight in this trial took off from Nairobi to Paris on Tuesday. This flight was part of a broader shift in Europe, where new regulations require at least 2% SAF to be included in all departing flights. For this journey, Kenya Airways combined conventional jet fuel with biofuel derived from drought-resistant crops like croton, which are grown in Kenya. The biofuel is a key element of the airline’s attempt to test locally sourced fuel and determine its performance on long-haul flights.\nKenya Airways had already made history in 2023 when it became the first African airline to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight. That flight used biofuel from an international supplier, Italy’s Eni SpA, which signified a major milestone in the airline’s sustainability journey. However, the airline is now keen to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers and focus on producing SAF locally, which could be more sustainable and cost-effective for the region.\nThe challenge with SAF, however, lies in its cost. While SAF is an important tool in reducing aviation’s carbon emissions, it comes at a price. SAF costs up to twice as much as conventional jet fuel, and for African carriers, it can cost up to five times more due to the complexities of logistics and the lack of a local supply chain. This financial burden is a significant hurdle for African airlines, as the cost of SAF can impact ticket prices and make the fuel less appealing to both airlines and passengers. Advertisement Kenya Airways is addressing this challenge head-on by looking into ways to reduce SAF production costs, aiming to find solutions that can make the fuel more affordable in the long run. The airline also hopes to attract subsidies from governments and international organizations to support the production and use of SAF. The airline’s CEO has emphasized that African passengers are not yet willing to pay extra for flights that use SAF, which adds a layer of complexity to the airline’s strategy.\nTo expand its SAF-powered operations, Kenya Airways plans to introduce SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to other major global destinations, including Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. While European airports will provide SAF refueling services for these flights, the return flight to Cape Town will be powered by conventional fuel. The airline intends to initially incorporate 2% SAF into its fleet and gradually increase this percentage to 10% by 2030. This ambitious goal aligns with Kenya Airways’ long-term sustainability plans, which aim to reduce the airline’s environmental impact and encourage the adoption of green fuels in Africa.\nLocal SAF production could also offer additional benefits beyond cost reduction. It could provide an opportunity for Kenyan airlines to meet future regulatory requirements as governments and international bodies push for greener fuel options in aviation. In addition, the development of a local SAF supply chain could open up financing opportunities from both African lenders and international climate funds. This financing could be critical in helping Kenya Airways and other African carriers scale up their SAF use and remain competitive as sustainability becomes increasingly important in global aviation.\nKenya Airways has partnered with Bleriot Group, a company that produces the biofuel used in the airline’s demonstration flights. Bleriot Group holds a 15-year lease on 6,000 acres of land that was previously mined by a major mining company. The land, which is not suitable for food crops, is now being used to cultivate plants for biofuel production. This sustainable land use provides a viable alternative to traditional agricultural activities and is an example of how Kenya can leverage its natural resources for green energy production.\nBleriot Group’s efforts to use this land for biofuel production highlight the potential for sustainable agriculture to play a significant role in the growth of Africa’s green economy. By using drought-resistant crops to produce biofuels, the initiative not only contributes to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint but also supports local agriculture and rural economies.\nThis partnership between Kenya Airways and Bleriot Group represents a promising step in the future of sustainable aviation in Africa. As the airline continues to test the viability of locally sourced SAF and increase its green fuel usage, Kenya Airways hopes to serve as a model for other airlines across the continent. With the potential for cost reductions, increased financing opportunities, and a stronger local economy, the airline’s commitment to SAF could ultimately make it a pioneer in Africa’s sustainable aviation industry.\nKenya Airways is leading Africa’s sustainable aviation movement by pioneering the use of locally produced sustainable aviation fuel. This initiative aims to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of air travel, setting a new standard for green aviation in the region.\nThe results of these demonstration flights will provide valuable data that could help shape the future of SAF production and usage in Africa. If successful, this initiative could open the door to a broader adoption of SAF across the African aviation sector, helping the industry meet its carbon reduction targets and contribute to the global fight against climate change. The journey of Kenya Airways towards a more sustainable future is just beginning, but the steps taken so far show promise for both the airline and the region’s aviation industry. Advertisement",
