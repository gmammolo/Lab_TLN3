The Government received over 9,400 submissions which indicated strong support for reducing the impacts of single-use plastics through a range of approaches, including bans, product design, waste infrastructure, and widespread education.\nOn 13 June 2021 the State Government announced it was fast-tracking Western Australia’s Plan for Plastics.\nThe fast-tracked Plan for Plastics includes:\nInput on the Stage 1 ban was sought via information sessions in August 2021 and an advisory group consisting of environmental, community, and industry stakeholders.\nThe Stage 1 ban commenced 1 January 2022 with bans on supply enforceable by 1 July 2022 (and 1 October 2022 for cold cups).\nThe Stage 2 ban commenced 1 January 2023. The Stage 2 ban includes disposable plastic items such as: produce bags, coffee cups, lids for food and drink containers, polystyrene packaging, microbeads, cotton bud sticks, and oxo-degradable additives. Opportunities to provide input and feedback on Stage 2 were provided in 2022.\nThe WA Government is implementing strategies to reduce the impacts of single-use plastics, including bans on problematic plastic items.\nFrom 1 July 2022 WA businesses can no longer supply:\nFrom 1 October 2022 WA businesss can no longer supply disposable plastic cups for cold drinks.\nThe ban applies to:\nThe ban does not apply to:\nBalloon releases were also banned from 1 July 2022, however balloons are not banned.\nFines of $5,000 per offence apply.\nReusable cups, plates and cutlery, reusable containers for takeaway food, reusable straws (e.g., silicon, metal), reusable shopping and fresh produce bags, and reusable party decorations (e.g., bunting).
