As part of the partnership, students from the Communication and Media Studies Department will be offered unpaid internships at PHA Sargodha, lasting between three to six months. Interns will receive certificates of appreciation recognizing their contributions.\nDr Shah commended Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Qaiser Abbas for his continued commitment to community development and environmental stewardship.\nHe also highlighted the University’s role in the Punjab Government’s Citrus Revival Program, which distributes disease-free citrus plants to farmers. Under this initiative, university scientists are offering field support and technical assistance to improve citrus cultivation in the region.\nTo further support the partnership, the University’s campus TV and radio stations will broadcast PHA’s public service messages and educational content focused on horticulture, environmental protection, and community participation in beautification efforts and local festivals.\nThe collaboration also includes joint plantation drives and awareness sessions to foster environmental responsibility and civic involvement among students and the wider community.",
