  "text": "FSC has joined 100+ NGOs supporting the #Together4Forests movement.\nFSC Latin America is gaining ground: Government partnerships to scale sustainable forest management\nGeneral news\nIn Latin America, a powerful transformation is underway. FSC Latin America is forging meaningful partnerships with governments across the region, turning sustainable forest management from an aspiration into a shared priority. This reflects a transition from government engagement to true government partnering, where collaboration goes beyond dialogue to a shared agenda for action.\nOn 14 September at Expo Madera 2025, FSC Latin America signed a cooperation agreement with Paraguay’s National Forestry Institute (INFONA) – the first of its kind in the region. This government-level agreement commits both organizations to strengthen institutional cooperation, improve forest product traceability, ensure access to international markets with high environmental and social standards, and promote sustainable forest management. It sets a new precedent for how public-private collaboration can accelerate environmental impact at scale.\nCristina Goralewski, President of INFONA, puts it clearly: “This agreement strengthens the national forest policy and consolidates Paraguay’s commitment to sustainability, opening new opportunities for the forestry sector to become a true driver of economic, social, and environmental development.”\nYet, Paraguay is just the beginning. FSC Latin America also partnered with SERNANP in Peru. Their shared goal is to certify over 8 million hectares of protected natural areas in the country. This collaboration was officially sealed with the signing of an agreement between SERNANP and FSC. As part of this effort, workshops were conducted to support self-assessment under FSC’s Forest Management Standard using the Continuous Improvement Procedure. “This is an important opportunity for SERNANP. With FSC, we can showcase, together, the improvements in our system,” says Luis Alfaro, Coordinator of the Natural Heritage of Peru Initiative. These efforts are strengthening national capacities and promoting adaptive management, ensuring policies respond to local realities.\nThese alliances are transforming how FSC Latin America works with governments at the national level and have the potential to open doors to global policy spaces such as the COP 30, where stronger public-private collaboration can amplify regional voices on sustainability.\n“These actions mark a pivotal step in strengthening sustainable forest management in the region,” says Bruno Rath, FSC’s Regional Director for Latin America. “For FSC Latin America, building strong alliances with governments and local stakeholders is key to ensuring long-term sustainability and amplifying impact. We are confident these joint efforts will set a positive precedent for Paraguay, for Peru, and will inspire other countries in the region.”\nThrough these agreements, FSC Latin America shows that real change comes from deep commitment from the forest floor to the halls of government – creating benefits that resonate across communities, ecosystems, and economies. When governments partner with civil society and experts, sustainability becomes more than a goal: it becomes reality.",
