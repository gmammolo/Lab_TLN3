  "text": "Next Article\nParis climate goals could reduce extreme heat days: Study\nA fresh study finds that if countries meet their Paris Agreement climate pledges, India could see 30 fewer extremely hot days every year—compared to a future where global warming hits 4°C.\nGlobally, this kind of action could mean 57 fewer scorching days annually.\nCurrent warming and future risks\nSince 2015, the world's temperature has climbed by 0.3°C, adding about 11 extra hot days each year worldwide.\nIndia and Pakistan have seen heatwaves become two times more likely.\nIf warming reaches 4°C, the world could be looking at a whopping 114 hot days per year.\nRegional breaks and global challenges\nThe study points out that some places would get bigger breaks than others: Kenya might avoid up to 82 hot days a year, while Mexico could skip 77.\nBut even if we keep warming to around 2.6°C, extreme heat events would still be way more common—up to 35 times more likely than today.\nUrgent call for action\nResearchers found that climate change made all of the world's major heatwaves worse.\nThey warn current efforts aren't enough and urge richer countries to speed up fossil fuel cuts and invest in better protections for vulnerable communities.\nRoadmap for change\nThe Paris Agreement gives us a roadmap, but experts say stronger action is needed—like faster policy changes and better early warning systems—to protect health and livelihoods as extreme heat becomes the new normal.",
