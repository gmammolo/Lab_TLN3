  "text": "For the past three years, the Love Blue Inc. chapter at Florida Gulf Coast University has been a significant part of Lee County beach cleanup efforts.\nLove Blue Inc. is a national nonprofit organization that focuses on ocean and shoreline conservation. The nonprofit includes school clubs and community chapters across the country.\nMichaela Zimmerman, president of the local club, encourages students to come out to the beach cleanups to make a difference within the community.\nRecently, the club hosted its third cleanup out of the nine that are planned for this semester. Forty pounds of trash were collected by 40 members.\nAccording to the club’s Instagram account, in the spring 2025 semester, FGCU students turned up to various beaches and collected 2,138 pounds of trash total.\nWGCU is your trusted source for news and information in Southwest Florida. We are a nonprofit public service, and your support is more critical than ever. Keep public media strong and donate now. Thank you.",
