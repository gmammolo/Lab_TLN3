Sifuentes lived in El Paso with their three children.\nRaygoza would come to El Paso on the weekend to visit his family.\nInvestigators stated in the arrest affidavit that Sifuentes was having an affair with another man for two years.\nAccording to the arrest affidavit, Raygoza found out about the affair on March 28.\nRELATED: El Paso man arrested for murder, accused of dumping woman's body in Ciudad Juarez\nThe document stated that Sifuentes and the other man rented a hotel together. Raygoza called his wife through a video call but she did not answer.\nRaygoza then sent his wife a text with a photo of her vehicle in the parking lot of the hotel while she was with the other man.\nThe document stated that cameras showed Raygoza crossing into Juarez through the Ysleta Port of Entry on March 21 driving his wife's vehicle. Cameras showed Raygoza returning to the US that day in the same vehicle, but the vehicle looked dirty like it had been driven in the terrain.\nSifuente's body was found on the roadway near Mirador Camino Real about 23 miles from the port of entry.\nInvestigators obtained screenshots of Raygoza's search history and found he searched Juarez news articles.\nOnce arrested, Raygoza told authorities he returned to El Paso on March 21 but initially didn't tell them he knew his wife was cheating on him.
