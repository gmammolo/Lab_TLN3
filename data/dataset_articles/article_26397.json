  "text": "DUBLIN, Ireland, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fusion Fuel Green PLC (Nasdaq: HTOO) (“Fusion Fuel” or the “Company”), a leading provider of full-service energy engineering, advisory, and utility solutions, today announced that it has signed a Subscription and Shareholders Agreement (the “Joint Venture Agreement”) with Alien Fuel (Proprietary) Limited (“Alien Fuel”) to formally establish their joint venture vehicle, Biosteam Energy Proprietary Ltd (“Biosteam Energy”), for the Fairfield Industrial Decarbonization Project (the “Fairfield Project”) in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.\nUnder the joint venture structure, Fusion Fuel will hold a 51% ownership stake in Biosteam Energy, with Alien Fuel retaining 49%. Under the terms of the Fairfield Project and the Joint Venture Agreement, Biosteam Energy will manage the financing, construction, and operation of a biomass-powered steam generation system to replace the fossil-fuel-based boiler at Fairfield Dairy, one of South Africa’s largest dairy processing facilities. The new boiler system, designed and operated using Alien Fuel’s proprietary biomass technology, will use carbon-neutral wood pellets produced from waste biomass, designed to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions at the site. The system is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2026 and significantly supports the decarbonization and sustainability goals of Fairfield Dairy.\nFusion Fuel will advance a loan of R10 million (approximately €480,000) under a payment schedule to fund the management and administration of Biosteam Energy, and specifically the Fairfield Project. Biosteam Energy is expected to generate long term recurring revenues through a steam supply agreement between Biosteam Energy and Fairfield Dairy, as well as additional income from verified carbon credit revenues arising from landfill avoidance and fuel-switching benefits. The loan will be repaid based on the availability of free cash flow after certain expenses and accumulated cash balances.\nLesen Sie auch -30 % Ø-Kursziel Nach 257 % Kursanstieg: Droht dieser Aktie JETZT der Horror-Crash? gestern 10:00 Grüner Strom überholt Kohle Warum Erneuerbare-Energie-Aktien trotz Trump wieder im Kommen sind 12.10.25, 17:00 Analyst enthüllt Krypto-Treasury-Firmen – die \"Berkshire Hathaways\" der Blockchain 03.10.25, 16:00 Kurs erreicht Höchststand Rekordhoch: Diese Aktie überrascht alle! vor 16 Minuten In addition to the initial Fairfield Project, the Joint Venture Agreement also grants Fusion Fuel a right of first refusal to participate in new projects, business opportunities, or ventures within the scope of Biosteam Energy’s business that have been offered to Alien Energy or certain of its affiliates, with a particular interest in the green and sustainable energy projects such as this first bio-steam venture.\nSeite 1 von 4 Seite 2 ►",
