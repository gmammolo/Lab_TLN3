  "text": "RENO, Nev. (News 4-Fox 11) — A Washoe County judge set bail at $10 million cash only for the Cold Springs father charged in connection to the death of his 5-year-old daughter.\nNicholas Loving, 35, is currently in custody at the Washoe County jail where he faces one count of child abuse causing substantially bodily harm after Izabella Loving was found dead in their home on April 3.\nJudge Kendra Bertschy said during a court hearing Wednesday afternoon that state law prohibits a no-bail hold for his current charges.\nLoving was scheduled to appear virtually from the jail, but he was never seen during the minutes-long court hearing as his court-appointed public defender and legal counsel for the state sorted out the specifics before the judge.\nIf Loving is able to post the $10 million bail, there will be a number of stipulations including home confinement, ankle monitor system, a no contact order with his four kids who are currently in Child Protective Services custody and his wife Andrea Loving.\nDeputies with the Washoe County Sheriff's Office were called to a home on the 17000 block of Crystal Canyon Blvd. before 7 a.m. on April 3 on the report of girl who had no pulse, was cold to touch and had been sick the night before.\nAccording to the probable cause document, authorities arrived on scene and found the young girl unresponsive in a bedroom upstairs lying next to a 'tiny mattress with no bed frame.' Emergency responders immediately noticed 'a lot of signs of trauma' and further described the girl as having oral trauma, apparent bruising on her face, pelvis, hips, the insides of her biceps and on her genitals, according to the documents.\nDeputies on scene also confirmed multiple apparent bruises, cuts, scabs and scrapes to the girl's arms, legs, torso and face, including a black eye and a gash over her other eye. The documents reveal the girl was suffering from more than 10 injuries easily seen on her face alone.\nBoth Andrea and Nicholas Loving told police their daughter Izabella was sick the night of her death, but they said they checked on her in the middle of the night saying she was 'OK,' and everyone went back to bed.\nWhen police confronted the parents about not taking their daughter to the doctor sooner, they said they didn't want the doctors to see her injuries and they were previously advised not to seek medical attention until at least 12 days after falling ill.\nDocuments say Nicholas checked on the daughter once more in the middle of the night before waking up the next morning to find his daughter not breathing and cold to the touch. Both parents pointed to a recent Child Protective Services case against them saying it was closed, and they were concerned police on scene might call CPS for this.\nWhile interviewing the parents, Andrea told authorities Nick wanted to bury Izabella's body in the backyard and take a trip to his parents house in Virginia.\nOver the course of the investigation and interviews with family members, detectives had enough evidence to charge the 35-year-old father with one count of child abuse causing substantial bodily harm.\nThe documents outline how Nicholas was re-interviewed and confronted with some of the allegations shared by his family members and he blamed the decision on not calling 911 at 2 a.m. on Andrea saying it was her idea to run.\nAndrea disputed Nicholas by telling the authorities he wanted to bury the body in the backyard and 'run' to his parents’ house in Virginia. The mother disagreed, saying they couldn't do that because the body would 'rot,' according to the documents.\nPolice noticed abrasions on Loving's hands and fingers, but he blamed the injuries on work.\nCourt documents obtained by News 4-Fox 11 just hours before the bail hearing revealed Loving was convicted of the exact same charge in 2014.\nAccording to those documents, Loving was initially charged with 2 counts of child abuse and one count of domestic battery stemming from an incident involving his then-girlfriend's 2-year-old son.\nHe pleaded guilty to one count of child abuse causing substantial bodily harm and ultimately served 60 months probation.\nNow, he is again charged with one count of child abuse/neglect resulting in substantial bodily harm in the death of 5-year-old Izebella Loving.\nAccording to Reno Police records filed in the 2014 case, Loving told police he bit the 2-year-old boy on the right shoulder, 'leaving distinct teeth patterns on the child's right shoulder,' because he was rambunctious after a bath. He also admitted to pulling the child up by the arm, which 'most likely caused (a) spiral fracture.'\nLoving told police that he 'did not mean to harm the child, but agreed the child had the broken arm because he lost his temper.'\nWashoe County Judge Elliott Sattler technically sentenced Loving to a prison term up to 96 months, but Sattler suspended the prison sentence and sentenced him to 5 years of probation.\nThat means Loving would've automatically served that prison time had he violated the terms of his probation, but he did not violate his probation and ultimately did not do any prison time for the child abuse conviction.\nThe lighter sentence came after Loving's attorney argued for leniency, saying that he felt genuinely remorseful, was gainfully employed and a good support system.\nDistrict Attorney Chris Hicks expressed deep sorrow over the death of 5-year-old Izabella Loving and emphasized the importance of a comprehensive investigation to ensure justice.\n\"Like so many in our community, my office was heartbroken to hear of this child’s death and the terrible injuries she suffered,\" Hicks said. \"A complete and thorough investigation is critical to pursuing justice for this victim and it is our highest priority.\"\nHicks stated that his office's most experienced prosecutors are collaborating closely with Sheriff's Office detectives as they finalize their investigation. Once completed, the District Attorney’s Office will meticulously review the evidence to ensure all legally viable charges are pursued.\nHe noted that initial charges in a case can be amended or added later, depending on further investigation, advanced forensic testing, or expert reviews, particularly in cases involving a death.",
