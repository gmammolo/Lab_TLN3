  "text": "Strong leadership from government, housebuilders, insurers and flood action groups will be vital in ensuring homes across England are better protected from the impacts of flooding, according to an independent review published today (Thursday 16 October).\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the use of property flood resilience measures, which help reduce the risk of damage to individual properties, speed up recovery and help people go back home after flooding. However, uptake remains still too low.\nWith the latest Environment Agency data showing more than 6.3 million properties in England are now at risk of flooding, it’s vital that more homeowners explore these measures to avoid facing higher insurance premiums or reduced market value for their property.\nCommissioned by the Environment Agency, Professor Peter Bonfield has published an independent review setting out how the nation can accelerate practical and affordable flood resilience measures for homes, while offering a clear roadmap for boosting resilience and helping people recover faster from floods.\nProperty flood resilience measures – such as flood doors, non-return valves and air bricks – can help to keep as much water out of a property as possible. They also include measures like tiled floors and raised electrics, so if water does enter, it minimises damage and helps people get back on their feet quicker. The use of Sustainable Drainage Systems at property level, for example permeable paving and rain gardens, can also reduce the risk of surface water flooding.\nThe FloodReady Review builds on progress made since the 2016 PFR Review and sets out a series of clear, practical recommendations to increase the use of resilience measures in homes and businesses at risk of flooding.\nRecommendations include investment being targeted to areas where PFR measures offer the greatest benefit and best value for money. It also calls on landlords to help protect their tenants by embedding PFR into housing improvements.\nIt also advocates for greater collaboration between local authorities and water companies to align investment plans and deliver resilience more effectively. These recommendations represent a forward-looking approach to tackling the growing challenge of flooding in a changing climate.\nProfessor Peter Bonfield, lead for the Flood Ready Review, said: Flooding presents a significant and growing risk to people, properties and businesses. I was pleased to be invited to lead this independent review – FloodReady – of how we can better mainstream property flood resilience.\nFloodReady sets out how we can make flood resilience a normal part of how homes and businesses are built, maintained and repaired. It shows the power of partnership working between government, insurers, local authorities, and communities.\nIt is really heartening that the actions set out in FloodReady will now progress for delivery through the multi-sectoral Leadership Group, Property Flood Resilience Roundtable and others to make the actions a reality to help protect people and property.\nJulie Foley, Director of Flood Risk Strategy at the Environment Agency, said: We have been actively working with suppliers and partners to mainstream property flood resilience as one of the ways of tackling the rising threat of flooding.\nThrough our new flood investment programme, we will be targeting property flood resilience measures where they are the most effective way of managing flood risk and offer the best value for money.\nWe are also committed to ensuring that the suppliers and installers we work with follow industry best practice so that we can build trust with communities and ensure that property flood resilience can play in helping people recover more quickly after flooding.\nFloods Minister Emma Hardy said: As we experience the effects of climate change it has never been more important to mainstream Property Flood Resilience measures.\nToday’s FloodReady review marks a vital step change in how people better protect their homes and recover faster after flooding.\nI look forward to working across government and with partners to build resilience and safeguard communities as we face a future of increasing flood risk.\nThe Review is the result of close collaboration between the Environment Agency, Defra, Flood Re, the insurance sector, housing associations, builders, local authorities, and community groups. This joint effort aims to align flood resilience actions with the government’s Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy and wider climate adaptation goals.\nThe recommendations will be taken forward by a core leadership group, who will work closely with stakeholders to prioritise and implement key actions.\nABI Director General Hannah Gurga said: With climate change increasing the frequency and severity of flooding, we strongly support the FloodReady Review’s focus on coordinated action to protect homes and communities. The review shows the impact of the whole supply chain working together to improve our resilience to flooding, and insurers are committed to increasing the uptake of Build Back Better and Property Flood Resilience. This is a vital opportunity to make sure flood resilience is built into our homes, with clear standards, accessible funding, and strong collaboration across sectors.\nCharles Roe, Director of Mortgages at UK Finance, said: UK Finance welcomes the FloodReady Review and the recommendations it sets out for tackling one of the most visible climate-related challenges facing households and communities. Flood risk is not just an environmental issue, it has direct implications for mortgage lending, insurance, and property valuation. The mortgage sector is committed to working with government, insurers, and homeowners to ensure investment in property flood resilience initiatives. This Review is an important step towards building a system where property flood risk is better understood, managed, and mitigated.\nPaul Shaffer, Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) said: CIWEM has been working with many of the contributors to the FloodReady review to build a pathway for PFR professionals to be trained, assessed and professionally registered in order to quality assure and demonstrate their competence. We believe that FloodReady’s recommendations to focus on skill development, sector consolidation and alignment is vital to increasing the resilience and confidence of communities at risk of flooding. We look forward to working with government and other FloodReady partners to provide the necessary consistency and confidence in PFR delivery.\nBrett Amphlett, Policy & Public Affairs: The Builders Merchants’ Federation, said: The misery that flooding causes is inevitably local - and therefore the response must be local - from flood risk managers, builders’ merchants and others. Local merchants can provide what’s needed for immediate relief - followed by pumps, dryers, dehumidifiers and other materials & products in the resulting clear-up. The Builders Merchants’ Federation supports this Review and is promoting it to builders’ merchants and civils & drainage specialists in our supply chain - especially in districts prone to flooding.\nAlistair Smyth, Director of Policy and Research, National Housing Federation, said: We welcome the publication of the FloodReady action plan. Improving the resilience of homes to flood risk and reducing the potential impact of flooding on people’s lives will become even more urgent in the years and decades to come. That is why the report’s recommendations on the action needed and the shared responsibilities of landlords and other parties is of vital importance and in time should be adopted right across our sector.\nDuncan King, Senior Technical Manager, Construction Products Association, said: FloodReady highlights the necessity for a whole industry involvement to effectively negate the misery caused by properties being flooded. While standards can be written covering the production of effective flood resilient products, standards of workmanship for those undertaking retrofitting work need to be officially recognised and supported by warranties backed by the insurance industry, perhaps even the introduction of annual inspections of installed measures by local authorities.\nGraham Watts OBE, Chief Executive, Construction Industry Council, said: It has been an eye-opening pleasure to serve on Peter Bonfield’s leadership group for this review, especially as someone who lives in a flood-threatened community. The recommendations in the FloodReady report are wide-ranging and significant. The board of the Construction Industry Council has already pledged support for helping to implement those that are directed at the construction industry.",
