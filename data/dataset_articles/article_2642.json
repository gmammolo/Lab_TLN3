  "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. — The North Carolina Supreme Court's 2024 election took another turn on Monday, with that court temporarily blocking a lower court decision that could invalidate over 60,000 ballots.\nOn Monday, the NC Supreme Court issued a temporary stay on a North Carolina Court of Appeals order that said the contested ballots needed to be reverified or thrown out.\nOn Friday, a state appeals court panel ruled 2-1 along party lines to favor of Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin against incumbent Allison Riggs.\nFor months, Griffin has been contesting the validity of around 60,000 North Carolina ballots cast during the November elections. He's largely targeting some mail-in and early voters, claiming incomplete registrations. However, others have pointed to a database issue.\nFriday's decision would require affected voters to verify their identity and registration. County election boards will identify these voters, giving them 15 business days from the mailing of the notice to respond. Voters who do not comply will have their ballots thrown out, only for this particular race.\nThe Monday order does not rule in favor of either side but allows the appeal from Riggs and the election board to follow through.\nAfter two recounts, Justice Riggs holds a 734-vote lead over Griffin. A majority of those challenged are Democrats, meaning if not enough ballots are verified, this decision could flip the seat back into GOP control. The State Supreme Court currently has a 5-2 Republican majority.\nRiggs has said her campaign would appeal the ruling, releasing a statement that says:\n“We will be promptly appealing this deeply misinformed decision that threatens to disenfranchise more than 65,000 lawful voters and sets a dangerous precedent, allowing disappointed politicians to thwart the will of the people. North Carolinians elected me to keep my seat and I swore an oath to the constitution and the rule of law — so I will continue to stand up for the rights of voters in this state and stand in the way of those who would take power from the people.”\nThis would likely bring the case before the state Supreme Court, the very bench with a seat on the line in the dispute. If the state Supreme Court hears the case, Riggs will recuse herself, leaving a 5-1 Republican majority to decide the matter.\nHowever, this could push a decision back for months. WCNC Charlotte spoke with former NC Supreme Court Justice Bob Orr about next steps. He says a decision from the State Supreme Court could take weeks or months.\n\"It has to be an incredibly uncomfortable position for the for both courts,\" Orr said. \"I think it tends to undermine public confidence in the judiciary and the independence of it.\"\nIf it doesn't go in Riggs's favor, her lawyers have indicated they are likely to appeal, sending it into federal court. This would start the process over again, in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. There's potential for it to go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, but he said it's unlikely given how few cases they take on per year.\n\"It really is complicated. There's so many different paths that this can go down,\" Orr said. \"There's no, no time limit at this point.\"\nHe also mentioned some have floated the possibility of another election, further complicating the future.\n\"Do you have a new election in conjunction with the primaries in 2026?\" Orr said. \"We can all already See the kind of negative ads that are going to be put out there, many by independent groups or party groups. It just continues to tarnish and damage the judiciary.\"\nRegardless, he encourages all voters on this list to take the time to verify their registration now.\nThe months-long back and forth has led to statewide protests and pushback from other legal experts, including a letter from a coalition of over 200 North Carolina jurists, government officials and attorneys urging Griffin to concede.\n\"The arguments you have advanced ask our judicial system to change the rules in place for the 2024 election after it has run its course. Indeed, if you succeed, tens of thousands of voters will lose their voice after they voted,” the letter states. “For the sake of our judicial system, we ask you to terminate your litigation now.”\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court election remains the only undecided race nationally from the 2024 general election.\nContact Julie Kay at juliekay@wcnc.com and follow her on Facebook, X and Instagram.",
