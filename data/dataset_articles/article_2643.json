  "text": "A Rocherlea man grabbed two firearms from his car as he tried to run from police after an evade police incident, the Launceston Magistrates Court heard.\nDamien Michael Milburn, 34, pleaded guilty to a raft of driving, firearms and family violence charges committed early this year.\nPolice prosecutor Dee Wadley said that on March 30, 2025, Milburn was driving a black Holden Commodore on Lilydale Rd.\nThe vehicle's number plate did not match that of a black car, but a Ford Territory, so they attempted to intercept it.\n\"The defendant refused to pull over and increased his speed,\" she said.\nHe stopped at an address in King Billy Crescent and jumped a fence. She said he had two firearms.\n\"As he was running away, he dropped a firearm, and he threw one into 7 King Billy Crescent,\" she said.\nPolice caught him, but he resisted arrest, later telling police he did not want to be arrested.\nA search located 38 grams of methamphetamine, two snaplock bags of methylamphetamine powder and crystal (ice), a snaplock bag of suboxone and a Gerber knife.\n\"The firearms thrown into 7 King Billy Crescent had a round in the chamber,\" she said.\nMilburn told police he had painted the car black.\nThe court heard that a ballistics report would show whether the firearms were in working order.\nMilburn was a disqualified driver and the subject of a firearms prohibition order at the time.\nOn January 31, police intercepted him when he had 27 grams of cannabis bud in his possession.\nMs Wadley told magistrate Sharon Cure that Milburn had breached a five month suspended jail term with the offences.\nThe court heard that Milburn had been given the benefit of drug treatment orders in 2013 and 2017, which allowed him to avoid jail.\nDefence lawyer Mark Doyle said Milburn had previously had a defeatist attitude to the orders and believed he could not extract himself from the drug lifestyle because everyone knew he was involved in drugs.\nHe said there were signs Milburn was ready to change.\nMs Cure said he had spent an awful lot of time in custody.\n\"It's just a sad waste of a life, at 34 years of age, he has just been in and out of jail,\" she said.\nMs Cure said that Milburn would probably have to serve the five-month suspended sentence and ordered that he be assessed for a drug treatment order.\nHe was remanded in custody to reappear for sentence on May 1, at 2.15 pm.\nMs Cure said he was a \"walk-up start\" to be declared a serial family violence offender.",
