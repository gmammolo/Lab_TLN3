  "text": "Mobile phone apps can encourage healthier and more sustainable diets, research finds\n- 15 October 2025\n- 3 min read\nHealth apps play a key role in increasing fruit and vegetable consumption and reducing meat consumption, bringing us closer to diets low in greenhouse gas emissions, the first study of its kind reveals.\nExperts say the findings shed light on how smartphone apps can help us shift towards more sustainable and healthier diets.\nResearchers at the NIHR School for Public Health Research (SPHR) led the study. The team are based at London School for Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).\nImproving health and reducing emissions\nThe global food system accounts for 1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions. These are mostly driven by the production, processing, and consumption of animal-sourced foods. Meanwhile, poor diets are a leading cause of obesity. This is a serious global public health challenge with high economic and social costs.\nDiets in high-income countries (HICs) often contain low amounts of fruit, vegetables, and legumes. Many people in HICs eat above the recommended levels of meat, and foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. Transitioning to healthier alternatives can reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions and improving public health.\nGlobally there are an estimated 350,000 nutrition or fitness apps. Features include diet and weight trackers, barcode scanners, and recipe builders. Previous research has found apps can promote healthier eating. But this study was the first of its kind evaluating sustainability and dietary behaviour change too.\nHarnessing mobile phone apps\nThe researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. They screened 7,356 records, analysing 21 in more detail. The studies involved 12,898 participants across 10 countries and territories.\nThe team found apps promoted increased consumption of fruit and vegetables and a decrease in meat. Message-based content such as notifications and message boards often boosted this. Apps encouraging less meat consumption (compared to generic ones) were most effective for meat reduction.\nThe apps were often used by people who weren’t meeting dietary guidelines, suggesting they could reduce health inequalities. This is unlike fitness apps usually used by already healthy, active people. But markers of inequality were not always reported, which researchers say should be addressed in future work.\nThe level of drop-out was not as high as predicted. 80% of study participants continued to use the apps on average. Although there was limited research over the long-term, with the average study lasting 12 weeks.\nMost of the apps were designed exclusively by researchers or co-developed by researchers, practitioners, and industry. Only 3 were commercial apps: MyFitnessPal, Lose It! and the NHS Weight Loss Plan app.\nFirst author on the study Esther Curtin from NIHR SPHR, said: “The diet and nutrition app industry is huge and evolving all the time – about 1 in 5 people in the UK use apps related to nutrition and fitness – presenting a major untapped opportunity for interventions.\n“Given the widespread uptake of these apps and typical baseline diets of adults in HICs, carefully designed mobile apps could help bring diets closer to the recommended intake of fruit and vegetables, and reduce dietary greenhouse gas emissions.\n“The new EAT-Lancet Commission on healthy, sustainable and just food systems found that shifting diets could prevent up to 15 million premature deaths per year, partly through changes in the consumption of foods such as fruit, vegetables, meat, legumes, and dairy, all of which were captured in our study.\n“Future independent evaluations of commercial apps such as those that promote general health and wellbeing and more environmental conscious behaviours alongside healthy eating, will be crucial to further unpick the potential of these interventions.\"\nProfessor Ashley Adamson, Director of the NIHR SPHR, said: “Millions of us use mobile phone apps in our everyday lives. This evidence is the first of its kind to show how these apps have a part to play in helping people adopt both healthier and more sustainable diets.\n\"They can play a key role in improving public health by supporting healthier choices to prevent chronic illnesses, and conditions such as obesity. Further research will be important to helping us understand who they work best for and how they can be harnessed in the long-term to support behaviour change.”\nThe results published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity (IJBNPA).",
