  "text": "Anchored by its impact-driven platform CMI SOARS - Sustainable Orchards and Regenerative Solutions—CMI Orchards is launching its consumer-facing brand Planet Positive™ initiative.\nCMI SOARS serves as the company's central platform and portal for measuring, managing, and communicating environmental progress. By tracking greenhouse gases, reporting sustainability results, and growing carbon negative products, the company connects how fruit is grown to why it matters. The platform empowers retail partners to source regeneratively grown fruit, invest in carbon inset projects, strengthen supply chains, cut emissions, and inspire eco-conscious consumers through authentic, verified data-driven action.\n© CMI (Columbia Marketing International)Planet Positive will debut at this year's IFPA Global Produce & Floral Show.\n\"Through CMI SOARS and Planet Positive, we're bringing regenerative products to market with authenticity and accountability,\" said Bob Mast, president of CMI Orchards.\nThrough SOARS, CMI established measurable goals to increase soil biodiversity and fruit micronutrient density, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and expand carbon sequestration through regenerative practices such as composting, biochar production, and vermicomposting (worm farming).\nThe consumer-facing pillar of this initiative, Planet Positive, will debut at this year's IFPA Global Produce & Floral Show, and online. Designed to bridge CMI's regenerative achievements with a transparent, trusted way for shoppers to make environmentally responsible choices, delivered in a brand with an emotional message.\nPlanet Positive solves one of the greatest challenges in sustainability education today: consumer confusion and a lack of trust. As retailer and consumer interest in sustainability continues to rise, particularly around the connection between environmental impact, health, and nutrition, many shoppers are left unsure of who or what to believe—and sustainability is still one of the lowest purchasing drivers.\n© CMI (Columbia Marketing International)\nL-R: Bob Mast, Rochelle Bohm\n\"Planet Positive is our promise to consumers that the fruit they're buying does more good than harm—not just environmentally, but it's healthier for humans too,\" said Rochelle Bohm, vice president of marketing at CMI Orchards.\nUnlike traditional sustainability labels that get lost in the shuffle, Planet Positive was intentionally designed to stand out in a sea of monotonous labeling on the retail shelf.\n\"We recognize that sustainability certifications cover a sliding scale of practices – many, like our projects, are far more impactful than others,\" Bohm added.\nKey pillars of Planet Positive include:\n- Carbon negative impact: Products that remove more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit.\n- Nutrient-rich produce: Regenerative soils growing stronger, more nutrient-dense fruit.\n- Closed-loop systems: Orchard and crop byproducts transformed into soil amendments to reduce waste and boost biodiversity.\n- Soil regeneration: Composting, biochar, and cover cropping to enhance fertility and resilience.\n- Transparency & trust: A Planet Positive seal that assures measurable environmental benefits and authenticity.\nThe company invites attendees to this year's show to visit its booth, #839, to learn how it is helping retailers bring regenerative agriculture to life at retail.\nFor more information:\nKaci Komstadius\nCMI Orchards, LLC\nTel: (509) 888-0536[[email protected]](https://www.freshplaza.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ddb6bcbeb4b69dbeb0b4b2afbeb5bcafb9aef3beb2b0e2aea8bfb7b8bea9e08fb8aeadb2b3aeb8fda9b2fd9bafb8aeb58db1bca7bcf3beb2b0fdbcafa9b4beb1b8)www.cmiorchards.comhttp://www.cmisoars.com/",
