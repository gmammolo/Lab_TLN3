  "text": "An unexpectedly large number of agriculture-related businesses have applied to join the SURGE program in Suriname. The government initiative, supported financially by the World Bank, is designed to help entrepreneurs establish and grow their businesses.\nAccording to local reports about the program, \"There are countless stories to tell about Surinamese entrepreneurs who refuse to be discouraged by the country's economically challenging environment. With perseverance and passion for their craft, they are doing everything they can to make their businesses succeed.\"\nLaunched in 2023, the SURGE program selected five companies focused on fruit and vegetable production to receive support. Among them is a cherry (acerola) producer that has certified both its cultivation and pulp-processing operations under the Demeter label. All of its pulp is exported, and the company plans to expand its acreage from 25 to 100 hectares.\nOther examples include growers who, with the help of the program, have started cultivating crops both in open fields and in modern greenhouses equipped with advanced monitoring systems.\nThe SURGE program assists selected entrepreneurs in scaling up their operations, offering guidance as the Surinamese government emphasizes the importance of investing in tourism and agriculture—alongside the country's growing offshore oil and gas industry.\nOur editorial team recently visited Suriname and gathered numerous stories on the ground. Many of these have already been published on our news platforms, with more to come. These reports highlight both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for Suriname's agricultural sector.\n© Pieter Boekhout | FreshPlaza.com\nFor more information:\nSURGEhttps://surge.sr/",
