  "text": "At over 12,000 feet above sea level, apple cultivation has achieved a new milestone in Himachal Pradesh's Kinnaur district. A high-density apple orchard in Malling has successfully adapted to extreme climatic conditions, demonstrating that modern horticultural systems can function in the cold, arid Himalayan region.\nThe development was highlighted during Apple Day 2.0, held at the high-altitude demonstration orchard. The event was jointly organised by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Kinnaur and the Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station (RHRTS), Sharbo, under Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni. The event focused on high-density apple plantations and natural farming practices to promote sustainable fruit production in tribal areas.\nEstablished in 2021 under the Tribal Sub-Plan Project, the Malling apple orchard includes ten premium apple varieties such as Super Chief, Scarlet Spur, Red Velox, Oregon Spur II, and Gala Val, grown successfully on seedling rootstocks. The orchard serves as a research and demonstration site for innovation and sustainable high-altitude horticulture.\nDr. Arun Kumar, Fruit Scientist, presented field-based innovations to enhance apple productivity under extreme elevations. Dr. Pramod Sharma, Associate Director (Research) and Head of KVK Kinnaur, discussed the role of high-density planting and natural farming in maintaining sustainable orchard systems. He also underlined nature-based approaches, multi-layer cropping, and crop diversification for long-term resilience in cold desert zones.\nDev Raj Kaith, Subject Matter Specialist (Horticulture), informed farmers about ongoing government programs, crop insurance, subsidy frameworks, and biological pest management options. Jai Kumar from ATMA reported that over 1,000 farmers, including 99 from Pooh Block, are currently participating in the Natural Farming Cluster Initiative, with six villages, Nako, Chango, Ribba, Asrang, Thangi, and Kanam, developed as model clusters.\nDr. Deepika Negi, Fruit Scientist, encouraged orchard diversification through the inclusion of high-value crops such as strawberries to complement apple cultivation and increase farm revenue. Ashish Gupta, Food System Analyst, presented the CETARA Certification System for Natural Farming produce in Himachal Pradesh, aimed at supporting climate-resilient and ecological production systems.\nThe Malling orchard now functions as a field reference for combining high-density horticulture, natural farming, and research-based management techniques suited to Himachal Pradesh's high-altitude apple-growing regions.\nSource: The News Himachal",
