By providing the lowest-emission options on each lane, Freightera enables businesses to achieve a measurable climate impact today , without waiting for fully zero-emission technologies.\nReal Reductions, Real Results\nWhile the introduction of heavy-duty electric and hydrogen trucks faces challenges like range, charging infrastructure, and fleet scalability, Freightera is delivering immediate results.

Key achievements in the most recent year tracked include:\n● 52% of Freightera shippers reduced net CO₂e emissions by 20% or more.\n● 674 firms slashed emissions by 40% or more.\n● The average shipper cut emissions by 23% using Freightera’s low-emission platform.\n● The top 136 greenest shippers cut emissions by over 70%.\nA Practical Path to Sustainability\nFreightera’s approach doesn’t rely on waiting for perfect technology. By comparing carriers on each lane based on EPA emissions data versus fleet average performance, Freightera ensures shippers minimize their carbon footprint today. Looking ahead, Freightera anticipates zero-emission freight scaling in 2026–2027 as factors like battery density, charging infrastructure, and OEM fleets align. The company is poised to support end-to-end zero-emission lanes as they become viable.\nWhat Shippers Can Do Now\nFreightera recommends a hybrid strategy for shippers:\n● Use Freightera’s platform to reduce emissions today through optimized, low-emission routing.\n● Prepare for zero-emission lanes as they emerge.\n● Integrate freight emissions into procurement, reporting, and sustainability goals.\n“Freightera’s mission is to empower shippers with practical, impactful solutions for sustainable freight,” said Eric Beckwitt, Founder and CEO at Freightera. “We’re cutting emissions today and preparing for a zero-emission tomorrow.”\nFor more information about Freightera’s sustainable freight solutions, visit freightera.com.\nAbout Freightera\nFreightera is an award-winning, automated freight marketplace connecting business shippers with transportation carriers across North America.
