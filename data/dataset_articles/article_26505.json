  "text": "SENECA — When Cheryl Murphy retired from teaching science at Walhalla High School, she put her newfound free time — and science knowledge — to good use by starting a native plant nursery at her home.\nThat blossomed into Bell’s Creek Wildflower Farm.\n“These native plants are my passion because of their importance to our world,” Murphy said. “Some native plants, golden rods and asters for example, are so important that our ecosystem could not function properly without them. These are known as keystone plants.”\nThe certified S.C. Master Gardener and S.C. Master Naturalist wanted to pass along her love of native plants and the importance of planting them. She teamed up with some friends and the FARM Center to host the inaugural Golden Corner Native Plant Festival on Oct. 4, a festival bursting at the seams with plants and crafts.\n‘Head over heels’\nOne of those friends was Polly Moxley, who claimed her two passions in life are gardening and sewing.\n“If I’m not gardening, I’m sewing, and vice versa — if I’m not sewing, I’m gardening,” she said, adding she had a booth at the event to show off her sewing creations.\nMoxley first met Murphy when taking the Master Gardener course at Clemson Extension Office. She was also volunteering at the Native Plant Garden at the Pickens County Museum of Art and History.\n“It was at the Native Plant Garden that I began really learning about native plants from other native plant lovers,” Moxley said. “They are all so beautiful and each plant has a specific purpose. Some are host plants, some provide food, some are used medicinally and more.”\nHer friend Laurie Churchill, a fellow plant lover, suggested she read “Bringing Nature Home,” by Doug Tallamy.\n“This, I believe, is when I fell head over heels for native plants,” Moxley said. “The book changed the way I looked at gardens in the landscape, especially in housing developments. When I look at a nice green manicured lawn, all I can think of is that it is a desert for pollinators. There’s nothing to eat for bees or butterflies — and even more than that, there is nowhere for butterflies to lay their eggs.”\nClearing land not only affects the pollinators, but the effects spread up the food chain.\n“Where will the birds go to find food for their babies? How many trees were just taken down?” Moxley said. “Just one brood of chickadees needs about 350-570 caterpillars a day for about 16 to 18 days — the time it takes chicks to fledge. This means 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars are needed to make one clutch of chickadees.\n“These chicks can only eat caterpillars (because) bird seed is too hard for them,” she added. “No native trees, no caterpillars, no more birds.”\n‘Educational\nand inspiring’\nChurchill first met Murphy at the 2024 Pickens County Native Plant Jubilee.\n“When she told me where she lived, I was very excited to have a native plant nursery only 3 miles from my house and went to visit it the next week. I bought a lot of plants,” Churchill said. “Even back then we started talking about having something like the Jubilee in Oconee County. We wanted it to be fun, but also very educational and inspiring for native plant enthusiasts, but more importantly, for native plant ‘newbies.’”\nChurchill said the initial event was such a success, they’ve been asked to do a second one.\n“We have already had many requests to continue it, so we are looking at the first Saturday in October next year at the FARM Center again,” she said.\nMurphy thanked the collaborators who made the initial event possible.\n“I want to thank Laurie, Polly and (FARM Center executive director Daniel Rothell) who helped me make my vision a reality,” Murphy said. “Our goal was to celebrate all things native to our region and provide opportunities to purchase native plants.”\nGrowing\nthe community\nRothell said the festival was more than “a celebration of plants,” but also a “working prototype” for a “new model of community impact.”\n“Our goal is to identify passionate, capable people within the community and equip them to expand their influence by using the FARM Center as a platform for positive impact. This approach allows individuals and small groups with specialized expertise to reach a larger audience, strengthen community connections, and demonstrate how cooperation can multiply positive outcomes,” he said. “By empowering others to lead and create, The FARM Center fulfills its mission of connecting our community through agriculture, while fostering the kind of collaboration and shared purpose that helps Oconee County grow stronger together.”\nakelley@upstatetoday.com | (864) 973-6681",
