At Adani Green Energy, we believe that a sustainable future is rooted in bold innovation and collective action. This milestone reflects the shared commitment to shaping a greener tomorrow and showcases the power of education in driving meaningful change,” said Sagar Adani, Executive Director, Adani Green Energy.\n“We congratulate the Science Museum Group on achieving this significant landmark and are proud to support a gallery that continues to trigger curiosity and nurture solutions for a cleaner, more resilient world,” he added.\nThe gallery, which highlights technologies and projects from the UK and abroad -- from hydrogen power on Orkney to terracotta air-cooling façades in India and solar farms in Morocco -- is popular with both families and school groups. More than 10,000 students have now explored the gallery as part of educational visits since it opened, the company said.\n“We are delighted to have welcomed a million visitors to this stunning gallery, helping ignite curiosity among those who visit and sparking conversations about the need to generate and use energy more sustainably. Reaching this impressive milestone is a testament to the gallery’s award-winning design and the stories behind the remarkable objects on display,” said Sir Ian Blatchford, Chief Executive and Director of the Science Museum Group.\nBlatchford also expressed gratitude to Adani Green Energy -- one of the world’s leading renewable energy companies -- \"for their generous sponsorship, which made the gallery possible\".\nThe free gallery opened at the Science Museum on March 24 last year, on Level 2 in the West Hall.\nDesigned by architect and design studio Unknown Works, the Gallery recently received a Retrofit and Reuse Award from the Architect's Journal for its sustainable approach to design and installation.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
