  "text": "Find out how sustainable practices with solar energy, water reuse and environmental education transform conscious consumption and strengthen Bahia's green future.\nIn recent years, the advancement of sustainable practices with solar energy has been transforming the way society understands the relationship between energy and the environment. In this sense, Secretariat of the Environment (Sema) and Institute of Environment and Water Resources (INEMA) have stood out by uniting innovation, economy and ecological awareness in their daily actions.\nThrough ongoing programs, these institutions have reducing energy consumption, encouraging the rational use of water e promoting a culture of environmental responsibility between servers and partners. Thus, each project represents not only a real saving, but also an important step towards a more balanced model of development.\nThe adoption of solar energy systems therefore represents more than a simple technological change. It symbolizes a new way of thinking, in which sustainability occupies the center of institutional decisions.\nHistorically, the world has lived under heavy dependence on fossil fuels, which generated profound environmental impacts. However, the transition to clean fonts, like solar energy, has been gaining momentum in tropical countries, especially in Brazil.\nSince the 2000s, the country has expanded its installed capacity in solar energy. However, it was only from 2012, with the regulation of distributed generation by National Electric Energy Agency (ANEEL), that the sector began to expand rapidly.\nIn this context, Inema and Sema became part of this energy revolution, adapting its administrative practices and public policies to the demands of a more sustainable world.\nEveryday sustainability and a culture of savings in public bodies\nAt Inema, the sustainability process has become an essential part of everyday life. According to Pedro de Oliveira, Administrative Coordination (CORAD), the body signed a cooperation agreement with COELBA to install photovoltaic systems and replace conventional lamps with LED models. In this way, it was possible to reduce costs and increase energy efficiency.\nFurthermore, the campaign “Hang Up” encourages employees to adopt simple attitudes, such as turn off lights and equipment when not in use. Thus, the body demonstrates that small actions, when added together, generate great environmental results.\nAo mesmo tempo, o rational use of water became a priority. In partnership with Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), Inema implements measures that include installation of ecological urinals, tap seals and reuse of rainwater and air conditioning.\nIn this way, water consumption has been reduced, while the commitment to future of the planet.\nThese technical actions go hand in hand with internal awareness campaigns. In the end, changing habits is as important as investing in technology.\nThanks to the engagement of its employees, the institution consolidated a solid environmental culture, in which everyone understands the value of caring for natural resources.\nEnvironmental education and strengthening of collective consciousness\nAt Sema, in turn, the environmental education is treated as a essential instrument of transformation. As explained Stefane Mendes, Directorate of Environmental Education for Sustainability (DIEAS), conscious consumption is one of the central themes in the training of Ecoguardians.\nThrough these activities, the importance of reducing paper use, saving energy and disposing of waste correctly.\nThese initiatives are part of the Environmental Agenda in Public Administration (A3P), a program that seeks to incorporate sustainability into institutional practices throughout Brazil.\nThrough A3P, Sema promotes workshops, lectures and campaigns that reinforce the role of the public servant as multiplier of good practices.\nFor three months, the Ecoguardians carried out educational campaigns focused on responsible consumption and correct disposal of materials.\nAs a result, servers began to adopt more conscious behaviors, proving that information combined with practice is capable of transforming realities.\nThus, Sema demonstrates that education is the starting point for any efficient environmental policy. As people understand the impact of their actions, they become more willing to act accordingly. responsible and cooperative.\nSolar energy and green economic development\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, sustainable practices with solar energy strengthen the green economy. By investing in clean technologies, the institutions reduce expenses, increase efficiency e contribute to sustainable growth.\nAccording to a Lilian Maria, Coordination of Strategic Actions (COAES), conscious consumption helps to balance prosperity and preservation. As she explains, this consumption model strengthens fair production chains, stimulates innovation e encourages the generation of green jobs.\nInema, for example, actively participates in Water and Energy Consumption Rationalization Program, created by SAEB Ordinance No. 406/2018. This program aims to reduce waste, modernize facilities and disseminate the use of renewable technologies.\nThus, public administration becomes a example of responsible environmental management.\nFurthermore, Bahia consolidates itself as one of the main clean energy hubs in Brazil.\nThanks to high solar incidence and continuous investment in environmental policies, the state attracts companies and researchers interested in developing sustainable solutions.\nIn this way, Sema and Inema's shares gain strategic relevance, as they connect the environmental agenda to the regional economic development strategy.\nA future guided by environmental awareness\nWhen observing the trajectory of the sustainability in Brazil, it is noted that the greatest advances occur when government action joins social participation.\nIn this sense, the example of Sema and Inema demonstrates how the investment in solar energy, rational use of water and environmental education can walk together in construction of a new public management model.\nThe consolidation of these practices goes beyond financial savings, as it represents a future-oriented strategic vision.\nWhen institutions invest in clean technologies e stimulate collective awareness, promote changes that go beyond their own administrative limits.\nIn this way, the movement by sustainable practices with solar energy keeps growing and inspiring other organizations to rethink their consumption models.\nEvery action, no matter how small it may seem, has the power to generate lasting positive impacts.\nTherefore, Sema and Inema show that the sustainability is not just a distant goal, but one possible path, made of daily choices and constant commitment.\nWhen joining solar energy, water reuse e environmental education, these institutions build a green legacy that will extend for generations to come.",
