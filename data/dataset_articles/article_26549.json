  "text": "For a home that’s fresh and clean, you’ll need an air purifier. There are so many options out there, but here’s an offer from Amazon that we highly recommend — the Shark NeverChange air purifier with a 32% discount, slashing its price from $250 to a much more affordable $170. The savings of $80 won’t last forever as this is a limited-time deal, which means you need to proceed with the transaction as soon as possible if you want to make sure that you get this device for a lower price than usual.\nWhy you should buy the Shark NeverChange air purifier\nThe biggest reason to buy the Shark NeverChange air purifier is right in its name — unlike other air purifiers that require regular filter replacements, it provides up to 5 years of clean air before you need to buy a new filter for it. Over that time, the Shark NeverChange air purifier will capture 99.98% of large, small, and micro-sized particles across an area of up to 650 square feet. Helping the filter last is its DebrisDefense layer, which captures dust, hair, and lint that you can easily rinse, wipe, or vacuum off.\nThe Shark NeverChange air purifier features CleanSense IQ technology that shows how air quality changes in real time, and automatically adjusts the device’s power settings when improvements are necessary. At 100%, you have peace of mind that your family is breathing clean air. The device also comes with Odor Neutralizer technology that removes foul scents, as well as ultra-quiet performance with dimmable lights so it won’t be a disturbance during the night time. The Shark NeverChange air purifier is perfect for any bedroom, the living room, or the home office,\nIn one of the most attractive air purifier deals that we’ve recently seen, Amazon is selling the Shark NeverChange air purifier for only $170, which is 32% off its sticker price of $250. This offer will only be available for a limited time though, and there’s a chance that it’s already gone by tomorrow. If you think your home needs the Shark NeverChange air purifier, you should stop thinking about it and push forward with your purchase, as it would be a shame to miss out on the huge $80 discount.",
