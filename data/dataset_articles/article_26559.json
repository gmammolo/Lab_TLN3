  "text": "The biofloc system has revolutionized sustainable tilapia production, reducing water use, harnessing nutrients, and strengthening fish farming in Brazil.\nA sustainable tilapia production has been consolidating itself as one of the main bets for the future of Brazilian fish farming, according to a matter published.\nAmong the innovations that transform this scenario, the biofloc system, known as BFT (Biofloc Technology), stands out for combining productive efficiency and environmental responsibility.\nResearch coordinated by Embrapa Environment, in partnership with Itaipu Binacional, show expressive results of this technology: while Traditional systems can consume thousands of liters of water per kilo of fish produced, BFT uses only 135 liters.\nFurthermore, it retains approximately 46% of the phosphorus and 45% of the nitrogen in the feed within the biomass, reducing the risk of pollution and promoting the rational use of water resources.\nThis efficiency makes the method of sustainable tilapia production a real alternative for regions with water scarcity and for producers seeking greater autonomy and sustainability in cultivation.\nIntensive biofloc tilapia system guarantees efficiency and high production performance\nDuring the experiment carried out in Foz do Iguacu (PR), the biofloc system was tested in tanks circular tanks of 4,2 m³, where each unit kept approximately 5 thousand tilapia fingerlings, at a density of 395 fish per cubic meter.\nAfter 70 days of cultivation, the results were impressive: survival rate of 98%, average final weight of 20,4 grams and feed conversion of just 1,05, that is, every 1,05 kg of feed resulted in 1 kg of fish.\nThese indices reflect the biological balance of BFT, which favors the consumption of microbial flake as a natural food supplement, rich in protein and probiotic bacteria.\nContinuous control of temperature, oxygen, and suspended solids ensured the success of the process. The carbon:nitrogen ratio was maintained at 12:1, with the addition of sugar to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria.\nThis dynamic prevents algae growth and keeps the water in ideal conditions, reducing management costs and increasing animal welfare.\nThus, the intensive system demonstrates that sustainable tilapia production can achieve high levels of productivity even in small spaces.\nBiofloc technology for efficient aquaculture production reduces environmental impact and water use\nEmbrapa studies have shown that BFT drastically reduces pollution potential compared to conventional systems.\nPer ton of tilapia produced, the average residual load was 10,24 kg of phosphorus, 46,63 kg of nitrogen, and 442,47 kg of carbon. In net cages, these values can reach 18,25 kg, 77,5 kg, and 700 kg, respectively.\nThis difference proves the efficiency of sustainable tilapia production, which retains nutrients and prevents excessive discharge into aquatic ecosystems.\nIn addition to saving water, BFT offers greater biosecurity, as it is a closed, controlled system with minimal risk of species escape.\nThe impact on biodiversity was classified as moderate (level 4), lower than that observed in open systems.\nThis type of control favors the use of biofloc in urban, peri-urban and even semi-arid regions, where water availability is limited.\nThe integration of science, energy and sustainability places Brazil at the forefront of responsible aquaculture practices.\nSustainable tilapia production strengthens circular economy\nOne of the system's distinguishing features is the disposal of solid waste. The organic material removed from the tanks can be transformed into agricultural fertilizers or feed ingredients, adding value and strengthening the circular economy.\nThe research highlighted that this practice reduces waste and increases the use of resources.\nAccording to experts from Embrapa and Itaipu Binacional, the current challenge lies in the system's energy consumption, estimated at 114,6 megajoules per kilogram of fish produced, due to the need for constant aeration.\nTo overcome this limitation, investment in renewable sources and improving equipment efficiency is recommended.\nDuring the International Fish Congress & Fish Expo Brazil (IFC Brazil 2025), producers and technicians closely followed the practical results of the technology.\nProducer Valério Angelozi reported that he intends to install an experimental unit on his property, after observing that water reuse and proper management improve fish quality and reduce losses.\nThe system has proven to be applicable on a commercial scale and aligned with the global market's demands for foods with low environmental impact.\nA tilapia production sustainable supported by biofloc technology, therefore, it represents a significant advance for modern aquaculture.\nIts ability to recycle nutrients, reduce water use and generate reusable byproducts reinforces the strategic role of science in the transition to more responsible production models and profitable.",
