  "text": "Sustainable finance was the core topic on Wednesday evening, as the Luxembourg Times launched the autumn issue of its magazine – the Sustainability Issue – at an event hosted by EY Luxembourg.\nThe magazine launch event included a panel discussion and fireside chat on sustainable investment in a changing geopolitical environment. But despite a confrontational US administration, the panel broadly agreed that the industry has found its space and will not be frozen out by changing political winds.\nFollowing words of welcome from country managing partner for EY Luxembourg, Alban Aubrée, and editor-in-chief of the Luxembourg Times, Cordula Schnuer, the fireside chat focused on sustainable climate bonds and how they fit into the wider world of sustainable finance.\nThe world’s first sustainable climate bonds were issued in Luxembourg in 2007, said Laetitia Hamon, head of operations and sustainable finance at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. While the perception exists that sentiment has moved against green bonds, in reality 2024 was their second-best year to date. Turnover is slower in 2025 so far, but that is more due to market uncertainty than sentiment, she said.\nThe ESG backlash has affected funds more than bonds, but even there, Europe and Asia are still growing – especially China – and even in the USA, they are still being used, just under different names, Hamon said. Modern investors want transparency, she said, adding that the green transition is for all companies that want to engage with it – even big polluters. “Some companies really want to change, but they need the transition financing in order to be able to do that,” Hamon said.\nThe crisis that isn’t a crisis\nSome of the same points were emphasised in the panel discussion which followed. Hamon was part of the panel, joined by Vanessa Müller, services lead at EY; Lorenzo Avico, deputy CEO of the Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Initiative; and Bertrand Rocher, head of credit and research and portfolio manager at Mirova in Paris.\nThere is a slowdown in the market, though some stabilisation in recent months, Müller said when asked if sustainable finance is in crisis. “Yes and no,” she said: new ESMA guidelines have helped define what a sustainable fund is, but shifting priorities and geopolitics are shining a light on defence more than sustainability at the moment.\nThere is no crisis, according to Rocher. The sustainable finance sector continues to grow; just not as quickly. “When you work in ESG, you remember the bad years when nobody cared,” he said. “Then, suddenly it became fashionable among investors, journalists, even regulators. But what comes into fashion goes out of fashion again.” For Rocher this is actually a good thing: “We’re back to a normal period. We are working with people who know what ESG is and what it can do. We prefer to have a period like this than the fashionable period.”\nAs of June this year, there was around $4 trillion AUM in global sustainable funds, according to Avico, and Europe accounts for 88% of sustainable funds. Their share of the world total has fallen back from a 2023 peak of 7%, but he, too, agrees the sector is not in crisis. In fact, he said, yields are up 12% this year, compared to 9% for traditional investments. “If you had invested $100 in sustainable funds in 2018 you would have $154 today. In traditional funds, you would have $145,” he said.\nEven in the USA, where ESG and sustainability have become toxic terms among the political establishment, companies are still on board, Hamon said. The phenomenon of engaging but not talking about it has become known as “greenhushing”. China has issued $90 billion in green bonds already this year. And there have been positive moves in Thailand, Japan and a lot of emerging markets as well.\nFrom here, the topic moved onto the COP30 climate summit in Brazil next month, with panellists agreeing that recent summits have been disappointing, with more talk than action – but that the talk remains important. All the panellists agreed the annual meetings should continue and that having everybody around the table to talk is more important now than ever.\nCOP is important for the financial sector as well as for the public sector, Avico said, and have moved from being a place just for theory and scientific concepts into a place of strategic planning for the global economy.\nSounding a positive note, Hamon said the concept of sustainable development was first invented in 1987 – less than 40 years ago – and has come a long way since. “It’s not linear, and we are not going to see huge announcements at every COP. But it’s very important for me that they still meet,” she said.\nThe final topic the panel addressed was on the Sustainability-Related Financial Disclosures Regulation (SFDR). The article numbers, 6, 8 and 9, have ceased to be administrative codes and become de-facto marketing tools, it was noted. The EU is even considering replacing them with labels in the future.\nSFDR has been a challenge in many ways, Müller said, largely because it has been hard to initiate. “So changing for the sake of changing it, I’m not sure. But if it is clear and harmonised and well observed by managers, then why not?” Avico said he agreed with this wait-and-see attitude, as there are clearly ways the European Commission can change the regulation for the better.\nMirova welcomed SFDR and implemented Article 9 for all its funds, Rocher said, “but a few years later we discovered it just doesn’t work. It was a good idea but it will die.” Part of the reason, he believes, is that it is not necessary and that sustainable investors and fund managers are best able to hammer out the details themselves.\n“I see the revamping of SFDR very positively because we want to sell this type of funds to investors,” Hamon said. “If it takes more than ten minutes to explain what is an Article 8 or an Article 9, you’re not selling anything.” Making the definitions clearer and more concise will be a welcome change, she said.\nFinally, the panel opened up for questions from the audience that ranged from the role of nuclear power in the world of green investment, to how private retail investors can invest sustainably and not fall for greenwashing.\nThe panel discussion was followed by a networking cocktail event.\nThe magazine is available at kiosks from 16 October for €5.
