  "text": "A year after the last dam was removed, this Western river has 'come alive' with salmon\nDebra Utacia Krol\n- One year after the last of four hydroelectric dams was removed from the Klamath River in northern California, tribes and environmentalists pronounced the work a success.\n- Salmon are finding their way up the river and other wildlife species are returning as the Klamath heals from a century of poor management.\n- Threats to the river's recovery remain, mostly from funding cuts by the federal government, which has eliminated programs that still honor diversity, equity and inclusion policies.\nOne year after the final piece of concrete was removed from the last of four dams on the Klamath River in northern California, tribes and environmentalists say the river, the fish and other species that depend on the Klamath's health are recovering and tribes continue to reclaim their lands and waters.\nBarry McCovey, Yurok Tribe's fisheries director, said during a news conference Oct. 9 that the river is much clearer than it used to be.\n\"We fish with gill nets and a lot of times it becomes very difficult to fish when there's a lot of suspended algae fouling the nets,\" McCovey said. But now, people's ability to catch fish was much improved.\nToz Soto, fisheries program manager for the Karuk Tribe, said that the consortium carefully monitored water conditions in the weeks after the last dam came down, as silty water flowed down the banks. The tribe's real-time water quality monitors found that after the large rush of water once held behind the dams had passed, water quality greatly improved and continues to be good.\nWater also is cooler now that the artificially heated water flowing from the dams has ceased, which is optimal for salmon health.\nDamon Goodman, Mount Shasta-Klamath Regional director for California Trout, said the groups involved in river restoration are learning what salmon are teaching people about dam removal.\n\"Almost instantly after dam removal, the fish returned in greater numbers than I expected and maybe anyone expected,\" he said. After the first fall, Chinook salmon were spotted in Jenny Creek, he said, and a consortium of tribes, environmentalists and state wildlife officials documented about 7,700 Chinook migrating upstream from Oct. 21 to Dec. 28, 2024 — about 558 a day.\n\"And what the fish have shown us is something extraordinary,\" Goodman said. \"The river seemed to come alive.\"\nA river once near death resuscitated\nThe Klamath River suffered through more than 100 years of mismanagement and injustices against tribal communities. Dams were built over ancestral Shasta Nation lands. The Upper Klamath Basin was replumbed for agriculture. Upstream from Upper Klamath Lake, a key tributary was channelized and wetlands drained, resulting in massive amounts of phosphorus flowing into the Upper Klamath Lake and, eventually, the lower river.\nAs the flood of algae coursed downriver, it coalesced in the reservoirs behind the dams, which once had supplied electricity to the region before they were decommissioned. The rush of algae and the shallow waters of Iron Gate and Copco reservoirs created nurseries for even more algae to grow, and the river downstream was literally poisoned.\nThese and other shocks to the Klamath River Basin's ancient ecosystem almost killed the river, the fish and the people who rely on the river for subsistence and ceremony.\nAfter a catastrophic fish kill in 2002 caused by toxic algae released from the upstream reservoirs, tribes, environmentalists and their allies acted, supported by the California and Oregon wildlife agencies' science reports on river and fish health. After a 20-year struggle, the four dams' owner finally agreed to remove the dams. The last coffer holding water back was breached in August 2024.\nWatching fish make it through a dam 'is pretty cool'\nSalmon continue to migrate upstream past where they were once stymied by the four dams for more than a century. Chinook salmon were spotted Sept. 24 using a fish ladder to traverse the Keno Dam, about 43 miles northeast of where the Copco Dam once impeded their migration.\nThe Klamath Tribes, whose traditional lands encompass the headwaters of the river and several tributaries, celebrated Oct. 7 when fall Chinook salmon were spotted at the Link River Dam about 15 miles upstream from the Keno Dam for the first time in more than 100 years. The Link River Dam is the final barrier before reaching Upper Klamath Lake.\n\"It was a pretty incredible thing to witness,\" said Mark Hereford, Klamath fisheries reintroduction project leader for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The state and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the dam, partnered to install video cameras to monitor fish movements at the fish ladder.\n\"Just observing fish right below the dam and then looking at the fish getting through the dam was pretty cool.\"\nOther species also seem happy that the river is growing healthy.\nBeavers are returning to the Copco Valley and Beaver Creek, Soto said. Bears, bald eagles, ospreys and other such species have more food, said John Oberholzer of the Karuk Tribe.\n\"It goes all the way up the food chain, and we're going to see the entire ecosystem get more nutrients from those salmon that are coming upriver,\" he said.\nThat includes the tiniest species. McCovey said miniscule invertebrates, which are a key part of the food web for the river, are doing well.\n\"We've been studying these bugs that lie on the bottom of the river and they're a really good indicator of river health,\" he said.\nBest of all, everybody at the meeting agreed: the river no longer stinks.\nShasta Indian Nation: 'The rocks popping from the river hitting them made us happy'\nFor the Shasta Indian Nation, removing the dams meant reclaiming the lands the reservoirs had drowned.\nIn June, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state would restore 2,800 acres of their ancestral homeland to the 300-member tribe. That land included K’íkac’é·ki and K’účasčas, two of their most culturally important parcels. The tribe also got the old powerhouse, which it is turning into a cultural center.\n\"Many of us feel we carry a generational responsibility to the land and to the water,\" said Sami Jo Difuntorum, Shasta Indian Nation's cultural preservation officer. \"This particular area holds the stories of our ancestors.\"\nDifuntorum said that when she first saw the landscape after the reservoir had drained, it was stark and barren. \"Nothing had grown there for about 100 years,\" she said.\nBut, when Difuntorum heard the water coursing through its old path in her ancestral community, \"the rocks popping from the river made us happy.\"\n\"It meant the earth was starting to heal. It meant the river was starting to heal. And ultimately, our people were starting to heal.\"\nAs the land returns to its former lushness, the tribe is reclaiming other parts of its heritage. She said the people are implementing traditional ecological knowledge and stewardship. They're also working on revegetation, building a food sovereignty program, monitoring cultural sites and restoring tributaries like Jenny Creek.\nAnd, the tribe has revived something that they had longed for: ceremonies.\n\"We held the salmon calling ceremony for the first time in 100 years,\" Difuntorum said.\nThe work continues even as federal funding dries up\nSome of the Klamath's other principal tributaries and key salmon nurseries were guaranteed minimum flows thanks to a bill signed by Newsom in September. Assembly Bill 263 requires maintaining river flows for at-risk salmon runs on the Scott and Shasta rivers.\nTribes and environmentalists hailed the progress, and said more work is underway. Tributary restoration work continues, while replanting and monitoring plant growth is still underway.\nThe Upper Klamath Basin is undergoing projects including rotating wetlands and crops along the lake and restoring the Klamath Tribes' important fish, the c'waam and koptu.\nSoto said an even more important salmon run needs attention.\n\"The spring wild-run Chinook population is less than a thousand fish,\" he said. Although a hatchery on the Trinity River provides spring Chinook, the wild fish are on the verge of extinction. \"But there's optimism that we can recover the spring Chinook now that we have the headwaters of the Klamath River.\"\nThey're also concerned that the federal government is stalling and even calling into question funding and policy support for continued restoration work. That includes several federal grants to monitor and count fish populations on the Klamath and conduct restoration projects that were abruptly canceled in late September as part of an Interior Department directive slashing $14 million from 79 groups who have indicated or still indicate they honor diversity, equity and inclusion.\nAll seven of CalTrout's grants were abruptly terminated, including its salmon monitoring program, which was slashed with no explanation. Federal grants for the Mid Klamath Watershed Council, based in Karuk lands were also slashed with no notice or reason why. The community-based nonprofit conducts forest and watershed restoration, community stewardship training and coordinates with both tribal and non-tribal communities to prevent and mitigate wildfires along the river.\nGoodman said the project to monitor the fish is only at its beginning, and losing funding for scientific data collection on the world's largest restoration project was a setback.\n\"This data is crucial to help regulators make information decisions about watersheds and fisheries,\" Goodman said. \"While we're already seeing that the Klamath Dam removal was a success, we need consistent and accurate data to understand how much of a success this project was.\"\nHe said CalTrout was fundraising to fill the gap for the lost grants.\nBut there's also good news: Naysayers who claimed that salmon couldn't make it past some waterfalls in the old dam areas were proven wrong when the fish sailed up the ripples as they had for millennia before the dams stopped them.\nAnd even as the federal government pulls funding and support back, the groups restoring their ancestral homes say they won't give up their efforts until the entire basin is restored to health.\n\"As we move forward, we'll learn more and more about pieces of this puzzle,\" McCovey said. He said the Klamath's success meant that a major landscape-scale restoration project is possible and can serve as a model for other such projects.\n\"And, you know who else is liking the river after the dams? Shasta people,\" Difuntorum said.\n\"I've spotted a few in the area.\"\nDebra Krol reports on Indigenous communities at the confluence of climate, culture and commerce in Arizona and the Intermountain West.
