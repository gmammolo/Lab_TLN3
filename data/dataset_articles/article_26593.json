In Kenya, that could mean 82 fewer hot days, a reduction of 30 in India and the US and a drop of 29 hot days in China and Britain.\nThey also applied their analysis to six heatwaves, including a deadly heatwave that swept Mexico and part of the southwestern United States last year, killing scores of people.\nSince the Paris Agreement was signed, the research found that the Mexican heatwave had become 86% more likely and about 0.3C hotter.\n[Scientists hail rapid estimate of climate change’s role in heat deaths as a first]\nUnder the 2.6C warming scenario expected this century, similar heatwaves are expected to become an additional 1.7C hotter. But under the 4C outlook, such events would have been 3.5C hotter than what was observed in 2024, the researchers said.\nBut while the global treaty has helped avoid the worst possible outcomes, Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central, said the world was still headed for “a dangerously hot future”.\n“The impacts of recent heatwaves show that many countries are not well prepared to deal with 1.3C of warming, let alone the 2.6C of warming projected if – and it’s a big if – countries meet their current emissions reduction pledges.”\nDahl said “faster, deeper, and more ambitious emissions cuts are crucial to ensure future generations live in a safe climate”.\nCO2 levels soar to record\nOn Wednesday, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere soared by a record amount to new highs in 2024, putting the planet on a course for greater long-term temperature increases.\nIn its Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, the UN agency traced the increase to human activities, wildfires and a decline in absorption by so-called carbon sinks such as forests and the ocean.\nWMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett said the heat trapped by greenhouse gases was “turbo-charging our climate and leading to more extreme weather”.\n“Reducing emissions is therefore essential not just for our climate but also for our economic security and community well-being,” Barrett said.\nFollowing a series of intense heatwaves across the world in 2024 – the hottest year on record, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that extreme heat has become the “new normal” and appealed to countries to reduce the devastating consequences.\nDespite 500,000 heat-related deaths recorded annually, access to early-warning systems is limited in some regions and heat adaptation continues to lag, particularly when it comes to finance, governance and long-term measures, the WWA and Climate Central researchers said.\nThey called for improved early-warning systems, heat action plans and monitoring mechanisms, especially in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia, and said such policies should extend beyond the health sphere to be integrated into urban planning, labor protection, infrastructure and social policy.\nThey emphasised the importance of heat warnings by national weather services, currently only issued in about half of all countries, adding that long-term solutions such as increasing shaded areas and trees in cities and strengthening health systems could prevent about 100,000 deaths each year.\n“The danger of heat will only increase this century, so it is crucial that every country implements measures that help keep people safe,” said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.",
