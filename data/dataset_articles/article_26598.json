  "text": "The chairperson of the Environment and Agriculture Management Oversight Committee, Hluphi Gafane, has urged Tshwane residents to visit and explore the city’s bird sanctuaries.\nGafane said bird sanctuaries play a vital role in conservation.\n“Bird sanctuaries are very important in conserving biodiversity, providing educational opportunities, and offering citizens recreational and mental health benefits through connection with nature,” she explained.\nShe reiterates that the sanctuaries serve as habitats for diverse bird species, supporting environmental education programs, facilitating birdwatching from hides, and promoting general outdoor activities that improve residents’ well-being.\nGafane conducted a pre-inspection of the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary and the Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve to monitor the continuous maintenance taking place at these nature reserves.\n“It allowed me an opportunity to engage with staff on site and allowed me to gain a first-hand insight into ongoing conservation efforts, infrastructural needs, and operational challenges,” she said.\nGafane said this pre-inspection was undertaken in preparation for the official inspection that will be conducted with all the committee members in November.\nThe Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary received an early Christmas gift last year – two adorable baby blue cranes have hatched, marking a joyous occasion for conservationists and nature lovers.\nOfficials were unsure when the hatching took place and they spotted the birds on November 12, 2024. According to the metro, the Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary was named after South Africa’s greatest ornithologist and mammalogist, J Austin Roberts.\nHe was born in Pretoria in 1883 and grew up in Potchefstroom as a minister’s son. He received his grounding from Thomas Ayres, a famous pioneer amateur ornithologist based there.\nThe University of Pretoria presented the self-taught Roberts with an honorary doctorate for his many achievements, which include standard South African reference books on mammals and birds.\nThe Austin Roberts Bird Sanctuary was officially proclaimed as a nature reserve on February 26, 1985, in the Walker Spruit open space system.\nTwo streams, the Walker and the Argo, feed water into wetland basins.\nNature lovers may visit the facility to see bird life first-hand, as a wide variety of birds can be observed from the bird hide, guided walks can be booked in advance, and there is an exhibition hall at the sanctuary.\nDo you have more information about the story?\nPlease send us an email to [email protected] or phone us on 083 625 4114.\nFor free breaking and community news, visit Rekord’s websites: Rekord East\nFor more news and interesting articles, like Rekord on Facebook , follow us on Twitter or Instagram or TikTok .",
