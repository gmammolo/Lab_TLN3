  "text": "HONG KONG , Oct. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- GIBO Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: GIBO ), Asia's leading technology-driven creative ecosystem, today introduced the SparkRWA Green Creator Economy Initiative , an expansion of its SparkRWA platform that transforms creative inspiration into verifiable and measurable real-world impact.\nThis initiative marks a major milestone in GIBO's mission to merge idea tokenization , creative empowerment, and sustainable innovation , forming a unified ecosystem where creativity fuels both economic and environmental growth.\nFrom Inspiration to Impact: A New Era of Sustainable Creativity\nSparkRWA's Green Creator Economy introduces an intelligent verification and reward system that connects creators, innovators, and enterprises to the global sustainability movement. By combining AI-based verification, real-world data analytics, and multi-currency settlement through GIBO Click , the platform enables every idea—whether artistic, technical, or environmental—to be validated, valued, and rewarded .\nThe initiative's Green Integration Framework empowers users to turn ideas into measurable sustainability assets. Each verified creation—ranging from eco-product design and renewable energy innovation to green storytelling—can be recorded, analyzed, and recognized as part of a growing network of global impact contributors.\n\"SparkRWA redefines what it means to be a creator,\" said Zelt Kueh , CEO of GIBO Holdings Ltd. \"In the age of sustainability, creation must do more than entertain — it must inspire and improve the world we live in. Through SparkRWA, we're building a system that verifies inspiration and turns it into lasting environmental and social value.\"\nThe SparkRWA Green Integration Framework\nThe framework operates through three synergistic layers:\nCreative Tokenization – Artists, writers, engineers, and innovators can register and verify their ideas or intellectual properties as unique, traceable assets on SparkRWA. Sustainability Verification – Environmental projects, renewable energy concepts, and green innovations can be validated for measurable impact—such as carbon reduction, energy efficiency, or material recycling. Value Circulation via GIBO Click – The integrated GIBO Click analytics and settlement system provides creators and partners with transparent multi-currency monetization, allowing both creative and sustainable outputs to generate tangible returns. Through this structure, SparkRWA bridges the creative economy and the green economy , enabling creators and corporations to collaborate transparently and efficiently.\nApplications Across Industries\nThe Green Creator Economy is designed to support a wide spectrum of sustainable innovation:\nGreen Product Design: Creators develop eco-packaging, smart appliances, and low-impact consumer goods that SparkRWA can verify and tokenize. Renewable Energy: Solar, hydrogen, or waste-to-energy projects register measurable generation data and environmental benefits through SparkRWA's verification layer. Carbon Credit Storytelling: Filmmakers and writers can produce verified creative campaigns that educate audiences on sustainability and carbon reduction. Circular Innovation: Recycling, upcycling, and sustainable fashion ideas are validated for originality and ecological contribution. Each verified contribution feeds into SparkRWA's Global Green Creator Registry , creating a permanent record of creative and environmental impact accessible to investors, brands, and communities worldwide.\nA Global Alliance for Sustainable Creation\nWith over 86 million users across the GIBO ecosystem , SparkRWA aims to establish the Global Green Creator Alliance — a decentralized community uniting creators, enterprises, and innovators who believe that creativity should drive sustainability.\nThe alliance will foster collaborations between artists, green-tech developers, and organizations to co-develop projects that align creative excellence with environmental responsibility.\nDriving the Next Frontier of Creative Intelligence\nThe expansion of SparkRWA's Green Creator Economy Initiative is part of GIBO's long-term roadmap to integrate AI-powered verification, creative monetization, and sustainable intelligence into a single ecosystem.\nBy bridging creation, validation, and value circulation , GIBO is setting a new standard for how the next generation of creators and innovators contribute to both culture and the planet.\nAbout GIBO Holdings Limited\nGIBO Holdings Ltd. is a unique and integrated AIGC animation streaming platform with extensive functionalities provided to both viewers and creators that serves a broad community of young people across Asia to create, publish, share and enjoy AI-generated animation video content.
