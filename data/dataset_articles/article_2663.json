  "text": "CCTV footage has surfaced of a brazen snatching incident targeting a private TV channel's reporter in Rawalpindi. The armed suspects, who concealed their identities, also attempted to rob a woman and a man nearby. When the man resisted, the suspects opened fire and fled the scene.\nAccording to the police, robbers stole a motorcycle, mobile phone, and cash from Fahad Bashir within the limits of the Race Course police station. Shortly after, the same suspects carried out another crime within the jurisdiction of Naseerabad police station. CCTV footage of both incidents has been obtained.\nIn the first video, the suspects can be seen confronting Fahad Bashir, who was accompanied by two children, and robbing him at gunpoint. The footage clearly showed them fleeing with the stolen motorcycle and valuables.\nIn the second video, the robbers, using the same stolen motorcycle, attempted to rob another man, Usman, who was walking with his sister. Usman resisted which led to a scuffle. The suspects opened fire, but Usman escaped unharmed. The suspects fled the scene.\nPolice officials have confirmed that an investigation is underway, and efforts are being made to identify and apprehend the culprits.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
