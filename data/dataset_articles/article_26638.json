  "text": "Phys.org\nwebsite\nPullman\nHelping farmers, boosting biofuels: Study shows promising cover crop benefits\nBy Washington State University,\n1 hours agoNew research has found cover crops that are viable in Washington's normal \"off season\" don't hurt the soil and can be sold as a biofuel source. After harvest, farmland often sits fallow and unused until growers seed in the next crop. Soil can erode, weeds can take root, and farmers don't make any money during that time. Cover crops can eliminate or reduce some of those issues, but many farmers have concerns about their effects on soil quality, a reduced growing window for their primary crop, and the inability to sell the cover crop.",
