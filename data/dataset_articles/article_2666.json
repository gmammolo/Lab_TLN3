  "text": "Murder suspect appears in court, victims families remember their loved ones\nBOURBON COUNTY, Ky. (ABC 36 NEWS NOW) – The suspect in a double murder in Bourbon County appeared virtually before a judge in Paris, Wednesday afternoon.\n19-year-old Christopher Taulbee is accused of killing his child’s mother, 20-year-old Dixieana Brainard, and her boyfriend 24-year-old Chuck Callaway last Thursday (04/03).\nTaulbee entered a not guilty plea.\nDixie’s parents, Daniel and Amanda Brainard, recall the kind of person their daughter was.\n“She was very tough. Dixie didn’t back down from nothing,” said Daniel.\nHer father saying he has heard many stories, even from people he doesn’t know, about how great a person his daughter was and how many lives she touched.\nHer parents say she was protective, of her siblings and her child, which she shared with Taulbee.\n“The day she had her baby, we, as every parent, were concerned about their children, they’re concerned about what kind of parent they’re going to be,” said Daniel.\nAmanda adding, “She exceeded that.”\nChuck Calloway’s siblings, Tyler, Crystal and Jessica say he moved to Paris from Alabama to start a new life and was a loving father to his two children.\n“He was very active in their life,” said Crystal. “He was happy, they were happy, and that’s how it should be.”\nAll three want to make sure his children, and everyone, remember what kind of person chuck was.\n“He was a loving person,” said Tyler. “He wouldn’t ever hurt nobody.”\nCrystal said, “He was full of life and very joyful and would make you smile. Even though he got on our nerves sometimes.”\nDaniel and Amanda say they will continue to show up for their daughter, no matter what.\n“There’s not going to be a day that goes by that we don’t have the pain from our daughter being gone,” said Daniel.\nTaulbee, accused of the shooting death of Dixie Brainard and stabbing and beating Chuck Calloway to death will be back in court on April 16.",
