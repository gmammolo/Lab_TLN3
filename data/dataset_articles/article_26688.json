  "text": "Recycled Plastics Market to Reach USD 103.59 Billion by 2030 Driven by Rising Packaging Demand\nMordor Intelligence - Thursday, October 16, 2025.\nSubmitted by Mordor Intelligence.\nRecycled Plastics Market Outlook\nThe Recycled Plastics Market size is estimated at USD 72.66 billion in 2025, and is expected to reach USD 103.59 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 7.35% during the forecast period (2025-2030). This growth is driven by increasing regulations on recycled content, rising demand for sustainable packaging, and the growing adoption of advanced recycling processes. As companies focus on reducing plastic waste and meeting sustainability targets, the Recycled Plastics Market is gaining significant attention worldwide. Asia-Pacific currently leads the market in size and growth rate, while other regions are steadily catching up with initiatives promoting recycled plastics usage.\nThe rising awareness of environmental concerns and corporate commitments to net-zero goals is making high-quality recycled polymers an important commodity across industries such as packaging, automotive, and construction. The Recycled Plastics Market share is increasingly influenced by players investing in improved recycling technologies and high-quality feedstock, enhancing both production efficiency and the usability of recycled materials across multiple applications.\nKey Trends in the Recycled Plastics Market\n1. Regulatory Mandates for Recycled Content:\nCountries in Asia-Pacific, including India, Vietnam, and the Philippines, are enforcing laws requiring minimum recycled content in packaging. These regulations push FMCG brands to adopt recycled plastics and ensure compliance with local recycling targets.\n2. Growth of Chemical Recycling:\nChemical recycling capacity is expanding rapidly, with more than 5 million tonnes expected globally by the next few years. Advanced recycling techniques such as pyrolysis, depolymerization, and solvent-based dissolution allow for processing mixed plastics and multilayer films that traditional mechanical recycling cannot handle.\n3. Corporate Sustainability Programs:\nMany multinational companies are locking in long-term recycled resin contracts to hedge against virgin polymer price fluctuations. Scope-3 greenhouse gas accounting links recycled content to net-zero targets, further increasing demand for high-quality recycled polymers.\n4. Technological Improvements in Sorting:\nAI-enabled optical sorters are increasing collection yields and improving feedstock quality. Countries like Japan and South Korea are using these technologies to achieve higher purity levels in recycled plastics, which can now meet food-grade and industrial standards.\nCheck out more details and stay updated with the latest industry trends, including the Japanese version for localized insights: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/ja/industry-reports/recycled-plastics-market?utm_source=prsync\nSegmentation in the Recycled Plastics Market\n-\nBy Polymer Type:\n-\nPolyethylene (PE)\n-\nHigh-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)\n-\nLow/Linear-Low Density Polyethylene (LD/LLDPE)\n-\nPolyethylene Terephthalate (PET)\n-\nPolypropylene (PP)\n-\nPolyvinyl Chloride (PVC)\n-\nPolystyrene (PS)\n-\nOther Plastics (ABS, PC, PA, etc.)\n-\nBy Recycling Process:\n-\nMechanical Recycling\n-\nChemical / Advanced Recycling (Pyrolysis, Depolymerization, Dissolution)\n-\nEnergy Recovery (Plastic-to-Fuel)\n-\nOthers (Biological - enzymatic/microbial)\n-\nBy Product Form:\n-\nFlakes\n-\nPellets / Granules\n-\nPowder\n-\nOthers (Chips, Regrind, Sheets, etc.)\n-\nBy End-Use Application:\n-\nPackaging\n-\nFood-Grade\n-\nNon-Food Grade\n-\nBuilding & Construction\n-\nAutomotive\n-\nElectrical & Electronics\n-\nTextiles & Apparel\n-\nConsumer Products\n-\nAgriculture & Horticulture\n-\nOther Applications (General Manufacturing, Medical Devices, etc.)\n-\nBy Geography:\n-\nNorth America: United States, Canada, Rest of North America\n-\nSouth America: Brazil.
