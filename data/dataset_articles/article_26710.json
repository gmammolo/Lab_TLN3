  "text": "A now-Kelowna resident recently peddled along Penticton’s iconic Granfondo route in support of feeding families in his home country.\nBohdan Chekerenda, who, along with his family, fled war-torn Ukraine more than three years ago, cycled 150 kilometres to raise funds for “Peremoha (Victory) Bread” on Oct. 11.\nThe bakery is a registered charity run entirely by volunteers, and has delivered over 2.5 million loaves to Ukrainian families in need since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022.\nThis marked the third year in a row that Chekerenda has cycled in support of Ukraine.\n“Every pedal stroke reminds me that people in Ukraine are enduring far greater hardships,” says Chekerenda. “If my ride inspires even one more person to donate — to feed someone and give them hope — then it’s worth every kilometre.”\nIt costs Victory Bread just 60 cents to make a loaf, with every dollar raised translating directly into food, non-profit organization Okanagan 4 Ukraine Foundation (O4U) said in a media release.\nUkraine’s NovaPost has delivered the bread free of charge, “ensuring supplies reach even the hardest-hit areas,” it added.\nO4U added that it was “proud” to support Chekerenda’s third annual ride.\n“Food security remains one of the most urgent humanitarian challenges in Ukraine,” said Dr. Kate Woodman of O4U. “Bohdan’s ride shows how one person’s determination can spark generosity across an entire community — turning compassion into bread and hope.”\nBlack Press Media has reached out to O4U for a final count on how much was raised through the event.",
