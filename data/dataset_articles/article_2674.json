  "text": "HARTFORD, CT – With state school districts going into spring break this month, many Connecticut residents are heading out of state, including to Florida. But upon arriving in the Sunshine State, some Connecticut residents have been dismayed to learn that their reservations for rental cars would not be honored, even after they paid a deposit and submitted payment information.\nThe Office of Attorney General William Tong on Wednesday sent a letter to the Avis Budget Group following complaints that vehicle rental locations in Florida may be improperly refusing service to licensed Connecticut drivers.\nThe websites of Avis, Budget, and Payless suggest that they will refuse to rent vehicles to Connecticut consumers in Florida if they have certain Connecticut driver licenses, including licenses imprinted with “Not for Federal Identification,” claiming such licenses are “not valid for identification purposes” and not “recognized by the State of Florida to drive a vehicle on public roads.”\nThese statements appear only on FAQ pages on the Avis, Budget, and Payless websites but do not appear to be prominently displayed to consumers when making vehicle reservations or providing personal information or payment details.\nThe Avis website in question contains the following statement:\n“Certain, limited out-of-state licenses are not, pursuant to state law, recognized by the State of Florida to drive a vehicle on public roads. These licenses are not valid for identification purposes and will have a statement similar to:\n- Not For Federal Identification\n- Driving Privilege Only\n- Not Valid for Identification\n“This policy applies to any state that issues this type of driver’s license, including Connecticut & Delaware.”\nAssistant Attorney General Joseph Gasser stated in the letter that these denials of service to Connecticut drivers with licenses imprinted “Not for Federal Identification” appear to be based on a misapplication of Florida Statute § 322-033(2), which purports to reject “licenses issued by another state exclusively to undocumented immigrants.”\nGasser stated that such licenses had been issued since at least 2011 “to Connecticut residents who are citizens or otherwise documented residents of the United States. They are valid driver licenses and are not ‘issued by another state exclusively to undocumented immigrants.’”\nGasser requested information from Avis Budget on its policies related to Connecticut licenses, disclosures provided to consumers, and complaints from Connecticut consumers.\nRELATED\nTong Joins 22 Other State AGs To Back Keeping Bank Overdraft Fee Protection\nAttorney General William Tong, alongside a coalition of 22 other state attorneys general, has urged the U.S. House of Representatives to reject a resolution that would overturn a key 2024 rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) aimed at curbing what they called excessive overdraft fees charged by major banks.\nHousing Bill Banning Some AI Data Advances Out Of Judiciary Committee\nHARTFORD, CT — Renters and housing developers could benefit from a housing bill that advanced Friday out of the Judiciary Committee with language permitting developers to collect attorney fees from towns and also outlawing some artificial intelligence algorithms in the setting of rental rates.\nHartford HealthCare, UnitedHealthcare Reach Agreement, Avoid Disruption\nHartford HealthCare and UnitedHealthcare have reached a multiyear contract agreement that ensures UnitedHealthcare members will maintain in-network access to Hartford HealthCare’s hospitals, physicians, and services, according to the two companies and the Connecticut Office of the Healthcare Advocate.\nCT Consumer Counsel Says Verizon-Frontier Settlement Is A Win For Consumers\nA proposed settlement between state consumer protection authorities, Verizon, and Frontier is a win for consumers, according to the state Office of the Consumer Counsel.\nBill To Address Gambling Addiction Sent To House\nHARTFORD, CT – The Public Health Committee voted to send House Bill 7215 to the floor of the House on Wednesday to address problem gambling, particularly as it relates to internet gaming disorder, which has surged since the state legalized online sports betting and casino gaming in 2021.\nTong Lays Out Security Options Following 23AndMe’s Bankruptcy\nWith the announcement that genetic testing company 23andMe filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said state residents have the right to delete their genetic data and request the company destroy DNA samples under the Connecticut Data Privacy Act.\nOpinion | Connecticut’s Housing Crisis Won’t Be Solved Without Zoning Reform\nAs the housing crisis continues in Connecticut, guest columnist Kirk A. Wesley of the Open Communities Alliance keeps hearing from families about rent hikes that outpace their paychecks – and he’d like to see the state pass stronger protections to ensure that landlords cannot uproot tenants without a valid reason.",
