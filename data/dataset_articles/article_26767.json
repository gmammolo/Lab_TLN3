  "text": "Delhi CM welcomes SC nod for green firecrackers\nShe said it also reflects a balanced approach towards environmental protection.\nChief Minister Gupta was present on ground zero, and inspected the cleaning work underway, while she also reviewed the report issued by the on-site laboratory for testing the river’s water.\nAhead of the upcoming Chhath festival, inspections were carried out on Thursday to review preparations around the Kalindi Kunj area (Madanpur Khadar) as Chief Minister Rekha Gupta expressed satisfaction over froth control and cleaning work in the Yamuna river.\nChief Minister Gupta was present on ground zero, and inspected the cleaning work underway, while she also reviewed the report issued by the on-site laboratory for testing the river’s water.\nAdvertisement\nThe CM expressed satisfaction over the quality of Yamuna water based on the laboratory’s report, which operates under the Treatment Plant and Quality Control Wing of the Delhi Jal Board.\nAdvertisement\nGupta informed that continuous monitoring of Yamuna’s water quality is being carried out, and presently the phosphate level in the river, which is the main cause of froth formation, has now been recorded at only 0.2, whereas froth starts forming when this level exceeds 2 points.\nShe claimed that the ammonia levels in the river water have also come down significantly.\nThe CM has also clarified that defoamers and other chemical processes being used for controlling froth in the Yamuna are completely eco-friendly and certified.\nAll these chemicals, she said, are entirely safe for the environment, aquatic plants, and aquatic organisms.\nAccording to the CM, the Delhi government strictly adheres to transparency and safety standards at every step.\nShe warned that any kind of negligence with regard to transparency and safety standards in the work will not be tolerated.\nAs per the CM, in the same area, until last year, froth up to one meter would accumulate, which forced Chhath devotees to perform their rituals amid pollution.\nThe CM claimed that Yamuna’s water is now visibly clean and free of froth at present, and the Delhi government has ensured that this year’s Chhath Puja can be celebrated in a grand manner.\nGupta also shared that the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level in the Yamuna river water on Thursday was found to be 4.0 milligrams per liter, which she said is sufficient for the river, and suitable for the survival of aquatic organisms.\nAccording to the CM, if this level drops to 2 or below, it poses a threat to both the Yamuna and its aquatic life.\nShe said there was a time when the oxygen level in the Yamuna had fallen below zero, making it impossible for any aquatic organism to survive.\nThe present situation and the improvement visible presently has been made possible due to continuous desilting, revival of modern Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), and tapping of drains across Delhi, Gupta said.\nShe further said that there are ‘certain people’ who are attempting to spread misleading information regarding the condition of the Yamuna, which she said must be avoided.\nThe CM was accompanied by Delhi’s Minister of Development and Tourism, Kapil Mishra during the inspection.\nThe ministers have appreciated work done by the officers and employees of the Delhi Jal Board and the Environment Department, acknowledging that hundreds of them are working day and night for cleaning of the Yamuna.\nGupta has said this effort is not just the government’s initiative, but a collective campaign to rejuvenate the Yamuna with the cooperation of Delhi’s citizens.\nAdvertisement",
