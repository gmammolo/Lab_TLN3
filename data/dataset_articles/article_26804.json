  "text": "Private sector driving food security and profitable agribusiness\n- The World Food Day theme highlights the necessity of collaborative efforts among stakeholders for resilient food systems.\n- Kenchic PLC integrates smallholder farmers by providing resources and support, fostering supply chain consistency.\n- The Mtani Butchery initiative focuses on expanding market presence by meeting consumer needs in urban settings.\n- Poultry is presented as an affordable, high-protein dietary option, especially in the Kenyan context.\n- Kenchic’s business strategy incorporates a dual focus on market expansion and sustainability.\nIn a compelling discussion on CNBC Africa, Philip Maina, Chief Commercial Officer of Kenchic PLC, shed light on the role of the private sector in fostering food security, sustainable agribusiness, and farmer empowerment in Kenya’s thriving poultry sector. As the world observes World Food Day under the theme 'Hand in Hand for Better Foods and a Better Future,' Maina emphasized the significance of collaboration across various stakeholders, including private enterprises, government, and local communities.\nMaina underscored the symbolic importance of this year’s World Food Day theme, particularly the phrase 'hand in hand,' which highlights collaboration as a crucial pillar in establishing resilient food systems. These systems are essential for ensuring that access to nutrition is not a privilege but a basic right accessible across diverse markets. In regions like Africa, where malnutrition remains a persistent issue, such partnerships are integral to building food security.\nKenchic PLC, a leader in Kenya's poultry sector, exemplifies how private entities can balance commercial growth with commitments to affordability and support for smallholder farmers. Maina disclosed that Kenchic’s business model is rooted in enabling shared prosperity through sustainable food production—a mission the company fervently believes in and practices.\nIntegrating smallholder farmers into the business framework has been pivotal for Kenchic. The company’s investments in these farmers span providing access to vital farm inputs, offering technological support, and advising on sustainable practices, enhancing the consistency and predictability of their supply chain. This approach not only reduces wastage but also enhances product quality, driving brand trust and consumer confidence.\nOn the financial front, Maina kept specific metrics under wraps but affirmed that the strategy of engaging local farmers has long-term benefits, significantly influencing market presence and profitability. Kenchic’s unique approach involves careful market expansion through their Mtani Butchery initiative, targeting peri-urban and urban settlements to meet evolving consumer preferences.\nThis endeavor aims to make diverse poultry products readily accessible to consumers in these neighborhoods, responding to culinary habits and protein needs at various meals. Maina highlighted that poultry offers a substantial protein source, with 31 grams per 100 grams of chicken breast—an affordable option compared to other proteins like beef or fish, particularly in the Kenyan market.\nKenchic’s business strategy illustrates a dual-pronged focus on market expansion and sustainability. By bringing poultry products closer to consumers, the company not only expands its market footprint but also commits to sustainability and risk management—critical components in today’s business environment.\nIn conclusion, Philip Maina’s insights during the CNBC interview underscored Kenchic’s strategic endeavors to align with global food day objectives through innovation, collaboration, and sustainable practices in Kenya’s agribusiness sector. As Maina articulates, 'hand in hand' collaboration is the cornerstone of a resilient, food-secure future.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nDAILY UPDATE\nGet the best of CNBC Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news, insights and updates from experts across the continent.\nLoading security verification...\nGet this delivered to your inbox, and more info about our products and services.
