The annual Best of Florida Awards, presented by The Guide to Florida, highlight favorite businesses across the state based on statewide voting combined with editors’ picks—making this honor a true reflection of client satisfaction and industry excellence.\nFrom full-scale remodels and impact-rated windows and doors to custom closets, flooring, and window treatments, these sister companies create homes that reflect what matters most to their owners—combining elegant design with resilient, easy-to-maintain materials.\n“Our clients tell us the best part isn’t just the finished project—it’s the peace of mind along the way,” said Eric Bertram, COO. “Remodeling should feel exciting, not overwhelming.

Fabulous job.”\nGiving back is also part of the blueprint. The companies support F.I.S.H. of Sanibel & Captiva, the Sanibel Community House, and Hope for Children of Southwest Florida with time, materials, and financial resources. From hurricane-recovery assistance to support for Veterans, the team views community impact as inseparable from business success.\nAbout Beach Floor & Decor and Beach Breeze Builders\nA trusted name for more than 40 years, Beach Floor & Decor specializes in flooring, window treatments, furnishings, and interior design solutions that bring coastal sophistication home.
