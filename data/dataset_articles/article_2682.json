  "text": "A serial shoplifter who fronted court over six separate matters has been ordered to pay back hundreds of dollars for the items he stole.\nWest Dubbo man Jayden McKellar, 27, appeared at Dubbo Local Court via video link from prison on Wednesday, April 2, to be sentenced over a number of larceny and shoplifting matters.\nAccording to court documents, McKellar has been charged almost 100 times before for stealing, trespassing, breaching AVOs and more.\nOn his most recent court appearance, he faced four separate larceny charges, one shoplifting charge and one trespass charge.\nThe \"most serious\" of the matters, the court heard, was from September 12, 2024, when McKellar went into Myer on Macquarie Street and stole a number of menswear items.\nHe first picked up a backpack valued at $139 and then started filling the backpack with different items as he moved around the section. The total value of the items he took was $868.55.\nA staff member saw McKellar carrying the backpack with the security tag still on it as he made his way towards the back exit of the store. The staff member approached him and asked to see inside the bag but McKellar refused and started shouting at them.\nThe tag on the bag set off the scanners as McKellar ran out of the store through the carpark.\nDays earlier, McKellar also made off with a haul of clothing from Rebel Sports on Macquarie Street.\nAt about 11.45am on September 2, McKellar went into the store's change room with a number of clothing items valued at a total of $434.\nFive minutes later, McKellar left the changing room carrying a black Coles bag that he didn't have when he went into the changing room. Seeing this, an employee attempted to stop McKellar to speak with him, however he ignored their requests and left the store.\nOther matters included McKellar stealing an ice-cream from a sushi restaurant and stealing cash from a chemist.\nMagistrate Aaron Tang convicted McKellar of all the charges and said considering the number of matters, the threshold for imprisonment was crossed.\nFor stealing from Myer and Rebel Sports, he was sentenced to two fixed terms in prison of three months and two months, respectively. Taking into account the time served, McKellar was eligible for release on his sentence date.\nHe was also placed on a two-year community corrections order for stealing cash from the chemist and must get drug and alcohol counselling.\nTributes & Funerals Notices\nMore Tributes & Funerals Notices",
