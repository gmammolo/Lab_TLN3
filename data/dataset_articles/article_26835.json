  "text": "By Myriam Toua Chloe Dobinson Rob Currell ,\n16 minutes ago A simple vegetable that's readily available in the US is packing a protein punch , with nearly triple the amount found in an egg. Protein is a crucial macronutrient, playing a key role in cell function, supporting our immune system, and keeping our muscles and bones healthy.\nHigh-protein diets are well-known for boosting health and aiding weight management, and one plant-based food that's brimming with protein is edamame, young soybeans harvested before they ripen. When we think of protein, many of us immediately picture animal products like meat or eggs.\nEggs , in particular, are a popular pick for those looking to diversify their protein sources without relying too heavily on meat, according to the New York Post.\nREAD MORE: Storing bananas in one spot keeps them firm and ripe for '2 weeks'\nREAD MORE: Salmon is juicier and tastier when coated in 1 loving ingredient\nHowever, nutrition experts recommend including a variety of protein sources in your meals for balanced nutrition and to keep your diet varied and interesting, reports the Washington Post.\nA single large egg delivers 6.3 grams of protein, which is about 13% of the recommended daily value (DV) based on a 2,000-calorie diet, reports the Mirror .\nIn contrast, a single cup of edamame provides a whopping 18.4 grams of protein, equivalent to nearly three eggs.\nImportantly, edamame is a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids, making it a fantastic choice for vegetarians and vegans.\nEdamame has humble origins, dating back to Japan's Edo period from 1603 to 1868, where it was a simple snack for farmers.\n\"Edamame\" actually translates to \"bean branch,\" a nod to the traditional method of selling soybeans while still on their stalks.\nThese days, edamame remains a staple in Japanese izakayas (pubs), typically served boiled and salted, making it the perfect accompaniment to a cold beer or shochu.\nThe humble green bean has secured its spot on the global culinary stage due to its versatility and health benefits.\nIt can be found boiled, steamed, roasted, or mixed into various dishes like salads and stir-fries.\nCulinary wizards have embraced edamame, incorporating it creatively into their dishes - take Iron Chef's Edward Lee with his edamame hummus and Asian twist on succotash, or Rachel Walker who crafted a stunning edamame salad paired with black rice and yuzu dressing.\nFor all the latest news straight to your inbox, sign up for our FREE newsletters here .\nThe rise in edamame's popularity in Western cuisine followed the sushi trend of the '80s and continued into the early 2000s as its health benefits became widely recognized.\nIts appeal isn't just limited to health enthusiasts; it's even made its way into catchy tunes like the viral hit \"Edamame.\"\nWhether enjoyed as a simple snack or incorporated into more elaborate culinary creations, edamame is proof that plant-based foods can be both nutritious and delicious, cementing its place in international cuisine.\nFor the latest local news and features on Irish America, visit our homepage here .",
