  "text": "Ahmedabad: Gujarat , along with Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan , has emerged as one of the front-runners in “climate readiness” among India’s ten highest greenhouse gas emitting states, according to a new report by advisory firm IPE Global .\nThe report states, “Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat lead the way: three of India’s top ten emitting states are now ranked higher in the Climate Readiness Index. Tamil Nadu , Odisha , Uttar Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , West Bengal , and Maharashtra need to fast-track their low-carbon transition pathways.”\nThe findings are based on the Climate Readiness Index (CRI) , a benchmarking framework that evaluates states’ preparedness for low-carbon growth through 72 indicators across three pillars: systemic, financial, and technological readiness.\n“Climate Readiness Index provides a data-driven reflection of India’s climate preparedness at the state level—where ambition meets evidence,” said Abinash Mohanty , Global Sector Head for Climate Change and Sustainability Practice at IPE Global and the author of the study.\n“While a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat stand out with strong governance and enabling policy ecosystems, many others are held back by fragmented financing, limited technology adoption, and weak institutional capacity,” he added.\nMohanty also clarified that the index does not deeply assess other environmental aspects such as air and water quality, land impacts, or biodiversity concerns linked to renewable energy projects.\nIt is noteworthy that Gujarat leads with 48% of India’s solar manufacturing and 35% of solar park capacity, while Rajasthan tops in installed solar capacity at 21,347.58 MW. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh shows strong financial commitment to renewable energy investments, followed closely by Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, the report added. DeshGujarat",
