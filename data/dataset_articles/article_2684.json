  "text": "Report shows Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum fire and safety violations\nAMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - Since the announcement of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum closing on March 24, we have obtained the report that led to that closure.\nThe 52 page report outlines the violations that the State Fire Marshal’s Office found during the January inspection.\nSome of the issues range from minor infractions to others that could be considered more severe.\nExposed wiring was located in numerous areas throughout the building. Some light fixtures were found hanging by the wires.\nThe ceiling in the IT room was found to be damaged with more exposed wiring.\nInvestigators found an electrical panel with circuit breakers tied together using copper wire.\nThey also report excessive amounts of combustibles stored throughout the structure.\nSome safety concerns were also noted, stating the excessive length it would take visitors to reach an exit during an emergency.\nCopyright 2025 KFDA.
