  "text": "Brand Connect Initiative- 3 min read\nMountain shadows resorts: A model of eco-sensitive and disaster-resilient architecture in Wayanad\nMountain Shadows Resort in Wayanad exemplifies eco-sensitive and disaster-resilient design, blending seamlessly with its lake island setting through stilted structures and ecological restoration. Prakriti Aawaas in Kochi revolutionizes eco-friendly living, merging architecture with nature on a 2-acre site, fostering community and ecological well-being through sustainable design and traditional inspiration.\nMountain Shadows Resorts in Wayanad is an exemplary model of eco-sensitive and disaster-resilient design that redefines how architecture coexists with nature. Located on an island within the breathtaking\nThe design began with an extensive ecological study—analyzing topography, slopes, drainage, soil, and micro-climate—to guide every decision on site planning. Buildings were designed as small, stilted structures to minimize land disturbance, maintain natural surface runoff, and reduce the risk of landslides common in Wayanad’s hill terrain. The originally barren site underwent an ecological restoration using native species from the Nilgiri Biosphere, bringing back biodiversity and attracting birds and butterflies.\nEach cottage and its private pool were positioned after detailed visual studies to capture uninterrupted views of the lake while ensuring privacy. Vehicular access is limited to the entry point, with electric buggies navigating the winding, minimally paved paths through restored greenery. The main block sits atop the ridge, offering panoramic 360-degree views of the lake and surrounding mountains, with restaurants and banquet halls strategically oriented toward the most striking vistas. The resort’s signature infinity pool, perched along the ridge edge, captures the lake and sky in surreal reflections, making it a defining visual experience.\nArchitecturally, the resort draws inspiration from Wayanad’s tribal vernacular—employing mud, bamboo, thatch, and wood to create an aesthetic that resonates with the landscape. Natural materials, earthy textures, and handcrafted interiors evoke warmth and authenticity while remaining environmentally responsible.\nMountain Shadows stands as a revolutionary model in eco-sensitive and\nPrakriti Aawaas revolutionises eco-friendly living in Kerala by seamlessly merging architecture with the natural landscape. Designed on a tranquil 2-acre site, the layout is meticulously planned by studying the site’s contours and integrating natural drainage, ensuring every villa sits harmoniously within its environment.\nRooted in the philosophy of living with nature, the project responds to the modern urge to reconnect with the outdoors amid increasingly artificial urban lives. The planning, design, materials, and technology all align with this vision to create homes that breathe with their environment rather than stand apart from it.\nOrganised around a central community zone with a clubhouse, pool, event spaces, and a landscaped terrace garden, Prakriti Aawaas nurtures social interaction and a strong sense of community. Residential clusters radiate from this green core, integrating private gardens with communal open spaces to evoke the feeling of a natural sanctuary. Sustainability is embedded in its architecture — through natural ventilation, eco-friendly materials, and landscape details that enhance oxygen levels and biodiversity. Drawing inspiration from Kerala’s traditional timber architecture and tropical gardens, the development reinterprets local heritage for a modern context.\nPrakriti Aawaas sets a new benchmark by uniting function, aesthetics, environmental quality, and economic sense. This project is not just a collection of homes; it is a transformative model for living with nature, offering a sanctuary that nurtures both community and ecological well-being.\n(Brand Connect Initiative)\nBanasura Sagar Lake, the resort blends seamlessly into its surroundings through thoughtful planning, sustainable materials, and a deep respect for the site’s ecology.The design began with an extensive ecological study—analyzing topography, slopes, drainage, soil, and micro-climate—to guide every decision on site planning.
