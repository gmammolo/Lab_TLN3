  "text": "MIAMI – A student from Massachusetts told Miami police officers that she used the Nextdoor app to connect with her roommates from hell in Little Havana, according to a police arrest report.\nThe student reported she moved into the Riverside-area apartment in March and was sharing it with Suejona Mia and Sabrina Bouchard when there was an eviction notice weeks later, according to the police report.\nRecommended Videos\nThe student, who was subleasing, reported Bouchard, 27, and Mia, 23, who were on the lease, told her they wanted her to move out and declined to give her a pro-rated refund, according to the report.\nOn Wednesday night, the victim told a police officer that Bouchard “straddled her and pressed her against her bed” while Mia “snatched” her keys from her hand, according to the police report.\nRecords show the student told a police officer that she was in pain when she called 911 for help, police officers detained the two women, and a detective in the robbery unit questioned them.\nAccording to a police report, Bouchard and Mia both denied the accusations and said the victim “threw the keys” at Bouchard and denied causing the victim the “abrasion” on her hand.\nInmate records show correctional deputies booked Mia and Bouchard shortly after 2:35 a.m., on Wednesday at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Both faced charges of strongarm robbery and their bond was $1,000 each.\nCopyright 2025 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.",
