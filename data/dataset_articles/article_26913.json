  "text": "The 2025 olive harvest season in Sfax will officially begin on October 29, 2025, and continue until April 15, 2026. The season is marked by optimistic forecasts, with an expected olive production of 515,000 tons, which translates to about 180,000 tons of pure olive oil. This year is shaping up to be a remarkable one for the regional olive economy.\nA Preparatory Meeting to Ensure a Smooth Harvest Season\nOn October 15, 2025, a coordination meeting was held at the Sfax Governorate, bringing together key sector stakeholders, including farmers, mill owners, and representatives from agricultural and security services. The goal was to discuss practical measures to ensure the success of this harvest season while creating a favorable framework for all participants.\nAfter extensive discussions, the price for harvesting olives was set between 350 and 400 millimes per kilogram, with a maximum price for oil extraction set at 200 millimes per kilogram. Although mill owners initially proposed a price of 250 millimes, a consensus was reached to maintain a reasonable and balanced price for both producers and consumers.\nThe Strategic Importance of Olive Harvesting in Sfax\nThe Governor of Sfax, Mohamed Hajri, emphasized the strategic importance of the olive sector for the region. It is not only a major economic driver for Sfax but also for Tunisia as a whole. Olive harvesting is a crucial sector that directly impacts local development, creating opportunities for farmers and local businesses.\nDuring the meeting, it was confirmed that all necessary conditions would be implemented to ensure a smooth harvest season while safeguarding the interests of farmers and olive oil producers.\nGoal: A Successful Harvest for All Sector Stakeholders\nThe olive sector in Sfax, considered one of the most important in the country, receives special attention every year due to its direct impact on both the local and national economy. This season, the authorities aim to ensure not only fair and equitable pricing but also optimal working conditions for those involved in the production chain.\nWith promising harvest forecasts, the Sfax region is expected to experience a positive economic dynamic and continued growth in the olive sector, a key factor in the country’s prosperity.\nWhat's happening in Tunisia?\nSubscribe to our Youtube channel for updates.",
