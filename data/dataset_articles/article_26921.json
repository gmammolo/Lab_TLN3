  "text": "BENIDORM’S Terra Natura park has opened a solar power plant capable of generating over 1,000 kW clean energy.\nThe park says it is a major step towards becoming energy self-sufficient and will reduce CO2 emissions by over 500 tonnes per yer.\nThe project has cost over €700,000- helped by a grant from the Valencian government.\nThe facility has 1,797 solar panels distributed over a total area of 4,700 square metres, broken down into 3,500 m2 in the car park and 1,200 m2 on roofs.\nTerra Natura manager, Luis Perea, said: “We are taking another step towards a greener future as we move forward with the aim of being a benchmark for conservation, education and sustainable leisure.”\n“We are backing on renewable energies and continuous improvement,” he added.\nThe plant was constructed by Grupotec, a major company in the clean energy, architecture and industrial engineering sector, with a track record in national and international solar energy projects.\nThe project involving Terra Natura Benidorm, Grupotec and the Valencian government is seen as a positive public-private partnership model to accelerate clean energy usage in tourist and leisure venues.\nClick here to read more Benidorm News from The Olive Press.",
