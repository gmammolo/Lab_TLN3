  "text": "April 9, 2025\nMan fined $2000 for carrying ratchet knife\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — A man who was caught in possession of a ratchet knife was fined $2,000 on Tuesday after pleading guilty to carrying an offensive weapon in the Kingston and St Andrew Parish Court.\nAdmitting to the offence, Lloyd Beckford told presiding Judge Peter Wilson that he had an explanation. When asked why he had the ratchet knife in his pocket, Beckford explained that he was just carrying it while driving home from work.\nHowever, the judge dismissed his explanation and imposed a fine of $2,000 or a 10-day prison sentence.\nJudge Wilson then asked Beckford, “What you learn from this?” to which Beckford replied he would refrain from repeating the offence.",
