  "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nThursday, October 15th, 2025\nEllsworth Secures Key Land Acquisitions and DEP Approval for Merrill Lane Extension to New Courthouse\nLandmark acquisitions and environmental permit clearance set stage for $55 million Hancock County Courthouse that will help enhance urban infrastructure supporting growth, housing, recreation, and economic development.\nEllsworth, ME – The City of Ellsworth today announced that all land acquisitions and transfers necessary for the construction of the Merrill Lane extension have been finalized, and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and Bureau of Land Resources have approved permits for the project. The extension will serve as the primary access road to the new $55 million Hancock County Courthouse, a transformative investment in the region’s future.\n“This milestone reflects the power of partnership,” said City Manager Charlie Pearce. “With the current courthouse having been at the heart of Ellsworth for more than the last 100 years, we are fortunate to have private landowners, businesses, community leaders, and our state partners working together. Their cooperation, along with the judiciary’s patience, ensures that this project will support our city’s growth and vitality for generations to come.”\nSeveral Ellsworth families and businesses made pivotal contributions to the project.\nThe Wardwell family enabled the relocation of the courthouse through a landmark 17.9-acre land swap with the Maine Judicial Branch. They also gifted a portion of additional land for the road to the City of Ellsworth at no cost. “This was about more than just land,” the Wardwells explained. “It was about creating a better future for Ellsworth – strengthening our urban center and opening the door to housing and recreation opportunities for generations to come.”\nThe Adams family, long known for their multi-generational businesses in Ellsworth, transferred a key parcel of land to the City to allow the road extension to move forward. “My family has always believed in giving back to Ellsworth,” said Troy Adams. “Helping make way for this courthouse is part of that tradition – supporting progress while ensuring that Ellsworth remains a strong and vibrant place for business and community life.”\nThe Merrill family, owners of Merrill Furniture (one of Ellsworth’s oldest continuously operating family businesses) played a critical role in negotiating both with family members and multiple corporate leaseholders. “This was not a simple process, but it was worth it,” said Bob Merrill. “Our family, alongside our business partners, recognized how important this project is for Ellsworth. We’re proud to have done our part in helping the community move forward.”\nThe City also expressed thanks to KeyBank, L.L. Bean, the Ellsworth City Council, Acadia Law Group and attorney Alison King, and legislative leaders Representative Russ White and Senator Nicole Grohoski, whose guidance, adjustments, legal expertise, and support made the project possible.\nWork on the Merrill Lane extension is already underway. Over the coming weeks, crews will complete surveying, boundary marking, and initial site clearing, with road base preparation scheduled through October. By the end of this month, the final design for the permanent road will also be complete, setting the stage for the next phase of work. In 2026, a construction access road and temporary power will be in place, ensuring the courthouse site is ready for the Judicial Branch to begin its build-out. Upon conclusion of the construction access road and final design specs the city will look to put out to private bid on the final road construction effort to be completed by 2028 per the city’s agreement with the judiciary. Our legislative partners have also put forward a bill requesting additional cost sharing from the state on the road project.\nBroader Impact\nThe courthouse relocation and Merrill Lane extension are expected to deliver benefits far beyond the judicial system. By opening up new land for development, the project creates opportunities for additional housing construction and the potential establishment of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts to support Ellsworth’s long-term commercial and residential growth needs. At the same time, it will potentially establish the City’s first public parking area for the Downeast Sunrise Trail, nearly 100 miles in length and already a major draw for ATV riders, cyclists, and walkers throughout the region.\nEqually significant, the new road will improve recreational access to the Card Brook wilderness, a hidden gem just steps from Ellsworth’s urban core. Residents and visitors may soon be able to enjoy walking trails that feel far removed from the bustle of downtown, in one of Maine’s most beautiful natural areas.\n“Ellsworth is growing rapidly, and projects like this set the standard for how we plan for the future,” Lyons said. “The courthouse and Merrill Lane extension create more than just a road – they create space for new housing, commercial investment, and enhanced recreational access. Thanks to the dedication of city staff, the judiciary, local families, and businesses we’re being intentional about how we develop our urban core, ensuring that the city meets current needs while preparing opportunities for generations to come.”",
