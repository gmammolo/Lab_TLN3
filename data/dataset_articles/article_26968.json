  "text": "Australian mining magnate Gina Rinehart\nis expanding her exposure to Brazilian rare earths ventures while Australia -listed Brazilian Rare Earths has secured a decade-long supply agreement, BNamericas reported. The moves underscore increasing global efforts to reduce reliance on China -dominated supply chains.\nAustralian-listed explorer St George Mining disclosed plans raise AUD72.5mn ( $50mn ) to fund its niobium and rare earths venture, Araxá, located in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state.\nThe capital will be secured through a private share placement, with two-thirds of the offering to be taken up by major US and European funds, as well as domestic institutions and current shareholders.\nThe remaining third will be acquired by Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd , a company controlled by Rinehart, as per BNamericas reporting.\nSeparately, Brazilian Rare Earths Limited , in which Rinehart holds a 5% stake, obtained firm commitments for a private share placement targeting AUD120mn in proceeds.\nThe company said the capital will be deployed to accelerate development of high-grade rare earths ventures in Brazil and shorten the implementation schedule for an integrated rare earths separation refinery planned for Camaçari, in Bahia state.\nMeanwhile, the same firm announced it has signed agreements with Carester SAS for the supply of heavy rare earths feedstocks over an initial period of ten years, Mining.com reported.\nCarester will also provide engineering and technical services for Brazilian Rare Earths' planned separation plant at the Camaçari Petrochemical Complex .\nThe processor will purchase a maximum of 150 tonnes per annum of contained dysprosium and terbium from Brazilian Rare Earths over the ten-year term. The two critical minerals are essential for the production of high-performance permanent magnets.\n'Teaming with Carester gives us the technical depth and downstream capacity to rapidly convert our ultra high-grade rare earths into the vital products customers need,' said Bernardo da Veiga\n, CEO of Brazilian Rare Earths , as quoted by Mining.com. Carester is constructing a rare earth separation and recycling plant which has received backing of over €216mn ( $251.25mn ) from the French government and Japanese entities.\nRinehart's involvement in Brazilian ventures underscores a wider pattern in the nation's mining sector, where early-stage ventures are securing funding more readily from international rather than domestic investors.\n'As project financiers, we've started to look more closely at critical minerals. However, there are some challenges when it comes to financing this segment, especially from the perspective of local banks,' said Marcelo Girão, head of project finance at Itaú BBA, the investment banking arm of Brazilian banking major Itaú Unibanco.\n'First, it's a dollarised sector, which limits the appetite of these local institutions. Second, mining is highly volatile in terms of prices, which causes some hesitation among banking financiers. Because of this, early-stage projects are mainly financed by investors already familiar with the risks in this segment,' he added, as quoted by BNamericas.\nBrazil holds estimated reserves of 21mn metric tonnes of rare earths, second only to China's 44mn tonnes. However, Brazil's domestic production remains minimal, totalling just 20 tonnes in 2024, a tiny fraction of the 390,000 tonnes produced globally.\n© 2025 bne IntelliNews, source Magazine\n© Acquiremedia - 2025",
