  "text": "Instabee Group has received a Science Based Targets initiative validation that confirms that our targets are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement — limiting global warming to well below 2°C and ideally to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Setting targets based on the latest climate science reflects our ambition to be a leading logistics player in reducing emissions.\nOur approved targets cover both direct and indirect emissions and state:\nInstabee Group AB commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 51.4% by 2030, from a 2022 base year. Instabee Group AB commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions by 51.6% per parcel delivered by 2030, from a 2022 base year*.\n“I'm really proud of this approval from the SBTi. It gives us a clear direction for the road ahead and confirms that we’re on the right track. We’re already fossil free in four of our six markets, and our box-delivery model is inherently efficient — each parcel in Sweden has a footprint of just 0.05 kg of CO2e.* Still, we never stop looking for ways to do better, and these targets help guide us as we keep raising the bar, says Alexis Priftis, CEO and founder of Instabee Group.”\nIn order to reach these targets we are focusing on four different areas:\n1. Shifting to fully fossil-free in all markets\nWe are already fossil-free in four of our six markets for internal and outsourced operations, and are transitioning the remaining two. During 2025 we have worked to shift courier companies in Denmark from diesel to biodiesel (HVO100), and from October we are now fossil-free across the entire delivery chain for box deliveries, from warehouse to locker.\nIncrease electrification\nWe are pursuing electrification efforts, making investments into our internal fleet as well as engaging with our courier companies to support their transition. At the same time, we are investing in our charging infrastructure at terminals. For example in Norway, we have increased from 60% electric home-deliveries to 87% this year.\nEfficiency improvements\nEfficiency is an area where we always challenge ourselves to improve, and where our advanced technology creates advantages. For example, we continuously improve our internal routing optimization software to ensure the smartest routes, thereby cutting distance and emissions. In addition, we are piloting new things, such as eco-driving with sensors that track fuel consumption and driving behaviour, and lighter parcel cages to enable improved fill rate in vehicles.\nReduction of non-transport emissions\nWhile transport naturally is the largest emission source for us as a logistics company, we must also reduce other emission sources. Our goal is to have 100% renewable electricity at terminals in 2030 and are reducing our footprint from capital goods by reusing components of sorting machines. Recently we’ve set up a sorting machine in Copenhagen that mainly is built by combining two disassembled machines.\nAbout the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global organization that defines and promotes best practices for setting science-based emissions reduction targets. It assesses and validates targets to ensure they are consistent with the latest climate science and aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. Through its framework and independent verification, the SBTi provides organisations with a clear and credible pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and drive meaningful climate action.\n* The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from biogenic feedstocks.\n*Well to wheel 8 (WTW) It includes the entire life cycle of a fuel, from its source extraction (\"Well\"), through its production and distribution (\"Well-to-Tank\"), and finally to its combustion in the vehicle (\"Tank-to-Wheel\").\nInstabee, with consumer-facing brands Budbee, Instabox, and Porterbuddy, was founded in 2022, but the collective experience dates back much further. Today, Instabee is present in six markets, serving thousands of online merchants and millions of consumers with easy home deliveries or convenient parcel locker deliveries, using the best fuel available. With smart tech, a focus on the environment, and a secure supply chain, Instabee has become the key partner of online merchants and the obvious choice for end-consumers, backed by notable investors such as Kinnevik, Creades, and EQT Ventures, among others.",
