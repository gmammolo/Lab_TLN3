  "text": "Wallace, Idaho--(Newsfile Corp. - October 16, 2025) - Americas Gold and Silver Corporation (TSX: USA) (NYSE American: USAS) (\"Americas\" or the \"Company\"), the only current U.S. antimony producer and a growing North American precious metals producer, is pleased to announce, for the first time under new management, both antimony and copper production for the first three quarters of 2025, detailed in the table below.\nQuarter Antimony (lbs) Copper (lbs) Sb:Cu Ratio Q1 2025 130,649 175,215 0.75 Q2 2025 173,393 239,949 0.72 Q3 2025 143,424 200,654 0.71 Total 447,466 615,817 0.73\nTable 1: Galena Complex Antimony (Sb) and Copper (Cu) Q1-Q3 2025 production results\nThe year-to-date antimony output of 447,466 pounds, alongside 615,817 pounds of copper, underscores Galena's strategic critical metals importance, with a consistent Sb:Cu ratio averaging approximately 0.73 - slightly above the historical 0.69-to-1 ratio resulting from previously announced test work results (see Americas news release dated September 8, 2025 , for more discussion on recovered metals in flotation concentrate).\nPaul Andre Huet, Chairman and CEO, commented: \" Highlighting Galena as the only producing antimony mine in the United States , I am thrilled to announce both antimony and copper production from our Galena Complex. Year-to-date we have produced 447,466 pounds of antimony and 615,817 pounds of copper.\nThis is the first time under our new management that we are reporting antimony production, reflecting a new era where the antimony and copper from our tetrahedrite ore have the potential to drive significant future revenues.\nThe antimony production announced today has been delivered while we make investments into several growth projects at Galena to set the stage for future near term production growth. As we continue to execute this strategy to scale silver production materially by several multiples, potentially restoring historical production levels, we expect to concurrently increase antimony output. This is driven by our focus on increasing production of high-grade silver tetrahedrite ore, which is the primary host for antimony and copper at Galena. With our recently announced breakthrough of 99%+ antimony extraction from flotation concentrate grading approximately 19% antimony, and the potential to realize on commercial recovery and marketable antimony products that can be produced using proven metallurgical processes, we are in a very strong position to be a major supplier of critical metals that the United States needs.”\nAbout Ore at the Galena Complex\nThe Galena Complex primarily mines two types of ore from its underground veins in Idaho's Silver Valley: galena ore (a silver-lead ore) and tetrahedrite ore (a silver-copper-antimony ore). Galena ore, named after the mineral galena (PbS with silver inclusions), is the source of silver-lead concentrates and has historically dominated production with a historical output of over 240M ounces of silver and 1.7B pounds of lead. Tetrahedrite ore contains the sulfosalt mineral tetrahedrite ((Cu,Fe) 12 Sb 4 S 13 ), which hosts approximately 1% antimony along with copper and higher-grade silver compared to galena ore - enabling silver-copper-antimony concentrates with a typical Sb:Cu ratio of ~0.69:1, as recently confirmed by test work completed and announced on September 8, 2025. This polymetallic tetrahedrite has been the subject of recent breakthroughs, such as 99%+ antimony extraction from flotation concentrate grading approximately 19% antimony, positioning Galena as the only current U.S. antimony producer.\nAbout Americas Gold and Silver Corporation\nAmericas Gold & Silver is a growing precious metals and antimony mining company with multiple assets in North America. In December 2024, Americas increased its ownership in the Galena Complex (Idaho, USA) from 60% to 100% in a transaction with Eric Sprott, solidifying its position as a growing silver and antimony producer. Americas also owns and operates the Cosalá Operations in Sinaloa, Mexico. Eric Sprott is the Company's largest shareholder, holding an approximate 20% interest. Americas has a proven and experienced management team led by Paul Huet, is fully funded to execute its growth plans, and focused on becoming one of the top North American silver and antimony mining companies.\nFor More Information:\nMaxim Kouxenko - Manager, Investor Relations\nM: +1 (647) 888-6458\nE: ir@americas-gold.com\nW: Americas-gold.com\nTechnical Information and Qualified Persons\nThe scientific and technical information relating to the Company's material mining properties contained herein has been reviewed and approved by Rick Streiff, Executive Vice President - Geology of the Company.
