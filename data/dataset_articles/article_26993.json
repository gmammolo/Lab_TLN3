  "text": "If you’ve spent any time reading about the German automobile industry, you’ve probably heard the name Jürgen Resch. Resch is the head of a non-profit organization called Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), or Environmental Action Germany. He made headlines in 2018 after his organization sued automakers to hold them accountable for a ban on diesel cars in the country’s most polluted cities, and was among the first to take Volkswagen to court over its infamous diesel scandal.\nThese days, the DUH is focused on enforcing the EU’s upcoming ban on the sale of gas- and diesel-powered cars, while also holding companies throughout Germany accountable for stuff like “greenwashing,” a practice in which corporations tout their products as environmentally beneficial when, in many cases, they are not.\nTo give you an idea of the DUH’s goals, it sued Mercedes-Benz a few years back, accusing the brand “of infringing on people’s freedoms by exacerbating climate change,” according to Reuters. The suit demanded that Mercedes adhere to tighter emissions goals and commit to ending production of ICE-powered vehicles by 2030. The lawsuit was dropped in 2022, but the DUH plans to appeal that decision.\nThe DUH regularly tests cars to see if they hold up to their fuel consumption and emissions claims with the help of Axel Friedrich, an environmentalist who spent time at Germany’s Umwelt Bundesamt (UBA), the country’s federal environmental agency. German publication Manager Magazin describes him in a particularly threatening light:\nAxel Friedrich (77), a former department head at the Federal Environment Agency, regularly measures everything that can be measured for environmental protection organizations, including the German Environmental Aid. He examines cars and cruise ships for their pollutant emissions. He is considered by the media to be an “emissions hunter” or “the scourge of the auto industry.”\nAccording to Manager Magazin, Mercedes was understandably nervous about supplying a CLA to the DUH for testing purposes. The company claims the CLA can hit 12.2 kWh/100 km (5.09 miles/kWh), making it the most efficient EV in Europe. Any results differing from that would cast doubt on the company’s reputation and risk losing that highly desired EV efficiency crown. But reportedly, the car performed exactly as it was supposed to. From Manager Magazin:\nFriedrich drove kilometer after kilometer over three days, achieving a reading of 12.22 for the CLA. The car lived up to its promise. The on-road results matched—something truly rare—the manufacturer’s lab values.\nResch couldn’t or didn’t want to believe this. He reportedly asked Friedrich to subsequently test various versions of the Tesla electric benchmark. He also tested Model 3 models, but the CLA remained the most fuel-efficient. According to those close to him, Friedrich raved about the CLA, saying the Mercedes was the best electric car he’d ever driven.\nAt this point, you’d think Resch would make the results public, confirming Mercedes’ claims and reaffirming the CLA’s position as the most efficient electric car on the market right now. Except that’s not what happened, according to Manager Magazin:\nBut unlike usual, Resch remained silent afterward. The DUH did not publish the positive result for Mercedes. Mercedes also remained silent—although they would, of course, have liked to make the test results public.\nResch says he disliked the idea that Mercedes might use the measurement results to advertise under the label of Deutsche Umwelthilfe. He also doesn’t know whether the CLA provided by Mercedes was actually a production model or an improved version for the tests. Mercedes dismissed Resch’s concerns, saying the CLA provided was a production vehicle.\nThese are fair points from Resch. You wouldn’t want your independent non-profit to look like it’s promoting a company it’s actively in the process of suing. And there’s no way of telling whether the car tested was a pure production spec (I don’t think Mercedes is stupid enough to do this, but other manufacturers have in the past, so it can’t be dismissed entirely).\nTo me, it sounds like the DUH wanted to tack on a “gotcha” moment to an electric car maker in the hopes that the results would hold the manufacturer more accountable. Except, the results were reportedly better than expected, so the DUH decided to drop the whole thing and move on. Whether any of this is actually true is anyone’s guess; I’ve reached out to the DUH and Mercedes for comment. Until then, Mercedes’ official efficiency data still stands.\nSupport our mission of championing car culture by becoming an Official Autopian Member.",
