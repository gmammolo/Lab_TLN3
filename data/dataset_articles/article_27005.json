AGUP2 aims to process oil and associated gas from the Ratawi oil field to increase production capacity to 210,000 barrels per day of oil and 154 million standard cubic feet per day of gas while striving to eliminate routine flaring and contributing to Iraq’s low-carbon energy transition.\nThe GGIP is designed to enhance the development of Iraq’s natural resources to improve the country’s electricity supply. This 4-in-1 multi-energy project comprises the recovery of gas that is currently flared at three oil fields in southern Iraq to supply electric power plants, the redevelopment of the Ratawi oil field, the construction of a 1 GWac (1.25GWp) solar farm and of a seawater treatment plant.\nVallourec had already supplied, for the drilling of the first 30 wells, around 15,000 tonnes of casing and tubing with VAM® connections. For this new phase, it will deliver more than 30,000 tons of premium tubular solutions, including approximately 3,000 tons of Premium Line Pipe products with anti-corrosion coating.\nGroup Chairman and CEO Philippe Guillemot commented: “We are proud to continue our collaboration with TotalEnergies on this flagship project in Iraq. Since the beginning of the project, Vallourec has been fully committed to supporting TotalEnergies. This new phase confirms the strength of our long-standing partnership and our ability to deliver high-performance, reliable tubular solutions.”\nAbout Vallourec\nVallourec is a world leader in premium tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments, new generation power plants, challenging architectural projects, and high-performance mechanical equipment.
