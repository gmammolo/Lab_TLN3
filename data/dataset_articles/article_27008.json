  "text": "The Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank has awarded Jamestown a grant to develop a plan to help ensure the wastewater system remains resilient to climate change.\nThe grant for $27,500 is among $377,500 awarded to eight municipalities through the Community Project Assistance Fund.\nBill Fazioli, executive director of the Rhode Island Infrastructure Bank, said his agency hears from cities and towns “all the time that they need help getting key infrastructure projects off the ground with initial planning and technical assistance.”\n“That is why we created the Community Project Assistance Fund,” he said.\nAdded Vahid Ownjazayeri, chairman of the board of directors, “Infrastructure projects don’t happen without significant upfront investments in planning and engineering.”\nThe money will allow Jamestown’s engineering consultant, Weston & Sampson, to assess “current and projected impacts from natural hazards on critical components” of both the collection and treatment systems.\nThe plan, according to the application, will “provide and select adaptation methods to make the wastewater infrastructure resilient to sea-level rise and impacts to high natural hazard events.” All residents will benefit from having a plan to ensure the long-term operation of the system and its “critical infrastructure,” per the application.\nTown Administrator Ed Mello said the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management requires Jamestown to develop this plan.\nThis grant increases the amount the agency awarded Jamestown to $140,000; $112,500 was awarded in January to conduct a feasibility study related to public drinking water.\nThat study by Pare Corp. is expected to determine whether Jamestown can connect to other suppliers, such as North Kingstown or Providence Water. The study also considers the viability of municipal wells previously drilled “in terms of rate, quantify, permitting and treatment”; the practicality of using reverse osmosis as a water source; and an assessment of the physical and engineering limitations of the current distribution system, including the wells, pump stations, reservoirs, treatment plant and pipes.\nThe money, moreover, could be used for legal challenges related to regulating private wells. If both the public water system and private wells are being fed by the same aquifer, the study should determine whether water use could be legally restricted outside of the utility district.\n“That work is underway,” Mello said.",
