  "text": "Significantly reduce volatile organic compound emissions\\nReduce carbon emissions by reducing evaporation gases 사진 확대 KCC and HD announced on the 6th that they have jointly developed eco-friendly water-soluble ship paint technology in response to environmental regulations. <KCC>\nThe industry is developing eco-friendly paints to cope with the trend of gradually strengthening environmental regulations related to the shipbuilding industry.\nKCC announced on the 6th that it has jointly developed water-soluble ship paint technology with four HD Hyundai shipbuilding companies (HD Korea Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, HD Hyundai Mipo Shipbuilding, and HD Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries).\nThrough this joint development, KCC and HD Hyundai have released water-soluble rust preventive paints for non-invasive areas of ships and heat shielding and insulation paints for LNG carriers that are not submerged. Both products are applied with eco-friendly technologies that significantly reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions compared to existing solvent-type paints while maintaining existing performance.\nThe water-soluble rust preventive paint has a short drying time, increasing the efficiency of the work process. It is also characterized by significantly reducing the amount of VOC generated compared to the solvent type. Currently, KCC and HD Hyundai are preparing to commercialize the product with eco-friendly paint certification.\nThe blocking heat paint for LNG carriers developed by the two companies minimized the vaporization of LNG transported at ultra-low temperatures below minus 160 degrees Celsius. When external heat is introduced during the operation process, LNG is vaporized and boil-off gas (BOG) is generated, which leads to cargo loss and additional carbon emissions.\nThe newly developed paint blocks external radiant heat and reduces thermal conductivity to suppress the occurrence of BOG. As a result, it can reduce cargo losses and reduce carbon emissions.\nThe two companies evaluated that this cooperation laid the foundation for localization of water-soluble paint and blocking heat paint for ships.\nA KCC official said, \"The water-soluble paint for ships and the vehicle and insulation paint for LNG carriers are a new turning point in shipbuilding paint technology,\" adding, \"It will be an important technical foundation for securing global customer trust amid strengthened environmental regulations of the International Maritime Organization.\"\nAn official from HD Hyundai also said, \"We will strengthen ship competitiveness and lead the sustainable growth of the shipbuilding industry through cooperation between the two companies.\"",
