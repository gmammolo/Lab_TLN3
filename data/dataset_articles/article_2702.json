  "text": "NEW LONDON (WLUK) -- Protesters outside Tyson Foods in New London Wednesday morning voiced concerns over President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n“We are trying to call attention to the termination of the CHNV visa program,\" said protestor Emily Tseffos. \"There are a lot of folks in the New London area that are here, working, paying taxes, living, raising their families on this program, and they've been asked to self deport by April 24th.”\nOn March 25th, the Department of Homeland Security announced the President Biden-era 'Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program' would be terminated.\nThe program gives temporary legal status to 530,000 people in the US until 2026.\nEmily Tseffos told us the soon-to-be shut down system was effective and increased legal immigration.\n“We really just want those legal recourse options to be available to people,\" she said. \"When you're just cutting them off, you're forcing more people to immigrate. Its going to still happen, its going to be illegal now.”\nFOX 11 asked Republican Congressman Tony Wied for his thoughts on the termination of the program.\nIn a statement he said:\nThe Biden Administration purposely ended President Trump's effective immigration policies and enacted the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) program in an effort to conceal the severity of their disastrous open border policies by granting temporary amnesty to millions of illegal aliens coming from those countries in droves. The Biden Administration made it known at the time that these were temporary visas and were never meant to be permanent.\nProtester Marc Christopher told us if you're in the US -\n“You're our neighbor. We don't ask questions about how you came into the United States. Good people are good people, neighbors are neighbors, children are children, and we support them,\" he said.",
