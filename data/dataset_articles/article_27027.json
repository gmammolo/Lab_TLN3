  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 6): Ranhill SAJ Sdn Bhd, Johor’s sole water operator, said it supports the state government’s proposal to make Sungai Johor a permanent water catchment area.\nThe move follows recent supply disruption in the state due to raw water pollution. The recommendation would preserve and protect the raw water source for nearly two million users, Ranhill SAJ chief executive officer Anuar Abdul Ghani said in a statement on Thursday.\nPollution could threaten the operations of the four water treatment plants along Sungai Johor and disrupt water supply to consumers, he warned. “The gazettement of Sungai Johor as a permanent catchment area will serve as the main barrier in protecting the state’s water resources.”\nOn Oct 31, pollution detected in Sungai Johor halted the four treatment plants and caused nearly 300,000 user accounts to be affected, according to Ranhill SAJ, a unit of Ranhill Utilities Bhd (KL: RANHILL ).\nA ruptured sand-washing pond at an inland sand mining site in Kota Tinggi was to be blamed for the incident, according to the state government.\nMaking Sungai Johor a permanent catchment area would not only control development and industrial activities in the surroundings but also ensure that preventive and enforcement measures can be implemented more efficiently, Anuar said.\n“The issue of river pollution not only affects the environment but also threatens the well-being of the people,” he stressed. “It not only affects quality of life, but also hinders economic growth.”\nAnuar also called for strengthened integrated cooperation between the state government, enforcement agencies, local authorities and local communities to ensure rivers remain clean, safe and sustainable.\nThere are also another eight water treatment plants located within the Sungai Muar basin.\nShares of Ranhill were down three sen or 1.69% at RM1.75 at Thursday's noon break, valuing the group at RM2.27 billion.",
