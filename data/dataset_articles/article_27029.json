  "text": "A week after a sharp surge in agricultural fires, Punjab recorded a significant drop in stubble burning incidents on Wednesday, with fewer than 100 cases reported on the day of Gurpurab, which marks the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. According to a TOI report, just 94 farm fires were recorded across the state. The day’s numbers contributed to a season total of 2,933 incidents up to November 5, a figure that stands in stark contrast to the 4,755 cases reported by the same date last year and 17,403 in 2023, as per the data. This represents a reduction of nearly 40% compared to 2024 and a dramatic 83% decrease from the 2023 tally. The maximum impact of crop burning is generally witnessed between Nov 4 and Nov 8. However, due to floods in Punjab this monsoon, harvesting was delayed by a week. As a result, the maximum impact window is expected between Nov 6 and Nov 12. The decline occurred on a day when the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev, which include the revered phrase ‘Pavan guru pani pita mata dharat mahat’ (Air is the guru, water is the father and great earth is the mother), are often invoked to highlight the importance of protecting the natural elements from pollution. Sangrur remains most affected district While the overall numbers have fallen, the geographical spread of the issue remains wide. According to TOI, 22 of Punjab’s 23 districts have now reported at least one farm fire this season, with Ropar being the sole exception. Sangrur continues to be the epicentre of the problem, reporting 526 incidents so far this season, the highest of any district. It is closely followed by Tarn Taran with 509 cases. In the last 24 hours, 17 districts reported burning, with Moga recording the highest single-day count of 18 incidents. Punjab's AQI presents a mixed picture Air quality levels across Punjab’s cities on Wednesday presented a varied picture. While Ropar, which has reported no farm fires, recorded a comparatively moderate average PM 2.5 level of 74, other cities grappled with poorer air. Jalandhar, with 48 season-long fire incidents, saw an average PM 2.5 of 162, peaking at 277. Similarly, Amritsar (254 seasonal incidents) averaged 148 and Khanna saw a maximum reading of 319. Punjab's fires in a national context Data from the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modeling from Space (CREAMS) provides a broader national perspective. On Wednesday, a total of 382 stubble burning events were recorded across five states, with Madhya Pradesh now recording the highest single-day count of 131. Punjab's 94 incidents were followed by 74 in Uttar Pradesh, 70 in Rajasthan and 13 in Haryana. However, in the cumulative tally for the season up to November 5, Punjab's 2,933 incidents still far exceed those of other states, which include Uttar Pradesh (1,121), Rajasthan (882), Madhya Pradesh (753) and Haryana (171). Delhi has recorded just three such events.\",",
