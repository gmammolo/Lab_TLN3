  "text": "By Gurpreet Singh |November 6, 2025\nA tiny frog species whose fathers show extraordinary dedication to raising their offspring in rainforests.\nImage: Canva\nRanitomeya hwata is a small, brightly coloured frog found in South American tropical rainforests.\nImage: Canva\nUnlike many frogs, male Ranitomeya hwata actively care for eggs, showing rare parental dedication in amphibians.\nImage: Canva\nFemales lay small clutches of eggs on leaves, requiring a father’s careful attention to survive.\nImage: Canva\nAfter egg-laying, males guard and hydrate the eggs, protecting them from predators and harmful environmental conditions.\nImage: Canva\nMale frogs even feed their tadpoles unfertilized eggs, showing remarkable dedication and unusual parental behaviour.\nImage: Canva\nThis hands-on care dramatically improves tadpole survival rates, giving Ranitomeya hwata an evolutionary advantage over others.\nImage: Canva\nTheir bright coloration warns predators about toxicity, helping protect both the adult frog and vulnerable offspring.\nImage: Canva\nSuch intensive male parenting is extremely rare among amphibians, making this species unique and fascinating.\nImage: Canva\nRainforest destruction threatens their survival, highlighting the importance of protecting habitats and these remarkable frogs.\nImage: Canva",
