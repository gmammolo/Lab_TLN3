  "text": "What’s the best way to have a genuinely positive impact on the world? It’s a question of growing urgency for many young people as our global challenges intensify. For many, the answer leads them to business school.\nThe “impact” metric was introduced to the Corporate Knights MBA ranking several years ago as a bonus, but this year is the first that it has become part of the official ranking. Corporate Knights evaluated 179 programs and ranked the top 40 for their focus on sustainability. Ninety percent of the score these rankings are based on is awarded for the content of the curriculum, and now 10% has been awarded for impact – what schools’ alumni are doing post-graduation.\nThe school with the highest score on this measure this year was Bard College in New York, with an impact rating of 56%. Out of 62 graduates, Corporate Knights identified 35 who are either in sustainability roles or working at companies recognized for their sustainability efforts. By comparison, the average alumni rating was 16% among other schools that made the ranking. Only the University of Vermont’s MBA program had a comparable impact rating of 52%.\nFor the last three years, Bard has consistently ranked in the top five MBA programs for sustainability. Bard stands out as one of the few business schools specifically designating its MBA as an MBA in Sustainability, another being the University of Vermont. “They are not shy about putting the program’s sustainability focus front and centre,” says Corporate Knights research analyst Muhammad Talha.\nWe need our students out changing the world at scale in a hurry.\n- Eban Goodstein, founder of the MBA in sustainability, Bard College\nBard’s graduates have compelling stories: a schoolteacher who went on to become a vice president of ESG (environmental, social and governance) for the Americas at Deutsche Bank within just one year of graduating; the emergency medical technician who became a managing consultant at the global firm Guidehouse. Perhaps the most famous example is Chelsea Mozen, who developed the idea for Etsy to offset its carbon emissions from shipping during her capstone project at Bard. Just four years after graduating, she was the chief sustainability officer for Etsy, making it one of the first major global companies to commit to a climate pledge.\n“Our students’ interests range from food to fashion to energy. There’s a lot of variability,” says Eban Goodstein, an economist and the founder of Bard’s program. He explains that the program is highly experiential. “I think of it as a 24-day retreat spread out over three years,” he says. “It’s almost more like a fine arts degree where you are learning directly from artists.”\nIn Bard’s MBA, students begin working on real-world projects in their first year, often with major industry players. The goal, according to Goodstein, is not just to respond to, but entirely shift how we address – and prevent – mounting environmental and social challenges. “We need our students out changing the world at scale in a hurry,” he adds.\nAll of the MBA programs on the list open up a multitude of options to get that done. For many of these students, it means taking on a key corporate sustainability role at a global leading company, or launching their own enterprise with values of social responsibility and environmental sustainability embedded in the organization’s DNA. But in a different economy, the approach post-graduation might look very different.\n2025 Better World MBA Top 40\n| 2025 Ranking | 2024 Ranking | University name | Country | Final weighted score |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1 | Griffith Business School | Australia | 80.9% |\n| 2 | 2 | University of Vermont: Grossman School of Business | U.S. | 72.7% |\n| 3 | 6 | Maastricht University: School of Business & Economics | Netherlands | 69.4% |\n| 4 | 3 | Bard College | U.S. | 65.7% |\n| 5 | 12 | American University: Kogod School of Business | U.S. | 65.6% |\n| 6 | 5 | Duquesne University: Palumbo-Donahue School of Business | U.S. | 64.2% |\n| 7 | 7 | University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business | South Africa | 63.2% |\n| 8 | 8 | Centrum PUCP Business School | Peru | 62.2% |\n| 9 | 9 | University of Victoria: Peter B.

This year, the spot belongs to Centrum’s PUCP in Peru. Centrum was one of just two South American schools on the top 40 list (the other, Colombia’s Universidad Externado, jumped from 112 in last year’s ranking to 40 in this year’s).\nThis is not the same business environment where you tend to see corporate sustainability officers or climate pledges. But this is precisely what makes this training so important. It’s here that graduates’ vision for social and environmentally positive change – a vision they develop in their MBA program – will have the greatest impact.\nTristan Bronca is an award-winning magazine writer and editor based in Toronto.\n2025 Better World MBA Top Ten Large Schools\n| 2025 Large school rank | School | Country | Average annual graduates* |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Centrum PUCP Business School | Peru | 652 |\n| 2 | Warwick Business School | U.K. | 110 |\n| 3 | York University: Schulich School of Business | Canada | 232 |\n| 4 | University of California at Berkeley: Haas | U.S. | 275 |\n| 5 | University of British Columbia: Sauder School of Business | Canada | 94 |\n| 6 | Toronto Metropolitan University: Ted Rogers School of Management | Canada | 84 |\n| 7 | Gordon Institute of Business Science | South Africa | 306 |\n| 8 | Colorado State University: College of Business | U.S. | 160 |\n| 9 | Rotterdam School of Management: Erasmus University | Netherlands | 108 |\n| 10 | IMD: International Institute for Management Development | Switzerland | 94 |\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe 2025 Corporate Knights Better World MBA Top 40 ranking examines the performances of 179 business schools, drawn from the most recent FT100 MBA Ranking, the Princeton Review Best Green MBA, the Top 40 from the 2024 Better World MBA ranking, and all current PRME Champions; and business schools accredited by the Association of MBAs, the AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) or the EFMD (European Foundation for Management Development) QualityImprovement System (EQUIS) and also signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education that opt in for evaluation. Based on publicly disclosed information on their websites, schools are evaluated on the sustainability content of their core courses and can review and request revisions to the analysis. Additionally, schools may voluntarily provide the number of recent graduates employed with impact organizations, which is worth 10% of the overall score.",
