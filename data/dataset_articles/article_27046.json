  "text": "Griffith's Campbell's Wetland is now safer and more accessible, with major upgrades complete at one of the region's most important natural habitats.\nThe project was made possible through a $358,857 grant from the NSW Government's Crown Reserves Improvement Fund, along with a $151,453 contribution from Griffith City Council.\nThe upgrade includes a new wide, slip-resistant boardwalk, providing safe access for all ages and abilities to enjoy the wetland without disturbing its fragile ecosystem. Other improvements include sealed car parking, new pathways, sandstone seating, picnic areas and entry signage, making the site more welcoming for both locals and visitors.\nHome to more than 170 bird species, Campbell's Wetland is recognised as an Important Bird Area and a favourite spot for birdwatchers, photographers and nature lovers.\nGriffith Mayor, Councillor Doug Curran, said the project is a great example of how partnerships can deliver lasting benefits for the community.\n\"This upgrade has improved access to one of our city's most beautiful natural assets,\" Councillor Curran said.\n\"I have visited the wetlands and was truly blown away by the amount of bird life and beauty of the area. It's a place locals can be proud of, and it also helps attract visitors who want to experience Griffith's natural environment.\"\nVice-President of the Murrumbidgee Field Naturalists, Nella Smith, said the new boardwalk is an important addition.\n\"It gives safe access for birdwatching and education and helps us monitor the wide variety of birds that call the wetland home,\" she said.\nNext steps for Campbell's Wetland include new interpretive signage sharing Wiradjuri cultural knowledge and details about the wetland's ecology.\nhere.",
