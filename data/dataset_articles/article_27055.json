  "text": "SFIF on EU Climate Agreement: “Realistic Approach to Carbon Removals Is Crucial”\nThe Swedish Forest Industries Federation (SFIF) welcomes the Council agreement on a 90 percent climate target for 2040 and amendments to the EU Climate Law. The recognition of the need for a realistic approach to natural carbon sinks is a positive step. To ensure a truly effective transition towards climate neutrality that also safeguards competitiveness and resilience, the climate benefits of substituting fossil-based materials with bio-based alternatives must be fully integrated into the EU’s policy framework.\n\"While we await the final text for a more detailed analysis, SFIF views positively the recognition of the need for a realistic approach to natural carbon removals, that accounts for the uncertainties associated with them, says\", Viveka Beckeman, Director General of SFIF.\nThis consideration is crucial and was also highlighted in the conclusions of the European Council summit in October. SFIF emphasizes that EU climate policy must be grounded in balanced and science-based assessments of natural carbon sinks, including the dynamic nature of European forests and the need for renewable raw materials for the bioeconomy.\n\"The forest-based value chain contributes to climate benefits far beyond the carbon stored in trees. By replacing fossil-intensive products with sustainable materials, the sector plays a vital role in the green transition. This contribution must be fully acknowledged in EU climate policy and supported by an ambitious EU Bioeconomy Strategy \", says Viveka Beckeman, Director General of SFIF.\nKontakter\nPressPress hotline\nTel:+46 (0)8-762 72 208-762 72 20)\npress@forestindustries.se",
