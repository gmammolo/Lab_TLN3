  "text": "Australia no longer a dumping ground for old engines, thanks to emissions regulations – VW\nThe introduction of efficiency standards for new cars has helped change the landscape in Australia for the better, according to Volkswagen.\nRoad Test Editor\nRoad Test Editor\nNew legislation designed to encourage the introduction of new cars with efficient engines and lower emissions is already having an impact on the market.\nPrior to the new laws, a former spokesperson for Volkswagen Group Australia was quoted as saying Australia was leaving itself open to being a dumping ground for old, dirty engines – with automakers not incentivised to bring their latest engine tech here.\nBut Volkswagen Commercial brand director Nathan Johnson told CarExpert the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES) has helped reshape the new-car landscape in Australia.\n“The introduction of NVES has definitely played its part in helping us evolve our drivelines,” he said.\nCarExpert can save you thousands on a new car. Click here to get a great deal.\n“And I’ll be completely transparent on this – until NVES, we were not considered for [battery-electric vehicles] and [plug-in hybrid vehicles].\n“Since the introduction [of NVES], it’s gone from a ‘never’ conversation with the factory to a daily conversation with the factory, which is hugely beneficial for us,” Mr Johnson explained.\nBut while the emissions standards have added layers of complexity behind the scenes, the outcome is far better for both car companies and buyers according to Volkswagen.\n“I think it’s only a positive from a Volkswagen perspective, and we’re now at the table for a lot of these [product planning] discussions earlier – and I can only see it as a positive moving forward.”\nActing corporate communications general manager Daniel DeGasperi added that, while there’s only a finite number of hybrid and electric cars being built in the world, emissions regulations were expected to ramp up in global markets in the coming years.\n“Being part of the Volkswagen Group across all our brands is a huge benefit because we have a lot of levers that we can pull in that regard, and also negotiate with factory [for] better prices.”\nTrusted Reviews, Smarter Choices, Better Prices\nWhere expert car reviews meet expert car buying – CarExpert gives you trusted advice, personalised service and real savings on your next new car.\nBen Zachariah has 20-plus years in automotive media, writing for The Age, Drive, and Wheels, and is an expert in classic car investment.\nRead more",
