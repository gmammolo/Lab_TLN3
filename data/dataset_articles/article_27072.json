  "text": "Inox Wind, wind energy solutions provider, has secured new orders aggregating to 229 MW. The company has received two orders including one repeat order. Both orders include limited-scope EPC and multi-year operations & maintenance O&M services post commissioning.\n160 MW order from leading Indian IPP; repeat order of 69 MW\nThe company has received a 160 MW order (112 MW firm order with an option to extend by an additional 48 MW) from a leading Indian IPP player for the supply of its 3.3 MW wind turbine generators, for projects being developed by the customer across multiple sites.\nIn addition, Inox Wind received a repeat order of around 69 MW from another IPP that is part of a large global clean energy company for a project in Maharashtra. This comes after the company bagged a 153 MW order from the same customer in March 2025.\nThis order follows a 153 MW order received earlier in March 2025 from the same customer, reflecting the growing relationship and trust built in a short period.\nInox Wind targets strong order book for FY26\nSanjeev Agarwal, CEO, Inox Wind added, “The order inflows are strong endorsements of our advanced 3 MW class turbine technology as well as our growing footprint in India’s renewable energy sector. We are also in advanced stages of discussions with multiple other customers and should secure additional orders soon, with a target to close FY26 at a net orderbook covering our execution plans for the subsequent 18-24 months.”\nInox Wind share price\nShare price of Inox Wind has seen a significant decline in past few months. It has decreased 18.23% so far this year.",
