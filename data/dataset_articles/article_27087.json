  "text": "Hundreds of Bluffton residents joined neighbors from across Beaufort County last month to raise nearly $90,000 for clean water projects around the world during the 2025 Walk for Water.\nMore than 700 participants took part in the annual event, held Sept. 13 in Port Royal and Sept. 20 at Wright Family Park in Bluffton. The walks, covering about three miles, symbolized the long, often dangerous journeys that millions of people in developing countries make each day to collect unsafe water.\nThe Bluffton walk drew families, students and volunteers who carried buckets to represent the weight of the daily struggle for clean water. Funds raised through both county events will help Water Mission International — a Charleston-based nonprofit engineering organization — provide safe water and sanitation solutions to an estimated 1,800 people worldwide.\nNan Krueger, Beaufort County Walk for Water committee leader, said this year’s total marked a record for local participation and impact.\n“These are things most of us take for granted but make a transformational difference to those who don’t have them,” Krueger said. “The money the walk raises lifts up people for generations in communities around the world.”\nWalk for Water events are part of a national initiative coordinated by Water Mission, which partners with local communities to design and build sustainable clean-water systems in developing countries and disaster zones.\nFor more information about Beaufort County Walk for Water, visit www.walkforwater.com/beaufort.",
