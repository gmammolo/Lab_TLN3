  "text": "Sustainability is no longer a distant ideal, but a defining career necessity for Asia’s next generation of leaders.\nFrom climate-tech startups in Seoul to green finance hubs in Singapore, young professionals across the region are stepping into roles that demand passion, evidence-based decision-making, measurable outcomes and tangible solutions. The question is no longer whether to act on sustainability, but how to do it credibly, collaboratively and with urgency.\nUniversities are playing an important part in answering that question. As the World Economic Forum notes, higher-education institutions are “a crucial pillar of the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals”, providing the “knowledge, skills and mindsets essential for solving the world’s sustainable development challenges”.\nIn fact, a 2024 report found that universities performing strongly on sustainability measures are often catalysts for innovation and economic growth in their local communities.\nAt Singapore Management University (SMU), this mission takes tangible form through the Ho Bee Professorship in Sustainability Management, established in partnership with Ho Bee Land , a Singapore-headquartered and Singapore Exchange-listed real estate group with investments and developments across Singapore, Australia, China, the United Kingdom and Germany.\nThrough this Professorship, Ho Bee Land hopes to bridge academia and industry, fostering research, education and dialogue that prepare young people to lead responsibly in a fast-evolving global landscape.\nDr Hao Liang, Associate Professor of Finance at SMU, Ho Bee Professor of Sustainability Management, co-director of Singapore Green Finance Centre at SMU and co-lead of SMU’s Sustainable Business Research Peak.\nThat vision extends beyond the classroom. Through initiatives such as the and the , the partnership convenes global experts, business leaders and students to explore how technology, finance and policy can be harnessed to accelerate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon economy.\nThe 2025 edition of the speaker series features Sungho Park , CEO of Reable , a climate-tech company pioneering AI-driven energy optimisation, who will share insights into how technology and collaboration can power the next generation of carbon-neutral cities.\nAhead of the event, Eco-Business spoke with Dr Hao Liang , Associate Professor of Finance at SMU, Ho Bee Professor of Sustainability Management, co-director of Singapore Green Finance Centre at SMU and co-lead of SMU’s Sustainable Business Research Peak. He shares how academia and industry can work together to equip young people with the knowledge, mindset and leadership skills needed to drive a greener, more resilient future.\nSustainability has become a defining challenge of our generation. What does “sustainability leadership” mean to you and why is it so important today? To me, sustainability leadership is about making decisions that are rooted in credible science, comparable in metrics and catalytic impact. It’s not just about normative values – it’s about aligning resources, incentives and governance so businesses can transition while remaining attractive to investors.\nLeaders today need to integrate climate and nature risks into strategy, price in externalities where possible, and implement transition plans that are auditable and financeable. In Asia’s fast-growing economies, doing this well is no longer about compliance – it is what defines business competitiveness.\nHow do you see young people’s role in driving the next phase of sustainable development, especially in Asia and Singapore? Young people are the translators between ambition and execution. In Singapore – and across Asia – they are uniquely positioned to bridge policy roadmaps (taxonomy, disclosure and transition finance) with business practice and capital markets. They are digital natives fluent in data, comfortable with uncertainty, and are naturally collaborative across disciplines.\nWhen that is paired with rigorous training in finance and governance, they become the generation that can turn “net zero intent” into “bankable projects”.\nAt SMU, you’ve been actively involved in mentoring and research. What are some ways the university is helping students turn ideas about sustainability into real-world action? Our Sustainable Finance offerings – including undergraduate track and postgraduate modules – equip students with a comprehensive toolkit spanning impact investing and measurement, carbon markets, sustainability disclosure, environmental, social and governance (ESG) engagement, sustainability risk management and transition finance. This means that students can contribute meaningfully and directly to the sector from day one.\nWe also bring the latest methods – from biodiversity accounting to engagement strategies – directly into classrooms, studios and labs.\nThrough Singapore Green Finance Centre and our industry network, students work on real problems with real data, then present their findings and solutions to practitioners who can implement their ideas in the market.\nSMU’s partnership with Ho Bee Land has been central to advancing this mission. How did this collaboration begin, and what makes it unique compared to other corporate–academic partnerships? Ho Bee Land has long been a steadfast supporter of SMU, championing cutting-edge research and education. The partnership began with a focus on the Chinese economy and business and in recent years, has evolved to focus on sustainability to stay relevant.\nOur partnership is built upon a shared belief that universities should develop knowledge and talent that have a real-world impact. Through Ho Bee’s support for the Ho Bee Professorship in Sustainability Management, we are able to do exactly that – conduct deep research, develop new curriculum, mentor students and convene dialogues that bring together investors, firms and policymakers.\nThe uniqueness lies in co-creation: we don’t treat businesses as “case studies”; we treat them as collaborators – they are partners in research, teaching and talent development.\nCan you share an example of a project, insight or initiative that emerged from the collaboration between Ho Bee Land and SMU that you’re particularly proud of? I’m most proud of how the partnership has enabled conversations around nature, transition and impact conversations that are practical, not just aspirational.\nFor example, we brough together researchers, students and industry leaders at our Nature Finance Conference in 2023 and Global Research Alliance in Sustainable Finance and Investment (GRASFI) annual conference in 2024 to tackle tough questions – how to measure real impacts, design credible roadmaps and finance the shift.\nThese exchanges raised the quality of dialogue on campus and enhanced SMU’s global standing, while creating tangible opportunities for students to contribute.\nWhat inspired the new Sustainability Case Challenge, and how does it help nurture the next generation of green innovators? Two gaps inspired it: first, many case competitions reward good storytelling but don’t require much quantification. Second, students often lack exposure to investor-grade frameworks.\nOur challenge asks teams to pair creativity with credible measurements. Teams learn to translate environmental impacts into monetised terms, stress-test feasibility and map financing structures. They are mentored by industry experts and judged not just on novelty but on implementation pathways.\nStudents leave with something very tangible – a portfolio piece that would hold up in workplaces and boardrooms alike.\nHow concerned are you about artificial intelligence (AI) blocking the path for young people to get into sustainability? I’m not concerned about AI blocking the path; I’m concerned about people not using AI well.\nAI is already indispensable for emissions estimation, nature-risk mapping, anomaly detection in disclosures and scenario analysis. The real skill gap lies in judgment – knowing when model outputs are reliable, how to avoid bias, greenwashing and greenhushing, as well as how to document methods for assurance.\nStudents who pair domain knowledge with responsible AI literacy will be more employable, not less.\nWhat qualities or mindsets do you think young sustainability leaders need to develop to make a real difference in business and policy? First, they should have evidence-first pragmatism: start with materiality and measurement before messaging.\nSecond, they require systems of thinking: deep understanding of supply chains, financing constraints and policy levers.\nThird, they need engagement maturity: the ability to work with, not against, incumbents to accelerate credible transitions.\nFourth, their integrity must withstand scrutiny: assume assurance, disclosure and stakeholder review from day one.\nAnd finally, they need Asia fluency: the ability to translate global standards into local contexts and vice versa.\nWhat gives you hope about the next generation of sustainability leaders and what message would you like them to take away from your work? They are impatient with vague promises and demand accountability. That gives me hope. My message is straightforward: Make it measurable, comparable and investable. Master these, and you can achieve far more than any slogan.\nFor readers who are inspired to grow as sustainability leaders themselves, what would you encourage them to do and how can they get involved in the conversations happening at SMU? Build a robust toolkit – covering finance, impact accounting, nature science, policy fluency and AI/data – then test it on real problems.\nGet involved by joining our public lectures, workshops, and student projects, connect with SMU’s various sustainability programmes and our Sustainable Finance offerings. Bring an open problem from your organisation – we’re eager to co-create rigorous, implementable solutions together.\nThe Ho Bee Professorship in Sustainability Management Luminary Speaker Series 2025 at Singapore Management University features Sungho Park, CEO of Reable, on how AI and collaboration can accelerate carbon-neutral cities.\nThe day also includes the Ho Bee Land–SMU Sustainability Business Case Challenge, where students from SMU and other local universities present practical ideas for a greener future.\nBe part of this day of dialogue and innovation – register here .\nLike this content?
