  "text": "Wildlife & Biodiversity\nUkraine’s massive nature project is helping veterans and land recover\nUkraine's ambitious rewilding project is not only restoring vast natural landscapes but also providing therapeutic benefits for war veterans.\nBy creating new national parks and revitalizing ecosystems, the initiative offers a sanctuary for both nature and people, helping veterans heal from the trauma of war while addressing significant environmental damage caused by the conflict.\nUkrainians have always felt closely tied to their land, often expressing this through literature and folktales. But these connections have grown even stronger since the country was invaded by Russia in 2022.\nForests, rivers and meadows in Ukraine are considered sacred spaces and important to resilience. As Ukrainians have dealt with the constant stress of war, nature has been a place to reconnect.\nUkraine has also been at the forefront of large-scale nature restoration in Europe in recent years. The country is planning two new national parks: Budzhak Steppes National Natural Park (in the Odessa region in the south) and the Great Carpathians National Park (in the south-west). And a project called Rewilding Ukraine has begun restoring some 13,500 hectares of wetlands and steppe (unforested grasslands) — that’s almost twice as big an area as Manhattan in the US.\nThis is serious rewilding. Compare this scale to that to one of the best-known examples of rewilding in England, for instance — the Knepp Castle estate in west Sussex which involves some 3,500 acres (1416 hectares).\nRewilding these areas of Ukraine has involved the release of over 240 animals of different species, including kulan (wild donkeys), steppe marmots, eagle owls, fallow deer and even hamsters which are native to the region and the building of two breeding platforms for Dalmatian pelicans.\nInterventions such as the removal of 200 meters of man-made dams surrounding Ermakiv Island are allowing beavers to thrive and the natural ecosystem to rebalance. There are benefits for the local human populations too, as flooding in villages and towns is reduced.\nHelp for veterans\nThe impact of this massive rewilding project is not only being felt in the landscapes of the Danube delta and adjacent Tarutino steppe in south-west Ukraine where vital efforts are being made to preserve this endangered habitat.\nAn initiative known as Nature for Veterans was launched in 2025 with the aim of helping soldiers and their families find emotional restoration from the horrors of war by immersing them in these newly revitalised areas of south-west Ukraine, far from the frontline.\nMany who avoided death in the conflict find themselves severely affected with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and their loved ones have suffered in their own ways. The value of nature-based therapy for war veterans, particularly those with PTSD, has been understood for many years, since first world war survivors with “shell shock” were commonly prescribed time outdoors.\nThis has particular relevance to Ukraine today as figures from its ministry of health, suggest that some 1.8 million soldiers and veterans may need psychological support.\nEnvironmental damage\nOf course, the war in Ukraine has not only generated a large number of casualties (totalling 400,000) but has also caused enormous destruction to its ecological landscape. Thousands of hectares have been burned; rivers have been polluted by shelling and biodiversity has been interrupted by artillery noise and displacement.\nWhat’s more, as much as 30 per cent of Ukraine has been contaminated by landmines. In total, environmental damage has exceeded US$127 billion (£96 billion).\nTo some extent, due to the contamination of land, the war has also made it more difficult for Ukrainians to connect with nature. And evidence suggests this disruption has affected their mental health, something that is backed up by research showing people’s relationship with their local environment affects their wellbeing.\nFor societies facing the constant stress of war and threats to the country’s territorial integrity, landscape and environment, the chance to connect with nature offers important benefits.\nIn the face of this type of stress, Ukrainians have found ways to restore their lost connections with nature either by rebuilding gardens, adapting to new landscapes and/or finding different ways of sustaining their traditions.\nRewilding is offering renewal and recovery for both Ukraine’s people and its environment.\nNatasha Lindstaedt, Professor in the Department of Government, University of Essex\nJames Canton, Lecturer in Literature, University of Essex\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
