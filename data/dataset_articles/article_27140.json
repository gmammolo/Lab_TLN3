The other prong of climate action is mitigation, which tackles human-driven climate change by absorbing or limiting the production of planet-warming greenhouse gases.\nAdaptation is expected to be a key focus of the climate talks in the Amazonian coastal city of Belem. Negotiators are expected to agree on a set of indicators that countries can use to develop national adaptation plans, and track progress on their implementation.\nMs Fu will represent Singapore at the annual summit, where governments are set to negotiate their joint efforts to curb climate change and deal with its impacts. She is set to fly to Brazil for the second week of talks.\nThe upcoming event marks a decade since nearly 200 countries adopted the Paris Agreement in 2015. The treaty outlines their commitment to working towards capping global temperature increases to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a threshold that can ward off more severe climate impacts.\nThe Republic also takes the same approach in looking at the preparedness of a country or community against climate change, before deciding where to “activate finance for climate action”, said Ms Fu, who is also the Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations.\nUnder the Paris Agreement, developed countries are obligated to provide climate finance for developing countries.\nSingapore, classified by the UN as a developing country, is not obliged to contribute to climate finance, but has helped to channel funds into climate-friendly initiatives in other countries from various sources, including from investors and philanthropies.\nMs Fu cited preparatory plans, such as a country’s efforts to ensure a sustainable water supply or deal with the impact of warming temperatures, as being key to boosting investor confidence.\n“We need to set a certain baseline that investors have the confidence that a local community has its plan throughout,” she said. “The plan needs to be comprehensive and future-ready before the capital can go in.”\nThis comes as the fingerprints of human-driven climate change continue to be felt in 2025, with extreme heat, wildfires and other climate-related disasters ravaging the world.\nLast week, Hurricane Melissa – one of the most powerful storms in history books – that devastated Jamaica was found to have been made four times more likely by climate change.\nDespite having the time and experience to prepare for the storm, the Caribbean island nation suffered damage that cost the equivalent of about 30 per cent of its gross domestic product in 2024.\nWith losses arising from climate change mounting every year, it is in the interest of the whole world to avoid postponing a decision on the global effort to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, said Ms Fu.\nShe added: “The faster we are able to get it done, the more we are able to avert calamity.”\nSingapore is also looking to help develop new financial instruments and adaptation solutions for fellow small island states, she said.\nIts approach to planning for coastal protection could offer some insights to others on how adaptation efforts can be financed.\nIn protecting an area against rising sea levels by building sea walls, for instance, there could also be complementary discussions on whether other efforts, such as creating a reservoir for fresh water, can be made concurrently. That way, the fresh water supply can be monetised, Ms Fu noted. “So we have to think creatively out of the box,” she said.\nAt COP30, leaders are also expected to discuss how to increase climate finance to developing nations.\nAt COP29, rich countries agreed to channel US$300 billion (S$392 billion) annually to poorer nations – an increase from the original target of US$100 billion in yearly finance. But at the upcoming summit, the plan is to see how this quantum can be raised to US$1.3 trillion from governments and other sectors, such as private companies.\nMs Fu stressed Singapore’s support of the mulilateral process, as the conference marks “the only game in town with all the parties signed on with a commitment”.\nHowever, casting a pall over the process is the United States, which, under President Donald Trump, will by January 2026 formally withdraw from the international treaty.\nBut Ms Fu said there will be “strong momentum” from Singapore and other like-minded countries at the two-week meeting to put the climate action process back on track.\nShe likened the US to a student who has left a class and told his peers that “studying is not a good idea”.\nShe said: “So how do we ensure that remaining students in the class will continue to attend, continue to pay attention and continue to work together?\n“You need to have alternative leadership that’s providing that pathway.”\nThe Brazilian presidency has billed it as an “implementation” conference, where the parties will focus on delivering their commitments in climate action plans.\nIn the same spirit, Ms Fu said she plans to focus on helping countries put into practice agreed outcomes and raise interest in adopting solutions.\nFor instance, the rules governing the international trade in carbon credits, which allows nations to cooperate with one another to achieve their climate targets, have already been finalised at COP29.\nTo date, Singapore has signed pacts with 10 countries, paving the way for the resource-strapped Republic to purchase credits from foreign projects that absorb or limit carbon emissions, to offset its carbon footprint.\nA seasoned co-facilitator at previous COP meetings, the minister has helped global negotiations on the rules of global carbon markets reach a consensus in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, and Glasgow.\nWith momentum at risk of slipping due to political and economic headwinds, the world will have to work harder to find opportunities for collaboration, said Ms Fu.\nShe added: “I intend to spend more of my time this time around getting more discussion with my counterparts and also looking at collaborative projects.”\nAt the Singapore pavilion, Ms Fu said, the Republic will showcase the progress it has made on its solutions like the Asean power grid for the country to tap the renewable energy of its neighbours, as well as on carbon credits.\nAs part of the Republic’s team, 12 young people will also be fielded to take part in the global climate meeting. Ms Fu said the experience is meant to help these leaders of the future understand the needs, challenges and constraints of other parties in order to determine what needs to be done to drive inclusive climate action.\n“This is an international process, that if you are not present at the meeting, you are allowing decision to be imposed on,” she said. “So I think it’s important for us to have Singapore’s voices represented in the process, and where possible, we will also want to help shape decisions.”",
