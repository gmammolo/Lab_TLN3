  "text": "House Oversight and Accountability Committee Democrats are looking to force Republicans to advance a review of the Trump administration’s use of Signal after discussing a pending airstrike on Houthi targets over the app. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) introduced a resolution of inquiry that would require the Trump administration to turn over plans for monitoring officials’ conduct on apps such as Signal and retaining any communications sent over the platform. “No one has taken responsibility or explained how these dangerous and irresponsible security lapses occurred. This Resolution of Inquiry will allow Congress to review all the protocol breaches in order to put a stop to the slipshod and unprofessional handling of our national security and force protection responsibilities. Our sons and daughters in uniform deserve better,” Lynch said in a statement. The rarely used resolution is a maneuver that will force Oversight Republicans to hold a markup on the bill, essentially forcing them to hold a hearing on the Trump administration’s use of Signal to discuss highly sensitive information. Resolutions of inquiry must be considered by the committee within 14 days or they move to the House floor as a privileged resolution — forcing a vote by the full House. Oversight Republicans will need to vote down the measure in committee in order to stop its consideration on the floor. While the resolution itself largely looks to secure guidance from the administration in how it plans to use Signal in accordance with federal law, any hearing would be the first on the topic after Democrats have repeatedly called for further review of the episode. Rep. Gerry Connolly (Va.), the top Democrat on the panel, has asked for inspectors general at all of the agencies whose leaders participated on the chat to investigate the Signal chat. The White House has dismissed the need for further review of the Signal chat. “This case has been closed here at the White House, as far as we are concerned,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last week. “There have been steps taken to ensure that something like that can obviously never happen again moving forward, and the president and Mike Waltz and his entire national security team have been working together very well, if you look at how much safer the United States of America is because of the leadership of this team,” Leavitt added, referencing President Trump’s national security adviser.
