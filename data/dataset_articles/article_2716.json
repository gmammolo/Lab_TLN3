  "text": "(NEXSTAR) – Nearly a ton of salted butter is being recalled because, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the product is “contaminated with elevated levels of coliform,” a bacteria found in animals’ digestive tracts and waste. The recall impacts Cabot Creamery’s Extra Creamy Premium Butter with sea salt. The butter was sold as two 4-ounce sticks in a cardboard package and was distributed in seven states: Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. The recalled butter has a best-by date of Sept. 9, 2025, the lot No. 090925-055 and the item No. 2038. Cabot Creamery, headquartered in Vermont, operates under the parent company Agri-Mark. A company spokesperson told Nexstar the vast majority – 99.5% of the product – “recovered” before it reached consumers. The company said 17 packages were sold at retail, all in Vermont. The FDA classified the recall as a “Class III,” meaning exposure to the product is “not likely to cause adverse health consequences.” Regardless, when a food item is recalled, the FDA advises consumers to return it to the store where they purchased it or discard it immediately. Coliform, the type of bacteria found in the recalled butter, is sometimes detected in Vermont’s private water systems, the state’s health department says. The bacteria is common in soil and the digestive waste of animals and humans, but isn’t meant to make it into the food supply. Most types of coliform won’t make you sick if you’re exposed, but some subtypes – such as E. coli – can cause gastrointestinal issues. No illnesses have been reported in this case, Agri-Mark said. “Agri-Mark has identified the cause and has taken the appropriate internal actions to address it. No other products were affected,” the company told Nexstar. “Agri-Mark is dedicated to food safety and producing quality products and is always monitoring its products for compliance.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",
