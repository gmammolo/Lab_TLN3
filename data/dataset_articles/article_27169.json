(TSXV: MN) (FSE: 9SC) (TRADEGATE: 9SC) (OTCQB: MNXXF) is pleased to commend the Government of New Brunswick for advancing a comprehensive framework designed to strengthen and expand the province's mining and critical minerals sector.\nAt the 50th Annual Exploration, Mining and Petroleum (EMP) Conference, held in Fredericton, New Brunswick, from October 26-28, The Honourable Susan Holt, Premier of New Brunswick, and The Honourable John Herron, Minister of Natural Resources, unveiled the Province's Comprehensive Minerals Strategy Framework. The initiative lays the foundation for New Brunswick's full Minerals Strategy, expected to be finalized by Spring 2026, with a focus on transparency, environmental responsibility, and collaboration with First Nations, stakeholders, and industry.\n\"The Government of New Brunswick's framework demonstrates strong leadership and vision,\" said Martin Kepman, CEO of Manganese X Energy Corp. \"As a New Brunswick-based critical minerals company, we fully support this modern, transparent, and environmentally responsible approach-one that balances investment, sustainability, and meaningful Indigenous participation.\"\nManganese X Energy Corp., a proud sponsor of the event, was represented by Chairman Roger Dahn, Director Des Tranquilla, and VP Exploration Perry MacKinnon, who presented an update on the Company's Battery Hill High-Purity Manganese (HPMSM) Project.\nThe provincial framework highlights five key priorities:\nStreamlining regulatory and permitting processes\nRaising public and industry awareness\nEnsuring meaningful Indigenous participation\nEnhancing the investment climate\nMaximizing local economic benefits\n\"Manganese X's vision aligns closely with the province's priorities,\" added Kepman. \"This framework helps position New Brunswick as a leader in responsible mineral development-creating lasting opportunities for communities, investors, and all New Brunswick stakeholders.\"\nFollowing the successful completion of its pilot program with Kemetco, Manganese X Energy advanced additional optimization test work using higher-grade material produced through the recent ore-sorting program. These laboratory-scale studies focused on refining leach performance, acid consumption, and manganese recovery, providing important data in order to support starting the upcoming Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS)-a key milestone toward demonstrating the economic viability of the Battery Hill HPMSM Project.\nThis next phase will further define the project's development path as the Company continues to advance Canada's clean-energy transition, supplying a crucial component for the North American electric-vehicle and energy-storage sectors.\nAbout Manganese X Energy Corp.\nManganese X's mission is to advance its Battery Hill project into production, thereby becoming the first public actively traded manganese mining company in Canada and US to commercialize EV compliant high purity manganese, potentially supplying the North American supply chain. The Company intends on supplying value-added materials to the lithium-ion battery and other alternative energy industries, as well as striving to achieve new carbon-friendly more efficient methodologies, while processing manganese at a lower competitive cost.\nFor more information visit the Company's website at www.manganesexenergycorp.com.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of\nMANGANESE X ENERGY CORP.\nMartin Kepman\nCEO and Director\nEmail: martin@kepman.comTel: 1-514-802-1814\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:\nThis news release contains certain \"forward-looking information\" and \"forward-looking statements\" (collectively \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.
