  "text": "Laredo Police: Four teens identified, two men arrested in south Laredo brawl\nLAREDO, Tex. (KGNS) - Laredo Police say four teenagers have been identified and are expected to face charges after a fight broke out Monday evening, April 7, in a south Laredo neighborhood.\nThe fight happened around 5 p.m. on the 3500 block of Sinaloa Drive, between United South High School and United South Middle School.\nAt first, police said it was just a fight and denied that any shots were fired. But on Tuesday, April 8, they confirmed that gunfire did happen — just as some neighbors had reported.\nTwo men were arrested Tuesday night: 21-year-old Enrique Antonio Diaz and 20-year-old Jacob Velasquez. Both are now behind bars.\nLaredo Police say their Anti-Gang Unit is leading the case because some people involved have alleged ties to organized crime. Officers searched a home on the 2000 block of East Price Street and found a long rifle, a handgun, and bullets.\n“We have been able to identify not only those four juveniles and two adults — there will be other subjects implicated,” Laredo Police Chief Miguel Rodriguez Jr. said Wednesday, April 9. “We continue the investigation. But at this point, those are the only individuals that have been identified.”\nPolice say they plan to arrest the teens once more evidence is ready.\nFor more headlines, click here.\nCopyright 2025 KGNS.
