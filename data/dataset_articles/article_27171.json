  "text": "PMC Aims to Make Pune India’s Cleanest City Within a Year; Commissioner Promises Swift Action\nPune, 6th November 2025: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has stepped up its efforts to improve city cleanliness through intensified night-time cleaning operations. In response to growing safety concerns raised by sanitation workers on night duty, Municipal Commissioner Naval Kishore Ram has assured that security arrangements will be strengthened to protect field staff during late-night operations.\nThe assurance came during a review meeting held in Zone 5 under the ongoing cleanliness campaign Swachhata Pune Pattern, an initiative launched under Commissioner Ram’s leadership. The meeting reviewed the current state of cleanliness, challenges in solid waste management, difficulties faced by ground staff, and strategies to enhance operational efficiency.\nDeputy Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) Sandeep Kadam, Zone 5 Deputy Commissioner Sunil Ballal, along with assistant commissioners, health inspectors, senior inspectors, and mukadams (supervisors) attended the review session.\nDuring the meeting, mukadams highlighted key operational challenges, including a lack of public cooperation, improper waste disposal practices, garbage dumping in open areas, and difficulties in waste collection in congested localities and slums. They also cited vehicle shortages, delays in arranging substitutes, and inadequate manpower — issues worsened by an ageing workforce. Encroachments and roadside vendors were also flagged as contributors to unhygienic conditions in several areas.\nSeveral workers expressed concerns about their safety during night shifts, citing incidents of intimidation and unsafe working environments. Taking note of these concerns, Commissioner Ram directed officials to take immediate action. He instructed that additional garbage transport vehicles be deployed, backup vehicles be kept ready, and better coordination between manpower and logistics be ensured at the ward level.\nEmphasizing a collaborative approach, Commissioner Ram said that teamwork between officers, supervisors, and sanitation workers is crucial to achieving visible results. “Rather than comparing Pune with other cities, we should aim to set our own benchmark. Sanitation workers, mukadams, and officers must work in a coordinated and planned manner. Our goal is to make Pune the cleanest city in the country within the next year,” he stated.\nThe PMC’s renewed focus on worker safety and systematic waste management comes as part of a broader push to improve cleanliness rankings and urban hygiene standards under the Swachhata Pune Pattern initiative.",
