  "text": "Prince ​William Announces Earthshot Prize Winners at Rio Ceremony RIO DE JANEIRO – Prince William revealed the winners of the ⁤2025 Earthshot Prize at a ceremony​ in rio⁣ de ‍Janeiro ⁢on Wednesday, recognizing innovative ‍solutions to environmental challenges. The Prince of Wales’s visit to Brazil underscores the growing urgency surrounding climate action, particularly‍ in the Amazon rainforest, ahead of COP30.\nthe Earthshot Prize, ⁢founded by Prince William ‍in 2020, aims to incentivize and scale ⁢impactful solutions​ to the world’s greatest environmental ‌problems. This year’s ceremony, held⁣ in⁢ a country grappling with deforestation and biodiversity loss, highlights the critical need for⁣ collaborative ⁤efforts to protect the‍ planet. The Prince’s five-day trip to Brazil ‍has focused⁤ heavily on climate and environmental conservation,‌ including a‍ visit to the Christ the Redeemer statue – a location his ⁤mother, Diana, Princess of Wales,‍ famously visited 34 years prior.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan also attended the ceremony. Earlier ⁤in the day, Prince William met with the‌ 15 Earthshot ​Prize finalists at Christ the Redeemer.\nThroughout his trip, ⁢Prince William has emphasized the importance ‍of protecting vital ecosystems. He ‍criticized criminal involvement in Amazon ​deforestation‍ during a speech at the United​ for Wildlife conference on Tuesday. He also visited ⁤the island⁤ of Paqueta, engaging with local communities, learning about mangrove‍ conservation efforts, and participating in tree planting.\nThe⁢ Prince is scheduled to deliver a speech at COP30, the UN’s annual climate change ​meeting, in ‍Belem,⁢ within the Amazon rainforest, on Thursday. His ‌presence at the conference is expected to further galvanize international commitment to addressing climate change and supporting lasting development.",
