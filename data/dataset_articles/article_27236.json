  "text": "Unlock Smarter Bookings with Yonder + ROLLER + Live Availability\nAt Yonder, we’ve purposely chosen to support these natural systems as part of our Carbon Offset Initiative. Here's why we believe they’re critical to tourism’s sustainable future, and why they matter far beyond the numbers.\nNative forest regeneration is the process of restoring ecosystems using local tree species and allowing natural biodiversity to return. Unlike monoculture plantations, these forests support wildlife, prevent erosion, and build climate resilience over generations.\nWhy it matters:\nPeatlands are wetlands made up of partially decomposed organic material. They’re nature’s most efficient carbon sink—storing twice as much carbon as all the world’s forests combined, despite covering just 3% of the Earth’s surface!\nThreats to peatlands:\nThese ecosystems are nature-based climate solutions—and they work. As part of our offsets, we’re supporting projects that:\nRegenerate native bush in Aotearoa New Zealand\nProtect peatland ecosystems from degradation\nRewild Alaska, USA, and restore natural habitats\nProtect native forests in Western Australia from destruction and land development\nWhen you use Yonder, you’re not just improving your business. You’re backing projects that protect our landscapes, store carbon, and sustain the environments that make tourism possible.\nLet’s build a future where every guest interaction supports a healthier planet—starting with the ground beneath our feet.",
