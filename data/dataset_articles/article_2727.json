  "text": "On April 9, 2025, ADOR took legal measures to protect NewJeans from rising online abuse. In a statement titled “Legal Action Status Regarding Artist Rights Infringement,” the agency seeks to crack down on malicious rumors and personal attacks aimed at the group. ADOR believes the hate was sparked by the contract feud, which began in late 2024 and intensified after NewJeans challenged the agency’s management by changing their name and creating separate social media accounts.\nToday is the hearing\nWe do not expect Njz to win it however this time it will be private which might mean confidential information is being shared such as contract details audio or recordings\nHybe could exploit this by spreading misinformation through journalists be aware\n[pic.twitter.com/lDPyMhLMmp]— Lia ✮ (@Liasshy)\n[April 8, 2025]\nThe timing of this announcement coincides with a tense legal battle. In March 2025, the Seoul Central District Court upheld ADOR as NewJeans’ official management, banning any independent activities. On March 21, the members, now calling themselves MHDHH, formally objected, citing a complete loss of trust. Despite court drama, ADOR insists nothing has changed since the court’s initial ruling.\nIt has been reported that\n[#NewJeans]' injunction appeal hearing lasted 10 minutes. When questioned by press, ADOR stated the situation remains unchanged since the initial injunction ruling, while NewJeans' side declined to comment.[https://t.co/xT1gXG5cdt]— Sniper22 (@Snper22)\n[April 9, 2025]\nFans feel ADOR’s move is a joke, accusing the agency of covering deeper issues while clinging to control. NewJeans then declared an indefinite hiatus on March 23, making their fans feel intrigued due to the secretive nature of the hearings. On April 9, both NewJeans’ and ADOR’s legal teams had a closed-door session in court, which the five members didn’t attend, and information was kept under wraps.",
