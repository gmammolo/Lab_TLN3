  "text": "The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) successfully concluded the Special Campaign 5.0 (SC 5.0), conducted from October 2nd to October 31st, 2025. The nationwide drive focused on a multi-pronged approach to enhance governance, focusing on the resolution of pending references, improved record management, and extensive cleanliness initiatives.\nThe symbolic launch of DDWS took place on October 2nd, 2025, under the direct guidance of the Secretary, DDWS, with a cleanliness drive at Sanitation Park near Pt. Deen Dayal Antyodaya Bhawan, CGO Complex, New Delhi, signaling the commitment to efficiency and transparency across all operational levels.\nA significant achievement was realized in space and record management, where 120 square feet of office space was cleared and 100 physical files were successfully weeded out, streamlining records and reducing physical clutter. Furthermore, the systematic disposal of unserviceable assets and scrap including e-waste, during the campaign generated a revenue of ₹ 3,73,706, achieving full target completion and beyond, in these parameters.\nThe Department achieved high success in the disposal of 410 (84%) Public Grievances (PG) and 50 PG Appeals. Crucially, the Department also ensured prompt action on high-priority communications by clearing 16 VIP references, 3 PMO references, and 2 State Government references.\nSecretary, DDWS, Shri Ashok K. K. Meena, personally conducted a review of the campaign's progress, which included a visit to the DDWS office space located in Pt. Deen Dayal Antyodaya Bhawan on 10th October, 2025.\nThe Department has also renewed its commitment to maintaining the momentum and spirit of the Special Campaign 5.0 throughout the year, ensuring that the gains in efficiency, organization, and responsiveness become permanent fixtures of the work culture.\n***\nND",
