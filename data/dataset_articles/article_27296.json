  "text": "Tripling Renewables Is Not Just About Access, It’s About Growth and Productivity\nNewsletter\nAt COP28, the world agreed to triple renewable power by 2030 –to 11.2 terawatts of installed capacity in line with IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook. This global goal provides an opportunity to drive inclusive growth and economic development.\nHere are five ways renewable energy is catalysing sustainable development:\n1. Improving Agriculture’s Resilience and Productivity\nOver 2.5 billion people worldwide rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, making energy and agriculture key drivers for sustainable development.\nIn Rwanda's Bugasera District, female farmers were struggling with lack of water to irrigate their crops. Walking the long distance to get water leads to exhaustion and reduced working hours in the field. These in turn resulted in low productivity and low income.\nAfter they set up a solidarity fund to purchase a solar-powered irrigation system, many things changed for the better. Having sustainable water in the field without much effort means less physical strain and labour, more productivity, and better harvest, which resulted in increased income for the families.\n2. Enabling Universal Healthcare\nIt is estimated that close to 1 billion people in low- and lower-middle-income countries are served by health-care facilities without reliable electricity access or with no electricity access at all.\nAccess to reliable electricity can make the difference between life and death, which was the case for the Kamabarami Health Clinic in Zimbabwe before they installed solar power.\nWhen the clinic received a portable solar powered toolkit designed to support timely and efficient care, healthcare delivery in the clinic transformed overnight. Connected to the solar panels secured on the roof, the toolkit allows healthcare workers to attend to patients safely even at night, allowing them to use a fetal doppler to monitor heart rates and detect abnormalities with proper lighting.\nThis story demonstrates how reliable, renewable power can enhance healthcare services and save lives.\n3. Transforming Small Business\nHome to 1.2 million three-wheelers, Sri Lanka sees electric tuk-tuks transform drivers' lives. Before the electric tuk-tuks were available, drivers in Colombo were burdened with the high cost of fossil fuels and maintenance.\nAfter replacing traditional three-wheelers with electric ones, drivers--who also often are owners--no longer struggle with high expenses.\nThe smooth, silent ride has improved experiences for both drivers and passengers, leading to more orders. And as the electric tuk-tuks can travel up to 150 kilometres on a single charge from solar-powered stations, drivers can serve clients in rural areas and provide courier services.\nWith less costs and high efficiency, these small business owners are increasing their income while contributing to emission reduction on their city’s streets. This shows how solar power and electrification do not only transform small businesses to be sustainable, but also support a country’s net zero goal, since these tuk-tuks emit zero emission and save around 75% on carbon footprint.\n4. Strengthening Fisheries Value Chain\nMauritania’s fisheries sector contributed 2.8% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023 and supported 66 000 direct jobs and 300 000 indirect jobs. Yet fossil fuel dependence sees energy costs consume 40% of expenses, burdening the country’s fishing families.\nAddressing the energy needs of coastal fishing villages requires the use of decentralised renewable energy (DRE) solutions tailored to local conditions, such as solar mini grids. Priority areas include integrating water supply and ice production into village grids, to support the value chain.\nSolar-powered batteries for boat motors, cold storage and refrigeration could reduce fishermen’s hardship, improve working conditions, and allow families to retain more value from their catch. DRE solutions applied in the value chain can increase shelf life, cut losses, and maintain the quality of products.\nIRENA’s analysis found remarkable willingness from the fishing families to embrace renewable energy for those reasons. Eighty-nine percent of fish merchants and 70% of fishermen who took part in the analysis expressed interest in integrating DRE into their operations.\nScaling up DRE solutions for Mauritania’s fishery sector requires a concerted effort from the government, with support from technical and financial partners to raise awareness among national stakeholders.\n5. Empowering Education\nIn the community of Epworth, Zimbabwe, families once struggled with contaminated water that put their health at risk. During the drier months, thirsty and hungry students of the Chinamano Council Primary School often left mid-day due to lack of hydration and nutrition.\nEverything changed when solar panels were installed and a water borehole was constructed at the school premises, a promising approach as off-grid solar remains the most cost-effective solution for 41% of people without electricity access.\nThe solar-powered borehole pumps clean water from the underground, providing reliable supply of clean water. The community started using the clean water to drink, wash, and cook to feed the students, which improve the students’ nutrition and health.\nWith reliable, sustainable clean water access, healthy students now attend school regularly and stay engaged in learning. Active, healthy students bring promise to the community’s future.\nThe Path Forward\nTripling renewable capacity by 2030 is driving systematic transformation and inclusive growth. IRENA calls governments to raise targets, mobilise finance and deepen cooperation to make COP30 a milestone. Energy access is not the end goal; development is.\nFor more on IRENA's campaign showcasing the benefits of meeting the renewables capacity goal, go to: “3xRenewables for the Planet and Its People”.",
