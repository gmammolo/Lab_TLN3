  "text": "Renewable energy firm Sael Industries is set to invest Rs 22,000 crore in Andhra Pradesh across solar, biomass, data centre, and port development projects, a move that will generate 7,000 direct and around 70,000 indirect jobs in the state.\nThe Gurugram-based company is expected to formalise the investment plan through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Andhra Pradesh during the upcoming CII Partnership Summit in Visakhapatnam on November 14–15. The agreement outlines a multi-sector pipeline of projects to bolster the state’s industrial and logistics ecosystem.\nUnder the plan, Sael will establish seven large-scale solar and battery energy storage system (Bess) projects, adding over 1,750 MW of solar capacity with grid-scale storage in Kadapa and Kurnool districts. These projects are designed to deliver round-the-clock renewable power for industrial consumers and data centres.\nThe company also plans to develop 200 MW of biomass-based generation facilities, reinforcing its focus on circular energy solutions. In addition, Sael will invest Rs 3,000 crore in a hyperscale-ready data centre and Rs 4,000 crore in port-linked infrastructure to enhance maritime connectivity and export capacity.\nSael , which has already commissioned 600 MW of renewable capacity in just nine months, said the expansion underscores its execution strength and long-term commitment to accelerating India’s energy transition.\nThe Andhra Pradesh government has been actively courting green and digital infrastructure investments, leveraging the state’s coastal advantage and emerging industrial corridors to attract high-value projects like those proposed by SAEL.",
