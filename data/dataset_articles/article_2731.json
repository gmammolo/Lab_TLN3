  "text": "Authorities asked the public for help Wednesday locating a hit-and-run suspect who struck and killed a woman riding a scooter near the Westmont area of Los Angeles.\nThe crash happened around midnight Tuesday, when a vehicle traveling north on Figueroa Street struck the woman, who was crossing westbound near Colden Avenue, just west of the Harbor (110) Freeway, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.\nThe driver then fled northbound on Figueroa Street without stopping.\nLos Angeles Fire Department paramedics responded to the scene and pronounced the woman dead at scene. She was described only as a woman in her 30s, whose name was being withheld pending notification to next of kin.\nA reward of up to $50,000 is available for anyone who shares information leading to the identification, apprehension and conviction of a suspect in a fatal hit-and-run, authorities added.\nAnyone with information regarding the collision was asked to contact Officer Lopez Del Haro at 323-421-2500 or 877-527-3247 during non-business hours. Tipsters who wish to remain anonymous can call 800-222-8477 or visit lacrimestoppers.org.",
