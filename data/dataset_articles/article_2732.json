  "text": "Mayor John Whitmire said that 900 people charged with murder are free on bond in Houston during a city council meeting this week.\nThe 248th District Court has been the subject of repeated criticism for releasing people charged with violent crimes, including capital murder, back into the community on bond.\n“There are multiple people that have been murdered by people who were out on bond from this court,” said Councilmember Fred Flickinger at the meeting.\nAn analysis performed by KHOU 11 showed that about a third of those released are arrested for additional crimes committed while on bond.\nFlickinger added that it was time to start naming the judges responsible for releasing dangerous criminals.\nThe National Police Association has done so.\nIn an article published in 2021 by the NPA, Doug Wylie explained that “Judge Hilary Unger is unapologetic about a philosophy—no matter how flawed—that compels her to release into the world individuals who have shown a propensity for violence and a callous carelessness for human life.”\nThe article details how district court judges regularly grant bonds to dangerous criminals who go on to victimize more people.\nOne example occurred last week following a SWAT standoff when Houston police recovered the bodies of Austin Collette and his girlfriend. Authorities say he likely shot her before killing himself.\nCollette pleaded guilty to murder in 2019, but Judge Unger authorized his release and had not scheduled a sentencing hearing.\n“More blood is on Judge Hilary Unger’s hands. Austin Collette pled guilty to another murder in December of 2024, yet he was still allowed to be free before sentencing. Now he murdered his girlfriend and killed himself. This senseless tragedy was 100% preventable,” posted the Houston Police Officers’ Union on X.\nEarlier this year, Unger released on bond a man accused of murdering a Harris County Sheriff’s deputy.\nThe Texas Senate recently passed a bipartisan measure that would stop repeat violent offenders from bonding out of jail. They have passed similar measures since 2021.\nThe attempts at reform have died in the Texas House every year.\n“Since the Senate first passed a version of this resolution in January 2021, there have been at least 162 homicide cases filed in Harris County alone involving defendants who were released on one or more criminal case bonds at the time they committed a new murder,” Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stated following passage of the measure.\nNo ads. No paywalls. No government grants. No corporate masters.\nJust real news for real Texans.\nSupport Texas Scorecard to keep it that way!",
