  "text": "Below are remarks from United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell to the Bloomberg Philanthropies Local Climate Action Summit at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum on 5 November 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nExcellencies, Mayors, Governors, Leaders,\nIt is a privilege to be here.\nWe may be 1,500 miles from COP30 in Belém, but the road to success runs through Rio.\nBecause cities, states, and regions are where the climate fight can be won or lost.\nOur new NDC Synthesis report last week shows humanity is making progress through climate cooperation. It also shows sub-national actors playing an increasing role in delivering that progress.\nMore broadly, for the first time we can see emissions are clearly coming down. By 10% by 2035, although clearly that's not nearly enough.\nOur Adaptation report shows progress building resilience, but again much more is needed to unleash its full transformative potential.\nOur Transparency report shows Parties starting to implement Paris, but a major acceleration is still needed.\nMeanwhile climate disasters are sending a wrecking ball through communities, through economies - as we have just seen brutally with Hurricane Melissa. And I know, each of you will have your own experiences of climate impacts.\nWe need to pick up the pace.\nTo do so, we need to bring our COP process closer to the real economy and closer to real people and communities. A crucial part of doing this is accelerating actions at the local and regional level, to spread more of the vast benefits of climate action to billions more people.\nSo this Local Leaders Forum, and events like it, are absolutely essential. I commend Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, along with the COP30 Presidency, for bringing us here today.\nIt's vital because cities, states and regions are where global climate action meets daily life - where inspiration can be found on every corner, and where the great ideas and the big answers take shape.\nLocal climate leadership is central to delivering healthier, wealthier and safer communities and stronger economies.\nTogether, cities and regions drive nearly half of global GDP and represent billions of people.\nThrough regional and city networks, you are showing that climate cooperation delivers clear benefits - cleaner air, safer streets, more resilient communities, and new jobs in the industries of the future.\nYou are the first responders to storms, floods, heatwaves and wildfires - and your experience is shaping more resilient, more inclusive national policies and plans.\nNational goals rely on local delivery.\nThat is why cooperation between every level of government is mission-critical.\nThe Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships framework launched at COP28 must now become part of how every country prepares and implements its climate plans - aligning national vision with local execution.\nWhen local and national leaders move together, we move faster.\nBut there's a problem you know all too well. National governments commit to big infrastructure projects. And as a local leader, what you want to see is shovels in the ground.\nBut too often, it takes too long. Investment doesn't flow, commitment wanes, and in the end plans are not delivered on time, on budget, if at all.\nIn the fight against climate change, it's time for more shovels in the ground.\nTo move from pledges to projects.\nPledges inspire hope - but projects deliver results.\nThe Global Covenant of Mayors' cities alone could cut 4 gigatons of CO₂ annually by 2050 - if current plans are financed and implemented.\nThat's the difference between words and action.\nGovernments are submitting their national climate plans - their NDCs - now. I urge you to get involved sooner rather than later.\nLet's work together - across government layers and borders - to unlock the capital needed for clean power, resilient infrastructure, and green transport.\nData and transparency will help us. The contribution your cities make must be visible - so we can share success, aggregate progress, and learn from each other.\nTo every one of you, I say thank you.\nThank you for being here.\nThank you for your leadership.\nAnd thank you for your action.\nBut I also ask you to dig even deeper - because we are at a decisive moment.\nCities, states and regions are part of the foundation on which the Paris Agreement stands - and the bridge between ambition and real-world results which improve people's lives.\nThe world is watching.\nFrom the street corners to the statehouse, from the alleyway to the summit, let's show that we are stepping it up - faster, fairer, and together.\nI thank you.\nhere.",
