  "text": "NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, November 3, 2025 / EINPresswire.com / — Plankton Energy , a leading developer of distributed solar projects, and Plankton-Gratitude Yield Co., its jointly managed solar impact yield platform, today announced the closing of a $7.5 million revolving construction loan with Locus , a community development financial institution (CDFI) and national leader in community-focused energy impact finance. The facility will fund the construction of rooftop solar power purchase agreement (PPA) projects and low-income community solar installations across multiple states — all of which will be owned and operated by Plankton-Gratitude Yield Co.\nThe new financing enables Plankton Energy to continue rapidly deploying distributed solar assets that reduce utility costs for underserved households and small businesses while helping communities transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy future.\n“This partnership with Locus fuels the expansion of solar access where it’s needed most,” said Dan Giuffrida, CEO of Plankton Energy. “By channeling private capital into distributed clean energy, we’re delivering meaningful economic relief to low-income families, strengthening local grid resilience, and paving the way to an inclusive clean-energy economy.”\nCo-led by Plankton Energy and Gratitude Railroad , Plankton-Gratitude Yield Co. focuses on investments that deliver cash yields to investors alongside measurable social and environmental benefits.

Construction on the first tranche of projects supported by this facility is expected to begin immediately.\nAbout Plankton Energy\nPlankton Energy is a distributed energy developer committed to making clean power accessible, affordable, and resilient for all communities.
