  "text": "Thailand’s national parks have achieved remarkable success in 2025, generating over two billion baht in revenue, with Mu Ko Similan and Khao Yai leading the charge. This surge is attributed to the growing popularity of eco-tourism and the government’s ongoing efforts to preserve the natural beauty of these parks while boosting visitor experiences. Mu Ko Similan, renowned for its crystal-clear waters and vibrant marine life, and Khao Yai, famous for its rich biodiversity and stunning landscapes, have become top destinations for both domestic and international tourists, contributing significantly to Thailand’s eco-tourism growth and the nation’s economy.\nIn fiscal year 2025, Thailand’s national parks generated approximately 2.2 billion baht from entrance fees and accommodation charges, marking another successful year for the country’s thriving tourism sector. This revenue, as announced by the Director-General of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, reflects a steady increase in both domestic and international visitors choosing nature-based tourism experiences in the country’s renowned parks. Advertisement Revenue Growth in Fiscal 2025\nAccording to the department’s report, between October 2024 and September 2025, the revenue from national parks rose by 8.39 million baht, or 0.38%, compared to the same period the previous year. While the increase may seem modest, it underscores the ongoing appeal of Thailand’s natural landscapes, which continue to attract both local and foreign tourists seeking outdoor adventures, wildlife encounters, and scenic beauty. The growth reflects a broader global trend of travelers seeking immersive nature experiences and eco-friendly tourism options. Advertisement Atthapol Charoenshunsa, the Director-General of the Department of National Parks, highlighted that the introduction of an e-ticketing system has significantly streamlined the collection of entrance fees, making it more convenient for tourists and enhancing transparency in financial transactions. The department has also made strides in upgrading its online reservation system for camping grounds and park accommodations, allowing tourists to book their stays in advance, which further promotes a seamless experience.\nThe move towards digitalization has been widely welcomed, as it not only provides visitors with an easier way to manage their visits but also helps the department maintain accurate data for better planning and resource management. This also aligns with the country’s broader push toward modernizing the tourism sector while maintaining the integrity of its natural resources. Advertisement Top Revenue-Generating National Parks in 2025\nSeveral national parks across the country continue to stand out as key players in generating significant revenue. The following is a list of the top 10 national parks that contributed the highest revenue in fiscal year 2025: Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park : 648,920,480 baht Mu Ko Similan National Park : 197,258,000 baht Khao Yai National Park : 138,428,250 baht Doi Inthanon National Park : 131,210,638 baht Khao Laem Ya–Mu Ko Samet National Park : 121,542,460 baht Ao Phang Nga National Park : 115,150,150 baht Khao Sok National Park : 99,807,806 baht Erawan National Park : 93,746,395 baht Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park : 45,391,920 baht Tarutao National Park : 37,879,350 baht\nAmong these, Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is the undisputed leader, bringing in nearly 649 million baht. The park’s stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and proximity to popular tourist destinations like Phi Phi Islands have made it a favorite for both international and domestic visitors.\nMu Ko Similan National Park , which operates seasonally from October to May, stands out for its steady performance. In October 2024, the park generated 11.069 million baht, marking an increase of 11.53% from the same month the previous year. The park attracted 23,578 visitors during the first month of the new season, a modest 1.2% increase compared to the previous season’s numbers. This steady rise in visitor numbers demonstrates the park’s continued popularity, particularly for those seeking scuba diving and snorkeling opportunities, with its vibrant marine life and clear waters.\nEfforts to Boost Sustainability and Environmental Conservation\nThe Department of National Parks is not just focused on increasing revenue, but also on ensuring the long-term sustainability of its national parks. As part of its commitment to environmental conservation, the department is implementing several initiatives designed to protect both land and marine ecosystems across the country. These efforts are particularly aligned with the broader goals of preserving biodiversity, ensuring the health of coral reefs, and protecting rare marine species.\nA key focus for the department in fiscal year 2025 is the protection of marine environments. The department is spearheading initiatives to manage waste in the sea, particularly around the coral reefs and other delicate ecosystems that are often at risk from pollution and over-exploitation. This includes raising awareness among visitors about the importance of minimizing their environmental impact and encouraging sustainable practices during their trips.\nThe department is also taking a bold step by introducing a zero food waste policy across national parks, including both land and marine-based parks. This initiative aims to minimize the waste generated by tourists, ensuring that all food waste is properly managed and disposed of, helping to reduce the carbon footprint of tourism activities and preserving the natural beauty of the parks.\nHer Royal Highness Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana Rajakanya has been a key supporter of these environmental conservation efforts, particularly in marine conservation, and her guidance continues to shape the direction of the department’s initiatives. With the increasing number of visitors to Thailand’s national parks, these steps are crucial to ensuring that the parks can continue to thrive for future generations.\nThe Department of National Parks remains committed to enhancing the visitor experience while safeguarding the environment. With the ongoing growth in revenue from national parks and the adoption of more sustainable practices, Thailand is positioning itself as a leading destination for eco-tourism in Southeast Asia. As more travelers opt for nature-based holidays, these parks are likely to see continued success in the years to come, benefiting both the local communities and the environment.\nIn 2025, Thailand’s national parks, led by Mu Ko Similan and Khao Yai, generated over two billion baht in revenue, driven by the rise in eco-tourism and ongoing conservation efforts to enhance visitor experiences.\nBy continuing to improve its systems, supporting environmental initiatives, and fostering responsible tourism, Thailand’s national parks are poised to remain a key contributor to the country’s tourism sector and a model for sustainable tourism development worldwide.
