  "text": "Indianapolis police honor fallen officer Breann Leath during roll call\nINDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department on Wednesday honored the memory of fallen officer Breann Leath.\nLeath died in the line of duty five years ago.\nOfficers on Wednesday paid their respects during the department’s East District roll call at the Indianapolis Metropolitan Law Enforcement Training Academy. Leath’s mother thanked IMPD for its dedication to keeping her daughter’s memory alive.\nJennifer Leath told the officers, “Her family, her son were not the only ones grieving. You, her IMPD family, felt that loss deeply as well, and, even though five years have passed, I know the grief is still very real and raw for you as well. So, today we gather to honor the bright light she was.”\nLeath died after being shot while responding to a domestic violence call. Elliahs Dorsey a year ago was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison for her murder.\nA prayer vigil was scheduled for Wednesday evening at the IMPD chaplain’s office.\nNews at your fingertips!Stay informed with\nIndiana,\nLocal, and\nNational Newsstraight to your inbox.",
