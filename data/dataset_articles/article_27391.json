  "text": "2 hours ago For the third year in a row, staff from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) joined Michigan Waterways Stewards for a river cleanup in downtown Lansing.\nThe event focused on Cherry Hill Park on the west side of the Grand River and Rotary Park to Buchard Park on the east side. Alyssa Seaton, a toxicologist in EGLE’s Remediation and Redevelopment Division, helped organize the event.\nMore than 30 volunteers participated, including seven from EGLE. Volunteers picked up litter, removed invasive trees and bushes, trimmed grass, and planted new trees to improve the area.\nThe Mid-Michigan Land Conservancy also helped with removing invasive species. Seaton said Cherry Hill Park was cleaner than last year, due to the work of many returning volunteers from several state departments.\nOrganizers are planning another cleanup event next year. EGLE staff who participated included Amanda Bosak, Josh Epperly, Mitch Hemesath, Tamara Lipsey, Aaron Parker, John Riley, and Alyssa Seaton. The project is part of EGLE’s efforts in environmental stewardship and community involvement in Lansing.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
