  "text": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently rated Khangchendzonga National Park as “good” in its latest global review of natural World Heritage sites. It is the only Indian park to receive this rating, while other important areas like the Western Ghats and Sundarbans are facing serious concerns.\nKhangchendzonga, officially known as the Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, is India’s first “mixed” UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognised in 2016 for its combination of natural beauty and cultural importance. Covering 1,784 square kilometres, it stretches from misty subtropical forests at lower altitudes to the icy summit of Mount Khangchendzonga at 8,586 metres, the world’s third-highest peak.\nThe park contains 280 glaciers, more than 70 glacial lakes, and a rich diversity of wildlife, including snow leopards, clouded leopards, red pandas, blue sheep, Himalayan tahr, and over 550 bird species, such as the impeyan pheasant and satyr tragopan.\nThe park is also closely tied to the local culture. For the Lepcha people, it is Mayel Lyang, a hidden paradise given by their gods. Tibetan Buddhists consider it a sacred valley, or beyul, and ancient monasteries like Tholung preserve spiritual traditions that coexist with modern conservation practices.\nThe larger Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve, expanded in 2018, links core protected areas with buffer zones where villagers practice sustainable farming and harvesting. This approach shows that nature and communities can thrive together.\nThe park’s success comes from careful planning, community involvement, and its remote location, which keeps human activity low. Rangers work closely with local people, and cross-border cooperation with Nepal’s Kanchenjunga Conservation Area helps prevent poaching.\nEven natural disasters, like last year’s glacial lake outburst flood, were managed quickly through hazard mapping and preventive measures.\nFor travellers, policymakers and conservationists, the park provides a simple lesson: when nature is respected and people work together to protect it, it can continue to flourish.",
