  "text": "The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOUN) securities between May 10, 2024 and March 3, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until May 27, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the SoundHound class action lawsuit. Captioned Liles v. SoundHound AI, Inc. , No. 25-cv-02915 (N.D. Cal.), the SoundHound class action lawsuit charges SoundHound as well as certain of SoundHound’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIf you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the SoundHound class action lawsuit, please provide your information here:\nhttps://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-soundhound-ai-inc-class-action-lawsuit.h ...\nYou can also contact attorneys J.C.

Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com .\nCASE ALLEGATIONS : SoundHound provides an independent voice AI platform that purportedly enables businesses across industries to deliver high-quality conversational experiences to their customers.\nThe SoundHound class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) material weaknesses in SoundHound’s internal controls over financial reporting impaired SoundHound’s ability to effectively account for corporate acquisitions; (ii) in addition, SoundHound overstated the extent to which it had remediated, and/or its ability to remediate, the material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting; (iii) as a result of the foregoing material weaknesses, SoundHound’s reported goodwill following its acquisition of Amelia Holdings, Inc. was inflated and would need to be corrected; (iv) further, SoundHound would likely require extra time and expense to effectively account for its SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions; and (v) the above increased the risk that SoundHound would be unable to timely file certain financial reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe SoundHound class action lawsuit further alleges that on March 4, 2025, SoundHound disclosed that it would be unable to timely file its annual report for 2024, stating that “[d]ue to the complexity of accounting for [the SYNQ3 and Amelia acquisitions], the Company require[d] additional time to prepare financial statements and the accompanying notes” and that SoundHound “ha[d] identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.” On this news, the price of SoundHound stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint.\nLesen Sie auch Wall Street in Panik Investor O’Leary fordert 400 Prozent China-Zölle: Börsen weltweit im freien Fall gestern 16:22 Opfer des Handelskrieges Apple-Aktie stürzt brutal ab: Nicht mehr wertvollster Konzern an der Börse gestern 08:14 Wegen Bitcoin MicroStrategy meldet Mega-Verlust gestern 05:44 Weitere 50 % Einbruch drohen \"Trump will den Crash – um die Zinsen zu drücken\", sagt Steve Burns 08.04.25, 16:29 THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS : The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired SoundHound securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the SoundHound class action lawsuit.
