  "text": "Canada, (6 November 2025)\nPawzNDogz is a well-known Canadian, female-owned pet product company. They have recently launched a full range of eco-friendly snuffle mats. From basic puzzles for puppies to hard challenges for adult dogs, PawzNDogz has a snuffle mat for every fur baby. These mats are made of biodegradable material and are used as mental stimulation toys for dogs, cats, and other small pets to keep them active. This product meets the needs of pet owners who are concerned about their pets’ health as well as the environment.\nInnovative Pet Enrichment for Every Home\nSnuffle mats are dog puzzle mats (sometimes referred to as snuffle lick mats, or sensory mats for dogs) that enable dogs to engage in their natural foraging behavior. When pets sniff to find the treats hidden in the mat, it makes them feel challenged and thus stimulates them psychologically and physically. These mats encourage healthy behaviours and minimize boredom and anxiety in pets. They are perfect for cat enrichment, fit well with ferret enrichment ideas, and even work as enrichment toys for guinea pigs.\n“Our goal with PawzNDogz snuffle mats is to combine canine enrichment ideas with sustainability. Pets deserve fun, safe, and eco-conscious toys that help them thrive in a safe, green environment,” says Smriti, founder of PawzNDogz.\nKey Features of PawzNDogz Eco-Friendly Snuffle Mats\nHere’s why PawzNDogz Snuffle Mats stand out as a favorite among pets and their parents:\n- These snuffle mats are created using environmentally friendly, non-toxic fabrics that are safe for pets and your surroundings.\n- The mats are machine-washable and can maintain hygiene and longevity. Wash it with a Mesh laundry bag for the best results.\n- These mats are suitable for any type of pet. Be it a beginner-level sniffer, a treat gulper, or little pets such as bunnies and ferrets.\n- They serve multiple purposes and are ideal as a lick mat for dogs, a sensory enrichment tool, or a slow feeder to improve eating habits.\nKeeping Your Fur Babies Physically and Mentally Active\nPawzNDogz snuffle mats have numerous advantages, which make them more than just a plaything:\n- Mental Stimulation: Dogs and cats engage their brains while searching for hidden treats. These mats are considered among the best mental stimulation toys for dogs and also help stimulate curiosity in small pets like rabbits or ferrets.\n- Low-Impact Physical Activity: Light exercise, such as pawing and sniffing, can be performed without overworking the joints, and keeping the overweight pet fit indoors.\n- Slower Eating: Pets who eat very fast can also be helped with a dog puzzle mat or snuffle lick mat. You have to spread some treats or dry food, and it will make mealtime a fun, interesting experience. As the snuffle mats are made of non-toxic material, even if your dog bites on it a little, it will not be harmful!\n- Behavioral Benefits: Snuffle mats provide a constructive outlet for natural foraging instincts. This will minimize destructive behaviors and reduce stress.\n- Weight Management: Regular use helps maintain a healthy way of life by incorporating low-impact activity into the pet’s daily routine.\nEco-Friendly Impact: Good for Pets, Great for the Planet\nThe only difference between PawzNDogz and the other brands in the market is that they are environmentally friendly. These snuffle mats have been created by using biodegradable, non-toxic, recyclable materials, which are pet safe and even friendly to the planet.\nPawzNDogz mats are not like single-use plastics or a low-quality pet toy that can be easily replaced after the first use. PawzNDogz mats are sturdy and have the benefit of lowering waste in the future. When owners adopt such environmentally friendly snuffle mats, they would be contributing actively to reducing their carbon footprint and, at the same time, be providing pets with a healthy, fun, and safe enrichment tool.\nBest Foods and Treats for Snuffle Mats\nWondering what to put in your snuffle mat? These pet-safe foods and treats will keep your furry friend excited and engaged:\n| Food/Treat Type | Benefits | Tips & Notes |\n| Dry Kibble | Encourages natural foraging; slows eating | Use a meal portion or mix with treats |\n| Soft Treats | Adds variety; small, flavorful bites | Cut into small pieces |\n| Freeze-Dried Meat | High protein; highly motivating | Break into tiny bits |\n| Vegetables (Carrots, Peas) | Low-calorie; provides fiber | Serve cooked or raw, in small bite sizes |\n| Fruits (Apple, Blueberries) | Natural sweetness; vitamins & antioxidants | Remove seeds/cores; offer in moderation |\n| Cheese (Low-Fat and not liquid) | Rewarding keeps pets engaged | Use sparingly |\n| Peanut Butter (No Xylitol) | Tasty; encourages prolonged interaction | Use thin layers; ensure xylitol-free |\nIndoor Exercise Alternatives\nFor variety, PawzNDogz recommends combining snuffle mat sessions with other canine enrichment ideas:\n- Interactive toys like Dog Fishy plush or tug ropes.\n- Short indoor fetch games.\n- Slow stair climbs for dogs (joint-friendly).\n- Homemade obstacle courses with cushions or tunnels.\n- Cat sniffing mat or feline enrichment activities for cats.\n- Accessibility mats for combining movement with engagement.\nSafety and Cleaning Tips\n- Supervise pets during initial use.\n- Check mats regularly for damage.\n- Wash mats weekly to prevent bacteria build-up.\n- Avoid overloading with treats.\n- Introduce gradually to prevent frustration.\nAvailability\nPawzNDogz snuffle mats are available online at pawzndogz.ca for wholesale and at your nearby venue, like the pet store Vaudreuil Dorion or Wellington, for local pet parents.
