  "text": "Shopian, Nov 5: A fresh spell of snowfall on Tuesday transformed the Peer Ki Gali mountain pass along the historic Mughal Road into a breathtaking winter wonderland, rekindling hopes among locals that the site could emerge as a prime winter tourist destination in south Kashmir.\nPerched at an altitude of around 11,400 feet in the Pir Panjal range, Peer Ki Gali received nearly four inches of snow since Tuesday evening, covering its meadows, pine slopes, and winding mountain tracks in white. The snowfall continued intermittently through the night, turning the entire stretch of the Mughal Road into a stunning snow-laden spectacle.\n“It looks magical in winter — the entire area remains covered in snow. It feels like Gulmarg,” said Mitha, a social activist from Shopian. “If the government develops basic infrastructure here, Peer Ki Gali could easily become a popular winter tourist destination.”\nKnown for its breathtaking views and religious significance, the mountain pass connects Shopian in south Kashmir with Poonch in Jammu. While the route remains closed for months during winter due to heavy snowfall, the early snow this year has lifted the spirits of nearby villagers who see untapped tourism potential in the area.\nLast year, the district administration had organised a winter carnival at Dobijan along the Mughal Road to promote the area as an offbeat snow destination. The event drew trekkers, photographers, and adventure enthusiasts who braved the cold to experience the untouched beauty of the snow-clad landscape.\n“Last year’s carnival showed how much potential this place has,” said Gatoo, a local resident. “If authorities add facilities like restrooms, parking, and accommodation, this could easily turn into a tourist hotspot.”\nResidents said that during last year’s largely snowless winter across the Valley, Peer Ki Gali and Dobijan stood out as some of the few places that received good snowfall, attracting visitors from different parts of the country.\n“Many tourists visited the area last year to enjoy snow. A steady flow of visitors could boost the local economy,” said Jahangir Ahmad, a resident of Heerpora.\nOfficials said the government has already initiated measures to promote lesser-known destinations like Peer Ki Gali, Dobijan, and Dubjan along the Mughal Road. “Heritage halting stations have been developed, and more infrastructure is being planned,” an official said.",
