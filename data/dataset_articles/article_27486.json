(Alba) is the first aluminium smelter in the world to achieve the British Safety Council (BSC) 5-Star certification in the past five years,” stated Alba’s Chief Executive Officer, Ali Al Baqali, during his keynote...\n\"This 5-Star certification is more than a badge, it's a reflection of our people, our culture and our purpose. At Alba, safety is not just a protocol; it's a mindset that drives everything we do. This recognition belongs to every Albawee.\"",
