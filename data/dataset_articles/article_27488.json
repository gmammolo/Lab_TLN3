  "text": "Aqra bil-\nMalti\nThe day after Prime Minister Robert Abela declared that the White Rocks would become a national park for families, and guaranteed that it will never again see buildings on it, TVMnews spoke with Pembroke Mayor Kaylon Zammit, who expressed satisfaction at this news, because this area of land is part of the locality under his jurisdiction.\nMr Zammit explained that the project comes in the wake of discussions started even in the previous legislature, and described the project as an ambitious one, and the wish of many residents.\nTVMnews was able to see the present state of this abandoned complex, as well as how the use of the White Rocks land area changed over the years. Numerous promises were made about the White Rocks, but none materialised.\nDoors removed, broken windows, vandalism everywhere, building blocks broken and glass splinters scattered all over the place. A total state of abandon. This is the present state of the abandoned White Rocks complex… some 450,000 sq m of land overlooking the sea, sited between Pembroke and Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq.\nSince it was left in this state, the complex ended us as a mecca for street artists. There are hundreds of graffiti and even murals, some on three-storey-high buildings. An open-air art gallery.\nThe White Rocks Complex was built in 1960. It was originally an accommodation project intended for the British services. It was known as the St Patrick’s Officers Married Quarters.\nWith the closure of the military base in 1979, the Tourism Secretariat at the time changed its use to one for tourism. The White Rocks started being used to accommodate the first tourist arrivals in Malta, particularly English language students.\nThe White Rocks were abandoned in 1995, and remain in this sorry state to this day. Many promises were made over the years over how this place could be developed. Different administrations tried to privatise it for development. A Nationalist government tried twice to private the White Rocks, including promising that the area would become a sports and entertainment village. In 2018, the Labour Government identified a consortium that proposed a high-level tourism project at the White Rocks, to include a seven-star hotel. However, negotiations fell through, mainly due to disagreements about land valuation.\nThe Pembroke Mayor told TVMnews that the wish of the residents for this area to come alive again has been heard, adding that he welcomed with satisfaction the Prime Minister’s declaration that the White Rocks will become a national park.\nIt is definitely the wish of the many residents of this locality that the White Rocks project will be implemented. It is an ambitious project. The Local Council will definitely be rolling up its sleeves and working with all concerned entities to ensure the success of this project for the benefit of all Maltese and Gozitans.\nKaylon Zammit – Pembroke Mayor\nThe Pembroke Mayor the next step is for all the entities involved to sit around a table and discuss proposals. He gave his word that the Pembroke Local Council will ensure this project makes sense for the residents.\nSee also:",
