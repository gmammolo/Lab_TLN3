  "text": "Doha: Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi affirmed that the GCC states give strategic priority to digital transformation in their national visions.\n“This comes from their recognition of the importance of modern technology in upgrading economic growth, achieving sustainable development, and enabling societies to have equal access to future opportunities,” Albudaiwi added.\nThis came during his participation in a session organised by the Digital Cooperation Organisation (DCO) titled “Bridging the Global Digital Divide,” held on the sidelines of the 2nd World Summit for Social Development, taking place in Doha, with the participation of several representatives from countries, regional and international organisations, as well as experts and specialists in this field.\nAt the beginning of his speech, Albudaiwi praised DCO’s leading role and commended the launch of their Digital Economy Index report, which is considered one of the most prominent global initiatives for measuring countries’ progress in digital transformation and enabling a knowledge-based economy, contributing to the formulation of more effective policies for more connected and digitally balanced societies.\nHe pointed out that the GCC region represents an advanced model in investing in the digital economy, whether through developing telecommunications infrastructure, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, or enhancing integration between Gulf digital markets, as to build a unified Gulf digital market that is able to compete globally and one that opens new horizons of sustainable development.\nThe GCC Secretary-General added that the GCC countries are working to achieve comprehensive digital transformation by adopting advanced national strategies in the fields of artificial intelligence, big data, and smart government services, to ensure inclusive digital development and enable individuals and institutions to benefit from modern technologies across various sectors.\nAlbudaiwi concluded his speech by stressing that the GCC will continue to support international initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide and strengthening regional and international partnerships in this vital field, in keeping with the aspirations of the leaders of the GCC countries towards a prosperous and sustainable digital future.",
