  "text": "November, 6, 2025\nHayleys Solar, the renewable energy arm of Hayleys Fentons Limited, was recognised for the first time at SLIM Digis 2025, receiving the Best Use of Digital in a Marketing Campaign award in the Energy and Utilities category for its innovative “Energy Peramuna” Election Campaign.\nThe campaign tapped into topical themes, blending humour and cultural references to highlight the brand’s unmatched 20-year solar promise. The campaign featured popular content creator Lochi (Lochana Jayakody), who used political theatre as a mechanism to underscore the brand’s 20-year solar promise and its long-standing presence in renewable energy.\nThe campaign generated over 1.2 million organic social media engagements within four days, sharing a strong audience response.\nCommenting on the achievement, Hasith Prematillake, Managing Director of Hayleys Fentons Limited, said: “Digital platforms enable us to better engage the public on sustainable energy. This recognition underscores our team’s creativity in using these tools effectively.”\n“Winning at SLIM Digis marks a milestone in our digital journey and strengthens our commitment to accelerating Sri Lanka’s clean energy transition and inspiring communities to embrace a future powered by renewable solutions,” mentioned Roshane Perera, Director/Chief Executive Officer of Hayleys Solar.\nSharing her thoughts on the recognition, Nanduni Dahanayaka, Deputy General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, said: “The campaign showcased how conversations of national significance, such as renewable energy, can be brought to life in ways that truly connect with diverse audiences. Rolling and Action Productions took charge of transforming the idea into reality, driving the campaign’s creative direction and production with unmatched creativity.”\nFor more information on Hayleys Solar and its award-winning campaigns, please visit “https://www.hayleyssolar.com” or contact “0112 102 102”\nImage Caption: The Hayleys Solar team celebrating their triumphant win at SLIM Digis 2.5.\nVideo Story",
