  "text": "What was supposed to be a night of joy and music at the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic turned into a nightmare for attendees early Tuesday morning, when the ceiling of the venue collapsed during a concert by the renowned merengue artist Rubby Pérez.\nOne of the survivors of the tragedy is Cristóbal Moya, a man whose shocking image, injured, went viral on social media. However, he survived, though he has not hesitated to describe what he experienced as the worst day of his life.\n“The worst day of my life”, summarized the tough experience from the hospital where he is recovering.\n\"I was able to get out because I was at the same door. God gave me a second chance. That's how I see it,\" he stated in remarks to Univision.\nCristóbal Moya, like many others that night, was enjoying the festive atmosphere of the Jet Set.\nNothing seemed out of the ordinary until an unexpected signal marked the beginning of the disaster.\n“I saw the ceiling break, a panel, and it started to fall like fine sand, and I lost consciousness in an instant,” the man recounted to the mentioned news outlet.\nThe collapse left no time to react. According to accounts, he barely felt \"a hit to the back of the neck\" and fell to the ground, unconscious.\nWhen he woke up, he found himself trapped in the rubble, with unbearable pain and unable to move.\n“At that moment, it felt as if a heavy burden had fallen on me, but the burden landed on a piece of furniture and what it did was compress me. I was there with my knees to my chest, unable to move backward or forward, the weight from behind was too great,” he recounted.\nThe Good Samaritan\nIn the midst of chaos, dust, and the desperate cries of those who were injured or asking about their family members, Moya found a ray of hope: a voice amid the rubble.\n“There was a good Samaritan who came up to me and said, ‘don’t worry, I’ll get you out, what’s your name? My name is so-and-so, don’t worry, don’t worry’”, she said about the person who became her saving angel.\nMoya, still moved by his experience, now has a new concern: he has not been able to locate the three people he was with that night.\nA national tragedy\nThe collapse of the Jet Set has shocked the Dominican Republic. Authorities have declared three days of national mourning and have confirmed a preliminary toll of 124 dead and 155 injured.\nAccording to José Antonio Matos, Deputy Minister of Health, the incident occurred around 1 a.m., while the merengue concert was in full swing.\nRescue teams have been working tirelessly to remove debris and rescue trapped individuals, transferring the injured to various hospitals in the area.\nThe images shared from the scene are breathtaking: piles of collapsed concrete, emergency lights, and bodies covered, waiting for medical assistance.\nOutside the establishment, relatives have gathered, chanting songs of hope while waiting for news about their loved ones.\nOn social media, photographs and lists with the names of individuals who attended the event and have not yet been found have been shared.\nThe Public Health Network (SNS) has released lists of the injured along with the hospitals where they are being treated and has urgently requested blood donations. Additionally, a phone line, *462 option 3, has been set up to provide updated information about the injured.\nOne of the deceased in the tragedy was the singer Rubby Pérez, 68 years old. Another of the deceased is the former Major League Baseball player, Octavio Dotel.\nFrequently Asked Questions about the tragedy at Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic\nWhat happened at the Jet Set nightclub in the Dominican Republic?\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, during a concert by merenguero Rubby Pérez, the roof of the Jet Set nightclub collapsed, causing a tragedy that left at least 124 dead and 155 injured.
