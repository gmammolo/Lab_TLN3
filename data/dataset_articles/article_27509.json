  "text": "MUMBAI: From the hills of Nagaland, a quiet but remarkable leap in clean energy technology has emerged. Scientists at Nagaland University have developed a biodegradable gelatin-based hydrogel electrolyte that could reshape the future of energy storage — making supercapacitors not only safer and more flexible, but also environmentally benign.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now Supercapacitors are the backbone of modern high-performance devices — from electric vehicles and smart wearables to life-saving medical instruments. They charge and discharge rapidly, but the electrolytes that make them powerful often come at an ecological cost. Traditional electrolytes are liquid, corrosive, and potentially toxic, posing both safety and sustainability risks. Mumbai Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know. To tackle this, researchers at Nagaland University engineered a KI-doped glyoxal-crosslinked gelatin hydrogel membrane electrolyte (GNHME) — a mouthful that translates into a small miracle of materials science.\nThe innovation fuses gelatin, a naturally biodegradable protein, with glyoxal, a crosslinker that enhances mechanical flexibility, and potassium iodide (KI), a redox-active compound that improves ionic conductivity. The result: a semi-transparent, flexible hydrogel membrane that conducts ions safely and remains stable through thousands of charge–discharge cycles. The research, published in Materials Today Chemistry (Impact Factor: 6.7) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtchem.2024.102470), has already been granted an Indian patent (No.\n570983; 22/09/2025). Lauding the achievement, Prof. Jagadish K. Patnaik, Vice Chancellor, Nagaland University, said, “Nagaland University is proud of this remarkable achievement by our researchers in developing a biodegradable gelatin-based electrolyte for safer and high-performance supercapacitors. This innovation reflects our commitment to advancing sustainable technologies and contributing to a greener future.\nTired of too many ads? go ad free now I congratulate the research team for their dedication and pioneering work, which enhances the university’s role in promoting scientific excellence and environmental responsibility. ” The project, led by Mr. Duangailung Kamei, with Mr. Dipankar Hazarika and Dr. Nurul Alam Choudhury, was supported by the UGC, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), and Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India. “The development of biodegradable, redox-active solid electrolytes marks an important step toward realising eco-friendly, high-performance energy storage systems compatible with renewable energy integration,” said Dr. Nurul Alam Choudhury, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Principal Investigator. “This technology could play a key role in electric mobility and green energy applications, aligning with India’s sustainable development goals.\n” Tests revealed that the gelatin/glyoxal hydrogel absorbed water up to 717%, giving it remarkable flexibility and resilience. KI doping boosted both energy and power densities, while eliminating leakage and corrosion risks. Prototype devices using this membrane successfully powered LED lamps — a small but telling proof of concept. “Currently, our team is working to optimise dopant composition to further enhance energy density and extend the lifespan of the devices,” said Mr.\nDuangailung Kamei, Lead Researcher. “The next phase involves scaling up fabrication and integrating these membranes with commercial-grade electrodes to assess performance in real-world systems.” Mr. Dipankar Hazarika, Co-Researcher, added, “This work underscores India’s growing contribution to global clean energy research. By offering an environmentally benign, cost-effective, and high-performance alternative to traditional electrolytes, the KI-doped gelatin hydrogel technology holds immense promise for future-ready supercapacitors that can drive cleaner, safer, and more sustainable energy solutions for generations to come.\n” By replacing toxic synthetics with biodegradable components, Nagaland University’s breakthrough points to a future where energy storage is not just efficient — but ethical. In a world seeking to decarbonize, it’s a reminder that true innovation often lies in making power gentler.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media",
