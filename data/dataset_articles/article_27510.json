  "text": "Bijliride Offsets 80 Tonnes of CO2 During Hyderabad's Festive Season\nIndia's EV rental startup reports significant environmental impact as its electric two-wheeler fleet completes 2 crore green kilometres across delivery and commuting networks during 2025 festivities.\nElectric vehicle rental platform Bijliride has announced that its operations in Hyderabad offset approximately 80 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during the 2025 festive season, while its fleet collectively covered over 2 crore green kilometres.\nThe mobility-tech startup's electric two-wheeler fleet served delivery and daily commuting needs across the city during a period traditionally marked by increased vehicular traffic and elevated pollution levels. The company maintained operations through its service infrastructure, which includes battery swapping stations, roadside assistance, and doorstep battery delivery.\n\"Offsetting around 80 tonnes of CO₂ and completing 2 crore green kilometres in one season reaffirmed that electric mobility is no longer a distant dream,\" said Shivam Sisodiya, CEO and Co-Founder of Bijliride. \"Our mission is to make sustainable transportation accessible and meaningful for every Indian city.\"\nThe festive season in India typically sees a surge in vehicle sales and urban traffic, contributing to temporary spikes in air pollution across major metropolitan areas. Bijliride's electric vehicle deployment in Hyderabad represents an attempt to provide emission-free alternatives during peak demand periods.\nFounded in 2020, Bijliride operates a fleet of over 4,000 electric vehicles across multiple Indian cities. The company functions as a SaaS-powered rental platform serving both individual customers and enterprise clients. It has stated an objective to reach one million users by 2030 through franchise-led expansion and technology integration.\nThe electric mobility sector in India has seen growing interest as cities grapple with air quality concerns and the government promotes clean transportation initiatives. Bijliride's model combines vehicle rental with supporting infrastructure aimed at addressing range anxiety and operational challenges associated with electric two-wheelers.\nThe company's festive season performance in Hyderabad adds to ongoing discussions about the scalability and practical impact of electric vehicle adoption in Indian urban centers, where traditional fuel-based two-wheelers remain the dominant mode of personal transport.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nAttractive discounts on Maruti Grand Vitara, other models in November 2025\nMaruti Nexa showrooms are offering big benefits on its entire line-up.
