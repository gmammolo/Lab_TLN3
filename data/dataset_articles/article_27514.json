  "text": "Alight receives multi-million grant from the EU Innovation Fund for pioneering solar project in Finland\nAlight, a leading Nordic solar developer and independent power producer, has been awarded a multi-million grant from the European Commission’s Innovation Fund 2024 for its solar project in Loviisa, Finland, that is co-developed with Finnish renewable firm 3Flash. The grant, announced as part of a highly competitive process in which 373 projects applied and only 61 were selected, highlights Alight’s commitment to accelerating the transition to renewable energy across Europe.\nThe planned solar park is a large-scale project with a planned capacity of approximately 120 MW, with a co-located battery energy storage system (BESS) of approximately 45 MW. The project is located in Loviisa, in southeastern Finland, and designed with a focus on agrivoltaics - integrating solar energy production with agricultural land use. The innovative design utilizes AI and trackers, optimizing both energy yield and agricultural productivity.\nThe Innovation Fund grant recognizes the project’s innovative and replicable approach and its alignment with EU sustainability goals. Once commissioned, the solar park will support Finland and Europe’s climate ambitions by delivering about 155 GWh of electricity annually, enough to power around 31,000 households*.\nThe project spans over 225 hectares and is currently advancing through the zoning process, with the application expected to be submitted shortly. Subject to permitting and grid connection milestones, construction could commence in 2026. The grant agreement with the European Commission is to be signed by March 2026, and the process of signing a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with a corporate offtaker is ongoing.\n“We are honored to see our project recognized by the European Commission as a leading example of innovation in renewable energy, and proud to set a new benchmark for an agrivoltaic hybrid park in the Nordics. This solar park with integrated battery storage will deliver clean power and flexibility services to the Finnish grid, while also demonstrating how solar can co-exist with and support agricultural productivity. The Innovation Fund grant is a testament to the combined expertise of Alight and 3Flash, and our commitment to a more sustainable future”, says Warren Campbell, CEO of Alight.\n“It’s great to see Finnish projects succeeding once again in the EU Innovation Fund call! We need new net-zero technology initiatives across different sectors as we move away from a fossil-based economy. Success in EU-level funding rounds demonstrates how Finland’s strong innovation and technology expertise can provide highly interesting solutions to address global challenges,” says Minister of the Environment and Climate Sari Multala in a press release from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.\n*Based on an average annual household electricity consumption of 5,000 kWh (excluding electric heating).\nAbout 3Flash Finland Oy\n3Flash Finland Oy is leading Finnish renewable energy developer specializing in\nlarge-scale solar, agrivoltaics and hybrid energy projects. The company focuses\non innovative approaches to grid-scale PV systems, battery energy storage\nintegration and AI-based energy market optimization. 3Flash is committed to\nadvancing sustainable technologies and creating scalable solutions for the clean\nenergy transition across Northern Europe.\nFor more information, contact:\nJohanna Snickars, Chief Communications & Sustainability Officer, Alight, Johanna.snickars@alight-energy.com\nMiko Huomo, CEO, 3Flash Finland Oy, miko.huomo@3flash.fi, tel. +358 50 410 1270\nAbout Alight\nAt Alight, we’re on a mission to kick carbon off the grid by helping energy-intensive businesses switch to solar. We develop, own and operate onsite and offsite solar projects across Europe and sell the clean energy to businesses at a low, fixed cost backed by a power purchase agreement (PPA), always independent of government funding or subsidies. By 2030, we aim to have an installed capacity of at least 5 GW, paving the way for a more sustainable future.\nTags:",
