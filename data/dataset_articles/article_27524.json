  "text": "News\nSM Prime: Smarter Water Management for a Resilient Future\nPosted by SM Supermalls on November 06, 2025\nNews\nPosted by SM Supermalls on November 06, 2025\nManila, Philippines — Water is a limited resource, and many Philippine cities face pressure on their supply due to rapid urbanization and climate change. SM Prime Holdings, Inc. (SM Prime), one of the largest integrated property developers in Southeast Asia, prioritizes water efficiency as a core operational strategy to pave the way for a water-resilient future.\n(Photo caption) One of the world’s largest shopping malls, the SM Mall of Asia remains a sustainable marvel thanks to its water-saving solutions.\nThe result is a portfolio-wide water intensity of 0.44 m³/m²/year, already surpassing water efficiency standards of some of the leading global benchmarks.\nFor SM Supermalls, every chance to collect and conserve water is explored. Simple low-flow fixtures and the adoption of water-saving technologies prevent unnecessary consumption at scale. Recycling air conditioning condensate and processed water minimizes dependence on fresh water, and innovative approaches that capture portions of floodwater for non-potable use support sustainable water management.\n(Photo caption) Managing water through innovation. SM City Laoag achieves everyday water responsible practices by recycling non-potable water for landscaping and garden irrigation, cleaning, air conditioning systems, and toilet-flushing.\nThis efficiency means that for every square meter of mall space, SM Supermalls' water use translates into millions of liters saved annually.\nBeyond equipment and systems upgrades, culturally integrating sustainability values is part of the solution. Water education campaigns for tenant-partners, employees, and mallgoers promote the wider sustainability campaign of the SM Green Movement.\n(Photo caption) SM Supermalls was ahead of the Clean Water Act in 2004. SM City North Edsa lessens its dependence on freshwater sources for non-potable uses, optimizing resource efficiency and reducing environmental impact. The mall’s Sky Garden’s 400-meter green roof development is a green space in the dense urban jungle.\nCreating a sustainable mall experience like no other, SM Supermalls believes that investing in efficient and scalable water management systems also means bringing everyone together to ensure water for tomorrow.\n“Our mall water management systems are already at par with some of the best in the world. We do this because we understand that every liter saved eases the pressure on local water resources and secures our operations for the long term,” said SM Supermalls President Steven Tan.\n(Photo caption) Water efficiency is nationwide for SM Supermalls. SM Seaside Cebu, the fourth-largest mall in the Philippines, uses recycled water for toilets, cleaning, and landscaping needs.\nEvery drop makes a difference, and conserving the planet’s valuable resources is communicated through SM Cares’ large and unique community platform, whether in the malls or on social media. The interactive and visually rich content is especially appealing for the younger, digitally active millennial and Gen Z workforce.\n“Our work in the malls is to make sure that we give you the best experience without compromising the needs of tomorrow, but of course, we cannot do it alone. When we combine all our actions as a community, no matter how big or small these are, we can all enjoy a water-resilient future,” said Tan.\nAbout SM Green Movement:\nSM Prime Holdings, Inc. (SM Prime) is one of the largest integrated property developers in Southeast Asia, committed to creating sustainable, innovative, and inclusive spaces for Filipinos. Guided by its vision of building a better future, SM Prime develops malls, residences, offices, hotels, and leisure properties that support the growth of communities across the Philippines.\nThrough the SM Green Movement, SM Prime champions sustainability by focusing on waste management, water stewardship, and energy efficiency for lasting impact.
