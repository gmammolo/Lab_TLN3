  "text": "The Malta Development Association on Thursday welcomed the government’s decision to transform the White Rocks site into a national park.\nDuring his budget address in parliament on Tuesday, Robert Abela announced the White Rocks complex will be transformed into a national, open and green park for families.\nHe said he would cancel the public call for a development on the 450,000 square metre site \"immediately\", and said the government will build the park while also transforming Manoel Island into a national park.\nMoviment Graffitti was among the first to welcome the decision while reiterating its call to revise the controversial planning reforms.\nOn Thursday, MDA also welcomed the news.\n\"The MDA’s position has always been that the priority use of government land should be for projects that serve the wider public interest, create open spaces, and enhance the quality of life.\n\"The decision on White Rocks is a positive step in this direction, restoring a long-neglected area and returning it to the community after decades of abandonment.\"\nIn a statement, MDA said it believed the regeneration of White Rocks as a public park should serve as a model for how disused state property can be restored through well-structured partnerships, combining public stewardship with professional expertise from the private sector.\nSuch collaboration would ensure that the park is properly planned, financed, and maintained to high standards, and that it remains accessible and safe for all, it added.\n\"The MDA reiterates its readiness to work closely with the authorities to support regeneration projects that enhance Malta’s urban and coastal landscape, promote good planning practice, and serve the public interest.\"",
