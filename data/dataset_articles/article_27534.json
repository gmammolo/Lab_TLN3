  "text": "Thailand has released its second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0), which aims to reduce its net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 152 MtCO₂eq by 2035, representing a 47% reduction (135.2 MtCO₂eq) compared to 2019 levels. The base year for emissions is 2019, when net GHG emissions stood at 287.2 MtCO₂eq, and total emissions at 379.2 MtCO₂eq. The implementation period for this target runs from 1 January 2031 to 31 December 2035, with a single-year target set for 2035.\nThailand’s NDC 3.0 establishes an economy-wide absolute GHG emissions reduction target, covering all anthropogenic emissions and removals across IPCC sectors, including Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and Waste.\nAdditionally, Thailand aims to peak its GHG emissions before 2030 and follow a trajectory toward net-zero emissions by 2050.\nIn its NDC 2.0, Thailand committed to reducing GHG emissions by 30% from the business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030, using 2005 as the base year. The reduction could increase to 40% with sufficient technology, finance, and capacity-building support.\nInterested in Global Energy Research?\nEnerdata's premium online information service provides up-to-date market reports on 110+ countries.
