  "text": "Because we don't have enough water, using treated wastewater for plants is a good way to give them the water they need. This study was done to see how water that has been treated and has magnets in it affects soil using three different kinds of irrigation treatments; including \"wastewater\", \"magnetic wastewater\" and \"normal water\", and four times to make sure the results were accurate. Soil samples collected from two layers of soil, one near the surface and one deeper down, and from the top and bottom of each furrow. The findings showed that the treatments did not have much of a difference in soil EC levels. However, the treatment with magnetized wastewater caused a lot of changes in salinity levels in the lower layers of soil. This is probably because the salt in the wastewater can move easily and build up in the soil underground. The pH of the soil changed because of the wastewater and became lower. However, making the wastewater magnetic did not have a significant impact on the pH of the soil.",
