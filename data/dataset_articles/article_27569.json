  "text": "Stocking sturgeon: Effort restores iconic fish in creek, lake\nThe release represents the beginning of a 25-year restoration plan aimed at reestablishing a self-sustaining population of spawning adult lake sturgeon in the waterway. After being stocked, the eight-inch fish are expected to migrate downstream into Lake Erie, where they will mature over the next 15 to 20 years before returning to spawn.\nHistorically, Lake Erie supported at least 19 spawning populations of lake sturgeon, including Cattaraugus Creek. Today, there are only two that remain. This project seeks to help reverse that loss and bring back a species once abundant throughout the Great Lakes region. The return of sturgeon to Cattaraugus Creek and Lake Erie is both a conservation triumph and a cultural reconnection. Sturgeon are living symbols of healthy waters and a reminder of how partnerships can restore balance to our ecosystems. We need more of that.\nFor conservationists, the reintroduction of lake sturgeon represents the revival of an ancient fish species — a keystone fish capable of living more than 100 years and growing up to seven feet long. Their return signals improved habitat quality and healthier aquatic ecosystems that support a variety of other fish species cherished by anglers.\nFor sportsmen and women, this stocking effort highlights decades of habitat restoration and stewardship that benefit all who fish or recreate along Cattaraugus Creek and Lake Erie. While fishing for lake sturgeon remains prohibited due to their protected status, their recovery stands as a hopeful sign for future generations of anglers and conservationists alike.\nFor the Seneca Nation of Indians, the event carries deep cultural meaning. The sturgeon has long been revered as a sacred and respected species — a vital part of the natural world that sustained Indigenous communities for centuries. The Nation’s collaboration in this restoration effort reflects a shared commitment to protecting native species and preserving the balance between people and nature, a cultural homecoming.\nThe 25-year partnership between the DEC, Seneca Nation, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service underscores a long-term investment in the health of Western New York’s waterways. As these sturgeon grow, migrate, and — hopefully — return to spawn, they’ll help write a new chapter in the story of Lake Erie’s recovery.\nFor now, the sight of 1,000 young sturgeon slipping into Cattaraugus Creek serves as both a promise and a reminder: with persistence, partnership, and respect for the natural world, even the rarest species can make their way home again.\nGotta love the outdoors.\nHere’s some upcoming events:\n— Saturday and Sunday: NYS Western Zone waterfowl hunting, military days, see syllabus for bag limits/rules.\n— Nov. 11: NYS Free Fishing Day, no license needed to fish for residents and non-residents (In honor of Veterans Day).\n— Nov. 14: Final Day of Southern Zone Early Archery Season, and final day of NYS woodcock season.\n— Nov. 11: Children in the Stream, Youth Fly Fishing program, free, Costello Room, Rockefeller Art Center, SUNY Fredonia, 7 -830PM, 12 yrs old and older, info: 716-410-7003 (Alberto Rey).\n— Nov. 15: NYS Southern Zone Regular (firearms) Southern Zone Big Game hunting season opens, through Dec. 7.",
