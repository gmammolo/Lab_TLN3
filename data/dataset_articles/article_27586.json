  "text": "The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has taken a step toward sustainable innovation with the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) for airside operations across Nigeria’s five international airports, Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Enugu.\nThe agency in a statement on its X handle said that this marks the first deployment of EVs in the nation’s aviation sector, positioning NiMet at the forefront of environmental transformation and operational efficiency.\nThe vehicles, capable of covering up to 200 kilometers on a single charge, will be supported by dedicated charging stations at each airport, creating a practical and eco-friendly ecosystem that supports day-to-day operations without reliance on fossil fuels.\nThe Agency explained that beyond advancing environmental goals, the introduction of electric vehicles will significantly enhance NiMet’s operational services.\n“The quiet and efficient EVs will facilitate smoother airside logistics, reduce downtime linked to fuel supply challenges, and cut operational costs, all of which contribute to more reliable, timely, and energy-efficient service delivery.\n“By minimising emissions and maintenance demands, NiMet can channel more resources into its core functions of weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and aviation safety,” the statement read.\nRead also: NiMet launches centralised data platform to enhance aviation safety\nAccording to NiMet, the adoption of electric vehicles offers multiple benefits, from zero emissions and lower maintenance costs to reduced noise levels and improved energy efficiency, which also supports Nigeria’s national carbon credit targets and demonstrates a tangible commitment to global sustainability standards.\n“This milestone further underscores the commitment of NiMet’s Director General/CEO, Professor Charles Anosike, to sustainable development, innovation, and excellence. Under his leadership, NiMet continues to drive forward-thinking initiatives that not only modernise its operations but also strengthen its role as a key player in advancing green growth and environmental responsibility within the aviation sector,” the statement added.\nJoin BusinessDay whatsapp Channel, to stay up to date\nOpen In Whatsapp",
