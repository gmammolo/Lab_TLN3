  "text": "The global aviation industry is experiencing robust growth, primarily driven by increasing demand for both domestic and international travel. The Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a significant contributor to this expansion, with air passenger traffic projected to exceed the global average. India, currently the third-largest aviation market worldwide, is witnessing a surge in passenger traffic and fleet expansion, supported by shifts in consumer behaviour, improved regional connectivity and airport infrastructure development.\nWhile this momentum enhances global access and mobility, it also drives up fuel consumption and significantly increases carbon emissions, intensifying environmental challenges. Without effective mitigation, aviation’s environmental footprint could undermine global climate objectives, underscoring the urgent need for industry-wide decarbonisation.\nAmong the various approaches to decarbonise aviation, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is recognised as one of the most promising solutions. It is projected to contribute approximately 65 per cent of the total emissions reductions for the sector to achieve net-zero by 2050. SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable feedstocks such as agricultural residue and municipal waste. Although its hydrocarbon structure closely resembles that of conventional fossil fuel, resulting in similar tailpipe emissions, the key difference lies in its origin.\nIndia holds a strategic edge in SAF production due to its abundant bio-based feedstocks, producing nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus biomass.",
