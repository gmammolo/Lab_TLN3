  "text": "Across the diverse landscapes of Albania, a significant digital transformation is reshaping rural life and agriculture. Farmers, especially women and youth, are adopting new technologies that are redefining traditional practices and improving productivity. From precision farming in Korça to peer learning in Manëz, communities are embracing digital innovation to exchange knowledge and modernize their work. This shift is being driven by the Digital Agriculture for Rural Transformation (DART) project—a collaborative initiative between the Government of Albania, the United Nations, and development partners from the European Union, Spain, and Sweden. The project goes beyond technological upgrades to reimagine rural potential by making digital agriculture inclusive and accessible for all.\nLed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with support from the International Labour Organization (ILO), International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and Albania’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, DART aims to create a national digital agriculture strategy aligned with EU standards. It also focuses on enhancing the Albanian Farmers’ Portal to expand access to e-services and building digital skills among farmers, students, and public-sector workers. According to Lorena Pullumbi, Assistant FAO Representative in Albania, digitalization is not merely a tool but a key accelerator for transforming agrifood systems and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.\nDespite the progress, Albania still faces a digital divide, particularly in remote rural areas where many smallholders and elderly farmers lack access to reliable internet, markets, and e-services. As 41 percent of Albanians live in rural areas, agriculture remains vital to the economy, contributing 19 percent to GDP and employing over a third of the workforce. Bridging this divide requires strong policies that promote inclusive digital transformation, and initiatives like DART are turning national strategies into tangible action.\nThe DART project operates through three interconnected pillars—policy, services, and skills—ensuring that no one is left behind. It supports Albania’s first Strategy on Digital Agriculture and Rural Transformation, upgrades the Farmers’ Portal for better access to resources and subsidies, and provides digital training to thousands of rural women, farmers, youth, and students. This inclusive approach ensures that digital innovation benefits everyone, including those most at risk of exclusion.\nThe impact of these efforts is already visible across the country. Farmers like Ylver Bylykbashi from Korça are using precision tools to increase productivity and reduce waste, while Ergys Sevdari from Dibër highlights how reliable information helps farmers avoid harmful practices. Raspberry farmer Manjola Hafizi values the Farmers’ Portal for connecting producers and sharing experiences, envisioning an “AgroBot Forum” for farmer collaboration. Government officials, such as Ervin Hajdaraga from the Ministry of Agriculture, view the portal as a potential digital extension service that brings expert knowledge directly to farmers. Meanwhile, vocational school leaders Matilda Canaku and Erina Disho emphasize the importance of integrating digital education and training into the curriculum to prepare the next generation of agricultural professionals.\nSo far, over 500 farmers, educators, and advisory staff have contributed to shaping DART’s strategies and tools, and more than 25 local institutions are actively participating in its design and implementation. By the project’s completion, 7,500 rural women will have received digital skills training, marking a major step toward an inclusive, resilient, and EU-aligned agricultural sector.\nAs Albania’s rural communities embrace digital innovation, the DART project is fostering a new era of empowerment and opportunity. Through collaboration, co-creation, and trust, digital tools are transforming agriculture from the ground up—enabling farmers, youth, and women to lead Albania’s journey toward a smarter, more connected, and sustainable rural future.",
