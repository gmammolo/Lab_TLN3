  "text": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has handed over high-quality tilapia broodstock to the Henderson Research Station in Mazowe, Zimbabwe, marking a significant milestone in strengthening the country’s aquaculture seed systems and enhancing fish production capacity. The initiative, carried out under FAO’s Technical Support to Enhance Fish Breeding and Production in Zimbabwe Project, is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development (MLAFWRD). A total of 3,600 broodstock, including 900 males, were delivered to Henderson Research Station, complementing earlier deliveries to Makoholi and Matopos government hatcheries. The stocking process follows a 1:3 male-to-female ratio to ensure genetic diversity, sustainable broodstock management, and improved breeding outcomes.\nThis effort aligns with Zimbabwe’s national priorities, including the Presidential Community Fisheries Scheme and the Presidential Rural Development Programme, both of which seek to promote aquaculture, create rural employment, and improve food and nutrition security. It also responds to challenges identified by FAO’s FISH4ACP programme, such as poor fingerling quality, inbreeding, and weak hatchery management systems. According to FAO Agrifood Systems Coordination Specialist Phillip Goredema, the provision of high-quality broodstock will ensure a reliable supply of quality fingerlings, strengthen small-scale fish farming, and build a resilient and inclusive aquaculture sector in Zimbabwe.\nGovernment officials have welcomed the handover as a critical milestone in advancing national aquaculture development. Chenjemulene Madzivanyika, Fisheries Officer at MLAFWRD, emphasized that the programme will modernize hatchery systems, strengthen genetic management, and expand access to quality fish seed, contributing to higher production, stronger rural economies, and better nutrition outcomes across the country.\nBeyond the broodstock delivery, FAO is supporting the creation of a conducive environment for sustainable aquaculture growth through the development of national hatchery management guidelines. These guidelines address areas such as broodstock and genetic management, hatchery infrastructure, biosecurity, capacity building, and policy alignment. Assistant FAO Representative – Programmes, Tendai Munyokoveri, highlighted that the framework will enhance both technical and institutional aspects of hatchery management, ensuring long-term sustainability.\nZimbabwe’s aquaculture sector, dominated by Nile tilapia farming, continues to expand. By strengthening state hatcheries and improving seed quality, FAO’s intervention is expected to promote broader adoption of aquaculture technologies, particularly among women and youth, safeguard genetic resources, and enhance productivity and competitiveness across the aquaculture value chain.",
