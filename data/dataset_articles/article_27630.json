  "text": "ACWA Power Company +0.27% China’s Envision Energy has signed a seven-year framework agreement with Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power (2082) to deepen cooperation on wind energy projects across Saudi Arabia , Uzbekistan , and other parts of Central and Eastern Asia , POWERLINE reports\nThe partnership encompasses the supply of wind turbines, technology transfer, and long-term operations and maintenance support. In Saudi Arabia , the companies plan to establish local manufacturing capacity for essential turbine components in line with the country’s Vision 2030 strategy, which seeks to localise renewable energy production and diversify the economy away from oil.\nAccording to the report, in Uzbekistan , the focus will shift towards building facilities for the production of concrete towers and blades to strengthen local supply chains and boost domestic participation in the renewables sector. The two companies will also assess joint development prospects in China , reflecting their ambition to expand cooperation beyond regional boundaries.\nThe agreement comes shortly after ACWA Power unveiled a $10bn financing plan to support new renewable and energy storage projects worldwide, underscoring the accelerating pace of global clean energy investment.\n© 2025 bne IntelliNews, source Magazine\n© Acquiremedia - 2025",
