  "text": "HADLEY — Federal prosecutors charged a Hadley man Wednesday with unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition one day after an FBI-led raid on his home Tuesday.\nJacob Miller of Hockanum Road was expected to appear in federal court Wednesday, according to documents. His birth year was given as 1982. Agents didn’t disclose a birth date.\nAgents told a federal judge they found Miller with 50 rounds of ammunition in a bedside table and six guns in a locked safe.\nMiller shouldn’t have had any of it because of his criminal history, the FBI said. On Feb. 9, 2004, Miller was convicted of two charges in Hampshire Superior Court. He was convicted of one count of possession of child pornography and was sentenced to seven years of probation.\nHe was also convicted of two counts of possession of an explosive device and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a house of correction and 10 years of probation.\nOn April 7, 2012, he was found in violation of his probation and his term of probation was extended to April 7, 2019.\nOn Jan 26, 2018, Miler’s probation was terminated, according to court papers.",
