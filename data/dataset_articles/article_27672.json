  "text": "Prince William's Earthshot Prize honours global climate innovation projects\nLaunched in 2020 by Prince William and The Royal Foundation, the Earthshot Prize returned to highlight climate projects presented as practical paths to transition. The prince was attending the ceremony before travelling on to COP30. The ceremony opened in a festive tone with samba and global pop performances, but the atmosphere turned more focused as the winners were revealed, with the strongest applause for a Brazilian AI-driven reforestation start-up and a Bangladeshi group helping communities facing extreme weather. Bogota was recognised for cleaner air policies, while Lagos Fashion Week highlighted sustainable craft-based design. A UN treaty to protect high seas ecosystems also stood out. There are five Earthshot categories: protecting and restoring nature, cleaning the air, reviving the oceans, building a waste-free world and fixing the climate, all aimed at driving major environmental progress by 2030.",
