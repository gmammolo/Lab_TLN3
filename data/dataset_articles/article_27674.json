  "text": "Australia’s solar boom has gone so far into overdrive that the government is now planning to give away electricity for free. Starting mid-2026, millions of households across New South Wales, South-East Queensland, and South Australia will get three hours of free power every day, courtesy of a new Solar Sharer scheme.\nThe plan comes after solar generation began regularly outpacing daytime demand, pushing wholesale prices near zero – or even below it. With more than four million homes now topped with panels, the grid is practically drowning in midday sunshine. Instead of wasting that energy, the government decided to pay people in the best possible currency: free electricity.\nUnder the program, households won’t need rooftop panels to qualify. They’ll just need a smart meter and to opt into a participating energy plan. The free-power window will likely land around the middle of the day, when solar output peaks. It’s an open invitation to run the dishwasher, charge an EV, or crank up the air conditioning – all without paying a cent. As news.com.au put it, “households are being rewarded for using the sun when it’s shining.”\nEnergy Minister Chris Bowen described the move as a way to make sure “every last ray of sunshine is powering our homes.” He also said the initiative would take pressure off the grid by shifting electricity use away from the evening peak. That means fewer blackouts, less need for expensive infrastructure, and lower overall costs for everyone.\nStill, not everyone’s cheering. The Australian Energy Council warned that the details are thin and that retailers weren’t properly consulted. Critics worry about how the cost of “free power” will be absorbed, especially during non-solar hours when demand spikes again. Others question whether poorer households – often those without smart meters – will actually benefit.\nDespite the skepticism, the math behind the policy makes sense. In many areas, Australia’s renewable energy generation has grown faster than storage capacity, meaning excess solar power is regularly curtailed or sold for almost nothing. Giving it away for free during those hours helps balance supply, cuts waste, and boosts public goodwill at the same time.\nIf all goes well, the Solar Sharer scheme will expand nationwide by 2027, turning Australia into the first country where the problem isn’t paying too much for energy – it’s having too much of it. As The Guardian noted, it’s a simple idea with a big message: in the land of endless sun, the new luxury isn’t air conditioning – it’s knowing you can leave it running guilt-free.",
