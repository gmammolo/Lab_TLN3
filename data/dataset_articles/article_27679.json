  "text": "The Clean Sky 2 Passenger Cabin Demonstrator features biocomposite interior panels plus myriad other components and systems, enabling a full suite of tests, such as those conducted at Fraunhofer facilities (right) . Source | Clean Aviation, Leonardo, Fraunhofer\nThe Pax Cabin Demonstrator — developed under the Clean Sky 2 Regional Aircraft (REG) Integrated Aircraft Demonstrator Platform (IADP) — showcases sustainable, passenger-focused cabin innovations for regional turboprop aircraft, combining lightweight structures, environmentally friendly materials and human-centric design. Results include:\nA weight reduction of 8% for major cabin components, which contributes to long-term fuel savings — up to 22% over a 30-year aircraft lifespan — and direct reduction in CO ₂ emissions. Successful Integration of eco-friendly, biocomposite panels met stringent aviation flammability and safety standards, offering a low-impact alternative to conventional materials. These panels would reduce 75 megatons of CO ₂ emissions over 20 years for next-gen aircraft. CW reported on this development in 2018 . With completion of the Pax Cabin Demonstrator, this program’s success is now reported in Clean Aviation’s June 2025 newsletter . This ground-based test platform simulates the real-world interior environment of a regional turboprop aircraft and showcases how future cabins can enhance passenger wellbeing while slashing environmental impact.",
