  "text": "The Tamil Nadu Electric Vehicle Policy 2019 granted a 100 per cent road tax exemption for all categories of electric vehicles — until December 2022. Electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem players are eagerly awaiting the Tamil Nadu government’s decision on extending the road tax exemption for battery-powered vehicles, as industry stakeholders believe it will be a key enabler for accelerating EV adoption in the state.The Tamil Nadu Electric Vehicle Policy 2019 granted a 100 per cent road tax exemption for all categories of electric vehicles — including two- and three-wheelers, cars, buses, and commercial vehicles — until December 2022.Responding to industry requests, the current DMK government extended the benefit, issuing an order that provided a 100 per cent motor vehicle tax exemption for electric vehicles registered between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2025.With EV adoption in the state still relatively low, ecosystem players have urged the government to extend the exemption further, noting that the absence of such incentives could discourage potential buyers and create viability challenges for charging operators and related businesses.The Indian Charge Point Operators Association (ICPOA) has written to State Industries Minister T. R. B. Raaja, seeking an extension of the road tax exemption until the state achieves at least a 20 per cent EV adoption level.“For a considerable period, Tamil Nadu’s EV adoption has trailed other progressive states such as Karnataka, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Kerala. In fact, until 2024, the state’s adoption rate remained below the national average,” said Karthikeyan Palanisamy, Director, ICPOA.Encouragingly, Tamil Nadu’s EV adoption is now gaining momentum, reaching approximately 7.8 per cent in 2025. While still below the national average, this marks a significant improvement from previous years when adoption was under 5 per cent. “This upward trend clearly indicates growing public acceptance of electric mobility,” he added.While Tamil Nadu has emerged as a leading destination for EV manufacturing, it must also accelerate EV adoption to match its industrial leadership, noted a senior executive from a leading electric three-wheeler company.V. Arun Roy, Industries Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, confirmed that the department has received a memorandum from an industry association requesting an extension of the road tax exemption. “However, no discussions have been held so far regarding an extension,” he said.",
