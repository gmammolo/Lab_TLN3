  "text": "5 hours ago As autumn begins in Ames, Iowa, local gardeners are encouraged to compost leaves and yard debris. Composting recycles organic waste and improves garden soil. It is a sustainable practice for both the environment and home gardens.\nAaron Steil, a horticulture specialist with ISU Extension and Outreach, explains that composting turns organic matter into humus. Humus is a soil amendment that helps soil structure and water retention. To build a compost pile, Steil suggests mixing carbon-rich materials, such as dried leaves and straw, with nitrogen-rich items like vegetable scraps and fresh grass clippings. The recommended carbon-to-nitrogen ratio is about 30 to 1.\nCompost piles should be at least three feet in each direction to keep heat. Regular turning helps maintain airflow and moisture. A three-bin system is useful: one bin for collecting materials, one for active composting, and one for finished compost.\nSteil notes that fall materials are often high in carbon and low in nitrogen. Gardeners should add more green materials or a small amount of nitrogen fertilizer to help decomposition. Shredding materials increases surface area for microbes. The pile should be as moist as a wrung-out sponge. Steil advises against composting meat, dairy, pet waste, weed seeds, or diseased plants. Most home compost piles do not reach the temperatures needed to kill pathogens and weed seeds.\nAfter several months, finished compost should look dark and crumbly with an earthy smell. It can be used to top-dress lawns, mulch trees, or improve garden beds for spring planting. Compost adds some nutrients, but its main benefit is increasing organic matter. This improves soil structure, aeration, and nutrient retention.\nSteil says that well-made compost supports soil microbes and helps gardens grow. He encourages gardeners to start or expand composting in the fall.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
