  "text": "ILLEGAL ‘CANDIES’ A tip from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency led to the seizure of 4,491 ecstasy tablets hidden in boxes of gummy candies from Belgium on April 2. —Contributed photo\nMANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Customs (BOC) said on Wednesday that it intercepted a parcel containing P7.6 million worth of ecstasy tablets concealed in boxes of food items at the Port of Clark in Pampanga.\nIn a news release, the BOC said the package, which included ecstasy tablets, or “party drugs,” hidden inside boxes of gummy candies along with nondrug items such as Belgian waffle biscuits, arrived from Brussels, Belgium, on April 2. It was bound for Quezon City.\nArticle continues after this advertisement The operation was based on a tip from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) about the incoming shipment. It was carried out by the Port of Clark-Customs Anti-Illegal Drug Task Force in coordination with the Philippine National Police-Aviation Security Group. Also involved were the National Bureau of Investigation-Pampanga District Office, the Department of Justice, and Barangay Dau officials in Mabalacat City.\nREAD: P7.6-M ‘ecstasy’ intercepted at Port of Clark\nSniff test Customs examiners and PDEA operatives conducted a K-9 sniff test of the parcel, which indicated there were illegal substances inside, leading to an inspection.\nThe package was found to contain seven boxes of gummy candies. Hidden among the candies were 4,491 suspected ecstasy tablets.\nA chemical analysis conducted by the PDEA confirmed the tablets contained methylenedioxymethamphetamine, a prohibited drug under Republic Act No. 9165, or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, as amended.\n“This operation sends a clear and strong message: The Port of Clark will not be a gateway for illegal drugs. Let this be a firm warning to smugglers and consignees attempting to exploit our borders,” said District Collector Jairus Reyes.\nYour subscription could not be saved. Please try again.",
