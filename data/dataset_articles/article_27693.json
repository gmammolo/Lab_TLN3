  "text": "7 hours ago Iowa State University (ISU) Dining is working to reduce food waste at its 20 campus service locations. The department focuses on efficient ingredient use, menu planning, composting, and community partnerships. Karen Rodekamp, ISU’s director of dining, said the strategy starts with careful planning, including writing precise recipes and avoiding over-ordering.\nISU Dining’s waste reduction plan has three main parts: forecasting, batch cooking, and menu engineering. Menus are planned a semester ahead, with changes made up to two weeks before service based on recent data. Associate dining director Paige Ermer said the first month of each semester involves some guesswork, but predictions improve as patterns develop. The team considers factors like weather, campus events, and academic schedules to better estimate demand and reduce surplus.\nISU Dining also responds to changing student preferences. For example, the popularity of certain meats can change from year to year. Food is prepared in large batches, usually serving 100 portions. This method helps use ingredients efficiently and allows leftovers to be used in other dishes. It also helps with storage and reduces spoilage.\nStaff are trained to prepare food efficiently, minimizing waste from inedible parts. These parts are composted. In 2023, the university processed over 200 tons of food waste through its composting program. Compost is collected from four main dining locations and used for campus landscaping and agricultural projects.\nSometimes, unexpected demand causes menu items to run out. In these cases, ISU Dining substitutes similar items to ensure students have options. The team keeps three days’ worth of inventory to adapt quickly. These efforts aim to improve resource use and reduce environmental impact.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
