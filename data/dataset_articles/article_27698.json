  "text": "November Double Feature: Celebrate and Learn with Our Bee Community!!\nWe’re excited to bring you a special “double feature” this November, blending in-person camaraderie with virtual exploration of bee history online. Whether you’re joining us face-to-face or from afar, these events are perfect for bee enthusiasts, hobbyists, and anyone passionate about pollination and our buzzing friends.\nMark your calendars for our November general meeting, shifting to Friday, November 7th at 6:00 PM due to availability at the County Agriculture Center. This gathering is all about celebration and community—come share stories about your hives, swap tips on overwintering bees, and enjoy festive treats (honey-infused delights encouraged!).\nIf you entered samples in our recent Honey Tasting Festival fundraiser, those marked for return will be available for pickup. We’ll also take time to recognize and thank the dedicated volunteers who made the event a sweet success. Plus, this is your opportunity to provide valuable feedback on how we can improve future fundraisers—your ideas could shape our next big buzz!\nRemember, we won’t be holding a meeting in December, so don’t miss this chance to connect before the holidays. Dress comfortably, bring a snack to share, and let’s make it a hive of activity!",
