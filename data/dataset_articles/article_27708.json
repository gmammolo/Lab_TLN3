  "text": "The Flying Squirrel LIFE project brought together researchers and city planners to protect one of the country’s most iconic yet endangered forest species.\nThe Siberian flying squirrel ( Pteromys volans ) has a range that stretches from northern Europe through Asia, but within the EU it is found only in Finland and Estonia.\nThe project focused on Espoo, a municipality just west of Helsinki, where rapid urban growth is reshaping the landscape. “By 2060, Espoo could have 20,000 more residents than today,” says project manager Laura Lundgren. “But the city must still have room for diverse nature. In this ambitious project, we learned that urban development and the protection of flying squirrels are possible at the same time.”\nResearchers found that careful city planning works: flying squirrels were seen using the very forest corridors and “jumping posts” designed for them. The animals even proved more adaptable than expected, nesting in pine trees and visiting apple trees in courtyards. Espoo will continue to plant trees, maintain habitat routes and monitor the species for at least 20 more years.",
