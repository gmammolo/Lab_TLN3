  "text": "Pioneering Climate-Action Project Continues to Eliminate Super Pollutants at Scale\n- Covestro’s nitrous oxide abatement project surpasses 10M carbon credit milestone\n- Emissions abatement equivalent to removing 2.3M gas-powered cars from the road for a year\n11052025_Covestro-10M-Carbon-Credit-Milestone\nPITTSBURGH, November 5, 2025 – Covestro, a world-leading supplier of high-tech polymer materials, and ClimeCo, a global leader in decarbonization, announced a significant milestone with a long-standing nitrous oxide (N₂O) abatement project at Covestro’s Baytown, Texas facility, which is operated and maintained by LSB Industries, Inc. (LSB). The abatement project surpassed 10 million carbon credits issued – a milestone equivalent to approximately 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) abated since December 2010.\n\"Covestro’s abatement efforts on our nitric acid unit eliminate nitrous oxide at its source and create permanent and irreversible emissions reductions that not only benefit the environment, but also benefit local communities by improving air quality,” said Victor Ortega, Baytown site manager and senior vice president of Performance Materials and Operations, Covestro LLC. “Nitrous oxide has 273 times more global warming potential than CO₂1, so we are incredibly proud to be part of a project that delivers lasting, measurable impact and sets a standard for industrial sustainability.\"\nThrough this initiative, the N₂O abatement project has abated more than 36,000 metric tons of N₂O-- the equivalent to removing more than 2.3 million gas-powered cars from the road for one year2. These reductions are verified under the Climate Action Reserve's (CAR) N₂O Abatement Protocol. CAR is a reputable carbon registry, ensuring integrity and transparency in global carbon markets.\n“This has been a great collaborative effort between Covestro, ClimeCo, and our entire LSB Baytown team,” said Michael Griffin, general manager of LSB, the operator of the nitric acid plant at the Covestro Baytown site. “I’m extremely proud of the work we’ve done to support Covestro’s decarbonization efforts and am excited to explore other potential opportunities with Covestro.”\nNow in its 15th year of operation, Covestro’s Baytown site N₂O abatement project remains one of the longest-running and most impactful industrial N₂O abatement projects in the U.S. With this abatement, the super pollutant, N₂O, is permanently destroyed at the point of generation, preventing it from ever reaching the atmosphere.\n“We are proud to work alongside Covestro as they continue their incredible sustainability journey,” said Erika Schiller, SVP of Project Development at ClimeCo. “As the largest developer of N₂O abatement projects in the U.S., we’re excited to continue setting the standard for high-integrity, high-impact climate solutions that also drive business value.”\nAbout Covestro:\nCovestro is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of high-quality polymer materials and their components.
