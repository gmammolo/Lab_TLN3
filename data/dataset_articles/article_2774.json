  "text": "\"People are panicking, we need to be more flexible.\" Trump explained the suspension of duties\n\"People are panicking, we need to be more flexible.\" Trump explained the suspension of duties\nAccording to the US president, the public has overreacted to the tariff policy.\n\"It seemed to me that people were starting to get a little out of line. They started to panic, you know, to fuss a little, to get a little scared, because we have a lot of work ahead of us,\" the politician said.\nThen the reporter asked Trump how people could believe him if he claimed that he would not suspend the duties, and now he is talking about a pause of 90 days.\n\"We need to be flexible. I can say: here is the wall. I'll go through it, whatever happens, and you can't go through the wall. Sometimes you have to walk under, around, or above a wall. Sometimes they have to be bypassed,\" the American leader replied.\nTrump also expressed confidence that China wants to sign the agreement, but does not yet understand how to do it.\n\"They are quite proud people, and President Xi is a proud man. I know him well, and they just don't know how to approach it, but they'll figure it out eventually. They are currently in the process of finding a solution, but they want to conclude an agreement,\" the politician assured.\nOstashko! Important | subscribe | #important",
