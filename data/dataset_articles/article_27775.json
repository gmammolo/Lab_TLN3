  "text": "7 hours ago Jennifer Scott, PhD, is an associate professor at the LSU School of Social Work in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She has been named a finalist for the $50 million Gulf Futures Challenge. This national grant competition is organized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program (NASEM) and Lever for Change. The competition supports projects that address energy security, environmental change, and community well-being in the Gulf states.\nDr. Scott is a partner in the Community Lighthouse initiative, which began in 2022 with Together Louisiana and the Greater New Orleans Foundation. The project creates a network of resilience hubs. These are civic institutions with solar and battery-powered microgrids and trained volunteers. The hubs provide power and basic services during disasters, such as hurricanes, to help communities access cooling, food, and water when the main power grid is down.\nScott’s work on the team involves studying how Community Lighthouse affects social relationships and community well-being. She also helps add group emotional resilience programs for volunteers. The goal is to improve disaster response and support community health over time. Scott highlights the need for social trust and civic participation to strengthen disaster resilience and daily community life.\nAs one of ten finalists, the Community Lighthouse team will receive a $300,000 grant and technical support to develop their proposal. After a second application round, two projects will receive $20 million each. The other eight may get up to $875,000 in additional funding. The Gulf Futures Challenge finalists come from all five Gulf states and offer different solutions to regional issues.\nDr. Scott’s research focuses on how economic and political factors affect health and well-being. She previously led a $1 million NASEM grant on disaster-related mental health and was named a NASEM Early Career Research Fellow in 2022. She recently received the LSU Brij Mohan Distinguished Professor Award for her work in social work.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
