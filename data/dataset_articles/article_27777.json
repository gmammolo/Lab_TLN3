  "text": "Nigeria will be among the countries to benefit from a $100 million fresh methane investment, a Reuters report has said.\nOn Thursday, former New York City Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg announced a $100 million investment to boost collection of methane monitoring data from a global network of satellites.\nThe investment will also support policy efforts by nine countries, including Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Nigeria, as well as U.S. states like California and New Mexico, to curb methane leaks.\n“Ten years on from the Paris Agreement, we now have the technology and the international momentum to act quickly and effectively against coal and methane – the decisive front in the battle against climate change,” said Macron, who supports the initiative.\nBrazil has urged countries to ditch the idea of making new promises, and instead fulfill the hundreds of pledges already made toward efforts to rein in planet-warming emissions and finance life-saving solutions to extreme weather and other dangerous impacts of a warming world.\nOne of those measures – a COP26 deal to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030 – is far off track.\nREAD ALSO: Bloomberg Invests $100M In Reducing Methane Leaks\nWhile scientists have urged countries to halt emissions of the potent greenhouse gas as a first step in tackling warming, methane emissions have risen since the 2021 pledge was made at the U.N. summit in Glasgow.\nDozens of country leaders will gather on Thursday in Brazil’s Amazon city of Belem ahead of the annual U.N. summit on climate change, hoping to advance progress despite growing concerns that multilateral cooperation is on the brink.\nThe COP30 conference marks three decades since global climate negotiations began. In that time, countries have curbed the projected climb in emissions somewhat – but not enough to prevent what scientists consider extreme global warming in the next few decades.\nOver two days, Brazil’s COP30 presidency has lined up 53 heads of state to deliver speeches, along with more than 40 subnational leaders. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is expected to be among them.\nMissing from the lineup are the leaders of four of the world’s five most-polluting economies – China, the United States, India, and Russia – with only the leader of the European Union showing up.\nBut unlike the others, the climate-denying U.S. administration has opted to send no one to the talks.\nSome said the absence of the U.S. may free countries to discuss action without any one player dominating the outcome.\n“Without the U.S. present, we can actually see a real multilateral conversation happening,” said Pedro Abramovay, vice president of programs at Open Society Foundations and a former justice minister under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.\nHe noted that Lula, in general, had been engaging with leaders outside of Latin America in China, Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe on the topic.\nOn Thursday, Lula planned to hold bilateral meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, after meeting one-on-one on Wednesday with the Chinese vice premier and leaders from Finland and the European Union.\n“In a moment in which a lot of people are kind of claiming the death of multilateralism, I think there is a new space for a multilateralism that is not built in a top-down way from powerful countries towards poor countries,” Abramovay told Reuters.",
