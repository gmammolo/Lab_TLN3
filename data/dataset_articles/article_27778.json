  "text": "Viral\nDelhi Man Builds DIY Air Purifier For Rs 2,000 At Home; ‘AQI Reached Below 50 In 15 Minutes’\nA Delhi man’s Reddit post went viral, as per which he allegedly made a DIY air purifier at his home, which ended up bringing the AQI to below 50, from 380 in less than 15 minutes! Allegedly, the entire thing was built for just Rs 2,000.\nBelieve it or not– but it seems that Delhi’s ‘air situation’ is so bad that people are making their own air purifiers at home– for better survival! Taking to Reddit, a man shared pictures of his DIY air purifier that he allegedly built at his home. What was further impressive was that he allegedly used only Rs 2,000 for making the device. As per the post, the DIY actually was a success, as it managed to bring the AQI from 380 to below 50– in less than 15 minutes! As per the Reddit post, the man used a 150mm Exhaust fan, which cost him Rs 750, along with a HEPA filter from Amazon for Rs 1000. He also used Switch and Regulator + Wire, which were worth Rs 65, and a card board and a glue gun, which were for Rs 150. All in all, the DIY was a hit, resulting in the Reddit post going viral.\nMost netizens appreciated the efforts, while some commented on how they too want to try something similar.\nFor those not aware, Delhi is currently NOT the place to be, as the National capital, along with the NCR, is experiencing a ‘clean air crisis’. As per SAFAR- AQI, the AQI for today, November 06, stands at 306, which stands under the ‘Very Poor’ category.\nTimes Now could not confirm the details and the authenticity of the\npost.Check out the viral post:\n“I Built my Personal Air Purifier for 2000 INR,” the post read.\n“So I built this air purifier using exhaust fan and hepa filter and it is working great, even better than the phillips one I have.\nItems used\n150mm Exhaust fan (750 INR)\nHEPA filter from Amazon (1000 INR)\nSwitch and Regulator + Wire (65 INR)\nCard board and Glue gun (150 INR)\nIt is able to bring 380 AQI to below 50 in less than 15 minutes at minimum fan speed.\nNote - Using my phillips air purifier in the background as sensor,” the post further read.\nThe posts were shared on Reddit, by the handle ‘shukrant25’. The post was shared yesterday and pulled more than 1K views from netizens.\nInternet's reactions:\n“Why write philips on it lmao, write your own name,” a user said. “Next day - this post is viral on Instagram ‘Reddit user made his own air purifier’. People love to talk about these breakthroughs but still don’t follow,” added another.\n“Air purifier is just a fan and a filter, that's it , just build a contraption that can make air flow through the air filter and you're done , that's it, it's not complicated like RO or something,” added another person.\n“Air purifiers aren't exactly rocket science...they're just a simple IN and OUT air flow through filters,” commented another person. “Share filter and fan link or details. I assume I'll also get the same results, as I don't have any solution to see the AQI difference,” added another.\nEnd Article\nPoorva Karki author\nI’m Poorva Karki and am working as a senior copy editor at Times Network.
