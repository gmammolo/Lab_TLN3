  "text": "Renewable- 2 min read\nIndia’s solar module manufacturing capacity to cross 165 GW by 2027: ICRA\nIt expects the country’s solar cell manufacturing capacity to expand sharply to about 100 GW by December 2027.\nIndia’s solar module manufacturing capacity is projected to cross 165 gigawatts (GW) by March 2027 from about 109 GW currently, according to credit rating agency\nThe expansion, driven by policy support such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), basic customs duty on imports, and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, could lead to overcapacity and squeeze margins for solar module makers.\nCurrent and projected\nHowever, annual\n“The operating profitability for ICRA’s sample set of domestic solar OEMs, which remained elevated at around 25 per cent in FY2025, is likely to moderate due to competitive pressures and overcapacity build-up,” said Ankit Jain, Vice-President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.\nJain added that while the ALMM requirement for cells from June 2026 will support local manufacturing, the cost of modules using domestic cells is expected to be higher by 3–4 cents per watt compared to those using imported cells.\nLanded cost of solar PV modules sourced from domestic OEMs (cents/watt) using imported PV cells\nExemptions and near-term outlook\nICRA noted that projects with bid submission dates before September 1, 2025, accounting for a pipeline of 45–50 GW, will be exempted from the use of ALMM-listed solar cells even if commissioned after June 2026. This will offer temporary support for module makers without integrated cell manufacturing capacity.\nHowever, bidding activity has slowed in recent months — a key factor to watch, according to the agency.\nLanded cost of solar PV modules (cents/watt) using domestic cells\nGlobal dependency and technology risks\nThe\nBackward integration into wafers and ingots demands significant capital and technical expertise, making project execution and stabilisation key challenges for Indian OEMs.\nICRA emphasised that while overcapacity could lead to industry consolidation, vertically integrated players with cell and module capabilities are better placed to withstand pricing pressures and protect margins over the long term.\nICRA.The expansion, driven by policy support such as the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM), basic customs duty on imports, and the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, could lead to overcapacity and squeeze margins for solar module makers.\nICRAadded that the country’ssolar cell manufacturingcapacity is expected to expand sharply to about 100 GW by December 2027 from 17.9 GW at present, as the implementation of ALMM List-II for solar PV cells from June 2026 prompts new investments by module original equipment manufacturers.Current and projected\nsolar PV moduleand cell manufacturing capacity in India (GW)However, annual\ndomestic solar installationsare expected to be about 45–50 GW, compared to a likely annual module output of 60–65 GW, signalling potential oversupply. The situation has been compounded by the recent imposition of US tariffs, which have curtailed exports and diverted supply to the domestic market.“The operating profitability for ICRA’s sample set of domestic solar OEMs, which remained elevated at around 25 per cent in FY2025, is likely to moderate due to competitive pressures and overcapacity build-up,” said Ankit Jain, Vice-President & Co-Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.\nJain added that while the ALMM requirement for cells from June 2026 will support local manufacturing, the cost of modules using domestic cells is expected to be higher by 3–4 cents per watt compared to those using imported cells.\nLanded cost of solar PV modules sourced from domestic OEMs (cents/watt) using imported PV cells\nExemptions and near-term outlook\nICRA noted that projects with bid submission dates before September 1, 2025, accounting for a pipeline of 45–50 GW, will be exempted from the use of ALMM-listed solar cells even if commissioned after June 2026. This will offer temporary support for module makers without integrated cell manufacturing capacity.\nHowever, bidding activity has slowed in recent months — a key factor to watch, according to the agency.\nLanded cost of solar PV modules (cents/watt) using domestic cells\nGlobal dependency and technology risks\nThe\nglobal solar manufacturingvalue chain remains dominated by China, with over 90 per cent share in polysilicon and wafer production, 85 per cent in cells, and 80 per cent in modules. India’s dependence on Chinese wafers and ingots poses risks, particularly if geopolitical restrictions disrupt technology or machinery supplies.Backward integration into wafers and ingots demands significant capital and technical expertise, making project execution and stabilisation key challenges for Indian OEMs.\nICRA emphasised that while overcapacity could lead to industry consolidation, vertically integrated players with cell and module capabilities are better placed to withstand pricing pressures and protect margins over the long term.",
