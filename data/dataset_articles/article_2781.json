  "text": "Deported man's family has message for White House\nThe family of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador is speaking out in a case that has garnered national attention. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia in March. The agency later said his detention resulted from an \"administrative error.\" On Friday, a federal judge in Greenbelt ordered the Trump administration to arrange for Abrego Garcia's return by midnight Monday. The U.S. Supreme Court paused the federal judge's order before Monday's deadline, and now, his legal fight remains in limbo. Some of his family spoke Wednesday at a news conference in Washington.\nWBAL flipped this story into WBAL-TV 11 Baltimore•40m\nJoin the flipboard community\nDiscover, collect, and share stories for all your interests\nSign up\nMore stories from Latin America\nThe Bulwarkflipped intoBulwark LatestConcentration Camps and the Deportation of American CitizensThere is no limiting principle for disappearing people into the Bukele gulag.

During a press event outside the White House, Bondi was asked about a segment on CBS’s 60 Minutes which uncovered evidence that three quarters of those shipped overseas actually had no public criminal record. The Attorney General doubled down that the migrants should never have been in the country in the first place and were violent criminals.
