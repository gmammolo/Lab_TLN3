  "text": "Normally, MCPR does not post GOFUNDME due to the amount of fraud we have found. But there are exceptions, especially when a scene is so bad that I know it is not someone trying to gain. Last Friday night, Joana Tores took her three children, Luis , age 8, Yadiel , age 15, and Addiel , age 12, to the McDonald’s on SH 242 near the HEB. As the kids left there with their Happy Meals, Ms. Tores turned onto SH 242 to head east. It was then that the intoxicated driver in a Toyota Tundra, traveling at a high rate of speed, slammed into the rear of the Tahoe, crushing it. Yadiel was in the front seat and suffered minor injuries.. Luis was in the third seat and was critically injured. Addiel was in the middle seat. He was also critically injured, with severe head trauma. MCHD transported the four to Memorial Hermann in The Woodlands. Addiel was then flown to Memorial Hermann in Houston, where he passed away on Sunday. The Tundra driver had no insurance. Ms. Tores had only liability insurance. Just to see the scene with McDonald’s Happy Meals scattered throughout is nerve-racking and very upsetting, knowing an intoxicated driver had caused the end of a Happy Day. DPS investigated the crash. Intoxication Manslaughter and Intoxication Assault charges are expected. Please keep the family in your prayers.\nGOFUNDME-CLICK HERE -PLEASE HELP",
