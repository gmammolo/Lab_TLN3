  "text": "Malta Developers’ Association Welcomes Decision To Turn White Rocks Into A National Park\nThe Malta Developers’ Association has welcomed Prime Minister Robert Abela’s announcement that White Rocks will be transformed into a national park.\n“The MDA’s position has always been that the priority use of government land should be for projects that serve the wider public interest, create open spaces and enhance quality of life,” the MDA said.\n“The decision on White Rocks is a positive step in this direction, restoring a long-neglected area and returning it to the community after decades of abandonment.”\nWhite Rocks has long been earmarked as a potential development site since it was abandoned in 1995. However, Abela announced this week that the government intends to transform it into a park.\nThe MDA said that the regeneration of White Rocks as a public park should serve as a model for the restoration of disused state property through well-structured public-private partnerships.\n“Such collaboration would ensure that the park is properly planned, financed and maintained to high standards, and that it remains accessible and safe for all,” they said.\n“The MDA reiterates its readiness to work closely with the authorities to support regeneration projects that enhance Malta’s urban and coastal landscape, promote good planning practice, and serve the public interest.”\nPhoto left: MDA President Michael Stivala (Photo: NET), Right: White Rocks (Photo: TVM)",
