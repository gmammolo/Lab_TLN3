  "text": "The KwaLembe Upgrade of Bulk Water Supply Project, located under Umdoni Local Municipality, is well under way – currently sitting at 40% construction progress.\nAccording to Ugu, this project is a key step towards improving reliable water supply to communities in KwaLembe and surrounding areas. The nearest town to the project location is Umzinto.\nThe primary objective of the project is to provide an economically sustainable and self-sufficient water project with minimum external financial assistance for the operation and maintenance component to the rural community of KwaLembe.\nThe secondary objective is to develop institutional capacity within the community to run the water scheme by operating and maintaining the scheme in a sustainable manner and also to create both temporary and permanent employment.\nUgu said that the community has a desperate need for a safe and reliable source of potable water.\nFor many years, the water supply to the KwaLembe area was from the Mkomazi River in the north and from springs and non-perennial streams in the south. The springs and non-perennial streams often dry up during the dry seasons, which leave locals with only the river as their main water source.\nAlthough the river always has water, pollution is often the problem.\nThe water project is expected to be completed in June next year, and hopefully, it will help strengthen water infrastructure and improve service delivery in the area.\nThe project is expected to be completed by mid-2026.
