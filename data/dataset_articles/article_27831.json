  "text": "MOUNT PLEASANT — After nearly a decade in the works, a new set of bike lanes will be unveiled along Coleman Boulevard.\nMount Pleasant’s Shem Creek area is a popular waterfront with restaurants, boardwalks and launching points for boats. A bridge overlooks the creek, where manatees and dolphins sometimes grace kayakers with their presence, and a recently-added bronze sculpture of the late shrimper Wayne Magwood stands.\nAdjacent to this lively pocket of recreation is Coleman Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that carries traffic coming off the Ravenel Bridge into Mount Pleasant. The cars zipping by have made it a stretch of road that even the most confident of cyclists avoid.\n“For me, Coleman Boulevard has traditionally been terrifying,” said Katie Zimmerman, executive director of Charleston Moves, a nonprofit group that advocates for bike and pedestrian infrastructure in Charleston County. Zimmerman’s bicycle is her primary mode of transportation.\nBut beginning this month, cyclists will have a wide, five-foot lane dedicated to bikes, marked by vivid green paint on the roadway to ride on.\n“Having these bike lanes striped, it's a game changer,” Zimmerman said.\nThe new bike lanes span Coleman Boulevard from Pelzer Drive to Mill Street in the Old Village. Now, cyclists can ride for an uninterrupted 1.5 miles from Houston Northcutt Boulevard to Pherigo Street, near Ben Sawyer Boulevard.\nThe bike lanes through Shem Creek have been a long time coming.\nThe town was awarded a grant from the S.C. Department of Transportation in 2016 for the work but faced delays in permitting and design. Crews began construction on the $1.2 million project in April and wrapped up in October. Leaders will officially cut the ribbon on the finished work on Nov. 7, welcoming cyclists on the new bike lanes.\nJames Aton, the town’s deputy director for transportation, said the long-awaited bike lanes are another step in achieving the connectivity goals Mount Pleasant has been working toward for a long time.\nLast year, the town celebrated the completion of a $10 million job meant to make the intersection of Coleman Boulevard and Patriots Point Boulevard safer for pedestrians and cyclists. Progress on Mount Pleasant Way, a town-wide network of multi-use paths, slowly crawls forward, too. Several spurs are in various stages of design, permitting and construction.\n“This is a huge safety improvement that fills a critical gap in the previous bicycle network,” Aton said. “We're continuing to move forward with other segments along the corridor to create that cohesive and complete bicycle network.”\nThe addition of the lanes is a critical segment for Charleston Moves’ Battery2Beach plan, Aton said. That plan seeks to connect six municipalities in Charleston County with sidewalks and bike paths.\n“I’m very excited it's coming to a close here and look forward to seeing it and riding on it myself,” Aton said.",
