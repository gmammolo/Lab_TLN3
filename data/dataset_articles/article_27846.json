  "text": "There’s something magical about discovering a lakeside eatery where the fish on your plate was likely swimming in the waters you’re gazing at just hours earlier.\nErnie’s on Gull Lake is that kind of place – a rustic haven where Minnesota’s beloved walleye transforms from lake-dwelling creature to the star of what many locals passionately defend as the state’s finest fish sandwich.\nNestled along the shores of East Gull Lake, this unassuming spot has mastered the delicate art of casual dining excellence without a hint of pretension.\nYou know those places that feel like a warm hug from an old friend?\nThat’s Ernie’s – except this friend happens to make a walleye sandwich that might just change your life.\nThe journey to Ernie’s is part of its charm, winding through the picturesque Brainerd Lakes region of central Minnesota.\nAs you approach, the first thing you’ll notice is the classic northwoods cabin aesthetic – weathered wood siding, a sturdy roof built to withstand Minnesota winters, and a setting that practically screams “lake life.”\nThe restaurant sits right on the water’s edge, with towering trees providing dappled shade over the outdoor seating area.\nGolf carts are parked nearby – a testament to the restaurant’s popularity with players from nearby courses who’ve learned that few things satisfy post-round hunger like Ernie’s fare.\nThe building itself isn’t trying to impress anyone with architectural flourishes or trendy design elements.\nInstead, it embraces its identity as a laid-back lake country establishment where the focus remains squarely on two things: the stunning water views and the exceptional food that emerges from the kitchen.\nA hand-painted sign welcomes you, and if you’re lucky enough to visit during summer, you might spot boats pulling up to the dock, their captains and passengers drawn by the siren call of that famous walleye.\nPush open the door and you’re immediately enveloped in an atmosphere that feels authentically Minnesotan.\nThe interior strikes that perfect balance between rustic charm and comfortable dining space.\nExposed wooden beams cross the ceiling, their weathered appearance suggesting they’ve witnessed countless celebrations, first dates, and family gatherings over the years.\nLarge windows line the wall facing the lake, ensuring that almost every table enjoys a view worth writing home about.\nThe dining room features simple wooden tables and chairs – nothing fancy, but perfectly suited to the environment.\nRed accents pop against the natural wood tones, adding warmth to the space.\nA small merchandise area displays t-shirts and hats – the universal sign of a place popular enough that people want to take a piece of it home with them.\nThe walls serve as a gallery of local history – old photographs, fishing memorabilia, and the occasional mounted fish create a museum-like quality that invites you to lean in for a closer look between bites.\nYou might notice families who appear to be on their annual lake vacation sitting alongside locals who greet the staff by name.\nThat’s the magic of Ernie’s – it simultaneously feels like a special occasion destination and a comfortable neighborhood joint.\nWhile the setting might draw you in, it’s the menu that will keep you coming back.\nErnie’s offerings read like a greatest hits album of lakeside comfort food, with the walleye sandwich as the platinum single everyone can’t stop talking about.\nThe menu itself is straightforward and unpretentious – a single page that doesn’t need flashy descriptions or culinary buzzwords to impress.\nThe star attraction – that legendary walleye sandwich – features a lightly breaded walleye fillet served with citrus aioli and arugula on a soft bun.\nThe fish is fresh, flaky, and cooked to perfection – crisp on the outside while maintaining that delicate, almost buttery interior that makes walleye so prized among freshwater fish.\nBut limiting yourself to just the walleye sandwich would be like visiting the Grand Canyon and only looking at it through a keyhole.\nThe walleye tacos offer another take on the local favorite, with beer-battered walleye nestled in soft tortillas with pico de gallo, broccoli slaw, and a zesty sauce that ties it all together.\nFor the truly committed, the pan-fried walleye entrée showcases the fish in its most glorious form – corn flour breaded, pan-fried to golden perfection, and served with snap peas and a sweet corn-bacon succotash that might make you consider moving to Minnesota permanently.\nBeyond the walleye (yes, there is life beyond walleye, even in Minnesota), the menu offers plenty of temptations.\nThe “Minnesota Dipper” features shaved prime rib, caramelized onions, mushrooms, garlic aioli, provolone, and au jus – a sandwich that would be the headliner at most other establishments.\nThe “Deer Hunter Blues” burger pays homage to the state’s hunting tradition with a housemade ground venison patty topped with blueberry bacon jam, arugula, provolone, and caramelized onions on a sourdough toast.\nFor starters, the soft pretzel bucket with beer cheese sauce and mustard has achieved minor celebrity status among regulars.\nThe “Potluck” – a hot dish dip with tater tots, ranch sour cream dip, buffalo sauce, and kettle chips – cleverly transforms Minnesota’s favorite communal meal format into a shareable appetizer.\nSeafood lovers might gravitate toward the peel and eat shrimp or mussels, while the tequila lime chicken nachos offer a zesty departure from the predominantly lake-inspired menu.\nEven the salads show thoughtful composition, with options like the roasted peach and prosciutto salad featuring charred endive, arugula, roasted peaches, prosciutto, toasted macadamia nuts, and goat cheese with a blueberry balsamic vinaigrette.\nLet’s circle back to that walleye sandwich, because it deserves its own spotlight.\nWhat makes this particular version worthy of its reputation as the state’s best?\nFirst, there’s the fish itself – sourced as locally and freshly as possible, often from the very waters visible from your table.\nThe breading is light enough to add texture without overwhelming the delicate flavor of the walleye.\nIt’s crisp rather than greasy, suggesting a kitchen team that understands the fine art of proper frying temperature.\nThe citrus aioli adds brightness that cuts through the richness of the fish without masking its natural flavor.\nRelated: The Home-Cooked Meals at this Minnesota Diner are so Good, You’ll Dream about Them for Weeks\nRelated: Relish in the Nostalgia at this Iconic Long-Running Restaurant in Minnesota\nThe peppery arugula provides a perfect counterpoint to the mild walleye, while the bun is soft enough to yield to each bite without disintegrating mid-sandwich.\nIt’s a study in balance – no single element dominates, allowing the star ingredient to shine while supporting players enhance the overall experience.\nServed with a side of house-made chips or fries, it’s a meal that satisfies deeply without leaving you feeling weighed down – perfect for those who plan to return to the lake for afternoon activities.\nLocals will tell you that the sandwich tastes even better when enjoyed on the outdoor patio, with the gentle lapping of Gull Lake providing the soundtrack to your meal.\nThey’re not wrong.\nWhile the cuisine rightfully takes center stage, the full Ernie’s experience extends beyond what’s on your plate.\nThe service embodies that distinctive Midwestern hospitality – friendly without being intrusive, attentive without hovering.\nServers often share recommendations with genuine enthusiasm, having personally sampled much of the menu themselves.\nDuring peak summer months, the restaurant hums with activity.\nFamilies fresh from swimming gather around tables, their hair still damp.\nCouples on date night clink glasses as the sun begins its descent over the lake.\nGroups of friends debate whether to order another round or save room for dessert (the correct answer is always both).\nThe outdoor seating area deserves special mention – a prime spot for dining during Minnesota’s precious warm months.\nTables positioned to maximize the lake view create an atmosphere that no interior designer could replicate.\nAs daylight fades, the space takes on a magical quality, with string lights twinkling overhead and the occasional loon call echoing across the water.\nFor those arriving by boat, the ability to dock and dine adds another layer of appeal to the Ernie’s experience.\nThere’s something undeniably special about approaching a restaurant from the water, tying up, and stepping directly onto shore with an appetite sharpened by a day on the lake.\nLike many Minnesota establishments, Ernie’s operates in harmony with the changing seasons.\nSummer brings the fullest expression of the restaurant’s charm, with long days allowing for extended hours of lakeside dining.\nThe patio buzzes with activity, and the kitchen works at full capacity to satisfy the influx of seasonal residents and tourists.\nFall transforms the experience with spectacular foliage reflecting in the lake’s surface.\nThe menu might incorporate more hearty options as temperatures drop, though the walleye remains a constant.\nWinter sees a shift in clientele to hardy locals and ice fishing enthusiasts who appreciate the warm refuge after hours spent on the frozen lake.\nThe views remain stunning, with snow-covered shores and ice-clad trees creating a monochromatic beauty visible through those large windows.\nSpring brings renewal, as the restaurant prepares for another busy season while early visitors enjoy the relative tranquility before summer’s rush.\nThis seasonal rhythm is part of what makes Ernie’s special – it’s not just a restaurant but a landmark that helps mark the passage of time for those connected to Gull Lake.\nIs Ernie’s on Gull Lake worth a special journey?\nFor Minnesota residents, the answer is an unequivocal yes.\nEven if you live hours away in the Twin Cities or elsewhere in the state, the combination of scenic beauty and exceptional food justifies the drive.\nFor visitors to the North Star State, including Ernie’s in your itinerary provides an authentic taste of Minnesota lake culture that tourist attractions can’t replicate.\nThe restaurant embodies the state’s natural bounty, culinary traditions, and laid-back hospitality in a single, accessible experience.\nIs the walleye sandwich truly the best in Minnesota?\nSuch claims are inherently subjective, but after your first bite, you’ll understand why so many locals are willing to die on that particular hill.\nAt minimum, it deserves a place in any serious conversation about the state’s finest fish preparations.\nWhat makes Ernie’s truly special isn’t just the quality of that signature dish, but how the entire experience comes together – the setting, the service, the sense of place.\nIt’s a restaurant that knows exactly what it is and executes its vision with confidence and consistency.\nIn a world of dining establishments constantly chasing trends, there’s something refreshing about a place that simply focuses on doing what it does best.\nErnie’s popularity means that during peak summer months, particularly weekends, you might encounter a wait for a table.\nArriving during off-peak hours or being flexible about indoor versus outdoor seating can improve your chances of being seated promptly.\nThe restaurant is family-friendly, making it suitable for diners of all ages.\nWhile the walleye gets most of the attention, don’t hesitate to explore other menu options – the kitchen shows the same care and attention to detail across its offerings.\nFor the full experience, time your visit to coincide with sunset, when the lake views reach peak magnificence and the outdoor seating area takes on a magical quality.\nFor more information about hours, seasonal specials, and events, visit Ernie’s website or Facebook page before planning your trip.\nUse this map to find your way to this lakeside gem and experience Minnesota’s beloved walleye in its most perfect form.\nWhere: 10424 Gull Point Rd, East Gull Lake, MN 56401\nSome places just get it right – that perfect alchemy of location, food, and atmosphere that creates something greater than the sum of its parts.\nErnie’s on Gull Lake is that rare spot where Minnesota’s natural beauty and culinary heritage meet on a plate, best enjoyed with a
