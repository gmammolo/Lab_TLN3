  "text": "Achieving net zero: Cutting costs and carbon with sustainable devices\nVital role of end-user devices – and employee behavior – in reducing enterprise emissions\nIn this point of view, our experts Greg Bentham and Alan Connolly explore how organizations can better understand and mitigate the impact of employee devices and behavior on their overall emissions, and why addressing their digital carbon footprint is so valuable.\nImpact of employee devices on carbon footprint\nWith 92 percent of organizations aiming to achieve their net zero targets by 2040, leaders worldwide are seeking innovative ways to be sustainable and minimize carbon emissions. While data centers, vehicle fleets, and office spaces are often the primary focus, the carbon footprint of employee devices is frequently overlooked.\nConsider this: most employees are equipped with at least one company device, regardless of their work location. As these devices move through their life cycle – from manufacturing to usage to decommissioning – they contribute to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in various ways.\nHow to minimize the carbon footprint of your devices\nReducing the carbon impact of devices requires a comprehensive approach and a collective effort. Every decision you make throughout the device life cycle influences your carbon footprint. Here are some key considerations for shaping your sustainable devices strategy:\n- Understand the impact of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on the carbon footprint of your devices.\n- Choose suppliers with minimal carbon impact.\n- Select a catalog of devices that aligns with your sustainability strategy.\n- Build a circular economy for enterprise services.\nEmployee engagement: Your key to success\nYour employees interact with their devices daily, making their engagement crucial to the success of your sustainability strategy. Incorporate devices as a central component of your sustainable workplace strategy.\nDownload the PoV to learn how to integrate sustainable practices into your device ecosystem effectively.\nContact us to learn more about how you can make more sustainable device choices and engage your workforce in your organization’s net zero strategy.",
