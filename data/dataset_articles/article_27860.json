Collaboration showcased at Battery Show Europe event. EQS-News: LION E-Mobility AG / Key word(s): Alliance\nLION E-Mobility partners with Castrol to pioneer direct battery cooling for next generation PHEV and EV battery systems\n06.11.2025 / 10:57 CET/CEST\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nLION E-Mobility partners with Castrol to pioneer direct battery cooling for next ‑ generation PHEV and EV battery systems\nZug, November 6, 2025 - LION E-Mobility AG (LION; ISIN: CH0560888270), a leading manufacturer of battery packs for electric mobility and energy storage solutions, announces that its subsidiary LION Smart Production GmbH has partnered with Castrol to facilitate the development of a new cutting-edge battery module for high-performance EV applications, combining LION Smart’s direct battery‑cooling innovation with Castrol’s advanced thermal fluids and battery thermal management expertise.\nThe partnership aims to improve significantly battery thermal management for passenger cars, trucks and battery energy storage systems (BESS) worldwide, through direct battery cooling, a cutting‑edge approach that facilitates fast charging and discharging of battery cells that are submerged in a lightweight dielectric fluid. Castrol ON EV Thermal Fluids will be used to enable superior heat dissipation, enhance power density and improve battery lifespan and safety*.\nThis new battery module has been engineered to deliver advanced cooling. It features a modular design for homogeneous temperature distribution and minimal temperature gradient within the cell. The structure is configured to help maximise the active cooled contact surface, while a ‘single cell fuse’ reduces potential propagation from internal short circuit.\nAs a result of the innovations of this battery module, LION Smart has been able to significantly advance battery temperature management*. One consequence is that the battery module is able to improve the efficiency of plug‑in hybrids (PHEVs) due to higher levels of energy recuperation, greater power at a lower system cost and increased operational safety*.\nThe alliance with LION Smart is part of Castrol’s strategic focus on direct battery cooling technologies and battery fluid innovation. The collaboration was highlighted at the recent Battery Show Europe, where experts from Castrol and LION Smart demonstrated the technology in action, showcasing its potential to significantly enhance the performance of PHEV applications through more efficient cooling and superior thermal balance*.\nSeite 1 von 3 Seite 2 ►\nDiskutieren Sie über die enthaltenen Werte",
