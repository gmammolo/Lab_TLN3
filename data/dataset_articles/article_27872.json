  "text": "North Atlantic right whale numbers are up. Is there cause for optimism?\nThe estimated population of the critically endangered whale that traverses N.C. coastal waters has ticked up slightly for the fourth straight year. But what does that really mean?\nGareth McGrath\n- Large vessels must slow down off the Mid-Atlantic coast from November to April to protect endangered North Atlantic right whales.\n- The primary threats to the whales are collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear.\n- Despite a slight population increase, researchers express concern over low birth rates and ongoing threats.\nWRIGHTSVILLE BEACH | The start of November not only means turning the clocks back an hour, but also signifies the start of a roughly six-month window where large vessels off parts of the Mid-Atlantic coast again have to slow down to help protect the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration implements the go-slow zones for vessels larger than 65 feet to reduce the threat of vessel collisions, one of the top killers of the extremely rare marine mammal along with fishing gear entanglements.\nPrimarily located around the entrances to major ports, including Wilmington and Morehead City, and a continuous zone between Southeastern North Carolina down to the Georgia-Florida line, the speed zones extend about 15 miles or so offshore and limit large vessels to 10 knots, or 11.5 mph.\nThe move is one of the most significant steps regulators have taken in recent years to try and help protect the right whales, whose numbers have in the low hundreds for decades.\nBut highlighting the precarious state of the species, some researchers and environmentalists believe the federal government should be doing more.\nThe 'right' whale for hunting\nThe right whales migrate along the North Carolina coast from their summer feeding grounds off New England and the Canadian Maritimes to their winter breeding grounds off the U.S. Southeast.\nLike humpbacks, the North Atlantic right whale was a popular target for whalers, getting its name because it was the \"right\" whale for hunting due to its size and propensity to travel close to shore, making it easy to harvest and drag ashore.\nBut the right whale population was never large, and the whaling ban has only slowed − not stopped − its decline.\nThat's because what made the whale popular with hunters, its tendency to swim in shallow waters close to the coast, also has put the species into conflict with shipping vessels and fishermen. Now a new danger, climate change, is emerging. Waters in the Gulf of Maine, where the right whales spend their summer, have warmed, creating less favorable conditions for the whale's favorite food, zooplankton. That's prompted the zooplankton to move north into Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence, a much busier shipping corridor, and the whales have followed.\nThis challenging environment of trying to navigate ship strikes and entanglements with fishing gear, the two leading known killers of the whales, has seen the whale's population tumble.\nA rough start to 2025\nRight whales are notoriously slow breeders, with three years considered the normal time between births. And there are only believed to be around 70 female whales of breeding age left.\nThat makes every animal, especially mature females, vital, and 2024 wasn't a good year with five right whale deaths, 16 entanglements (10 of which had attached fishing gear), and eight vessel strikes, according to the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium.\nThe paucity of young animals joining the already minimal number of right whales out there comes as the Trump administration takes a much more critical stand on steps to protect endangered species and their habitats.\nIn April, Trump signed an executive order to \"immediately consider suspending, revising or rescinding regulations that overly burden America's commercial fishing, aquaculture and fish processing industries.\" That would include rules in place to limit the danger of right whales getting entangled in lobster and other fishing gear.\nThe Biden administration also is seen by some environmentalists as having let the right whale down. In the waning days of its time in office and with little hope Trump would adopt the regulation, the Biden administration scrapped a long-discussed proposal to make the seasonal go-slow requirements on vessels apply to boats as small as 35 feet when right whales were migrating through nearby waters.\nThe decision was welcomed by the boating industry and many coastal officials worried what the impacts of the go-slow order could have had on their tourism-dependent local economies, but lambasted by environmentalists who said small boats can be as much a threat to the highly endangered whales as larger sea-going vessels.\nLatest survey looking up?\nBut one positive sign is that the estimated number of right whales appears to be ticking up.\nAccording to the whale consortium, the 2024 latest population estimate was 384 whales − a 2.1% increase from the 2023 estimate.\nSo far in 2025, scientists also have logged no deaths, one new entanglement injury without attached fishing gear, and just one vessel strike, according to the consortium.\n\"The slight increase in the population estimate, coupled with no detected mortalities and fewer detected injuries than in the last several years, leaves us cautiously optimistic about the future of North Atlantic right whales,\" said Heather Pettis, who leads the right whale research program at the New England Aquarium and chairs the whale consortium, in a news release.\nStill, researchers warn many challenges remain for the critically endangered species. The 2025 calving numbers lagged behind what researchers had hoped for, with just eleven calves born − four to first-time mothers. That falls far short of the 20 needed for a “productive” season and well below the 50 needed annually for population recovery.\nThe Trump administration cutting many personnel and programs from NOAA in its push to shrink the government workforce also is seen as a threat to many of the safeguards put into place to help the whales.\n“With small population increases year to year, we still need strong protective measures for continued growth,\" Pettis said. \"We don’t want to take our foot off the gas when it comes to management and conservation efforts.”\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on X/Twitter.
