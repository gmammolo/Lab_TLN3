  "text": "Next Article\nNew deep-sea limpet species discovered on underwater log\nTechnology\nScientists exploring near Johnston Atoll just found a new deep-sea limpet species, Pectinodonta nautilus, hanging out on a decaying log 2,400 meters underwater.\nThe log wasn't just driftwood—it was home to 79 limpets and supported a whole mini-community of deep-sea life.\nDiscovery boosts biodiversity in the deep sea\nPectinodonta nautilus has a tough shell and big teeth for scraping wood, making it perfectly adapted to its unusual home.\nGenetic tests showed it's unlike any other known limpet in its family.\nThis discovery shows how even sunken logs can spark new species and boost biodiversity in the deep sea.",
