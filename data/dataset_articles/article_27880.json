  "text": "Cross Bar is a special piece of land for outdoors people in the Panhandle\nEditor's Note: Since the article was written, Potter County Commissioners have been working with the Federal Highway Administration and Friends of Cross Bar Special Land Management to plan and develop a stretch of road that will lead to the land. The Potter County Commissioners approved a modification of a fund transfer agreement at at their last meeting, held Oct. 22, to develop the road to the lead to the Cross Bar SRMA located north of Potter County. Cross Bar was awarded a $13 million match that must be raised by the community.\nLorie Van Ongevalle cried as her plane touched ground in flat, dry Amarillo.\n“There’s nothing out here,” lamented Van Ongevalle as she unpacked boxes for her move from Colorado to the Panhandle city.\nVan Ongevalle is an endurance horseback rider who competes in races over 50 miles long. As such, she needs long sections of trail where she can condition her horses for competition. She knew she was in for a culture shock moving from a state with lots of mountains, trails and public land. Although the nearby Palo Duro Canyon State Park and Lake Meredith National Recreation Area both have trails open to horses, they’re only a few miles long.\nNow, it’s been almost 30 years since that move. In that time, she’s found a little-known oasis of public land in the Panhandle: Cross Bar Special Recreation Management Area.\nIn the 1990s, a friend drove her 20 minutes north of town, to a bridge that crosses the Canadian River. They parked at the bridge and rode their horses up the riverbed to the property, which is the only federal Bureau of Land Management site in Texas.\nFor years now, the land has been a hidden gem for outdoor enthusiasts in the Panhandle. It’s home to a wide variety of wildlife, including pronghorn, rattlesnakes, bobcats, badgers, quail, foxes, mule deer, coyotes and even the occasional elk. As of last hunting season, Cross Bar SRMA started allowing archery-only drawn hunts through the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.\nAlthough Cross Bar has been — and remains — open to visitors, the trouble is getting there. The land is essentially an island — surrounded on all sides by private land with no public road to access the property. For years, the only way to see Cross Bar was to call the BLM’s field office in Amarillo, get a permit and then make the tough 1.5-mile trek up the Canadian River.\nSince her first visit, Van Ongevalle has grown passionate about this golden slice of prairie. Now, as executive director of the Friends of Cross Bar SRMA, a nonprofit she founded in 2022, she’s working to increase access for others.\nLots has changed since her move. Amarillo has grown — it’s now a sprawling urban area surpassing 200,000 people. Van Ongevalle has also come to love the golden grasslands and wide-open places where she can roam free.\n“Amarillo needs things like this,” she says. “Ninety-seven percent of Texas is privately owned, so to be able to open up public land is pretty important.”\nTexas’ Private Past\nWith a large presence in Arizona, California, Colorado and other western states, the Bureau of Land Management oversees properties that provide abundant access to hunting, hiking, camping and a long list of other recreational activities. The agency administers nearly 250 million acres of land, or one-eighth of the U.S. total landmass. In fact, it is the largest landholder in the country - overseeing more acres than even the National Park Service.\nSo, why, then, is there only one tract of BLM land in Texas?\nAfter the helium craze died down, wells were plugged and public access was allowed on the property beginning in the 1990s.\nExpanding Access\nCross Bar SRMA occupies nearly 12,000 acres of tallgrass prairie just west of U.S. Highway 87 and nestled on the southern shores of the Canadian River.\nThrough Friends of the Cross Bar SRMA, Van Ongevalle organizes occasional “open trails” days in which she coordinates access to Cross Bar via shared easement roads with adjacent property owners.\nCurrently, the organization is working to build a road that will facilitate access. The road, which is set for completion in 2028, will allow access from Highway 87 and enable visitors to drive from downtown Amarillo to the park entrance in only 20 minutes.\nWhile construction of the road is underway, the nonprofit is working to build out park infrastructure. By the end of last year, about 16 miles of trail were completed. By the time the road is complete, Van Ongevalle expects there will be 22 completed miles of trail for hikers, bikers and horseback riders. Ultimately, the organization aims to construct a 40-mile trail network and more than 100 campsites within the SRMA.\nCurrently, the organization is working to build a road that will facilitate access.
