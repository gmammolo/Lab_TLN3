  "text": "Google partners with Mombak to finance Amazon rainforest restoration, aiming to offset 200,000 tons of carbon emissions. This move reflects big tech's shift towards sustainable ventures amidst growing energy demands. Mombak offers credible carbon credits aligned with the Symbiosis Coalition's rigorous standards, driving demand for quality offsets. Google has sealed a major deal with Brazilian startup Mombak to finance the restoration of the Amazon rainforest, marking the tech giant's largest venture into carbon removal. This partnership is part of the tech industry's broader efforts to acquire high-quality carbon credits and mitigate emissions from energy-intensive data centers. The agreement aims to offset 200,000 metric tons of carbon emissions, significantly surpassing past initiatives. Although the financial details remain undisclosed, the collaboration emphasizes Google's commitment to addressing environmental impacts, particularly as data centers expand with advancements in AI technology. Notably, Google has invested over $100 million in various carbon capture methods. Avoiding controversial REDD credits, Google prefers Mombak's approach that revitalizes degraded pastures into forests. This initiative aligns with the Symbiosis Coalition's standards, ensuring transparency and ecological benefits. As demand for such credible offsets rises, so do prices, highlighting the market's shift towards sustainable development in the reforestation sector. (With inputs from agencies.)",
