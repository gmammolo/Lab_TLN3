  "text": "TUCSON, Ariz. — The Sonoran Desert glows gold under the first light of dawn, and the saguaro silhouettes stretch against a cloudless sky. Arizona’s fall sunshine continues to dominate, keeping Tucson warm, dry, and brilliantly clear through the weekend.\nThe National Weather Service in Tucson expects a quiet stretch of late-fall weather — one more round of unseasonable warmth before cooler air begins to nudge southward next week. Highs will reach the mid-to-upper 80s through Sunday, near 10 degrees above average for early November. Calm winds and abundant sunshine make this one of the best weekends of the month for travel, outdoor work, or early holiday shopping around town.\nThursday’s high of 86°F marks the peak of this warm spell. Friday and Saturday remain just as steady, hovering near 85°F with light north-northwest breezes during the afternoons. Mornings stay comfortably mild in the 50s, with clear, dry air keeping visibility perfect for travelers along I-10 between Tucson and Phoenix.\nBy Sunday night, subtle hints of a transition emerge. High pressure weakens, allowing slightly cooler air to drift across southern Arizona by Monday and Tuesday. Highs drop into the low 80s with a few high clouds returning — the first early sign of a late-fall pattern shift that could usher in cooler, breezier conditions closer to mid-November.\nFor now, Tucson remains locked in near-perfect weather. It’s ideal for stargazing, hiking the Catalina foothills, or tackling early yard prep before winter chill eventually finds its way into the desert.\nFive-Day Outlook for Tucson, AZ:\nThu: 86/54 – Sunny; light south breeze.\nFri: 85/54 – Clear and calm; warm.\nSat: 85/56 – Sunny; steady pattern continues.\nSun: 86/56 – Bright and warm; slight cool-down ahead.\nMon: 82/57 – Mostly clear; light winds.",
