  "text": "NAOGAON, Nov 6, 2025 (BSS) - In a significant act of wildlife conservation, six cotton pygmy-goose (Bali-hash), which had been illegally detained for sale, were rescued and released into the wild in Porsha upazila of the district on Wednesday.\nThe successful operation was carried out by the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Rakibul Islam, who is receiving widespread praise for his commitment to public welfare and environmental protection.\nOn Wednesday morning, some guest birds were detained at the house of Nazrul at Gopinathpur village of Nitpur union of the upazila for sale.\nBeing informed, a rescue operation was swiftly launched, leading to the liberation of the six birds. The birds were then released on the banks of the Nitpur Purnabhaba River, their natural habitat.\nUNO Rakibul Islam speaking on the matter, he questioned, \"Does anyone kill guests who come to someone's house? Cook them and eat them? Then why should all kinds of guest birds that come to our area be illegally detained and cooked and eaten?\"\nHe further emphasized that, under the Wildlife Conservation and Safety Act of 2012, it is a punishable offense to capture, kill, sell, or consume migratory birds. Violators can face imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to one lakh taka.\nThe rescue operation is part of a broader initiative led by Rakibul Islam to promote social welfare and environmental awareness in the region.\nUNO Rakibul Islam warned that anyone found engaging in similar illegal activities in the future will face imprisonment, reinforcing the commitment to uphold the law and protect wildlife in the region.\nThis initiative highlights the growing awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and the need to protect migratory species that play a critical role in the ecosystem.",
