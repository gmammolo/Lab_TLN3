  "text": "Mayo County Council has welcomed the good results achieved by both Balla and Castlebar in this year’s Tidy Towns competition.\nIn a report to members of Castlebar Municipal District, council management noted that Balla won the national Tree Project Award for its exceptional Woodland Park Project, funded under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme 2022.\n\"This initiative has significantly enhanced local biodiversity and community engagement. In addition, Balla was awarded a Bronze Medal, marking continued progress.\n\"Castlebar also achieved remarkable success, earning a Gold Medal and the prestigious County Commended Award for Mayo. The town was also singled out nationally as a model of inclusion, with over 30 nationalities actively participating in the Tidy Towns group. This year, Castlebar recorded its highest-ever score, increasing by 19 points compared to 2024 – a testament to the group’s hard work, innovation, and inclusive approach.”",
