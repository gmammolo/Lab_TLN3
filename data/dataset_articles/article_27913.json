  "text": "Eco-friendly viewing platform opens to the public\nA park has installed a viewing platform made from recycled plastic to give visitors better access to its pond life.\nThe environmentally friendly structure at Queen's Park in Bournemouth has a wood-like effect and was opened to the public on Monday.\nQueen's Park and Charminster Neighbourhood Forum submit a successful bid to Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council for the work.\nThe local authority allocated community infrastructure levy funding to get the project off the ground.\nCouncillor Alasdair Keddie, ward councillor for Queen's Park, said it was a great example of collaboration between the council and the local community.\n\"The new platform not only enhances the visitor experience but also reflects our commitment to sustainability and improving access to green spaces,\" he said.\nThe pond provides a rich habitat for birds such as the little egret, heron, mallard ducks, and breeding moorhens.\nIt is also a home to dragonflies and many smaller creatures that are essential to the wildlife food chain.\nCouncillor Andy Hadley, portfolio holder for environment said: \"By enhancing the pond's biodiversity, the space becomes even more attractive for outdoor recreation and community engagement - strengthening the bond between people and their local green spaces.\n\"Within our Nature Towns project, we are aiming to connect our green spaces for people and nature and this work is an important stepping stone.\"",
