  "text": "Olney Friends School USDA Farm Students\nBarnesville, Ohio - November 05, 2025 - At Olney Friends School, the classroom extends far beyond four walls. The school's 350-acre working farm has officially earned USDA Organic certification for both crops and livestock-formal recognition of what Olney has practiced since its founding in 1837: teaching young people responsibility, purpose, and connection through meaningful, hands-on work.\n\"Students participate directly in planting, harvesting, and caring for livestock,\" says Farm Manager Don Guindon. \"They're not just learning about agriculture-they're developing life skills and self-reliance you can't get from a textbook.\"\nEvery student at Olney takes part in the rhythms of the farm. Whether collecting eggs before class or tending to vegetables for the dining hall, farm life is deeply woven into the school's daily curriculum. The result is a living laboratory where lessons in sustainability, community, and integrity come naturally.\nWho This School Serves\nFor Head of School Christian Acemah, an Olney graduate (Class of 2001), the connection families feel when they visit is immediate.\n\"Families know instinctively that their children can be themselves at Olney-they'll find a sense of belonging here,\" Acemah explains. \"Most visiting students realize it halfway through their interview and say, 'Yes, this is where I want to be.'\"\nThat sense of belonging attracts students from across the U.S. and around the world, including:\n-Non-conformists who felt invisible in larger schools\n-International students seeking genuine community\n-LGBTQ+ youth looking for acceptance\n-Hands-on learners who thrive by doing, not by sitting in rows\nWhat Makes Olney Different\nA small Quaker boarding school for grades 9-12, Olney Friends School offers a globally diverse community and an impressive 3:1 student-teacher ratio. The farm isn't a club or elective-it's part of daily life. Students learn environmental stewardship, cooperation, and leadership in real time, through real work.\nRooted in Quaker values of equality, peace, integrity, and community, Olney provides an alternative to high-pressure, competition-driven education. Its newly certified organic farm meets rigorous national standards-but more importantly, it symbolizes a school culture where students learn to care for something larger than themselves.\n-Hands-on learners who thrive by doing\nContact Us:\n-Olney Friends School\n-61830 Sandy Ridge Rd, Barnesville, OH 43713, United States\n- https://www.olneyfriends.org/\nLearn More\nLocated in Barnesville, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border, Olney Friends School offers an alternative to high-pressure, competitive academics-grounded in Quaker values of equality, peace, integrity, and community.\nTo schedule a visit or learn about admissions, go to www.olneyfriends.org/admissions or call 740-425-3655.\nThis release was published on openPR.",
