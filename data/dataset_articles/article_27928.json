  "text": "LAHORE, Nov 06 (APP):The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) Lahore has launched a mission to make the city greener and more vibrant and 45,000 bamboo plants are being planted along various drains across the city, including Gajjumatta to Bedian Road, Hadiara Drain, Lala Zar, and Thokar Niaz Baig. According to a spokesperson of the authority, over 10,000 bamboo saplings have already been planted. Director General Parks and Horticulture Authority Lahore Raja Mansoor Ahmad stated that bamboo is a fast-growing plant, and its plantation along the city drains will not only help eliminate unpleasant sights and odors but will also contribute significantly to reducing air pollution and smog. The DG added that PHA teams are planting saplings daily along the drains from Gajjumatta to Bedian Road, as well as in Lalazar Park and Thokar Niaz Baig. Raja Mansoor Ahmad noted that more than 50 gardeners and PHA staff members are actively participating in this plantation drive, while directors and officers of the respective zones are supervising the campaign.",
