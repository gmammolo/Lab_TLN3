ANTARA/Harianto Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia’s shrimp exports continue to climb despite earlier concerns over Cesium-137 radioactive contamination, reflecting renewed global confidence in the safety and quality of the country’s fishery products, the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries said Thursday.\nFrom January to September 2025, Indonesia’s fishery exports totaled $4.52 billion, with shrimp remaining the top export commodity at $1.397 billion, said Catur Sarwanto, director of business empowerment at the ministry’s Directorate General for Strengthening Marine and Fishery Product Competitiveness.\n“If we look at the data, our shrimp exports are still increasing,” Sarwanto told reporters in Jakarta.\nThe United States remains Indonesia’s primary shrimp export market, accounting for 63.1 percent of total shipments. Exports to the US rose 16.3 percent year-on-year from January to September, while September shipments climbed 16.6 percent compared with August.\n“Shrimp exports have continued to rise through September. This shows that despite the recent situation, we have recovered quickly, as evidenced by the export growth through the third quarter,” Sarwanto said.\nThe top five destinations for Indonesia’s fishery exports between January and September 2025 were the United States ($1.495 billion), China ($812.76 million), ASEAN ($711.99 million), Japan ($448.29 million), and the European Union ($331.32 million).\nIndonesia also resumed shrimp exports to the United States worth 20.4 billion rupiah ($1.2 million) following the Cesium-137 incident, signaling the restoration of international trust in the country’s compliance with global safety standards.\nThe shipments were conducted in stages — two containers on Oct. 31, two on Nov. 1, two on Nov. 3, and one on Nov. 4, 2025 — after clearance procedures confirmed the products were free of radioactive contamination.\nRelated news: Indonesia regains US trust as shrimp exports resume\nRelated news: Cesium-137 contamination cleared at 20 Cikande plants: authorities\nTranslator: Muhammad Harianto, Kuntum Khaira Riswan\nEditor: Rahmad Nasution\nCopyright © ANTARA 2025",
