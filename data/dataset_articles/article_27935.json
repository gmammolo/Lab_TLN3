  "text": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has helped seven countries secure $5.8 million in financing from the Kunming Biodiversity Fund (KBF) to integrate biodiversity into agrifood systems and drive action under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF).\nThe selected projects support multiple KMGBF targets on sustainable agriculture, ecosystem protection, knowledge management, the control of invasive species and the engagement of local communities – including Indigenous Peoples – in biodiversity management for food and agriculture.\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu welcomed the announcement, saying: “The Kunming Biodiversity Fund is instrumental in helping developing countries achieve global biodiversity goals through sustainable agriculture under the overarching guidance of the Four Betters, and in amplifying the central role of agrifood systems in halting biodiversity loss, promoting food diversity and providing solutions to the climate crisis.”\nLaunched by the People’s Republic of China in 2021 during the first part of the UN Biodiversity Conference under China’s Presidency, the KBF supports developing countries for biodiversity protection and in meeting the KMGBF’s global goals, with a focus on regions rich in biodiversity but in need of stronger capacity and resources.\nThe funding will target the following projects:\n1. Mainstreaming biodiversity into agrifood systems to implement National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs)\nThis project aims to mainstream biodiversity into agrifood systems by creating enabling conditions that accelerate the implementation of NBSAPs in Madagascar, Uganda, and Mexico. It will enhance policy alignment, strengthen institutional capacity, improve financial incentives for biodiversity-friendly practices, and promote knowledge sharing.\n2. Empowering communities through knowledge management of ecosystems and species to achieve the KMGBF in the Cook Islands\nBy improving knowledge systems, modernizing data, and promoting sustainable practices, the project will empower communities to conserve, restore, and manage biodiversity. It will establish a national ecosystem classification, revitalize the biodiversity database, and support community-led conservation using traditional knowledge and agroecology, with a focus on women and youth.\n3. Effective management of invasive alien species for ecosystem benefits in Nepal\nBy focusing on halting the spread and managing existing populations of invasive alien species, the project aims to reduce their impact on biodiversity and local livelihoods through community-based action, participatory approaches, and stronger institutional capacity.\n4. Prevention and control of invasive alien species for enhanced biosecurity in Sri Lanka\nThis project will strengthen national capacity to prevent and manage invasive alien species by improving border controls, training frontline teams, and involving communities in removal efforts and awareness campaigns.\n5. Strengthening ecosystem resilience and sustainable management of Lake Eğirdir in Türkiye\nThe project will raise public awareness and promote biodiversity-friendly practices to protect the lake and its ecosystems. It will also support water-efficient agriculture and encourage sustainable livelihoods in the region.\nThe role of agrifood systems in implementing the KMGBF\nAgrifood systems are directly linked to more than half of the KMGBF’s targets. FAO plays a key role in their implementation by fostering policy coherence, promoting best practices, and scaling up innovations to accelerate progress towards global biodiversity goals.\nFAO is committed to transforming agrifood systems into drivers of sustainable development. This transformation is central to reversing biodiversity loss while ensuring food security, improved nutrition and resilient livelihoods for all.\nThe selected projects support multiple KMGBF targets on sustainable agriculture, ecosystem protection, knowledge management, the control of invasive species and the engagement of local communities – including Indigenous Peoples – in biodiversity management for food and agriculture.\nFAO Director-General QU Dongyu welcomed the announcement, saying: “The Kunming Biodiversity Fund is instrumental in helping developing countries achieve global biodiversity goals through sustainable agriculture under the overarching guidance of the Four Betters, and in amplifying the central role of agrifood systems in halting biodiversity loss, promoting food diversity and providing solutions to the climate crisis.”\nLaunched by the People’s Republic of China in 2021 during the first part of the UN Biodiversity Conference under China’s Presidency, the KBF supports developing countries for biodiversity protection and in meeting the KMGBF’s global goals, with a focus on regions rich in biodiversity but in need of stronger capacity and resources.\nThe funding will target the following projects:\n1.
