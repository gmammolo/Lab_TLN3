  "text": "Hanoi (VNA) - The Green Economy Forum (GEF) 2025 is scheduled to take place in Hanoi on November 27under the theme “Shaping Changes, Building Futures.”\nHosted by the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (EuroCham), the event aims to translate climate ambitions into practical solutions by bringing together policymakers, business leaders, and innovators from Vietnam and Europe.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Hanoi on November 6 to announce the event, EuroCham Chairman Bruno Jaspaert said European investment targets sectors that genuinely drive sustainable development - those that matter not only for today’s growth but for generations to come.\nHe added that frameworks such as the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) and the Global Gateway are further aligning environmental and economic goals between Vietnam and the EU.\nEU Ambassador to Vietnam Julien Guerrier noted that in times of global uncertainty, such partnerships between Vietnam and the EU matter more than ever.\nHe expressed his confidence that the Vietnam-EU cooperation will continue to deepen and bring tangible benefits to their businesses and people.\nAs Vietnam works toward its 2050 net-zero target, the Ambassador told the Vietnam News Agency that two key efforts are essential.\nFirst, it is essential to establish an appropriate regulatory framework to attract private investment for its green transition and renewable energy expansion.\nSecond, the Southeast Asian country needs adequate energy infrastructure, especially a modernised power grid capable of absorbing new renewable capacity, he added.\nGEF 2025 will feature nine high-level sessions on Vietnam’s sustainability priorities, three practical workshops run by European business associations, a keynote speech by a global green-economy expert, and a networking event aimed at fostering long-term partnerships./.",
