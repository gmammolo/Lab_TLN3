  "text": "Baker Hughes wins NOIA ESG Excellence Award for advancing offshore sustainability\nThe National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) has awarded Baker Hughes the 2025 ESG Excellence Award, recognizing the company’s leadership in advancing sustainability, operational efficiency, and responsible energy development across the offshore oil and gas sector.\nThe NOIA ESG Excellence Award highlights companies that demonstrate outstanding performance in environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and governance. Baker Hughes was honored for its data-driven approach to reducing emissions, expanding remote operations, and integrating sustainability across its global offshore operations.\n“Baker Hughes exemplifies the offshore industry’s broader commitment to innovation, environmental performance, and community engagement,” said Erik Milito, President of NOIA. “Their holistic approach sets a high standard for the sector, showing how offshore energy continues to innovate and deliver meaningful societal benefits.”\nChris Johnson, Vice President for North America Offshore at Baker Hughes, said the award reflects the company’s mission to make energy “safer, cleaner, and more efficient.” Since 2019, Baker Hughes has cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by nearly 30% and expanded its ability to support customers remotely -- reducing carbon output by approximately six tons of CO₂ annually for every engineer shifted from offshore travel to remote service.\nThe independent judging panel, which included representatives from Pickering Energy Partners, Cornerstone Government Affairs, and FTI Consulting, commended Baker Hughes for measurable achievements across all ESG dimensions. The company joins past NOIA ESG award winners SEACOR Marine, TechnipFMC, and Vallourec.\nBaker Hughes will present additional details about its ESG initiatives and offshore performance at the 2026 NOIA Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C.",
