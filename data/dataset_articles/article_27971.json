  "text": "14 minutes ago On November 5, 2025, the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust’s Board of Trustees approved more than $139 million in new low-interest loans and grants. The funding will support water infrastructure projects across Massachusetts. The total amount approved is $139,004,264.\nThis money will help cities, towns, and water utilities improve water resources, provide safe drinking water, and protect public health.\nThe Trust partners with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through the State Revolving Funds (SRFs) program. Since 1989, the Clean Water Trust has provided almost $9.6 billion in financial assistance. These funds have benefited about 97 percent of Massachusetts residents.\nThe SRF programs act as an environmental infrastructure bank, financing water projects across the state. More information about loan programs and applications is available on the Trust’s and MassDEP’s official websites.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
