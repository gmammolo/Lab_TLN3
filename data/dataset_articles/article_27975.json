  "text": "Blechnum orientale Photo: Courtesy of the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences\nChinese scientists have, for the first time, discovered rare-earth biomineralization in ferns, a finding that could enable a more sustainable supply of rare-earth elements, address environmental challenges in traditional mining and offer a cleaner alternative for their extraction, chinanews.com reported on Thursday.\nRare-earth elements, known as the “vitamins of industry,” are indispensable strategic resources for high-tech fields such as artificial intelligence, new energy and national defense, yet their supply faces environmental and geopolitical challenges.\nThe team led by Zhu Jianxi, a researcher at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, reported a breakthrough in obtaining the key raw materials through phytomining, a green strategy that uses hyperaccumulator plants to extract metals from soil, the Global Times learned on Thursday.\nThe team found that the edible fern species Blechnum orientale contains high concentration of rare-earth elements, and observed these elements crystallizing within extracellular tissues under ambient conditions, forming dendritic, nanoscale monazite through mineralization coupled with self-organization.\nThis is the first discovery of biological mineralization phenomenon of rare-earth elements in natural plants. Such minerals are typically formed through geological processes such as magmatic or hydrothermal activity, that require higher temperatures.\nThe findings, published in the international journal Environmental Science & Technology online on Wednesday not only reveal the mechanisms by which plants “detoxify” and mineralize rare-earth elements but also provide a new pathway for the sustainable use of rare-earth resources.\nBy cultivating hyperaccumulator plants such as Blechnum orientale, it is possible to both remediate contaminated soil and restore rare-earth mine tailings while simultaneously recovering high-value rare-earth elements from biomass – achieving a truly green circular model of “restoration alongside recovery,” researchers said.\n“In the past, we only knew that microorganisms and animals could ‘produce minerals’ in their bodies, such as calcite and aragonite in shells and corals, and apatite in animals’ teeth and bones. However, the ‘mineral-producing ability’ of plants has long been underestimated,” He Liuqing, first author of the research paper, told the Global Times on Thursday.\n“The discovery of rare-earth biomineralization in Blechnum orientale not only expands human’s understanding of biomineralization mechanisms in plants but also opens a new window for studying nearly a thousand known hyperaccumulator plants,” said Zhu.\nBlechnum orientale is a special type of rare-earth “hyperaccumulator” – essentially acting as a “rare-earth vacuum cleaner” in the soil. It efficiently absorbs rare-earth elements dispersed in the environment, and concentrates them in the vascular bundles and epidermal tissues of its leaves. The rare-earth elements precipitate in the form of nanoparticles and further crystallize into rare-earth minerals.\nThis self-protection mechanism helps lock potentially harmful rare-earth ions into mineral structures, neutralizing and naturally “detoxifying” them.\nMonazite is an important industrial source of rare-earth elements. However, its natural form often contains radioactive uranium and thorium, which complicates both its mining and practical application. By contrast, the “biological monazite” formed by Blechnum orientale under natural growth conditions is pure and non-radioactive, showing strong potential for green extraction.",
