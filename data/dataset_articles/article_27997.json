  "text": "AUTUMN is the perfect time to visit central Spain’s chestnut forest which is the home of century old trees.\nDuring autumn Castañar de El Tiemblo’s trees turn beautiful shades of yellow, red, and orange, making it the perfect season to witness the forest filled with wildlife.\nLocated 90km from Madrid, the forest offers a circular walking route which allows visitors to tour its main attractions.\nREAD MORE: This medieval town in western Spain is one of the few to still boast a Jewish quarter\nIt begins with young chestnut trees and then passes Los Cazeruelos, a fountain, and the Refugio de la Majalavilla, a refuge within the trees.\nFrom there the forest opens up and lures you in.\nIts main attraction is ‘El Abuelo’, an over 500 year old chestnut tree that stands at an enormous 19 metres tall.\nThis ancient tree forms part of the Catalogo de Especimenes Vegetales de Singular Relevancia de Castilla y Leon (Catalogue of Plant Specimens of Singular Relevance in Castilla y Leon).\nThe path then leads visitors to walk parallel to the stream, Garganta de Yedra, where there are numerous alder trees.\nREAD MORE: This ‘most underrated Spanish city’ boasts iconic 12th century houses perched atop a cliff face overlooking a river\nFrom there, guests arrive at the home of various long life specimens – one of these, named Castaño del Codao, has a central dry trunk that has green shoots emerging from it in the shape of a crown, acting as a metaphor for the triumph of life over death.\nWith wild boars, foxes, and squirrels, this forest puts a spotlight on nature’s beauty.\nTo visit from the nation’s capital, one can drive on the M-501 and then along a forest road to the El Regajo Recreation Area.\nHere is a car park which charges 6 per vehicle during the period between October 12 and December 25.\nEntry to the forest costs €2 per person with private buses paying €60 – if you arrive by foot or bike entry is free, as is coming by local bus with a ticket on that municipal transport costing €4 per person.",
