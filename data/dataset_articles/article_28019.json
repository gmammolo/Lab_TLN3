  "text": "The American Nuclear Society (ANS) President Steven Arndt and ANS CEO and Executive Director Craig Piercy issued the following statement on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022:\n“On behalf of the American nuclear community, we applaud the U.S. Senate for including nuclear-specific clean energy provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (H.R. 5376).\nIf enacted, these provisions will boost production of zero-carbon nuclear energy in the U.S. through the preservation of our existing nuclear fleet, and the scale-up of new and advanced reactors.\nMore broadly, these provisions will accelerate the transition to a ‘net-zero’ power grid without jeopardizing our energy independence or resilience.\nA robust U.S. nuclear energy program also creates tens of thousands of American jobs. U.S. nuclear plants pay workers 20 percent more than other energy facilities, employ more workers per megawatt, and provide robust, stable tax bases for local communities.\nSimply put, nuclear energy is an indispensable part of our collective national security and economic prosperity. We thank Congress for the prompt consideration of these provisions.”",
