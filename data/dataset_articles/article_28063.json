  "text": "Audio By Carbonatix\nGhana’s Minister for Energy and Green Transition, John Abdulai Jinapor, has announced that the country is positioning itself as a continental leader in clean energy, backed by an ambitious US$3.4 billion renewable energy action and investment plan.\nSpeaking at the 3rd Renewable Energy Forum Africa (REFA 2025) in Accra on Wednesday, the Minister said the plan will guide Ghana’s energy transformation over the next five years, with a strong emphasis on private-sector participation.\n“We have taken bold and decisive actions to develop our renewable energy sector for economic prosperity,” he said.\n“The US$3.4 billion plan focuses on installing 1,400MW of renewable capacity, deploying 400 mini-grids, promoting over 100 fast-charging stations, and accelerating solar water pumping to boost agriculture.”\nMr Jinapor noted that Ghana is already recording significant progress.\n“Ghana today has the largest single rooftop solar installation of 16.8MW in Africa,” he stated, adding that President John Dramani Mahama recently cut the sod for a 200MW solar plant, which will expand to 1,000MW by 2032.\nHe stressed that Africa cannot afford to squander its natural advantage in renewable resources.\n“A continent blessed with 60% of the world’s solar potential is shackled by energy poverty. This is unacceptable,” he said.\nThe Minister urged African governments, industry leaders and investors to drive a coordinated transformation.\n“If we work together to harness just 20% of our renewable energy resources, we stand the chance to eradicate energy poverty and fuel sustainable development for all.”",
