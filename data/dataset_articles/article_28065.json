  "text": "A delegation from Guyana which participated in the inaugural EU–Guyana Global Gateway Study and Investment Mission has returned home after a week of “high-level” engagements across France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain.\nThe mission explored European models in port operations, maritime governance, agro-innovation, and cold-chain logistics areas that have become increasingly important to Guyana’s development trajectory as the country expands its trade and logistics capacity, a statement from the Guyana Office for Investment (Go-Invest) said.\nThe delegation engaged in intensive sessions on port operations, including detailed examinations of the systems in place at Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam, Fos-Marseille, Málaga, and Algeciras, where delegates observed advanced digitalisation platforms such as Port Community Systems (PCS), as well as green transition policies, integrated cruise-cargo management, and cold chain logistics.",
