  "text": "Nairobi, 4 December 2025 The UN today recognized three new World Restoration Flagships in Australia, Canada and South Africa, anchored in Indigenous Peoples and local knowledge. Announced ahead of the seventh session of the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA-7), the new initiatives support agrifood systems, biodiversity and climate goals.\nJointly led by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the awards are announced under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (20212030). The World Restoration Flagships represent some of the most ambitious, science-based, and inclusive examples of restoration in action.\nOne hectare at a time, governments, communities and partners are restoring forests, grasslands, shrublands, coastlines and marine environments, said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. By combining lessons from Indigenous Peoples with modern science, we are restoring damaged ecosystems. One hectare at a time.\nReal ecosystem restoration is accomplished from the ground up, said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. With Indigenous Peoples and local communities at the center, these new Flagships demonstrate the power of partnerships that bridge ancient wisdom with modern innovation, while strengthening agrifood systems, biodiversity and food diversity, and climate resilience.\nShellfish Reef Building Program Australia\nAustralias once-abundant shellfish reefs comprising oysters and mussels have become critically endangered by overharvesting, sedimentation and pollution, among others. Between 2021and 2023, The Nature Conservancy and the Australian Government embarked on the Reef Builder programme to rebuild these vital coastal ecosystems at 13 locations around the southern coastline, in partnership with local communities. The Nature Conservancy continues this partnership-based work to restore native shellfish reefs across 30 percent of their original locations around Australias expansive coast by 2030.\nShellfish reefs are natural solutions to some of our greatest conservation challenges, and Reef Builder has shown that restoring them at a national scale is not only possibleits transformative, said Australias Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator the Hon. Murray Watt. This recognition as a UN World Restoration Flagship highlights Australias leadership in marine ecosystem recovery. Reef Builder is delivering real benefits for nature and communities alike; supporting local jobs, strengthening coastal resilience, and revitalising biodiversity along our shorelines.\nShellfish reefs serve as natural ecosystem engineers, purifying water and providing habitat for hundreds of marine species. Since the initiatives launch, it has helped remove nearly 15 tonnes of nutrient pollution, boost fish stocks, and has achieved significant biodiversity gains. The restoration project has generated over 425 jobs and USD 10 million by supporting over 50 small and medium sized businesses, which helps to reconnect coastal communities with nature and promote stewardship of the marine environment. This project involves the deep collaboration of many different groups, including Indigenous Traditional owners, fishers, restaurants, scientists and local communities.\nRespectful Returns: Restoring Resilience to Salmon Ecosystems Canada\nMany salmon populations are in peril in Canada, with significant economic and cultural consequences salmon hold profound spiritual value in the country, particularly for Indigenous communities. Since 2010, Parks Canada has collaborated with Indigenous Peoples and local communities on the Respectful Returns initiative, which focuses on restoring damaged rivers and streams in seven national parks along Canadas Pacific and Atlantic coasts.\nCanada is honoured that Parks Canadas salmon restoration initiative has been named a World Restoration Flagship by the United Nations Environment Programme. This global recognition shows whats possible when we act boldly and work together, said the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of the Environment, Climate Change and Nature. Guided by Indigenous knowledge and science, Respectful Returns demonstrates the power of collaboration to restore ecosystems and renew relationships with Indigenous communities whose cultures and livelihoods are tied to salmon. More than a project, it is a blueprint for restoration worldwide where reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples through shared stewardship and conservation go hand in hand to protect biodiversity and strengthen communities.\nBy using new tools, sharing knowledge, and working together, the project has helped restore over 65,000 hectares of land and 228 kilometers of waterways. Respectful Returns has also created more than 100 jobs, supported research at three universities, and built strong partnerships with 32 organizations and communities. The goal is to protect salmon and their habitats while strengthening the connection between people and nature. This work is helping both the environment and communities heal and grow together. In six out of the seven sites, salmon numbers have already increased.\nThicket Restoration Movement South Africa\nOne of South Africas most biodiverse yet neglected ecosystems is the native subtropical thicket. Thicket Restoration in South Africa unites over 60 initiatives across Eastern and Western Cape. The initiative aims to restore 800,000 ha by 2030.\nRestoring thicket makes the soil more resilient, stores carbon and serves as fodder storage for large livestock and other large mammals during droughts, a high priority for a region that has experienced its worst drought in 100 years in 2023/24. It also provides a safe habitat for various native browser species, including black rhinos and African elephants, responding to long-term threats. Planting native species, clearing invasive plants and training communities in restoration is expected to create more than 1,000 rural jobs, improving the livelihoods of around two million people. The thickets revival also sequesters up to eight million tonnes of CO annually, offsetting emissions equivalent to about 20 gas-fired power plants.\nThe efforts that have been put into spekboom restoration will benefit future generations. We are banking for the long term, said Luyanda Luthuli, a landscape practitioner of Living Lands, one of the organizations forming the initiative. I am excited and hopeful for the future and for seeing the fruits of our labor towards restoring ecosystems, restoring resilience.\nRestoring ecosystems restoring resilience\nThese three new World Restoration Flagships add to a growing portfolio of already 27 recognized flagships, collectively restoring over 18 million ha of diverse ecosystems worldwide, with plans to restore a total of more than 68 million ha.\nThe success of multiple ecosystem restoration initiatives highlights a central message of UNEA-7: restoring ecosystems is an essential pathway to strengthen resilience for people and nature, ensuring they thrive in tandem.\nhere.",
