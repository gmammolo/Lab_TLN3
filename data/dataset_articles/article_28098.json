  "text": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the deployment of 4,000 telecommunications towers in underserved rural communities across Nigeria.\nMinister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the FEC meeting presided over by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Wednesday.\nHe said the initiative is expected to enhance national security and stimulate economic activity in the affected areas.\nSpeaking on other issues discussed during the meeting, the minister noted that the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy presented the plan for the deployment of the towers in communities currently lacking adequate coverage.\n“Under this programme, about 4,000 towers will be erected in underserved communities,” he said.\nIdris highlighted that around 23 million Nigerians currently face communication challenges due to the absence of such infrastructure. “This initiative will not only help in tackling insecurity but also enhance commerce and economic activity among the people of these communities,” he added.\nHe said, “The presentation by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy indicates that about 23 million Nigerians are currently underserved, unable to access basic communication services due to the absence of these towers.”\nOn health and social welfare issues, the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Iziaq Salako, explained that the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTEF) provides sustained funding for the Basic Health Care Fund, enabling the revitalization of more primary health care centers.\nSalako noted that over 4,000 primary health centres have already been revitalised, with an additional 8,000 planned for the coming year.\n“The introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine has protected over 14 million Nigerian children against cervical cancer, and the combined rubella and measles vaccine has reached nearly 30 million children in less than a year. These programs can be scaled up further,” he said.\nHe added that the initiative reflects President Tinubu’s commitment to social welfare programs that directly impact the lives of ordinary Nigerians.",
