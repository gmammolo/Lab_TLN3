  "text": "When it comes to celebrating Latino values and food, Ла-Пальма Mexicatessan, a proud CleanPowerSF customer, knows how to do it! Since 1953, this hybrid of a grocery store, tortilla factory, and restaurant has been serving its community as the longest standing Latino owned business in the Mission. Calle 24 Latino Cultural District runs from Mission Street to Potrero Avenue and includes specialty stores, taquerias, Mexican bakeries, grocers and art galleries, as well as the greatest concentration of murals and Latino businesses in the City.\nAt La Palma, authenticity is at the heart of everything they do. “Build something that serves a purpose and gives back to the people around you,\" said Owner of La Palma, Aida Ibarra. \"Community is everything. And when your business reflects your values and your roots, people will support it—because they’ll feel the love you’ve put into it.”\nTheir menu celebrates Mexican tradition with dishes like mole, tamales, carnitas, burritos, chilaquiles, and enchiladas, all made with care and flavor. Their handmade corn and flour tortillas and high-quality masa have earned a devoted following, attracting customers from across the Bay Area who make the trip just to get a taste of the real thing. Stop by around the holidays, and you’ll see a line stretched out the door waiting to purchase tamales!\nOperating a Business with a Rich History\nFor the past decade, Aida and Ruben Ibarra have proudly served as the sole owners of La Palma, a business that has been part of their family for 44 years.\nToday, La Palma stands as more than just a local business; it’s a vibrant symbol of the Mission District’s community and cultural identity. The store continues to honor its roots by proudly employing Latino staff and celebrating the traditions that shaped it.\nAs Aida puts it, “This neighborhood has deep cultural roots, and it’s so important for our community to see people who look like them and speak like them owning businesses and creating opportunities.”\nContinuing the Heart of La Palma and Giving Back\nLa Palma has remained a constant for Aida Ibarra and her family. Aida fondly remembers her childhood visits, noting “My grandmother raised me, and as a little girl, I remember shopping at La Palma with her, it was part of our routine and part of our culture.” When La Palma was up for sale in 1981, Aida Ibarra’s family knew it was their calling to take on the business and continue to serve the communities of the Mission. And ever since, the Ibarra family has continued La Palma’s legacy: give back to the community, show up for the people, and set an example for others to follow.\nAida believes that leading by example is a powerful tool to showing the younger generations the true meaning of giving back to community through entrepreneurship. La Palma is now in a position to give back to their community with donations for schools, churches, and Latino heritage and culture events.\n\"We donate to schools, churches, and local events that celebrate and support our heritage. Whether it’s sponsoring a community festival or providing food for a school fundraiser, we try to show up for our people.\" Aida said.\nThe next time you are on 24th Street, stop by La Palma to get some of their masa and tortillas, and experience this deep connection to the Mission District.",
