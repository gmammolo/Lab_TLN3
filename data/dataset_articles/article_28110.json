  "text": "In 2025, it is planned to allocate 900 billion soums for projects aimed at protecting atmospheric air and improving the environmental situation in Uzbekistan. These funds will be used mainly for the modernization of filtration and air purification systems at industrial enterprises, as well as for the expansion of environmental programs and measures.\nAccording to the Minister of Economy and Finance of Uzbekistan, Jamshid Kuchkarov, these funds are of great importance for the health of the population and nature. According to Jusipbek Kazbekov, Deputy Head of the National Committee for Ecology and Climate Change, an additional 548 billion soums are expected to be allocated from the state budget in 2026.\nThe main goal of these projects is to reduce the negative impact of industrial emissions, reduce air pollution, and improve the quality of life of the population. In particular, the modernization of filtration systems has a positive impact on air quality and ensures the stability of the ecosystem.\nAlso, the measures taken to protect the environment serve to ensure healthy living conditions for the population, reduce environmental risks, and ensure sustainable development in the country.\nRead “Zamin” on Telegram!",
