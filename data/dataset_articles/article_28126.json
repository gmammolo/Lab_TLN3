  "text": "Green technology reduces pollution from diesel engines\nIn this context, DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) solution is considered an important step forward in reducing NOx (nitrogen oxide), the leading harmful agent in diesel emissions.\nAir pollution, especially in large cities such as Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, has become a serious challenge, directly affecting public health and sustainable development.\nMany studies have shown that emissions from vehicles account for a large proportion of total urban pollution. According to Associate Professor, Dr. Pham Huu Tuyen, Director of the Centre for Research on Propulsion Sources and Self-Propelled Vehicles (Ha Noi University of Science and Technology), currently, most vehicles in Viet Nam still use internal combustion engines, emitting many toxic gases such as NOx and fine dust PM.\nAlthough these substances account for less than 1% of the exhaust volume, due to the large number of vehicles, the actual emissions are very significant. In particular, diesel vehicles are the main source of NOx and PM emissions, directly affecting the environment and human health.\nIn fact, assessments by management agencies also show that air pollution is increasing. Hoang Hai, a representative of the Department of Environment under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, said that air pollution is mainly concentrated in Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City.\n| DEF - Phu My Xanh products are displayed at the National Achievement Exhibition. (Photo: TL). |\nPM2.5 concentrations often exceed standards, especially during the inversion season from October to March of the following year. The main causes come from transportation, construction activities, industrial production, waste burning and unfavourable meteorological factors.\nIn the face of increasingly serious air pollution, especially from diesel-powered vehicles, the application of green technology has become an urgent requirement. Notably, as environmental regulations become increasingly strict, the control and treatment of emissions, especially NOx, is not only a legal obligation but also an opportunity to apply advanced technology, towards a cleaner and more efficient transportation industry.\nAccording to Tran Vinh Loc, Deputy Director of the PVFCCo Research and Application Center under the PetroVietnam Fertilizer and Chemicals Corporation (PVFCCo-Phu My), the DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid) solution is an important step forward in the effort to reduce NOx emissions - one of the most harmful gases in diesel engine exhaust. DEF is a solution of 32.5% high purity urea and 67.5% deionized water with other active ingredients injected into the engine's selective catalytic converter (SCR) system, helping to convert up to 90% of NOx into nitrogen and water vapor.\nThis technology has been widely applied in countries with strict emission standards such as Europe, the US, Japan and China. The DEF - Phu My Xanh product, researched and manufactured by the PetroVietnam Fertilizer and Chemicals Corporation (PVFCCo - Phu My) according to international standards, is assessed by experts to contribute to reducing toxic gas emissions, promoting green transformation in the transportation sector, towards the goal of sustainable development and carbon neutrality in Viet Nam.\nAccording to Loc, the application of this technology not only significantly reduces toxic emissions, but also increases engine performance, saves fuel and prolongs equipment life. However, the quality of the solution plays a key role, so if a poor quality product is used, the SCR system can be damaged, causing the vehicle to fail to meet emission standards and causing great economic losses.\nTo meet that requirement, PVFCCo - Phu My has developed the DEF - Phu My Xanh product, produced from purified urea of Phu My Fertilizer Plant, ensuring high purity, extremely low heavy metal content, meeting international standards ISO 22241.\nIndependent testing results show that the impurity indicators are many times lower than the allowable limit, helping to protect the SCR catalyst system and maintain maximum processing efficiency. This unit has also cooperated strategically with Viet Nam Oil Corporation (PVOIL) to expand the distribution system, helping consumers to refill DEF at the same time as diesel fuel - a popular model in developed countries.\nAccording to the assessment, if emission standards are applied synchronously in Viet Nam by 2030, the demand for DEF in Viet Nam could reach 70-100 thousand tons/year. Currently, PVFCCo-Phu My is cooperating with the German Transport Association to certify and issue quality certificates for Phu My DEF products, thereby helping to boost exports to many demanding markets in the world.\nIn fact, the development of international standard diesel engine exhaust treatment solutions is a clear demonstration of the commitment of domestic chemical enterprises to “do business with environmental protection”. Phu My DEF products not only meet strict technical requirements but also demonstrate the spirit of corporate social responsibility: Enterprises proactively participate in reducing emissions, protecting the environment and the community.\nIt can be affirmed that emissions from diesel engines have a serious impact on the environment and human health. Although the technical effectiveness of the DEF solution has been proven, there are still many challenges to effectively deploy this solution in the emission control roadmap in Viet Nam.\nExperts also said that Viet Nam needs to soon standardise the quality of DEF solutions, tighten emission standards, eliminate unqualified vehicles from circulation, and develop the market for exhaust treatment solutions, aiming for a net zero emission target by 2050.\nAccording to Loc, the NOx exhaust treatment solution for diesel engines currently does not have Vietnamese standards and binding regulations on quality, so domestic manufacturers are mainly temporarily applying ISO 22241 standards. While this is an advanced fuel equipped on most modern diesel vehicles and equipment, aiming to reduce up to 90% of NOx emissions from engines, there are currently no regulations to strictly inspect and punish acts of disabling the SCR system or using substandard solutions. Therefore, tightening environmental inspection and applying sanctions with sufficient deterrence are necessary measures to ensure compliance with the law and protect the environment.\nExperts also believe that Viet Nam needs to soon standardise the quality of DEF solutions, tighten emission standards, eliminate unqualified vehicles from circulation, and develop the market for exhaust gas treatment solutions, aiming for a net zero emission target by 2050.\nPVN",
