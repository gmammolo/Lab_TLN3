  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – New Delhi\nNew Delhi, Dec 4: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reaffirmed India’s commitment to restoring its ecological heritage through Project Cheetah, calling it a landmark initiative in wildlife conservation.\nExtending greetings on International Cheetah Day, the Prime Minister said the project aims not only at reviving the species in India but also at rejuvenating the ecosystem in which the wild cat can prosper.\n“Three years ago, our Government launched Project Cheetah with the aim of safeguarding this magnificent animal and restoring the ecosystem in which it can truly flourish. It was also an effort to revive lost ecological heritage and strengthen our biodiversity,” PM Modi said in a post on X.\nThe Prime Minister noted that India is proud to host several cheetahs, including a significant number of India-born cubs now thriving in Kuno National Park and Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh.\n“It is heartening to see cheetah tourism growing in popularity as well. I encourage more wildlife enthusiasts from across the world to visit India and witness the cheetah in all its splendour,” he added.\nModi credited the remarkable progress to the collective efforts of conservation teams and the support of local communities, particularly the Cheetah Mitras. “Protecting wildlife and living in harmony with nature are integral to India’s civilisational ethos,” he said.\nGrowing Cheetah Population in India\nOfficials said India’s mission to reintroduce cheetahs into their natural habitats has entered an encouraging phase, overcoming earlier skepticism.\nA total of 20 cheetahs were translocated to India — eight from Namibia in September 2022 and 12 from South Africa in February 2023.\nAs of December 2025, India records a thriving population of 32 cheetahs, including 21 India-born cubs. A recent milestone saw Mukhi, an India-born female, give birth to five healthy cubs in November 2025 — a significant boost for the project.\nAuthorities say growing habitat areas, intensive monitoring, and international partnerships continue to drive the ambitious conservation mission forward.",
