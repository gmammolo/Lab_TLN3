  "text": "Shanghai, China, November 27 –On November 27, 2025, the 2026 Bloomberg Green Watchlist launch ceremony was successfully held in Shanghai by Bloomberg Businessweek. LONGi was successfully included in the \"Leading ESG Project\" of the 2026 Bloomberg Green Watchlist for its continuous breakthroughs and innovations in solar cell technology, as well as its outstanding achievements in ESG and sustainable development. This recognition marks the high level of international acknowledgment by authoritative organizations of the efforts made by China's photovoltaic industry, spearheaded by LONGi, in the field of sustainable development.\nAs a responsible media organization, Bloomberg Green has developed the methodology for the \"Bloomberg Green Watchlist\" based on its own analysis of corporate data, combined with broadly consensus sustainable development assessment frameworks. This methodology, through cross-framework issue complementarity and weight integration, forms an assessment matrix covering 4 major dimensions, 16 core topics, and 41 sub-topics. It identifies 65 \"Metrics to Watch\" from a pool of 318 indicators, comprehensively measuring corporate ESG disclosure and practice levels.\nIn recent years, LONGi has consistently achieved breakthroughs in solar cell technology innovation, repeatedly setting new world records for conversion efficiency. Certified by Germany's Institute for Solar Energy Research Hamelin (ISFH), LONGi's independently developed HIBC cell achieved a conversion efficiency of 27.81%, once again setting a new world record for monocrystalline silicon cell efficiency. Certified by the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI), LONGi's independently developed crystalline silicon-perovskite two-terminal tandem solar cell achieved a conversion efficiency of 35%, once again setting a new world record for crystalline silicon-perovskite tandem cell efficiency.\nAs a leading enterprise in the photovoltaic industry, LONGi has also been committed to integrating ESG and sustainable development concepts into its corporate development strategy. Li Zhenguo, founder and Chief Technology Officer of LONGi, has explicitly stated, \"The photovoltaic industry inherently possesses ESG attributes.\" Mr. Li also shared a key data point: \"The PV industry consumes 0.4 kWh of electricity per watt from raw material ore to finished module. However, over its thirty-year lifecycle, through the amplification of solar energy, it can generate 45 kWh of electricity.\" This data vividly demonstrates the immense efficiency of PV technology in producing clean energy.\nLONGi's relentless efforts in the ESG field have yielded significant results. In 2024, the company's proportion of green electricity usage steadily increased to 47.5%, equivalent to reducing carbon emissions by approximately 2.5467 million tonnes. The company's Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions decreased by 37% compared to 2023, and Scope 3 emissions decreased by 26% year-on-year. In May 2025, LONGi was selected for the third time in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook (China Edition), once again demonstrating its outstanding performance in the ESG field.\nIn May of this year, at the \"First Global Enterprise Summit on Jointly Building a High-Quality Belt and Road,\" co-organized by the United Nations Global Compact and the Indonesian government, LONGi joined forces with photovoltaic industry chain enterprises such as JinkoSolar, JA Solar, Tongwei, and GCL to jointly launch the \"Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA).\" This initiative aims to promote comprehensive progress in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) fields within the photovoltaic industry and to foster a positive impact on international markets.\nIt is reported that the 24 companies currently participating in this initiative include leading enterprises across the global photovoltaic supply chain, ranging from silicon materials, wafers, cells, and modules to supporting material manufacturers such as solar glass and frames. This full-industry-chain collaborative model ensures that the initiative can drive green development across the entire sector from source to end. Under the framework of this initiative, the participating companies have committed to jointly promote the application of cleaner silicon purification technologies, encourage the development of low-silver-content paste technologies, support the adoption of regenerated aluminum materials, and reduce material usage through optimized profile structure design.\nShortly before this, during the COP30 Conference in Belém, Brazil, LONGi released its \"2024-2025 LONGi Climate Action White Paper\". This report marks the first time LONGi has comprehensively benchmarked against the International Sustainability Standards Board's IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard and relevant frameworks, systematically proposing the strategic ambition and implementation pathway to \"achieve net-zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2050.\" Simultaneously, LONGi also released its first \"Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Report\", systematically showcasing the company's commitments to biodiversity protection and sustainable development.\nAmid the global transition towards green and low-carbon energy, the sustainable development of the PV industry itself is increasingly coming into focus. LONGi's mission is precisely to make green energy an affordable, stable, and widely accessible solution for all through continuous technological breakthroughs and model innovation. We believe that in the future, the Chinese photovoltaic industry, spearheaded by LONGi, will not only provide green momentum for the global energy transition but also, through its own sustainable development, help build a greener, more inclusive, and more sustainable ecosystem for the industry.\nAbout LONGi\nFounded in 2000, LONGi (Stock code: 601012. SH) is committed to being the world's leading solar technology company, focusing on customer-driven value creation for full scenario energy transformation.\nUnder its mission of 'making the best of solar energy to build a green world', LONGi has dedicated itself to technology innovation and established several business sectors, covering mono silicon wafers, cells and modules, commercial & industrial distributed solar solutions, green energy solutions, building integrated photovoltaic and hydrogen equipment. As an international company, LONGi's business covers more than 160 countries and regions. Actively practicing its \"Solar for Solar\" concept, LONGi is accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy and promoting energy equity, enabling more people around the world to access affordable clean energy.\nMore details here: www.longi.com/",
