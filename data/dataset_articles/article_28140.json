  "text": "Health\nSeasoned Nutritionist Reveals One Desi Spice That Can Shield Your Lungs from Rising Air Pollution\n- Authored by:\nAshima Sharda Mahindra - Updated Dec 4, 2025, 12:13 IST\nNutritionist Kavita Devgan recommends cloves as a powerful natural remedy to protect the lungs from rising air pollution. Rich in eugenol and antioxidants, cloves reduce inflammation, ease congestion, and support immunity. They may be used by sucking a clove, brewing clove tea, or steaming—though medical guidance is advised before use.\nClove: The One Spice Experts Say Can Protect Your Lungs from Air Pollution\nEven as toxic air and pollution continue unabated across northern India, most people are suffering from itchy throat, annoying dry cough, that scratchy tickle, and even respiratory issues. According to doctors, the chemicals in the air you breathe are causing inflammation in your throat, leading to discomfort and long-term, life-threatening diseases.\nWhile you may not be able to escape the outside air, there is a huge support you can provide to recover, cleanse, and breathe freely again. Some homemade remedies, which include Ayurvedic tips, come in handy, like the use of clove or laung. According to nutritionist Kavita Devgan, “cloves are the best antidote for pollution that you can use today,” she told her followers on Instagram.\nCloves have anti-inflammatory and expectorant properties – both of which reduce inflammation and clear respiratory passages. It is loaded with a compound eugenol, which soothes your throat and fights swelling. Cloves can be used in remedies like tea to relieve coughs, colds, asthma, and bronchitis. However, experts warn against inhaling smoke from cloves, and it is important to consult a healthcare provider before using clove oil for any health condition.\n“Cloves also help clear congestion and ease breathing. Antioxidants neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress. It can also break up phlegm in the throat and esophagus and prevent respiratory tract infections,” said Devgan.\nHow to use cloves to reduce pollution effects?\nKeep a single clove under your tongue when you are stepping out and keep sucking on it.\n- Make a clove tea with one or two pods steeped in boiled water\n- Boil 2-3 clove pods in water and take steam at least twice a day\n- Clove’s benefits as an antioxidant to strengthen your immunity\nClove bud extract may be used as a food antioxidant. In many studies, it was observed that kidney functions, liver functions, and antioxidant status were improved with clove use. Before using clove or any herb for its health benefits, you need to contact your healthcare provider and get a proper diagnosis.\nClove can also be used as an oil, which stimulates your circulatory system, managing insomnia, anxiety, memory loss, depression, fatigue, and mental exhaustion. Clove oil also has an anti-depressant effect and can be used to treat mental fatigue.",
