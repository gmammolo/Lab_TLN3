  "text": "Backed by the EU, Trakya Farmers Pioneer Climate-Resilient Agriculture\nWith climate change accelerating land degradation and threatening the backbone of rural life, a group of scientists, public institutions, and farmers have joined forces to fight back. Their weapons: knowledge, precision, and the humble soil beneath their feet.\nThe EU has backed Tekirdağ Namık Kemal University and the agricultural directorates of Tekirdağ, Edirne, and Kırklareli to combat soil degradation and the climate crisis. The project is financed by the Climate Change Adaptation Grant Programme (CCAGP).\nThe project is called “İklimTrak” (ClimateTrak), officially known as “Land Degradation Neutrality for Climate Change Adaptation in the TR21 Trakya Region”.\nEuropean Union, 2025\nProf Dr Fatih Konukçu from Namık Kemal University\nAt the heart of the project is Prof Dr Fatih Konukçu, the project coordinator from Namık Kemal University in Tekirdağ. “We’re not just talking about doing things differently in farming,” he explains. “We’re modelling land degradation itself—analysing how it happens, and how it can be reversed. Our goal is climate adaptation, but the way to achieve it is through improving soil health.”\nThe science of saving soil\nSoil degradation, or desertification as Prof Konukçu more bluntly puts it, is the physical, chemical, and biological decline of soil. The causes are well known: intensive farming, erosion, the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and changes in land use such as converting agricultural land into industrial estates. Prolonged droughts and extreme weather, which are becoming increasingly common due to climate change, only exacerbate the situation, creating a recipe for ecological collapse.\nEuropean Union, 2025\nDr Bahadır Altürk and Dr Buse Önler are collecting soil samples\nIn Trakya, where agriculture has long been the economic lifeline, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. “What we’re seeing in recent decades,” says Project Data Collection and Processing Coordinator, Dr Bahadır Altürk, “is a consistent loss of organic matter in the topsoil — the most fertile layer. Once that’s gone, it's gone forever. And it’s happening faster due to rainfall-induced erosion.”\nProject Soil Analyst Dr Buse Önler, says the team is mapping the land’s condition in near-forensic detail through meticulous fieldwork involving digging ‘V’-shaped pits, collecting topsoil samples and analysing their organic content and pH levels. They are combining laboratory results with satellite imagery and socio-economic data to create a digital web-based Geographic Information System to support decision making.\nThis isn’t just an academic exercise. Farmers and policymakers can now log into the online platform, identify their land and view the associated risk scores for land degradation. They can then select from a list of tailored interventions, such as cover cropping, reduced tillage or increasing soil organic matter, and immediately view the projected improvements.\n“We’ve created a climate-resilient roadmap for farming,” says Prof Konukçu. “And importantly, we’re not doing this for the farmers. We’re doing it with them.”\nOld hands, new ideas\nOne of those farmers is experienced grower İmdat Güngör from Tekirdağ’s Yağcı village, who has more than 50 years’ experience in farming. As leader of the local 'Pioneer Farmers' group, he doesn't just adopt new techniques — he champions them.\n“The project taught me the value of direct seeding,” he says, referring to a conservation farming method in which seeds are sown without tilling the soil. “We don't plough the soil anymore, which means less erosion, greater moisture retention, and lower fuel costs. It’s a win all round.”\nEuropean Union, 2025\nFarmer İmdat Güngör\nGüngör’s village has converted over 1,000 decares of land for direct seeding. “We used to burn diesel just to break up the soil,” he says. “Now, we save 300–400 lira per decare. For many of us, that’s the difference between making a profit and making a loss.”\nBut he’s aware of the challenges ahead. 'Most farmers here are over 60. They learnt from their fathers and don't like to change things. They want to see results first. That’s why I share everything I’ve learned — because this project can’t succeed unless we bring others along.”\nA network of collaboration\nİklimTrak is not just a university-led experiment; it’s an extensive partnership. As well as Namık Kemal University, the project draws on the expertise of the provincial agricultural directorates in Edirne, Kırklareli and Tekirdağ, as well as key agricultural research institutes. The project is also supported by the Turkish Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change, as well as the EU.\nEuropean Union, 2025\nDr Bahadir Altürk and Prof Dr Fatih Konukçu\n‘So far, we’ve trained over 700 leading farmers and 150 technical staff,’ says Prof Konukçu. ‘They, in turn, are training others in their regions. That's how you scale change — person by person, plot by plot.”\nThe project has also produced a 30-minute training video, distributed comprehensive manuals for farmers and published a 300-page academic volume titled 'Climate-Responsive Plant Production', all of which support the transfer of knowledge across regions.\nSeeds of the future\nClimateTrak is doing more than just documenting degradation; it’s developing a strategy to build resilience for the future. In pilot fields, crop rotations involving the planting of legumes after wheat are being tested to restore nutrients. Direct seeding into wheat residue helps keep fields covered and moist, reducing erosion. Across the board, organic matter levels — often under 1.5% in Trakya — are being increased through scientific and local collaboration.\nAccording to the project, good soil means both good harvests and good climate outcomes. Prof Konukçu says that restoring soil health also locks in carbon, reduces emissions from machinery, and boosts biodiversity. It’s all connected.\nEU support rooted in Trakya soil\nEuropean Union, 2025\nThe Acting Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Türkiye, Jurgis Vilčinskas\nThe Acting Head of the Delegation of the European Union to Türkiye, Jurgis Vilčinskas says: “Through initiatives like İklimTrak, we see how science, tradition, and innovation can come together to build resilience from the ground up. This project not only supports sustainable farming in Trakya, it empowers local communities to become agents of climate action. The EU is proud to stand with Türkiye’s farmers, scientists, and institutions as they safeguard their land, their livelihoods, and our shared future.”\nNevertheless, challenges remain. Industrial expansion continues to encroach on arable land. Traditional mindsets can be slow to change. Climate volatility also makes every growing season uncertain. However, in places like Yağcı village, the foundations for change are already in place.",
