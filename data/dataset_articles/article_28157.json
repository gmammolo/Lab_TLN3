The Union Minister for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, launched the steel-cutting ceremony for the country's first all-electric green tug.\nBuilt for the Deendayal Port Authority (DPA) in Kandla, the vessel is being developed under the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP), a flagship initiative aimed at reducing emissions across India’s maritime sector.\nThe ceremony was attended online by Minister of State Shantanu Thakur, senior officials from the ministry, the DPA leadership, representatives from Netincon and Ripley, experts from Kongsberg and engineers from Atreya Shipyard, which is constructing the tug.\nSonowal described the project as a clear sign of India’s intention to integrate clean-energy technologies into port operations, stressing that the initiative aligns with the government’s broader sustainability vision.\nThe minister also noted that maritime modernisation is central to the government’s development push, stating that the all-electric tug demonstrates how innovation is being translated into practical and advanced infrastructure assets.\nThe DPA tug will have a 60-ton bollard pull capacity and operate with zero emissions, reduced noise and enhanced energy efficiency. According to officials, its electric propulsion and advanced navigation systems are expected to set new standards for fleet upgrades at major ports.\nUnder the GTTP, India plans to induct 50 green tugs by 2030, with 16 scheduled for deployment in the first phase between 2024 and 2027. Work orders have already been awarded at four major ports, with DPA becoming the first to commence construction.\nAlso Read: Centre Shares Timelines For Key Flyovers And Elevated Corridor Projects In Pune\nArjun Brij is an Editorial Associate at Swarajya.
