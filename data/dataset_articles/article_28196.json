  "text": "By Danny Merrell ,\n1 hours ago\nMoody Gardens is proud to announce the successful hatching of a Macaroni penguin chick born November 11 to adult penguins Gorgonzola and Bleu. The chick weighed 90 grams at hatch and is thriving under the care of Moody Gardens biologists.\nMacaroni penguins are native to Sub-Antarctic regions and are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to climate change, overfishing, and shifting ocean conditions. The new chick marks an important addition to the Moody Gardens colony, which is part of a broader effort to support and maintain healthy populations of this species.\nREAD MORE: Galveston Walmart is Considered One Of The Most Haunted Places\nThe chick and its parents have been moved off exhibit to a quiet, controlled area. They will remain there until the chick grows its full set of adult feathers, which is expected to take about six weeks. During this period, animal care staff will continue routine monitoring, including regular weight checks and a DNA test to determine the chick’s sex.\nMoody Gardens The Moody Gardens Aquarium Pyramid is home to one of the most diverse penguin collections in the United States, featuring Macaroni, Gentoo, Chinstrap, King, and Northern and Southern Rockhopper penguins, along with Humboldt penguins in an adjacent warm-climate habitat. Across more than 1.5 million gallons of water, the Aquarium Pyramid also features stingrays, sharks, seals, sea lions and more than 200 species of fish.\nThe Moody Gardens annual Holiday in the Gardens is underway and continues through January 3. The ICE LAND adventure area is once again featured this year, along with ice skating, and millions of twinkling lights scattered in the beautiful landscape.\nClick here to view photo gallery",
