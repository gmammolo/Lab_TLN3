  "text": "Livingston Man Arrested for Supplying Fatal Dose of Heroin and Meth in Montgomery County Overdose Case\nMONTGOMERY, TX -- On November 19, 2024, Detectives with the Montgomery County Narcotics Enforcement Team (MOCONET) responded to a residence in the 12000 block of Ridgecrest Drive in Montgomery County to assist with investigating the death of a 43-year-old male. During the initial investigation, evidence found at the location indicated that the male may have overdosed from the use of illicit narcotics. After the autopsy, results provided by the Montgomery County Forensic Center confirmed that the male died of the toxic effects of Heroin and Methamphetamine.\nAs a result of the investigation, the individual responsible for providing the Heroin and Methamphetamine to the decedent was identified as 62-year-old Douglas Hendon from Livingston, Texas. An arrest warrant was obtained, and he was arrested on April 7, 2025. Douglas was transported to the Montgomery County Jail, where he was charged with Delivery of a Controlled Substance causing Death for supplying Heroin and Methamphetamine that resulted in the death of a Montgomery County resident.\nThe Montgomery County Narcotics Enforcement Team is a cooperative multi-agency task force which consists of law enforcement agencies from, Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office, Walker County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Department of Public Safety-CID, Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office, Homeland Security Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Participating agencies recognized that a special collaborative effort was necessary to more effectively combat the drug distribution throughout the area.",
