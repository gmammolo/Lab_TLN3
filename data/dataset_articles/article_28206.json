  "text": "LAGOS – Nigeria took a major leap toward strengthening its sustainable finance ecosystem and tackling its plastic pollution crisis as FMDQ Group PLC, in partnership with the Financial Centre for Sustainability (FC4S) Lagos, Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Africa, and Chapel Hill Denham, sealed a strategic collaboration with Kaltani International Ventures Limited, one of the country’s leading plastic recycling firms.\nThe agreement was formalised at a high-level signing ceremony on November 24, 2025, in Lagos, bringing together senior representatives from all participating institutions.\nThe new alliance, convened under the Nigerian Green Bond Market Development Programme, aims to accelerate the development of market-based climate solutions, strengthen circular-economy value chains, and mobilise private capital at scale for environmental projects.\nAt the heart of the partnership is an innovative financing product designed by FC4S Lagos with the support of FSD Africa and FMDQ Group.\nThe instrument, expected to become Africa’s first corporate plastic- and carbon-linked debt product, will expand access to sustainable financing for Kaltani as it advances large-scale waste recovery, recycling, and carbon-reduction initiatives across Nigeria.\nThe initiative is both pioneering and urgently needed. Nigeria ranks among the world’s top 10 producers of plastic waste, generating millions of tonnes annually with limited recycling infrastructure.\nWhile the World Bank introduced the first Plastic Waste Reduction-Linked Bond in 2024 for projects in Ghana and Indonesia, the Kaltani initiative marks the continent’s first private-sector attempt to link corporate financing to measurable plastic recovery and carbon performance.\nCommenting on the partnership, Joy V. Kendi, Associate, Financial Markets at FSD Africa, said the collaboration demonstrates the potential of local capital markets to unlock climate-smart economic growth.\n“FSD Africa is proud to partner with Kaltani, FMDQ, and Chapel Hill Denham on this pioneering initiative that merges circular-economy innovation with sustainable capital markets,” she said.\n“Nigeria is paving the way for what could become Africa’s first corporate plastic- and carbon-linked instrument. We have begun Phase I preparation, including rigorous carbon and biochar credit assessments. This is a bold step toward unlocking Africa’s next generation of climate-finance solutions.”\nKaltani CEO, Engr. Obi Charles Nnanna, described the partnership as evidence that Africa can lead globally in waste-to-wealth innovation and sustainable industrialisation.\n“By working with world-class institutions, we are unlocking a new model for circular-economy finance—one that turns waste into wealth, jobs, and measurable climate impact,” he said. “This is profit with purpose, showing that climate finance can be local, credible, and transformational.”\nFMDQ Group, through its Green Exchange platform, has been at the centre of Nigeria’s drive to deepen its sustainable capital-markets infrastructure.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, FMDQ’s Group COO, Tumi Sekoni, said the partnership reinforces Nigeria’s readiness to embrace innovative sustainability-linked instruments.\n“This initiative aligns closely with the aspirations of FMDQ’s Green Exchange and strengthens the market’s capacity to develop structured finance solutions that address environmental challenges while supporting a resilient, competitive economy,” she said.\nThe partnership marks a key milestone in Nigeria’s transition toward sophisticated, globally aligned sustainable-finance practices. It signals growing investor confidence in the country’s environmental-finance potential and showcases Nigeria as an emerging destination for climate-aligned investments.\nBeyond financing, the collaboration underscores a shared vision of using capital markets as engines of environmental regeneration. By blending circular-economy solutions with innovative financing models, the coalition aims to demonstrate how local markets can mobilise capital at scale for climate resilience and industrial sustainability.\nAs Nigeria works to combat mounting plastic pollution and attract green investment, the FMDQ– Kaltani partnership stands out as a groundbreaking model—one that could shape the future of climate finance across Africa.",
