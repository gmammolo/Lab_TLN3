  "text": "The Programme Director of HortiNigeria, Mohammed Salasi Idris, has said that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are essential drivers of innovation in Nigeria’s horticulture sector, but many perform below their potential due to poor infrastructure.\nAccording to him, post-harvest losses account for over 45% of produce in the horticulture value chain, depriving farmers of significant revenue and necessitating the intervention of HortiNigeria, a programme funded by the Dutch Embassy in Nigeria.\n“HortiNigeria has cut down post-harvest losses by 83% in its intervention areas by introducing and deploying cold storage facilities and other strategies. Off-grid cold storage solutions, such as Ecotutu’s solar-powered facilities, can extend the shelf life of fresh produce by up to 21 days, allowing farmers to reduce waste, sell at better prices, and boost their income,” he said.\nSPONSOR AD Idris explained that the programme has brought together farmers, traders, input providers, and innovators to collaborate with Ecotutu in building cold-room infrastructure to address postharvest losses.\nHe said Ecotutu later secured space to install a 10-metric-tonne solar-powered cold room at Mile 12, marking the company’s entry into a high-demand market and laying the foundation for broader expansion.\nIn 2023 and 2024, Ecotutu partnered with two of the programme’s business champions to develop two 30-metric-tonne cold storage facilities in Ogun and Oyo states, with continued support from HortiNigeria. The first was established at Soilless Farm Lab in Awowo, and the second at the National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) in Ibadan.\nThese installations, he said, are more convenient because they are closer to farmers’ production sites, helping them reduce spoilage, stabilise income, and gain stronger control over market timing. With the new storage facilities, farmers and aggregators can now manage surpluses more strategically and respond to price changes without compromising product quality.\n“HortiNigeria is more than a development programme—it is a story of people, partnerships, and progress. Over the past four years, we have witnessed how targeted support in knowledge, technology, finance, and policy can transform lives, strengthen value chains, and position horticulture as a driver of economic growth in Nigeria,” Idris said.\nSERIOUS ADVICE:\nAs a Nigerian living here or in the diaspora, DO YOU HAVE A PLAN B?
