Schaeffler India partnered with BAIF Development Research Foundation to address water scarcity, low agricultural productivity, and livelihood challenges in the region.\nThe initiative created 143,000 cubic meters of water conservation potential through infrastructure including water absorption trenches, recharge ponds, gabions, and boulder structures. The project treated 1,268 acres of land to reduce soil erosion and improve moisture retention.\nAccording to the company, the project resulted in a 40% improvement in cropping intensity and increased household income from ₹60,312 to ₹1,06,938 on average. Additionally, 84% of households reported enhanced water access, while dependency on tanker water decreased by 70%.\nMore than 400 rural families benefited from the project through soil and water conservation, agricultural development, micro-irrigation support, and sustainable farming practices.\nShibi Mathew, Head of HR and CSR at Schaeffler India, said the company views water security as fundamental to building resilient communities. She noted that the recognition reinforces the company's commitment to expanding similar initiatives across the country.\nAn independent assessment by Sattva Consulting validated the project's impact on water availability, soil health, agriculture, and household income. Schaeffler India is extending the watershed management approach to its CSR geographies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.\nThe Pune-based motion technology company operates five manufacturing plants in India, three R&D centers, and seven sales offices, employing over 3,700 people nationwide.\nRELATED ARTICLES\nDisseqt AI Partners with Tata Technologies and Infosys for Agentic AI Solutions\nBangalore-based platform to help develop customised agentic AI applications for automobile and fintech sectors worldwide...\nTata Motors Integrates Dolby Atmos into All-New Sierra SUV\nPremium audio system marks collaboration between Indian automaker and global entertainment technology leader.\nLexus India Launches New RX 'Exquisite' Grade Starting at Rs 89.99 Lakh\nThe new mid-tier variant joins the RX 350h lineup with hybrid technology, premium features, and pricing positioned betwe...",
