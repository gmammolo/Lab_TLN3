  "text": "FUJIFILM Business Innovation Achieves Virtually 100% Renewable Energy Usage for Electricity at All Production Sites in the Asia-Pacific Region\nDecember 4, 2025\nTokyo, December 4, 2025 – FUJIFILM Business Innovation announces that it has switched the electricity used*1 at all its production sites in the Asia-Pacific region to virtually 100% renewable energy, reducing CO₂ emissions by approximately 8,391*2 tons and contributing to climate change mitigation. The production sites covered by this initiative are FUJIFILM Manufacturing Shenzhen Corp., FUJIFILM Manufacturing Hai Phong Co., Ltd., and FUJIFILM Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou) Corp.\nUnder its CSR plan, Sucastainable Value Plan 2030, the Fujifilm Group has set a decarbonization target to fully operate on carbon-free energy and achieve net zero CO₂ emissions by fiscal year 2040. To reach this goal, FUJIFILM Business Innovation has developed a roadmap and is implementing*3 initiatives based on the following three steps: (1) energy conservation (reducing electricity consumption through business process transformation), (2) energy generation (creating renewable energy through measures such as installing solar power systems), and (3) renewable energy procurement (covering any shortfall externally through external sourcing). The achievement of virtually 100% renewable electricity usage at all production sites in the Asia-Pacific region was made possible through the implementation of energy-saving and energy-generation initiatives at each site, supplemented by renewable energy certificates*4 to cover any remaining shortfall.\nAs a result of promoting energy-saving measures primarily at production and development sites, which account for approximately 70% of the company’s CO₂ emissions, FUJIFILM Business Innovation has reduced electricity consumption by about 30% compared to fiscal year 2019 levels by fiscal year 2024. Going forward, the company will continue to advance energy-saving and energy-generation initiatives not only at all production sites worldwide but also at offices and R&D facilities, while further accelerating the introduction of renewable energy. Through these efforts, FUJIFILM Business Innovation aims to reduce environmental impact and contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society.\n- *1 In fiscal year 2024, approximately 17,757 MWh of electricity was consumed.\n- *2 CO₂ emissions from electricity generation in fiscal year2024 were calculated on a market-based approach (using the CO₂ emission factor per kWh disclosed by power companies).\n- *3 Main sites that have already switched to virtually 100% renewable energy through the three-step initiatives include: FUJIFILM Eco-Manufacturing (Suzhou) Corp., FUJIFILM Business Innovation Corp.’s headquarters, and FUJIFILM Business Innovation Japan Corp.’s headquarters.\n- *4 Certificates that represent the added value of renewable energy (zero CO₂ emissions) separately from the electricity itself and link it to the amount of electricity consumed.\nMass Media Contacts\nFor reporters with an inquiry about FUJIFILM Business Innovation\nMass Media Contacts\nFor reporters with an inquiry about FUJIFILM Business Innovation",
