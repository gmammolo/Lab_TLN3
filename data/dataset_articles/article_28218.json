  "text": "Want more from your lawn than just grass? You could turn it into a mini “national park.”\nMeet Homegrown National Park, a nationwide grassroots movement that invites property owners to restore wildlife habitats through sustainable planting and the removal of invasive species.\nHere’s how it works: Swap a portion of your lawn for native plants that support food webs for local fauna, then watch your yard transform into a natural oasis where wildlife thrives.\nRegistered habitats are tracked on a digital biodiversity map, so you can see which Music City neighbors are pitching in.\nReady to get started on your own turf? Learn how to register your green space and browse beginner-friendly planting tips.",
