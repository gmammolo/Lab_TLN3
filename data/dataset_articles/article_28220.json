  "text": "Reduction of 2,200 Tons of Greenhouse Gases\nGwangsan District in Gwangju is expanding the adoption of renewable energy sources such as solar power. On December 4, the district announced, \"In connection with the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment's renewable energy convergence support project, we are expanding related facilities in local buildings and industrial complexes.\"\nSince the project began in 2020, Gwangsan District has installed renewable energy facilities at 1,154 solar power sites, 39 solar thermal sites, and 1 geothermal site. The district stated that this has resulted in annual energy cost savings of about 800 million won and a reduction of 2,200 tons of greenhouse gases. This is equivalent to the effect of planting 18,300 pine trees.\nFor next year, Gwangsan District has allocated a budget of 2.4 billion won, about twice as much as this year, and plans to add renewable energy facilities at 297 additional sites, including solar and solar thermal installations. A district official said, \"We will strive to establish a sustainable urban system in which eco-friendly values become part of citizens' daily lives.\"\n© The Asia Business Daily(www.asiae.co.kr).
