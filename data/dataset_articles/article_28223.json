  "text": "Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd. (\"Chunghwa\" or \"the Company\") has once again received the prestigious Jade Award, the highest honor of The Asset's Corporate Sustainability Leadership Awards (formerly known as the ESG Corporate Awards), marking its fifth consecutive year of recognition.\nChunghwa stands as the sole company in Taiwan to achieve the top distinction for five consecutive years across multinational and cross-sector assessments, underscoring its ESG excellence and sustained international acclaim. Looking ahead, the Company remains committed to advancing shared prosperity with the environment, society, and all stakeholders, as it strives to establish itself as a global benchmark for sustainable development.\nThe Asset Corporate Sustainability Leadership Awards, widely esteemed in Asia, leverage insights from institutional investors and industry analysts. Each year, a professional judging panel comprehensively evaluates various aspects of Asian publicly-listed companies, including financial performance, corporate governance, social responsibility, environmental responsibility, and investor relations. The awards recognize companies demonstrating outstanding ESG achievements and transparency.\nChunghwa Telecom underlined that, amid tighter international sustainability disclosure requirements, escalating climate risks, and rapid AI-driven technological change, the company has consistently upheld the spirit of innovation and value creation, driving sustainable transformation through AI empowerment.\nThe Company not only strengthens network resilience to address pressing climate challenges, but also applies AIoT monitoring technologies to biodiversity conservation initiatives. In addition, Chunghwa is committed to expanding internet access, supporting rural students and disadvantaged communities, and providing smart home applications and digital learning services for seniors. Furthermore, in 2025, the Company raised the ESG-linked portion of senior executive compensation to 30% and issued NT$3.5 billion in biodiversity-inclusive sustainability bonds, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development while advancing climate governance and sustainable finance. With a dual focus on sustainability and digital transformation, Chunghwa Telecom applies its core technological capabilities to enhance climate resilience and promote ecological sustainability, putting corporate social responsibility into practice across all fronts.\nChunghwa Telecom was upgraded to MSCI ESG AAA rating in May, becoming one of the world's few telco to receive this honor, and Taiwan's first AAA-rated operator. Moreover, the Company has, for three consecutive years, achieved top 5% ESG performance in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook and maintained consecutive inclusion in the Dow Jones Best-in-Class Indices (formerly known as the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, DJSI) for both World and Emerging Markets, showcasing its robust sustainability capabilities and solidifying its international sustainability leadership. By embedding sustainability into corporate governance, Chunghwa Telecom addresses evolving global sustainability regulations and operational risks, aligning growth with net-zero objectives. The Company also leverages AI to enhance resilience and service stability under extreme climate conditions, further advancing its sustainable vision of \"green, low-carbon, digital empowerment, integrity, and transparency.\nAttachments\nOriginal document Permalink Disclaimer\nChunghwa Telecom Co.
