  "text": "Uzbekistan to Spend $75.6 Mln on Air Pollution Measures in 2025\nPhoto: Unsplash\nUzbekistan will allocate 900 bn soums ($75.6 mln) in 2025 to improve air quality, Vice Premier and Minister of Economy and Finance Jamshid Kuchkarov told the Legislative Chamber of the Oliy Majlis while responding to a deputy’s inquiry.\nThe funds will be used to modernise filtration systems at industrial plants and enhance environmental conditions across the country. Deputies also asked how much the 2026 budget would provide for installing modern filters and cleaning systems, alongside broader ecological initiatives.\nDeputy Chairman of the National Committee on Ecology and Climate Change Jusipbek Kazbekov said an additional 548 bn soums ($46 mln) is expected to be allocated in 2026 from extra revenues.\nKazbekov added that a special commission in Tashkent operates round the clock to improve environmental conditions. The commission conducts inspections, temporarily halts operations at certain enterprises, and implements measures aligned with both short-term and long-term plans.\nKursiv also reports that Saida Mirziyoyeva, head of Uzbekistan’s presidential administration, has emphasised that environmental damage cannot be justified by profit.",
