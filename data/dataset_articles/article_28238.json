  "text": "Bali, Indonesia — Terratai has announced the launch of HIVE (Holistic Investments in Vital Ecosystems), a new blended finance facility designed to channel large-scale capital into nature-based enterprises working across Southeast Asia’s most critical ecosystems.\nSoutheast Asia is home to some of the planet’s most vital ecosystems, from tropical forests and mangroves to coral reefs and peatlands. These landscapes and seascapes sustain over 650 million people, safeguard food and water security, and store vast amounts of carbon. Yet they are also disappearing at alarming rates. As deforestation, land degradation, and climate change accelerate, the region faces an urgent need for new forms of finance that can support both people and nature.\nAcross these critically important ecosystems, early-stage businesses are pioneering solutions in regenerative agriculture, sustainable forestry, and the blue economy. Yet these ventures often face a lack of patient, flexible capital to grow — a structural financing gap that limits private investment in nature-based solutions.\nHIVE’s model bridges this gap by combining catalytic philanthropy with concessional and private capital, ensuring promising enterprises can scale their impact while delivering measurable outcomes for nature and people.\nWith a total target size of US$85 million, HIVE consists of two linked vehicles:\nThe Pipeline Builder (US$35 million) provides early-stage capital up to US$0.5 million, coupled with hands-on venture-building support to incubate and strengthen emerging enterprises. The Investment Fund (US$50 million) offers early-growth investments of up to US$3 million for ventures ready to expand and attract further institutional investment. Together, these vehicles will mobilise over US$200 million in total finance for nature, protect or restore six million hectares of ecosystems, and improve livelihoods for more than 450,000 people by 2035. The facility directly contributes to the Global Biodiversity Framework’s 30×30 target and supports regional climate and sustainability commitments.\nHIVE is led by Terratai, which was founded in 2023 to grow companies that help nature recover and thrive. Terratai blends catalytic finance with deep venture-building expertise, creating a bridge between early innovation and scalable investment.\n“HIVE has the potential to reshape the future of Asia’s vital ecosystems and the communities who steward them,” said Yuni Choi, Co-founder & Head of Investments at Terratai. “By deploying philanthropic and concessional capital strategically, we build investable pipelines and unlock private investment at scale, creating a virtuous cycle that funds innovation, protects ecosystems, and strengthens resilient livelihoods. For donors and investors alike,\nHIVE offers a compelling and collaborative pathway to turn finance into tangible outcomes for people and the planet.”\nPublish your content with EB Publishing It's about who you reach.
