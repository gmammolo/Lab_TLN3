  "text": "Vartega makes e-commerce storefront available for sustainable carbon fiber materials purchase\nOnline platform aims to build a better understanding of Vartega’s materials business for customers, while streamlining the browsing and purchase of product samples.\nCarbon fiber recycler Vartega (Denver, Colo., U.S.) has launched an e- commerce storefront, now live at www.vartega.com/order-samples. This milestone marks a significant step forward in Vartega’s mission to make high-quality, sustainable carbon fiber materials more accessible to businesses worldwide.\nThe online storefront offers a streamlined platform for purchasing sample quantities of Vartega’s recycled carbon fiber (rCF) products. The company’s flagship EasyFeed Bundle product lines, for example, are specifically engineered for thermoplastic compounding in support of injection molding and additive manufacturing applications. Vartega also sells non-oversized chopped fiber for use in sheet molding compound (SMC), bulk molding compound (BMC) and nonwoven fabric applications, and will soon offer off-the-shelf standard compounds of rCF filled nylon 6 and polypropylene.\nNotably, the online e-commerce store enables customers to browse, compare and purchase samples of Vartega’s products directly online, quickly and easily. Larger volume orders will still be handled through the normal contracting and purchase order process, but the e-commerce storefront streamlines the purchase of small orders for trials and product development.\nThe storefront offers intuitive navigation and enhanced search capabilities, making it simple for customers to find the products they need. Comprehensive descriptions, specifications and use-case examples provide transparency and confidence in product selection. A more responsive design makes the online store easy to use for desktop and mobile devices, and its payment processing is seamless and secure.\n“The launch of our e-commerce platform is a great advance in convenience for our customers,” says Doug Mandic, CCO of Vartega. “As our product offering has grown, we embarked on this project to make it easier for customers to understand our array of options. This storefront not only reflects our dedication to sustainability but also demonstrates our commitment to delivering value and convenience to our customers by simplifying access to recycled carbon fiber.”\nTo celebrate the launch, Vartega is offering an exclusive bundle of logo stickers and bicycle tire levers for first-time customers who make a purchase through the online store.\nRelated Content\n-\nAirbus works to improve the life cycle of composites in future aircraftThis companion article to CW's September 2024 Airbus Illescas plant tour discusses recycling, LCA, biocomposites, Fast Track technologies, qualification and more.\n-\nAll-recycled, needle-punched nonwoven CFRP slashes carbon footprint of Formula 2 seatDallara and Tenowo collaborate to produce a race-ready Formula 2 seat using recycled carbon fiber, reducing CO2 emissions by 97.5% compared to virgin materials.\n-\nPartners recycle A350 composite production waste into adjustable-length rods for MFFDHerone, Spiral RTC, Teijin Carbon Europe and Collins Aerospace Almere recycle A350 thermoplastic composite clips/cleats waste into rods for the all-thermoplastic composite Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator’s crown.",
