  "text": "India’s oil scene just recorded a surprising twist — and Nayara Energy is at the centre of it.\nAfter months of pressure from EU sanctions, the Rosneft-backed refiner has suddenly doubled its fuel exports in November. From 75,000 barrels per day in October to 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November — its highest level since March.\nSo, what changed?\nBack in July, the European Union slapped sanctions on Nayara. While the US hasn’t targeted the refiner directly, Rosneft — Nayara’s main shareholder — has been sanctioned, adding indirect pressure.\nThe impact was immediate:\nDifficulty sourcing crude oil\nDisrupted export channels\nShipping partners backing out to avoid regulatory trouble\nBut disruption also forced innovation.\nNayara now sources 100% of its crude from Russia. In November alone, it imported 408,000 bpd, the highest since May. And because Russian crude is available at a steep discount due to global sanctions, Nayara has found itself operating very close to its maximum profitable capacity.\nCheaper crude → lower refining cost → higher margins → more exports.\nWith old markets becoming harder to access, Nayara has expanded into new destinations:\nBahamas\nTaiwan\nSudan\nBrazil\nTurkey\nInterestingly, almost one-third of Nayara’s exports didn’t go directly to a final customer. Instead, they traveled through ship-to-ship (STS) hubs like Fujairah (UAE) and Sohar (Oman) — both known for helping obscure the final destination of sensitive oil cargoes.\nThis isn’t unheard of. Iran and Russia routinely use the same tactic to avoid sanction-linked scrutiny.\nA mix of factors worked in Nayara’s favour:\nRefining capacity back near optimal levels\nDiscounted Russian crude supply\nShrinking Russian refined exports (after Ukrainian drone attacks)\nNew buyers willing to deal despite sanctions\nFlexible logistics networks using STS and transshipment hubs\nIn short, the company is capitalizing on a reshuffled global oil market where traditional trade lines have blurred.\nThis export surge signals something larger:\nIndia is emerging as a key refining hub in a post-sanctions world.\nRefiners like Nayara benefit from buying cheap Russian crude and selling refined fuel at global prices.\nCountries avoiding direct purchase from Russia find Indian fuel a convenient workaround.\nIn other words, India is becoming the middleman in global energy rerouting.\nIf geopolitical conditions remain unchanged, Nayara’s model could continue thriving:\nHigh import volumes\nFlexible export routing\nExpansion into sanction-neutral markets\nBut the risk remains:\nAny future secondary sanctions\nIncreased scrutiny of ship-to-ship transfers\nVolatility in Russian crude availability\nFor now, though, Nayara has found its rhythm — and it’s exporting at full volume.\nA few months ago, sanctions threatened to cripple Nayara Energy.\nToday, with discounted Russian supply and creative trade logistics, the company is not just surviving — it’s scaling up.\nThe oil market may be global, but right now, Nayara’s playbook is hyper-local, opportunistic, and working.",
