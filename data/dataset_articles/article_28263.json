  "text": "The town of Leland provided a progress report on the creation of its first-ever nature preserve, which the town notes is a major investment in conservation, recreation and the well-being of the community.\nThis initiative is intended to provide residents and visitors with a lasting space to connect with nature, enjoy outdoor activities and experience the beauty and history of the area. The land is planned to remain in its natural state in the short-term and will be improved over time to include hiking trails, wildlife observation opportunities, and environmental education programs.\nThe preserve will be anchored by a recent acquisition of 533 acres of forested land near the intersection of NC Highway 87 and Colon Mintz Road along the Batarora Branch waterway, which ultimately flows into the northwest Cape Fear River. This purchase brings the total acreage the Town owns in the area to 999.96 acres.\n“This is a historic step for Leland,” Mayor Brenda Bozeman said. “With this recent addition, our community is one step closer to having a dedicated nature preserve, a place for residents to explore the outdoors, learn about our environment and create lasting memories with family and friends. Preserving 1,000 acres of land is a significant investment in the health, recreation and quality of life of our residents.”\nThe property lies within an area rich in natural and cultural heritage, featuring forested wetlands and upland pine habitats, and is home to diverse plant and wildlife species.\nThe town of Leland will continue to pursue additional opportunities to expand the preserve, reinforcing its commitment to preserving green spaces for current and future generations. Visible improvements to the property, such as trail improvements, parking and restroom facilities, and programming to engage the community in conservation and environmental stewardship, are anticipated within the next three to five years.\nThe town will evaluate needs and determine specific initiatives through the Parks, Recreation, and Open Spaces (PROS) plan process, which will include public engagement to ensure the preserve’s development reflects community priorities.",
