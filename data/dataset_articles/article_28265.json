  "text": "Mars investing $20 million in sustainable rice sourcing to help farmers manage climate variability and protect livelihoods\nThis $20M (USD) investment from 2020–2030 will help rice farmers to adopt climate-smart agriculture practices on their farms\n- Rice-growing regions across the U.S., Europe, India, Pakistan and Thailand are experiencing unprecedented climate variability, with global rice yields projected to decline by 10-15% by 2050 under current trends according to the IPCC1.\n- Mars, makers of Ben’s Original™, Tasty Bite® and Seeds of Change™, will invest a total of $20 million over the decade (2020–2030) in sustainable rice sourcing programs2, aimed at helping its farmers to adopt climate-smart agriculture practices, while improving income security and livelihoods.\n- The investment commitment, announced today through its\nnew Raising Rice Right platform, will look to build on the company’s continued work and help to transform rice farming practices, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water usage, while protecting farmers' yields.\nLONDON, UK (December 4, 2025) – Today, Mars is announcing a $20 million (USD) investment in sustainable rice sourcing over the decade (2020–2030) through its new Raising Rice Right platform, as climate change places unprecedented pressures on rice farming communities around the world.\nRice is a daily staple for 3.5 billion people3 and provides income to around 19% of the world's population4. Yet, traditional rice production uses approximately 40% of the world's irrigation water5 and accounts for up to 10% of global methane emissions6. Latest research from Mars showed that 63% of people across the UK eat rice once a week or more7, with the nation consuming 2.3 billion bowls of rice annually each year8.\nWith the impact of climate change intensifying, the need to transform rice farming and build resilient, sustainable supply chains has never been more urgent. Recent IPCC and FAO reports warn that global rice yields could decline by 10-15% by 2050 under current trends, with climate shocks becoming more frequent9.\n\"Rice is a daily staple for billions of people and provides an income to millions of farmers around the world, but climate change is placing extraordinary pressure on this vital crop,\" said Dale Creaser, Global Vice President of Supply Chain, Mars Food & Nutrition.\n\"As the owners of Ben’s Original™, one of the world’s largest rice brands, we have a responsibility to act. This $20 million investment is about backing our farmers with the tools, technology and training support they need to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.\nIt’s also about future-proofing our business to ensure we’re building a resilient food supply chain. We're committed to making rice farming more sustainable and protecting yields and livelihoods for our farmers today and for generations to come.\"\nClimate-smart agriculture: the path forward\nMars is working with its farmers and suppliers to implement various climate-smart agriculture practices that have been proven to reduce water usage and greenhouse gas emissions, while protecting yields.\nOne of these practices is \"alternate wetting and drying\" (AWD), a practice that can reduce the amount of water used by up to 30% and reduce GHG emissions by over 40%10. Rather than keeping rice fields continuously flooded, AWD involves periodically draining fields, significantly reducing methane emissions and water consumption without compromising yields.\nThe ongoing investment will enable Mars to:\n- Scale climate-smart agriculture practices: Working directly with its rice farmers and suppliers to implement climate-smart agriculture practices like AWD that reduce environmental impact, while maintaining productivity. A great example is that of the Whitakers, farmers in Arkansas, U.S., who supply rice to Mars. They have reduced their water usage by 60% and achieved up to 60% lower GHG emissions compared to average farms in the region as a result of implementing AWD.\n- Provide additional training and support: Equipping farming communities with the knowledge, tools and technology needed to successfully adopt climate-smart agriculture practices. This includes working with smallholder farmers in Thailand, Pakistan and India. Through the Sustainable Aromatic Rice Initiative (SARI) in Thailand, Mars Food & Nutrition, GIZ and Herba trained over 1,400 farmers, 66% of whom were women, in climate-smart agriculture practices, improving yields for all participating farmers while reducing impact on the planet.\n- Continue to build farmer resilience: As part of the Sustainable in a Generation Plan, Mars is committed to ensuring 100% of farmers in its supply chain at risk of poverty are reached by programs designed to enable them to thrive, supporting long-term economic stability for farming communities around the world.\n- Drive industry collaboration: Playing a continued leadership role as a proud founding member of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), a global alliance working to promote sustainable rice farming, empower smallholder farmers and reduce the environmental footprint of rice.\nProtecting our planet, supporting our farmers\nAs a critical commodity for Mars Food & Nutrition, home of brands including Ben’s Original™, Tasty Bite® and Seeds of Change™, and with 62% of UK consumers viewing rice as a staple of their diet11, rice is at the heart of the company's sustainability strategy.\nThis investment is just one part of Mars' Sustainable in a Generation plan, launched in 2017. Mars has set science-based environmental goals including reducing total greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 50% by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 (against a 2015 baseline). The Sustainable in a Generation plan also commits to meaningfully improve the lives of 1 million people across Mars’ value chain to enable them to thrive.\n- Impacts of climate change on rice production and strategies for mitigation and adaptation: A review.
