  "text": "Turning Garbage into Growth: Ludhiana Students Win at Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025 with AI-Enabled Composting Innovation\nShare open/close\nTheir innovation automates composting, cutting processing time by nearly 50%\nWinning team receives ₹1 crore incubation support at IIT Delhi\nIn a country generating over 62 million tonnes of waste every year, a trio of Class 12 students of B. C. M. Arya Model Sr. Sec. School Ludhiana is proving that technology and empathy can drive real change. Abhishek Dhanda, Prabhkirat Singh, and Rachita Chandok have developed ‘Prithvi Rakshak’ (Protector of the Earth) — a smart, modular vermicomposting system that automates organic waste management and turns garbage into growth.\nThe innovation has earned the trio a spot among the four national winners of Samsung Solve for Tomorrow 2025, under the theme Environmental Sustainability through Technology. The winning teams received ₹1 crore incubation support at IIT Delhi’s FITT to refine their prototypes and scale their impact.\n“We wanted composting to be faster, smarter and scalable,” says Abhishek.\n“Our biggest learning was that empathy can be a design tool,” adds Rachita.\nTraditional vermicomposting takes up to 90 days and requires significant space and manual handling. Prithvi Rakshak cuts the composting cycle by nearly 50 percent, from 90 days to just 30 days by combining sensors, modular compartments, and intelligent controls — making eco-friendly waste processing viable even in cities.\nThe system Vermikendra outputs:\n- Vermicompost – nutrient-rich soil enhancer\n- Vermiwash – natural liquid fertilizer\n- Vermisticks – compact compost sticks for terrace gardens\n“Our goal is to pilot this with municipalities and Smart City Missions,” says Prabhkirat.\n“Innovation is about impact — and turning waste into a resource.”\nSupported through Samsung’s flagship CSR programme, Solve for Tomorrow, and mentorship from experts at IIT Delhi, the students are now preparing to take their solution to farms, homes and cities across India — helping build a cleaner, circular future.\nCorporate > Citizenship\nFor any issues related to customer service, please go to samsung.com/in/support for assistance.\nFor media inquiries, please contact corpcommindia@samsung.com.",
