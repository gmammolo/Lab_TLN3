  "text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 (Bernama) -- The Federal Government has expressed its gratitude to Sultan Ibrahim, King of Malaysia, for granting permission to use two high-powered airboats owned by His Majesty for flood rescue operations.\nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said the royal support and assistance reflect Sultan Ibrahim’s deep concern for the safety and welfare of the people, especially those in flood-hit areas.\n“On behalf of the MADANI Government, I extend our highest appreciation. This support will strengthen our preparedness and streamline rescue operations should a second wave of flooding occur,” Anwar said in a Facebook post.\nHe added that close cooperation among agencies would help enhance aid delivery and safeguard public safety.\nAccording to a statement posted on Sultan Ibrahim’s Facebook page earlier, the King granted the Federal Government permission to deploy two of his high-powered airboats for flood rescue operations in view of the current unpredictable weather and to ensure rescue agencies are prepared should a second wave of flooding occur.\nIn March 2023, three of the King’s airboats were also mobilised to rescue, evacuate and assist flood victims in Johor. The assets were also used to deliver food supplies to Orang Asli settlements in Kluang, which were cut off by the disaster.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2025 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",
