  "text": "Analysis finds clear improvement in Lahore’s November air quality\nNo day hit the ‘extremely hazardous’ mark this November\nAn analysis by the Air Initiative, an environmental monitoring organisation, shows that Lahore’s air quality in November this year recorded a significant improvement compared to the same month last year.\nAccording to the latest data, not a single day in November reached the extremely hazardous pollution level of 300 or above, a stark contrast to last November when the pollution index remained beyond this threshold for several consecutive days.\n“The daily average pollution level in November 2025 stood at 237 micrograms per cubic meter. This marks a 56 per cent decline compared to last year’s highest level of 539 micrograms per cubic meter,” said Maryam Shah, Head of Communications at the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative. She added that a notable reduction was also seen in the monthly average, which dropped by 37 per cent to 181 micrograms per cubic meter. Furthermore, on an annual basis, the overall air pollution level has reportedly fallen by approximately 15 per cent.\nShe noted that the severe pollution factors observed last year, which had enveloped the city in prolonged smoke and smog, did not appear this time. According to her, the absence of these intense triggers played a key role in preventing pollution from escalating to extreme levels.\nRead: Experts blame weak implementation as Lahore's air quality worsens\nExperts, meanwhile, emphasise that weather conditions also contributed to the improvement. They highlight that stronger winds and better atmospheric mixing helped reduce the rate at which pollutants accumulated in the air. However, they caution that despite the disappearance of days with extremely high pollution, the fundamental baseline level of pollution in the city remains troubling.\nShe further explained that all 30 days of November were classified as unsafe when measured against Punjab’s environmental standards, where the health-acceptable limit is set at 35 micrograms per cubic meter. She stressed that although the downward trend in pollution is encouraging, it cannot yet be considered a permanent shift.\nIn this regard, experts say that data from the coming years will be crucial in determining whether this improvement represents a sustainable pattern. If the positive trajectory continues, it will reflect the effectiveness of government measures. If not, they argue, there will be a need to re-evaluate the true influence of weather patterns and other contributing factors.\nDespite the encouraging figures, both analysts and environmental specialists agree that Lahore’s air quality, while improved, remains far from safe, underscoring the need for continued vigilance and long-term, sustained interventions.\nCOMMENTS\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ",
