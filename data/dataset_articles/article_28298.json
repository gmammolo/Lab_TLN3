  "text": "Ampere ElectriCity plant in Douai has reached a historic milestone: in 15 months, 100,000 Renault 5 E-Tech electric cars have been assembled here. The jubilee version is the Techno with a 52 kWh battery — the most popular combination of configuration and battery. The car rolled off the assembly line last week.\nWhat is known At the Ampere ElectriCity plant in Douai, six electric models are assembled on the same line: Renault 5, Renault Megane and Renault Scenic E-Tech electric, Alpine A290, Nissan Micra, and Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross. About 900 cars are produced here daily, two-thirds of which are Renault 5 E-Tech electric. For this, production operates in three shifts: morning, day, and, as of October 13, night — with half the productivity compared to day shifts.\nRenault decided to produce most of the electric cars in the Ampere ElectriCity complex, where two-thirds of the suppliers (including the plant in Cleon producing electric motors) are within a 300 km radius, and most buyers are within a 1000 km radius. The complex also includes a plant in Maubeuge, where the Renault 4 E-Tech electric is assembled, and a plant in Ruitz specializing in the production of gears for hybrid and electric transmissions, as well as battery cases through the joint venture Minth Electricity Technology.",
