  "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Volkswagen issued a recall for over 40,000 Audi vehicles due to a software glitch that could have potentially dangerous consequences.\nVolkswagen issued a voluntary recall for 14 Audi models due to a software glitch caused by a flex-foil cable that could cause the vehicles' instrument panels to shut off entirely, meaning the driver could not see their speed, errors in the car, and other key information.\nThe company issued the recall after receiving 2,285 complaints prior to March 24, but none resulted in crashes or injuries.\nThe affected cars were all Audis from 2021 and consisted of the following models:\nCustomers who own one of the affected vehicles will be notified by letters mailed by March 30, 2025, and may bring their vehicles to participating dealers to replace the instrument panel module software free of charge.\nMore information can be found on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website.",
