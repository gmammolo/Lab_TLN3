  "title": "Auchan Romania contributes to accelerating the agri-food chain transition through Climate Supplier Event - Business Review",
  "text": "In a context where agri-food systems are responsible for almost one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, Auchan Romania is taking an active role in transitioning its supply chain towards a more sustainable model. At the second edition of the Climate Supplier Event, organised under the auspices of the Climate Change Summit, the company brought together over 100 producers and suppliers to begin measuring emissions and to intensify actions towards decarbonisation, increasing their resilience and competitiveness. We speak with Corina Dospinoiu-Imre, Sustainability Director at Auchan Romania, about the importance of this initiative, the concrete steps taken, and what a future-ready food chain entails.\nWhat motivated you to organise a new edition of the Climate Supplier Event, and what were the main objectives of this meeting?\nWe felt it was the right time to accelerate collaboration with our suppliers. The main objective of this edition was to create a framework for dialogue to discover opportunities for business process efficiency, what we stand to gain from an economic perspective, and to jointly understand how to measure the carbon footprint, what the reduction levers are, and to support our partners in adopting sustainable practices through education and financing programmes. By bringing together over 100 suppliers at the Climate Supplier Event, we aim to generate a transformation at the supply chain level, which will result in a quantifiable reduction of carbon emissions in the near future.\nWhy do you consider this event relevant not only for Auchan’s suppliers but for the entire food industry in Romania?\nA large-scale event such as the Climate Supplier Event is relevant both for Auchan’s suppliers and for the entire food industry in Romania because food chains function as an interconnected system. If only one retailer or a few producers act, the impact remains limited. Agriculture, processing, logistics, packaging – all these elements contribute to the generation of emissions, costs, and competitiveness. That is why our event is about how the entire sector can become more efficient, more sustainable, and more resilient in the face of climate change.\nHow does Auchan support local suppliers in the transition process towards more sustainable business models?\nWe have launched the Partners for Decarbonisation programme in which we collaborate directly with suppliers to measure their emissions and develop reduction plans. Also, to support Auchan’s suppliers, and for the first time, through the partnership with BRD – Groupe Société Générale, the bank offers our suppliers access to an extensive range of sustainable financing options, from which they can choose based on the specifics of their company’s activity. By accessing these instruments, companies can quickly reduce operational costs related to energy, logistics, and resources, and over time strengthen their competitiveness and capacity to manage climate risks. Furthermore, a responsible approach visibly increases their credibility and opens up easier access to financing that requires clear sustainability criteria.\nIn parallel, a workshop was held during the event, through which suppliers chose several optimisation and efficiency levers for their own business, which will result in reduced emissions as well as costs. We aim in the immediate future to enter into contractual commitments with our suppliers regarding emissions measurement, the creation of decarbonisation plans, and the constant tracking of progress. A key goal for us remains to continue finding solutions to support our suppliers in this endeavour.\nWhy do you say that decarbonisation is not just an environmental issue, but also one of economic competitiveness?\nReducing emissions is not just an expense, but also a tool for increasing efficiency. For example, optimising the logistics chain, reducing food waste, or improving energy efficiency and packaging reduction directly translate into lower costs, which leads to better profitability, and the effect of these measures also impacts the reduction of carbon emissions. Thus, decarbonisation becomes a growth driver and not just an environmental obligation.\nHow can Romanian farmers and processors turn sustainability into a real market advantage?\nSustainability becomes a real competitive advantage for Romanian farmers and processors through rigorous resource optimisation, which leads to a significant reduction in operational costs. Adopting practices such as precision agriculture, which optimises the use of water, fertilisers, and pesticides, and integrating renewable energy (e.g., solar, biomass) into farms and processing units, minimises the carbon footprint and expenditure. Efficient water and waste management also contributes to diminished long-term costs, transforming investments in sustainability into substantial savings.\nMoreover, applying the principles of the circular economy allows for the smart valorisation of agricultural by-products and processing waste. These can be turned into new revenue streams, such as compost or biogas, while simultaneously reducing disposal costs. This approach not only reduces waste but also creates opportunities for market differentiation, adding value to the entire production cycle and responding to the growing demand for responsible products and processes.\nThese sustainability efforts also open up access to crucial strategic financing. Companies with a solid sustainability profile, which integrate ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria, become attractive from an investment perspective. Thus, they benefit from easier access to European funds and bank financing under better conditions than companies that do not prioritise sustainability.\nIn your vision, what does a future-ready food chain mean?\nFor us, a future-ready food chain is one where every link – from farmer, processor, retailer, to logistics – adopts clear sustainability goals, uses technology and data to improve performance, and creates value together for the final consumer. In essence, we want to create a strong ecosystem that mitigates its risks, whether they are climate risks, risks concerning current and potential high costs for energy or raw materials, by transforming business models.\nI wish for us all a chain where we reduce waste and excessive energy consumption, optimise transport, and where quality and resilience become a standard. Thus, we will be prepared not only for climate challenges but also for the demands of consumers and the global market.\nThrough projects such as the Climate Supplier Event and dedicated partnerships, Auchan Romania encourages the integration of sustainability principles across the entire supply chain, as part of a joint effort for a responsible transition. In this sense, the company reaffirms its ambition to build a Romanian model of responsible supply, capable of generating a beneficial impact on nature and communities, while also supporting economic growth.",
