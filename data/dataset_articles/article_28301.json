  "text": "Specializing in clean energy technology, Lorean Diaz is a visionary, resilient, and strategic CEO, as well as a foresighted and analytical leader, whose work is centered on waste-to-energy infrastructure investment. A world-class civil engineer and innovator, Diaz recognizes waste management as one of the largest challenges local and national governments face today. Through his company, Blue Steel Group, he aims to convert municipal solid waste to electricity at scale.\nBefore beginning his professional career, Diaz pursued an education. He first earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering in Colombia, then moved to Canada to complete a Master of Science in construction project management. During this time, he studied how to turn waste into electricity and clean fuels using clean technologies, took financial courses, and attended numerous energy seminars.\nHaving completed his studies in Canada, Diaz returned to Venezuela and joined some of the largest national and international oil companies in the country. Leveraging his education, he soon found himself leading multidisciplinary teams responsible for building significant oil, gas, and electricity projects across Venezuela and South America. As he furthered his expertise, however, he was confronted with the gap between technical execution and financial structuring.\nThis recognition pushed Diaz to deepen his education in finance, placing special emphasis on investment banking. With this newfound knowledge, he was soon appointed general director of the National Treasury Office of Venezuela, where he managed the country’s foreign debt portfolio of approximately $160 billion for five years. For this, he was recognized by the Inter-American Development Bank as the best manager of external debt in Venezuela in the last 20 years.\nNow boasting a valuable combination of engineering and financial mastery, Diaz returned to his interest in clean energy. To this end, he founded Blue Steel Group in the United States to build the technologies necessary to tackle global waste and energy challenges by generating green hydrogen from waste, as well as facilitating biodiesel and methanol production.\nBlue Steel Group has recently received several letters of interest from major hedge funds in the Emirates, including Dubai and Qatar, as well as from Singapore, all expressing readiness to move forward with substantial investments. These commitments signal international confidence in the company’s mission and underscore how Blue Steel Group is attracting overseas capital into the United States.\nThrough Blue Steel Group, Diaz is designing and implementing mega plants through impact investing, transforming municipal solid waste into electricity and clean fuels. In Ecuador, these facilities are projected to be the largest waste-to-energy plants in Latin America. They will also address significant electricity deficits, including a 2.5-gigawatt-per-hour shortfall in the country; Blue Steel Group plants are expected to generate approximately 1.5 gigawatts per hour.\nAs part of this process, the company will also produce ammonia and urea as byproducts of organic-waste gasification. Because the process is highly automated and relies on low-cost labor in regions such as Africa and Ecuador, Blue Steel Group can produce these materials at significantly lower cost. All ammonia and urea generated, key components in global fertilizers, will be sold at competitive prices, about 35% below standard market rates, exclusively to major U.S. fertilizer companies. This strategy is positioned to reduce food production expenses in the United States and provide substantial economic savings nationwide.\nToday, Diaz has begun the process of expansion into Africa. Blue Steel aims to become a leading company in waste-to-energy technology across the African continent, advancing projects that combine energy production with sustainable waste management. Leveraging his dual experience in engineering and sovereign finance, Diaz is uniquely capable of structuring bankable projects for hedge funds, private equity, and family offices, marrying infrastructure impact with profitability for Blue Steel Group investors.\nIn addition to its projects in Latin America and Africa, Blue Steel Group is preparing to build large-scale waste-to-energy mega plants in Central America and several Caribbean nations. These facilities will expand the company’s global clean-energy footprint and support long-term regional sustainability efforts.\nAs an EB1 extraordinary ability engineer in the United States, Diaz is employing his expertise to create energy-deficient solutions in Latin America and Africa. Moving forward, he aims to build at least six waste-to-energy mega plants in Latin America and ten in Africa, creating a network of facilities that eliminate the need for landfills, close energy gaps, and support key U.S. industries through affordable fertilizer inputs derived from waste-to-energy processes. With new investment interest from hedge funds abroad and expansion plans into Central America and the Caribbean, Diaz continues to advance as a visionary, strategic, and foresighted CEO shaping clean-energy development on a global scale.",
