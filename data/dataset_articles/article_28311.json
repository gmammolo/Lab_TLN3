  "text": "SSE plc -0.75% National Grid plc -0.09% By Joshua Kirby\nU.K. energy-markets regulator Ofgem approved 28 billion pounds ($37.39 billion) in funding for the country's grid via a price-control framework, a move it says will lessen volatility in customers' power bills.\n\"Energy network companies have been given the green light for multibillion-pound funding to strengthen the stability, security and resilience of our energy networks,\" Ofgem said Thursday.\nClose to 18 billion pounds of the funding will go to maintaining Britain's gas networks, Ofgem said.\n\"This essential investment ensures a safe and reliable energy system for years to come,\" the regulator said.\nThe remaining roughly 10 billion pounds will go to strengthening the electricity transmission network, Ofgem said.\nExpansion of the grid will reduce household energy bills, Ofgem said, pointing to \"?lower reliance?on imported gas and?the?halting of constraint costs ensuring power?flows efficiently ?from where it's?generated?to where?it's needed, even at peak demand.\"\nEnergy-infrastructure operator National Grid welcomed the announcement.\n\"We welcome Ofgem's recognition of the need for significant investment into the electricity transmission sector to continue to deliver world-leading reliability whilst nearly doubling the amount of power we can transfer around the country,\" National Grid said.\nEnergy company SSE said the investment would help reduce reliance on imported energy. The move will \"remove grid bottlenecks and strengthen energy security, as well as acting as a major catalyst for economic growth, jobs and supply-chain investments across the U.K.,\" SSE said.\nWrite to Joshua Kirby at joshua.kirby@wsj.com; @joshualeokirby\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-04-25 0253ET\n© Dow Jones - 2025",
