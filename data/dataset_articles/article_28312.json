  "text": "RENOVERTY unveils policy package to place rural well being at the heart of EU renovation\nRenovate Europe Day 2025: key actions for sustainable and affordable buildings\nRenovate Europe Day 2025: key actions for sustainable and affordable buildings\nREDay2025 in Copenhagen marked a milestone for energy renovation in Europe: over 70 organisations signed the Copenhagen Commitment and discussed solutions to accelerate the delivery of efficient and affordable buildings. Access the full session via the link.\nRenovate Europe Day 2025 (REDay2025) took place on 3 November in Copenhagen, bringing together industry leaders, policymakers, and experts to discuss how to accelerate the energy renovation of buildings across Europe. The event, organised by the Renovate Europe campaign in partnership with SYNERGI, highlighted the importance of efficiency and affordability in the energy transition.\nOne of the key milestones was the presentation of the Copenhagen Commitment, signed by more than 70 organisations from the energy efficiency and construction sectors. This pledge aims to drive technologies, investments, and skills that enable more sustainable and resilient buildings, supported by stable regulatory frameworks. It was emphasised that the European Commission will present a new post-2030 energy efficiency framework in 2026, which will be crucial for providing predictability to the industry.\nThe day featured discussions on affordable housing, financing, Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) implementation, and the renovation of non-residential buildings. Challenges and opportunities to close the investment gap and accelerate deep renovation of the building stock were also addressed. The event concluded with visits to exemplary projects, showcasing how renovation improves comfort, reduces energy consumption, and strengthens Europe’s competitiveness.\nThe official link provides access to the full session and event materials.",
