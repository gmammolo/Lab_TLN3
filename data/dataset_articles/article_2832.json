Between March 31 and April 3, the two exchanged messages in which Diiorio allegedly offered him money to kill her ex-boyfriend and his daughter.\nOnce the man informed police of the alleged plot, investigators interviewed the Philadelphia officer who was reportedly the intended target. He confirmed Diiorio was his ex-girlfriend and that the two had ended their relationship on March 6.\nThe Philly officer told investigators that his home was “vandalized by a Molotov cocktail in September 22.” Diiorio had also filed a temporary restraining order against him during the summer of 2024, but it was later dropped.\nDiiorio and the man from Tinder then met on April 4 in Gloucester Township, where she provided the man with $500 in cash upfront in exchange for the killings, according to court documents.\nADVERTISEMENT Once the money was exchanged, Diiorio was taken into custody by Gloucester Township Police.\nDiiorio was placed into custody at the Camden County Correctional Facility. It was not immediately clear if she had posted bail.\nA detention hearing is set to occur on Wednesday.",
