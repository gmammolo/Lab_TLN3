  "text": "For all the years of hydrological studies and analysis of water supply, it sometimes feels like we are still in a world of magical thinking as described by John Steinbeck in the 1952 novel East of Eden.\n“There would be five or six wet and wonderful years,” Steinbeck wrote. “And then the dry years would come… Then the farmers and the ranchers would be filled with disgust for the Salinas Valley… And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.”\nAt long last, maybe it is not going to always be this way.\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 9, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors is set to vote on adopting a monitoring plan for the deep aquifers, still somewhat unknown reservoirs located 500 to 900 feet underground that are tapped with wells to supply water for household, agricultural and industrial use.\nIn tandem, the board is set to consider signing a memorandum of understanding that acknowledges five different agencies are responsible for monitoring the groundwater basin and they should collaborate on data sharing and standardization. (Those agencies are quite the alphabet soup of water bureaucracy: Monterey County Water Resources Agency, Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency, Marina Coast Water District Groundwater Sustainability Agency, Monterey Peninsula Water Management District and Seaside Groundwater Basin Watermaster.)\nThis degree of collaboration – left vague in the MOU, describing that all parties “agree to cooperate” – might seem mundane, but it’s a significant step forward in groundwater management progress.\nThe idea of teamwork instead of territorial water wars is something of a novelty. The premise is that sharing data can help all of the agencies arrive at a shared understanding of groundwater resources, instead of fighting over whose hydrologist produced a more credible report than another. (For a counterpoint, the my-hydrologist-is-better-than-your-hydrologist kind of argument is the subject of a lawsuit now at trial concerning a proposed desalination plant in Marina.)\nThe Monterey County Water Resources Agency’s board of directors voted unanimously to recommend approval of the MOU, and that recommendation now heads to the County Board of Supervisors; the other agencies are working toward formal adoption by January.\n“We intend to work together.”\nIn describing the intent of the agreement to the MCWRA board on Nov. 17, General Manager Ara Azhderian explained the importance of working together for the deep aquifer monitoring study to succeed. “There are five management entities involved and all depend on each other for that data, so we can properly manage what is a shared resource,” he said. “We intend to work together to stand this program up and make it a success.”\nThe monitoring study lays out a plan for these agencies to collect data on various subbasins. “The political boundaries and the hydrologic boundaries don’t line up in most cases,” Azhderian says.\nIn short, the plan calls for monitoring extraction data on an annual basis; groundwater elevation at least quarterly; and groundwater quality at least annually.\nThe data, to be collected from dozens of wells, is critical to help advance a better understanding of the underground water resources that not only make the region habitable, but irrigate crops that feed the world. And these resources play an increasingly prominent role.\n“As seawater intrusion has impacted the 180- and 400-foot aquifers in the coastal region of the Salinas Valley, landowners and water suppliers have turned to the deep aquifers as an alternative source for groundwater supply,” the monitoring plan reads.\nOf course, even a friendly MOU can’t forestall whatever action might eventually be taken. Mike Scattini, a grower and member of the MCWRA board of directors, expressed doubts in the discussion on Nov. 17. “My concern is… we are doing this and it could be utilized for – I’ll put it nicely, management – restrictions on pumping, restrictions on well drilling.”\nWhat comes down the road to protect water resources may be less friendly terrain, but cooperation is a good starting point.",
