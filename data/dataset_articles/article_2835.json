  "text": "Manlius, N.Y. — A man shot his own nephew in a fatal shooting in the village of Manlius this weekend, police said Wednesday.\nPolice are still looking for the uncle, Radu Turner, 48, of Manlius. He’s wanted in the killing of Kenquan Davis, 39, of Syracuse.\nOn Wednesday, Manlius police announced they have obtained an arrest warrant for Turner for second-degree murder and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon.\nPolice also made public that the two men were related.\nAt about 4 p.m. Sunday, Turner was involved in a verbal altercation with Davis in front of Turner’s home at 205 Elmbrook Drive.\nAs the argument escalated, Davis attempted to drive away in a car when he was shot, causing him to crash into a nearby tree on Garrett Drive, said Manlius Police Capt. Tina Stanton\nTurner is described by police as 6 feet tall and between 160 and 180 pounds.\nTurner was last seen driving a gray Jeep Grand Cherokee with the New York license plate LHX-5697. On Monday night, the same Jeep was found in front of a Salina apartment complex, Harborside Manor at 24 Town Garden Drive.\nTurner has done two stints in state prison, court records show.\nHe pleaded guilty in 2001 to a drug charge and was sentenced to two to four years in prison. He pleaded guilty in 2017 to a pair of weapons and drug charges and was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.\nPolice ask anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Turner not to approach him but instead to call 911.\nSyracuse.com staff writer Timia Cobb covers breaking news.
