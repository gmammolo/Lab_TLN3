  "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas — The Fort Worth Zoo is incredibly proud to host conservationists, scientists, and elephant specialists from 21 countries for a weeklong exchange on the latest research and developments in elephant conservation, affecting both wild elephants and those in managed care. Attendees of the International Elephant Foundation (IEF) conference will convene at the Fort Worth Zoo beginning today through Dec. 8 for its biannual conservation and research symposium — the first time in more than a decade that this meeting is held in the U.S. Session topics will include emerging anti-poaching technologies, new tools for human-elephant conflict mitigation, breakthroughs in reproduction and vaccine research, and conservation medicine, among others.\nFollowing the symposium, the Global Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus (EEHV) Summit will take place on Zoo grounds from Dec. 9 to 10. EEHV is the deadliest virus to Asian and African elephants, affecting both those in the wild and managed care all over the world. This summit will allow another opportunity for leaders in the field to discuss the latest research and applied conservation science, explore new techniques and ultimately strengthen our shared commitment to safeguarding this species.\n“It’s an incredible honor to host global leaders in elephant conservation — professionals with boots on the ground across range countries, working tirelessly to protect and manage elephant populations,” said Fort Worth Zoo Executive Director and current IEF President Michael Fouraker. “This symposium is not only an opportunity to learn from leading experts, exchange ideas, and build stronger partnerships across the conservation community; it is also a chance to spotlight the Fort Worth Zoo’s premier elephant program and the exceptional team behind it, whose breeding successes and advancements in conservation medicine are making meaningful contributions to the future of the species.”\nIn 1998, the Fort Worth Zoo spearheaded the development of the International Elephant Foundation (IEF), a global conservation organization dedicated to saving elephant species worldwide. Nearly 30 years later, this independent nonprofit organization supports and operates elephant conservation and education projects in managed facilities and in the wild, with an emphasis on management, protection and scientific research.\nIEF Symposium Schedule:\nDec. 3-4 IEF Board Meeting\nDec. 5-8 IEF Symposium\nDec. 9-10 EEHV Summit\nMembers of the media are invited to participate in program sessions. Email the Zoo’s communications director, Avery Elander ( aelander@fortworthzoo.org ), to coordinate.\nThe nationally acclaimed Fort Worth Zoo has been voted a top zoo in North America by USA Today, one of the “World’s Greatest” by BloombergTV, the Best Zoo in Texas by Yahoo Travel, the No. 5 zoo in the nation by USA Travel Guide, the No. 1 family attraction in the DFW Metroplex by Zagat survey and a Top 10 Zoo or Aquarium by FamilyFun magazine. Home to nearly 7,000 animals, the Zoo is beginning its final installment of a four-phase master plan. The first phase, African Savanna , opened in 2018; the second phase, Elephant Springs , opened in 2021; the third, Predators of Asia & Africa , opened in June 2023. The fourth and final phase, Forests & Jungles of the World , is next. The institution’s focus on education and conservation is second to none, enhancing the lives of more than 1 million visitors a year and the animals that live there.",
