  "text": "DUBLIN — The Dublin San Ramon Services District (DSRSD) recently earned the 2025 Utility of the Future Today award from the Water Environment Federation (WEF) and its national partners for leadership in water reuse.\nWEF is a national organization that honors utilities across the country for advancing sustainability and environmental protection.\nArun Goel, DSRSD board president, told The Independent that the recognition reflects the district’s long-term commitment to collaboration and sustainability.\n“Through strong collaboration with our partners, DSRSD is advancing recycled water initiatives, safeguarding precious drinking water resources and promoting environmental stewardship for a sustainable future,” he said.\n“Every investment DSRSD makes in recycled water demonstrates our leadership in building a reliable, resilient system — working hand-in-hand with regional partners to secure resources and strengthen sustainability for generations to come,” Goel added.\nDSRSD’s program is distinguished by its scale, long-term reliability and measurable environmental benefits. About 25% of the district’s annual water demand is met with recycled water — a contribution that reduces reliance on imported drinking water and boosts drought resilience.\nDuring the summer, the district recycles most wastewater entering its treatment plant, sometimes capturing every available drop on peak days.\nFor more than 30 years, the district has recycled water to conserve drinking supplies and protect the environment.\nDSRSD adopted its first Water Recycling Policy in 1992 and partnered with the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) in 1995 to produce and deliver recycled water through the DSRSD-EBMUD Recycled Water Authority (DERWA).\nSince DERWA began operations in 2006, the program has diverted more than 3,300 tons of nitrogen from San Francisco Bay and processed more than 20 billion gallons of wastewater, helping prevent harmful algal blooms, the district said.\nEngaging the community and building strong partnerships have been central to DSRSD’s success.\nWhile Pleasanton and Livermore operate their own recycled water systems, DERWA works with the cities of Dublin and San Ramon to educate residents, coordinate infrastructure upgrades and promote water reuse across the region.\nThat collaboration was recognized in 2017 when the City of Dublin won WateReuse California’s “Recycled Water Customer of the Year” award after being nominated by DSRSD.\nThe district also focused on public outreach. Early initiatives such as “Puttin’ on the Green” and signage at irrigation sites highlighted the benefits of using recycled water.\nDuring the 2012–2016 drought, DSRSD opened the Bay Area’s first residential recycled water-fill station, allowing residents to collect water for outdoor use. Though the station no longer operates, it played a key role in building public awareness and laying the foundation for DERWA and other regional programs.\nDSRSD said one ongoing challenge is keeping recycled-water programs aligned with changing community needs. As homes become more water-efficient and residents conserve water, less wastewater is available for recycling.\nTo address this, the district has partnered with regional agencies to stretch supplies and plan ahead.\nIn 2021, DSRSD participated in a pilot program to treat wastewater from the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District to meet peak irrigation demand. Officials said the pilot’s success has encouraged similar collaborations to expand recycled water production.\nLooking ahead, DSRSD is exploring ways to stretch its recycled water supplies and secure supplemental sources.\nThese efforts will allow the district and its partners to expand the system and connect with new customers. The district is also working with neighboring water and wastewater agencies on long-term strategies to maximize reuse, improve drought resilience and further reduce nutrient discharges into San Francisco Bay.\nIn 2026, DERWA will celebrate 20 years of delivering recycled water to schools, parks, golf courses and other public spaces.\nThe district has installed advanced meters that track irrigation by the hour and upgraded treatment systems that use 35% less energy.\n“This award recognizes decades of collaboration and innovation,” DSRSD General Manager Jan Lee said in a statement. “Our recycled water program is a model of how local partnerships can strengthen water reliability and sustainability across the region.”\nFounded in 1953, DSRSD serves roughly 194,600 people, providing potable and recycled water to Dublin and San Ramon’s Dougherty Valley, collecting and treating wastewater in Dublin and south San Ramon, and treating wastewater for Pleasanton under contract.\nDSRSD was honored earlier this year at the Water Environment Federation’s annual conference.",
