  "text": "In the 2025 Aquaculture Certification Schemes Benchmark published by the Aquatic Life Institute (ALI), the ASC Farm Standard achieved a score of 7.75 out of 10, matching the score received by the RSPCA. The highest-rated scheme was Certified Humane, with a score of 8.75.\n“We thank the ALI for recognising ASC Farm Standard’s robust management structure and its clear commitment to continuous improvement, transparency, and strong scientific foundations in improving aquatic animal welfare. We value the discussion and dialogue encouraged by the benchmark and appreciate the constructive engagement it fosters across the sector,” said ASC standards manager for animal health and welfare, Maria Filipa Castanheira, in a press release.\nWith a score of 7.75 out of 10, the ALI Benchmark found the ASC Farm Standard demonstrates a technically mature, welfare-conscious and continuously evolving framework. ASC remains the leading reference for measurable and evidence-based aquatic animal welfare standards worldwide among major aquaculture organisations.\n“As we refined this year’s Benchmark, our exchanges with ASC’s technical team were consistently constructive and rooted in a shared commitment to advancing aquatic animal welfare,” said Steffan Edward, certification specialist at the ALI. “The ASC Farm Standard stands out as a rigorous and evolving framework, and Aquatic Life Institute's assessment focuses solely on the welfare dimensions of that framework, without incorporating the broader social, environmental, or accountability components that also define ASC’s holistic approach.”\nThe score of 7.75 does not reflect the assurance component of ASC’s certification, as this element is currently excluded from the benchmark criteria. However, although not factored into the scoring framework, transparency and assurance remain central to ASC’s approach to animal welfare.\nThrough ASC’s robust assurance system – including rigorous audits, verification processes, stakeholder consultation and public reporting – ASC provides clear, demonstrable proof that welfare requirements are not only defined but consistently implemented in practice. This integrated model ensures our standards deliver credible, accountable, and tangible improvements for aquatic animal welfare.\nASC recognises the important role of benchmarks in driving higher sector-wide standards and welcome ongoing engagement to ensure they accurately reflect both written requirements and the systems that deliver meaningful welfare outcomes in practice.",
