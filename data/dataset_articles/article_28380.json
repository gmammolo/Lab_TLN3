  "text": "Community Corner\nNicor Gas Foundation pledges $100,000 to The Conservation Foundation\nThis pledge supports vital restoration and educational initiatives that benefit both the environment and the residents of Northern Illinois.\nThis is a paid post contributed by a Patch Community Partner. The views expressed in this post are the author's own, and the information presented has not been verified by Patch.\nDec. 1, 2025 - The Nicor Gas Foundation is making a $100,000 pledge to The Conservation Foundation, reinforcing its long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship and community well-being. This donation will accelerate the restoration of Belrose Farm in LaSalle County and expand two signature programs that connect people and children to nature: Nature Rx and Mighty Acorns.\nBelrose Farm, an 183-acre property along the Illinois River, faces significant ecological challenges from invasive species such as Reed Canary Grass and Common Reed, which dominate 33 acres of its floodplain and wetlands. The Nicor Gas Foundation’s funding will enable GIS mapping, herbicide application, prescribed burns and monitoring treatments to restore native plant diversity and prepare the land for prairie and wetland species.\n“As part of our ongoing commitment to create, maintain and sustain 10,000 acres of open space within our service area, we are proud to deepen our collaboration with The Conservation Foundation,” said Wendell Dallas, president and CEO of Nicor Gas, which is affiliated with the Nicor Gas Foundation. “This pledge supports vital restoration and educational initiatives that benefit both the environment and the residents of Northern Illinois.”\nFor 25 years, Nicor Gas and the Nicor Gas Foundation have been champions of The Conservation Foundation, providing volunteer support and critical resources. Nicor Gas employees have helped with conservation activities such as the DuPage River Sweep and invasive species clearing at Belrose Farm, and the company and the foundation have donated more than $160,000 to assist the nonprofit in its efforts.\n“The support of organizations with a shared commitment to the environment is what helps us carry out our mission to improve the health of our communities by preserving and restoring open space and natural lands,” said Brook McDonald, president and CEO of The Conservation Foundation. “With assistance from more than 5,000 members and 500 volunteers, like employees from Nicor Gas, we have helped preserve over 35,000 acres of open space.”\nTo learn more about Nicor Gas and its commitment to the environment through charitable giving, visit www.nicorgas.com/2024-impact-report.html.\nThis post is an advertorial piece contributed by a Patch Community Partner, a local brand partner.
