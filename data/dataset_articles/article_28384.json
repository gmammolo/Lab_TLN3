  "text": "By Graeme Wearden ,\n45 minutes ago Ofgem says £28bn investment will maintain a safe, secure and resilient energy grid and to upgrade and expand capacity to meet growing demands Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA 8.05am GMT\nSmaller business will see an increase in network charges under Ofgem’s plans.\nThe regulator says that by 2031, indicative network charge increases range from around £60 a year for a small holiday let or retail kiosk to £1,700 for small offices or hotels and £9,760 for a medium factory.\n8.02am GMT\nNational Gas , who run Britain’s gas network, have crunched today’s pricing decision from Ofgem , and worked out they have been given a “baseline funding level” of £3.2bn.\nThat’s up from the draft determination of £2.46bn made in the summer.\nNational Gas chief executive, Jon Butterworth, said :\n“This funding outcome confirms the critical role that the gas transmission system plays in Britain’s energy security now and for decades to come. For just 3p per day, less than 0.5% of the average consumer dual-fuel bill, Britain’s national gas transmission system continues to deliver excellent value for money for consumers – keeping our lights on, industries powered and homes warm.\n“Over the past few months, our teams have worked extensively and constructively with Ofgem to provide additional evidence on the case for further investment in Britain’s national gas network to safeguard our country’s energy security and deliver benefits for consumers.\n“In the coming weeks, we will undertake a more detailed review of Ofgem’s decision to ensure it enables us to deliver a safe, resilient network that secures Britain’s energy, maintains our industrial competitiveness and supports the country’s clean energy ambitions.”\n7.40am GMT\nGreenpeace is urging Ofgem to ensure energy customers are not hit with unnecessary bill increases .\nGreenpeace UK’s senior climate advisor, Charlie Kronick , said:\n“Britain’s energy grid is no longer fit for purpose. And without vital upgrades now our electricity system risks suffering a similar fate as our water network – much higher costs and underperformance further down the line.\n“This money must be spent effectively, however, with robust safeguards and strong regulation to protect bill-payers, and ensure these upgrades deliver genuine value for money, offering fair but not excessive returns. We hope Ofgem have, and will continue to, strain every sinew in ensuring that new technologies of storage and flexible demand are adopted to minimise costly upgrades.\n“Energy costs are a major pressure on households and businesses and, as we move to a cleaner energy system, prices must eventually come down. The government should be prepared to step in to ensure our energy system works for billpayers, not profits.”\n7.34am GMT\nDESNZ: essential to upgrade gas and electricity networks The UK government has welcomed Ofgem’s decision to approve £28bn of new investment in the energy grid.\nIt says the spending is vital, after years of underinvestment in the energy system.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said:\n“This government is taking action to bring down energy bills for families, with the Budget taking an average £150 of costs off bills in April, and expanding our £150 Warm Home Discount to over six million families.\n“Upgrading our gas and electricity networks after years of underinvestment is essential to keep the lights on and ensure energy security for our country. Without these plans, which were first set out under the previous government, costs would spiral and our security would be compromised.\n“The only way to bring down bills for good and get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster is with this government’s mission to deliver clean homegrown [energy] that we control.”\n7.30am GMT\nIntroduction: £28bn energy upgrade gets green light Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\nPlans to spend £28bn to upgrade Great Britain’s electricity grid have been signed off, in a move that should improve the energy networks, speed the transition to new forms of energy…and increase household bills.\nEnergy regulator Ofgem has just announced that energy companies have been given approval to “strengthen the stability, security and resilience of our energy networks”. by upgrading the energy grid.\nThe majority of the spending – £17.8bn - announced today is to maintain Britain’s gas networks.\nThere’s also £10.3bn to improve the nation’s high-voltage electricity network – the biggest expansion of the grid since the 1960s.\nIn total, it’s around £24bn more than was provisionally signed off in the summer .\nOfgem says the investment is the most cost-effective way to harness clean power, support economic growth and protect the country from a repeat of the 2022 gas price shock.\nCustomers will see the impact on their bills, which will rise to cover the cost of the investment. The regulator says £108 will be added to bills per year by 2031; £48 for gas and £60 for electricity.\nBut it claims, the investing will actually save customers £80 each compared to a word where the grid is not expanded.\nSo overall, the net increase in bills to cover all costs by 2031 works out at £30.\nJonathan Brearley, Ofgem CEO, insists the regulator isn’t allowing “investment at any price”, adding:\nEvery pound must deliver value for consumers.\nOfgem will hold network companies accountable for delivering on time and on budget, and we make no apologies for the efficiency challenge we’re setting as the industry scales up investment.\nWe’ve built strong consumer protections into these contracts, meaning funds will only be released when needed and clawed back if not used. Households and businesses must get value for money, and we will ensure they do.”\nThe agenda 9am GMT: UK new car sales data for November\n9.30am GMT: UK construction PMI report for November\n10am GMT: Eurozone retail sales for October\n12.30pm GMT: Challenger US job cuts report\n1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless claims 1.30pm\nUpdated at 8.09am GMT",
