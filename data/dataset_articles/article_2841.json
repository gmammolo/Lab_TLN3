  "text": "A West Australian man is expected to appear before Geraldton Magistrates Court today (10 April, 2025) charged with allegedly soliciting, possessing and transmitting child abuse material, including videos depicting children being sexually abused.\nThe Western Australia Joint Anti Child Exploitation Team (WA JACET), with support from Australian Border Force and the Western Australia Police Force, charged the man, 36, after officers executed a search warrant at his home in WA's Mid-West on Tuesday (8 April, 2025).\nThe search warrant was part of an investigation into a report from the United States' National Center for Missing Exploited Children (NCMEC) about an online user allegedly uploading child abuse material.\nThe man appeared in Geraldton Magistrates Court that day (8 April, 2025) and was refused bail to reappear today (10 April, 2025).\nDuring the search at his home, police seized a computer which they will allege the man used to engage in online chats to procure, transmit and possess child abuse material.\nThe man was charged with nine offences:\nThree counts of transmit child abuse material using a carriage service, contrary to subsection 474.22(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code (Cth);\nThree counts of caused child abuse material to be transmitted to himself using a carriage service, contrary to subsection 474.22(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code (Cth);\nTwo counts of solicit child abuse material using a carriage service, contrary to section 474.22(1)(a)(iv) of the Criminal Code (Cth); and\nOne count of possess child abuse material obtained or accessed using a carriage service, contrary to section 474.22A(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).\nThe maximum penalty for each offence is 15 years' imprisonment.\nAFP Inspector Shona Davis said any involvement in the exploitation or abuse of children was deplorable.\n\"Children are harmed each time images or videos of their exploitation or abuse is viewed or shared,\" Insp Davis said.\n\"Our message to online offenders is clear - if you procure, transmit or possess child abuse material, you will be found and prosecuted.\"\nThe AFP and its partners are committed to stopping child exploitation and abuse, with the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation (ACCCE) driving a collaborative national approach.\nThe ACCCE brings together specialist expertise and skills in a central hub, supporting investigations into online child sexual exploitation and developing prevention strategies focused on creating a safer online environment.\nMembers of the public who have information about people involved in child abuse are urged to contact the ACCCE. If you know abuse is happening right now, or a child is at risk, call police immediately on 000.\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by child sexual abuse and online exploitation, support services are available.\nAdvice and support for parents and carers about how they can help protect children online can be found at the ThinkUKnow website, an AFP-led education program designed to prevent online child sexual exploitation.\nhere.",
