  "text": "The Punjab government has introduced a new initiative under the CM Punjab Green Credit Program that allows households to earn green credits by installing approved solar devices at home.\nThe program encourages residents to shift toward cleaner energy options such as solar panels, solar geysers, solar stoves, and energy-efficient fans. According to the government, one verified installation earns one green credit, and each green credit carries a value of Rs. 10,000.\nApplicants must upload proof of purchase and their utility bill reference number through the MRV form available on the official CMPGCP web portal. Only registered applicants will be eligible for verification and issuance of credits.\nThe program aims to promote low-carbon household energy use and support Punjab’s broader climate and environmental goals. Officials say the initiative is open to the public and encourages residents to participate by installing solar-powered devices and submitting valid documentation online for verification.\nRegistration is available at: https://greencredit.punjab.gov.pk/register.php?_t=1747285752",
