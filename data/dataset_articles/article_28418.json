  "text": "By Alyssa Ochs ,\n1 hours ago\nOne of the best ways to learn more about solar energy and immerse yourself in the clean-energy community is to follow Reddit forums such as r/SolarDIY . In these subreddits, you can get tips for setting up your own solar installation or get inspired to switch to solar for the first time.\nFor example, one post shared updated photos of a homeowner's 40-kilowatt project.\nPhoto Credit: Reddit Photo Credit: Reddit \"Got my 4x Hoymiles 9.6kW inverters and 12x Soluna 10KWh batteries installed,\" the original poster wrote in the caption. \"Still have to run some wires, but I'm flipping tired. I'm the crazy guy from last week with 100x panels in his backyard.\"\nThe post is inspiring because it shows people how they can create their own massive energy-generating setup at home. Although most homeowners don't need a solar system quite this big to power their lights, appliances, and electronics, it's an excellent example of what is possible if you dream big.\nWhen you're ready to go solar, TCD's Solar Explorer can help you get started.\nIn our Solar Explorer , you can connect with partners like Palmetto that offer $0-down solar panel leasing subscription programs. Palmetto also has a mobile app to help you save thousands on home upgrades while making simple changes in your daily life.\nEnergySage , another of our partners, helps homeowners find competitive solar installation bids and all available incentives to save money. EnergySage is an excellent resource for general information on buying solar panels and finding trusted local installers.\nMeanwhile, you can learn about everything from solar system planning to tax credits, troubleshooting tips, and firsthand experiences on the r/SolarDIY and r/solar subreddits.\nIn response to the OP's post about the 40kW project, one Reddit user commented : \"Awesome setup!\"\nWhat's your biggest motivation for converting to electric appliances?\nSaving money\nModernizing my home\nMaking my family safer\nI don't want to convert\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\"Honestly, I think our 'grid' needs to be made up for smaller grids where everyone has solar and a 'large' install on a dedicated space for the neighborhood like this to cap it off,\" another commenter wrote .\n\"Ugh, makes me wish I got into this when I had property!\" someone else added .\n\"Nice. Looks like a mini power station,\" a fourth wrote .\nOnce you have your solar system up and working, you can save even more on monthly utility bills by using it to power energy-efficient appliances, such as a new HVAC system. Our HVAC Explorer can help you find an affordable system and save up to 50% on household heating and cooling costs.\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club .\nHomeowner reveals the off-grid setup that generates nearly 200% of his electricity use: 'Looks like a mini power station' first appeared on The Cool Down .\n1",
