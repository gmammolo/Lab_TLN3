Over 20 weeks, 25 future leaders, drawn from 11 countries, were paired with leading experts and senior executives from a range of organizations to build skills, set professional goals and drive meaningful impact.\nThe program united mentors from 14 different organizations, including government entities, international companies and universities, with mentees to deepen their understanding of sustainability challenges and opportunities, while strengthening their ability to lead change in their own communities. Through one-on-one sessions, each mentor-mentee pair met regularly to exchange insights, develop professional roadmaps, and strengthen leadership capabilities across areas such as innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainability strategy.\nDr. Lamya Fawwaz, Executive Director of Brand & Strategic Initiatives at Masdar, said: “Our priority is to prepare future leaders who can operate with clarity and purpose.
