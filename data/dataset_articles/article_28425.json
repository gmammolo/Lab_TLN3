  "text": "eThekwini vows improved water supply for Ntuzuma, Inanda before Christmas\nUpdated | By Tsakane Mhlongo\neThekwini Municipality says residents in Ntuzuma, Inanda and parts of KwaMashu can expect improved water supply before Christmas.\nThe municipality unveiled an upgraded pump station in Ntuzuma on Wednesday.\nThe city said that the pump station was not operating at full capacity as the pumps had reached the end of their design life.\nThe situation was exacerbated by a fire in 2023, which caused significant damage.\nMayor Cyril Xaba said emergency repairs were carried out on a small section, while the entire facility underwent an upgrade.\nHe believes the improvements will increase performance and reliability.\nALSO READ: Ilembe mayor warns of criminal threats to new KwaDukuza water pipeline\nMeanwhile, Xaba urged the community to safeguard water infrastructure against vandalism.\n\" The repairs and upgrades have really improved the supply of water significantly in this area. We're told that there are 15 pumps that are housed in this station.\n“In addition to that, there are the standby pumps. The standby pumps assist so that if one of the pumps fails, they're able to replace that pump within the shortest possible time.\n“We are assured that what was a problem before has now been overcome, and people can now start to celebrate. They can now receive water that they've not been receiving.\"\nFind us on social media\nFollow the ECR Newswatch WhatsApp channel here\nMORE ON ECR:\nShow's Stories\n-\nKZN coast delivers peak dorado actionKZN coast gears up for exceptional dorado action this weekend.
