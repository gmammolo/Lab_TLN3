  "text": "Microsoft Invests in Pantheon Regeneration to Scale Peatland Restoration for Carbon Removal BOULDER, CO​ – December 3, 2025 – Pantheon Regeneration today announced a significant investment from​ microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, poised to⁢ dramatically accelerate the development and expansion of its pioneering ecological restoration ⁤initiatives.The funding will fuel ⁢Pantheon’s efforts to restore degraded peatlands,unlocking a powerful nature-based solution for carbon dioxide removal.\nPantheon’s‌ flagship project,‍ Pocosin Ecological ‌Reserve I, represents a leading example of commercial peatland restoration in the United States. ⁤These unique ecosystems, holding the largest terrestrial carbon stores on Earth, offer a high-impact pathway to mitigating‍ climate change when revitalized. Pantheon’s methodology focuses on rapid carbon sequestration alongside the crucial‌ regeneration of vital ​wetland habitats.\nDriven by scientific rigor and a collaborative partnership with Duke University, Pantheon develops, owns, and operates peatland restoration projects, ⁣generating ⁤high-quality carbon credits with ‍demonstrable biodiversity⁤ and water quality benefits. The Microsoft investment directly supports Pantheon’s core mission: to restore ⁤ecosystems at‌ scale and deliver carbon credits that meet the growing demands of environmentally conscious corporations.\n“We are excited to partner⁤ with Pantheon ‌Regeneration and support their ⁢innovative approach to carbon ‍removal,” stated Erika Basham, ‍Director of Microsoft’s⁢ Climate Innovation fund, who will join Pantheon’s board as⁣ an observer. “Their commitment to science-backed solutions that deliver both emissions reductions and positive environmental co-benefits aligns perfectly⁢ with our investment ⁢strategy.”\nPantheon’s team uniquely blends expertise in ecology, real asset management, institutional finance, and commodity ‌markets, bridging the⁤ gap between scientific restoration and ‍market viability. This interdisciplinary approach is designed to establish ‌ecosystem restoration⁣ as a compelling investment possibility within⁣ the climate solutions landscape.\n“This investment from Microsoft⁤ is a transformative moment for Pantheon,” said Tripp Wall, CEO of Pantheon Regeneration.”It validates the immense potential of our work to deliver landscape-scale climate solutions and high-quality carbon credits. We ‍are incredibly grateful for⁢ their confidence​ and look forward to scaling ⁤our impact with their support.”\nThe investment‌ reinforces Microsoft’s broader commitment to ​a diversified carbon removal portfolio, encompassing both nature-based and engineered solutions ⁣critical to achieving global climate​ goals.\nSOURCE: Pantheon Regeneration",
