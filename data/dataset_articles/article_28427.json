  "text": "December 4 is celebrated as International Cheetah Day. On this occasion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a moment to celebrate one of the world’s fastest and most extraordinary animals with a detailed post on X. Acknowledging India’s growing success in cheetah conservation, he highlighted the remarkable progress being made in Madhya Pradesh’s sanctuaries and encouraged wildlife lovers across the globe to witness these majestic creatures in their home.\nPM Modi Lauds India’s Efforts On International Cheetah Day\nOn International Cheetah Day, my best wishes to all wildlife lovers and conservationists dedicated to protecting the cheetah, one of our planet’s most remarkable creatures.

He emphasised the ongoing efforts to restore India’s lost ecological heritage, strengthen biodiversity, and create a thriving environment where cheetahs can truly flourish.\nInternational Cheetah Day has been observed every year on December 4 since 2010. The day honours Khayam, a cheetah raised by Dr Laurie Marker, founder of the Cheetah Conservation Fund. The day aims to raise awareness about the world’s fastest land animal. It also highlights the threats it faces, and promote global conservation efforts to protect the species from extinction.\nAlso Read: Beyond Tigers: 6 Exotic Animals You Can Spot In Pench National Park, Madhya Pradesh\nKuno National Park & Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary In Madhya Pradesh\nIn his tweet on International Cheetah Day, the PM said, “India is proud to be home to several cheetahs, and a significant number of them are born on Indian soil. Many of them now thrive in the Kuno National Park and the Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary. It is heartening to see cheetah tourism growing in popularity as well. I encourage more wildlife enthusiasts from across the world to visit India and witness the cheetah in all its splendour.”\nCheetahs were declared extinct in India in 1952. However, thanks to ongoing efforts by conservationists and the government, they have made a comeback. Under the cheetah reintroduction project, the animals were brought from Africa and released into protected habitats. Since then, several of these cheetahs have given birth in India.\nNestled in the Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh, the Kuno National Park became the first home for cheetahs in India again in 2022. Spanning 748.76 km², this national park runs along the Kuno River, and has a diverse landscape of forests and grasslands.\nThe Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary is located in the Chenpuriya district of Madhya Pradesh. It was chosen as the second recognised home for cheetahs in India. Spread over an area of 368.62 km², the sanctuary has a specially prepared 8,900-hectare enclosure for cheetahs that were relocated from Kuno.\nAlso Read: Pawesome News!
