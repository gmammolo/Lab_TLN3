  "text": "1 hours ago The City of Tracy, California, has received a $7.14 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration’s Low or No Emission program. The funds will be used to buy seven electric-diesel hybrid buses for the Tracer fixed-route system. Mayor Dan Arriola announced the funding.\nThe total cost of the new buses is about $8.4 million. State and local sources will provide the remaining funds. The new buses will have low-floor access and more wheelchair securements. These features are intended to meet increased demand and improve accessibility. Mayor Arriola also acknowledged support from Congressman Josh Harder’s office in obtaining the grant. The city plans to use these buses as part of its efforts to move toward zero-emission vehicles in the future.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
