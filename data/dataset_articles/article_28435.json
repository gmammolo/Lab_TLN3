  "text": "International Cheetah Day 2025: India's Cheetah Comeback Surprises Experts as Numbers Rise\nIndia's ambitious project to reintroduce cheetahs, which began with 20 African animals in Kuno National Park, is now a remarkable success. The population has grown to 32, with 21 cubs born on Indian soil.\nInternational Cheetah Day 2025\nIndia's dream of bringing back the cheetah, a species that disappeared from the country more than 70 years ago, is finally taking shape. What began as a bold conservation experiment has now turned into a heartening success story filled with new births, healthier populations, and renewed hope for the future of the species.\nAdd Asianet Newsable as a Preferred Source\nA Historic Return to Indian Soil\nThe journey started when 20 African cheetahs were flown into Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh.\nEight came from Namibia in September 2022, followed by twelve more from South Africa in February 2023. Their arrival captured national attention, but it also sparked concerns: Would they adapt? Would they survive?\nThe project was ambitious, and many were unsure whether India's grasslands could once again support this iconic predator.\nFrom Doubts to Confidence\nThree years later, the picture looks very different. As of December 2025, the cheetah population in India has grown to 32, and the most heartwarming part, 21 of them were born right here. The animals are not just adjusting; they're flourishing. This kind of success is rare for any wildlife reintroduction project, making India's progress stand out on the global stage.\nNew Births Spark Fresh Hope\nMuch of the project's success comes from the steady rise in India-born cubs. One recent moment of pride came in November 2025, when Mukhi, an India-born female, gave birth to five healthy cubs.\nFor conservation teams, these births are more than just numbers; they're proof that the cheetahs feel at home again on Indian land.\nA New Chapter for India's Grasslands\nWith growing numbers and natural breeding now underway, the cheetah's comeback is shaping into a hopeful chapter for India's conservation efforts. Experts say this could become a model for global species revival—showing that with patience, science, and international cooperation, even the most challenging environmental dreams can come true.\nStay updated with the Breaking News Today and Latest News from across India and around the world.
