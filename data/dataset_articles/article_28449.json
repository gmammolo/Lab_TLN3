  "text": "December 2nd, 2025 by WCBC Radio\nMaryland ranks among top states for its protections against climate impacts on its health care system, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund. The rankings explore average air quality, greenhouse gas emissions from the health care sector and risks to health care facilities from natural hazards. Sara Collins, with the Commonwealth Fund, says Maryland’s higher ranking comes from its policies geared toward energy efficiency….\n\"So a state’s overall efforts to improve energy efficiency really matters quite a lot. It affects their greenhouse gas emissions, which also affects air quality. So, states like Maryland that rank higher on these measures just have better overall health environments for the people in their states.\"",
