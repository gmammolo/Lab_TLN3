  "text": "Martin Amenaki, Municipal Chief Executive of Ketu North, has said Ghana’s long-term food security and economic independence hinge on reducing the more than US$2 billion spent annually on food imports.\nHe warned that the growing preference for imported rice, poultry, and processed foods often driven by perceptions of prestige continues to undermine demand for high-quality local produce.\nAmenaki made these remarks during the 41st National Farmers’ Day celebration of the Ketu North Municipal Assembly, held at a colourful ceremony at the Dekpor M/A Basic School.\nThe event renewed calls for stronger commitment to local food production under the theme: “Feed Ghana, Eat Ghana, Secure the Future.”\n“This trend discourages investment, lowers farm-gate prices, and weakens our agricultural base,” he said.\n“To change this, we must embrace consumer patriotism backed by policies that guarantee reliable markets for our farmers.”\nHe highlighted key government interventions designed to strengthen food systems, including the Feed Ghana and Feed the Industry initiatives, enhanced local procurement under the School Feeding Programme, institutional farming in senior high schools, rehabilitation of the Weta Irrigation Scheme, expanded mechanisation services, establishment of Farmers’ Service Centres, modernised rice-milling facilities, and the ongoing Nkoko Nketenkete poultry value-chain project.\nAmenaki called on individuals, businesses, and institutions to partner with the Assembly to build a more robust agricultural economy, describing farmers as “the backbone of the municipality whose hard work continues to sustain livelihoods.”\nCedi opens December 1 trading at GH¢11.27 to the dollar\nMunicipal Director of Agriculture, Believer Avenorkadzi, commended farmers for their resilience despite erratic rainfall, high input prices, logistical constraints, and market challenges.\nReflecting on the national theme, he explained: “‘Eat Ghana’ urges us to value local produce.\n‘Feed Ghana’ calls on us to raise production and quality. ‘Secure the Future’ challenges us to build a resilient, technology-driven agricultural system that can support generations to come.”\nAvenorkadzi noted that Ketu North continues to contribute significantly to national food production, with staples such as cassava, rice, maize, vegetables, and legumes sustaining thousands of households.\nLivestock and poultry production also remain vital for youth employment and processing opportunities.\nHe outlined interventions by the Department of Agriculture, including extension services, regular field visits, training on good agronomic practices, fertilizer use, pest management, and post-harvest handling.\nSupport has also included the distribution of 1,400 bags of fertilizer, over 1,000 improved rice seeds, improved cassava planting materials, and various agrochemicals.\nOther initiatives involve partnerships with the West Africa Food System Resilience Programme (FSRP), Financial Inclusion for Last Mile Actors (FILMA), and Hopeline Institute to strengthen agribusiness skills, financial inclusion, and safe agrochemical usage.\nUnder the Feed Ghana Programme, 195 Farmer-Based Organisations have been validated, and 4,451 farmers digitally registered to enhance planning and transparency.\nDespite these gains, Avenorkadzi highlighted challenges such as inadequate extension personnel, limited storage and processing facilities, insufficient mechanisation, flooding in parts of the Weta Irrigation Scheme, and rising input costs.\nHe called for expanded irrigation, improved post-harvest systems, greater youth participation in mechanised farming, and stronger promotion of local food consumption.\nThe celebration concluded with the presentation of awards to distinguished farmers.\nWonder Pomevor was named Overall Best Farmer, receiving a tricycle and cutlasses.\nOther awardees received items including a motorbike, television set, wheelbarrows, Wellington boots, and a knapsack sprayer.\nAll you need to know about Ghana's new vehicle number plates | BizTech:",
