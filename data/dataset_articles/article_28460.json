  "text": "Ingrid, and the SEB Nordic Energy Fund through Locus Energy, have through their collaboration with Göteborg Energi, played an important role in enabling the local flexibility market Effekthandel Väst to double its capacity this year to 70 MW - equivalent to the electricity consumption of a mid-sized Swedish city. This is one of several initiatives through which the companies are helping to make the electricity grid more intelligent, increase the utilisation of existing infrastructure, and create better conditions for local growth and more stable electricity prices.\nBattery storage that relieves the grid in real time\nBy participating in local flexibility markets, Ingrid provides flexible resources to the electricity grid. In practice, flexibility trading means that flexible actors temporarily reduce their electricity consumption, increase their electricity production, or use energy storage to ease the load on the grid.\nEffekthandel Väst is a local flexibility market in which Göteborg Energi Nät acts as the buyer, securing capacity for the region. Ingrid participates with its 24 MW battery in Gothenburg, which the company owns together with Locus Energy. The facility is controlled via Ingrid’s proprietary trading and optimisation platform and can deliver power in real time when the grid is under stress. The result is a more robust power system that enables more connections and reduces the risk of capacity shortages.\nThis year, the available flexibility in Effekthandel Väst has doubled to 70 MW, thanks in part to the collaboration between Ingrid and Effekthandel Väst that began in late summer 2025.\nComments from the parties\n“Local flexibility markets such as Effekthandel Väst are an important part of our work to create an intelligent and future-proof power system. Through our close and valued collaboration with Göteborg Energi, we can strengthen grid resilience, increase security for customers, and improve conditions for businesses. This is a clear example of the kind of innovation and cooperation needed to transform the energy system,” says Nicklas Bäcker, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Ingrid.\n“Thanks to the collaboration with companies such as Ingrid and Locus Energy, who actively help relieve the grid during critical hours, we can connect more new customers to the network without having to wait for grid reinforcements at the national or regional level. In addition, there is a shared learning process and interaction with these types of actors, who already participate in other markets,” says Therese Ceasar, Head of Flexibility at Göteborgs Energi Nät.\n“Our goal is to strengthen local value creation and contribute to a more flexible power system. With our portfolio of hydropower, batteries, and wind power – with most connections located in local grids – Locus Energy can create tangible benefits for grid owners across the country. We are therefore very pleased, together with Ingrid, to support Göteborg Energi in balancing their loads and helping to build a more robust future grid with our batteries,” says Mattias Söderquist, Deputy CEO and Partner at Locus Energy.\nIngrid’s growing presence in western Sweden\nIngrid operates and optimises a battery storage facility in Gothenburg that is part of Effekthandel Väst. In the Västra Götaland region, the company also operates and optimises battery storage facilities in Falköping and Lerum, and is constructing additional sites in Tuve, Lidköping, and Götene. These facilities are expected to be commissioned in 2026. All six battery storage sites are jointly owned with Locus Energy.\nIngrid builds the infrastructure and software that make the European power grid more intelligent\nIn total, Ingrid has more than 20 battery storage facilities in operation or under construction in Sweden’s SE3 and SE4 price areas. The company is currently building Finland’s largest battery storage system - 70 MW / 140 MWh in Nivala - a project jointly owned with Locus Energy. Ingrid recently announced a partnership with Energiequelle GmbH to develop a 200 MW portfolio of battery storage projects in Germany.\nIn addition to energy storage, Ingrid develops advanced optimization solutions for battery systems and renewable energy assets, creates structures for green energy supply and power offtake agreements, and provides innovative solutions for grid operators.\nAbout Ingrid\nThe future runs on electricity, but the system behind it is stuck in the past. Ingrid builds the infrastructure and software that make the power grid more intelligent, helping accelerate a resilient and clean energy transition. Our solutions include grid-scale energy storage, advanced optimisation for battery systems and renewable assets, green energy supply and offtake structures, and innovative grid services. By increasing grid flexibility, stabilising power flows and improving the utilisation of existing infrastructure, we help reduce grid bottlenecks, support the integration of new renewable generation and contribute to more stable, lower electricity prices. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Stockholm, Ingrid has 70+ employees, operates across the Nordics and is expanding throughout Europe. As of Q4 2025, we have more than 650 MWh of storage in operation or under construction, and over 250 MWh of assets optimised through our in-house trading and optimisation platform.\nAbout Göteborg Energi\nGöteborg Energi is an energy company owned by the City of Gothenburg, which means we work for all Gothenburg residents and for the entire city.\nFor us, it’s about thinking ahead and taking greater responsibility. We drive the transition so that Gothenburg gets the smart and sustainable energy and city fiber solutions that the future demands.\nIt’s about renewable energy, smart systems, and energy-efficient solutions for housing, businesses, and transportation. The challenges are many, and to achieve a sustainable society, we need to work together — with our customers, our owners, and our partners.\nContact:\nIngrid\nSandra Lindholm-Wu\nHead of Communications\nSandra.lindholm.wu@ingridcapacity.com\nGöteborg Energi\nCecilia Erdalen\nHead of Media Relations\ncecilia.erdalen@goteborgenergi.se",
