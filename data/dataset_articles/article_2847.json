  "text": "MISSOULA — A Bozeman man who possessed methamphetamine and fentanyl was sentenced Wednesday to 120 months in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release, U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme said in a release.\nRene Montenegro-Virrey, 51, pleaded guilty in December 2024 to possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.\nU.S. District Judge Dana L. Christensen presided.\nThe government alleged in court documents that in August 2022 drug investigators learned that Montenegro-Virrey was planning a trip to Bozeman to deliver 7,000 fentanyl pills and five pounds of methamphetamine. Over the next several months, drugs were purchased from the defendant through undercover purchases and controlled buys, Alme said in the release.\nIn August 2024, Montenegro-Virrey met with undercover officers for another transaction. Four pounds of methamphetamine was seized from his vehicle.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecuted the case and the investigation was conducted by the Missouri River Drug Task Force.\nThis case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and gun violence, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone.\nOn May 26, 2021, the department launched a violent crime reduction strategy strengthening PSN based on these core principles: fostering trust and legitimacy in our communities, supporting community-based organizations that help prevent violence from occurring in the first place, setting focused and strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring the results.\nFor more information about Project Safe Neighborhoods, please visit https://www.justice.gov/psn .\nLet the news come to you Get any of our free daily email newsletters — news headlines, opinion, e-edition, obituaries and more.\nExplore newsletters (0 Ratings)",
