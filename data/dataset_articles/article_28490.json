  "text": "Renewable energy solutions specialist Greenvolt Next, part of Greenvolt Group, has completed the development of a 4 MW solar PV plant for biopharmaceutical firm Sanofi in Co Waterford.\nThe project was structured under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), and required no upfront investment from Sanofi. It allow the pharma company to access renewable electricity at a stable and predictable price, while benefiting from long-term operational certainty.\nGreenvolt Next designed and delivered the 4 MW solar PV plant, comprising more than 5,700 panels and 10 inverters.\nThe installation will generate approximately 3.2 GWh of renewable electricity annually, covering around 20% of the site's energy needs and enabling the avoidance of 950 tonnes of CO₂ each year.\nIts delivery was completed within a four-month schedule.\nGreenvolt Next will operate and maintain the facility for 20 years, ensuring performance, safety and reliability throughout its lifecycle.\nOwen Power, CEO of Greenvolt Next Ireland & UK, said the project was particularly meaningful for the company, not only because it delivers a direct positive impact for the Waterford community - where Greenvolt Next is also based - but also because it reflects the trust placed in its expertise and execution capabilities by a global company of Sanofi's scale.\n\"We have built a strong track record across multiple industries, including a significant presence in the pharma cluster, which continues to reinforce our leadership in the commercial and industrial renewable energy sector,\" he added.\nCian O Brien, Site Lead at Sanofi Ireland, said that generating its own renewable energy on-site is vital in helping the company meet its sustainability targets, aiming for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 across all scopes, with a trajectory towards carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\"With Greenvolt Next Ireland's expertise in renewable energy installations for large businesses like us, we will be able to significantly reduce our reliance on the grid, generating 20% of our energy on-site each year,\" he stated.\nMinister of State Mary Butler said the project was an impressive initiative that represents a significant step forward for clean energy and sustainable infrastructure in Waterford.\n\"It is so important that we strive to continue developing smart energy solutions at community level. Such local investments in renewable energy are particularly important in the context of our national commitments and climate targets,\" she said.\n\"It sets a precedent for others to follow, having one of the largest renewable installations of this kind in the heart of our city,\" she added.",
