Here are Hindustan Times’ 5 best picks to visit in India during winter to experience snowfall.\nAfter months of dealing with heat, dust, and busy routines, winter feels like a breath of fresh air. It is the season when some of us love to stay wrapped in warm blankets with a cup of warm tea, while others eagerly step out to chase snow and mountain views. If you belong to the second group and dream of watching snowfall, building snowmen, or simply enjoying snow-covered landscapes, India has some beautiful winter destinations waiting for you. Here are Hindustan Times’ 5 best picks to visit in India during winter to experience snowfall.\nChopta, Uttarakhand\nA quiet and charming place surrounded by lush meadows and evergreen forests, Chopta is located in Uttarakhand and is part of the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary. During winter, the entire region gets covered in a thick white layer of snow that often lasts till March.
