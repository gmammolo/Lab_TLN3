  "text": "Hamilton man accused of trying to lure 8-year-old boy from park during softball game\nDanifer Mark charged with child enticement, aggravated menacing\nDanifer Mark charged with child enticement, aggravated menacing\nDanifer Mark charged with child enticement, aggravated menacing\nDanifer Mark of Hamilton was booked into the Butler County Jail on Tuesday night. Police charged the 42-year-old Mark with child enticement and aggravated menacing, both first-degree misdemeanors.\nA police officer made the arrest after parents called to say Mark — who was shooting videos of girls playing softball — tried to keep recording inside one of the team's dugouts.\nAccording to notes from an investigator, Mark also shot video of kids running around and playing near the Badin Rams softball field.\nThen, Mark allegedly started talking to an 8-year-old boy, putting his arm around the boy and walking him away from the field.\nMark apparently said to the child, \"Come with me.\"\nParents intervened. The boy's uncle confronted Mark, who was accused of threatening to follow the boy's 41-year-old uncle home and kill him, allegedly telling the uncle he would wait for him to leave Joyce Park and that he knew what car the boy's uncle was driving.\nWLWT's Todd Dykes talked to the boy's mother on Wednesday. While she declined to do an interview, the boy's mother was clearly upset with what took place during a family-friendly ballgame on what was supposed to be a quiet Tuesday night.\nDuring his arraignment on Wednesday, a judge set Danifer Mark's bond at just north of $10,000. Mark is due back in court next week.",
