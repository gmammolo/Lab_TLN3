  "text": "Summer’s calling: Stay safe on the water\nWith summer just around the corner, thousands of us will be heading out to enjoy our region’s stunning lakes and rivers. Whether you’re jet boating on the braided rivers or paddling close to shore, one thing is clear: safety matters every single time you hit the water.\nThe hidden risk close to shore\nThe sobering fact is, around 70 per cent of recreational boating fatalities in Aotearoa New Zealand happen within one nautical mile of shore, and 40 per cent occur within just 400 metres. Why? Because being near land often gives people a false sense of security. But shallow areas can hide hazards like bars, reefs, and breaking waves. Even calm conditions can turn dangerous in seconds.\nAdventure with caution when jet boating\nOur rivers are jet boating heaven, but they’re also unpredictable. Over the years, several serious jet boating incidents have occurred on Waitaha Canterbury waterways. High speeds, shallow channels, and sudden changes in river flow demand skill and preparation.\nThe three golden rules\nWear a fitted lifejacket\n- Waitaha Canterbury bylaws require everyone on vessels under six metres — including kayaks and paddleboards — to wear a lifejacket at all times. Even close to shore, accidents happen fast.\nTake two waterproof forms of communication\n- Cell coverage is patchy in lake areas like Ruataniwha, Takapō Tekapo, and Aviemore. A PLB (personal locator beacon) is your best bet, backed up by a satellite device, flares, or an air horn.\nCheck the forecast before you go\n- High country weather changes in a heartbeat. If a nor’wester is brewing or conditions look dicey, stay on land.\nMeet Buoy-Boy – Your cheeky safety mate\nThis season, keep an eye out for Buoy Boy, our new floating safety ambassador! He’s bright, bold, and bobbing just offshore to remind you of the basics:\n- Wear your lifejacket\n- Check the weather\n- Take two forms of communication\nHe’s fun, friendly, and uniquely Kiwi — snap a photo and share the safety message with us on Facebook or Instagram.\nYour summer, your safety\nOur Coast and Harbours team play a vital role in keeping you safe by monitoring waterways, educating boaties, and enforcing maritime rules.\nIf you see the team at a boat ramp or on the water this summer, stop for a chat — they’re a great source of local knowledge, because every safe journey starts with shared responsibility.\nPlan ahead, gear up, and respect the water. Kia mataara - know the ways of the water before you let go of the land.",
