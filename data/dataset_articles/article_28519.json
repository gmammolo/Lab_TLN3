  "text": "We extend a special thank you to Com-Ed and Mike Dodge, External Manager of the South Region, for generously providing “Storm Bags”. These bags are available free of charge at City Hall while supplies last.\nPower outages can occur unexpectedly, and having a Storm Bag on hand ensures that you and your family are better prepared in advance. The contents of these bags are designed to help you manage during outages and stay safe until power is restored.\nAdditionally, we encourage everyone to download the Com-Ed mobile app. This app allows you to easily report storms, receive timely alerts and updates, and view outage maps directly from your mobile device.",
