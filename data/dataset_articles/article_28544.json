  "text": "사진 확대 At the 'World Hydrozen Expo 2025' held at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province on the 4th, participants including Kim Sung-hwan, Minister of Climate, Energy, and Environment (fourth from the left in the front row), and Jang Jae-hoon, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Group (fifth), are shouting fighting. Yonhap News Agency Hyundai Motor Group is planning to innovate its cost so that it can become globally competitive by 2027 by streamlining production of hydrogen fuel cells. From hydrogen production and supply to hydrogen electric vehicles, ships, logistics equipment, and automatically charging vehicles, it plans to grow the industrial ecosystem throughout the electric cycle.\nHyundai Motor Group showcased a number of cutting-edge technologies related to the hydrogen industry ecosystem at the 'World Hydrogen Expo 2025', a hydrogen industry fair that opened at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province on the 4th. It introduced advanced technologies such as water electrolysis technology, mobile hydrogen charging stations, and hydrogen electric vehicle automatic charging robots.\n\"Now, we need to build cost competitiveness not only in hydrogen cars but also in electric motors,\" said Jang Jae-hoon, vice chairman of Hyundai Motor Group. \"In particular, we are planning internal innovation with the goal of 2027 to increase performance and cost competitiveness for hydrogen fuel cells, and we need to have global competitiveness in this field.\"\n\"We are looking into the field of water electrolysis regarding how to make hydrogen economically well,\" he said. \"We are looking at expandability to ships and agricultural machinery in addition to vehicles so that fuel cells can be used in various industries.\" Water electrolysis is a technology that electrolyzes water to produce high-purity clean hydrogen. Hyundai Motor Group announced in October that it will hold a groundbreaking ceremony for its new hydrogen fuel cell plant in Ulsan and build Korea's first polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis production base by 2027. As Hyundai Motor Group has a large number of affiliates that are in contact with the hydrogen ecosystem, it has also diagnosed that it is much more advantageous in terms of cost competitiveness than other companies.\n[Reporter Kim Jung Hwan / Reporter Han Ji Yeon]\nThis article has been translated by GripLabs Mingo AI.",
