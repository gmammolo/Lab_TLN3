We look forward to working with partners worldwide to help build a net-zero future.”\nTrinasolar integrates its SOLAR sustainability management framework into its corporate strategy, governance processes, and global operations to support sustainable manufacturing and improve energy efficiency. The company has established a comprehensive Environmental Social and Governance management system that covers risk identification, target setting, and implementation, ensuring that sustainability objectives are executed effectively.\nIn recent years, Trinasolar has received multiple accolades from international organizations in recognition of its leading ESG performance. The company received the 2024–2025 Forbes China Sustainable Development Industrial Enterprise Award and the EcoVadis 2025 Silver Medal, and it ranks first in BloombergNEF’s global ESG scoring for PV manufacturers. In 2025, Sustainable Fitch assigned Trinasolar an ESG Entity Rating of “2” with a score of 81—the highest among assessed PV manufacturers worldwide and in the Asia-Pacific region.\nTrinasolar has also strengthened supply-chain transparency and sustainable products. The company earned the AA rating for PV supply chain traceability from TÜV Rheinland, covering\nall stages from polysilicon to modules, the highest possible rating, underscoring the transparency and reliability of its supply chain. Its Vertex N modules, Elementa 2 energy storage system, and full product line of TrinaTracker Vanguard series have all earned third-party carbon-footprint or EPD certifications.",
