  "text": "The Union County Jail is going up for sale. On Thursday, the Union County Board of County Commissioners will cast a vote in their regularly scheduled meeting, which will allow them to see who is interested in buying the property in downtown Elizabeth. The Union County Jail has been closed since 2021. All of the inmates once housed there were moved to Essex County, a savings of $100 million for Union. When it goes up for sale, there are concerns that it’ll be bought by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and turned into an immigrant detention center. RELATED: Newark mayor vows to not let Delaney Hall become immigrant detention center RELATED: Group rallies at Elizabeth Detention Center in protest of ICE Those who represent the families being targeted by the Trump administration for mass deportation are worried. “It’s going to normalize this sense of fear in the community. It’s going to make it OK to incarcerate people for profit,” said Banan Bdelrahman, with American Friends Service Committee. ICE is already planning to reopen Delaney Hall, a detention center by the airport in Newark. That plan has been met with protests. The Union County commissioners have said publicly that they have no plans for the jail before proposals are submitted.",
