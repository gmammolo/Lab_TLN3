  "text": "The city of Fishers has earned more than $177,000 in rebates from Duke Energy as a result of several energy efficiency upgrades recently installed in city facilities. The cost savings come from Duke Energy’s Smart $aver® program for organizations and businesses, which provides cash rebates and custom incentives to encourage the purchase and installation of energy-efficient equipment.\nAs part of multiple development projects, the city leveraged Duke Energy’s Smart $aver business program to capitalize on rebates. For example, the city’s projects at the community center and events center qualified for rebates on highly-efficient interior and exterior lighting, lighting controls and HVAC equipment.\n“This collaboration with Duke Energy has helped us advance projects that were designed with sustainability and energy efficiency in mind,” Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness said. “We’re grateful for their engagement on planning for these buildings, which helped us reduce operating costs while also focusing on environmental responsibility.”\nWhy it matters\nCombined, these upgrades account for nearly 540,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of saved energy per year. That energy savings equates to approximately 576 tons of carbon dioxide reduction, or the equivalent of removing 111 passenger cars from the road each year. LaBarr\n“Programs like this not only help our customers manage their costs, they also help us reduce the demand for energy on our system and delay the need for new power generation,” Duke Energy Indiana Government and Community Relations Manager Mark LaBarr said. “Through Smart $aver, in particular, we have helped participating Indiana businesses save more than $27 million over the last four years.”",
