  "text": "A Total of 14 Evaluation Criteria Including Effluent Water Quality and Safety Management\nBuan County in North Jeolla Province has been selected as an outstanding local government in the 2025 Public Wastewater Treatment Facility Operation and Management Assessment, organized by the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment.\nThe county announced on the 4th that it received a Minister’s Commendation and a reward of 10 million won as an outstanding local government at the 2025 Joint Forum on Ecotoxicity and Secondary Battery Wastewater, held at Phoenix Jeju.\nThe Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment conducts a comprehensive annual assessment of public wastewater treatment facilities managed by industrial and agro-industrial complexes nationwide, evaluating a total of 14 items including wastewater inflow rate, treatment efficiency, effluent water quality, and safety management.\nThis year’s assessment began in August with the first round of document review targeting 108 local governments across the country. Of these, five outstanding local governments were selected for a second evaluation by the Ministry’s review committee.\nBuan County achieved a meaningful milestone by becoming the first local government in North Jeolla Special Self-Governing Province to be recognized as outstanding in the field of wastewater treatment facilities.\nThe Buan Agro-Industrial Complex No. 2 Public Wastewater Treatment Facility, which received the outstanding evaluation, was completed in September 2014 and has a daily treatment capacity of 5,100 tons. For the first time since its completion, it has been recognized as an outstanding institution in a national assessment.\nThe county has proactively established an advanced environmental management system by improving outdated facilities, professionalizing operational personnel, and enhancing the functionality of the effluent water quality data management program.\nCounty Governor Kwon Ikhyeon stated, \"Being selected as an outstanding local government this time is highly meaningful, as it recognizes that we operate public wastewater treatment facilities most safely and efficiently nationwide. We will continue to do our utmost to create a sustainable environmental foundation and improve the quality of life for our residents through efficient management of wastewater treatment plants.\"\n© The Asia Business Daily(www.asiae.co.kr).
