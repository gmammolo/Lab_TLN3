  "text": "Anchored on the theme “Sequestering Carbon, Restoring Nature: Reviving the Lake Lanai-Agus River Watershed One Tree at a Time”, this initiative reflects a long-term vision of restoring ecological balance and strengthening watershed health. It serves as a testament that real and lasting flood mitigation begins with planting trees, protecting forests, and nurturing the land.\nThe tree-growing activity also supports the establishment of an additional one-hectare reforestation project under the Energy Sector Carbon Sequestration Initiatives (ESCSI) Program, which focuses on offsetting carbon emission through reforestation and watershed rehabilitation. This event demonstrated a unified commitment to environmental restoration and community protection.\nThrough these joint efforts, participants reinforced the understanding that effective and lasting flood mitigation starts with planting trees, restoring forests, and caring for the watershed.",
