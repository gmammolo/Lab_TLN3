Photo by World Hydrogen Expo Organizing Committee\n원본보기 아이콘\nKim Sung-hwan, Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, attended the opening ceremony of the World Hydrogen Expo (WHE) 2025 held at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province on December 4, 2025, and announced, \"The government will take responsibility and lower the price of hydrogen to below 2,500 won per kilogram.\"\nHydrogen is drawing attention as a future eco-friendly energy source, but its high price has slowed its adoption. Currently, the international price of green hydrogen is around $3 to $6 per kilogram (4,400 to 8,800 won).\nMinister Kim stated, \"In order for the steel industry to remain competitive in hydrogen-based direct reduction steelmaking, it is said that hydrogen must be supplied at around 2,500 won per kilogram. POSCO will soon build a demonstration plant for hydrogen-based direct reduction steelmaking with a capacity of 300,000 tons, and the government will take responsibility to supply hydrogen at the 2,500 won level, so POSCO can confidently transition to hydrogen-based steelmaking.\"\nMinister Kim had previously visited POSCO's Pohang Steelworks on October 15, shortly after the launch of the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment (October 1, 2025), to inspect the demonstration project for hydrogen-based steelmaking.\nThe steel industry accounts for 17.8% of South Korea's greenhouse gas emissions, with POSCO making up the largest share. The steel industry is pursuing hydrogen-based direct reduction steelmaking to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but the high price of hydrogen has been cited as a major obstacle.\nPOSCO plans to build a demonstration plant for hydrogen-based direct reduction steelmaking by 2028. Minister Kim promised POSCO that the hydrogen price would be lowered to around 2,500 won per kilogram by then.\nHowever, the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment appears likely to focus its hydrogen policy on green hydrogen and pink hydrogen, rather than the cheaper gray hydrogen.\nOn this day, Minister Kim said, \"Producing hydrogen at a low cost is a global challenge, and Korea must also solve this issue as soon as possible.\" He added, \"Reforming liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the cheapest method, but instead of that, the task is to produce hydrogen at the lowest possible cost from renewable energy, nuclear power, or other methods, so that it no longer impacts the climate crisis and can be used as an energy source.\"\nMinister Kim emphasized green hydrogen, produced by electrolyzing water using renewable energy, and pink hydrogen, produced from nuclear power plants. He is understood not to prefer gray hydrogen, produced by reforming LNG, or blue hydrogen, which involves capturing carbon from gray hydrogen, due to their carbon emissions.\nMinister Kim stated, \"Hydrogen must take on challenges that electricity cannot solve in various fields,\" and added, \"We will contribute to building and expanding the hydrogen ecosystem, including transportation and utilization.\"\nLaurent Antoni, Chair of IPHE, is delivering the keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the World Hydrogen Expo 2025 held on December 4th at KINTEX in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. 2025.12.4 World Hydrogen Expo Organizing Committee\n원본보기 아이콘\nLaurent Antoni, Chair of the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE), who delivered the keynote speech that day, also identified lowering the price of low-carbon hydrogen, such as blue hydrogen and green hydrogen, as a key task. According to IPHE, the price of gray hydrogen is $1.5 to $2.5 per kilogram, while blue hydrogen is $2 to $3, and green hydrogen is $3 to $6, showing a significant difference.\nChairman Antoni also emphasized the need to standardize hydrogen certification systems, which vary by country. He stated, \"Different certification systems by country can cause disruptions in international trade and regulatory conflicts,\" and added, \"The next two to three years will be a critical period for establishing global certification alignment.\"\n© The Asia Business Daily(www.asiae.co.kr).
