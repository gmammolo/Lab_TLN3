  "text": "Duni AB +0.87% Duni Group is expanding its concept with the launch of vacuum and composting solutions designed to reduce food waste and cut plastic usage. Vacuum packaging extends shelf life, while composting turns organic waste into soil--giving foodservice operators a solution that strengthens both profitability and sustainability. Despite improved planning and growing awareness, food waste remains a structural challenge globally.\nWith Duniform®? vacuum machines, food can stay fresh up to five times longer, reducing waste and streamlining logistics. At the same time, Duniform®?\ncomposting machines transform organic waste into soil within 24 hours, minimizing the need for external waste management and creating tangible value from what would otherwise be lost. Combined with compostable and recyclable packaging, these solutions enable a closed-loop system where resources are preserved and food waste is minimized--delivering clear benefits for both businesses and the environment. Duniform®?\nsolutions are available via Duniform.se and Duni Group's reseller network. The range includes machine systems, aftermarket service, and compatible packaging, supported by expert advice tailored to different operational needs.\n© S&P Capital IQ - 2025",
