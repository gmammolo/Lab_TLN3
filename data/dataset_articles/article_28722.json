  "text": "Vermont Christmas trees plentiful despite tough weather, leaders say\nGov. Phil Scott and Vermont Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts kicked off the holiday season with a visit to Martin’s Tree Farm in East Corinth, where they selected two Christmas trees to cut that will decorate the Pavilion Building in Montpelier.\nMartin’s Tree Farm, owned by Mary and Jeff Martin, has been in operation for 18 years. The couple has lived in East Corinth for 40 years, according to a press release.\n“Each year we become more excited about the Christmas season and having the public, our friends and neighbors visit to pick a tree,” Mary said. “We love where we live, and we love Vermont. As Vermonters we want to protect the land so that’s why we focus on cut your own trees. We spend all our time working on our land, gardening, taking care of the trees and spending time with our animals and family.”\nAccording to the 2022 U.S. Department of Agriculture's census, Vermont has 3,495 acres of Christmas tree production across 260 farms, with a crop worth more than $2.6 million. Despite weather challenges this year, including a wet spring and a drought this summer, local tree growers are reporting an abundant supply of healthy, vibrant trees ready for the season, the state says.\nVeronica Francis, executive director of the New Hampshire-Vermont Christmas Tree Association, praised the resilience of Christmas tree growers.\n“Even when the weather tests them, their knowledge and dedication ensure that families across New England can experience the magic of a real Christmas tree,” Francis said.\nTebbetts said choosing a Vermont-grown tree has environmental and economic benefits.\nA Vermont tree can be found this time of year in many urban locations around the region. Each year, Vermont holiday trees decorate homes in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, with thousands of Green Mountain trees sold in urban pop-up markets.\nIn addition, visitors to Vermont participate in the holiday tradition by hauling home freshly cut trees. Vermont’s pick-your-own crop is prepared for the season, with plenty of trees to choose from when you visit your nearest Christmas tree farm.\nFor a full listing of Christmas tree growers open to the public, visit nh-vtchristmastree.org.\nThis story was created by reporter Beth McDermott, bmcdermott1@usatodayco.com, with the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
