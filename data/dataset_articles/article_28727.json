  "text": "Fremantle Seaweed Announces Major Operational Milestone to Advance Methane-Reduction Solutions for Australian Agriculture By: Newsfile December 04, 2025 at 04:42 AM EST Sydney, Australia--(Newsfile Corp. - December 4, 2025) - Fremantle Seaweed , Western Australia's leading ocean-tech Asparagopsis producer, has announced a significant operational milestone as it progresses from pilot-scale activity into commercial manufacturing. The company has secured $2.3 million in seed funding to support this transition, marking a key step forward for Australia's capacity to deliver large-volume, scientifically validated methane-reduction solutions to beef and dairy producers.\nFremantle Seaweed’s Asparagopsis farm in Western Australia\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/11704/276415_9af8f48a94af0ac2_001full.jpg\nThe company has focused the past four years on designing and testing the technology, engineering systems, and marine infrastructure needed to reliably cultivate and process the seaweed at scale.\nFremantle Seaweed has established high-density longline cultivation systems, modular hatchery units, and a purpose-built harvesting vessel-forming an integrated ocean-tech platform from hatchery through to environmental processing.\nThe company's North-West Hub, a 3,000-hectare site under development, is expected to become the centrepiece of its commercial rollout. Once operational, modelling indicates the site could have the capacity to supply a substantial share of the Asparagopsis needed by Australia's dairy and feedlot operators.\nTo support industry readiness, Fremantle Seaweed is preparing a 400-day Wagyu feedlot trial involving 60 head of cattle and more than 1,500 kilograms of dried Asparagopsis. Conducted under commercial feeding conditions, the trial is structured to generate real-world performance, productivity, and emissions data—information producers have identified as critical for widescale market adoption.\nLeadership Commentary\nChris De Cuyper, Co-founder & Managing Director , said:\n\"The support behind Fremantle Seaweed has been incredible. Our analysis shows that scaling to the North-West Hub could abate close to one million tonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions each year, roughly the same as offsetting a small LNG facility. That's the kind of real-world impact that investors, producers, and policymakers are looking for.\n\"What excites me most is the sense of shared purpose. Farmers want practical, natural tools that make sense on-farm, and our job is to deliver those - technology that fits seamlessly into existing systems and creates value across the board.\"\nIndustry Context\nAccess to stable, large-volume supply has been a limiting factor for commercial adoption globally. Fremantle Seaweed's transition into commercial production represents a meaningful shift in addressing that bottleneck within the Australian market.\nAbout Fremantle Seaweed\nFremantle Seaweed is a Western Australian ocean-technology company pioneering the domestic cultivation of Asparagopsis seaweed-a natural feed ingredient scientifically demonstrated to reduce cattle methane emissions. Combining marine science, engineering innovation, and producer partnerships, the company is working to advance Australia's blue-economy capabilities while supporting practical emissions reduction pathways for the agricultural sector.\nMedia Contact\nContact Person: Ann Murphy\nCompany: Fremantle Seaweed\nEmail: media@fremantleseaweed.com\nWebsite: http://fremantleseaweed.com/\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/276415",
