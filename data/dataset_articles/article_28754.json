  "text": "Quzhou embraces green development\nLucid waters and lush forests create a picturesque landscape in Quzhou. [Photo/WeChat account: quzhoufb]\nThe municipal government of Quzhou in Zhejiang province held a news conference on Dec 3 to highlight the city's major progress in green development during China's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021–25).\nQuzhou has made substantial progress in environmental quality. In 2024, Quzhou's surface water quality ranked 15th nationally, a record high. The city pioneered the construction of a national \"waste-free city\", eliminating the landfill disposal of waste and fly ash.\nThe city has also made strides in promoting the green and low-carbon transformation of traditional industries, the energy mix, and the transportation sector.\nIn the past five years, the city has upgraded 1,368 high-energy, low-efficiency enterprises. In 2024, the growth rate of the high-tech industry's added value topped the province. Renewable energy now constitutes 65.7 percent of the city's installed capacity, significantly above the provincial average.\nQuzhou has advanced its environmental protection, strengthening ecological restoration and enhancing biodiversity conservation.\nThe city is home to 10,643 species, representing 82.28 percent of Zhejiang's total, showcasing a harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.\nEconomic gains have been boosted through the value realization of ecological assets. Local villagers have established a total of 1,618 \"ecological accounts\" for managing, accounting, and trading ecological products, and the city has also pioneered a smart monitoring system for carbon emissions.",
