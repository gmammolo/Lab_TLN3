  "text": "US to deny visas, green cards over pro-terror, antisemitic social media posts\nUSCIS will now deny or revoke visas based on social media posts supporting antisemitic terrorism. The immediate policy shift targets online speech and follows recent arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists.\nIn Short\n- US visas may be denied for anti-Semitic social media posts\n- Policy effective immediately under Trump's administration\n- USCIS to scrutinise social media for anti-Semitic content\nYour social media activity could lead to the rejection or revocation of your US visa. In a statement, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that immigration authorities will scrutinise social media accounts and deny visas or residency permits to individuals posting content deemed anti-Semitic under President Donald Trump's administration. The policy will go into effect immediately.\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement, “There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathisers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here.”\n“Sec. Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” McLaughlin said.\nALSO READ: US revokes student visas: What Indian students should do after deportation notices\nIn a statement issued Wednesday morning, the DHS said it will strictly enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organisations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: “the Houthis.”\nUSCIS will now consider social media posts endorsing or promoting antisemitic terrorism or related activity as a negative factor in immigration evaluations. The policy is effective immediately and applies to visa applications, green card requests, and other discretionary immigration benefits.\nThe official statement comes amid reports that the Trump administration has recently revoked the visas of hundreds of international students across the United States. This announcement follows the widely publicised arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists, including Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, whom the government accuses of participating in antisemitic activities.",
