  "text": "The University of Rhode Island is tapping into geothermal energy as it works to become a net-zero carbon emissions institution.\nThe university will heat and cool its new Ocean Frontiers Building at its Narragansett Bay Campus with geothermal energy drawn from underground reservoirs of hot water, according to a press release.\n“Geothermal systems reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions, stimulate the green economy and provide long-term savings related to operating and lifecycle replacement costs,” said Seth Pilotte, manager of construction projects at the Narragansett Bay Campus.",
