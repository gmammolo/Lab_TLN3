  "text": "1 /10 Mumbai to Undergo Massive Transformation in the Next 5–7 Years Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that Mumbai is set for a historic transformation over the next five to seven years, with multiple large-scale infrastructure projects progressing simultaneously. Speaking at a town hall at NSCI Dome, Worli, he emphasized that all ongoing mega city infra projects will be completed by 2032, reshaping the city’s transport ecosystem. The CM said these developments will improve north–south and east–west connectivity, reduce road congestion, and deliver a more efficient, future-ready Mumbai. (AI Image)\n2 /10 Versova–Dahisar–Bhayander Sea Link Extension to Boost Western Suburban Connectivity One of the key infrastructure upgrades highlighted by the CM is the extension of the sea link to Versova, Dahisar and Bhayander. This extended corridor will provide a fast, uninterrupted route for lakhs of daily commuters, significantly reducing travel time between the western suburbs and cutting dependency on overcrowded arterial routes. The project is expected to play a central role in decongesting major road networks and offering a seamless coastal connectivity option. (AI Image)\n3 /10 New Dahisar Link Road and Free-Flow Bridges to Combat Mumbai’s Traffic Woes To further address Mumbai’s long-standing traffic challenges, Fadnavis detailed plans for a new link road from Dahisar, supported by a series of free-flow bridges designed to eliminate traffic bottlenecks. These projects, currently under rapid development, aim to create faster diversions, smoother vehicular movement and reduced peak-hour delays. The enhanced road infrastructure is expected to improve connectivity between residential hubs, business districts and transit points. (AI Image)\n4 /10 Major Tunnel Projects to Make Mumbai a ‘Fully Tunnelled City’ CM Fadnavis announced that Mumbai is moving towards becoming a completely tunnelled city, thanks to ongoing mega tunnel projects across key locations. These include tunnels connecting BKC to surrounding regions and several new underground links designed to minimize surface-level congestion. By diverting traffic below ground, the city aims to increase average travel speed, cut commuting time, and build a more resilient transport network that can withstand monsoon challenges. (AI Image)\n5 /10 Entire Mumbai Metro Network to Be Ready Within the Next 5 Years As part of the government’s aggressive transport expansion plan, the CM assured that the entire Mumbai Metro network will be completed in the next five years. The integrated system will connect major suburbs, commercial zones, and residential clusters, offering millions of commuters a reliable, high-speed alternative to road travel. Once operational, the Metro will form the backbone of Mumbai’s public transport future, reducing pressure on buses, autos and private vehicles. (AI Image)\n6 /10 New Traffic Alternatives to Reduce Load on Western Express Highway Highlighting the urgency of easing congestion on the Western Express Highway (WEH)—which currently handles nearly 60% of Mumbai’s total traffic—Fadnavis said that new tunnels, elevated connectors, and coastal routes will serve as strong alternatives. These new corridors will divert heavy load from WEH, leading to faster movement of vehicles and more efficient traffic distribution. The reduced strain on Mumbai’s busiest expressway will contribute to smoother daily travel for commuters across the city. (AI Image)\n7 /10 Dharavi Redevelopment to Include 30% Green Zones for Sustainable Living In a major update on the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, Fadnavis revealed that 30% of the area will be preserved as green zones, making it one of the most environmentally conscious urban renewal projects in India. This allocation aims to balance high-density living with essential open spaces, parks and ecological buffers. The redevelopment will not only improve living standards but also introduce cleaner, greener and more sustainable urban planning practices in the heart of the city.\n8 /10 Mumbai’s Public Transport to Move Toward Full Electrification and Zero Emissions Addressing concerns around climate change and rising pollution, the CM emphasized that Mumbai’s public transport system is undergoing rapid electrification, with the long-term goal of zero-emission mobility. He noted that public transport remains a major contributor to urban pollution, and shifting to electric buses, EV fleets and clean energy systems will significantly reduce the city’s carbon footprint. The electrification drive will make Mumbai a model for eco-friendly urban transport. (AI Image)\n9 /10 Sewage Treatment Plants to Ensure Only Treated Water Enters the Arabian Sea Mumbai’s modern sewage treatment plants (STPs) are expected to be fully operational by next year, ensuring that only treated and purified water is discharged into the sea. This initiative is vital for enhancing coastal water quality, safeguarding marine life, and maintaining cleaner beaches. The upgraded STPs represent one of Mumbai’s most significant environmental reforms, reinforcing the city’s commitment to a sustainable and pollution-free coastline.(AI Image)\n10 /10 New Roads and Link Networks to Improve Travel Speed Mumbai is seeing the development of new link roads and elevated networks, including connections over the Western Express Highway and other key corridors. These projects, combined with tunnels and bridges, are designed to increase average travel speeds, reduce congestion, and provide commuters with faster, more efficient routes across the city, making daily travel smoother and more reliable.
