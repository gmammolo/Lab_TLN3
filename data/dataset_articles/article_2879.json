  "text": "CRANSTON, R.I. (WJAR) — Providence police said Keiner Perez Salas, Howard Garcia, and Beickel Arellano were arrested in Providence Place Mall for allegedly shoplifting merchandise worth thousands of dollars.\nNow, the three face charges of larceny and conspiracy.\nHowever, police say this wasn't their first stop. The men are also believed to be connected to multiple shoplifting thefts that occurred at Garden City where items worth $7,000 dollars were stolen.\n\"I think the high-end stores tend to be attractive, I think these thieves target certain things, like the high-end products that they can sell in New York or wherever they're going to,\" said Cranston Chief of Police, Colonel Michael Winquist.\nThe men are believed to be a part of a South American retail theft group, with people who travel up and down the northeast, shoplifting expensive items and then selling them. Officials said they are becoming more professional and using bags lined with aluminum foil which hides the security devices on the merchandise from being detected.\n\"A lot of these stores don't have heavy security, and a lot of these products are in open view so they can be taken which, so they literally walk in,\" said Winquist. \"I'm not sure if there's any other groups here, but I can tell you that this is a trend that's occurring, there are plenty of other groups not necessarily South American groups, but groups in general, and this is how they make their money.\"\nPolice said the three men are originally from Venezuela and there's a possibility ICE could become involved.\n\"My guess is anytime we arrest anybody, and we fingerprint them, ICE is monitoring those fingerprints, and my guess is they'll be taking some type of action against them,\" he said.\nAccording to police, a warrant was issued for a fourth man believed to be involved in the thefts.",
