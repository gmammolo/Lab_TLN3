  "text": "Cllr Declan Burgess has issued a statement regarding the water pump station at Palmers Hill in Cashel.\nCllr Burgess says that the station becomes a point of failure in the town during water outages.\nREAD MORE: Work to start on next €2.9m phase of Carrick-on-Suir Regeneration Scheme in January\nHe said: \"There has been a longstanding and unacceptable issue with the pump station at Palmers Hill. Each time there are water outages in Cashel, this station once again becomes a point of failure. The pump station serving Palmers Hill and the surrounding areas has experienced repeated electrical faults, leading to ongoing system failures.\n\"Uisce Éireann has been aware of these problems for a number of years, yet no meaningful investment or upgrade works have been carried out. This situation cannot continue.\nREAD MORE: St Angela’s Academy presents an evening of musical theatre at Source Arts Centre\n\"I am calling on Uisce Éireann to immediately prioritise and deliver the necessary upgrades to the Palmers Hill pump station to ensure a reliable and consistent water supply for residents. The residents here have endured these disruptions for far too long.\"\nSubscribe or register today to discover more from DonegalLive.ie\nBuy the e-paper of the Donegal Democrat, Donegal People's Press, Donegal Post and Inish Times here for instant access to Donegal's premier news titles.\nKeep up with the latest news from Donegal with our daily newsletter featuring the most important stories of the day delivered to your inbox every evening at 5pm.",
