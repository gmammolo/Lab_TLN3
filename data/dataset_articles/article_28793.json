  "text": "ORANGE CITY, FL – Blue Spring State Park’s innovative Rolling Hikes program is breaking down barriers to outdoor recreation, offering nature enthusiasts of all mobility levels the chance to explore Florida’s stunning wilderness.\nUsing state-of-the-art all-terrain chairs, visitors can now traverse scenic trails and experience the park’s natural wonders like never before.\n“Being out in nature, you forget all your health problems, your worries,” shares Janis Williams, a Rolling Hikes participant who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2015. “It just makes you feel so much better when you are outside, with nature. It releases your endorphins.”\nJanis Williams explores the trails (WKMG-TV) While many visitors know Blue Spring State Park for its manatee viewing and crystal-clear springs, the park’s 2,600 acres offer much more to explore.\nThe Rolling Hikes program, launched two years ago by the nonprofit, Friends Of Blue Spring State Park , opens up miles of scenic trails to those with mobility challenges, ensuring everyone can experience the park’s diverse ecosystems and wildlife.\nKatherine Hallum, a Rolling Hikes volunteer, explains the program’s significance.\n“There are at least 13.5% of people in Florida who have mobility challenges,” Hallum said. “So many people just can’t go out and do a trail like they used to or have never been able to go out on a trail. That’s why we have these all-terrain chairs.”\nThe program’s specialized chairs are designed for comfort and safety, featuring:\nMultiple speed settings for user comfort All-terrain capabilities to handle natural obstacles Battery life for up to 14 miles of exploration Secure seating with safety straps Easy-to-use joystick controls with remote control options “This chair is so easy to use. Different speeds, very comfortable—I feel like I could drive this to California,” Williams enthusiastically shares. “My first time out here, I was out here about three hours.”\nThe Rolling Hikes program offers various experiences throughout the year, including:\nDaytime nature exploration Firefly viewing during season Full moon hikes Wildlife watching opportunities “We see bear, deer... We point out the mushrooms, the lichen and all these other things that somebody normally just walks by,” notes Hallum. “Florida is not a big view state, but there’s more micro views, and we point out a lot of that.”\nVolunteer, Katherine Hallum, points out places of interest along the trail (WKMG-TV) The impact of the Rolling Hikes program extends beyond physical accessibility. During a recent program kickoff, a 58-year-old participant confined to a wheelchair experienced her first-ever woodland trail. “She said this is the first time I’ve been in the woods—this is a bucket list item for me,” Hallum recalls.\nA 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered that individuals who walked for 90 minutes in a natural environment, compared to those who walked in a high-traffic urban setting, exhibited reduced activity in a brain region linked to a major factor in depression.\nAnother study in 2017 evaluated the impact of nature access for people with mobility disabilities. Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients improved their mobility more significantly when engaging in activities in nature compared to non-nature environments.\nThey also saw other health benefits, such as better cardiorespiratory capacity and lower and more stable blood pressure and heart rate. These improvements often appeared right after the activity and lasted into their daily lives. Researchers think the long-term benefits may come from being more physically active or increased self-confidence and motivation after exercising in challenging environments.\nReady to experience Blue Spring State Park’s Rolling Hikes program? Here’s how to get started:\nMake a reservation for one of the park’s two all-terrain chairs Choose between nature paths or paved trails based on your comfort level Join experienced guides who will ensure your safety and enhance your nature experience Enjoy the freedom to explore at your own pace To reserve your Rolling Hike experience or learn more about the program, visit the Friends Of Blue Spring State Park website or contact the park directly. The program welcomes participants of all mobility levels, whether you use mobility aids or simply want a more secure way to explore nature’s wonders.\nBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news alerts delivered to your inbox.",
