  "text": "2 hours ago On December 4, 2025, AJ's Walleye Lodge reported that snowmobile trails in the Lake Gogebic area near Bergland, Michigan, are not currently ridable. Recent storms caused heavy debris on the trails. The Gogebic Area Groomers have been working over 12-hour days to clear the trails. More volunteers are needed to make the trails passable and ready for grooming.\nA volunteer work party is scheduled for Friday, December 5, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time. Volunteers should meet at the Groomer Barn at 18245 Tuski Rd and bring a sled and chainsaw. AJ’s Lodge is offering free lodging for volunteers. AJ’s Oven will be open for meals on Friday and Saturday. For more information or to reserve rooms, contact Greg at 309-208-8624 or AJ’s at 906-575-3557.\nTrail conditions differ across the area. Trail 13N to M-28 is cleared. Trails such as Trail 1 North and Trail 2 are passable but may need more cleanup. Some sections, including Trail 13 south of Trail 100 and Trail 1 after 8800 to the county line, are closed. Clearing on Trail 8 East will begin Friday. Work on Trail 102 has not started.\nIndividuals may assist with trail cleanup but should expect rough and wet conditions. Only groomer tracks are present in many areas. The community is informed of ongoing efforts to restore the trails for winter use.\nVisit here for more details This post includes content assisted by AI tools.
