  "text": "The Green Engineering Research Group (GERG) at Durban University of Technology (DUT) proudly hosted the 41st International Conference on Green Chemical Engineering, Energy and Environmental Sustainability (GCEEES-25) from 17 to 18 November 2025, in Durban. This landmark event brought together leading scientists, engineers, scholars, postgraduate students, and industry experts from across the globe to share cutting-edge research and foster collaboration toward a sustainable future.\nIn his opening address, Conference Chair Dr Emmanuel Kweinor Tetteh, an NRF-rated researcher, highlighted the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable development. He highlighted that rapid population growth and industrialisation have intensified the demand for energy, materials, and natural resources, while environmental challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, pollution, and energy insecurity continue to threaten ecosystems and human well-being. Dr Tetteh emphasised that addressing these issues requires bold innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and actionable strategies.\nThe conference featured keynote presentations from distinguished experts. Prof. Dr. Willie Nheta from the University of Johannesburg delivered an insightful address on “Unlocking Value from the Fines: Innovative Strategies for the Flotation of Fine Platinum Group Minerals.” Similarly, Prof. Dr. Francis Kemausuor from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science & Technology, Ghana, spoke on “Catalysing Africa’s Energy Transition: Integrating Renewable Technologies for Climate-Compatible Growth.” These sessions guided discussions aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).\nDelegates explored a wide range of themes, including green chemical engineering, renewable energy technologies, circular economy strategies, climate change mitigation, and advanced water treatment systems. The event emphasised strengthening collaborations across academia, industry, and policy, enabling participants to engage in networking, establish partnerships, and explore collaborative pathways to accelerate innovation in sustainable engineering and energy systems.\nThe conference was guided by four distinguished session chairs: Prof Dr Willie Nheta (University of Johannesburg), Prof Dr Francis Kemausuor (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology), Dr Emmanuel Kweinor Tetteh (Durban University of Technology), and Dr Siphesihle Mangena Khumalo (Durban University of Technology). The adjudication panel included Prof Sudesh Rathilal (Durban University of Technology), Dr Thabit Jacob (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology), and Dr Mbalenhle Mpanza (University of Johannesburg).\nAll accepted papers were peer-reviewed and published in the official conference proceedings, available online at https://doi.org/10.17758/URUAE29 and https://caeer.org/procceeding.php/67, with an international ISBN: 978-989-9121-56-0. Selected works were featured in the African Journal of Green Engineering and Energy Research, ensuring global visibility and impact.\nRemarkably, postgraduate researchers from DUT’s Green Engineering Research Group dominated the Best Paper Awards, securing almost all top honours. These awards recognised outstanding contributions in originality, technical depth, and relevance to sustainability goals. Award recipients included S Dietsela, S Khanyile, R Lallie,\nS Kraai, N Ntombela, M Mbengwa, and C Munien.\nThe conference was organised in association with the Green Engineering Research Group (GERG), Department of Chemical Engineering, Durban University of Technology, and sponsored by Universal Researchers (UAE). Durban’s rich cultural heritage and world-class facilities provided an inspiring backdrop for this global gathering.\nAs the conference concluded, Prof Sudesh Rathilal expressed his deepest gratitude to all delegates, colleagues, and guests for making GCEEES-25 a resounding success. Over two days, participants witnessed inspiring presentations, engaged in thought-provoking discussions, and explored innovative solutions that will shape the future of sustainable engineering and energy systems. He reaffirmed that the transition toward sustainability is not just a global priority, it is a shared responsibility. Together, the conference addressed critical challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, energy insecurity, and environmental pollution, while exploring actionable strategies aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nProf Rathilal commended the keynote speakers, Prof Dr Willie Nheta, Prof Dr Francis Kemausuor, and other distinguished experts for setting the tone for impactful dialogue and collaboration. He noted that the diversity of perspectives from academia, industry, and policy enriched understanding and strengthened the resolve to innovate for a cleaner, more resilient, and equitable world. He congratulated the recipients of the Best Paper Awards, whose outstanding contributions exemplify originality, technical depth, and relevance to sustainability goals. “Your work inspires excellence and sets a benchmark for future research,” he said.\nOn behalf of the organising committee, Prof Rathilal extended heartfelt thanks to sponsors, partners, and contributors, including Universal Researchers (UAE) and GERG at DUT for their unwavering support. He encouraged participants to carry forward the spirit of collaboration and innovation and looked forward to welcoming them to the next annual event, where bridges between academia, industry, and policy will continue to be built and research that drives global sustainability will be celebrated.\nPictured: Prof Dr Sudesh Rathilal, Professor, Chemical Engineering, Green Engineering Research Group and Dr Emmanuel Kweinor Tetteh, Assistant Professor/Research Fellow, Green Engineering Research Group.\nNontobeko Ngcobo",
