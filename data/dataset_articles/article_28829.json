According to Anthropocene , researchers have created a simple three ingredient film made from common food waste that rivals and in some cases even beats conventional plastic. The invention blends cellulose from wood pulp with chitin from crustacean shells or mushrooms and adds citric acid, then joins these ingredients through cross linking. This process creates a tight natural network that resists swelling in high humidity, which has long been a challenge for biopolymers.\nThe team has spent a decade trying to find a plant based alternative to petroleum plastic that still protects food. Their latest work builds on that effort by producing a thin film that remains strong and effective even at humidity levels similar to tropical regions. Tests show that at eighty percent humidity the new biobased sheet was less permeable to oxygen than some standard plastic packaging such as EVOH, which is widely used to cover fresh produce. This matters because oxygen exposure accelerates food spoilage, leading to unnecessary waste and more pressure on the planet .\nThe scientists also found that the film performed almost as well as PET when it came to resisting water vapor. PET dominates food packaging today, yet it lingers in the environment for centuries and endangers wildlife and other animals . In contrast, the new material uses ingredients that are abundant in nature and expected to break down without leaving lasting Pollution . Their study, published in ACS Applied Polymer Materials , shows that this innovation is far more resistant to oxygen than other bioplastics like polylactic acid or cellulose acetate.\nThere is still more to learn about how quickly the film biodegrades, but its reliance on food waste streams could help cut emissions, limit plastic Pollution , and Support more vegan and plant-based choices in food systems. Small changes like choosing sustainable packaging help protect the environment and Support a healthier future for all species.\nReaders can stay informed and Support companies investing in responsible materials that avoid plastic and protect the planet.\nBeing publicly-funded gives us a greater chance to continue providing you with high-quality content.
