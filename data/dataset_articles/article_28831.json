  "text": "Fire department welcomes arrival new brush trucks\nThe Hawaii Fire Department welcomed the arrival of three new brush trucks with a blessing held Monday, Nov. 17, in Hilo.\nThe blessing was conducted by Fire Chaplain Renee Godoy.\nADVERTISING\nThe Ford F-450 brush trucks, funded by the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, will be assigned to volunteer fire stations in Hawaiian Acres, Na‘alehu and Discovery Harbour.\nThe brush trucks replace aging vehicles that have been in service for up to 45 years and are critical for responding to brush, residential and vehicle fires in remote and rural areas of upper Puna and Ka‘u.\n“These new brush trucks are made possible through thoughtful investment and partnerships across our County,” Mayor Kimo Alameda said in a press release. “By leveraging these funds, we’re able to strengthen community safety and ensure that our volunteer firefighters have the resources they need to protect our island.”\nIn total, the three brush trucks cost approximately $625,693.\n“These vehicles will allow our volunteer firefighters to meet national safety standards, respond faster, and operate more safely in rugged and remote terrain,” Fire Chief Kazuo Todd said in the press release. “Mahalo to the CDBG Program for supporting this essential investment in emergency response.”\nThe Office of Housing and Community Development administers the county’s CDBG Program and worked closely with the fire department to make this purchase possible.\nThe CDBG Program is federally funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and supports a wide range of community development activities, with a focus on improving housing, public facilities and public services for low- and moderate-income persons.",
