  "text": "Paris-based Spark Cleantech has closed a €30 million\nSeries A funding round (including €17 million in equity). The round was led by\n360 Capital and Taranis, with participation from the Île-de-France\nReindustrialisation Fund (initiated by the Île-de-France Region and operated by\nInnovacom), alongside Asterion Ventures, the company’s long-standing investor.\nFounded in 2022 in the laboratories of\nCentraleSupélec by Erwan Pannier and Patrick Peters, Spark Cleantech is a\ndeeptech company focused on decarbonising heavy industries such as glassmaking,\nmetallurgy, polymers, and batteries.\nThe company has developed a patented process based on pulsed plasmolysis that replaces fossil-fuel combustion in high-temperature industrial furnaces and materials production with an alternative that is fully decarbonised, economically competitive, and requires minimal changes to existing operations.\nSpark Cleantech’s modules are installed between a client’s existing gas network and their high-temperature industrial burners. Using pulsed plasma, the technology removes carbon from the gas before combustion, leaving hydrogen as a fully decarbonised energy source. The extracted carbon is converted into a solid nanomaterial used in polymers and battery production, replacing a petroleum-derived material with a significantly higher carbon footprint.\nThis approach relies on proprietary pulsed plasmolysis technology, initially invented at Stanford University, further developed at CentraleSupélec, and industrialised by Spark Cleantech in France. It reduces the energy required for separation while generating a high-value carbon nanomaterial.\nIn practice, the process converts a hydrocarbon, without combustion, into two decarbonised materials, hydrogen and solid carbon, whose combined economic value is increased by a factor of four, while reducing emissions by up to 85 per cent. Spark Cleantech’s technology is currently being piloted with major customers in metallurgy, glassmaking, polymer production, and battery manufacturing.\nThe new investment will support Spark Cleantech’s next phase of growth, allowing the company to complete and operate its first production module before rolling it out across customer sites.\nIt will also fund the qualification of Spark Cleantech’s first commercial carbon grades, one of the two outputs of its pulsed plasmolysis process. In addition, the team will expand by around 20 new hires across commercial operations, engineering, and R&D.\n-\nWould you like to write the first comment?\nLogin to post comments",
