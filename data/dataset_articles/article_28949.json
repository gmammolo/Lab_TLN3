  "text": "New Delhi : KPI Green Energy Limited, one of India’s largest integrated renewable energy solution providers, has achieved a remarkable milestone by securing a landmark 142 MWp (DC) / 110 MW (AC) floating solar EPC contract from Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Limited (GSECL). The project, located at the reservoir of Kadana Dam in Mahisagar district, Gujarat, marks a major expansion of the company’s renewable energy capabilities into the high-potential floating solar segment.\nThe EPC contract covers complete design, engineering, procurement, construction and installation of the floating PV system, alongside grid-connection works that include a 33 kV underground transmission line to the pooling station and 33/220 kV bays at the Kadana substation.\n“Winning the 110 MW (AC) floating solar EPC contract from GSECL is a major milestone for KPI Green Energy Limited and the KP Group. It expands our portfolio into next-gen floating solar technology, reinforces our full-service EPC credentials, and underscores our commitment to driving India’s energy transition. We look forward to executing this project safely, on time, and to the highest quality standards.” Dr. Faruk G. Patel, Founder, Chairman and MD, KP Group\nThe project, which will be executed over 18 months, also includes a 10-year operations and maintenance component. KPI Green said the contract strengthens its position across ground-mounted, rooftop and now floating solar segments.\nThis marks a landmark contract for KPI Green Energy and underscores the Company’s growing leadership in large-scale renewable energy infrastructure. The floating solar project represents a strategic diversification for the company — combining solar power generation with innovative floating PV technology —and positions KPI Green Energy not only as a leading Power Producer in the segment but also as a premier EPC solutions provider across ground-mounted, rooftop, and now floating solar segments.",
