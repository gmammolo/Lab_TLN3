  "text": "AQI Emerges as the New Luxury Metric as HNIs & NRIs Turn to Clean-Air Living\nPTI\nReal journalism holds power accountable\nSince 2015, The Wire has done just that.\nBut we can continue only with your support.\nRam Rattan's Naugaon Becomes the Preferred Address for Health, Luxury, Slow Living and High-Growth Investment\nNEW DELHI, Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As Indian metros grapple with hazardous air quality, chronic traffic congestion, and mounting health risks, a transformative shift in luxury real estate is underway. For discerning HNIs, NRIs, and well-travelled families, Air Quality Index (AQI), green cover and sustainability have become defining parameters of premium living. This shift is steering a surge of interest toward destinations that promise cleaner air, more time, and a healthier lifestyle — and Ram Rattan's Naugaon has swiftly emerged as one of the most sought-after addresses in this new era.\nIn stark contrast, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida and surrounding NCR regions continue to record severe pollution levels year after year. Data from global health studies indicates that residents of Delhi are losing over 8 years of life expectancy due to prolonged exposure to polluted air — equivalent in many ways to the damage caused by chronic smoking. Families today increasingly associate metro living with asthma, cardiovascular stress, mental fatigue and reduced outdoor time for children, prompting an urgent re-evaluation of where and how they want to live.\nAQI, Time and Connectivity: The New Icons of Luxury for HNIs & NRIs\nLuxury buyers are no longer driven only by architecture or brand names. The elite home-buyer of today prioritises:\n• Clean air that supports a longer, healthier life\n• Large open spaces and natural surroundings\n• A slower pace of living that enhances mental wellbeing\n• Fast connectivity that returns hours of daily time lost in city traffic\n• A future-proof investment in a high-growth corridor\nThis evolving preference explains the robust demand for gated luxury farmhouse communities situated away from polluted urban clusters — especially those backed by established developers and strong infrastructure.\nRam Rattan's Naugaon: The New Destination for Families Seeking Health, Luxury and Growth\nSpread against the scenic backdrop of the Aravalli belt, Ram Rattan's Naugaon offers the rare combination of clean air, green landscapes, and seamless access to major economic hubs via the Delhi–Mumbai Expressway. It has quickly become the preferred choice for families who want slow living without compromising on connectivity or investment potential.\nWhat sets Naugaon apart is its master-planned ecosystem built around comfort, security and nature:\n• Markedly cleaner air and pollution-free surroundings\n• 1-bigha onwards luxury farmhouse plots ideal for personalised leisure or retirement homes\n• Gated living with 24×7 security and wide internal roads\n• Transparent purchase process and trust built over multiple delivered projects\n• Rising capital appreciation fueled by improved transport links and regional development\nFor buyers, Naugaon represents more than land — it represents longevity, peace of mind, and a return to nature-powered lifestyles.\nSuccessful Completion and Handover: Trust Built Through Delivery\nRam Rattan Group's reputation is anchored in its consistent track record of delivering high-quality, clean-air lifestyle communities. Over the years, the Group has successfully completed and handed over several marquee projects, reinforcing buyer confidence and demonstrating long-term commitment to the region:\n• Green Step Farms Phase I — Fully delivered with physical possession completed\n• Green Step Farms Phase II — Ongoing with strong buyer interest\n• Ananda Farms — Fully delivered with CLUs obtained, setting a benchmark for compliant and nature-led development\n• Golden Age Isvara Farms— A premium lifestyle farmland community delivered by the Ram Rattan Group\n• Aravalli Retreat — Another successfully delivered signature project that blends luxury living with pristine natural surroundings\nEach delivered project strengthens the Group's credibility and highlights its capability to develop secure, sustainable, and legally clear farmland estates. This robust delivery history has played a pivotal role in positioning Naugaon as one of the most trustworthy and high-growth investment zones in the region — ideal for both weekend living today and full-time living tomorrow.\nA New Lifestyle for the New India\nFor many HNI and NRI families, Naugaon symbolizes a shift towards:\n• Health over pollution\n• Time over traffic\n• Space over congestion\n• Long-term value over short-term convenience\nNaugaon is increasingly being seen as a perfect setting for families who want their children to grow up close to nature, for professionals seeking weekend solace, and for investors securing early entry into an appreciating micro-market.\n\"Luxury today is defined by the quality of air you breathe and the peace your home gives you,\" says Vijay Ram Rattan, Chairman, Ram Rattan Group. \"With Naugaon, we have created a destination where families can find health, luxury, slow living and long-term growth — all in one integrated community.\"\nAs metros continue to struggle with life-threatening AQI levels, the demand for healthier, greener living environments grows stronger. With its clean-air advantage, modern infrastructure and a philosophy grounded in wellbeing, Ram Rattan's Naugaon stands out as the new benchmark for the future of luxury living in India.\nMedia Contact\nRam Rattan Group\nPhone: 91 9910888324\nEmail: enquiry@ramrattangroup.com\nWebsite: www.ramrattangroup.com\n(Disclaimer: The above press release comes to you under an arrangement with PRNewswire and PTI takes no editorial responsibility for the same.).
