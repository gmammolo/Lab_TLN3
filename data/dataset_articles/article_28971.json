  "text": "IndiaPosted at: Dec 4 2025 3:34PM PM Modi highlights success of Cheetah Reintroduction Program on International Cheetah DayNew Delhi, Dec 4 (UNI) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday shared an article written by union Minister Bhupender Yadav, emphasising the government's commitment to wildlife conservation through the cheetah reintroduction program. Marking International Cheetah Day, PM Modi also expressed optimism about the growing cheetah population in India, calling it a \"strong proof\" of the species' successful adaptation to the Indian environment. \"The birth of five cubs by a female cheetah born in India is strong proof that cheetahs have fully adapted to the Indian environment,\" the Prime Minister stated, highlighting a key milestone in the program’s progress. In a message posted on X (formerly Twitter), PM Modi extended his greetings to wildlife lovers and conservationists dedicated to protecting the cheetah, describing the initiative as a significant step toward ecological restoration. \"Three years ago, our Government launched Project Cheetah with the aim of safeguarding this magnificent animal and restoring the ecosystem in which it can truly flourish. It was also an effort to revive lost ecological heritage and strengthen our biodiversity,\" he said. The cheetah reintroduction program, initiated in 2020, aimed at reestablishing the species in its historic habitats, reversing decades of decline and local extinction. The project not only focuses on the survival of cheetahs but also on enhancing the overall ecological balance and biodiversity of the region. Union Minister Bhupender Yadav’s article, shared by the Prime Minister, underscored the government’s sustained efforts and scientific approach in ensuring the thriving future of the cheetah in India’s wild landscapes. The government's conservation efforts stand as a beacon of hope for wildlife preservation, inspiring further action among citizens and environmentalists alike.
