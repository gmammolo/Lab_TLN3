  "text": "KNOX – Due to the extreme winter conditions that will be affecting the area, Mayor Dennis Estok would like to remind residents to take extra care in protecting their pets during these conditions.\nIn a press release from the Mayor shared December 3rd, it states:\n“Every responsible pet owner should be vigilant in making sure that their pets are protected from the elements in a structure meeting the minimum veterinary standards for protection from the elements. Pets should be able to stand, sit and lie down without restrictions in a safe and sanitary manner and have sufficient food and water at all times.\nAs a reminder, under Ordinance 1087, the City of Knox does have the right to enforce the humane treatment of animals. If pet owners are found to be in violation of the terms of this Ordinance, citations will be handed out accordingly and enforced.\nIf at all possible, pets should be brought inside or kept indoors during these extreme conditions.”",
