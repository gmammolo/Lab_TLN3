  "text": "Council and Parliament strike a deal on rules to phase out Russian gas imports for an energy secure and independent Europe\nEuropean Council / Council of the European Union\nCouncil of the EU\nPress release\n3 December 2025 01:43\nToday, the Council presidency and the European Parliament's representatives reached a provisional agreement on the regulation to phase out imports of Russian natural gas. The regulation constitutes a central element of the EU's REPowerEU roadmap to end dependency on Russian energy following Russia's weaponisation of gas supplies with significant effects on the European energy market.\nThe regulation introduces a legally binding, stepwise prohibition on both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas imports from Russia, with a full ban from the end of 2026 and autumn 2027 respectively. It will contribute to the overarching goal of achieving a resilient and independent EU energy market, while preserving the EU's security of supply.\nThis is a big win for us and for all of Europe. We have to put an end to EU's dependence on Russian gas, and banning it in the EU permanently is a major step in the right direction. I am very pleased and proud that we have been able to reach an agreement with the European Parliament so quickly. It shows that we are committed to strengthening our security and safeguarding our energy supply.\n- Lars Aagaard, Denmark's minister for climate, energy and utilities\nMain elements of the agreement\nTransition phase for existing supply contracts\nThe co-legislators confirmed that imports of Russian pipeline gas and LNG will be prohibited from six weeks after entry into force of the regulation, while maintaining a transition period for existing contracts. In particular:\n- for short-term supply contracts concluded before 17 June 2025, the prohibition of Russian gas imports will apply from 25 April 2026 for LNG and 17 June 2026 for pipeline gas\n- for long-term contracts for LNG imports, the prohibition will apply from 1 January 2027, in line with the 19th sanctions package\n- as regards long-term contracts for pipeline gas imports, the prohibition will kick in on 30 September 2027, provided that member states are on track to fulfil the storage filling targets foreseen in the gas storage regulation, and at the latest on 1 November 2027\nAmendments to existing contracts will be permitted only for narrowly defined operational purposes and cannot lead to increased volumes.\nCustoms procedures and authorisation\nThe co-legislators included the requirement that both categories of gas imports be subject to a prior authorisation regime in order to ensure that the prohibition will work in practice.\n- for Russian gas and those imports falling under the transition period, the information required for authorisation must be submitted at least one month before entry\n- for non-Russian gas, the proof must be provided at least five days before entry and 7 days for gas imported via the Strandzha 1 interconnection point\nIn order to reduce the administrative burden, the co-legislators agreed that this prior authorisation procedure would not apply to imports from countries that fulfil certain criteria, such as major gas-producing countries that exported more than 5 bcm of natural gas to the EU in 2024, and that either prohibit or restrict imports of Russian gas, or countries without any infrastructure to import.Based on ongoing monitoring by customs and authorising authorities, the Commission can update the list of exempted countries and, if necessary, may remove countries from the list, e.g. in case of documented circumvention.\nNational diversification plans\nThe regulation mandates all member states to submit national diversification plans outlining measures for diversifying their gas supplies and potential challenges, with a view to ending all gas imports from Russia by in time with the deadlines foreseen in the regulation. At the same time, the agreement strengthens the Commission's oversight by requiring member states to notify the Commission within one month of the regulation's entry into force whether they have Russian gas supply contracts or national legal bans in place.\nThe same requirement to submit a national diversification plan will apply to those member states that are still importing Russian oil, with a view to discontinuing those imports. The regulation will be accompanied by a Commission's statement on the intention to put forward a legislative proposal on phasing out Russian oil imports to the EU no later than end of 2027.\nOther elements\nCompared to the Commission's proposal, the co-legislators introduced provisions for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for failure to comply with the measures set out in the regulation, including a maximum threshold for penalties both for companies and private individuals.\nThe Council and the Parliament maintained the suspension clause, which provides the possibility to temporarily suspend the application of the regulation in the case of sudden developments threatening the security of energy supply of one or more member states. Specifically, the co-legislators agreed to tighten the conditions for the Commission to trigger the temporary lifting of the import prohibition, based on a strict necessity, the state of emergency as declared by a member state and only for a limited period and covering short-term supply contracts.\nIn order to assess the impact of the regulation, the co-legislators also required the Commission to review the implementation of the regulation within two years of its entry into force, including the provisions on the prior authorisation procedures.\nNext steps\nThe provisional agreement will now be endorsed by the Council and the Parliament before being formally adopted.\nBackground\nFollowing Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, EU leaders agreed, in the Versailles Declaration of March 2022, to phase out dependency on Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.\nConsequently,gas and oil imports from Russia to the EU have both decreased significantly in recent years. However, while imports of oil have dropped to below 3% in 2025 thanks to the current sanctions regime, Russian gas still accounts for an estimated 13% of EU imports in 2025, worth over â¬15 billion annually. This leaves the EU exposed to significant risks in terms of its trade and energy security.\n|\nNEWSLETTER\n|\n| Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list |\n|\n|\n|",
