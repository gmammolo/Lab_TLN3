  "text": "Rabat – Moroccan phosphate giant OCP Group has signed a new five-year renewable Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the group announced yesterday.\nThe agreement aims to support agricultural transformation, low-carbon industrial development, digital innovation, and skills training in Africa and around the world.\nThe new MoU strengthens and expands the long partnership between the two organizations, according to the statement. It brings together UNIDO’s mission to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development and OCP’s strong expertise in plant nutrition, industrial operations, and innovation.\nUnder the agreement, OCP Group and UNIDO will work together to develop stronger agricultural value chains and agribusiness, support the production of green hydrogen and green ammonia, and promote the decarbonization of industrial processes.\nIt also aims to advance Industry 4.0 and Artificial Intelligence solutions, as well as develop smart and sustainable industrial parks.\nUNIDO is a specialized United Nations agency that works to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development. It supports its 173 member states through technical cooperation, policy advice, standards development, and international partnerships.\nThe agency focuses on ending hunger through stronger food systems, fighting climate change with renewable energy and energy-efficient industry, and ensuring fair and sustainable global supply chains.\nHanane Mourchid, OCP Group’s Chief Sustainability & Innovation Officer, said the partnership with UNIDO will help speed up agricultural transformation and low-carbon industrial growth.\n“Leveraging UNIDO’s convening role and our shared ambition, we aim to foster resilient, inclusive growth that benefits farmers, communities, and the planet,” she added.\nUNIDO Director General Gerd Müller spoke about the importance of strong food systems, innovation, and cooperation with the private sector.\nHe said the partnership with OCP will help advance green industrial solutions, support climate-resilient agriculture, and create more opportunities for young people in Africa and beyond.\nThe signing of the MoU marks a new chapter in the OCP-UNIDO partnership and reinforces their shared commitment to sustainability, innovation, and inclusive growth, concluded the statement.",
