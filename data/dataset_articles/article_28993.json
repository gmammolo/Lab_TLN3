WEST ODESSA — When Paula Graham’s family moved here to chase the oil boom in the 1980s, this unincorporated portion of Ector County was scarcely populated. Roads were barely paved. There was no running water.\nIn the decades since, the lonely stretch of roads is now full of other trailer homes. Despite the boom, there is still no access to clean and reliable drinking water.\nFamilies like Graham’s rely on wells and pump systems they’ve installed and must maintain themselves. She fears the increased population is straining her well and that it will dry up.\nFor the last four years, Graham has asked the local water utility about adding lines from nearby Odessa, with little luck. Until now.\nGraham is cautiously optimistic about a new $17 million project paid for by the Texas Legislature to expand water infrastructure in West Odessa. The utility district could “stop short” of her house, she said.\nThe one-time state investment offers another reminder that scores of Texans still lack access to running water — and the staggering costs local governments face building and maintaining those systems. Most Texans without running water typically live outside municipal boundaries, like West Odessa or colonias along the border.\nThe Best of the Tribune in your Inbox The Y’all is a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies that define the state of Texas.
