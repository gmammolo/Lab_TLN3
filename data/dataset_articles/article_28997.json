  "text": "Bangkok, Thailand — Following the recent severe flooding that impacted communities across the southern region of Thailand, Nissan Thailand today donated 150,000 THB to the Thai Red Cross Foundation. In addition to this corporate contribution, Nissan employees have also joined hands to raise additional funds and donate essential relief items. These donated goods were delivered through Bang Sao Thong District to assist flood-affected communities. The company is also actively providing assistance to impacted dealers and their employees.\nTakaaki Yanagi, Senior Vice President, Nissan Thailand stated: “Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the floods, we stand with the Thai people during this recovery period. Through our support to the Thai Red Cross Foundation and donation from our employees, we hope to contribute to long-term recovery and help communities during this difficult time.”\nThe Thai Red Cross Foundation will utilize the donation to provide essential resources and assistance for rehabilitation and rebuilding in flood-affected areas.\nMeanwhile, Nissan continues its “Nissan Cares: Flood Relief Support Campaign” to help Nissan’s owners whose cars impacted by flood. The campaign, which runs until December 31, 2025, offers a 30% discount on parts, chemicals, lubricants, and decorative items damaged in the flood to help customers restore their vehicles.\n# # #\nFor more information about our products, services and commitment to sustainable mobility, visit nissan-global.com.
