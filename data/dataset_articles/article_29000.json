In 2011 alone, for example, there were 13 large-scale seizures of ivory, and over 23 tons of ivory confiscated, which is equivalent to at least 2,500 elephants.

A 2010 United Nations report suggests that gorillas could disappear altogether from large parts of the Congo Basin by the mid-2020s.\nAnd it is not just the animals that are suffering.

And once it’s gone, it cannot be replenished. Those who profit from it illegally are not just undermining our borders and our economies, they are truly stealing from the next generation,” she said.\nHow to Celebrate World Wildlife Conservation Day\nRaise awareness and contribute to the conservation and protection of endangered species such as elephants, rhinos and tigers on World Wildlife Conservation Day’s website.\nThis global occasion provides everyone with the opportunity to learn more about wildlife conservation and to be part of the solution to wildlife crime.
