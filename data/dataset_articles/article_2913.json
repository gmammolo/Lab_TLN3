  "text": "UNION, Ky. (WKRC) — A tragic collision at the intersection of U.S. 42 and Beaver Road in Boone County on Tuesday has left two women dead and another critically injured.\nThe incident has reignited longstanding concerns about the safety of the intersection, which has been the site of numerous crashes over the years.\nThe crash occurred when a fully loaded Mack dump truck, carrying 80,000 pounds of cargo, collided with a Chevy Malibu turning onto the highway.\nThe impact killed 91-year-old Eva Mulberry of Williamstown, Kentucky, and 89-year-old Betty Hillard of Lexington, Kentucky. The driver of the Malibu, 66-year-old Rhonda Wright from Corinth, was hospitalized in critical condition with life-threatening injuries. The truck driver sustained minor injuries and was treated and released.\nThe dump truck also crashed into the Boonedocks Pub and Grub, causing damage but no injuries inside the establishment. Co-owner Melissa Schneider-Kroth expressed relief that no one inside was hurt but emphasized the need for changes at the intersection.\nShe noted that trucks carrying gravel from nearby quarries and gravel businesses routinely come down the hill and then need to go back up another hill through the intersection, with authorities also warning about low visibility when trying to turn onto the highway from Beaver Road.\n\"There are numerous crashes that have happen out here just since we've owned the building, and what does need to change isn't going to just be taking a stoplight because it is hard for those trucks to come down, or the speed limit needs to be lowered,\" Schneider-Kroth said.\nBoone County Sheriff's spokesman Phillip Ridgell stated that initial investigations indicated that speed wasn't a factor in the crash.\nHe noted that there have been 24 collisions at this location over the past five years, with 14 resulting in injuries, though none were previously fatal. Crashes on U.S. 42 outside Florence account for 8.1% of all crashes in Boone County during that time.\n\"What else can the sheriff's office do to make that intersection safe?\" Local 12 said.\n\"Yeah, so most simplistically, our visibility in the area. I fully suspect that cruisers, both marked and unmarked, will be seen,\" Ridgell said. \"When you have something like this, it certainly warrants that. When a truck that is that large is going even the speed limit but coming down a hill, it needs significantly more space in order to apply the brakes before it comes to a complete stop or can safely avoid something in the roadway. There just wasn't enough space yesterday.\"\nAny changes to the intersection would need to be approved by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), and then it can only be done after an extensive traffic study.\nKYTC declined to make anyone available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said:\n\"Yesterday’s crash is tragic, and our hearts go out to those involved and their loved ones. Team Kentucky prioritizes safety for all roadway users, and Transportation Cabinet staff routinely review crash data to guide safety improvements. The intersection of U.S. 42 and Beaver Road (KY 338) has been reviewed by engineers in the past, and multiple improvements were made, including the relocation of intersection warning beacons with reflective backplates to optimize visibility, oversized stop signs, clearing the right of way last summer to improve sight distance, and high-friction surface treatment on U.S. 42 that is shown to reduce wet crashes by 83% and total crashes by 57%, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n\"A speed study was performed on U.S. 42, and the data indicated a 55 miles-per-hour speed is appropriate for this rural section of roadway. The Transportation Cabinet will continue to study future safety needs, including performing a traffic signal study that has been requested by Boone County Judge/Executive Gary W. Moore.\"\nThe owners of Boonedocks said that they don't know when they'll reopen but are thankful to area residents who have stepped up to help, including some bar regulars who have donated time and building materials to cover up and rebuild where the truck crashed into the building.",
