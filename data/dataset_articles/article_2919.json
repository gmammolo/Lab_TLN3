  "text": "Sunday’s cool weather helped prevent a tragedy when a child younger than 5 was left in a vehicle for approximately five hours, according to Jackie Zimmerman, public relations specialist for the Lufkin Police Department.\nLufkin police were called to the 100 block of North Timberland Drive around 12:30 p.m. Sunday on a report of a child left in a vehicle. The officers could not get the child to respond to knocks on the window, so they broke the driver’s side window and removed the child, Zimmerman said.",
