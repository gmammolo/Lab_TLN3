He is being held at the Cole County Jail without bond. An arraignment was held Wednesday afternoon.\nThe probable cause statement says that police were called to a business around 2:40 p.m. at 128 East High Street for a weapons offense. The victim in the case is the owner of the business, who claimed Chenet came to pick up a purse that was left by Chenet’s boss, the statement says.\nThe victim opened the purse to identify the owner and Chenet allegedly became angry, but the victim claimed he felt obligated to give the purse directly to the owner, the statement says.
