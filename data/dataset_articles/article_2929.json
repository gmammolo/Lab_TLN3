(WMTV) - The Pardeeville man accused of killing a woman who was planning to leave him was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday, court records show.\nLarry Manthe will be eligible to apply for extended supervision in 20 years. At that time, he will be 100 years old.\nManthe, 80, was found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide in January after a jury trial.\nManthe was arrested in September 2023, almost a year after the death of Alice Langer. She was 76 years old.\nOfficials previously reported that on Oct. 6, 2022, Langer’s family members called the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office concerned that they had not heard from her for 15 hours. After responding to her home, officers found Langer with a gunshot wound to the head.\nThe sheriff’s office said Manthe and Langer were living together and in a long-term relationship. Langer was planning to end the relationship and move out of the home, according to authorities.\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 WMTV.
