  "text": "Reuters\nFILE PHOTO: The U.S. flag, a judge gavel and a vintage scale are seen in this illustration taken August 6, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday asked a judge to drop a gun charge against a man Attorney General Pam Bondi last month called a leader of the MS-13 gang in the U.S., a court filing showed.\nBondi announced the arrest of a person she called one of the gang's top three leaders in a March 27 press conference, without naming the defendant or detailing charges. Later that day, the man, Henry Josue Villatoro Santos, 24, appeared in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, to face charges of illegal gun possession by an alien.\nIn court papers, federal prosecutors said law enforcement officials \"observed indicia of MS-13 association\" while searching Villatoro's bedroom, after raiding his home and arresting him on an administrative immigration warrant. They made no other references to MS-13 and his alleged leadership role and brought no other criminal charges.\nProsecutors on Wednesday did not provide a reason for seeking to dismiss the case in a brief court filing. They moved to drop the charge \"without prejudice,\" meaning it could be brought again.\nA Justice Department spokesperson and a lawyer for Villatoro did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA federal judge previously ordered Villatoro to remain in jail to await trial.\nAt her March 27 press conference, Bondi said the man arrested would not be \"living in our country much longer.\"\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Scott Malone and Deepa Babington)\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters .\nRelated:\n10 Safest States in America Join the Conversation See Comments\nRead More",
