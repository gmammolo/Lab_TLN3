  "text": "A Virginia mother of five is living every parent’s worst nightmare. One of her sons, Alonzo Goffney, is dead. Another — the grandson she helped raise — suffered serious injuries in one of several major incidents reported in Spotsylvania this week. The Spotsylvania County community continues to mourn after Tuesday’s mass shooting on Olde Greenwich Circle that left three young men dead and three others hospitalized. Now, a new GoFundMe is shining a heartbreaking light on the family left behind. “My mother of five lost her youngest son, who was only 18, to gun violence,” wrote Dameron Miasja, who organized the fundraiser . “Also her grandson that she raised, 16, was shot in his face and chest and is in stable condition.” Spotsylvania County Sheriff’s officials say the shooting unfolded around 5:30 p.m. on April 8 and was tied to an illegal gun sale turned deadly robbery . Four suspects — including three teens — were arrested Wednesday. Among the dead: 18-year-old Chase Feaster and 18-year-old Goffney, both of Spotsylvania, and a 20-year-old whose name has not yet been confirmed. “This has been incredibly hard for my mom, me, our loved ones, and our community,” Goffney's family wrote. “We are doing everything we can to recover and find stability.” The GoFundMe was launched to help cover funeral costs, hospital bills, and other expenses as the family struggles to recover emotionally and financially. More than $5,000 had been raised by Wednesday afternoon, less than six hours after it was launched. “She was unable to even see her son,” Miasja wrote. “Her only wish is that ANY video is limited to posting as she has to keep seeing his body on social media.” The Spotsylvania County Sheriff’s Office is continuing to investigate the case. Three of the suspects remain jailed without bond, while a fourth — a 16-year-old hospitalized with a gunshot wound — will be taken into custody once discharged. The family said the tragedy has left them reeling, and they’re now facing a heartbreaking new reality. help support a mother at a tragic time! anything helps ❤️ we love you alonzo we miss you like crazy already we going up for you baby boy❤️ rest up ! https://gofund.me/55b77e02 Click here to view the GoFundMe campaign . \"Every donation, no matter how small, will make a huge difference,\" Misaja added. \"If you’re unable to donate, sharing this campaign with others would mean the world to us.
