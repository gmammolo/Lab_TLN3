  "text": "WYOMING, Mich. —\nFour businesses along 44th Street in Grandville and Wyoming were broken into overnight on April 6. While police cannot confirm a connection between all four, the business owners believe one man committed all four burglaries.\nThe businesses affected were Bricks Georgetown gas station in Grandville, Tacos El Cunado 44th St, Textures Hair Salon and Allure Nail Spa. All of these businesses are located in the same strip mall.\nLaura Britton is the manager at Bricks Georgetown, and said a man broke in and stole the cash from the register and expensive bottles of alcohol.\nSeen in the security camera photo below, the man is wearing bright yellow gym shoes and carrying a hammer. Britton said he used that hammer to break into the gas station.\n“It was just kind of a mess, and a lot of our customers were concerned and as well as the employees, but we're glad that it happened in the middle of the night when nobody was here, so that's our main thing,” Britton said.\nThe door is now boarded up, and Britton said someone came out to fix the cash drawers. She saw the security camera video from Textures Hair Salon and believes the same man who broke into their business broke into the salon.\n“She showed me her video. It looks like the same guy. I couldn't say for sure,” she said. “They probably had a little crime spree, but I know that they ran out through the back door when we got cameras back there, so I'm sure they'll catch them.”\nBritton said Bricks Georgetown appreciates their customers who shared concerns about the store.\n“The one thing is, our customers came in and went, ‘What the heck? They're messing with our Bricks,’” she said. “We're really glad that we have a lot of loyal customers. They're great people. They're all from the community around here, so and when anything happens, they're always on the lookout, letting us know about weird stuff.”\nFour miles down 44th Street in Wyoming, Lisa Rozema said her Textures Hair Salon was burglarized in thirty seconds.\n“He came in, was in and out in 30 seconds, ran out the back door,” she said.\nThe man, who smashed the glass door with a hammer, took about $150 from the cash register, similar to the other businesses in the strip mall and the gas station.\n“Exactly the same,” she said. “Yeah, went to the right, to the drawers, cleaned them out, and went out the back.”\nThe man is seen in the security camera footage below breaking the glass door, rushing in to take the cash and rushing out of frame.\nNext door, Jaden Marmol said he came into Tacos El Cunado 44th St. and saw the damage.\n“I was cleaning everything up after they busted the window,” he said.\nSeen here in stills from security camera footage, a man used a hammer to break the glass door, smashed the cash registers, and took the money.\nWith the amount of cash stolen, Marmol said it will be a \"little struggle\" for the family-owned restaurant, but they will get through it.\n“We want to thank the community for all their help. You know, the Wyoming police, because you know they're helping us out a lot,\" he said. “We lost a lot of money, but you know, things like this happen, stupid people, stupid decisions. Want to thank everybody for helping us out, still supporting our family-owned business.”\nAllure Nail Spa, at the end of the strip mall, said a man broke their door with a hammer, but when he went behind the counter and found no money, he left without taking anything.\nThe Wyoming Police Department cannot confirm the connection between the robberies in Wyoming and the one in Grandville, but they are investigating the break-ins in Wyoming.\nAnyone with information regarding this incident is asked to contact Wyoming Police\ndetectives at 616-530-7300 or Silent Observer at 616-774-2345; 1-866-774-2345; or silentobserver.org\nAnyone with information regarding the break-in at Bricks is asked to contact the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Department.",
