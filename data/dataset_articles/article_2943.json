  "text": "There was panic in Odigbo local government area of Ondo state following the shocking discovery of three headless bodies floating in a river along the Odigbo-Ore old Road.\nThe discovery was made Sunday when locals stumbled upon the decomposing bodies floating in the river, with some bodies logged at the riverbanks.\nEyewitness accounts stated that the victims were brutally murdered and dumped in the river by suspected kidnappers.\nOne man identified simply as Shileola, an immediate past youth leader of the community, expressed shock over the incident.\nHe said: “I was shocked when I first heard about it over the phone. I rushed to the scene, hoping to identify the victims through their clothing or any other means, but all efforts proved abortive.”\nHe speculated that the victims might have been killed elsewhere and their bodies dumped in the river, as no reports of missing persons have been recorded in the area so far.\nThe youth leader however, urged residents to remain vigilant and security-conscious in the wake of the incident.\nWhile as of the time of filing this report, the exact cause and those behind the gruesome death remains unknown in the community.\nIn his reaction, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ayanlade Olayinka, confirmed that some three bodies were recovered at a river in Odigbo.\nHe said immediately it was reported at the Ore Division, the DPO of that division moved a detective to the scene where the three bodies were recovered.",
