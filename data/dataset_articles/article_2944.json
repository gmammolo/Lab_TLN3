  "text": "WATERTOWN — A past City Council and city school district Board of Education candidate is charged with robbing a northside convenience store at knifepoint Tuesday.\nAaron R. Clemons, 47, of 126 Maywood Terrace, was charged by city police at about 4:15 p.m. Tuesday with first-degree robbery, fourth-degree grand larceny and third-degree criminal possession of a weapon.\nPolice allege that Clemons entered the Valero market, 701 Mill St., at about 12:30 p.m. Tuesday and threatened to kill a store clerk while holding the man at knifepoint before forcibly stealing between $500 and $600 from the cash register.\nPolice said it was illegal for him to possess the weapon because he had been convicted of third-degree falsely reporting an incident in December. In that instance, he had been accused in July of reporting an assault and robbery to police while knowing the information was false.\nClemons most recently ran for City Council as a write-in candidate in 2023. He also ran unsuccessfully on the ballot in 2019 and 2021. He also ran unsuccessfully for a school board seat in 2008.\nHe was arraigned Tuesday in Central Arraignment Part Court and ordered held at the Metro-Jefferson Public Safety Building on $75,000 bail.\nJohnson Newspapers 7.1",
