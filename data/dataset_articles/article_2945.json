  "text": "Grand Forks man sentenced to 25 years for attempted murder of police officers, other violent acts\nJeffrey Jacob Simpson Jr. was sentenced Wednesday afternoon, April 9. He has credit for 384 days served in custody.\nGRAND FORKS — A Grand Forks man was sentenced Wednesday, April 9, to 20 years in prison for the attempted murder of multiple law enforcement officers, and an additional five years for various, preceding domestic violence-related crimes.\nJeffrey Jacob Simpson Jr., 31, stood trial in March on seven felony charges. A jury found him guilty of all seven: four counts of Class A attempted murder and three counts of Class C felony reckless endangerment showing extreme indifference.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPrior to trial, Simpson pleaded guilty\nto Class B felony night burglary, Class C felony domestic violence causing serious bodily injury, two counts of Class C felony terrorizing with a dangerous weapon, Class C felony felonious restraint, Class A misdemeanor methamphetamine possession, Class A misdemeanor criminal mischief and Class B misdemeanor domestic violence causing bodily injury.\nCourt documents allege Simpson was brought to law enforcement's attention after his ex-girlfriend reported him for breaking into her home, strangling her, threatening to kill her while pressing a gun to her temple and underneath her chin, as well as causing other fear and physical harm.\nShe warned law enforcement that he had told her if she ever called the police on him, he would kill her and them, according to court statements.\nWith this concern in mind,\nlaw enforcement initiated a SWAT team to arrest Simpson while he was working in the 3300 block of Primrose Court on March 22, 2024.\nHowever, after they blocked his vehicle in,\nSimpson exited and began firing at law enforcement.\nHe was ultimately apprehended with no injuries sustained to any involved.\nIn a victim impact statement read by the prosecution, Simpson's ex-girlfriend relayed the months of unrelenting terror that was her relationship with Simpson, and how she and her family continue to be affected.\nShe detailed injuries she sustained, threats and terrorizing behavior and how she has had lasting anxiety, nightmares and fear.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"Despite the lasting effects Jeffrey has had on my life, for the past year, with Jeffrey being in jail, my life is slowly starting to come around,\" the woman wrote. \"... Me and my family are closer now than we have ever been before, and we feel safe knowing that Jeffrey is in jail and can't hurt me.\"\nShe wrote that the promises that Simpson made — to beat her, to shoot police — have all happened.\n\"Jeffrey has promised to kill me, and I beg that he is never allowed the opportunity to fulfill yet another promise,\" the woman wrote.\nSimpson's father, Jeffrey Simpson, asked the judge to consider his son's lack of criminal history and the fact that he was struggling with methamphetamine addiction at the time of the offenses.\n\"He is a good man,\" Jeffrey Simpson said. \"Just, along the way, he lost himself. This is why it's so important that we make sure that he doesn't get lost in the system, but gets the help he needs to succeed.\"\nThe prosecution asked that Jeffrey Simpson Jr. be sentenced to a total of 35 years for his crimes, while Simpson's attorney — David Ogren — requested 20 years with 10 suspended.\n\"Unfortunately — and I've learned this throughout the time of literally having done thousands of cases involving methamphetamine — there comes that point where it takes over,\" Ogren said. \"We have a man who had not previously had these issues, and very likely would have never had these issues hadn't meth raised its ugly head. Unfortunately, many, many people have fallen into that.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nJudge Jay Knudson acknowledged the statements about Simpson's addiction, but said they did not justify or excuse his criminal acts. He pointed out that Simpson's acts harmed many people, and he has never shown remorse for what he has done, particularly to his ex-girlfriend.\n\"You planned exactly what happened,\" Knudson said. \"You got what you asked for. I understand addiction is a problem, but a methamphetamine addiction is not an excuse to terrorize a girlfriend or shoot it out with law enforcement.\"\nHe sentenced Simpson to a total of 25 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised probation.\nSimpson has credit for 384 days served. He is prohibited from having contact with any of the victims in the case, and must complete a domestic violence assessment and related treatment if the assessment deems necessary.\nADVERTISEMENT",
