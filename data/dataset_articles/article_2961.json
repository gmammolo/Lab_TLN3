  "text": "This story contains mentions of child sexual abuse, read with with caution. DAYTON, Ohio ( WDTN ) – A Dayton attorney was sentenced to prison Wednesday for sex offenses involving a minor. Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney Mat Heck, Jr. announced that Christopher R. Six, Dayton, was sentenced to 3-4 ½ years in prison on Wednesday, April 9. “This defendant deserves every single day of his prison sentence,” said Heck. “Sexual predators who do these types of things should be locked up in prison where they cannot victimize any other children.” Six pleaded guilty on March 11 to 40 counts related to interactions with an underage girl from Las Vegas, Nevada. He had been indicted in October 2023 on 74 counts , including pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, disseminating matter harmful to juveniles and importuning His license to practice law was also suspended in October 2023. In March 2023, the Dayton Police Department received a referral from the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force for concerns about Six’s Snapchat account. Officials searched his electronics and online accounts and determined he had maintained contact with an underage minor in Nevada, both sending and requesting nude images. In his messages to the minor, Six discussed explicit fantasies. Their relationship continued until Snapchat shut down his account for containing child pornographic material.
