  "text": "Police search for man who bit tip of victim’s pinky off during Lawrence attack\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (KCTV) - Investigators are searching for a man who attempted to steal a liquor bottle before he attacked a man on a Lawrence street and bit the tip of his finger off.\nThe Lawrence, Kansas, Police Department has asked for the community’s help to identify the suspect following after multiple witnesses reported the incident.\nLaw enforcement officials said they were called to the area of 7th and Massachusetts St. around 1 a.m. on Sunday, March 29, with reports of the crime. Managers at a nearby bar reported the man walked out with a bottle of Fireball before they caught up with him outside and retrieved it.\nAs the suspect ran off, witnesses indicated that he bumped into a man walking past. As the bystander continued on, the suspect turned around and allegedly attacked him from behind before he proceeded to bite off the tip of the victim’s pinky.\nAnyone with information about who the man may be has been asked to report it to the Crime Stoppers Hotline at 785-843-TIPS. No further information has been released.\nCopyright 2025 KCTV. All rights reserved.",
