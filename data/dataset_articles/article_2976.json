  "text": "During a recent edition of his “Kliq This” podcast, WWE Hall of Famer Kevin Nash blasted WWE’s current booking of the Rhea Ripley vs. Bianca Belair vs. IYO SKY Women’s World Title match at WrestleMania 41.\nYou can check out some highlights from the podcast below:\nOn the choice to make the match a Triple Threat: “F***ing horrible in my estimation. I don’t want to see f***ing SKY and Bianca. I want to see Bianca and Rhea. I want to see Rhea and I don’t give a f**k who … she’s a f***ing star man.”\nOn why Adam Pearce should be fired: “Number one, I would fire the General Manager for putting Bianca as the referee and not having it be a no DQ match. That’s a stipulation right there. Bianca doesn’t want to wrestle Rhea, of course she’s going to f***ing [get involved]. I mean to put your babyface in that predicament, I don’t think that’s a good thing.”\nNOTE: If you have any news tips or podcast recaps that you’d like to send in for us to post (full credit will be given to you), please email me at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d98b9ab5b8abb2898e8a9980b8b1b6b6f7bab6b4).",
