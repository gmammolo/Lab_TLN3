  "text": "FREMONT — A second woman has died from injuries suffered in a two-alarm apartment building fire Sunday , authorities said Wednesday.\nThe coroner’s bureau identified her as Lori Long, 62, of Fremont. She died Tuesday at a hospital.\nShe was the second person to fall from the balcony of the fourth floor apartment where the fire started and where she lived, authorities said.\nAuthorities have not yet said how she knew the other woman already reported killed.\nManteca resident Charlotte Holguin, 54, who was visiting the apartment, died at the scene after plummeting from the balcony to the ground below.\nTwo other people suffered injuries, including a man who was able to get out of the burning apartment on his own and was in stable condition Wednesday. Another person injured has already been released from a hospital.\nThe cause of the fire remained under investigation Wednesday.\nThe fire erupted about 2:53 a.m. Sunday at the four-story, 30-unit Waterstone Apartments building at 3939 Bidwell Drive.\nFirefighters were on the scene within minutes and saw Holguin and another person hanging from the balcony. They both fell before firefighters could get a 35-foot ground ladder, the largest carried on a Fremont fire truck, to them. Authorities said the ability to use an aerial ladder on the truck was inhibited by obstructions in the parking lot. The fire was considered under control about 3:40 a.m.\nThe fire displaced dozens of residents.\nThe building was red-tagged by city officials, meaning it is not inhabitable.",
