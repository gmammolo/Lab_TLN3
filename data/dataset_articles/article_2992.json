  "text": "KALAMAZOO, MI -- Troy Leslie was sitting in his truck not far from the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission when he smelled smoke.\nA few seconds later, his Ford pickup truck was engulfed in flames.\n“I got my license back (reinstated), I got into that truck and now it’s gone,” Leslie said.\nLosing the truck he got four months ago is a massive setback for Leslie. He worked hard to save for the truck and was now saving for an apartment.\nOfficers responded to 448 N. Burdick St. just after 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, April 9, where the truck was fully engulfed in flames. Black smoke and large orange flames could be seen for several blocks.\nAfter the fire was extinguished, the entire front dash was melted. Most of the contents -- aside from a neon yellow pair of towing cables in the bed -- were destroyed.\n“I don’t know why (I should) even bother anymore,” Leslie said, sitting in another truck parked near the remains of his own.\nLeslie was sitting in the front seat of his truck smoking a cigarette when he noticed a smoky smell coming from the hood.\n“It smells like someone’s burning copper wire,” Leslie said he told his friend, Will.\nLeslie opened the hood and was met with bright orange flames. They tried to douse the flames with the sodas they were drinking. Leslie also tried to snuff out the flames with a blanket, he said.\nThe flames spread so fast, Leslie didn’t even have time to grab his wallet, which he’d left on the dash. Officers couldn’t find the wallet, which Leslie said was attached to a silver Harley Davidson keychain.\nLeslie was preparing to move into a new apartment, he said. In the truck’s bed, he had a new TV stand and coffee table as well as clothes he had ordered.\n“I wanted to be comfortable in my apartment when I moved in,” Leslie said. “I haven’t been blowing my money.”\nLeslie had also invested heavily in the truck itself, including installing a $300 stereo, he said.\nHe’s faced numerous setbacks in the process of saving, he said. At one point, his checking account was compromised, he said.\nLeslie said he’d been behind on his telephone bill and insurance payments, but had just paid off two payments for the truck.\nLeslie was taken to the hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation.\n“Every time I try to get ahead,” there’s another setback, Leslie said.",
