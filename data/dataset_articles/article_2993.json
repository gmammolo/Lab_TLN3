  "text": "Police were called to a domestic disturbance involving Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill and his wife Keeta Hill at the couple’s condominium in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida after Keeta’s mother made a call to authorities because she feared for her daughter’s safety.\nThe incident occurred on Monday and officers from the Sunny Isles Beach Police Department arrived just before 2 p.m., according to a police report obtained by Local 10 News.\nPolice were responding to a call of an “assault in progress,” according to the report, and Keeta’s mother, Alesia Vaccaro, described Hill as being “very aggressive and impulsive” when she spoke with responding officers.\n5 Tyreek Hill (l.) and wife Keeta (r.) at an EA Sports event in New Orleans on Feb. 7, 2025. Getty Images 5 Tyreek Hill (r.) and wife Keeta (l.) in February 2024. Getty Images Vaccaro also told authorities that she had witnessed Hill throw a laptop on the floor and grab the couple’s daughter before walking toward the balcony of the condo after Hill and Keeta had been arguing.\nHill told officers that the pair had started arguing after he returned from training and the two were discussing therapy, which saw things quickly escalate.\nThe football star had admitted to police that he grabbed the baby, but contested that “I have the same rights as a father as her as a mother, and I can take my baby whenever I want,” the report stated.\n5 Tyreek Hill’s wife Keeta. Instagram/keeta_vaccaro Keeta had told officers that the pair had been fighting more frequently and that he would get upset whenever she gave her opinion, and she stated that “he becomes angry and throws objects around.”\nShe also told officers that she was “in the process of filing for a divorce,” the report stated.\nThe Post confirmed she filed for a dissolution of marriage with children on Tuesday in Miami-Dade County Family Court\nBoth Hill and Keeta denied things had gotten physical, but police did observe a bruise on Keeta’s upper chest, which she told them could have happened unintentionally when Hill grabbed the baby from her.\nKeeta declined to provide a written statement and Hill left the condo without any arrests being made.\n5 Tyreek Hill’s wife Keeta with their daughter, Capri. Instagram/keeta_vaccaro “On Monday, we were informed that the police were called to Tyreek Hill’s home, and after conversations with Tyreek and members of his family, the police departed the residence without further incident and the case was closed,” the Dolphins said in a statement. “We have since been in communication with Tyreek and the NFL and will have no further comment on the matter.”\nThis is the latest off-field incident involving Hill.\nThe star receiver is being sued by OnlyFans model Sophie Hall for injuring her leg in 2023 during a backyard football lesson.\n5 Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Diamond Images/Getty Images Hill was also involved in a chaotic scene during a traffic stop just outside Hard Rock Stadium as he was driving to the Dolphins’ opener, which resulted in him getting handcuffed before he played in the game.\nThe couple themselves also had a bizarre instance where a divorce filing had been made on Hill’s behalf that he disputed and later fired his lawyer over.\nAnd the Monday incident was not the first time police had been called regarding a domestic dispute between Hill and Keeta, with authorities in Davie, Florida, responding to a similar call back on Jan. 22, 2024.\nHill and Keeta got married in November 2023 .",
