  "text": "GB News\nAlessandro Coatti had been travelling and conducting research in South America when police made the grisly discovery\nTrending on GB News\nThe dismembered body of a top London scientist has been found in a suitcase in Colombia, with police still searching for his torso.\nAlessandro Coatti, a 42-year-old molecular biologist who worked at the Royal Society of Biology (RSB) in London, was discovered murdered on the outskirts of Santa Marta.\nInvestigators confirmed that some of Coatti's remains were found in a black suitcase in the Caribbean port city.\nThe Italian national had been travelling and conducting research in South America after working in London for eight years.\nThe body of Alessandro Coatti was found in the Columbian city\nRSB/Getty\nSanta Marta's Mayor, Carlos Pinedo Cuello, has offered a reward of 50,000 Colombian pesos (£8,940) for information leading to the capture of those responsible.\nIn a statement posted on X, the mayor vowed: \"This crime will not go unpunished. The criminals must know that crime has no place in Santa Marta.\"\nHe pledged to pursue those responsible \"until they are brought to justice\".\nThe grim discovery was made on Sunday, according to investigators. Police are continuing their search for the remaining parts of Coatti's body.\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS\nThe Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia (file pic)\nGetty\nCoatti studied for a master's degree at University College London before joining the RSB. He spent eight years at the organisation, first as a science policy officer before being promoted to senior science policy officer.\nIn June 2022, he was among RSB representatives who appeared before parliament to discuss the future regulation of UK genetic technologies.\nCoatti left the RSB at the end of 2024 to volunteer in Ecuador and travel in South America.\nOn LinkedIn, he described being focused on \"ethical research and innovation topics, particularly in the animal and biomedical fields\".\nThe RSB said it was \"devastated\" by news of Coatti's death. A spokesman said: \"He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organising events and giving evidence in the House of Commons.\"\nColleagues described him as \"funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with\".\nThe RSB added: \"Ale will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him. Our thoughts and best wishes go out to his friends and family at this truly awful time.\"\nIn a 2022 interview, Coatti spoke of his \"passion for science\" and for \"community building and stakeholder engagement\".\nA hotel worker who spoke to Colombian newspaper El Tiempo said Coatti had inquired about visiting Minca, which is known for its organic coffee and varied birdlife.",
