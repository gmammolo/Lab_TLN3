  "text": "'We are going to see a change': Community leaders reflect on the work ahead to lower violence 'This is a situation that is so multifaceted. We understand we didn't get in this situation overnight, so we're not going to get out of it overnight,' Darren Faulkner said 'This is a situation that is so multifaceted. We understand we didn't get in this situation overnight, so we're not going to get out of it overnight,' Darren Faulkner said 'This is a situation that is so multifaceted. We understand we didn't get in this situation overnight, so we're not going to get out of it overnight,' Darren Faulkner said As Kansas City closes in on the record for the deadliest year yet, community leaders are reflecting on the work done to lower the violence rate. Darren Faulkner leads the KC 360 initiative, which works with city and community leaders to lower crime and violence levels. He said it’s hard to see such a devastating year but is reassured knowing the city is making big strides. \"I think if we focus on the negative, it could become very frustrating. But when we look at the number of people and organizations that are focused on this issue, it is a bright spot of hope that things won't always be as they've been,” Faulkner said. \"I want to encourage people to keep on holding on, to keep on believing that there is going to be a change.\" He says their work — from cleaning up trash in neighborhoods to door-to-door canvassing — is seeing results. While it may be time to lower the homicide rate, he said he is confident the city will get there. \"This is a situation that is so multifaceted. We understand we didn't get in this situation overnight, so we're not going to get out of it overnight,” Faulkner said. \"As long as we are working together in strategic alignment, we are going to see a change. I'm predicting that, and I'm going to be a person that will come back and say, I told you we could reduce violence in our city when it happens.\" Tommy Simmons lost his son Ahmad to gun violence in April. Now, he works with the KC 360 initiative and other anti-violence organizations to try to keep other families from going through what he did. \"We can't stop what happened in the past, but we can prevent what happens next,” Simmons said. He said he wants to see more people getting involved in these efforts. \"I want them to be more positive and get more involved in what's going on in their own community. You know, don't wait till it happens to you,” he said. Kansas City has tied the record for the deadliest year with 179 homicides. That’s the same number from 2020. Faulkner said on top of the fatal shootings, there have been 420 non-fatal shootings this year. He said getting those numbers lower is a key focus for KC360 in the next year.",
