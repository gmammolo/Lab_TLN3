  "text": "MOOREFIELD, W.Va. (WV News) – As the two teams entered the fourth and final period, the Keyser lead over Moorefield was slim, just six points, 33-27. In that final frame, however, Keyser’s Bibs Felton exploded for 10 of her game-high 26 points, and the Lady Tornado outscored Moorefield 22-9 to earn the 19-point, 55-36 victory.\nFelton led Keyser with 26 points in total, with Autumn Kerchner also scoring in double figures with 11 points. Next was Rooney Urice with six points, Makalya Gillaspie and Kiya Kesner with four points each, Austyn Healy with two points, and Carlee Staggs and Kiara Kesner one point each.\nIn the loss, Moorefield was led by Cici. Kump and Amber Williams with seven and six points respectively. Next was Jaden Cullers with five points, Sadie Crites with four points, and McKenna Crites, Korbin Keplinger, LeAnne Coon, and Sydney Rumer with three points apiece. Rounding out the scoring was Raleigh Kuykendall with two points.\nKeyser started fast, outscoring Moorefield 12-5 in the opening period to take a seven-point lead early. Autumn Kerchner led Keyser with seven of the Lady Tornado’s 11 points in the opener. Cici Kump and Korbin Keplinger led Moorefield in the frame with two points each.\nIn the second period, Keyser kept control, but only edged Moorefield by one point, 13-12. The result? An eight-point, 25-17 Keyser lead at the half. Bibs Felton led Keyser with eight points in the second stanza. Kump led Moorefield with five points.\nAfter the third period, Moorefield again played Keyser tight, actually edging the Black and Gold 10-8 to cut the Lady Tornado’s lead to just six points, 33-27, heading into the fourth and final frame. Jaden Cullers scored five of Moorefield’s 10 points in the third. Felton scored six of Keyser’s eight points.\nThen came the fourth quarter explosion with Felton scoring 10 points in the lid closer, and Keyser in general outscoring Moorefield 22-9 to blow things wide open in Keyser’s 19-point, 55-36 victory.\nKeyser (4-2) next hosts Hedgesville on Friday, Dec. 29, at 7:30 p.m.",
