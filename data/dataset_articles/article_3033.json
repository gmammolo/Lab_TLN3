  "text": "A “significant reduction in anti-social behaviour” has been reported in Christchurch .\nCommunity officers (CSAS) dealt with only five incidents of anti-social behaviour (ASB) in November.\nThis is compared to 23 ASB offences the previous month, 18 in September and 21 in August.\nCSAS officers also dealt with just two ‘youth ASB’ incidents in November, having responded to 15 in October.\nThe officers, introduced as part of a Community Safety Accredited Scheme, have been involved in active community engagement and interaction with businesses to educate them on reporting ASB and crime .\nDuring November, the CSAS officers took part in 81 business and public engagement events, compared to 20 the previous month.\nRead more: FOI reveals rise in number of homeless refugees in BCP Reduced levels of anti-social behaviour in the town have been attributed to the increased engagement.\nCSAS officers have also helped to tackle homelessness and safeguard children and adults in the town, as well as ensuring there is a patrol presence during events.\nIn November, they made seven referrals to homelessness charity St Mungo’s, and three to community mental health teams.\nHowever, there were no drug or alcohol-related offences dealt with by the officers, compared to 12 the previous month.\nChristchurch Town Council’s community committee met earlier this month to discuss the CSAS November report.\nRead more: Christchurch Medical Practice to close Burton surgery The minutes of the meeting read: “Members reviewed the CSAS November statistics and received a verbal presentation from the CSAS officer who explained her role in tackling anti-social behaviour and crime in Christchurch.\n“It was acknowledged that the data showed an increase in reporting and engagement levels culminating in a significant reduction in anti-social behaviour.\n“It was explained that the residents were wonderfully receptive to the presence of the CSAS Officer and that there had been a positive reaction within the community and the businesses.”\nMembers then heard more on the achievements and responsibilities of the CSAS officers, before acknowledging the “significant contribution” they made in “keeping the area safe and secure for the Christchurch community.”\nIt was then recommended that the council funds a CSAS officer for 2024/25.\nCrime Christchurch",
