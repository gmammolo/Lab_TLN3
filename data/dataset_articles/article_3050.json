  "text": "(Ottawa, Unceded Algonquin Territory, Ontario) – Assembly of First Nations (AFN) National Chief Cindy Woodhouse welcomed the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision to reject the Attorney General of Canada’s appeal in a class action lawsuit against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). This decision allows the class action to proceed seeking reparations for the harms experienced by First Nations individuals due to the misconduct of the RCMP in Yukon, Northwest Territories (NWT), and Nunavut.\n“First Nations have experienced threats, violence, and discrimination when interacting with the RCMP,” said National Chief Woodhouse. “We believe that a class action lawsuit of this nature is a critical step to acknowledging the plaintiffs as they unite as a powerful force of change, hopefully leading to long-term reform within the RCMP.”\nThe class action initiated by lead plaintiff Joe David Nasogaluak of Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, seeks $500 million in damages and $100 million in punitive damages from the federal government.\n“Although no amount of money can compensate for the harms First Nations have experienced, this lawsuit represents an acknowledgment of the systemic failures and their impact on our communities,” said National Chief Woodhouse. “It’s a step towards recognizing past wrongs, taking concrete steps towards healing, and repairing the troubled, long-standing relationship between the RCMP and First Nations.”\nThe Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is a national advocacy organization that works to advance the collective aspirations of First Nations individuals and communities across Canada on matters of national or international nature and concern.
