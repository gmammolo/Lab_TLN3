  "text": "Mayor Eric Adams, an avowed booster of New York City’s nightlife scene, is dismantling a decades-old, multiagency enforcement task force that has long been accused of using heavy-handed tactics during inspections at bars and venues across the Big Apple.\nThe so-called MARCH task force, which has comprised the NYPD, the Department of Buildings, the FDNY, the State Liquor Authority and other agencies, will be replaced by a new initiative called CURE — Coordinating a United Resolution with Establishments — that’s going to focus on “compliance and education, not overenforcement,” Adams told reporters Thursday.\n“This is an era of no more demonizing successful businesses, but promoting, lifting them up,” Adams said during a press conference at the Paragon nightclub in Bushwick, Brooklyn. “We want to continue to be the city that never sleeps.”\nThe NYPD-led MARCH initiative, which was launched by Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s, has drawn the ire of nightlife establishment owners for decades over its SWAT team-like surprise raids during peak business hours in response to noise complaints, health code violations and other community grievances. The raids resulted in either fines or mandatory closures of nightlife spots.\n“It was a very frustrating and confusing process,” said John Barclay, Paragon’s owner, who was subjected to MARCH raids at other establishments he’s operated.\nCURE, by contrast, will not have such raids be part of its regular operations, according to City Hall.\n Rather, it’ll require police precincts to establish direct lines of communication with bar and restaurant owners and inform them of any suspected violations at their establishments, including noise complaints. Owners will then have 30 days to address any infractions, according to City Hall.\n“The only venues who can expect to see significant enforcement actions are those that intentionally ignore community concerns,” said NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, the city’s highest-ranking uniformed cop.\n“We have other things to do in the city than to chase business owners around,” Maddrey added. “We want to take care of real crime.”\nAnother shakeup is that the CURE effort won’t be spearheaded by the NYPD. Instead it’ll be overseen by Office of Nightlife Executive Director Jeffrey Garcia, the city’s so-called “nightlife mayor,” who was tapped for his paid gig last month despite a hiring freeze enacted by Adams across all municipal agencies due to budgetary concerns.\n...continued swipe to next page « 1 2 » View full story\n©2023 New York Daily News.
