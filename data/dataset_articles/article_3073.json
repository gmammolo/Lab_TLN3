  "text": "About 200 people gathered for a vigil in Texas on Thursday evening to pay tribute to Savanah Soto , the pregnant teen who was murdered along with her boyfriend shortly before Christmas. Dozens of residents, dressed in pink T-shirts featuring Soto's picture, visited Kenwood Park near downtown San Antonio for the vigil, where many exchanged hugs and tears as they remembered the 18-year-old mom-to-be. \"She was the princess of the family,\" Maria, who declined to give her last name but says she was close to the family, told The Messenger while at the vigil. \"It hurts.\" \"And, she’s the only girl in the family, so it hurts even more,\" the 30-year-old, dressed in white jeans and a pink sweater, added. Soto and her boyfriend, Matthew Guerra , were found shot dead in a Silver Kia parked near an apartment complex on Tuesday. Authorities believe their bodies may have been there for several days. The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office told The Messenger that both Soto and Guerra died from gunshot wounds to the head. \"She was meant to be a mom,\" Joanie Wasil, sister-in-law to Soto, told The Messenger on Thursday. \"She was so loving with all her nieces and nephews.\" \"I want people to know that this isn’t how I’m going to remember her,\" she explained. \"I’m going to remember the caring, loving, crazy Vanah we all knew.\" Soto grew up with seven brothers, Maria said, and was \"a tomboy at heart\" and a \"beautiful young girl.\" \"Gloria raised wonderful children,\" Maria told The Messenger. \"She is an amazing mother. Her children are watching over her and her siblings.\" \"Justice means bringing everyone accountable for what acts took place,\" she continued. \"May not be today, may not be tomorrow, but in a matter of time.\" It's believed that Soto may have been preparing to head to a local hospital for an appointment before she was killed, according to her mother, Gloria Cordova. She was scheduled to be induced into labor to deliver her son, Fabian, that Saturday. While speaking about Soto, Wasil said that the vigil would have been \"exactly\" what she would have wanted. \"She’d be very, very happy so many people are showing love,\" Wasil told The Messenger. \"I know she’s happy her family is all together.\" She said Soto's mother is \"just trying to be strong for everyone\" and is \"hanging in there as much as she can for the rest of the family.\" Police are now asking for help identifying two people filmed on a surveillance camera interacting with someone inside the car that belonged to Guerra. San Antonio police shared the footage on Facebook and X on Thursday. \"It’s a step closer,\" Wasil said. \"We’re getting closer to who actually did this. We’re going to get justice for Vanah.\"",
