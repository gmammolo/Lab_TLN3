  "text": "Two young brothers who were the subject of an Endangered Missing Alert have been located in Oklahoma and are safe, the Sterling Police Department announced Thursday.\nThe SPD and Colorado Bureau of Investigation issued an alert for Zuryah Thalacker, 4, and 23-month-old Ansom Thalacker around 1:15 p.m. Thursday. According to the alert, they had last been seen around 1:30 p.m. Wednesday near the intersection of Platte Street and King Court in Sterling, and were believed to be with 28-year-old Justina Lambert.\nThe alert was deactivated less than two hours later, just after 3 p.m., and the SPD released additional information on the incident.\n“On Dec. 27, 2023, Sterling Police Department officers assisted the Logan County Department of Human Services in attempting to serve a court order to remove two young children from their parents as part of an ongoing investigation by DHS into unsafe living conditions,” the release states. “However, the children’s mother, identified as Justina Lambert, had apparently taken the children and fled the area prior to contact.”\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Lambert after the children went missing, and police put out a “bolo” (Be On the Lookout) for the 2007 white Nissan Murano she was believed to be driving while searching local places Lambert was known to frequent.\nAccording to the SPD, on Thursday they received “credible information” Lambert had left the state. After the missing persons alert went out, additional tips confirmed Lambert was no longer in Colorado.\n“Investigators located Lambert and the children in Enid, Oklahoma, where they were found to be safe and are now in the custody of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services,” the release states.\nLambert may face additional charges, according to the SPD.",
