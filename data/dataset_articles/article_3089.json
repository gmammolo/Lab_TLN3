  "text": "2023-12-28 23:31:19 Updated: Dec 28, 2023 | 22:31 28 dic 2023 | 22:28 The Minister of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, Elma Saiz, has announced a new reform of the Regulations for the Development of the Organic Law on Immigration with the aim of “simplifying documentation and procedures”, “reducing the number of permits now in force” and ” improve the protection of migrants’ rights”. In this sense, she has specified that it is planned for the first half of 2024. This was made clear this Thursday at the press conference following the Sectoral Migration Conference, where the Government has discussed with the autonomous communities the response to the arrival of migrants to the Spanish coasts. In addition, he reported that the meeting also agreed to hold two Sectoral Migration Conferences per year and that the next one will take place in March 2024. The transposition of the two European regulations approved under the Spanish presidency will also be contemplated: that of the ‘Single Permit Directive’, agreed by the European Parliament and the Council on December 18, which “will allow the procedure for a combined permit to be streamlined of work and residence, and reinforce the guarantees of protection against labor exploitation”, as well as the ‘Long-term residence directive’, which “improves the rights of long-term residents and their families”. On the other hand, the minister has encouraged the attending councilors to “dimension” and “share” with the Government and with the rest of the Autonomous Communities “the resources that each of them has and the investments they have made in immigration matters to provide a more efficient response”. To do this, she has indicated that a technical working group will be created that “will begin to work upon returning from this mini-Christmas break.” Along these lines, Saiz has appealed to the need to work “together” with “solidarity” and “generosity” and has stressed that Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine are “examples” of how local and regional authorities, business associations, social entities and citizens They poured themselves into the reception. He has also announced that the Sectoral Migration Conference has requested the creation of a “specific” group to address the situation of unaccompanied migrant minors. “A specific group” will be created to deal with the situation of unaccompanied minors “Another issue that has been requested and, which is already the responsibility of the Ministry of Youth and Children, is the creation of a specific group to address the issue, the situation of unaccompanied minors,” he assured. Likewise, she has indicated that, from the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, they have shown their “intention” to be able to participate in it. One of the most affected communities is the Canary Islands, where sources from the Canary Islands Government told Europa Press, prior to this meeting, that they have processed the request for meetings with the Ministers of Social Rights, Pablo Bustinduy; Migrations, Elma Saiz; and Childhood, Sira Rego, to address the situation of the 4,461 unaccompanied minors supervised by this community. The Government of the Canary Islands has been raising the need to introduce a modification to the Minors’ Law and establish a co-responsibility mechanism in which the rest of the Autonomous Communities participate, so that the guardianship and care of minors does not fall solely on the Canary Islands. accompanied. From 2021 to the end of November, 365 minors have been referred to other territories and at the last Sectoral Conference on Children and Adolescents it was agreed to refer another 339 minors from the islands to the Peninsula, without these referrals having been carried out that the Canarian executive describes them as “insufficient.” In this regard, the Minister of Social Welfare, Equality, Youth, Children and Families of the Government of the Canary Islands, Candelaria Delgado, has clarified that caring for unaccompanied foreign minors represents an expenditure by the Canary Islands Government of 78 million euros in resources and basic care for minors, to which we must add items, such as the 14.5 million allocated to health care or 3 million dedicated to children’s schooling. In her speech, the head of the Inclusion, Social Security and Migration portfolio announced that she will travel to the Canary Islands on January 9 and 10 “to learn about the work of the teams involved in the management on the ground.” In total, in 2023, 37,187 migrants have arrived irregularly to the Canary archipelago. The Minister of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory, Angel Víctor Torres, also participated in the Sectoral Conference; the Secretary of State for Security, Rafael Pérez; the Secretary of State for Migration, Pilar Cancela, among others, while on behalf of the CCAA, the counselors of Aragon, the Canary Islands, Castilla-La Mancha, Madrid, Navarra, Melilla and the director of Childhood, Adolescence and Youth of Catalonia; and by videoconference the counselor of Andalusia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla y León, Extremadura, Galicia, the Basque Country, Valencia, the Balearic Islands, La Rioja, Murcia and Ceuta. The Canary Islands regret that short-term measures have not been approved After the meeting, the Government of the Canary Islands regretted that no short-term measures had been “approved”, according to Delgado. “The Canary Islands are experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis and it is urgent that a stable reception system be put in place throughout the State to accommodate unaccompanied migrant minors who arrive by sea, just as is done with adults. To do this, it is necessary that European funds can be used to create that stable network that, in addition, is maintained over time,” the counselor requested. Likewise, he has advanced that the Canary Islands are working on a draft modification of the current Law that includes that the care of unaccompanied foreign minors is the responsibility of the State together with the CC.AA, “which will allow the transfer of migrant minors with greater agility “. From the Generalitat of Catalonia, they have reiterated their request to promote more spaces for codecision and coordination to plan the arrival of migrants and asylum seekers in Spain, as sources from the Catalan Executive have explained to Europa Press. They have also requested the transfer of economic funds from the EU to implement reception policies from Catalonia, while celebrating the creation of a working group to specifically address care for unaccompanied minors that will be led by the Ministry of Children. and Youth, among other issues. In this regard, the regional government of Murcia has asked Saiz for state funding to “be able to attend to the arrival of migrants from the Canary Islands.” Likewise, they have requested that unaccompanied minors be identified in the place of origin so that distribution between communities can be carried out in a more balanced and planned way, which is why they have requested that an Intersectoral Conference be convened between the Childhood sector and the Immigration sector. . For her part, the Minister of Social Welfare and Family of the Government of Aragon, Carmen Susín, has criticized that the Autonomous Communities have left the Conference “without information and without financing” to care “under conditions” for the people who are arriving from the Canary Islands. Aragón has been one of the Autonomous Communities that has requested the creation of a working group to deal with the distribution and care of minors arriving in the Canary Islands within the migratory crisis, as an institution competent in the matter, as well as the necessary financing. to serve them in the best conditions. However, the Ministry has refused that it is necessary and has denied that there are minors in the transfers carried out to date, according to the Aragonese Executive. #Elma #Saiz #announces #reform #Regulations #Development #Immigration #Law #speed #procedures",
