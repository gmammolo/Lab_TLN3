  "text": "TN AG calls for action against sellers of counterfeit, contaminated weight-loss drugs\n“Millions of Americans rely on GLP-1 drugs to improve their health, but bad actors are peddling dangerous fakes.”\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, among other attorneys general, is calling for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take action against the sale of counterfeit and unsafe forms of the weight loss and diabetes drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound (GLP-1 drugs).\n“Millions of Americans rely on GLP-1 drugs to improve their health, but bad actors are peddling dangerous fakes,” said AG Skrmetti. “These counterfeit or copycat drugs can be contaminated through shady supply chains running from China, Turkey, and other overseas suppliers, or they can contain entirely different drugs manufactured and packaged to look like GLP-1 drugs. We are asking the FDA to lead efforts to safeguard our American supply chain and to work with other federal and state agencies to stop bad actors from producing counterfeit drugs.”\nHe said that the sky-high demand for GLP-1 drugs alongside high price tags and tight supplies is creating opportunities for bad actors to take advantage of consumers. Skrmetti said that there’s been an increase of the manufacturing and selling of counterfeit, untested products.\n“And counterfeit versions pose not only a risk to public health but also to our national security. There are reports that counterfeit GLP-1 drugs from India, Turkey, China, and other foreign sources have infiltrated the U.S. supply chain,” he said.\nCopyright 2025 WSMV. All rights reserved.",
