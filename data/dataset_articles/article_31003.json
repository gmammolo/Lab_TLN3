  "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (WSYX) — A neurosurgeon at Mount Carmel East Hospital has been suspended by the Ohio State Medical Board.\nThe board said there's \"clear\" and \"convincing\" evidence that Dr. Jeffrey Hatef violated the Ohio Revised Code in treating patients, two of whom died.\nThe body also said Hatef's continued practice would present a danger to the public.\nThe story first came into the ABC 6 newsroom as an anonymous tip.\nThe allegations against Hatef were enough for the State Medical Board to suspend his license on Feb. 12.\nHatef has an office on McNaughten Road in east Columbus, right next to Mount Carmel East Hospital. His name is still on the board there\nThe medical board outlined in its Order for Summary Suspension three cases over a four-month period last year.\nIn one case, the board ruled that the surgery Hatef performed on a 72-year-old man last July was excessive or unjustified, with no evidence to support the need.\nAlso cited was a surgery in September on a 77-year-old woman and another in October on a 78-year-old woman. Both of those women died.\nThe board said that in both of those cases, the extensive surgeries and resulting complications and deaths were reasonably predictable given their ages and poor health.\nThe board added that Hatef's actions were a departure from, or failed to conform to, minimal standards of care.\nABC 6 asked Mount Carmel if it reported Hatef to the Ohio Medical Board, and if so, what triggered that action? The hospital responded with a statement:\nWe are aware that the State Medical Board has suspended Dr. Hatef’s medical license. We fully support the State Medical Board’s investigative process and will cooperate with that process. We automatically suspended Dr. Hatef’s clinical privileges at all Mount Carmel facilities and placed him on administrative leave.\nThe board said Hatef’s attorneys have requested an administrative hearing, but it has not been scheduled yet. ABC 6 is awaiting a reply from them.",
