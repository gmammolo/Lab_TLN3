  "text": "How big of a deal is the bird flu in Michiana?\nPublished: Feb. 20, 2025 at 5:00 PM EST|Updated: moments ago\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - The bird flu has been spreading across the country, and now it’s made it way to Michiana.\nAccording to Purdue Extension, a case was confirmed at a commercial breeder duck facility in Elkhart County earlier this week.\nKathryn Jennings, a Purdue livestock educator, joined us on WNDU 16 News Now at 4 to give us more perspective on how big of a deal this is and tell us what farmers can do to protect themselves. You can learn more by watching the video above.\nBiosecurity Measures for Farms\n- Ensure proper disinfection of equipment on dairy farms.\n- Milk sick or quarantined cows last and isolate them from the rest of the herd.\n- Prevent cross-contamination by cleaning equipment and boots between uses and managing farm equipment movement.\n- Quarantine new cattle for at least 30 days before introducing them to the herd.\n- Keep different species separate when possible, as HPAI can affect both poultry and cattle.\n- Limit access of wild birds to livestock buildings.\n- Monitor animals for symptoms such as reduced milk production, fever, lethargy, and discolored milk.\n- Farm workers handling animals suspected of or confirmed to have HPAI should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), which includes disposable boots and gloves, safety goggles or face shields, NIOSH-approved respirators, disposable coveralls and head covers\n- Be sure to wash hands before and after using PPE.\nCopyright 2025 WNDU.
