  "text": "When Shailyn Pinkney suffered a lower leg injury in December, the early prognosis was that it would not be a long-term issue. \"We're hoping a week, two weeks, that she'll be back at the end of the month,\" Seton Hall coach Tony Bozzella said Dec. 17 after the Pirates' appearance in the Basketball Hall of Fame Women's Showcase at Mohegan Sun Arena. But December turned to January and January to February and the 5-foot-10 junior wing from East Hartford remained sidelined. After a 91-49 home loss to No. 5 UConn at Walsh Gymnasium Wednesday night, a Seton Hall spokesman confirmed to CT Insider that Pinkney is done for the year with the lower leg injury. Having played in only nine games, Pinkney should qualify for a medical redshirt and maintain two years of eligibility. A two-time GametimeCT state Player of the Year who led East Hartford to the CIAC Class LL state tournament title, the program's first, in 2022, Pinkney's first two seasons at Seton Hall were filled with highs and lows. In 54 games with 25 starts, she averaged 2.0 points and 2.1 rebounds in 12.2 minutes per game. But after Seton Hall was eliminated by Creighton in the 2024 Big East Tournament quarterfinals, Pinkney said, \"Next year is going to be my year for sure. I know it's going to be my year.\" It began that way. She started the Pirates' first seven games before getting starters' minutes off the bench the next two. \"Shailyn was playing fantastic,\" Bozzella said. \"She had evolved into a starting-type player. Then we moved her into that sixth-man role because we wanted another ballhandler in there. She was doing great.\" Pinkney averaged career-bests 6.4 points on 45.7 percent shooting from the floor and 3.4 rebounds in 24.0 minutes per game. After totaling 26 assists and nine steals in her first 54 games, she had 14 assists and nine steals in nine games. In a Dec. 2 win over San Francisco, she netted a career-high 14 points and played one of her best overall games off the bench four days later in a win over Howard with 10 points, seven rebounds, and career-highs of four assists and three steals. She'd play one more game and had seven points and four rebounds as Seton Hall defeated Sacred Heart on Dec. 9. Picked for seventh in the Big East coaches preseason poll, the Pirates (18-8, 10-5 Big East) have topped last year's win total with three regular-season games remaining and are tied for third place in the conference with Marquette and Villanova. Seton Hall can clinch a first-round bye for the Big East Tournament with one win or a DePaul loss and appears to have the easiest path to the No. 3 seed. The Pirates own the tiebreaker with Villanova and split with Marquette, and are the only one of the three who don't play a ranked team the rest of the way. Seton Hall is at St. John's Sunday, hosts DePaul Feb. 27, and visits last-place Xavier March 2. The Big East Tournament is set for March 7-10 at Mohegan Sun Arena.",
