  "text": "NBA All-Star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the San Antonio Spurs announced Thursday. What is deep vein thrombosis? It's the third most common vascular disease, according to Cleveland Clinic . Deep vein thrombosis happens when a blood clot forms in veins located deep in the body, with the Mayo Clinic saying the \"main causes are damage to a vein from surgery or inflammation and damage due to infection or injury.\" \"Most DVTs happen in your lower leg, thigh or pelvis, but they also can occur in other parts of your body including your arm, brain, intestines, liver or kidney,\" according to Cleveland Clinic. It typically occurs \"because your veins are injured or the blood flowing through them is too sluggish. The blood clots may partially or completely block blood flow through your vein.\" The Mayo Clinic says the condition can be serious because blood clots in the veins can break loose and get stuck in the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism if not treated. The Mayo Clinic notes that there are several treatment options, including: Here's what deep vein thrombosis can entail, according to the Cleveland Clinic : Here are some conditions that can increase your risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis, according to the Cleveland Clinic: Recovery can take a few months to a year. \"A DVT can take several months to a year to come apart, so you’ll need to keep taking blood thinner medicines as instructed and keep wearing compression stockings until your provider tells you to stop,\" according to Cleveland Clinic. \"You may need blood tests to make sure you’re getting the right dose of blood thinners. Your provider may want to do more ultrasounds later to find out if your blood clot is still in the same place, improving or getting larger.\" Deep vein thrombosis is relatively atypical for athletes. \"Blood clots are uncommon in young, healthy individuals — and most athletes are young and healthy,\" according to the Blood Clot Alliance website. \"So, for that reason, (deep vein thrombosis), (pulmonary embolisms) and arterial clots in athletes are not the norm.\" Former Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat forward Chris Bosh ultimately saw his career ended due to deep vein thrombosis. His was in his lung, however. This article originally appeared on The Repository: Spurs' Victor Wembanyama diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis. Explaining the condition",
