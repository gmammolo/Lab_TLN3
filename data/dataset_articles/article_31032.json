  "text": "Americans are weathering the worst flu season in years, as a number of other respiratory illnesses circulate too, such as COVID-19, RSV and the common cold.\nA telltale sign you’re getting sick is excess mucus, and if you’ve ever been desperate to stop coughing and sneezing, you’ve likely examined your mucus color, from yellow to green, for signs you may be healing.\n“We are in the midst of one of the most severe flu seasons in the past few decades, and it is important to maintain our health by following good hygienic practices and getting vaccinated,” Dr. Aaron Glatt , chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York, tells TODAY.com.\nFlu activity tends to increase after the holidays, but this winter’s flu activity is unusually high for mid-February, experts say. Some schools are temporarily closing due to illnesses, and some hospitals are overwhelmed with patients.\nCOVID-19 activity is also high or very high in 30 states, according to wastewater data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, RSV rates are declining but are still higher than they were in early December.\nWhen you have a respiratory illness, excess mucus is an under-appreciated line of defense from your immune system. But can you really tell what kind of illness you have or where you are in your infection based on your mucus? Here’s a breakdown of what goes on inside our body when we’re sick and why mucus changes colors.\nWhat is mucus? Why does your body produce it? Mucus is the body’s natural moisturizer and provides a first line of defense against irritants from the outside environment.\nIt lubricates the lining of the nose when it gets too dry but also traps outside invaders, like germs and dust, because of how sticky it becomes.\n“Our bodies produce mucus as both a normal way to help maintain good health and to help one fight off infection,” Glatt states.\nNormal mucus often looks clear or white for most people, experts say.\nBut mucus changes color, depending on the individual’s environment, in response to various germs and more, he adds.\nWhat does yellow mucus mean? Yellow mucus means your body's immune system has been activated, which can change the color or consistency of your mucus, according to the Cleveland Clinic .\nInitially, during an infection, the mucus will be clear, but it usually changes to yellow within a few days. Many people believe that yellow or green mucus indicates a bacterial infection, but experts caution that color doesn’t correlate to a particular type of infection, as both viruses and bacteria can cause yellow mucus.\nYellow mucus could also be caused by non-infectious triggers, like allergies.\nDoes yellow mucus mean a cold is healing? In a typical viral respiratory infection, such as the common cold, mucus in the nose starts out as clear but gradually turns yellow or green as the infection progresses.\nSo essentially, yellow mucus just means your immune system has been activated. For signs your cold is getting better , look for:\nThe mucus turning clear again Your symptoms becoming less severe, like having fever body aches and less nasal congestion A week has passed and you're feeling overall better Your energy coming back What stage of infection is yellow mucus? It often is an early sign of an infection.\nDr. Scott Roberts , associate medical director of infection prevention at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, however, cautions to not judge mucus by its color.\nHe recommends paying more attention to the consistency of the mucus — whether there is thick pus or not — to know if you have a sinus infection.\nFor example, thin mucus may be a sign of an early infection, but as the mucus thickens, this suggests more severe congestion in the nose, experts say.\nWhat does green mucus mean? Green mucus is also a sign that your body either has encountered an irritant or is experiencing an infection.\n“Mucus may go from a clearer appearance to a much more infected (pus-like) and green appearance in response to viral or bacterial infection,” Glatt says.\nThe mucus may also change from yellow to green as it becomes more concentrated, often when we are sleeping or not well hydrated.\nA common myth is that green mucus is a tell-tale sign of a bacterial infection, but both viruses and bacteria can cause this color change. In fact, past research has found that nasal discharge turns different colors due to the presence of white blood cells, which battle the infection.\nHowever, one clue you might need antibiotics is persistent thick, green discharge lasting for more than 10 days, according to Mayo Clinic .\nWhat do other mucus colors mean? Mucus often changes colors when dead cells, germs and other substances, like blood or tobacco smoke, gets mixed with it, according to Cleveland Clinic . These colors include:\nPink: Mucus can turn pink after an injury to the nose when it gets streaked with blood. It can also be a sign your nasal passages are so dry that tiny blood vessels that line them have burst and leaked blood. Brown : This may be a sign of a more severe infection like bronchitis or pneumonia. It is also common during colder seasons (when the air in our homes have less humidity), which leads to dry nasal passages that cause small amounts of blood from tiny burst blood vessels in the nose. Black : This could be old, dried blood. The mucus can also turn black when environmental irritants, like dust particles, smoke or other air pollutants, get stuck in the nasal passages. Serious fungal infections can darken mucus as well. How to get rid of mucus Druckman says “fluids and rest are key.”\n“Making sure you’re drinking enough water will help flush out any mucus and help thin it out, and getting adequate rest will help your body heal faster.”\n“Another way to reduce the effects of mucus is to place a humidifier in your room, which can help loosen your mucus a bit and make it easier to manage,” he adds.\n“For optimal drainage, it’s recommended to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to ease symptoms.”\nOther home remedies include:\nNasal rinses, which help clear the mucus from your nose and sinuses Decongestants to temporarily decrease inflammation in the nose and mouth. Expectorants to thin out the mucus so it’s easier to clear it out Antihistamines to calm down the body’s immune system, which causes excess mucus When to see a doctor If you don’t feel something is exactly right about the color or consistency of your mucus, check in with your doctor.\nThe duration of symptoms also matters. You should also seek medical attention if you have persistent colored mucus and symptoms for more than a week, Druckman adds.\nSome other warning signs are:\nDark-colored mucus Too much blood mixed in with mucus Thick nasal discharge with facial pain lasting longer than 10 days Persistent fevers Runny nose with a persistent cough or chest tightness Severe symptoms not improving with home remedies “To stay protected, I recommend getting the flu vaccine, washing hands frequently, and staying home when feeling unwell,” Druckman says.\n“Taking these steps can help reduce the spread and protect yourself and those around you during flu season.”",
