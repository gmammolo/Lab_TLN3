  "text": "Ülker treats distributed to over 30 states recalled for allergen mislabeling: See products\n- Six varieties of Ülker snack rolls, biscuits and wafers failed to disclose allergens in the ingredients list.\n- The mislabeling was identified by a single consumer complaint involving an allergic reaction.\n- Consumers who have purchased an affected product should return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.\nSix varieties of Ülker snack rolls, biscuits and wafers distributed to over 30 states were recalled because possible allergens were not explicitly listed on product labels.\nThe recall, issued by ZB Importing LLC and posted Thursday by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, states that wheat, egg and/or milk were not declared on the products' labels. Consumers with an allergy or severe sensitivity to wheat, egg and/or milk run the risk of life-threatening allergic reactions, if they consume these products.\nThe mislabeling was identified by a single consumer complaint involving an allergic reaction, according to the recall. The issue originated from a supplier who failed to fully disclose all allergens while translating the ingredient list.\nHere's what to know about which products are affected and where.\nWhich products are listed in the recall?\nThe recall includes six items sold under the brand name Ülker, a Turkish food and beverage manufacturer based in Istanbul.\nCan't see the PDF in your browser?
