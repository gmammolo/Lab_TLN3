  "text": "Elderly man dies from melioidosis in Townsville following record rainfall and flooding\nAnother person has died from a disease linked with heavy rain in a flood-hit region that may soon be on cyclone watch.\nQueensland Health confirmed an elderly person had died of melioidosis in Townsville while three new cases of dengue virus had also been discovered in the community.\nIt came after it was revealed melioidosis had claimed four lives further north in Cairns, with the region recording a total number of 41 cases since January 1.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nThe disease is associated with the wet season and is spread through contact with contaminated water, soil and air, causing death in up to 20 per cent of treated cases.\nNorth Queensland is reeling from record rainfall that triggered flooding, claiming two lives and forcing hundreds of people to evacuate their homes.\nMore rain may be on the way with a cyclone potentially heading toward the north Queensland coast mid-next week.\nMelioidosis cases in Cairns are believed to have doubled compared with 2024 after heavy rain lashed the north for weeks, prompting a health warning.\nThe Townsville community is being reminded of the wet season’s health risks after confirmation the elderly person died of the soil-borne disease in the past week.\n“Melioidosis cases have increased throughout the wet season, in some cases leading to hospitalisations,” Townsville Public Health Unit director Dr Steven Donohue said.\n“Melioidosis is a very serious infectious disease which is caused by soil bacteria in northern Australia.”\nThe disease can occur when cuts or wounds come in contact with contaminated mud or water and when people breathe in muddy droplets.\nSymptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing while skin infections or abscesses can be another sign.\nFebruary 2025 is officially the wettest month in history for some north Queensland towns with Paluma near Townsville recording more than 2m of rain — double what Sydney receives in a year.\nAn investigation is underway after three new dengue virus cases from two adjacent houses in South Townsville were discovered.\nTo combat melioidosis infection, locals have been urged to wear gloves, shoes and protective clothing when cleaning up after the recent wet — but more may be on the way.\nA tropical low set to form off Queensland is a low chance of becoming a cyclone on Friday, increasing to a “high” chance by Sunday night.\nIt’s set to move away from the coast towards the Solomon Islands but mid-next week it may track south and close in on Queensland.\n“It still has a high chance of being a cyclone at that stage,” the Bureau of Meteorology told AAP.\n“But there’s a lot of uncertainty beyond next Wednesday.”\nOriginally published on 7NEWS",
