  "text": "Nebraska experiencing one of the worst flu seasons as cases continue to climb\nBy Jolie Peal , Reporter Nebraska Public Media News\nFeb. 20, 2025, 4 p.m. ·\nListen To This Story\nMore than 15,000 influenza cases have been reported this flu season, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. Influenza A is the main strain taking over the state this year, with more than 14,000 cases.\nNumbers are still climbing, and several state health officials said it's unusual for peak flu numbers to arrive so late in the season.\n“We’re still peaking as for the cases in Nebraska and in the U.S.,” Dr. Renuga Vivekanandan, an infectious disease physician and Chief Medical Officer for CHI said. “I would say we’re still going to expect more cases middle of March, end of March, and then it slowly should taper off.”\nVivekanandan recommends those with symptoms — like runny nose and a fever — talk to their primary care provider about getting tested or take an at-home test.\nNebraskans can also take preventative measures to protect against catching the flu or other illnesses. Molly Herman, epidemiology manager at the Northeast Nebraska Public Health Department, said it’s never too late to get vaccinated for the flu or other respiratory illnesses like COVID.\n“Since Nebraskans care about their communities, something they can do that's really quick and relatively easy is get that flu shot or COVID shot,” Herman said. “You're going to need to reduce the risk of getting grandma sick, which could end up being a catastrophic illness for grandma.”\nHerman said local health departments can connect those looking to get vaccinated with places that can do it for free.\nThe cold weather is one factor causing higher amounts of cases because people are indoors more and, Herman said, the low temperatures keep germs alive.\n“For example, if someone coughs into their hand and then uses that hand to open a door outside, it's possible that the flu virus could hang out on that door handle longer during cold times than in the middle of summer,” she said.\nHerman and Vivekanandan both recommended eating healthy, staying hydrated and washing hands to keep from getting sick. Herman also said people can make a homemade air purifier with a box fan and furnace filter to help stop the spread of germs.",
