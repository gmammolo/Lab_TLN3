  "text": "COLUMBIA, Mo. (KMIZ)\nA Columbia physician pleaded guilty in federal court in Jefferson City on Thursday for Medicare fraud.\nDr. Jerry Joseph Bruggeman, 53, pleaded guilty to making false statements relating to a heath care matter, according to a press release from the Department of Justice. He was previously indicted on 13 counts. A sentencing hearing has not been scheduled.\nThe release says that the Office of the Inspector General became aware of a Medicare patient being invoiced for medical services from Bruggeman in 2020, even though they never heard of the doctor. Bruggeman allegedly made 26 claims to Medicare in 2019 and an investigation found that Bruggeman referred more than 3,100 orders for cancer and pharmacological genetic testing, as well as medical equipment from January 2018-December 2019.\nIt had resulted in more than $1.6 million in claims being paid by Medicare, the release says. During the period of Jan. 31, 2018-April 2019, Bruggeman received $29,440 in compensation from the orders that he signed, the release says.",
