  "text": "Chris Bosh's 13-year NBA career was fruitful, but it was cut short by factors outside his control. The final game of Bosh's NBA career came one month before he celebrated his 32nd birthday. His Hall-of-Fame career was not cut short by injury, but rather by recurring blood clots that forced him into an early retirement. At the time of his final game, Bosh was redefining himself in his early 30s. He had just earned his 11th consecutive All-Star selection and was averaging 19.1 points per game while canning a career-best 1.5 3-pointers per game. Despite contractual agreements and a brief comeback attempt, Bosh officially retired from the NBA three years later. Here is how blood clots forced Bosh to step away from the NBA for good. | | In February 2015, Bosh was admitted to a hospital for lung tests after complaining about chest discomfort. On Feb. 21, 2015, he was ruled out for the remainder of the 2014-15 NBA season after developing blood clots in one of his lungs. Bosh was expected to be sidelined for at least six months as the blood-thinning medication used to treat such a condition requires limited physical activity. He returned to the court on opening night of the 2015-16 NBA season, appearing in each of the Heat's first 53 games before sustaining a calf injury in early February. An 18-point performance against the Spurs on Feb. 9, 2016, would be Bosh's last in the NBA. During the 2016 NBA All-Star break, doctors discovered another blood clot in Bosh's leg. He was held out of the remainder of the 2015-16 season and the entirety of the 2016 NBA Playoffs. He failed a physical ahead of training camp for the 2016-17 season and team president Pat Riley said Bosh's career with the Heat \"was probably over.\" Bosh missed the entirety of the 2016-17 season, and in May 2017, he and the Heat agreed that he would leave the team before 2017-18. The NBA ruled Bosh's blood-clotting as a career-ending illness in June 2017. He was waived by the Heat days later. In February 2018, Bosh announced he would attempt to make an NBA comeback, but the attempt was short-lived. Bosh formally retired from the NBA when the Heat retired his No. 1 jersey on March 26, 2019. Blood clots are semi-solid or gel-like masses of blood cells that form in a person's blood vessels, per the Cleveland Clinic . While they help control bleeding, blood clots can cause serious medical issues, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and heart attack. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a \"deep vein,\" most often occurring in the leg. The condition can cause \"pain, warmth and tenderness in the affected area,\" according to the Mayo Clinic , but the greater concern is the risk of a blood clot traveling to somewhere it would be more dangerous, such as the lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot in your lung that creates a blockage, causing issues with blood flow and oxygen levels in your lungs, per the Cleveland Clinic . This is considered a medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a clot in another part of the body (often leg or arm) moves through your veins to the lung. Pulmonary embolism is the third-most common heart and blood vessel disease in the world. The Raptors selected Bosh fourth overall in the 2003 NBA Draft. Bosh spent the first seven seasons of his career in Toronto. Among Bosh's biggest Raptors highlights is helping the franchise snap a five-year playoff drought in 2007, earning five All-Star selections and the lone All-NBA nod of his career. As it stands, Bosh is third on Toronto's all-time points list (10,275), first in rebounds (4,776) and blocks (600). Bosh signed with the Heat in 2010 and was an All-Star each season he played in Miami. He and the Heat made four consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2010 to 2014, winning titles in 2012 and 2013. His final game in a Heat uniform was an 18-point performance on Feb. 9, 2016. Bosh's net worth is $110 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth . The actual figure may be harder to decipher. Bosh made over $185 million during his playing career. He was waived following the 2016-17 season but was owed $52.1 million for the remainder of his contract, bringing his career earnings closer to $240 million, per Spotrac . Bosh is also involved in numerous business ventures and investments.",
