  "text": "NBA rookie of the year Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the season due to a deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the San Antonio Spurs said on Thursday.\nThe Spurs said Wembanyama's condition was discovered when the 21-year-old Frenchman returned to San Antonio following the NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco last weekend.\n\"Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season,\" the Spurs said in a statement. \"The team will provide updates as appropriate.\"\nWembanyama, considered a once-in-a-generation talent who the Spurs selected with the first pick of the 2023 NBA Draft, was averaging a team-high 24.3 points and 11 rebounds this season along with a league-leading 3.8 blocks per game this season. — Reuters",
