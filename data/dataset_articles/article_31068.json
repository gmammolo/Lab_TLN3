  "text": "A St. Louis physician who owned two urgent care centers was sentenced to 35 months in prison for defrauding Medicare and Missouri Medicaid.\nSonny Saggar, MD, 57, was also ordered to repay more than $740,000, according to a Feb. 19 Justice Department news release.\nDr. Saggar was sentenced after pleading guilty in August to one count of conspiracy. He admitted that while operating St. Louis General Hospital locations in the city and Creve Coeur, Mo., he and his office manager hired assistant physicians to see patients but billed federal healthcare programs as if he had seen them.\nThe office manager, Renita Barringer, 51, pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiracy. She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 22.\nDr. Saggar and Ms. Barringer caused Medicare and Medicaid to lose $742,528, according to the release.",
