  "text": "My 95 year old mom has been having some health issues lately. Hospital called just as I was leaving for my daily visit and said I better get up there, she might not last the night. Was healthy & active 3 weeks ago. All Democratic thoughts, prayers, vibes needed. She goes by Betty\nI hope she is able to recover and be able to enjoy life unimpaired and in comfort.\nOur prayers are with you and your family. My Sister, also named Betty, was transported by ambulance to a hospital in Frankfort, Kentucky yesterday. I am sure we are all connected in this world, however much we may believe we are independent.\nHugs for you",
