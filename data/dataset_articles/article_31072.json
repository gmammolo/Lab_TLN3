  "text": "The Montana House of Representatives on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly against House Bill 371, a measure that would have banned mRNA vaccines — used primarily in COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots — and made it a misdemeanor to administer the shots. Introduced by Greg Kmetz, R-Miles City, the contentious bill revealed deep-held beliefs by some lawmakers about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine technology that became common during the global coronavirus pandemic. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and boosters from Moderna and Pfizer. The FDA has also approved a Moderna mRNA vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. Kmetz said he became politically active during the pandemic, starting when then-Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, ordered non-essential businesses to temporarily close down. He said his wife lost her job in the healthcare field for not getting vaccinated, and a friend’s grandson was hospitalized for one of the rare side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. https://dailymontanan.com/2025/02/20/montana-lawmakers-reject-ban-mrna-vaccines/",
