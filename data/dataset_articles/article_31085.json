  "text": "Claressa Shields has been suspended by the Michigan Unarmed Combat Commission after testing positive for marijuana following her win over heavyweight Danielle Perkins earlier this month, according to reports. Shields, 29, tested positive for the banned substance via an \"oral fluid sample\" following her win over Perkins on Feb. 3, Sky News and BBC reported on Thursday, prompting the Michigan Unarmed Combat Commission to open an investigation. Shields, a native of Flint, Michigan, will not be able to compete in Michigan while suspended. \"Ms Shields' conduct as a licensed professional boxer constitutes an imminent threat to the integrity of professional boxing, the public interest, and the welfare and safety of professional athletes,\" the Michigan Unarmed Combat Commission said in a statement to Sky News . The suspension comes less than a month after Shields made history and became the first boxer, male or female, to win undisputed titles in three different weight classes after defeating Perkins by unanimous decision on Feb. 3 at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan . Shields, a two-time Olympic gold medalist and women's boxing champion, moved to 16-0 with three TKOs with the win. Shields responded to the news of her suspension on X (formerly Twitter), writing, she's \"never smoked weed.\" She continued, \"It was marijuana, no PEDs. ... it’s a temporary suspension (until) I go to trial for the very petite amount.\" In another tweet, she added , \"And still the UNDISPUTED WOMENS HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION!\" Last week, Shields shot down rumors that she tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug, declaring she's \"been a clean athlete all my life.\" She added, \"To ever put my name and PEDS with positive and my name in the sentence is damaging.\" Although marijuana has been legal in Michigan since late 2018, marijuana is banned from competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
