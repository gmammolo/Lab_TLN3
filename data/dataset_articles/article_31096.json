  "text": "TOWN OF MOHAWK — One man was displaced after his home was destroyed by fire early Wednesday morning, according to Mohawk Fire Chief Todd Winsman.\nThe home at 3186 Route 5 was fully involved when crews arrived following a 911 call from a passerby around 2:49 a.m.\n“I'm not sure how long it was going before we got there,” Winsman said Thursday.\nThe homeowner had been unable to find his cellphone to report the fire after waking to discover clothing burning on a rack in an area with a wood stove.\nThe man threw the burning clothes out of the house and attempted to put out the fire before crews arrived. He was the only occupant of the home and was able to safely exit the building.\n“We're not sure if it was something with the stove itself, but that was deemed the cause, clothes catching on fire on a clothes rack,” Winsman said.\nThe Town of Mohawk Fire Department requested mutual aid upon arrival and crews from multiple agencies responded to the scene.\nFrigid temperatures and strong winds complicated the operation. Firefighters were unable to open a nearby hydrant and were forced to establish a water supply near the town barn.\n“This time of the year, you hope that doesn't happen, but obviously, with this cold weather we've had, things are just freezing up,” Winsman said.\nStill, Winsman said the first apparatus to arrive was a 3,000-gallon tanker on which a deck gun was used to try to knock down the fire.\nAnother truck had to be set up outside a home around 200 yards away to protect the structure from embers landing on the roof carried from the burning building by strong winds.\nThere were no injuries among firefighters despite the cold and icy conditions. The Montgomery County Emergency Management Department’s rehab bus was brought to the scene to provide space for firefighters to warm up over the course of the operation.\n“Obviously, your gear is getting wet, your gloves are getting wet, everybody's freezing up,” Winsman said.\nAn excavator was brought in to tear down the three walls that were left standing when the fire was extinguished. Crews hosed down the materials to ensure the fire was out.\nThe scene was largely cleared around 7 a.m. Some firefighters remained on hand until the state Department of Transportation salted and cleared ice from the road following the operation.\n“There was probably four or five inches of slush and ice right there on the road,” Winsman said, estimating around 80,000 gallons of water had been used to extinguish the blaze.\nThe homeowner is staying with family locally and declined assistance from the American Red Cross. Winsman said aid can be provided in the future should the need arise.\nThe Town of Mohawk Fire Department was assisted at the scene by the Tribes Hill Fire Department, Town of Glen Volunteer Fire Department, Fultonville Fire Department and Fort Hunter Engine & Hose Company Inc.",
