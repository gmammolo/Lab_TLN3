  "text": "Bradshaws may have a bit of a problem at home. See, it’s always been Terry Bradshaw who has dominated the news for either his fumbles as a Fox Sports broadcaster or his growing age. But since the Super Bowl is over and there are no games to cover. The former Steelers’ 4-time Super Bowl-winning QB has somewhat taken a backseat with his shenanigans on live air. So, this time, the focus is on his second eldest daughter, Erin, who may have revealed something concerning about her.\nOn her recent Instagram stories, Erin was captured having a laugh about her ADHD. She shared a story where a man was dancing with the video titled “ADHDers after finally making that phone call they’d avoided for weeks.” Erin even captioned the post with the message, “Made all my phone calls yesterday. Glad that’s done until next month.” Now, you could probably say she is just an introvert who isn’t too keen on interaction. Because before today, there wasn’t any news of Erin having ADHD. Maybe she is just having a bit of fun relating her social anxiety with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nWell, away from just avoiding phone calls, which clearly Erin isn’t really fond of. She is a World Champion equestrian hailing from the state of Cowboys, Texas. Unlike phone calls, horses aren’t something that Erin likes to avoid. Instead, she loves spending her time as a professional horse rider. Just a few years back, she even told Cowgirl Magazine how Bradshaw was the primary reason for her falling in love with horses. “My dad put me on a horse when I was 5, and really let me start living that dream. Without him. I don’t really think I would have even started riding.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nErin, for one, took her love for horses up a notch by marrying a horse trainer. She tied the knot with Scott Weiss in 2017. And you know what’s the special part of her marriage. Both of them have a ranch together, just like a dream of a cowgirl and a cowboy. Most of Erin’s day passes by training and breeding those horses on her ranch. Maybe that’s why she isn’t too invested in returning calls. Because her horses already keep her occupied enough.\nWhile Erin probably refuses to leave her ranch in Texas, her father also does the same with his broadcasting career. He just doesn’t know when it’s time to walk away.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nTerry Bradshaw didn’t surprise anyone with his retirement decision\nWith the season coming to a close, there was always supposed to be a drama surrounding Bradshaw’s retirement. His constant troubles on air last season led fans to call for his retirement. They have had enough of Bradshaw trying to continue his Fox analyst role, which he has held since 1994. Yes, it’s over 30 years since Bradshaw has served in that exact role. And maybe that’s why he cannot roll his mind around the fact that retirement is knocking on his door. “I told my wife before I left the hotel room. I was sitting there, I said. I’ve got two years left at Fox. I’m 76.”\nTwo years—who are we kidding here, Bradshaw? Actually, the 76-year-old doesn’t want to walk away until he gets to serve the next Super Bowl on Fox. “If we can get to the next Super Bowl. I’ll be 80. I think that’s time. That’s pushing it.” Just think about it for a moment. Retiring at 80 would be some feat for Bradshaw. Because there’s no way anyone could even dream about pushing that far. However, the concern is whether he will actually manage to do so. See, there are already signs of deterioration in his capabilities.\nWhat’s your perspective on:\nIs Terry Bradshaw holding on too long, or does he still have more to offer on air?\nHave an interesting take?\nHis hands were shaking when he was interviewing the Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni. It’s not like fans are just calling for his retirement because of his diminishing broadcasting abilities. He should also consider his health and walk away before it gets worse. That’s my two cents on Bradshaw’s retirement decision.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\nHave something to say?\nLet the world know your perspective.\nADVERTISEMENT\nDebate\nIs Terry Bradshaw holding on too long, or does he still have more to offer on air?\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT",
