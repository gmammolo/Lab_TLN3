David Ige FILE - The new patient facility at the Hawaiʻi State Hospital in Kāneʻohe on Aug. 3, 2021. The state wants nearly $40 million to address building defects at a new building at the Hawaiʻi State Hospital in Kāneʻohe.\nIn 2021, the state unveiled the $160 million, 144-bed psychiatric facility. But the state delayed its opening for a year in part to address issues with the shower floors, door handles and hinges — along with staffing difficulties.\nState officials told lawmakers about recent drainage problems and leaks, heavily corroded air conditioning parts, and mold at the facility.\nThey said that contractor Hensel Phelps, which built the facility, is responsible for the defects. They are contemplating a lawsuit to ensure the company pays for the repairs.\nThe Conversation Patients are settling in at Hawaiʻi State Hospital, but construction fixes are ongoing (March 2023) Catherine Cruz\nListen • 8:30 The hospital is in the district represented by Rep. Scot Matayoshi, who said the state should have litigated the issue years ago.\n“I am disappointed that through the years it's taken since we first detected a lot of these construction defects that litigation has either not started or that we hadn't gotten any kind of commitment from Hensel Phelps to pay back the money that we're now fronting,” Matayoshi said.\n“Now, to come to the state for $40 million, that's $40 million that really could be spent elsewhere in a time where our budget is already crunched, where we're already looking at losing a bunch of federal funding.”\nThe state is asking legislators for about $8 million to do immediate repairs and about $28 million primarily to fix the roof.\nThe hospital primarily houses patients with significant mental health issues who have been ordered there by the courts after committing crimes. Courts may also order people to stay there while they wait for evaluations on whether they are mentally fit to stand trial.",
