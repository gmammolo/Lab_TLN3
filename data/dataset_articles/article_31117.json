  "text": "Let your community know\nLet the family know you are thinking of them\nHear your loved one's obituary\nWilliam “Bill” Hall, 71, of St. Wendel, passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, February 16, 2025, in Clarksville, Tennessee while driving home after six weeks in his favorite place, Marco Island, Florida. We are all deeply saddened and shocked by his sudden death.\nBill was born on October 19, 1953, in Evansville to the late Jack and Shirley (Weiberg) Hall. He retired from Millwright Local 1080. Bill made friends easily and had a routine of making his rounds at the local watering holes to visit his buddies. Those who knew Bill will remember him being easy going and never in a hurry. His motto was “never do today what you can put off until tomorrow”.\nSurviving Bill are his wife of 47 years, Shirley; brother, John Hall; his in-laws, many nieces and nephews.\nTo honor Bill’s wishes there will be no public visitation or funeral services held. Please celebrate Bill’s memory privately, in your own way. We know he will be with us all in spirit. Thank you for your understanding and support in this difficult time.\nCondolences may be made online at www.pierrefuneralhome.com.\nPosted online on February 20, 2025\nPublished in The Evansville Courier & Press\nShare a memory, offer a condolence\nHear your loved one's obituary\nLet your community know\nGive to a forest in need in their memory\nLet the family know you are thinking of them",
