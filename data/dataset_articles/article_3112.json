  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Karkala (MS)\nKarkala, Dec 29: Locals intervened and apprehended a man who had been persistently stalking and harassing a young girl in the evening on December 27, near the city bus stand.\nThe victim, an employee at a private finance company in the city, had been experiencing harassment from Jagadish Poojary, a resident of Irvathoor, for several days. On that particular evening, as the girl headed towards the bus stand to return home to Nandalike, Jagadish continued his unwelcome pursuit. He obstructed her path and attempted to engage her in conversation, prompting the girl to object.\nWitnessing Jagadish's troubling behaviour, concerned locals took matters into their own hands, ensuring his capture, and subsequently handed him over to the police.\nPolice interrogation revealed that Jagadish Poojary is a habitual offender, having harassed multiple young girls in the past. The Karkala city police are conducting further investigations into the matter.\nDisclaimer:\nPlease write your correct name and email address.
