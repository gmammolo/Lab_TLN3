  "text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — Democratic governors from across the country are speaking out against proposed Medicaid cuts, warning that millions of Americans could lose access to essential healthcare services. As congressional Republicans push forward with their budget plan, Democratic leaders argue that the proposal threatens the future of Medicaid. “It will affect millions of Americans,” said Hawaii Gov. Josh Green during a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Green said the cuts would disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. “Those people tend to be children, people with disabilities, those with very serious illnesses, and individuals living in poverty,” Green said. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham described a dire situation if the proposed cuts are enacted. “Hospitals close, doctors stop providing care, no more independent practices, no more long-term care facilities,” Lujan Grisham said. Despite President Donald Trump stating he wants to protect Medicaid, his position appears to conflict with the House GOP’s budget plan, which seeks to reduce Medicaid funding over the next decade. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) acknowledged Medicaid’s importance but stressed the need for reforms. “To have the best system and the most efficient system, we need to make sure there is no waste or fraud,” Moore Capito said. Democratic governors vowed to continue fighting to preserve Medicaid funding, but with budget negotiations looming, the battle over the program’s future remains unresolved.
