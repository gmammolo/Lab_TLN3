  "text": "The San Antonio Spurs announced Thursday that star rookie Victor Wembanyama will miss the remainder of the 2024-25 NBA season due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder.\nThe rare condition, which involves a blood clot restricting blood flow in the affected area, was discovered after Wembanyama returned to San Antonio from the NBA All-Star Game. Treatment typically involves blood-thinning medication, which makes participation in contact sports like basketball unsafe.\nSpurs Optimistic About Full Recovery Despite the shocking and abrupt end to his rookie season, Spurs officials remain hopeful that Wembanyama will make a full recovery in time for the 2025-26 season. A team source told ESPN that there is no long-term concern about his health, and the focus is on his safety and ensuring a full return.\nSocial Media Speculation Surrounding Vaccine Links Following the announcement of Wembanyama’s blood clot diagnosis, social media was flooded with theories linking his condition to the COVID-19 vaccine. However, medical experts and analysts quickly debunked these claims, reiterating that there is no scientific evidence connecting vaccinations to deep vein thrombosis.\nRELATED: Victor Wembanyama’s Giant Hand Stuns Fans in Jaw-Dropping Photo with Allie LaForce\nVictor Wembanyama should sue the vaccine company that made the clot shot AND the NBA pic.twitter.com/J5zuY35XU1\n— The Washington Redskins {Kaisar}?||?

The Spurs have not provided details on what may have contributed to Wembanyama’s diagnosis but stated they will issue updates as appropriate.\nWembanyama’s Historic Rookie Season Cut Short The reigning Rookie of the Year and first-time NBA All-Star was having a sensational debut campaign, averaging:\n24.3 points per game 11.0 rebounds per game 3.7 assists per game 3.8 blocks per game (leading the NBA) His unique combination of offensive firepower and defensive dominance had already placed him in elite company. Wembanyama had taken 403 three-pointers and blocked 176 shots, a statistical feat never before accomplished in NBA history—and he did it before the All-Star break.\nUnfortunately, due to falling short of the league’s new 65-game minimum rule, Wembanyama will be ineligible for major end-of-season awards, including:\nDefensive Player of the Year (where he was a heavy favorite) All-NBA Team selections All-Defensive Team honors Prior to the injury, ESPN BET had Wembanyama as a -2000 favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year, making his absence a huge shake-up in the award race.\nTeammates React to Crushing News The Spurs locker room was visibly shaken following the announcement, as Wembanyama had become not just the focal point of the team’s future but also a beloved figure among his teammates.\nVeteran point guard Chris Paul, who was brought in to mentor Wembanyama, expressed the team’s disappointment while reinforcing that his long-term health is the priority.\n“It’s tough. Tough more than anything, I think, for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play.”\nPaul also acknowledged the massive void Wembanyama’s absence creates, both on and off the court.\n“I think everybody understands that basketball is what we do and not who we are. Life and everything is so much more important. But for us, we know losing a big part of our team like that is [made up for] by committee. And trust me, you can’t replace Vic. I can’t stand on a guy’s shoulders and block every shot that comes to the rim.”\n“Aside from his basketball ability, his charisma and what he brings into the locker room I think is what we’ll miss the most.”\nA Tough Season for the Spurs Wembanyama’s season-ending diagnosis marks the second major loss for the Spurs this year. In November 2024, head coach Gregg Popovich suffered a stroke, forcing him to take an indefinite leave from coaching.\nThe Spurs, currently sitting 23-29 and 12th in the Western Conference, were already struggling before Wembanyama’s injury. His absence for the final stretch of the season all but ensures they will miss the playoffs as they shift focus to next year’s rebuild.\nThis never happened before the vax! ? pic.twitter.com/WoykcCWVEV\n— TMSPN.com (@sportsgossip) February 20, 2025 Looking Ahead For now, Wembanyama’s health and full recovery remain the top priority. While his record-breaking rookie season was cut short, his impact has already been felt across the league, and San Antonio remains committed to building its future around him.\nThe NBA world will now wait to see if the 7-foot-3 sensation can return stronger next season—and if his absence reshapes the league’s defensive hierarchy in his wake.",
