  "text": "Residents on a\nNottingham estate plagued by drugs and sex are breathing a sigh of relief after two gates were put in place to keep out anti-social offenders. Families living between Brushfield Street and Hovenden Gardens in Hyson Green were forced to deal with people using and dealing drugs, defecating and in some instances even having sex.\nAfter seven years of complaints being made to the\ncity council and police, the decision was made to install extra gates to ensure only residents were allowed access. Kevin Draper, who had been consistently raising the issue with authorities, said the estate was \"back to normal\" after the changes were made in September.\n\"It's just a nice peaceful little area to live in,\" said the 60-year-old, who has lived in the area with his wife for more than 20 years. \"We're not getting anybody outside the back gate, it's made it a much nicer place to live again.\"\nDo you feel safe in Nottingham city centre?\nLet us know here.\nRecalling the initial difficulties he had in being taken seriously, the carer said: \"The council were doing nothing and the\npolice were going through the motions. It was like banging your head against a brick wall.\n\"While this was going on, there was years of abuse, threats and knives being pulled on you. We feel safe in our own home now. It's nice seeing the kids playing out again, enjoying themselves and being kids. You can hear them having a laugh and a joke, it makes you wish you were back to being their age again.\"\nSome parents said they would not let their children play outside due to the problems with crime. However mum-of-three Zulekha Khan said things have since changed.\n\"It's quite a lot better, there's no broken glass outside, people screaming and shouting. It's much, much, much better,\" the 40-year-old said. \"It's quiet and safe again, there's no rubbish or violence.\"\nJohn Merry, 54, also said the area had improved but added that there was still an issue with \"occasional fly-tipping\" nearby.\nNottingham City Council said it had seen a \"significant reduction in anti-social behaviour and criminality\" since the installation of the gates, which cost £200.",
