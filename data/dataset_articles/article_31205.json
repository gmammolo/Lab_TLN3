  "text": "Dieticians recommend protein alternatives amidst rising egg prices\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - With rising egg prices, a registered dietitian with Aurora Health Care has other protein options for you.\nHer name is Heather Klug. She says if you’re avoiding eggs due to how expensive they are, consider other options.\nFor example: plant proteins, soy milk, nuts, and whole grains. Skipping out on protein altogether is not the best option.\n“If you’re just having something with carbohydrates in it even if it’s a health carbohydrate your body is done digesting and absorbing those nutrients in like probably 2 hours at the most - so your blood sugars go up -they plateau and come back down - and we all know what that feels like - that’s when you want to eat again,” SAID KLUG.\nKlug says protein is important to stay feeling full and energized. It’s a part of the balance your body needs.\nCopyright 2025 WBAY. All rights reserved.",
