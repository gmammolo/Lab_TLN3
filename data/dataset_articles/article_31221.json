  "text": "(Photo courtesy of the Iowa Board of Nursing) The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued an emergency order suspending the license of a nurse who allegedly tested positive for drugs while working at an Iowa hospital in 2023. The board has charged Audrie Hubbard of Ringgold County, a registered nurse, with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs; with being involved in the unauthorized possession or use of a controlled substance; and with failing to comply with an order of the board. The board alleges that in October 2023, while working at the Greater Regional Health hospitals and clinics in Creston, Hubbard texted a coworker and indicated she had a flat tire, then failed to respond to messages from the hospital staff. According to the board, Hubbard was at work the following day when a coworker grew concerned that Hubbard was showing “signs indicating substance use.” Hubbard was allegedly asked to complete a urine drug screen and a breath test while still on duty. According to the board, the test results were positive for alcohol and marijuana use and Hubbard admitted having consumed a THC gummy. Hubbard was enrolled in an employee-assistance program but allegedly failed to stay in contact with program officials and was fired from the hospital in February 2024, according to board records. Eight months later, the Board of Nursing issued a confidential order of some unspecified nature against Hubbard. According to the board, Hubbard failed to comply with that order and has not responded to any of the board’s subsequent attempts to contact her. Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Hubbard for comment. The board alleges Hubbard has engaged in unethical behavior by practicing nursing while under the influence, by the use of a controlled substance and by failing to comply with a board order. Based on those findings, the board has determined Hubbard poses “an immediate danger to the public health, safety and welfare.” As a result, the board on Jan. 16, 2025, issued an emergency order suspending Hubbard’s license for an indefinite period and scheduled a hearing on the matter for Feb. 18, 2025. The emergency order was only made public this week and the board has not disclosed whether the hearing took place.",
