  "text": "Lakers star Luka Doncic is still getting acclimated to his new team while recovering from a major injury that forced him to be out for a chunk of the season.\nDoncic missed about six weeks with a left calf strain he suffered in his final game with the Mavericks on Christmas Day. The forward returned to action in his first game with Los Angeles on Feb. 10 against the Jazz .\nAfter the All-Star break, the Lakers opened with a game on Wednesday vs. the Hornets before traveling to Portland for a back-to-back on Thursday. Therefore, the Lakers are choosing to ease Doncic back into game action as they resume their season.\nHere's the latest injury update on Doncic's status.\n| |\nIs Luka Doncic playing tonight? The Lakers ruled Luka Doncic out for Thursday night's game against the Trail Blazers with left calf injury management.\nDoncic played on Wednesday night vs. Charlotte, totaling 14 points and 11 rebounds in 33 minutes of action, his highest workload since returning from injury. Los Angeles seemed to choose to rest Doncic on the back-to-back so he doesn't aggravate the injury.\nWith Doncic out, that means that both Lakers stars might miss the game as LeBron James is also \"questionable\" with left foot injury management\nLakers schedule 2025 Date Opponent Time Feb. 20 @ Portland Trail Blazers 10:00 p.m. ET Feb. 22 @ Denver Nuggets 8:30 p.m. ET Feb. 25 vs. Dallas Mavericks 10:00 p.m. ET Feb. 27 vs. Minnesota Timberwolves 10:30 p.m. ET Feb. 28 vs. Los Angeles Clippers 10:00 p.m. ET",
