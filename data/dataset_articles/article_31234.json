  "text": "Malcolm Brogdon Out Of Action For Friday\n1 min agoWashington Wizards guard\nSource:\nMalcolm Brogdon(ankle) will be unavailable for Friday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks. The veteran guard suffered a sprained ankle right before the All-Star break. Brogdon has battled several injuries this season, playing in just 24 games. However, the 32-year-old has been relatively productive when available, averaging 12.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists in 23.5 minutes per contest.Jordan Poole, Carlton Carrington, andBilal Coulibalywill likely see plenty of extra playing time and scoring opportunities with Brogdon on the shelf.Source:\nNBA Injury ReportMore Player News from RotoBaller\nRead More News",
