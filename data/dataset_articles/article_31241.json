  "text": "A Mattanawcook Academy player suffered a medical incident after a collision during the Lynx’s Class C North semifinal against Dexter.\nThe player dove for a loose ball and collided with a Dexter player. She appeared to have convulsions and was down on the court for about 20 minutes.\nShe was attended to by several individuals including EMTs.\nAfter 20 minutes, she was helped to her feet and placed in a medical chair and wheeled out of the Cross Insurance Center by EMTs for further evaluation. She appeared to be alert.\nA Bangor firefighter confirmed an ambulance was sent to the Cross Insurance Center, but could not share additional details.\nBangor High School Principal Paul Butler was on site Thursday for the Maine Principals’ Association, which runs the tournament. He said the player “appeared to strike her head on the floor” and seemed to experience a period of semi-consciousness.\nButler called the incident “very scary” and said that type of situation doesn’t happen often. He noted that there was a “quick response” from athletic trainers and medical personnel, and said there were good signs the player would be OK.\nMattanawcook Athletic Director Jeremy Weatherbee provided the Bangor Daily News with an update on the player’s condition Thursday night.\n“She’s in good spirits and doing better,” Weatherbee said.\nBDN reporter Marie Weidmayer contributed to this report.",
