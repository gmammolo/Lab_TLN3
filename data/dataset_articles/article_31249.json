  "text": "There are many ways today’s senior citizens are mistreated or disrespected, but one of the most severe is denial of medical care they paid for.\nAs a 38-year resident of this community and a 35-year volunteer on various boards and commissions, it was shocking to me that when my wife fell and was severely injured—while she received excellent care from the entire team of ER doctors, hospital doctors, resident medical students, ER and hospital nursing teams and therapists, as well as hospital management—United Healthcare, against recommendations from her doctors and entire medical team, is forcing her release from the hospital and denying acute physical therapy care at Los Robles East Campus facility.\nMy employer and I pay significant premiums for family coverage, only to find that artificial intelligence and bureaucrats denied care after repeated requests from hospital personnel and medical staff.\nViolence and physical retaliation directed at corporate executives is never the answer; however, good people must do whatever is necessary within the law to stop the scams, extortion and abuse perpetuated by United Healthcare.\nIn the past 29 years, nearly half a million dollars was taken by United Healthcare by myself and the company I work for; half of that was $244,000 from me directly. This amount does not include the thousand upon thousands of dollars paid by me directly that was not covered by United Healthcare. This also doesn’t include the tens of thousands of dollars taxed by Medicare over 53 years of working.\nThis financial shakedown must stop. Please write local, state and national officials and your local press, our voices must be heard, to save us all.\nRick Lemmo\nNewbury Park",
