  "text": "THURSDAY, Feb. 20, 2025 (HealthDay News) -- New numbers have been released by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) in an update on the measles outbreak in Gaines County and the surrounding communities: 58 individuals, including at least 48 children and six adults, have been infected as of Feb. 18.\nGaines County remains the hotspot of the outbreak (45 cases), but surrounding counties are also beginning to see cases: nine cases in Terry County, two in Yoakum County, one in Lynn County, and one in Lubbock County. Most cases have been identified among unvaccinated individuals; however, four individuals say they have been vaccinated. Symptom onset began within the last three weeks, and so far, 13 patients have been hospitalized.\nFree vaccination clinics for the community are being hosted by the local health departments in West Texas. At a clinic hosted by the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, there have been at least 95 measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations, according to Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, CNN reported . The clinic is currently operating with expanded hours and is now open seven days a week for vaccinations.\nEarlier this year, the Houston Health Department confirmed two cases of measles in Harris County residents, which were the first measles cases reported in Texas since 2023 and prompted a DSHS health alert on Jan. 23 .\nHealth officials at the DSHS warn that additional cases are likely to occur in Gaines County and the surrounding communities. In its health alert summary, the DSHS advises clinicians to \"immediately report any suspected cases to your local health department, preferably while the patient is in your presence.\"\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 2023 to 2024 school year saw the highest level of vaccine exemptions for kindergarteners ( 3.3 percent ). The DSHS notes that in Gaines County, the number was much higher, at 17.62 percent (nearly one in five children).\nMore Information\nOriginally published on healthday.com , part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange .\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Tags Infectious Disease Physician’s Briefing Consumer News Spc_infectious Disease Spc_pediatrics Spc_family Practice Spc_internal Medicine Spc_emergency Medicine Spc_pathology Recommended for you Currently in Bangor\n27° Mostly Cloudy 31° / 4° 6 PM 25° 7 PM 24° 8 PM 23° 9 PM 22° 10 PM 22° Storm Cancellations\nSubmit Cancellations Here Trending Articles Videos Articles Seven Charged In Mahomes, Kelce, Burrow Burglaries Maine's top federal prosecutor fired Nautica Malone Called Brother Before Committing Suicide, Left Note For Wife Man arrested shortly after fleeing from authorities Unity family will rebuild flower shop after unprecedented community support following fire New pet justice law proposed in Maine Woman sentenced in wrong-way crash Karen Read and Ana Walshe: Love-tangled murder cases intertwine with state trooper linked to sultry texts Bangor man fatally struck by vehicle For nearly 20 years, one man has been the voice of Hancock County High School basketball: 'you can never tell what's going to happen' Videos What's on Tonight?
