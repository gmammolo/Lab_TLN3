  "text": "The life of Erika Yanira Morales, a 20 -year -old girl from Pasto, Nariño, took a drastic turn after a violent attack in a disco in 2021. With only 17 years, two women hit her in the head with a bottle, causing her a heart attack Multiple brain that left it quadriplegic. Since then, his health has worsened and has expressed his desire to access euthanasia, arguing that his suffering is unbearable.\nHis sister, Tatiana Morales, has reported through social networks the drama that the family has lived. “From the first diagnosis, doctors told us there was no hope of recovery,” he explained in a Live on Facebook. Despite the efforts to give you medical care and improve your quality of life, Erika has several times her desire to end her pain in a dignified way.\nYou can see: the tragic murder of former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear and her husband: only her 5 -year -old daughter survived the attack\nYoung Colombaian asks Euthanasia: The medical and economic difficulties of her family Since Erika was quadriplegic, her mother assumed not only her care, but also the family’s economic burdens. The young woman needs permanent assistance, medical equipment, specialized nurses, supplies such as diapers and creams, as well as a room adapted for her condition. However, his family has denounced failures in the health service, particularly with the IPS in charge of his current care.\nTatiana Morales said that the new IPS has been poor in the provision of the service. “The medical staff who attends it only goes 10 times a month, when you should receive daily attention,” he said. In addition, Erika has suffered complications such as pressure ulcers and accelerated weight loss, which has aggravated her state of health.\nDespite your family’s efforts to guarantee adequate attention, lack of resources and difficult access to a specialized medical team have further complicated the situation. “What my sister needs most is not money, but a trained medical team that gives her the attention she requires,” Tatiana insisted.\nYou can see: “You are already with mom and brothers, you left me alone”: the emotional farewell of Viola Dorantes to her sister, paquita the neighborhood\nThe struggle for decent death: the application of euthanasia Given the constant deterioration of his state of health, Erika Morales made the difficult decision to request euthanasia. In a letter addressed to his family, he expressed his exhaustion: “Virtually alive for mechanical breathing, I am tired of depending on everyone.”\nHowever, his request was rejected by EPS EMSSANAR, under the argument that it was his mother who made the request and not the patient directly. According to the regulations in force in Colombia, the procedure must be requested freely and informed by the interested person, which has generated an additional obstacle to Erika and his family.\nEuthanasia in Colombia is regulated by the Ministry of Justice, which establishes that only adults with a serious or incurable illness, which causes them intense physical or psychic suffering, can access the procedure. Despite his condition, Erika faces bureaucratic obstacles that prevent her from exercising her right to die with dignity\nYou can see: under 2 years old was found after more than a month was missing: her mother was killed in Bogotá, Colombia\nThe emotional impact on the family and the lack of answers The case of Erika Morales has left a deep mark on her family. His sister Tatiana has admitted that accepting her decision has been a difficult process. “For me it is very hard because I am not prepared for my sister to split (…), but I already accepted it, I don’t want to see her suffer anymore,” he confessed.\nFor its part, Erika’s mother is still in charge of her care, while fighting to find solutions to the lack of support of the EPS and the medical complications facing her daughter. “The attention it receives is minimal and not enough,” he denounced.\nThe case has opened again the debate on failures in the health system in Colombia, especially with regard to the rights of patients with chronic diseases and severe disabilities. The family expects their history to motivate the authorities to improve health services and guarantee real access to dignified death.",
