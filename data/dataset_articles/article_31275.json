  "text": "As a mental health therapist and ADHD certified clinical services provider, I am alarmed at the Trump’s administration’s recent attack on medication for the treatment of ADHD.\nADHD affects executive functioning which includes difficulties with organization, time management, prioritization, working memory, and emotional regulation. Stimulants help with attention, focus, staying on task, motivation, and they help decrease impulsivity. There is a large body of research to support this. Treatment of ADHD decreases anxiety, depression, substance use, motor vehicle accidents, work and school failure, sexual risk-taking, and even suicidality in this population.",
