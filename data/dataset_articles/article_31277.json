  "text": "Rise in culex population: Mosquito menace continues\nDespite a drop in dengue cases due to the winter chill, city dwellers continue to suffer from an alarming rise in mosquito infestations, with authorities failing to take effective measures to control the surge in Culex mosquitoes.\nExperts warn that without immediate intervention, the Culex mosquito population will keep increasing until March.\nThey also stressed the importance of targeting Aedes mosquitoes during this period by identifying dengue-positive households and launching preemptive mosquito control drives.\nResidents across the capital are struggling to cope with the mosquito menace.\nSaiful Alam, a resident of Mirpur-12, said it has become nearly impossible to sleep at night without a mosquito net or repellent. \"I often have to use mosquito repellent even during the day just to protect myself,\" he added.\nSabakat Sabris Sami, an HSC candidate from East Shewrapara, said, \"Mosquito numbers have increased dramatically recently. We have not seen any anti-mosquito drives in our area for weeks.\"\nMd Kamal, a resident of Dhalkanagar Lane in Gandaria, echoed him.\nEntomologist Kabirul Bashar said, \"Cleaning drains and waterbodies and applying larvicide simultaneously is the key to controlling mosquitoes. However, simply applying larvicide without cleaning the drains will not yield results.\"\nEntomologist GM Saifur Rahman said, \"There is no specific body to take effective measures against mosquitoes. If we can eliminate breeding sites such as canals, stagnant waterbodies, and lakes, we can solve 70 percent of the problem.\"\nHe said last year's failure to control Aedes mosquitoes resulted in a nationwide dengue outbreak.\n\"If the authorities locate and destroy Aedes mosquito breeding clusters now, it will be much easier to control their population during the peak season,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, entomologist Monzur A Chowdhury highlighted the importance of tackling Aedes mosquitoes during the winter lull.\n\"The number of Aedes mosquitoes has decreased due to the cold weather. This is the perfect time to identify dengue-affected households and conduct extensive anti-mosquito drives around them to eliminate breeding sources and adult mosquitoes,\" he said.\nDNCC Chief Health Officer Brig Gen Imru-al-Quais, speaking at a programme at Nagar Bhaban, said apart from their regular anti-mosquito drives, they have their own surveillance system to control Aedes mosquitoes.\n\"We have also formed an expert committee to oversee the situation,\" he said.\nRegarding Culex mosquitoes, Dr Md Emdadul Hoque, health officer of DNCC, said they have strengthened anti-mosquito drives in areas from where complaints were received.\n\"Since this is a transitional period, the Culex population has increased slightly but not to an alarming level,\" he claimed.\nOfficials of Dhaka city corporations said their routine anti-mosquito drives are ongoing.",
