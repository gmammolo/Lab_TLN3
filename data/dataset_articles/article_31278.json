  "text": "Harbor seal at New Bedford zoo dies after contracting bird flu, officials say Email to a Friend\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nPrint this Article\nView Comments Blue, a 21-year-old harbor seal, suddenly passed last week at the Buttonwood Park Zoo Buttonwood Park Zoo A harbor seal at the Buttonwood Park Zoo in New Bedford died earlier this month after contracting the avian flu, officials said.\nBlue, a 21-year-old male Atlantic harbor seal, died on Feb. 5, the zoo announced on social media. It was later determined that he had succumbed to complications caused by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, likely contracted through contact with an infected wild bird.\n“Avian flu continues to affect a range of wild and domesticated animal populations, including residents at zoos across the country, so the recent event at BPZOO is, regrettably, far from unique,” zoo officials wrote Wednesday.\nZoo officials said there is “no risk” to the public. They added that the zoo’s other two seals, Conway and Luna, were separated from Blue as soon as symptoms appeared, and both remain in good health.\nAdvertisement",
