  "text": "The weather has been atrocious, just in case you haven’t noticed. A friend in Buffalo has sent us photos that make us very glad we live in North Carolina. But even in the south, the weather has been unseasonably cold. Here is a photo of our rain gauge yesterday.\nYes, we had quite the snowstorm yesterday.\nHands are dry, rough and cracked and spring is weeks away.\nPart of the problem is hand washing. We are told by public health officials that we must wash our hands frequently to avoid catching colds or flu. That means washing after shaking hands, touching the elevator buttons or doorknobs or even cell phones. Let’s face it, viruses linger on surfaces for hours. But all that hand washing wreaks havoc, especially when air is dry. What can we do to overcome sandpaper skin?\nSuggestions from Visitors to this Website:\n“I’ve suffered from cracked fingers for several years now. I am a preschool teacher, so not only do I wash my hands a lot, I’m always making and playing with play dough, painting or using other such materials with the children.\nI’ve tried many different kinds of lotions and treatments and nothing seems to work. I have jars and tubes of Corn Huskers, Aquaphor, Aveeno Hand Cream, Eucerin and the list goes on.\n“We have ‘teacher soap’ at school that is not antibacterial and I put lotion on each time I wash my hands. Liquid Bandage has been helpful; even though the cracks don’t heal, Liquid Bandage keeps them from bleeding and the cracks don’t get deeper.” K.J.L.\n“Start at the source of why your hands are dry and cracking…drying soaps and dry air.\n“Bring your own soap to school. Bar soaps are better than liquid for dry skin. I LOVE Neolia, an olive oil-based soap. It is hard to find in stores but you can get it direct from the manufacturer. Or try Cetaphil, a skin-cleansing lotion that doesn’t contain soap or detergent.\n“Always wear gloves when washing dishes or working with any kind of detergent. Use a humidifier in your home and the classroom.\n“Ointments are the most moisturizing over creams and lotions. I prefer Aquaphor Healing Ointment. My dad says Burt Bee’s Shea Butter Hand Repair Creme and Hand Salve are excellent. Good luck!” Candice\n“The best thing is to moisturize following each hand washing, to prevent the problem. I like to put a small amount of olive oil on my cuticles; massage it in, followed by any good, thick moisture cream. The cream mixes nicely with the oil, aiding the absorption.\n“If I neglect to do this even once during the winter, I get the cracks and split cuticles.” T.S.\n“I am a needlework and quilt designer. Working with threads and fabrics takes a toll on my hands; plus I have dry skin.\n“I’ve been using Udderly Smooth Udder Cream for years. Since I started using it I have not had problems with cracked fingers. Plus, I think it helps my fingernails, which is an added benefit. It is also non-greasy, so I can work with my threads and fabrics without leaving a greasy mark. My husband loves it too!” Karen\n“I do not have serious eczema but it arises periodically on my hands. I have tried all of the remedies that I know of, including dietary restrictions.\n“The one that cleared my eczema quickly and thoroughly was Udderly Smooth Extra Care 20, with 20% Urea. I was amazed at the almost instant pain relief, followed by total clearing within a few days.\n“The Udderly Smooth cream without the urea was good for simple dry skin but didn’t cure the eczema. I ordered this product for those on my Christmas list and highly recommend it to anyone with eczema or any other skin problem. Thank you, once again, People’s Pharmacy!” TTPOL\nRedex Industries, the makers of Udder Cream, underwrite our radio show. That means we have a clear conflict of interest. On the other hand, we think 20% urea is a fabulous ingredient that helps speed healing of dry, cracked skin. Research dermatologists have endorsed urea for its protective effect.\nWe put together a Winter Skin Survival Kit that contains a handy two-ounce tube of Udderly Smooth Extra Care 20 Cream for pocket or pocket book, an eight-ounce tub of Extra Care 20 cream for home use and three tubes of our People’s Pharmacy Pomegranate Natural Lip Care. You save 15% on this kit compared to the price of the individual products. There is also a free eight-page Guide to Skin Care and Treatment with additional tips on keeping skin healthy this winter. Here is a link to the Winter Skin Survival Kit. It would make a great gift for the holidays.",
