  "text": "PHOENIX (AZFamily) — Since pledging the United States government would only recognize two genders during his inauguration, President Donald Trump has signed several executive orders impacting the transgender community. One directive aims to restrict access to gender-related health care treatments for children.\nIn response, Phoenix Children’s Hospital is indefinitely halting all hormone therapy and puberty blockers for its patients.\nParents of transgender children who have been receiving care from the provider are scrambling.\n“She is devastated right now because she feels that she’s being targeted because she cannot be herself,” said the mother of an 18-year-old transgender daughter who wishes to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation for speaking out.\nShe said her daughter has been receiving hormone therapy at Phoenix Children’s for a couple of years.\n“This isn’t something that is taken lightly we didn’t just wake up one day and say ‘oh we’re gonna put our daughter on hormone therapy,’” she said.\nFamilies like hers are in limbo after Trump signed an executive order that intends to restrict access to transgender medical interventions for people under 19.\n“People who have gender differences should be respected. They should be loved, but loving them, sometimes love means saying no to people,” said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, during his Senate confirmation hearing.\n“The fact that any government would dare question my parenting skills,” said the transgender mother Arizona’s Family spoke with. “They have no business in our home and in my parenting.”\nTo comply with the president’s directive, Phoenix Children’s shared a letter with patients last week, which says the gender clinic is “indefinitely pausing gender-affirming medical care, specifically puberty-blocking and gender-affirming hormonal therapy.”\n“They’re suffering. They don’t feel safe. They’re afraid to leave their homes,” said Andi Young, a mother of a 17-year-old transgender son and a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ care. “Accessing gender-affirming care is life-saving.”\nWithout it, there’s concern about reversing progress.\n“That I’m gonna have to be that parent again that’s gonna be like opening the bedroom door hoping that she’s still alive,” said an anonymous parent through tears.\nLegal challenges to Trump’s executive order are ongoing. Protests outside children’s hospitals and lawsuits have been reported across the country.\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said her office is reviewing the constitutionality of this executive order but can’t comment further at this time.\nPrisma Health Community Care is one option for parents seeking alternate care in Phoenix.\nPrisma initially suspended hormone therapy but resumed care after a federal district court blocked enforcement of the president’s executive order.\nWhat the Valley health care providers are saying Phoenix Children’s Hospital Phoenix Children’s is bound by all federal laws and regulations for the provision of care to its patients. For this reason, Phoenix Children’s is indefinitely pausing hormone therapy services within the Gender Clinic to ensure we are in full compliance with the recent executive order.",
