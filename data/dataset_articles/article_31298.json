  "text": "WILLEMSTAD – A surgeon at Curaçao Medical Center (CMC) has been suspended for eight months, with four months conditional, due to negligence in post-operative care of a patient. The Medical Disciplinary Board had initially issued a reprimand, but the Court of Justice imposed a stricter penalty on appeal. The Inspectorate of Public Health was involved in the case, highlighting the severity of the accusations.\nThe case dates back to 2009, when the patient underwent surgery at the now-closed Taams Clinic. While the court ruled that the surgical procedure itself was not flawed, the surgeon's post-operative care was deemed careless. The patient was discharged too early, her complaints were downplayed, and elevated blood values were ignored. Additionally, the transfer of her medical records was handled poorly, and she was not properly informed about her condition.\nThe Court described the surgeon’s actions as indifferent and unprofessional. Due to the lack of proper care in Curaçao, the patient was forced to seek treatment in Venezuela. While the court acknowledged the long duration of the legal process, the severity of the negligence ultimately led to the harsh suspension.\nThe Medical Disciplinary Board in Curaçao has the authority to impose various disciplinary measures on healthcare providers for negligence or misconduct. The harshest penalty is removal from the medical register (BIG-register), effectively banning the doctor from practicing. Other possible sanctions include a warning, reprimand, fines up to €4,500, or suspensions of up to one year. In this case, the eight-month suspension is a significant punishment, though not the maximum possible.",
