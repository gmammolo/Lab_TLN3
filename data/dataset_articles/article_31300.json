  "text": "Columbia — A Columbia physician pleaded guilty in federal court on Thursday to making false statements related to healthcare matters.\nAccording to a news release from the Department of Justice, between January 2018 and December 2019, Dr. Jerry Joseph Bruggeman, 53, referred over 3,100 orders for cancer and pharmacological genetic testing, as well as durable medical equipment for Medicare beneficiaries, who reported that they did not know him and did not seek Bruggeman's services.\nThe genetic testing orders signed by Bruggeman resulted in Medicare paying a total of $1,055,303, while the orders for durable medical equipment under Medicare accounted for $551,105 in additional payments.\nIn total, Bruggeman's orders for genetic testing and durable medical equipment caused Medicare to disburse $1,606,408.\nBetween approximately January 31, 2018, and April 2019, Bruggeman received around $29,440 in compensation from a telehealth company for the orders he signed through an online portal.\nThe company created medical assessments and orders for Medicare beneficiaries, then hired medical professionals like Bruggeman to “review” and sign orders for cancer genetic testing, pharmacogenetic testing, and durable medical equipment.\nHowever, Bruggeman did not interact with the patients prior to signing the forms.\nBruggeman faces a sentence of up to five years in federal prison without the possibility of parole.",
