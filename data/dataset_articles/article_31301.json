  "text": "VICTOR Wembanyama's impressive sophomore NBA season came to a shocking end on Friday when the San Antonio Spurs' cornerstone was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis during the league's All-Star break.\nThe 7-foot-3 Frenchman, according to reports, has been feeling weak of late and decided to go for tests after playing in the mid-season All-Stars. The tests revealed the blood-clot disorder that rudely cut short his season.\nREAD Amid NBA trade frenzy, Jordan Clarkson somehow stays a Jazz\n\"The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Victor Wembanyama has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder,\" his team said in a statement released on Friday (Manila time).\n\"The condition was discovered when Wembanyama returned to San Antonio following the All-Star Game in San Francisco. Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 season,\" the Spurs added.\nUntil the injury, Wembanyama was averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds and 3.8 blocks per game this season in 46 games and looked a cinch for NBA Defensive Player of the Year honors and a contender for his first All-NBA First Team spot.\nWith him as anchor, the Spurs have won 23 games and are on track for at least an appearance in the play-in matches.\nAll that, however, will have to take a backseat as the 21-year old super rookie deals with the same ailment that led to the retirement of former Miami Heat star Chris Bosh.\nBut in Wembanyama's case, reports coming out of San Antonio revealed that the outlook for recovery is much brighter and that the Spurs expect him to be back in full fitness to start afresh next NBA season,\nGet more of the latest sports news & updates on SPIN.ph",
