  "text": "A meeting of vaccine advisers set for late February has been postponed, a federal official confirmed on Thursday, raising new uncertainty about the Trump administration's vaccine policy after Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s installation atop the nation’s health bureaucracy.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) normally holds multiple meetings a year, reviews scientific data and makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control. It had been scheduled to convene for three days next week and take several votes, including one about how a key government vaccine distribution program should handle influenza inoculations.",
