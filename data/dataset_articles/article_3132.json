  "text": "With the New Year coming up, Carson City Sheriff's Office is taking an extra step in making sure the community stays safe, specifically their kids.\nThe sheriff's office is conducting an alcohol compliance check. This means they'll be checking in on businesses with liquor licenses and making sure they're following the law by not selling to people under 21.\nSheriff Ken Furlong says, \"This is absolutely critical. We look at DUI laws and the occurrence rates that go on and the amount of people that will take part in festivities over the weekend. Our children are just as likely to celebrate as well but we want to make sure that they celebrate responsibly and not with alcohol.\"\nAll day deputies have been sending decoys to various gas stations and liquor stores. The minors stand outside first and ask patrons to buy alcohol for the, and if that doesn't work then they'll go inside and try to purchase alcohol themselves showing their real ID that clearly shows they are underage.\nIf the store fails to check properly and sells to them anyways then the deputies come in, return the alcohol, and the store faces serious consequences.\nSheriff Furlong tells us, \"It's just shy of a $650 citation to the clerk and the community licensing will fine the store on the first offense of $100 but that offense escalates if repeated offenses take place.\"\nThe Carson City Sheriff's Office does share a report once they have finished their compliance check. We'll be sure to keep you updated if any businesses have failed that check on air and online.",
