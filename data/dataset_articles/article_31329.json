  "text": "Corewell Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids. Credit: Mark Sanchez, Crain’s Grand Rapids Business Corewell Health today confirmed that it has made administrative job cuts, but the health system remains mum on the details of those layoffs.\nIn a statement to Crain’s Grand Rapids Business, Corewell Health confirmed it recently made layoffs, but declined to identify how many jobs were affected, the kinds of positions involved, or whether it was outsourcing the work.\n“Like health systems across the country, we have made some staffing changes in some non-patient facing, administrative roles,” the health system said in the statement. “These changes will help us continue to provide high-quality care for the long term in a challenging economic environment for health care. We are grateful for the contributions and service provided by our team members.”\nSocial media posts by people who purport to be affected by the cuts indicated the layoffs involved about 190 people who worked remotely and did medical coding and billing. One poster said Corewell was outsourcing the work to “people who lived overseas.”\nKeep up with all things West Michigan business.

The company employs more than 65,000 people statewide.\nThrough the third quarter of 2024, Corewell Health recorded $211.8 million in net operating income on $12.26 billion in total operating revenue for a 1.7% operating margin, according to a quarterly statement posted on the health system’s website. That compares to $152.1 million in net operating income on $11.18 billion in total operating revenue for the first nine months of 2023 for a 1.4% operating margin.\nOf the operating revenue, $6.85 billion came from health care delivery, and the 1.3-millon-member health plan Priority Health generated $5.17 billion on policy premiums.\nStrong investment income through the first nine months of 2024 raised net income through the third quarter to $895.8 million.\nCorewell Health posts its quarterly and annual financial statements under an agreement that accommodated the 1997 merger that created the former Spectrum Health, which three years ago merged with Southfield-based Beaumont Health.\nThe statewide health system also has been facing increased unionization . Nearly 10,000 registered nurses in Southeast Michigan voted last fall to join the Teamsters, which has been mounting an organizing drive in West Michigan.\nA Teamsters drive last fall to organize respiratory therapists at Corewell Health’s Butterworth and Blodgett hospitals in Grand Rapids ultimately was unsuccessful. The National Labor Relations Board’s acting regional director in Detroit ruled Dec. 30 that the proposed bargaining unit was a non-conforming unit under federal rules.\nMore from Crain’s Grand Rapids Business:\nAce Pickleball Club to open 13-court facility at Grand Rapids mall\nDeVos family office sells majority stake in Boxed Water\nBlue Cross seeks dismissal of ‘phantom tax’ antitrust lawsuit tied to self-funded plans",
