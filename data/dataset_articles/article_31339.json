  "text": "Pune: In an extremely rare case, a newborn was recently diagnosed with congenital leukaemia or blood cancer at the Govt Cancer Hospital in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Born on Dec 15 last year, the girl child succumbed to the disease on Jan 30.M edical experts said the disease occurred in only one in 10-50 lakh live births. \\\"Congenital leukaemia is a rare type of blood cancer. We rummaged through medical literature from around the world and found that she might be the 200th patient globally and only the 13th diagnosed case in India,\\\" Dr Aditi Lingayat, head of the paediatric-oncology department at the hospital, said.The primary treatment for congenital leukaemia is chemotherapy. \\\"The child was the fourth pregnancy for the mother and the third successful delivery. We started chemotherapy on the infant from the 15th day of birth. I have treated more than 10,000 children in my 22-year tenure, but this is my first case of congenital leukaemia. Despite our best possible efforts to treat the infant, we could not save her,\\\" Dr Lingayat said.The child's mother is a farmer from Sayyedpur, a village in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district. \\\"The girl was born on Dec 15 last year and weighed 2.8kg. Immediately after birth, she developed black and blue spots all over her body. Neonatology department head Dr LS Deshmukh immediately started symptomatic treatment on her. Besides, we conducted blood tests on her, which confirmed congenital leukaemia,\\\" Dr Shivaji Sukre, dean at the Government Medical College, to which the hospital is attached, said.On the health condition of the child's mother, Dr Lingayat said, \\\"The mother was completely healthy and did not show any signs of cancer or any comorbidities.\\\" According to her, consuming substances like alcohol, tobacco or marijuana during pregnancy was thought to contribute to the development of congenital leukaemia. \\\"Besides, prolonged exposure to radiation through x-ray or CT scan could lead to congenital leukaemia, in addition to genetic causes,\\\" Dr Lingayat said.She said in this particular case, exposure to chemicals or fertilisers might be the causal factor as her mother was a farmer.Dr Bhausaheb Bagal, consultant medical oncologist at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, said, \\\"Congenital leukaemia is an extremely rare type of cancer, which cannot be prevented. It needs swift diagnosis.\\\"Unlike other cancers, leukaemia doesn't have distinct stages, but instead uses risk stratification to categorize the disease as high or low risk, allowing for personalised treatment plans. \\\"The first phase of treatment is very intense. Once the disease is controlled in the first month, we focus on relapse prevention. For relapse prevention, the child can either undergo chemotherapy based consolidation or a bone marrow or a stem cell transplant,\\\" Dr Bagal, who specialises in leukaemia treatment, said.Dr Arvind Gaikwad, officer on special duty at Govt Cancer Hospital, associate professor Dr Farrokh Aziz, assistant professor Dr Suyog Nagre were also involved in the diagnosis and treatment of the infant girl.",
