  "text": "The Southern University football community is grieving the death of one of its own Thursday. Sean Wallace , the Jaguars Hall of Fame player, a safeties coach for the team and former acting head coach for the program in 2023, died after battling pancreatic cancer .\nHe was 52.\n\"It is with sadness in my heart, my family, and my friends to let you know that my brother Mr. Sean Wallace has passed,\" Antoinette Wallace, his sister, said on Facebook. \"I will let everybody know when the arrangements will be made. Thank you in advance for all the comfort, thoughts and prayers.\"\nWallace went public about his fight with stage four pancreatic cancer in 2023.\nHis wife, Venio, and three children — Tonyatta, Sadijah and Abraham — all attended the 2023 Bayou Classic wearing shirts that read \"#SeanStrong.\" In that game, Wallace was the acting head coach for the Jaguars after the program parted ways with head coach Eric Dooley a week before the rivalry battle. Southern won that game 27-22.\nA native of the West Bank, the Bayou Classic was always a big deal for Wallace in the Superdome. Before landing at Southern in the 1990s, he played at O. Perry Walker High School in the Algiers neighborhood.\n\"Every time I showed up, I showed out,\" Wallace told The Advocate of his experience at the Bayou Classic. \"All four of them.\"\nCris Collinsworth, @CollinsworthPFF ,with NBC at the 1993 Bayou Classic speaking about Sean Wallace, who will be the Jaguars coach at this years 50th annual Bayou Classic. Collinsworth has been an entertaining commentator for quite some time now! pic.twitter.com/IxCSUKlvqt\n— Abraham Wallace (@thechiefabraham) November 24, 2023 Wallace returned an interception 96 yards for a touchdown and blocked a PAT attempt in the 1991 Bayou Classic, earning MVP honors in a 31-30 victory for the Jaguars.\nIn 1993, he was a standout defensive back on legendary head coach Pete Richardson's highly-regarded defense. He helped lead the way for a squad that won the SWAC title and became Black College National Champions.\nAfter earning Bayou Classic MVP, All-SWAC, SWAC Defensive Player of the Year and two-time Sheridan Black College All-American honors, he played one year in the NFL with the Arizona Cardinals before enjoying a successful career in ministry and business. He finished his degree at Southern 25 years after leaving the university once all of his kids graduated from college. In 2011, he was inducted into the Southern Athletic Hall of Fame.\nWallace didn't miss coaching a game in 2023, the year of his diagnosis.\n\"I'm going to live, so I might as well work and do my job,\" he told The Advocate that season. \"Be an example to the young men. Life may throw you a curveball and you might get knocked down, but you've got to get back up. It's just like football. A play may not work, but you've got to go to the next play.\"\nThe assistant coach said showing up to games through his condition and chemotherapy was some of his \"toughest challenges\" in his life, but the atmosphere always brought him back up.\n\"When I stepped on that football field and saw the Human Jukebox come out, it was unbelievable how much energy I got,” he said.\nIn his final Bayou Classic this past November, Wallace and the Jaguars came out victorious again in a 24-14 win.",
