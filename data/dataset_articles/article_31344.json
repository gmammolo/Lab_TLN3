  "text": "Health officials say residents may have been exposed to measles in Brampton after a case of the virus was confirmed in Peel Region earlier this week.\nPeel Public Health says it is investigating a case of measles that was confirmed on Tuesday, the region said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe confirmed case has public health warning that residents may have been exposed to the virus at the Cornerstone Medical Centre-Walk In Urgent Care and adjoining pharmacy at 8990 Chinguacousy Rd. in Brampton.\nThe exposures could have happened between 1:52 p.m. and 5:13 p.m. on Feb. 16, Peel Public Health says.\nThe highly-contagious infection of the lungs can spread easily to those who are not fully vaccinated against measles or who have not previously had measles.\nInfants under one year of age, people who are pregnant and people with weakened immune systems are at an increased risk of complications.\nAnyone who believes they have been exposed is being urged to check their immunization records and people experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider, Peel Public Health says.\n“With March break approaching, Peel Public Health advises residents to make sure they are up to date with measles vaccination, especially before international travel. All Ontarians over six months old are eligible for MMR vaccine if traveling.”\nMeasles symptoms begin a week to 21 days after infection and may include:\nHigh fever of 38.8 C or greater. Red, blotchy rash three to seven days after symptoms start. Cough. Runny nose. Red, watery eyes. Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged not to attend work or school.\n“Those concerned about symptoms should call their health care provider before going to see them to inform them they may have been in contact with someone who has measles,” Peel Public Health says.\nEarlier this month, York Region Public Health said that an individual with measles recently visited two busy spots in the Ontario town. A child also tested positive for measles in Hamilton where health officials were investigating after a school and hospital were exposed to the virus.\nFor more information on protecting yourself and family from measles visit www.PeelRegion.ca .",
