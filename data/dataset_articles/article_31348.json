  "text": "With numerous cases of avian influenza appearing in Ontario, experts are scrambling to prevent a potential mass outbreak.\nLast December, seven poultry farms in southern Ontario were quarantined due to the pathogenic avian influenza strain(s) HPAI/H5N1, colloquially known as bird flu.\nAs a byproduct of these contaminations, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) cut off the impacted areas, euthanized all potentially infected poultry, and ensured that all nearby farms were not exposed.\n“I would say we can call this an exceptional outbreak,” the CFIA’s deputy incident commander of avian influenza response, Brian Hamilton, told INsauga.com.\nWith uncharacteristic outbreaks occurring in Ontario, how safe is the province from an avian flu epidemic among humans?\nYesterday (Feb. 19), the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) released an announcement concerning the procurement of avian flu vaccines to curb what the federal government deemed as an “unprecedented” spread of the virus.\nAt the time of publication, 500,000 vaccine doses have been secured by the feds, however, only 60 per cent of the available inventory is being sent out to provinces and territories, while the other 40 per cent, will remain under lock and key in the event of a potential pandemic.\nA corresponding document from December 2024 by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) ruled that as long as the country remains in a pre-pandemic state, the distribution of these vaccines will likely prioritize those working near potential contamination scenarios.\nThese include lab workers, poultry farmers, veterinarians, and wildlife researchers.\nHowever, even with these preventative measures, experts in the field are still preparing for the worst.\n“I think to be truthful, we are underestimating the power of this virus and the predictability of it. It has proven us wrong too many times and we can’t trust it. It doesn’t respect our politics and it doesn’t respect our borders — it certainly doesn’t respect what we think we know about how to mitigate it,” Dr. Shayan Sharif, interim VP of research and innovation at Guelph University, told INsauga.com.\nSharif — who has an extensive background as a professor of immunology — has been following this current strain of avian flu since its emergence in 2020/2021.\nSharif notes that while this current pathogen in Ontario is likely to be traced back to birds from the Maritimes, as the years have progressed, complex factors have entrenched it within the province and, by extension, Canada.\nAs climate change progresses, Sharif notes that migratory birds are acting erratically, and as a result, lingering where they shouldn’t be and spreading the virus amongst both wild and agricultural avian species.\n“So if you’re in cities in Ontario right now, you are likely seeing a lot of Canadian geese or other birds, sometimes, in parks or local bodies of water. Now, is this normal for this time of year? No,” says Sharif.\nBeyond extended avian layovers in Ontario, the encroaching spring season has Sharif more concerned, as the remainder of migratory birds flooding the province will increase the likelihood of new strains and mutations.\n“It’s just getting worse and worse. This virus, like any virus, has new mutants and new strains. Most of them are H5N1 but now some are emerging as other types of avian influenza, all with new variants and genotypes,” says Sharif. “Hopefully, it will get better but it still remains a huge cause for concern, as it could potentially adapt itself to human cells.”\nWhile human transmission of avian influenza remains incredibly rare , last November, a teenage girl in B.C. was infected with the H5N1 strain and hospitalized for several months.\n“No one knows how this patient contracted the virus,” says Sharif.\nWhile the cause of transmission remains a mystery, official correspondence from the B.C. government indicated that it was likely due to an interaction with infected wild birds, not livestock.\nCurrently, the U.S. is also struggling with an outbreak of avian influenza, drastically impacting their agricultural economy.\nBoth the American Bread Belt — U.S. agricultural states — and Ontario are connected to what is known as the Mississippi Flyway, one of the world’s largest migratory avian causeways connecting the Arctic to South America.\nAs a result of this shared exposure, Jianhong Wu, professor and director for Advanced Disaster, Emergency, and Rapid Response Simulations at York University, has been closely monitoring how the virus has been spreading throughout the North American continent.\n“Southern Ontario is vulnerable, and the issue of avian flu is going very poorly south of the border. So, I think issues in the U.S. potentially impacting us are inevitable. So the only thing we really can do is increase our surveillance systems and rapid response capabilities,” Wu told INsauga.com\nDespite the province’s vulnerability, Wu did indicate that Ontario (and Canada) are in a much better position to address a potential outbreak, specifically due to lessons learned during COVID-19 — a potential throughline to yesterday’s bulk procurement of vaccines.\nHowever, what separates a potential human pathogen of avian flu from COVID-19 is that its functionality remains in the dark. Add this to the fact that the only recent reference point is one patient from last November, and alarm bells start ringing throughout the scientific community.\n“The girl who contracted avian influenza last November was in the hospital for two months,” says Sharif. “She was provided with the best possible intensive care that anyone in Canada could get — in an order of magnitude more than anyone in Canada could get. Still, she was in the hospital for two months. It was just one patient in the ICU for two months. Could you imagine if we had hundreds or thousands of people taking up hospital beds for two months? What are we going to do?”\nWhile authorities remain on high alert, those who excel in emergency response procedures like Wu believe that while a potential mass outbreak of avian flu (human or otherwise) can happen anywhere, it’s up to response forces to ensure public safety.\nAnd if they can’t ensure it, at least prepare for what happens next.\n“If this is going to happen, it’s going to happen somewhere. What we have to do then, is to slow it down and buy the province and the country some time,” he says.",
