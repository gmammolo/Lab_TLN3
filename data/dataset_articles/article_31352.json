  "text": "Canandaigua, N.Y. — The Happy Tails Animal Shelter in Canandaigua has been closed until further notice as a precautionary measure following concerns over parvovirus.\nThe closure comes in the wake of a recent animal cruelty case in Geneva, where two people — Dawn Cameron, 42, and Dustin Bush, 39 — are charged after 11 dogs were seized last Monday from poor living conditions at a home on Middle Street, according to the Ontario County Humane Society.\nSome of those dogs reportedly developed parvovirus and were placed in quarantine, where they're receiving the care they need.\nThe shelter is undergoing a thorough cleaning process to ensure the safety of all animals.\nCameron and Bush are both charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty.\nThe humane society is coordinating with veterinary technicians to ensure the best possible care for all shelter animals.\n____",
