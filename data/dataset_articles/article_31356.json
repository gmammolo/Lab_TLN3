The whole of the other side of the fence is swinging into any persons face with the wind as you turn the corner to walk along to get in the front door of houses (numbers 4 - 12 Duddington Close); where the garden from that property is open and there is a dog, also a disgusting mattress, hanging over the public pathway from the garden where you removed half the fence - it’s windy outside please can someone attend to make this safe\nUpdates\n-\nThank you for your report, this is now being investigated. Information on our services and the timeframes we aim to respond in can be found:\nhttp://www.bromley.gov.uk/ fixservicesState changed to: In progress\nPosted by Bromley Council at 22:30 today\nProvide an update\nYour information will only be used in accordance with our privacy policy",
