  "text": "The drug Tramadol made the headlines today after the NBA suspended Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr without pay for 25 games on Thursday after he tested positive.\nAccording to the International Testing Agency, Tramadol is a synthetic opioid pain medication on the prohibited list which can enhance physical performance.\nMark Bartelstein, the CEO of Priority Sports & Entertainment which represents Portis Jr, said the forward took the wrong medication.\nBobby Portis Jr. has been suspended for 25 games for violating the terms of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program by testing positive for Tramadol, the league announced today.\nPortis Jr.’s suspension will begin with tonight’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) February 20, 2025 “Bobby unintentionally took a pain medication called Tramadol, thinking he was taking a pain medication called Toradol,” Bartelstein told the media.\n“Toradol is an approved pain medication that he has used previously and that teams and players use for pain and inflammation at times. Tramadol, however, is not an approved pain medication.\nFull screen Bobby Portis #9 of the Milwaukee Bucks STACY REVERE AFP “The Tramadol pill he took came from an assistant of his, with a valid prescription for the painkiller, which he mistakenly told Bobby was Toradol... This has been incredibly difficult for him, but he will accept this penalty with grace.”\nWhat is Tramadol? Tramadol belongs to the group of medicines called opioid analgesics . It acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. When tramadol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence.\nSome of the side-effects of the drug are difficulty with breathing, confusion, more than usual sleepiness. Tramadol can also decrease fertility in men and women.",
