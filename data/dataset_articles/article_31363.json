  "text": "Kiley & House GOP would risk health coverage for 107,000 people in CA-03\nWith inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Kevin Kiley and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.”\nLast week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid.\nDespite campaigning on making life more affordable for Californians, Kiley is poised to do just the opposite.\nDCCC Spokesperson Courtney Rice:\n“Kevin Kiley knows exactly what he is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.”\n###",
