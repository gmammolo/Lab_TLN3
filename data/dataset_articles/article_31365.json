  "text": "De La Cruz & House GOP would risk health coverage for 27,000 people in TX-15 With inflation rising and the price of eggs hitting all time highs, Monica De La Cruz and House Republicans are scheming to rip away health coverage for millions of American families to fund tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations. House Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on the GOP bait and switch, telling Punchbowl News that he intends to cut Medicaid: “We have a stewardship obligation to root that out and eliminate it.” Last week, far-right Republicans scored a huge victory when the Budget Committee adopted an amendment that ensured Republicans would seek at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to vital programs like Medicaid. Despite campaigning on making life more affordable for Texans, De La Cruz is poised to do just the opposite. DCCC Spokesperson Nebeyatt Betre: “Monica De La Cruz knows exactly what she is doing. After Republicans accepted millions of dollars from billionaires like Elon Musk, they are choosing to screw over hardworking families with cruel cuts to Medicaid in order to fund tax breaks for their same billionaire backers.” ###",
