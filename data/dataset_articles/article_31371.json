  "text": "As Texas continues to contend with a growing measles outbreak that has sickened 58 and counting, other states have begun reporting their own cases of the highly contagious disease. Two other states, New Mexico and Georgia, have also reached \"outbreak\" status as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, meaning they have reported three or more related cases of the disease. But with the CDC only updating case numbers monthly, the task of tracking and announcing the spread has fallen to individual states in the weeks between. The Texas Department of State Health Services announced Tuesday that confirmed infections were up to 58, mostly in children. All but four case involve unvaccinated people or people with unknown vaccination status, and most occurred in far West Texas in Gaines County, which has a 17.62% rate of vaccine exemptions in K-12 students, according to 2023-2024 state data. In New Mexico, the number is up to nine, the New Mexico Department of Health confirmed to USA TODAY Thursday, all in Lea County, which is just across from the Texas state line and Gaines County. Four of those infected are under the age of 18 and unvaccinated, while the other five are adults, also of unvaccinated or unknown vaccination status, reported the Las Cruces Sun News, part of the USA TODAY Network. Meanwhile Georgia officials confirmed to USA TODAY on Thursday that the state still has three confirmed cases. The Rhode Island health department says the state has one case, while Alaska confirmed the state has two. Other states have reported cases but have not updated numbers in days or weeks and did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for confirmation Thursday. These include New Jersey , which confirmed one case on Feb. 14, and New York, where one case was reported by the CDC as part of its last update on Feb. 7. See measles data: Measles cases are on the rise, mostly among unvaccinated people. Know the symptoms Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus that primarily, and most severely, affects children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , it infects the respiratory tract before spreading throughout the body. The virus is highly contagious; so contagious, in fact, that 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed end up contracting it. Additionally, one in five of those people end up hospitalized, according to the CDC. Measles is spread through contact with infected nasal or throat secretions, according to WHO. It is airborne and most commonly spread through actions like coughing, sneezing or breathing. The measles virus can remain contagious in the air or on contaminated surfaces for up to two hours. According to the CDC , measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and typically include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Measles rash appears three to five days after the onset of the first symptoms.
