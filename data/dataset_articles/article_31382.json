  "text": "Stress is One of The Leading Factors For Increased Heart Disease 7 hours ago Juliana Pelaez , FARGO, N.D. (KVRR) — Heart Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It can affect anyone with a variety of symptoms.\nThe cause comes from stress.\n“The body releases hormones, stress hormones when the body is exposed to chronic stress, adrenaline, and cortisol. These hormones are good in small amounts and for a short period of time. But in the long run it can really cause high blood pressure and it can cause inflammation in the body,” said Mariela Kirk, Nurse Practitioner in Cardiology at Sanford.\nStress affects both the mind and the body leading to raised blood pressure and heart rate. While for some people stress may appear for a short time, it may appear to others over an extended period.\n“There are two types of stress, acute and chronic. Acute stress it can be even seen as good stress. But chronic stress is a stress that lasts for days, for weeks, for months. And that’s the stress that we that the heart is affected by,” said Kirk.\nKirk says that while stress may affect people in their everyday lives it can be managed.\n“The main thing is physical exercise. You know we have to do activities that help us with our cardiovascular health and also strength exercise so aerobic and strength exercises are both good for the heart and for the mental health,” said Kirk.\nKirk recommends checking in with your primary care provider yearly to check on your blood pressure.\nFind more information on how to handle stress you can visit Sanford Health .\nCategories : Community , Health , Local News , North Dakota News Tags : Cardiology , Chronic Stress , Heart disease , Mariela Kirk Nurse Practitioner , Physical Exercise , stress Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Tumblr",
