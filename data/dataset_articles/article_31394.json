  "text": "Just as Victor Wembanyama was coming off his first NBA All-Star appearance, the basketball world got the news Thursday that the Spurs ' 21-year-old star would miss the rest of the 2024-25 season.\nWembanyama — who is dealing with a deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder according to ESPN's Shams Charania — was in the midst of a dominant sophomore campaign, averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds and a league-leading 3.8 blocks per game.\nWhile Wembanyama's season-ending injury is disappointing for the Spurs and the NBA in general, it may also have further implications on his financial future.\nHere's how Wembanyama missing the rest of the 2024-25 season could affect his potential contract extension with San Antonio in the coming years.\nMORE: The latest injury updates on Victor Wembanyama\nVictor Wembanyama contract extension Wembanyama, in his second season after being selected first overall by San Antonio in the 2023 NBA Draft, has two years left on his rookie deal. Per Spotrac , he'll carry a $13,376,880 cap hit in 2025-26, then a $16,868,246 cap hit in 2026-27, when the Spurs are likely to exercise his team option.\nIn the 2026 offseason, Wembanyama will become eligible for a five-year, $271 million rookie extension, per ESPN . The star center could still increase the value of that extension to $326 million, but his recent injury will make that a bit tougher.\nBecause he'll miss the rest of the season, Wembanyama will be ineligible for NBA awards, including the Defensive Player of the Year award he was heavily favored to earn , as he'll play in fewer than 65 games.\nThe consequence of that missed time, and lack of awards, will extend into Wembanyama's future extension. Due to what's called the NBA's \"Rose rule,\" Wembanyama will have to have an elite 2026-27 season to increase his extension by more than $50 million in total.\nMORE: How Victor Wembanyama's injury could impact Spurs' Draft Lottery chances\nWhat is the Rose rule? The NBA has a rule in its CBA that doesn't officially have a name but is commonly referred to as the Rose rule — named after Derrick Rose, who won the 2011 MVP award in his third NBA season with the Bulls .\nUnder the Rose rule, players that are finishing their rookie contracts, as Wembanyama will be in a few years, are able to sign a maximum-salary contract that exceeded the usual limit for an NBA player with under seven years of experience. Rather than the usual 25%, these players on rookie contracts are eligible to sign a max contract worth 30% of the salary cap.\nYet only players that meet certain awards criteria in their first few seasons are eligible for the expanded max contracts under the Rose rule. Per Hoops Rumors , a player becomes eligible for the 30% max contract entering their fifth season when at least one of the following is true:\nThe player was named to an All-NBA team in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Defensive Player of the Year in the most recent season, or in two of the past three seasons. The player was named Most Valuable Player in any of the past three seasons. The Rose rule max extension can only be applied to extensions lasting at least four new years. Teams also do not have to sign a player to the 30% max contract even if they're eligible, as they could also agree to a deal in the 25-30% range of the salary cap — 30% is just the max.\nPlayers can also agree to conditional salaries that hinge on the player's performance in their fourth season, which is before the extension begins, based on which All-NBA team the player lands on.\nIn Wembanyama's case, he will not have any All-NBA appearances, Defensive Player of the Year awards or MVP awards by the end of the 2024-25 season (his second season) due to his season-ending injury and him missing the 65-game threshold.\nThat means when he becomes eligible to sign his contract extension in the 2026 offseason, he will not have more than one All-NBA appearance or Defensive Player of the Year award. To become eligible for the 30% max contract extension under the Rose rule, Wembanyama would have to do at least one of the following before his fifth season in 2027-28:\nBe selected to an All-NBA team in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the Defensive Player of the Year in the 2026-27 season Be selected as the league's MVP in either the 2025-26 season or 2026-27 season Even if Wembanyama is named to an All-NBA team or wins Defensive Player of the Year in 2025-26, he would still have to do the same in 2026-27 to earn the 30% max contract, as the Rose rule requires a player to either earn those honors in two of their last three seasons or in their fourth season alone.\nThe only way Wembanyama will be able to secure his larger extension with the Spurs next season is by winning MVP. Otherwise, his contract size could entirely depend on the awards he earns in 2026-27.",
