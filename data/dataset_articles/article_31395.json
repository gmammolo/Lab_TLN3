  "text": "The Milwaukee Bucks come into the stretch run of the NBA season fifth in the Eastern Conference at 29-24, one game ahead of Detroit for sixth and one game behind Indiana for fourth. That means the final 29 games of the regular season will be huge for Milwaukee as they try to land a top-4 seed and a homecourt advantage in the first round — and to avoid falling to sixth and having to face the Knicks or (less likely) the Celtics. The Bucks are already a team that is lacking a bit in the depth department, but they will now have to navigate much of the second half of the regular season without a key contributor.",
