  "text": "The severe winter weather in Waterloo Region has not only impacted the roads, but blood donations as well. Canadian Blood Services says they have seen hundreds of last-minute cancellations due to the poor weather. Other cities across the province that were hit by the storms, including Guelph and London, are noting donations being cancelled.\nThe drop in donations also means that optimal levels for blood products, such as whole blood and plasma, are down. The most recent update from Canadian Blood Services shows four blood types, including A-, B-, O+ and O- are all below the eight-day supply nationally.\nRelated:\nLarge demand for blood donations this holiday season in Waterloo Region ‘Not a big deal,’ says Laurier employee logging his 70th blood donation With elective surgeries ramping up, blood donations are needed Rachael Henderson, the Community Development Manager at Canadian Blood Services, said donating during the winter is especially important because blood products are more in demand now than they have been in the last 10 years.\n“There has been an increase in surgeries and treatments that require blood products,” said Henderson. “That also goes back to the fact that the population is aging and growing. So you see the number of units of blood increase that are needed.”\nHenderson adds the donation centre in Waterloo at 94 Bridgeport Rd. E. has several open appointments for those looking to donate.\nCanadian Blood Services have been pushing to have 450 new donors every day this winter to help keep up with demand.\nThe national inventory by blood type as of February 20, 2025 (Screenshot from Canadian Blood Services) Submit a Correction Accessibility Feedback Top Stories Trump’s comments heighten tensions as Canada, U.S. meet in 4 Nations final The charged political atmosphere surrounding the 4 Nations Face-Off final between Canada and the United States escalated further before Thursday's puck drop with another inflammatory social media post...\n6h ago\nMother Nature providing a near-perfect 90th for Chicopee Ski Hill It has been a tough few years for the operators of Chicopee Ski Hill in Kitchener.
