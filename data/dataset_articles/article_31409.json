  "text": "GETTY IMAGES\nShoppers have been told to return affected products to their place of purchase\nTrending on GB News\nA food recall has been issued for several cheeses that may be contaminated with a species of pathogenic bacteria.\nThose who have purchased the affected products have been told not to consume them and instead, return them to their place of purchase.\nThe Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a warning to Britons that JOD Food Products has recalled 18 cheeses.\nSome of the affected products are sold at Spar and Tesco Ireland.\nThe cheeses may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes\nFSA\nThe FSA warned shoppers of \"the possible presence of Listeria monocytogenes in the above products\".\nBritons were told: \"Symptoms caused by this organism can be similar to flu and include high temperature, muscle ache or pain, chills, feeling or being sick and diarrhoea.\n\"However, in rare cases, the infection can be more severe, causing serious complications, such as meningitis.\n\"Some people are more vulnerable to Listeria infections, including those over 65 years of age, pregnant women and their unborn babies, babies less than one-month-old and people with weakened immune systems.\n\"If you have bought the above products do not eat them. Instead, return them to where they were purchased for a full refund.\n\"Any customers with queries or concerns can contact JOD Food Products on 00353 6371209.\"\nFor the official product recall notices, affected customers can visit the FSA. Tesco Ireland has also issued an official product recall notice. This states: \"Old Irish Creamery is recalling a specific date code of its Old Irish Creamery Cheese Cheddar with Whiskey 150g and Old Irish Creamery Cheese Cheddar with Porter 150g [May 15, 2025].\n\"This is due to the possible presence of Listeria monocytogenes that, if consumed, may pose a health risk.\"\nFood recalls should always be taken seriously to ensure customer safety. The FSA explained: \"If there is a problem with a food product that means it should not be sold, then it might be 'withdrawn' (taken off the shelves) or 'recalled' (when customers are asked to return the product).\n\"The FSA issues Product Recall Information Notices to let consumers and local authorities know about problems associated with food.\n\"In some cases, a 'Food Alert for Action' is issued. This provides local authorities with details of specific action to be taken on behalf of consumers.\"\nLATEST DEVELOPMENTS:\n'If you have bought the above products do not eat them'\nFSAFull list of affected cheeses\nSpar Old Irish Creamery Cheddar with Chilli\nPack size: 150g\nUse by: May 25, 2025\nHorgans Irish Smoked Cheddar\nPack size: 150g\nUse by: May 25, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Red Wine\nPack size: 150g and 1.2 kg\nBest before: May 1, 2025 and May 4, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Sriracha\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 15, 2025; May 20, 2025; and May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Pepper Cheese\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Sage Cheddar\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 20, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Caesar Salad\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 20, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Coffee\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 20, 2025\nCladdagh Bo Irish Cheddar Cheese with Irish Whiskey\nPack size: 2.4kg\nBest before: July 18, 2025\nCladdagh Bo Irish Cheddar Cheese with Porter Beer\nPack size: 2.4kg\nBest before: June 29, 2025 and July 17, 2025\nIrish Cheddar with Murphy’s Stout\nPack size: 150g and 1.2kg\nBest before: May 15, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar Oak Smoked\nPack size: 150g and 1.2kg\nBest before: May 15, 2025 and May 25, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Chilli\nPack size: 1.2kg\nBest before: May 15, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Chives\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 4, 2025 and May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Cranberries\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Garlic & Herbs\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 1 2025; May 4, 2025; May 15, 2025; and May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Irish Porter\nPack size: 150g\nBest before: May 20, 2025 and May 29, 2025\nOld Irish Creamery Cheese Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey\nPack size: 150g and 1.2kg\nBest before: May 15, 2025\nThis comes as Britons were warned that crisps that could cause sickness and diarrhoea were pulled from shelves.\nGB News has contacted Tesco for comment",
