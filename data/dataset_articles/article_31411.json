  "text": "This past week the Maine Legislature voted on a supplemental budget which includes funding for MaineCare. This is an essential lifeline for many of our Lincoln County citizens.\nThe measure passed but failed to get the required two-thirds vote to take immediate effect. Without this, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and clinics across Lincoln County will not be paid in the next few months and will be forced to cut essential services or turn patients away.\nAlthough the vote was on party lines, this should not be a partisan issue. We can do better than this in Maine. Of the House representatives whose districts are in, or partly in, Lincoln County, Abden Simmons, Michael Lemelin, and Katrina Smith voted against the supplemental.\nThe issue comes up for another vote on Feb. 25. It should not be too much to ask of our representatives that children and working families do not become the victims of a partisan fight in the legislature.\nNigel Calder\nNewcastle",
