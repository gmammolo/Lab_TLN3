  "text": "LAND O' LAKES, Fla — Changes with Humana TRICARE, the primary healthcare program used by active duty military, have left some local military families fighting for their medical reimbursements.\nA 10 Tampa Bay media affiliate confirmed that on Jan. 1, 2025, Humana Military switched the company it uses for claims processing from WPS Health Insurance to PGBA.\nRetired U.S. Airman Kevin Sellers dutifully tracks his wife's medical expenses. Kim Sellers was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2016 and sees multiple doctors at USF Health and through Tampa General.\nKevin Sellers said he had never faced any issues with her TRICARE health insurance until this past January, when a special test was flagged as \"NOT APPROVED,\" leaving them with a nearly $1,500 unexpected bill and many questions.\n\"When I go through it I can't get a whole lot of information about it, it doesn't tell me why,\" Sellers said. \"I submitted the appeal. It should just show up here to show they have the appeal and that they're working on it, but it still shows up as 'not approved.'\"\nSellers also said he's sent several unanswered emails to TRICARE about the issue.\nFlorida Congressman Gus Bilirakis, a state leader in veteran healthcare, is now looking into the situation on behalf of the Sellers family and others who have brought similar issues to his attention.\nBilirakis tells 10 Tampa Bay that TRICARE is undergoing a \"major system transition\" which has delayed their \"usual\" claims processing time frame. Now, he's filing a formal congressional inquiry with TRICARE.\nFor the Sellers family, this is a matter of transparency.\n\"If they need time, or if they need to get systems up in place, then help us, let us know that,\" Sellers said. \"I don't want to spend my days playing hospital administrator, I'd like to spend my days with my wife.\"\n10 Tampa Bay has reached out directly to TRICARE several times this week for comment about its system transition and issues it has caused for patients. We have not yet heard back.",
