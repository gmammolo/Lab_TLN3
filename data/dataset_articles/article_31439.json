  "text": "HELENA — The Montana House of Representatives on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly against House Bill 371, a measure that would have banned mRNA vaccines — used primarily in COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots — and made it a misdemeanor to administer the shots.\nIntroduced by Greg Kmetz, R-Miles City, the contentious bill revealed deep-held beliefs by some lawmakers about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine technology that became common during the global coronavirus pandemic.\nCurrently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines and boosters from Moderna and Pfizer. The FDA has also approved a Moderna mRNA vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus.",
