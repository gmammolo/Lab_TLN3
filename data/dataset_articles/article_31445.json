  "text": "Recent winter weather extremes are slowing Red Cross blood and platelet donations\nWeather Alert\n...Icy Cold and Slick One More Night... Very cold temperatures in the single digits, even near zero degrees, are forecast tonight. This means any lingering moisture on roadways will refreeze. Other protective cold measures will be needed one more night, like protecting your pipes from freezing. Be especially cautious if traveling, especially over bridges, overpasses, or on secondary roads. Even main highways that look clear might have patches of black ice redevelop. Finally, it's getting alot drier, but lingering snow cover might help induce a little overnight fog. If that occurs, that's another moisture source for freezing and creating slick spots on area roads and walkways...so exercise caution.\n...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in Illinois...Kentucky...Missouri...
