  "text": "EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio — Officials at East Liverpool City Hospital are reporting a significant rise in Influenza A, as well as cases of RSV this season.\nThey say flu cases have increased drastically compared with last year, and RSV cases have risen from zero to five in that span.\n\"We’re seeing a very large uptick, especially in the last 2 weeks,” said Lisa Archer, RN, infection preventionist.\n“We went from last year in February seeing about three influenza to this year seeing about 13 admitted patients with influenza.\"\nArcher warned that people may be spreading these illnesses before they realize they are sick.\n\"Because, unfortunately, with these respiratory illnesses, you can be contagious for 1 to 2 days before you even know you have it,\" she said.\nIn addition to common cold-like symptoms, some flu patients are experiencing stomach issues.\n\"Runny nose, cough, congestion, fever we also been seeing some GI issues with this influenza. It’s kind of well-rounded, just like COVID was,\" Archer said.\nWith emergency rooms filling up, the hospital is encouraging patients with mild symptoms to seek care at clinics instead. Several options are available for those looking for a diagnosis without the long wait times of the ER.\n\"We also have some resident clinics in the hospital on the first floor, same day appointments, Wellsville Clinic same-day appointments,” Archer said. “We also have RVP that you can get same-day appointments. Those are great ways to avoid coming to the emergency room if you’re only looking for a diagnosis.\"\nThe recent influx of patients has put a strain on hospital resources with an unusually high number of admissions in a short period of time.\n\"We went all the way up to 15 influenza admissions in one week, and then we also had one day where we actually had 26 in just one day, which is abnormal for staff,\" Archer said.\nAccording to the CDC, there have been at least 29 million flu cases nationwide this season, leading to 370,00 hospitalizations and 16,00 deaths.\n\"Wash your hands for 20 seconds,” Archer said. “Soap is not the only thing that is important, it is the friction, it is the amount of scrubbing you’re doing. You're scrubbing those germs off your hands.\"\nThe recommendation is to stay home, rest, and hydrate if symptoms are manageable. However, if more severe symptoms develop, like difficulty breathing or chest pain, you should seek medical care immediately.",
