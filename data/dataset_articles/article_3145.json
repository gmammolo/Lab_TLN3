  "text": "India\nSingh will be the first woman to lead this crucial central paramilitary force. Having begun her journey as a Manipur-cadre IPS officer, Singh's story to the top level of the CISF is a testament to her dedication.\nIn a historic moment, Nina Singh, a 1989-batch IPS officer from the Rajasthan cadre, was elevated to the post of Director General of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Singh will be the first woman to lead this crucial central paramilitary force.\nHaving begun her journey as a Manipur-cadre IPS officer, Singh's story to the top level of the CISF is a testament to her dedication.\nOriginally from Bihar, she pursued her education at the Patna Women's College and Jawaharlal Nehru University. She later pursued a Master's degree in Public Administration from Harvard University.\nShe has also co-authored research papers with Nobel laureates Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, according to NDTV.\nHer visionary leadership during her tenure as Joint Director of CBI (2013-2018) saw her overseeing high-profile cases such as the Sheena Bora murder and Jiah Khan suicide.\nIn 2000, she came up with an innovative outreach program as the member secretary for the State Women's Commission, providing a platform for women in distress. Under it, members would go to districts to hold hearings for women in distress.\nHer husband, Rohit Kumar Singh, an Indian Administrative Service officer, currently serves as the Secretary of the Union consumer affairs ministry.\nNina Singh's appointment as the Director General of CISF not only marks a milestone for her but also paves the way for aspiring women in the field of law enforcement. Her spirit serves as an inspiration for the generations to come, which would help break the barriers that are meant to be broken.",
