  "text": "Alaska’s largest health care provider is selling three nursing and assisted-living facilities in Anchorage to a California company, citing rising costs, insufficient reimbursement and a caregiver shortage.\nThe sale by Providence is part of an agreement to sell 10 such facilities to The Ensign Group, according to a statement provided by Mike Canfield, a Providence spokesperson in Alaska. The agreement also includes Oregon, Washington and California.\nFounded in 1999, Ensign is a holding company with subsidiaries that provide services that include skilled nursing, senior living and rehabilitation. It provides care at 327 skilled nursing and senior living facilities, and operates in 15 states, according to its latest annual report.\nEnsign announced the acquisition in December.\nThe facilities being sold in Anchorage are:\n• Providence Extended Care and Providence Transitional Care Center, both near Boniface Parkway in northeast Anchorage.\n• Providence Horizon House in Midtown near Lake Otis Parkway.\nThe change “will ensure continued access to care at a time when nursing homes across the country are struggling to keep up with persistent challenges,” Providence said in the statement.\nProblems include “a national shortage of caregivers, the rising cost of pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment, and reimbursement from payers that has not kept up with inflation,” Providence said.\nThe issues have led to the closure of more than 770 nursing homes across the U.S. since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA spokesperson with Ensign declined a request for an interview this week to discuss details about the sale, citing the company’s “all-encompassing” annual meeting.\nProvidence “conducted an exhaustive search” for Ensign, the statement from Providence said. The companies are “committed to a thoughtful and supportive transition to maintain continuity of care” for both caregivers and patients, Providence said.\n“What sets Ensign apart is that they have not sold a single skilled nursing or assisted living facility in their 25 years of operations,” the statement said.\n“Their commitment to vulnerable populations is reflected in the patients and residents they serve, nearly half of whom are covered by Medicaid,” the statement said.\nThe three centers support 225 residents and 328 employees.\n“As part of our agreement, Ensign will extend job offers to facility-level caregivers in affected ministries when the acquisition is finalized,” the statement from Providence said. “These caregivers will not be asked to re-interview for their jobs.”\nProvidence said the sale in Alaska is expected to be finalized in March, following regulatory review.\nProvidence will continue to operate long-term residential care centers in rural areas such as Seward and Kodiak, and a long-term care nursing and rehabilitation center in Valdez.\nThe sale was previously reported by Alaska’s News Source.",
