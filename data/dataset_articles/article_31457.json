  "text": "‘It’s really challenging’: Egg prices impacting Madison bakery\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - The ongoing nationwide egg shortage because of the bird flu outbreak has led to higher egg prices, leaving grocery stores and consumers scrambled. But for local bakeries, they’re either having to find alternatives or deal with the current cost of eggs.\nAt The Baked Lab in Madison, owner Shawn Bolduc is navigating the current price of eggs as a small business owner.\n“Pretty much every product that we make has some type of egg content in it,” he said.\nAs a from-scratch bakery, Bolduc says it’s been challenging recently.\n“Over the past couple of years, our carton of eggs has gone from $23 ish to this week is was $101,” he said.\nBolduc says The Baked Lab’s biggest seller is wedding cakes. With wedding season starting in just a few months, he says they go through 30 to 45 dozen eggs a week.\n“We use eggs in all of our cake bases. We use egg whites in all of our buttercream. We use our eggs in our brownies, in our cookies, our cookie sandwiches,” he said. “We don’t substitute eggs and it’s really challenging to substitute eggs when you think of baking as a science.”\nBut at Greenbush Bakery in Madison, they’ve never used raw eggs in their baked items.\n“It doesn’t really affect us a whole lot,” owner Taylor Carlson said. “We don’t use raw eggs at all but it’s a dry egg that’s in our donut mixes.”\nCarlson says it’s been a relief for his family’s business because they’ve seen the cost of other essentials go up.\n“A lot of the stuff like sugar and flour it’s all across the board everything went up super high,” Carlson said.\nBut ahead of wedding season for Bolduc, they’re putting all of their eggs in one basket.\n“Hopefully we’ll have some new chickens by the summertime that are healthy enough to provide us some respite from the current prices,” Bolduc said.\nThe Baked Lab says it will continue to monitor egg prices before they raise the cost of products for their customers.\nClick here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app.\nCopyright 2025 WMTV.
