  "text": "You may think you are eating healthy and getting all the essential nutrients you need. But there is a good chance you are still guilty of these unhealthy eating habits that may derail your efforts to eat well. With a little help from UC Davis, we are going to take a look at these bad eating habits that might be quietly wrecking your health. It’s never too late to make a change! Note: The content of this article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional advice. Always consult with a qualified professional for advice tailored to your individual circumstances. Late-night snacking feels so right at the moment, but your body might disagree once you finally hit the pillow. Eating too close to bedtime can seriously mess with your metabolism. It may even spike your blood pressure and even increase your risk of heart disease over time. Not to mention, it’s a sneaky way to pack on extra pounds without even realizing it. Your metabolism slows down at night, which means your body isn’t burning as many calories while you sleep, so those late-night nachos are more likely to be stored as fat rather than used by your body for energy. Eating late at night can also sometimes trigger acid reflux. If you go to bed with a full stomach, you might wake up feeling bloated or even have heartburn, which is not exactly a great way to start the day. Not to mention that your blood sugar and blood pressure can rise from those late-night meals, and over time, this can increase your risk of heart disease. Try setting a “kitchen curfew” where you stop eating 2-3 hours before bed to give your body time to digest. If you really need a late-night snack, keep it light. A small handful of nuts or a piece of fruit won’t weigh you down like a burger and fries. You might think skipping meals saves calories, but doing this can actually backfire big time. When you go too long without eating, your blood sugar drops, making you feel tired, cranky, and foggy-brained. By the time you finally eat, you’re so hungry that you’re way more likely to overeat or make unhealthy choices. When you skip a meal, your metabolism slows down, and your body may go into “starvation mode,” where it holds onto fat instead of burning it. Your energy levels may also crash as no food fuel = no energy. The best thing to do is simply eat something, even if it’s small. A simple banana, a small handful of nuts, or even a Greek yogurt is better than nothing! Try to plan your meals and snacks ahead of time, which can be a lifesaver when life gets busy. Instead of skipping a meal, you’ll be prepared with healthy foods that you enjoy! If your meal disappears in five minutes flat, your body barely has time to realize it’s eating. Your brain needs about 20 minutes to recognize that you’re full, so if you eat too fast, you might end up consuming way more than you actually need. When you eat quickly, you’re more likely to have indigestion and bloating. Swallowing food too quickly can lead to stomach pain, gas, and some serious discomfort. It can even contribute to weight gain, which, as a healthy eater, may not be on your want list. Instead of shoveling tons of food into your mouth as fast as possible, put your fork down between bites, which will force you to slow down. Always chew your food thoroughly and try to aim for at least 15-20 chews per bite (yes, really!). Have a conversation while you eat, which will also help you slow down and enjoy your food even more. Food is better with a company! Have you ever reached for a bag of chips or gone straight for that pint of ice cream after a rough day? You’re not alone. Stress eating is a real thing, and while it might make you feel better in the moment, it doesn’t actually fix anything and can even make you feel worse afterward. Stress triggers cravings for sugary, fatty foods, and those foods temporarily boost your mood. But once the sugar crash hits? You’re back to feeling both stressed and now also guilty. Stress eating also increases your calorie intake without real hunger. Your body isn’t actually hungry, but you are just looking for comfort. So eating when you are stressed doesn’t address the real issue but only distracts you from what’s actually bothering you. So, before you eat, pause and ask yourself: Am I actually hungry or just stressed? Consider going for a walk or listening to music instead of reaching for junk food. But, also try to keep healthy snacks on hand because, if you must munch, eating something healthy and good for you is the best option! Boredom eating is always a tricky one. You’re not eating because you’re hungry; you’re eating because there’s literally nothing else to do. You open the fridge, stare at its contents, and grab something just because it’s there. But, when you eat mindlessly, you’re not even enjoying your food. You’re just filling time. That means you consume extra, unnecessary calories, which, over time, can really add up. Boredom eating also becomes a habit. The more you do it, the more automatic it becomes. Instead of always reaching for the snacks when you are bored, find a distraction instead. Call a friend, go for a walk, or do something creative instead of reaching for food. You should also always start by drinking a glass of water as sometimes, thirst is mistaken for hunger. Bad eating habits can be tricky to catch, but once you are aware of these little eating mistakes, you can start making better choices. Start following these tips today, and your body will thank you later! This article was inspired by UC Davis and was first published at Spatula Desserts .
