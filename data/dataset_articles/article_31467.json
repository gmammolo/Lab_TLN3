  "text": "JEFFERSON COUNTY, Ohio — Jefferson County commissioners are taking steps to address the persistent flooding at the prosecutor's office in the Jefferson County Justice Center.\nThe commissioners have agreed to seek proposals to relocate the office.\n\"With the long-range plan, once we get them moved out, we get in, get the right people, contractors. Let's really dig in to see if we can have a resolution to fix the issues they have, and then long-term, have that area where we could make it available to either other governmental entities or who knows,\" Commissioner Tony Morelli said.\nMorelli emphasized that the office cannot be used in its current state due to the intermittent flooding.",
