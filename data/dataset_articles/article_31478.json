  "text": "Human Interest Real People Real People Tragedy 2-Year-Old Reportedly Dies After Waiting Hours for Hospital Bed: 'We Were Ignored,' Mom Claims “He had his whole life ahead of him,” Joe Massa's family said in a statement By David Chiu David Chiu David Chiu is a staff writer, Human Interest, for PEOPLE. A former PEOPLE intern from 2007 to 2008, he has been writing about news and entertainment for over 10 years. People Editorial Guidelines Published on February 20, 2025 06:09PM EST 1 Comments Joe Massa, 2, was taken to Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney after falling ill last SeptemberHis parents alleged that after being admitted to the hospital, their son waited for over two hours for a bed — then had a heart attack later that night and was taken off life support days later\"We were ignored,\" mom Elouise Massa told ABC Radio Sydney The parents of a 2-year-old boy who died while seeking treatment at a hospital in Australia are speaking out, accusing the facility of failing their son “at every level.” \"He died a cruel death at the hands of a hospital that failed him,\" mom Elouise Massa said of her late son Joe in an interview with 9News. On Sept. 14, 2024, a weakened Joe was taken to Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney after having vomited throughout the night, Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC News) reported. The family said that Joe was suffering from major hypovolemia, a condition in which the body loses fluid, which is crucial to maintaining organ function, according to The Guardian. Mom Claims Her 11-Day-Old Daughter Died from Infection at ‘Absolutely Putrid’ Hospital: Reports At the time of Joe’s admission, a triage nurse and an emergency trainee doctor allegedly classified him as a Category 3 patient, a designation that means he required treatment within 30 minutes, 7News, Sky News and ABC News reported. (A subsequent review challenged whether this was the right classification given the severity of his illness, findings which the hospital said they accepted in a statement obtained by PEOPLE.) However, according to the family, after being admitted to the hospital, Joe was not given a bed for over two hours. “I don’t have any medical training, but I do know my son and I did know that he was deteriorating. He was not getting any better,\" mom Elouise told the outlet. \"He was getting worse by the minute.\" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \"We were ignored,\" Elouise told ABC Radio Sydney. \"As soon as we stepped foot into that hospital, Joe had no chance of survival.\" More than three hours after he was admitted to the hospital, Joe suffered a heart attack, according to the outlets. His was taken off life support two days later due to the brain damage he sustained, reported ABC News. “He had his whole life ahead of him,” the family said in a statement shared with the Guardian, “and we trusted Northern Beaches hospital to provide the care he needed. Instead, he was failed at every level.” Doctor Watched Son, 22, Die of Sepsis at Hospital Where She Worked After Her Advice Was 'Ignored': Reports In a statement obtained by PEOPLE, New South Wales Minister for Health Ryan Park confirmed that a Serious Adverse Event Review (SAER) report had \"been undertaken\" and that the hospital \"accepted all recommendations.” The report, which was submitted to the New South Wales Ministry of Health on Dec. 20, pointed out a number of missteps in the case, according to Sky News, news.com.au and the New York Post. In a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, a spokesperson from Healthscope, which oversees Northern Beaches Hospital, said that the hospital \"accepts the findings\" of the review, \"including that there was an under appreciation of the severity of Joe’s illness and a delay in recognising deterioration.\" \"The doctors and nurses in our emergency department are exceptionally dedicated, and devoted to providing high quality care. They are devastated at Joe’s death, and committed to implementing all recommendations to prevent an incident like this from happening again,\" they added, noting that the hospital will continue to \"cooperate in full with any further review or investigations into this tragic incident.” In his statement, Park called what happened a \"terrible tragedy.\" “In the last 24 hours I have discussed with the Secretary of NSW Health to understand actions being taken in response to this tragedy,\" Park added. \"I have made it clear to NSW Health all recommendations need to be implemented in full and as quickly as possible.\" Continuing, Park added, “As the Minister for Health, this is among the worst possible things that can happen in our health system – a young child who should be with us is no longer alive. I never want any parent to go through this.\" Close",
