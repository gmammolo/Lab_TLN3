  "text": "Amazon miniTV, Amazon’s free video streaming service, recently released the second installment of its crime thriller anthology series - Crimes Aaj Kal . Produced by Optimystix Entertainment and directed by Subbu Iyer, the series focuses on showcasing the shocking incidents of crime that involve the youth of India, either as perpetrators or as victims. Hosted by versatile actor Pratik Gandhi, the show warns viewers about the crimes happening in their very own neighbourhood and sheds light on how they can safeguard themselves against them.\nAs Crimes Aaj Kal 2 marks Pratik Gandhi ’s debut as a host, the actor candidly spoke about his experience donning the host’s hat for the show. He said, “ Crimes Aaj Kal season 2 marked my first on-screen anchoring experience. I have hosted poetry shows and engaged in stage anchoring before, but I have never hosted a show like this on screen. It posed a new challenge for me. It required significant effort to prepare for a role that I had never undertaken. Initially, narrating the plot and presenting different criminal stories was tough. But, as actors, it is our job to embrace new roles. So, I approached it without overthinking and gave it my best shot as I love to explore challenging opportunities.”\nCrimes Aaj Kal S2 is streaming now for free on Amazon miniTV, available on Amazon’s shopping app, Fire TV, and Play Store.",
