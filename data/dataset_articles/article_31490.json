  "text": "The first game of spring training proved rather consequential for Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller. The reasons for his concerns had little to do with the game itself, however. Miller took a shot to the head while attempting to field a blazing liner from Cubs first baseman Michael Busch. The 25-year old, who endured an injury-plagued 2024 campaign, exited the game under his own power. But he was worse for the wear, drifting into the dugout with a bulging battle scar as a result. Here's what you need to know. Miller crumpled to the mound after taking a line drive to the head from Busch. The incident occurred in the third inning when Busch scorched a Miller breaking ball right back where it came from. Miller attempted to put his glove up to protect his face. But the 105.5 mph missile proved too hot to handle. Miller rubbed on his head for a brief period before exiting the contest to a roaring applause. He waked off on his own accord, leaving the game with what looked to be a large welt developing on his right temple. Busch took to first base on the play, while Vidal Brujan, the man on second, crossed home plate to tack on another run to Chicago's lead.",
