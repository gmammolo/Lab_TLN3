  "text": "The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) issues the following statement in response to new reporting of the recently published study, “Muscle-building supplement use is associated with muscle dysmorphia symptomatology among Canadian adolescents and young adults” in PLOS Mental Health:\nThe Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) believes in sound science and rigorous research when it comes to dietary supplements. But when studies are misrepresented to push an agenda, that’s when we need to set the record straight.\nCorrelation is not causation. It’s a basic rule of science, yet it’s being ignored in the rush to blame muscle-building supplements for body image issues. A recent study on supplement use and muscle dysmorphia among Canadian adolescents and young adults has been twisted to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship that simply doesn’t exist.\nNo Evidence That Supplements Cause Muscle Dysmorphia\nThe study itself makes it clear: \"The data were cross-sectional, and thus the findings should not be interpreted as causal.\" In other words, it does not offer evidence that muscle-building supplements lead to body image disorders—only that people who are already focused on improving their physique tend to use them. In fact, the study continues, “Similarly, there may be bidirectional relationships between muscle-building supplement use and muscle dysmorphia symptomology.” The authors suggest that the causality may go the other direction.\nYet, misleading headlines are already out there claiming that “muscle-building supplements may put teens at risk” for a body image disorder. That’s not what the study proves, and it’s irresponsible to suggest otherwise. This kind of alarmist reporting only confuses consumers and misleads policymakers into thinking safe, legal supplements are a problem when they aren’t.\nThe Common-Sense Explanation: People Want to Improve Their Health\nIf we step back and apply some simple logic, the most obvious explanation is that people who are dissatisfied with their appearance take steps to change it. That might mean adjusting their diet, exercising more, or taking supplements to support their goals. In fact, the study itself found that supplement users were actually more satisfied with their progress than non-users. That doesn’t sound like a problem—it sounds like a solution.\nConflating Legal Supplements with Harmful Substances\nIt’s also worth noting that previous research (including work by one of this study’s authors) has often lumped legal dietary supplements in with anabolic steroids and banned substances. This study tries to correct that by focusing on everyday products like whey protein, creatine, and amino acids. But it still mixes in food products like protein bars, which don’t even fall under the same regulatory category as dietary supplements. If we’re going to have an honest conversation, we need to be precise about what we’re actually studying.\nAcknowledging the Benefits of Supplements\nUnlike some past studies that try to cast doubt on whether muscle-building supplements work, this one actually recognizes their benefits, citing research on creatine’s positive effects on muscle growth and performance. That’s well-established science. Yet, instead of focusing on those benefits, the study’s conclusions take a sharp turn into speculation about risks that aren’t supported by the data.\nThe Bottom Line: Let’s Stick to the Facts\nCRN supports legitimate scientific research, responsible regulation, and honest discussions about supplement use. But misleading interpretations and fearmongering don’t serve anyone—least of all the consumers who rely on these products as part of a balanced approach to health and fitness. Instead of distorting science to push an agenda, let’s focus on the facts and ensure that dietary supplements are understood for what they really are: safe, effective tools that help people reach their goals.",
