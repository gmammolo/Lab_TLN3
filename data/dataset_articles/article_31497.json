  "text": "HOUSTON, Texas — Defense attorney Wes Rucker called sleepwalking the elephant in the room in the trial of now 21-year-old Benjamin Elliott.\n\"Is this just some made-up bologna or a really creative defense?\" Rucker said. \"The answer is absolutely not.\"\nHe shared data with the jury after the state rested its case that \"parasomnia,\" which includes sleepwalking, can occur shortly after falling asleep. He added that, like in this case, it can result in sudden, violent events where there's a lack of motive and no attempt to cover it up.\n\"And this is not a rouse, this is not some defense to get Ben off a tragic, tragic set of circumstances,\" Rucker said.\nHe said the jury would eventually have to decide if Benjamin Elliott is a psychopath or suffered parasomnia when his twin sister, Meghan Elliott, was fatally stabbed in her bed in September 2021.\nAmong Thursday's witnesses was a forensic psychologist who examined Benjamin Elliott leading up to the trial.\n\"At the time of my interview, he was reporting some current mental health issues but he reported no mental health issues that were evident at the time of the alleged incident,\" Dr. Wendy Elliott, who is not related to the defendant's family, said.\nBenjamin Elliott's older sister, who testified via Zoom from Georgia, recalled an episode from years ago involving Benjamin Elliott possibly sleepwalking before appearing in a bedroom doorway unresponsive to her and his twin calling his name.\n\"And I just like touched his shoulder and his eyes were barely open and then we told him to go back to bed,\" Elizabeth Elliott said.\nA great-aunt also testified about a family history of sleepwalking.\nMeanwhile, prosecutors believe Benjamin Elliott was awake when his twin sister died based on, among other things, activity on his cell phone just minutes beforehand.",
