  "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. — A boy who was found unconscious and unresponsive in a bathtub in Glendale Thursday afternoon is on the road to recovery, according to officials with the Glendale Police Department.\nVERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL: Niño encontrado inconsciente dentro de una bañera en Glendale\nOfficers responded to 911 calls at a home near 59th Avenue and Bethany Home Road around 2 p.m. and found the child unresponsive. The child was rushed to a hospital in critical condition, officials said.\nAs of Friday morning, the boy has been recovering well and is in stable condition, a detective on the case said.\nThe mother told officers she stepped away and found the child in the bathtub before calling 911.\nThis is a developing story. 12News will post updates here.\nRELATED: Phoenix Children's Hospital expert shares tips on how to keep children safe around water\nDrowning Prevention Tips Drowning is the leading cause of death for children between ages 1-4 aside from birth defects, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Three children die every day as a result of drowning. Here are some tips from the CDC on how to protect children around water:\nLearn life-saving skills.\nEveryone should know the basics of swimming (floating, moving through the water) and CPR.\nFence it off.\nInstall a four–sided isolation fence, with self–closing and self–latching gates, around backyard swimming pools. This can help keep children away from the area when they aren’t supposed to be swimming. Pool fences should be completely separate the house and play area from the pool.\nLife jackets are a must.\nMake sure kids wear life jackets in and around natural bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean, even if they know how to swim. Life jackets can be used in and around pools for weaker swimmers too.\nKeep a close watch\nWhen kids are in or near water (including bathtubs), closely supervise them at all times. Because drowning happens quickly and quietly, adults watching kids in or near water should avoid distracting activities like reading books, talking on the phone, or using alcohol and drugs.\nClose Ad",
