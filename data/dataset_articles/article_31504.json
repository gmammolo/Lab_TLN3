  "text": "The Ministry of Health needs to overhaul its procurement of medicine and medical supplies for public hospitals. The number of medications and chemicals in short supply is alarming and poses a risk to the public.\nIt is worrying that there is a temporary disruption in biochemistry testing across various medical wards and clinics within the main hospitals and district hospitals in Upolu and Savai'i.\nThe restriction, highlighted in a Memorandum dated 18 February 2025, limits routine biochemistry tests to only the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Emergency Department (ED) due to a critical shortage of necessary reagents.\nThis means that important tests to successfully diagnose ailments are not at the disposal of the hard-working medical staff. In addition to the biochemistry reagent shortage, a list of available medicine supplies reveals that other critical medications are currently out of stock across the nation’s health facilities.\nThe shortage of these reagents vital for conducting biochemical tests is causing significant challenges for clinicians.\nAs of 17 February 2025, 14 oral tablets and capsules are completely unavailable, and some of these items have been flagged as \"long-term out of stock.\" Among the most concerning shortages are medicines such as ibuprofen (400mg), with only the 200mg formulation available. The next expected delivery for these supplies is 5 March 2025.\nFor injectable medications, 37 are out of stock, including adrenaline 1MG/ML, which is crucial for life-saving resuscitation efforts. Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 1.2g for injection, another essential medication, is also unavailable.\nAdditionally, six oral liquid formulations are out of stock, and seven topical products are unavailable.\nAnother pressing concern is the shortage of ipratropium bromide 20 mcg inhalers, which are used for managing chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema. Didn’t the MOH declare a whooping cough outbreak? Children are still presenting themselves to the hospital with the symptoms.\nAdditionally, 13 eye, ear, and nose products are reported to be out of stock, further exacerbating the strain on the nation’s healthcare system. The medications and chemicals are essential for effectively diagnosing cases and not having them in stock is a worry.\nA larger number of people cannot access private doctors because of affordability. That is the reason why many will wait endlessly at the hospital to see doctors and attain their subsidised medication. The government, in this case, the MOH must ensure that medications are always available and hospitals can carry out tests whenever needed.\nThis situation in no way shows improvements in the public health system. Improving health services is part of every election promise, this shows how much effort has been used to fulfilling that promise.\nHospital and pharmacy inventory management is a complex but critical process within the healthcare delivery system. Without adequate pharmacy inventory management practices, hospitals run the risk of not being able to provide patients with the most appropriate medication when it is most needed.\nThat is what we are witnessing unfold. It could not be anyone’s fault just a need to review the processes and adapt one that will always ensure that there is medications and chemicals needed for labs are always in stock.\nThere are many reasons why hospitals are not always able to get certain medicines. This may include when manufacturers can have problems with making the medicine, transporting the medicines or there are problems with sourcing the ingredients needed to make the medicines. The current situation we are facing has been blamed on delayed shipment. That is why an effective inventory or procurement system is needed.\nThe shortage of medicine in hospitals and failure to conduct necessary tests could become the difference between life and death. The people need better healthcare. Plan wisely and stock medicines and chemicals better.\nSurely, there are enough funds to procure enough supplies. There should be no reason why so many medications are unavailable. If doctor and nurse shortages cannot be fixed instantly, the least that can be done is to have enough medicines.",
