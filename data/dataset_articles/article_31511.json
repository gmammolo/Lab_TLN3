  "text": "Written by: A. Smith\nPublished February 20, 2025 @ 5:02 PM ET\nCOWETA COUNTY, Ga. – A Coweta County mother has been arrested after her 2-year-old child overdosed on THC edibles, according to authorities.\nOn January 15, 2025, deputies with the Coweta County Sheriff’s Office responded to a home on the 400 block of Deep South Road around 11:06 a.m. after being requested to assist EMS with a reported overdose.\nThe child was found experiencing symptoms including wooziness, difficulty walking and drowsiness after consuming an unknown amount of THC gummies. First responders transported the toddler to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta in emergency status.\nThe child’s mother, Kimberly Turner , told deputies that she regularly consumes THC edibles and vapes. She said she took one edible that morning with her coffee but may have left an open container of “SUMO THC Edibles” on the kitchen counter. The product, labeled as containing 420 milligrams of THC per gummy, was reportedly within the child’s reach.\nTurner stated that she left the child unattended for an extended period while she went to the restroom. When she returned, she found the toddler actively eating the edibles. She estimated that the child consumed approximately 10 gummies around 11 a.m. Turner told her mother-in-law, who immediately called 911.\nDuring the investigation, deputies found several THC gummies on the floor near a gun safe where Turner claimed she typically stored them. Officers also found three THC vape pens in plain view on top of the safe, which stood about 4 1/2 feet tall. A field test confirmed the presence of THC in the vapes. Turner provided deputies with the remaining THC edibles, with only nine left from the original 25-count bottle. The product’s packaging noted: “Extremely potent. Go easy- adult use 21+ only, WARNING: keep out of reach of children.”\nWhen questioned, Turner admitted to understanding the dangers of THC exposure for young children and acknowledged that her actions were negligent. She initially denied taking an edible that morning but later admitted to consuming one after deputies observed signs of THC impairment, including bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils and slowed cognitive function.\nTurner was arrested and booked into the Coweta County Jail. The child’s grandmother accompanied the toddler to the hospital. The child’s father, who returned home from work after being notified of the incident, told deputies that Turner’s THC “addiction” had caused ongoing issues in their marriage. He stated that he did not purchase the THC products for her and was unaware of her online purchases from California.\nThe Georgia Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) has been notified and is investigating the incident. The child’s current condition remains unknown.\nThe Coweta County Sheriff’s Office has not released additional details as the investigation is ongoing.\nOfficer’s Narrative:\n[Please note: The following is a direct transcription from the official initial incident report. The Georgia Gazette does not fix any spelling or grammatical errors that may exist. Any changes or redactions made by our staff are placed inside brackets. Some errors may exist. All subjects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. The topics discussed may be sensitive to some readers. Discretion is advised.]\nOn the day of January 15, 2025 at approximately 1106 hours I, DS C. Wilson, was requested to assist Coweta County EMS in regards to an overdose involving a 2 year old child at [400 BLOCK] Deep South Road In Coweta County. Upon arrival I was advised that EMS would be transporting the child, [REDACTED BY AGENCY] to CHOA “Childrens Hospital” in Atlanta in an emergency status due to the child having consumed an unknown amount of THC edibles and had already been actively experiencing Symptoms such as Wooziness, unsteady on feet, and sleepy like symptoms.\nI spoke with the mother (suspect), Kimberly Turner, who invited me into the residence. Turner advised me that she takes THC Edibles and vapes, she woke up this morning around 7 AM where she went to the kitchen, took her “SUMO THC EDIBLES” which are labeled as 420mg per gummy, THC-A/THC-P/Delta-9, which she orders online, she said she took 1 of them with her coffee. She said that she believes she left the 2/3’s full (25 Count) open bottle of edibles on the kitchen counter within reach of her 2 year old child, before then leaving the kitchen entirely while simultaneously leaving the child unattended for a lengthy period of time due to Turner stating that she had an upset stomach and needed to go to the rest room. Turner stated that upon getting out of the rest room she went into the living room where she found [REDACTED BY AGENCY] actively eating the THC edibles. She stated she believed he ate roughly 10 of them at approximately 1100 hours. She told her mother, [WITNESS #1], what had happened and [WITNESS #1] immediately called 911.\nI asked Turner to show me where she typically kept the THC edibles and she told me in the gun safe, and pointed to the safe that was in the dining room area. I observed on the ground near the safe several THC edible gummies just laying in the open. As well as 3 THC vape pens in plain view on top of the gun safe that was approximately 4 and a half feet tall. I took those items and secured them for evidence purpose. A rapid detect test kit used on the THC vapes, and they did indicate a positive result for THC and no result whatsoever for CBD. Turner also provided me with the bottle which contains the majority of THC edibles and there were a total of 9 of them remaining from the original 25. The bottle of THC edibles clearly states in plain writing “Extremely potent. Go easy- adult use 21+ only, WARNING: keep out of reach of children”.\nI asked Turner if she understood the substantial dangers present if a 2 year old child were to take the THC edibles and she told me yes. I asked her if she believed her actions were negligent and she told me yes. Initially turner had told me she had not taken any of the edibles herself, however after making observations of her physical appearance (Bloodshot glassed eyes, extremely dilated pupils) to include her having a slowed thought process and struggling to recollect events that had taken place this same morning. I told her I knew she had taken THC to some extent and that was when she admitted to having taken them early this morning after waking up. Turner was placed under arrest and [WITNESS #1] was transported with the 2 year old child to CHOA children’s hospital. I read Turner her Miranda Rights and she told me she understood them.\nI spoke with [WITNESS #1] and asked for her side of the events. She said that she was inside her residence when she was notified by her daughter in Law Kimberly Turner that [REDACTED BY AGENCY] had eaten THC edibles. [WITNESS #1] immediately called 911 and requested EMS to be in route. That was [WITNESS #1]’s involvement of the incident. [WITNESS #1] was released from the scene and she was transported along side [REDACTED BY AGENCY] to CHOA.\nI made contact with Turner’s husband [WITNESS #2], [REDACTED BY AGENCY] father, and requested he return from work in Peachtree City Georgia, to his residence so I could speak with him. [WITNESS #2] arrived approximately 20 minutes later and I advised him of the incident that had took place. He immediately became infuriated and went on a spill about Kimberly’s THC addiction and the issues it has caused in their marriage ranging from Infidelity on Turner’s behalf, as well as poor judgement by her. He told me that he does not buy the THC products for her and that she orders them online from California with funds that he has not been made aware of. During my conversation with [WITNESS #2] he appeared to have a sound mind, and did not appear to be under the influence of any form of substance.\nUltimately Turner was transported to the Coweta County Jail where she was booked. The current condition of the child is unknown.\nDFCS was contacted and I spoke with Operator [REDACTED] and informed her of the details of the incident.\n[End of Narrative]",
