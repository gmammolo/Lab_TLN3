  "text": "Chicago Bulls forward Patrick Williams will not play for the next two weeks after receiving a platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection in his right knee, the team announced Thursday.\nWilliams suffered a knee-to-knee collision with a Detroit Pistons player on Feb. 12 in the final game before the All-Star break. After taking the break to recover, Williams participated fully in practice Tuesday and Wednesday. But he experienced discomfort after Wednesday’s practice, leading to the decision to undergo injection treatment.\nA PRP injection in a knee is a fairly standard procedure for NBA players that aims to enhance healing and reduce inflammation. The Bulls medical team will reevaluate Williams in two weeks, although he is not guaranteed to return at that time. The timeline means Williams will miss at least eight of the Bulls’ final 27 regular-season games.\nInjuries have nagged the 23-year-old Williams throughout his five NBA seasons. He played only 17 games in his second season after undergoing wrist surgery, and he missed almost half of last season with a left foot injury that ultimately required surgery. Williams already missed 10 games this season because of lingering discomfort in that foot.\nWilliams is averaging 9.1 points and four rebounds this season. He showed some improvement when moved out of the starting lineup at the end of January, averaging 9.2 points and 4.8 rebounds over nine games despite playing two fewer minutes per game.\nThe Bulls now enter the final stretch of the season at a steep size disadvantage. Small ball already had become the status quo for the Bulls, who have relied on speed and high-volume 3-point shooting to try to offset their smaller rotations.\nWithout Williams, the Bulls will rely on their three youngest players to fill in at power forward: rookie Matas Buzelis, 20; second-year pro Julian Phillips, 21; and third-year pro Dalen Terry, 22. Buzelis already had stepped into Williams’ starting role for the last four games before the All-Star break, a position he likely will fill for the remainder of the season.",
