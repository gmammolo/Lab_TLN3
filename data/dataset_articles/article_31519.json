  "text": "Related videos:\nThe young Cuban Dayan Sotolongo, who suffers from elephantiasis in both legs, still cannot travel to Spain for surgery after a year of processing paperwork and seeking help online.\nDayan spoke live on Facebook with the activist identified as Pesca in Miami, and reported that during this time the government (the Ministry of Public Health) has denied him the document that explains that there is no cure for him in the country, which is necessary to process a humanitarian visa.\nThe 20-year-old from Pinar del Río, who can barely walk due to his illness, lives in rented accommodation in Havana and survives thanks to the support of people who provide him with food and money.\nAccording to what he said, in October he was contacted by a doctor from Spain who was willing to operate on him.\nThanks to the solidarity of many people, he gradually managed to gather the money to cover the fare and entrance to Spain. The treatment is expected to last about two years, as he suffers from fourth-degree lymphedema in both limbs, a very serious condition.\nUnfortunately, during the natural phenomenon of the DANA that occurred in December in Valencia, the doctor’s husband and son passed away, and she is still receiving therapy.\n\"That's why I haven't been able to leave yet. I'm waiting, I'm here in Havana struggling a lot, but thank God I haven't been lacking anything,\" he stated.\nIn May of last year, the comedian Andy Vázquez held a live stream to raise money.\n\"The only thing he needs to leave for Spain is the money for the ticket. As you can see from his legs, he has to travel in first class because he doesn’t fit in a regular seat. The first-class ticket costs 1,700 dollars (on average) and his sister's ticket is 800. That would total 2,500 dollars,\" Andy explained.\nFrequently Asked Questions about the Case of Dayan Sotolongo and the Medical Situation in Cuba\nWhy hasn't Dayan Sotolongo been able to travel to Spain for his treatment?\nDayan Sotolongo has been unable to travel to Spain because the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba has refused to provide him with the necessary document that certifies there are no means to treat his illness in Cuba. This document is crucial for applying for a humanitarian visa. Moreover, although he has raised part of the money for his trip and treatment, he continues to face bureaucratic obstacles and lacks the total amount needed for first-class tickets, which are required due to his physical condition.\nWhat is elephantiasis and how does it affect Dayan Sotolongo?\nElephantiasis is a condition characterized by severe lymphedema that causes an increase in the size of the limbs due to fluid accumulation. Dayan suffers from stage four lymphedema in both legs, which prevents him from walking properly and causes significant pain. His case is complex and requires specialized treatment that is not available in Cuba.\nHow has the Cuban healthcare system handled the case of Dayan Sotolongo?\nThe Cuban healthcare system has been ineffective in treating Dayan, even denying him a temporary solution or a clear diagnosis. Despite his serious condition, the Ministry of Public Health has not provided him with the necessary documents to seek treatment abroad. In his testimony, Dayan has expressed that, although he has received visits from officials and doctors, he has not obtained the promised help or the necessary resources for his illness.\nWhat support has Dayan Sotolongo received from the community and activists?\nDayan has received financial and moral support from sympathetic individuals, activists, and public figures, such as comedian Andy Vázquez, who organized a fundraising campaign to help cover some of his travel expenses. He has also been aided by a doctor in Spain willing to perform the surgery, although she has been unable to proceed due to a personal tragedy. The Cuban community has demonstrated solidarity in response to the inaction of the Cuban government.\nWhat other similar cases of medical difficulties exist in Cuba?\nThe case of Dayan is not unique. Other cases, such as that of Damir Ortiz Ramírez, a child who requires treatment in the United States for a serious eye disease, demonstrate a pattern of bureaucratic obstacles from the Cuban Ministry of Public Health. These situations reflect a healthcare system that often fails to provide adequate medical care and allows patients to seek treatment options abroad.\nFiled under:",
