  "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio — The cause of death was revealed for former Ohio State offensive lineman Ben Christman.\nAccording to his obituary, Christman died in his sleep from natural causes. He was found dead in an apartment near UNLV on Feb. 11, a day before his 22nd birthday.\nChristman began his college career at Ohio State as a highly ranked prospect in the 2021 recruiting class. He redshirted that season and played in one game in 2022 before transferring to Kentucky. Christman did not play in 2023 because of a knee injury but appeared in all 12 games last season on special teams.\nHe then transferred to UNLV after the 2024-25 season.\nIn a statement, UNLV head coach Dan Mullen said the team was \"heartbroken.\"\n\"Since the day Ben set foot on our campus a month ago, he made the Rebels a better program,\" Mullen said. \"Ben was an easy choice for our Leadership Committee as he had earned the immediate respect, admiration and friendship of all his teammates.\"\n“There is little that can be said to lessen the pain of suddenly losing a member of our university family at such a young age, and my heart breaks for all who knew and loved him,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a statement.\n\"Those who knew Ben will remember him for his joyful spirit, kind heart and unshakeable commitment to those around him. He leaves behind a family who adored him, friends and teammates who admired him, and a community who will forever cherish the impact he made during his brief time with us,\" the obituary read in part.\nFamily members will hold a memorial service for Christman at St. Sebastian Catholic Church in Akron Friday morning.",
