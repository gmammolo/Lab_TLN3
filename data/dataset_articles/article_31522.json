  "text": "First Alert Safety Check: Test for the flu at home\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Multiple sources have called this flu season the worst in decades. Data from the CDC shows that at least 24 million people in the U.S. have caught the flu so far this season, and that number continues to climb. For the first time, you can test yourself and your family at home for both COVID-19 and the flu.\nPediatric infectious disease specialist at Sanford Health, Ashley Sands, MD, said, “They’re very similar to the at-home COVID test that we took, that were mailed to us. So, it tests for a little bit of the virus to see if you have been infected.”\nAll you do is swab your nose for about 10 seconds in each nostril and wait 15 to 30 minutes for the test to develop. However, these over-the-counter tests come with their own limitations.\n“You can have false negatives if you test yourself too early, so you may need to test two or three times before you get that positive test,” said Sands.\nThese tests can be found at your local pharmacy or on Amazon. A positive test can help determine whether you’ve contracted COVID-19 or the flu, ultimately getting you treatment faster.\n“Because we do have some oral treatments that you can do at home to try and decrease your symptoms and make your symptoms not so bad,” Sands explained.\nHealth officials said there’s still time to get your flu vaccine and encourage you to implement healthy habits into your life to prevent contracting or spreading the virus.\n“Washing your hands. If you’re not feeling well stay home. we can wear makes out in public if we have to go out in public and just take care of ourselves and get lots of rest and keep yourself hydrated with fluids and get a nice well-balanced diet,” said Sands.\nIf you are experiencing concerning symptoms, such as high fevers that haven’t broken for multiple days, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing, health officials urge you to seek medical attention.\nCopyright 2025 Dakota News Now.
