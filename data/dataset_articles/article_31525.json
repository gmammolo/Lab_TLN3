  "text": "PREMIUM News Euroa bird flu outbreak widens By Kate Walters Feb 21, 2025 Victorian chief veterinary officer Graeme Cooke says the threat of bird flu is not over. Photo by Ray Sizer A bird flu outbreak at Euroa has spread, with avian influenza detected at a third poultry farm in the area.\nHold tight - we’re checking permissions before loading more content\nOn Thursday, February 20, Agriculture Victoria confirmed the virus had been detected at a property in close proximity to the other infected sites.\nAccording to Victorian Acting Chief Veterinary Officer Cameron Bell, the finding is not unexpected given how close the properties are.\nAgriculture Victoria staff are on the ground, working to contain and eradicate the virus.\nKinross Farms has confirmed on its website that it is impacted by the outbreak.\n“The management team at the Euroa site is working with Agriculture Victoria and other relevant authorities to manage the situation, placing a priority on the health and wellbeing of our people, and the welfare of our chickens,” the statement on the website said.\nRestrictions have been in place since bird flu was first detected on a farm in Euroa earlier this month.\nThe control orders restrict the movement of poultry, poultry products, equipment and vehicles on or off properties in designated zones to prevent the spread of disease.\nThe zones cover a restricted 5km radius around the infected farms, and a broader control area spanning east of the Goulburn Valley Fwy and including the townships of Euroa, Violet Town, Longwood, Ruffy, Avenel and Strathbogie.\n“If you are in the control or restricted areas, you cannot move birds, products (including eggs and manure) or equipment into, out of or within the area without permit,” Dr Bell said.\n“This includes selling or giving away eggs from your poultry — these must not leave your property.”\nOther restrictions introduced after confirmation of infection at the second Euroa property also remain in place.\nA housing requirement for properties with 50 or more poultry in Euroa, or within 5km of affected farms, continues.\nBirds on these properties must be kept in cages or sheds to avoid contact with other birds and reduce the risk of further disease spread.\nThe H7N8 avian flu detected in this outbreak is different from the strain that wreaked havoc last year and saw 1.8 million birds killed in southern Victoria, NSW and the ACT.\nIt also differs from the H5N1 bird flu spreading in other areas of the world.\nDr Bell said supermarket eggs and poultry products remained safe for Victorians to consume.\nStill, he urged poultry and bird owners to remain vigilant in trying to prevent the spread of disease.\n“A strong biosecurity system relies on everyone playing their part,” he said.\n“Immediate notification from poultry owners when they notice their poultry are unwell is crucial to us getting on top of this outbreak.”\nCommunity members must report suspected disease and sudden poultry death by calling the VicEmergency Hotline on 1800 226 226 .\nFor more information, including to check whether you are in the restricted area or control area, visit agriculture.vic.gov.au/avianinfluenza\nNews Bird flu outbreak at Euroa chicken farm News Avian influenza detected at second Euroa poultry farm Podcasts Digging Deeper | Breaking down the bird flu - What is it about?
