  "text": "Kochi: Nearly five months since the launch of Thrikkakara Consumer Protection Forum app, aimed at helping consumers report food quality issues in eateries under the local body, the initiative failed to deliver results.\nDesigned by a Thrissur-based IT firm, the app was launched by minister for food and civil supplies GR Anil in Sept last year, promising to ensure access to quality food products within the municipality's jurisdiction. The initiative was introduced following a rise in stale food sales and the death of a 24-year-old man due to food poisoning in Oct last year.\nMunicipality initially assured that the app's administration panel would include officials from municipality, food safety department, legal metrology department and a representative from police department.\nDespite its promising launch, municipality officials revealed that the app remains non-functional, with no complaints received to date. Municipality chairperson Radhamani Pillai admitted its failure, stating, \"The app has not yielded the intended results; we will analyze what went wrong in its operation.\" Municipality health standing committee chairperson Varghese Plassery confirmed that health wing did not receive any complaints through the app.\nStay updated with breaking news , bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
