  "text": "Kochi: Most Keralites have a pesticide phobia, but that has not stopped farmers and cultivators in the state from using them. The highest pesticide use in the state in 2023-24 was for the paddy crop, followed by banana and spices, said a report in the Economic Review 2024.\nAccording to the report, the total use of pesticides reported in 2023-24 was the highest in the last three years at 511.4 metric tonnes (MT). This included 236.2 MT of chemical pesticides and 275.2 MT of bio-pesticides.\nCompared to the previous year, the total consumption of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilisers decreased in 2023-24, to 69,794 MT, 32,740 MT and 57,263 MT respectively. The per hectare (ha) consumption of NPK fertilisers decreased in 2023-24 compared to the previous year, with 26kg per ha, 12kg per ha and 20kg per ha respectively. The ratio of consumption of nitrogenous fertilisers to phosphorus and potassium fertilisers together was 81%, which is less than the previous year. While farmers claim that they use it to eradicate diseases and pest menace, officials admit that the use of fertilisers is callous and without caution.\nAccording to the data, the use of chemical pesticides in the paddy crop increased from 59.2 MT to 68.5 MT from 2021-22 to 2023-24. Except for vegetables and coconut, all other crops like spices and arecanut are high, while there is a slight decrease in the usage in banana from 49.2 MT to 46 MT from 2021-22 to 2023-24. For the banana crop, it was as high as 57 MT in 2022-23.\n\"Even though it is put in the larger category of spices, the major usage is in cardamom. I believe that there is underreporting on the usage of pesticides and there is no clear idea on how they are getting this data because often farmers will not disclose the usage. So, I don't believe that it has come down, though it shows that there is a drop in the previous year,\" said AD Dileep Kumar of Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India.\nNormally herbicides and weedicides are used as plant-killers and are used to destroy unwanted plants in an area. These are harmful chemicals, which not only kill unwanted plants but also stay in the environment, harming life in general. The report said as part of quality control enforcement of fertilisers, pesticides, biofertilisers and organic manures distributed in the state, samples were collected from outlets and analysed in departmental laboratories. Accordingly, 2,212 pesticide samples, 4,276 fertiliser samples and 53 biofertiliser and organic manure samples were analysed.\nStay updated with breaking news , bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march .\nEnd of Article FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
