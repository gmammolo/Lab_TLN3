  "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — The inspector found cooked food in re-used cans at this week’s low-scoring restaurant, a violation we’ve never reported before. The place is located in Knoxville. The grade is a 72 at Chef’s Asian Cuisine on Hardin Valley Road, in West Knoxville. This is a passing grade as any grade of 69 and below is considered failing. Chef’s Asian Cuisine, 10612 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville — Grade: 72 The inspector wrote he watched an employee drinking a beverage while walking around the kitchen preparing food. You might do that at home, but drinking and eating while preparing food at restaurants is not allowed. Chicken wings that an employee was eating were found left on top of a container of shrimp sauce. Wouldn’t you know it, the lid on the sauce was loose, thus possibly contaminating the sauce. No date markings were found on cooked shrimp and cooked vegetables in the walk-in coolers. The date of first use is required to be marked on all ready-to-eat food and it must be used within seven days to assure its wholesomeness. Bags of thawing shrimp were found on a kitchen table at 54 degrees, a temperature that invites the rapid growth of bacteria. The shrimp should have been in the refrigerator thawing at 41 degrees and below. The temperature of cooked broccoli left on a food prep table was 125 degrees. But 135 and above is the safe hot temperature to kill bacteria. Finally, several metal cans were being reused to store cooked foods. Once a can is opened, it should be thrown away and foods should be stored in food-grade containers. Chef’s Asian Cuisine will be re-inspected soon. If you notice something wrong while dining out, let the manager know or file a complaint with the health department in the county where you live. An inspector will be sent out for an unannounced visit. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WATE 6 On Your Side.",
