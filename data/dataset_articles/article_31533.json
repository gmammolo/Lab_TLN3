  "text": "WORCESTER — Without participating in a clinical trial at UMass Chan Medical School, 4-year-old Noa Greenwood would probably have to rely on a feeding tube and be unable to speak or attend Boston Public Schools.\nThe clinical trial has given the girl a fresh chance at life after being diagnosed in 2021 with Canavan disease, a rare degenerative neurological disorder with a “terrible prognosis [and] life expectancy,” said her father, Lee Greenwood. But the trial and others like it are now in jeopardy after the Trump administration moved to severely curtail the federal administrative research funds that support such work, a move UMass scientists and their advocates decried in an event Thursday.\n“My reaction was shock, outrage, disbelief, all of those feelings of, I just don’t understand how we can ... be so inhumane as a culture,” Lee Greenwood told the Globe.\nAdvertisement\nSeated around a U-shaped table in a third-floor room overlooking the UMass Medical School campus, local doctors, researchers, health care providers, and patients spoke about how losing significant portions of NIH funding could derail the university’s biomedical research innovations and pioneering treatments.\nThe roundtable followed a Trump administration order to cap the NIH’s reimbursements of “indirect costs” — overhead costs such as maintenance and lab space — at 15 percent. A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the change last week, but the looming cuts have put Massachusetts researchers on edge . A hearing is scheduled for Friday in Boston in a lawsuit 22 states including Massachusetts filed to block the order.\nThe Trump administration has defended the change as slashing wasteful taxpayer spending.\n“Contrary to the hysteria, redirecting billions of allocated NIH spending away from administrative bloat means there will be more money and resources available for legitimate scientific research, not less,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said last week.\nThe 15 percent cap would mean UMass Chan Medical School could stand to lose $41 million in annual funding, given its 2024 NIH administrative funding levels, one data analysis showed .\n“We just cannot take this,” said Guangping Gao, director of a gene therapy center at UMass, which runs the clinical trial involving Noa Greenwood. Gao said NIH funding of indirect costs has been integral to the growth of his work and other UMass research and clinical trials. Capping it at 15 percent will likely mean needing to “run business at a loss very soon,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nRepresentative James McGovern, a Democrat whose district includes Worcester, who convened the roundtable, said he’ll return to Washington on Sunday for “the fight of our lives,” pushing back on NIH cuts and House Republicans’ push for up to $2.3 trillion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade.\n“Every day in these last few weeks, we’ve had to fight back against the new president’s illegal executive orders like the ones cutting critical research projects,” McGovern said. “I’ve never met a person who is in favor of fraud, waste, and abuse, and to suggest that somehow investments in medical research are fraud, waste, and abuse is unbelievably out of touch with reality.”\nGuangping Gao, director of a gene therapy center at UMass, spoke to Noa Greenwood, 4, one of his center's clinical trial participants at an event Thursday highlighting the potential harms of NIH funding cuts. Stella Tannenbaum, Globe staff Massachusetts takes in the most NIH dollars per capita of any state , with research institutions, universities, and hospitals in the state poised to lose more than half a billion dollars if the biomedical research funding cuts take effect.\nDr. Katherine Luzuriaga, vice provost for research at UMass Chan Medical School, has been a pediatric infectious disease specialist for over 30 years, and she said residents in the emergency rooms now would never see some of the medical problems that were commonplace when she was starting out.\n“They won’t see them because we have had advances in basic science that told us about the building blocks or the basis for the disease, and then we’ve been able to take that information and translate it to the clinic,” she said. “And all of that has required NIH funded infrastructure.”\nAdvertisement",
