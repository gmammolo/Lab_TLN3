  "text": "The Trump administration has directed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to indefinitely postpone a public meeting of its vaccine advisory panel, a key forum for the nation’s discussion of information about vaccine safety and effectiveness.\nExperts say vaccines are safe and effective, but the independent 19-member vaccine advisory panel meets regularly to review the latest scientific evidence, vote on recommendations to the CDC director and present data on vaccine safety and effectiveness. As HHS secretary, experts fear that Kennedy — who has asserted the panel fails to adequately test vaccines and be transparent about safety data — could use his authority to potentially steer vaccine skeptics onto the advisory committee or to abolish the panel altogether.\nAndrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said the meeting scheduled for Feb. 26 to 28 will not take place, and would be “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.” No date has been set for a rescheduled meeting.\nPublic health groups criticized the postponement of the federal advisory committee meeting, saying it would delay action and public discussion on pressing infectious diseases threats, including one of the worst flu seasons in years.\nAn executive order signed Wednesday night by President Donald Trump aimed at cutting federal bureaucracy, included language on cutting “unnecessary” federal advisory committees.\nDuring Kennedy’s confirmation hearing, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) said he received commitments from Kennedy that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems and not establish parallel systems. “If confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes,” Cassidy said in a Feb. 4 Senate speech.\nA draft agenda for the three-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that was to take place includes information about 10 vaccines, including the effectiveness of influenza vaccine and a presentation on possible side effects of a newly approved vaccine to prevent chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease that causes fever and joint pain.\nPanel members were scheduled to vote on recommendations for the use of the chikungunya vaccine, a new meningitis vaccine, and new recommendations on influenza and vaccines for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common respiratory virus that can be especially dangerous for babies.\nThe Food and Drug Administration licenses vaccines, but clinicians wait for recommendations from the CDC advisory panel to understand the best ways to use them. In addition, insurance generally does not cover new vaccines without a recommendation from the vaccine panel.\nNews about the postponed meeting drew swift reaction. More than 50 medical experts and organizations sent a letter to Kennedy, Cassidy and the CDC’s acting director, Susan Monarez, to preserve the panel’s meeting and agenda.\nThe meeting holds “tremendous weight and relevance,” said the letter, which included signatories from the American Medical Association, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease. “Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats.”\nThe meetings are held three times a year. They are usually all-day meetings and discussions and votes are broadcast through a live video stream, the type of activities in which “a thoughtful, transparent and well-organized scientific community engages,” the letter said.\nMaking America healthy, part of Kennedy’s signature “Make America Health Again” mantra, “requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions,” the letter said. “This meeting should to be no different.”\nJamie Loehr, a physician and panel member who was scheduled to present data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, said he was disappointed that the scheduled meeting had been postponed.\n“The ACIP is an voluntary panel of experts which has met regularly for over 50 years, providing the American medical community and American citizens guidance on when and how to use lifesaving vaccines,” Loehr said. During the coronavirus pandemic, the panel went far beyond the call of duty, he said, working 16 hour days and meeting monthly, sometimes weekly, to provide the American public with a vaccine that saved millions of lives.\n“I hope the American public will not infer from this decision to postpone the meeting that I have any hesitation regarding the benefits and safety of recommended vaccines,” he said.\nImmunization advocates, who had warned that Kennedy’s repeated disparaging of vaccines and falsely linking them to autism could undermine established science about the safety of vaccines, criticized the delay.\nKelly Moore, president and CEO of Immunize.org, a nonprofit focused on vaccination education for health-care professionals, said organizations had been looking forward to this meeting, especially the data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine this season, “given that this has been the most severe flu season in 15 years for people of all ages,” she said.\n“We know many people are still unvaccinated against influenza this year, and they can still be helped by vaccination now as this severe season continues in full swing,” she said.\nWithout the meeting, Americans will also have to wait indefinitely for the recommendations for newly licensed vaccines for other diseases, she said.\nRegular meetings of the panel are scheduled months in advance, with notice about public comment for each meeting. Meetings where votes will take place must allow a period for public comment.\nFor weeks, CDC officials have been asking whether the meeting could proceed, but without formal approval to go ahead, appropriate notice for public comment was not opened. HHS officials imposed an abrupt halt on external communications by CDC and other health agencies a month ago, disrupting the flow of much basic information from the agencies to other health organizations and community groups.\nHHS spokesman Nixon said the vaccine advisory panel’s work groups — or subcommittees focused on reviewing relevant data and developing recommendations to present to the full panel — met as scheduled this month and will present at an upcoming ACIP meeting.",
