  "text": "Senator Ossoff raises concerns over Medicaid cuts\nSAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - Republicans in Congress are proposing $880 billion in cuts to the committee that oversees Medicaid. They say it’s part of a broader plan to reduce government spending and cut taxes.\nBut Senator Ossoff says these cuts could have devastating effects on children, seniors, and hospitals across the state.\nRight now, Medicaid covers about 40% of all children, nearly half of all births, and about 70% of seniors in nursing homes.\nOssoff said slashing funds could put millions at risk of losing coverage and push more rural hospitals closer to shutting down.\nAs of last year, more than half of Georgia’s rural hospitals are struggling financially. Nine have closed, one stopped providing inpatient care, and 18 are at risk of shutting down.\nOssoff says Georgia’s long-standing refusal to expand Medicaid has already limited access to health care, and further cuts would only make the situation worse.\n“I am sounding the alarm that these proposed drastic cuts to Medicaid will fundamentally damage the health and safety of my constituents in Georgia,” said Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia. “It will put kids at risk, pregnant women, and delivering mothers at risk, seniors in nursing homes at risk, and hospitals across our state into dire financial jeopardy.”\nIt’s unclear whether these cuts will actually happen. Just this week, President Trump said Medicaid “isn’t going to be touched.”\nAnd some Senate Republicans are pushing back, saying the House proposal goes too far.\nCopyright 2025 WTOC.
