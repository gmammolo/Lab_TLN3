  "text": "Srinagar, Feb 20: Kashmir recorded 90 disease outbreaks across 10 districts in 2024, as documented by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of the Directorate of Health Services Kashmir (DHSK), officials said on Tuesday.\nDr. Samina Gul, State Surveillance Officer IDSP (who spoke to Rising Kashmir on Feb 18 before she got transferred and posted as I/C DNO, Kashmir) said that these outbreaks included hepatitis, acute diarrheal disease and chickenpox.\nHepatitis A, a waterborne disease, was mostly reported in the last months of the previous year in different parts of the valley including in south and north Kashmir.\n“Our rapid response teams, including state and district surveillance units under DHSK, are on alert and deployed as soon as cases are reported,” she said.\nThe department has strengthened IDSP, enabling a decentralized response through trained multi-disciplinary Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) to implement necessary public health measures.\n“For example, gastrointestinal (GI) disease is seasonal, often caused by unhygienic food consumption, particularly among children. Lack of awareness and poor hygiene contribute to its spread,” Dr. Samina said.\nWhen an outbreak occurs, the department conducts IEC activities. Community health officers raise awareness, and public announcements via loudspeakers on ambulances inform people about hygiene and safe drinking water practices.\nThe state IDSP team remains in touch with the central IDSP team for guidance. “Once outbreaks are reported, immediate measures are taken to break the chain of transmission. It is always a team effort,” she added.\nUnder IDSP, the health department manages both treatment and surveillance. “Village heads are asked to make announcements via loudspeakers, which has proven effective in rural areas,” she said.\nKashmir reports 90 disease outbreaks across 10 districts in 2024\nLeave a Comment",
