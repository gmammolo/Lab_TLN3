  "text": "Eating disorders among college students increased 13% from 2013 to 2021-22, according to a 2022 study published by Science Direct. As cases of this complex issue rise, UCF Health’s Student Health Services (SHS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) reminds the campus community the university is here to help those in need.\nEating Disorder Awareness Week is Feb. 24-March 2.\nMultidisciplinary treatment is the standard of care for eating disorders, says Caiti Bradbury, a licensed mental health counselor with CAPS. To provide this support, UCF has an Eating Disorder Management Team (EDMT), which includes professionals like Bradbury, as well as medical providers, dietitians, therapists, psychiatrists and, sometimes, substance abuse clinician from SHS and CAPS.\nSHS, CAPS and the EDMT aim to empower students to seek education, support and treatment as they are comfortable and ready to do so.\n“Any treatment advice we provide is always a recommendation, not a requirement. If you decide after that meeting that you aren’t quite ready to pursue treatment, you’ll have acquired some knowledge of how to get started when you are ready,” says Rebecca Kuerbitz, a primary care provider with SHS and EDMT member.\nHere Bradbury and Kuerbitz share insight on eating disorders and how students can get help.\nWhat are some common eating disorders and their symptoms?\nRebecca Kuerbitz (RK): Eating disorders are defined as a persistent disturbance of eating behavior that impairs health or psychosocial functioning. The most common are binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, avoidant/restrictive foot intake disorder and disordered eating that doesn’t fit into other categories. Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating in which the person eats a large amount of food in a short period of time accompanied by feeling a loss of control overeating with some distress (like disgust, guilt or depression) after the binge.\nBulimia nervosa, like binge eating disorder, involves recurrent episodes of binging but binging is followed by a compensatory behavior such as purging, excessive exercise or misuse of medications like insulin. Compensatory behaviors are typically influenced by a person’s concern about their body shape and weight.\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that is characterized by restriction of caloric intake that leads to a low body weight. It is accompanied by an intense fear of gaining weight and distorted perception of body shape.\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a more recently recognized eating disorder that involves food restriction and/or avoidance due to anxiety about certain foods. This leads to low body weight and nutritional deficiency but is not due to fear of weight gain or distorted perception of body shape or weight. Often people with ARFID will have only a few different foods that are comfortable eating.\nHow prevalent are eating disorders? Are some types of eating disorders more common than others?\nRK: There is a lifetime prevalence of eating disorder of 8% in females and 2% in males.\nCaiti Bradbury (CB): The most common diagnoses are anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder among college students. ARFID, although less common, has become increasingly prevalent in recent years.\nWhat are some common misconceptions about eating disorders?\nCB: One major myth is that eating disorders are simply about food, when, in reality, they stem from deeper emotional and psychological issues, such as control, self-esteem and past trauma. Another misconception is that only women are affected but eating disorders impact people of all genders. It’s also not true that everyone with an eating disorder is underweight — disorders like bulimia and binge eating can occur in people of all body sizes. Some believe eating disorders are a choice or a temporary fad or are solely about appearance, but they are serious mental health conditions that require professional treatment and can be lethal. The idea that those with eating disorders are seeking attention is also false; most individuals hide their symptoms due to shame and guilt. Furthermore, recovery isn’t simply about gaining or losing weight, as eating disorders are long-term conditions requiring ongoing treatment, even after physical health improves. Many also think eating disorders are rare, but they affect millions of people across all demographics. Finally, while media and societal pressure can contribute, eating disorders are influenced by a combination of genetic, psychological and environmental factors.\nWhat should students who are seeking help with eating disorders expect from the treatment process here at UCF?\nRK: They can expect compassionate care from therapists at CAPS, nutritional guidance from our registered dietitian, medical care to address any health concerns by one of our primary care providers and psychiatric care from our Behavioral Health providers, if needed.\nWhat advice would you give to students who are hesitant to seek help for an eating disorder, or for family and friends who want to support someone in need?\nCB: To family and friends, I’d say don’t be judgmental and avoid comments or criticisms about one’s physical appearance and eating habits. For those in need, there is no shame in seeking help. You deserve to have a life you can feel proud of and enjoy without feeling consumed by thoughts of food or body image.\nStudents who are struggling with eating disorders are encouraged to set up an appointment at SHS or CAPS. Join SHS and CAPS for UCF Loves EveryBODY, a celebration of self-love with photo booths, ask a dietitian and FreshU, and more, Feb. 26 at Ferrell Commons 10 a.m.-noon.",
