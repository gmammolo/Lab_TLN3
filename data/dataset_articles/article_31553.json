  "text": "Legendary rock band Kansas ’s front-man Ronnie Platt has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The 64-year-old lead singer revealed his condition to fans in a post on Facebook on Saturday. “For all of you asking, Tuesday I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer but before everyone gets all excited, it has a 99% survival rate, it has not spread,” Platt wrote. “It’s contained to my thyroid. I just have to have my thyroid removed. Go through some rehab time and be right back in the saddle.” Platt added: “I sincerely appreciate everyone’s positive thoughts and prayers. I have some absolutely amazing people going to bat for me!! as it has been put to me, this is just a bump in the road and will be behind me very soon! So everyone please CARRY ON!￼” Kansas was formed in 1973 and released its most recent album, The Absence of Presence , in July 2020. In the wake of his diagnosis, the band rescheduled shows in Catoosa, Okla., and Durant, Okla, and canceled two shows in New Orleans and Lake Charles, Louisiana.
