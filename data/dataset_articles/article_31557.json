  "text": "The new year did not start off well for me. It all began the day after Christmas when I awoke with a severe sore throat and could barely talk. This became a bad cold, which led to a sinus infection, which triggered my asthma, and then the meds I was taking made my blood pressure skyrocket. The grand finale to this three-week vicious cycle was a migraine headache. During this time my daughter took me to two doctor appointments and made three trips to the pharmacy. I’d have a day or two in between ailments when I felt better, hoping I was on the mend, and then I’d be back to making phone calls and texting to cancel appointments, my usual activities and social events. On Jan. 1 I was feeling fairly good, and non-contagious, and joined friends Nancy and Lynne for a New Year’s brunch. Our conversation drifted from New Year’s resolutions we’d made through the years (and rarely kept) to the gratitude journals we’d all done at some time in our lives (and felt it worthwhile). Then Lynne said she was trying something new this year: She is going to write one thing that made her happy that day on a slip of paper and put it in a jar or box and then at year’s end she will randomly draw out several to celebrate happy reminders of 2025. Nancy and I liked this idea and, while I haven’t checked to see if they are actually doing this, I am. It was shortly after my decision to pursue this when I was downed with another ailment and it became a stretch to think of anything to write on that day’s slip of paper. But then I’d do some mental reviewing and recall that morning’s beautiful sunrise when I’d watched the sky turn into breathtaking shades of pink; or the nightly phone call from my daughter; or opening my mail box to find an actual handwritten letter from a longtime friend. It could be just enjoying a walk on a rare sunny January day ... having a good book to read. Sometimes in our busyness we miss the small, but important and happy moments of our days. On Jan. 12 my horoscope read: “Optimism and negativity might clash in the coming week. You might stay positive by reading inspirational books.” Was it just a coincidence when later that day I found a book on the hall bench, where residents leave magazines and books for others, that fulfilled that prediction? The book is “Wherever You Go, There You Are - Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life” by Jon Kabat-Zinn, and was just what I needed to help me through another dreary week of missed events and not being able to socialize. The book has three parts: \"The Bloom of the Present Moment,\" \"The Heart of Practice\" and \"In the Spirit of Mindfulness,\" and covers anything you could possibly want to know about “mindfulness.\" It was reassuring to find I’ve been doing many of the “practices” for several years without realizing I was being “mindful.” It also validated my horoscope by being an “inspirational book” which helped me stay positive while recuperating. For now the book is staying on my bookshelf instead of being returned to the hallway bench. In mid-January I signed up for a Winter Wellness Retreat on Jan. 31 hoping I’d be fully recovered by then, which I was. The venue was the historic Laundry Building here at Mary’s Woods which was warm and welcoming on a dreary and rainy afternoon. It began with time for body awareness exercises, then a discussion on mindfulness, followed by a presentation on the singing bowls. We found places on the floor mats or chairs and let the vibrations and tones created by the bowls waft over us, releasing tension and stress. I walked back to my apartment with the rain rhythmically falling on my umbrella and feeling relaxed, de-stressed and ready to begin February with a new energy. There was no problem writing a happiness note that day. And so the mid-winter days pass by and my daily happy notes are adding up. I must check with Nancy and Lynne to see if they are participating. Both have had surgeries since our New Year’s brunch date so they would certainly be excused for missing a few days. I’m thankful to be back into the rhythm of my normal life … with a few added practices to improve my mindfulness.
