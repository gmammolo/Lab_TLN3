  "text": "Mote Marine Lab deploys new tools against red tide FOX 13's Kimberly Kuizon reports on Mote Marine Laboratory testing the efficiency of two new products developed to fight against red tide bloom in Venice and how the results inspired confidence from scientists.\nThe Brief Two products developed by the Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative called Clear and Xtreme were launched by Mote Marine Laboratory. The products produced a 70% kill rate of the red tide in two Venice canals, inspiring optimism from scientists. Scientists say they need to take this success and test the kill rates of more red tides in canals and waterways in Venice and the state. VENICE, Fla. - Dead fish floated along two canals in Venice as toxins from red tide kept residents inside.\n\"One of the most impactful things was standing on the seawalls with the residents right next to where we were deploying,\" said Kevin Claridge, Mote Marine Laboratory’s vice president for Sponsored Research and Coastal Policy Programs.\nREAD: Florida Wingstop manager throws hot grease, ranch dressing at customers during argument\nMote Marine Laboratory testing the kill rate of red tide on Thursday.\nThe backstory:\nAfter about five years of research, non-stop testing and finally receiving regulatory approval, Mote Marine Laboratory deployed two products from the Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative.\n\"Many of them were saying it was unbearable to be out and just sit on their patio and enjoy the nice day they were having because of the red tide,\" said Claridge.\nThe products, called Clear and Xtreme, were developed by Mote Scientists Dr. Dana Wetzel, Dr. Richard Pierce and the Heartland Energy Group before being used in the canals.\nCLICK HERE:>>> Follow FOX 13 on YouTube\n\"The two products we were working with are plant-based natural compounds. We devised a special deployment mechanism in partnership with a company that does oil spill and hazard waste cleanup,\" said Claridge.\nDig deeper:\nTesting started immediately, and the results were exciting.\n\"A 70% kill rate of the Karenia brevis. That’s a win for us. I think it’s a pretty good suppression of Karenia. You won’t completely knock it out of the water column, and we don’t want to eliminate it from the natural environment, but you want to knock it back where it’s causing the environment&apos;s ecological impacts,\" said Claridge.\nMote Marine Laboratory’s President and CEO Dr. Michael Crosby said he didn’t doubt what would happen.\nREAD: Trial set to begin for woman whose car went airborne killing passenger\n\"This stuff works and does no greater harm to the environment than the red tide is doing,\" said Crosby.\nWhat's next:\nMote Marine Laboratory has other products to deploy pending review and approval from the EPA. They’re hoping to scale up deployment to an active bloom.\n\"This won’t be a success if we can only do a canal or two. We have to be able to really view this a little more as a military operation and being able to attack with deployment of these compounds and methods wherever that red tide is,\" said Crosby.\nThe Source: FOX 13's Kimberly Kuizon collected the information in this story.\nWatch FOX 13 News: STAY CONNECTED WITH FOX 13 TAMPA:\nDownload the FOX Local app for your smart TV Download FOX Local mobile app: Apple | Android Download the FOX 13 News app for breaking news alerts, latest headlines Download the SkyTower Radar app Sign up for FOX 13’s daily newsletter Venice Environment Red Tide DAILY NEWSLETTER All the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm that I have read and agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service .\nTrending\nSixth teenager arrested for brutal Davis Islands dog park attack",
