  "text": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-20/bird-flu-kills-dairy-workers-cats-suggesting-a-viral-change\nTwo house cats died after contracting bird flu in the homes of dairy workers, a troubling sign that the virus may be moving between species and becoming more widespread.\nThe cats' owners lived in separate households in Michigan and developed symptoms of H5N1 last May, according to a[report]released Thursday by the[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. Both worked on farms that had cases of bird flu and displayed symptoms before the cats fell ill, but declined testing.\nOne of the cats was known to roll around in the worker's dirty clothes, indicating the virus could have spread from the clothes to the cat. Both cats displayed respiratory and neurological issues after infection, the report said.\nOutdoor cats have been reported to die from H5N1 infection after drinking raw milk or exposure to infected animals, including cattle and poultry. The study, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, was the first to find indoor cats with the infection.\nThis is the CDC study that was abruptly pulled a few weeks back. These are cases from all the way back in May of 2024, so the virus has definitely evolved since thenTwenty-four veterinary staff members had interacted with the infected cats. Seven of them reported symptoms of illness, but the five who agreed to testing did not have the bird flu virus, according to the CDC report.",
