  "text": "The search continues for a North Carolina man who has been missing for nearly a month.\nClinton Bonnell, 50, was last seen in the Gray’s Creek community on January 27. Though details are scarce, Bonnell’s sister told WTVD one of his last known locations was at the Fit4Life gym in Fayetteville.\nAfter leaving the gym, Bonnell is believed to have gone to Methodist University, where he is enrolled in the physician assistant program. He texted a friend he was heading home, but alarms were raised when he did not return to school the next day, according to WTVD.\n“I know what he was doing the day that he disappeared and he was making plans for his life, and studying for exams the next day. I mean, all signs point to him vanishing not on his own accord,” his sister commented.\nBonnell was reportedly a Green Beret medic, and his sister told The Fayetteville Observer that he retired from the military a month before his disappearance.\n“He was happy and doing really well,” she said.\n“He was not the type of veteran that has no focus, no drive and feels lost after retirement. He was excited.”\nAccording to The Fayetteville Observer, Bonnell’s phone has been off since January 28. Cumberland County police conducted a welfare check at his home and only located his car.\nBonnell was described as being 6 feet tall and weighing 195 pounds. He last was seen wearing a plaid button-up shirt, a black hoodie, and brown pants.\nAnyone with information regarding Bonnell’s whereabouts is asked to call Sergeant J. McLeod at 910-677-5548 or Cumberland County Crimestoppers at 910-483-TIPS.\n[Feature Photo: Cumberland County police]",
