  "text": "Grimes, also known as Claire Elise Boucher, recently reached out to Elon Musk on social media regarding a ‘medical crisis’ involving their child. This plea for help came as the ‘First Buddy’ (Musk) was wielding a chainsaw alongside Javier Millei at CPAC.\nThe singer and artist Grimes shares three children with Elon Musk, who is publicly known to have 13 kids. A conservative influencer, Ashley St. Clair, recently claimed to be the mother of Musk’s 13th child.\nIssues around custody of their children have caused conflicts between Grimes and the renowned entrepreneur, particularly her disapproval of Musk showcasing their son X during a press event in the Oval Office with former President Donald Trump.\nMusk attended the Conservative Political Action Conference with Argentina Prime Minister Javier Millei, where he held up a chainsaw while wearing aviator sunglasses and a MAGA hat to represent the cuts he was making to the federal government.\nIn a since deleted post to Musk-owned X Grimes responded to a tweet Musk made Wednesday with more pressing matters regarding one of their offspring.\n‘Plz respond about our child’s medical crisis. I am sorry to do this publicly but it is no longer acceptable to ignore this situation. This requires immediate attention,’ the Canadian singer wrote.\nShe clarified that Musk didn’t even have to respond to her but could contact her through a third party.\n‘If you don’t want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that we can move forward on solving this. This is urgent, Elon.’\nSocial media followers expressed their sympathies with Grimes in response and wondered why she was taking it public, saying the effects could cause permanent damage.\n‘I’m not giving any details but he won’t respond to texts call or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer life long impairment if he doesn’t respond asap, so I need him to f***ing respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that’s where we are at.’\nHe has yet to respond to Grimes’ message publicly, though he has made multiple posts to X since she asked for help.\nAfter Grimes deleted the post, she was informed by a follower that her original tweet had been ‘shadowbanned’ by X.\nShe could only respond: ‘lol.’\nMusk, who has become Trump´s close adviser spearheading a massive effort to cut spending and downsize the federal government, was set to meet with Milei, who was in Washington to attend CPAC.\nThe ‘First Buddy’ was announced as a speaker for the conference earlier on Thursday by Mercedes Schlapp, a CPAC organizer.\nThe scheduled meeting between Musk and Milei was confirmed by a person who insisted on anonymity to discuss an event that hadn´t yet been announced publicly and said the meeting was private and had been planned for weeks.\nMilei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won the election, but before he took office. He was also invited to the inauguration.\nA self-described ‘anarcho-capitalist,’ Milei has received praise frequently from Musk for implementing a series of austerity measures, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects to fix Argentina´s long mismanaged economy.\nGrimes and Musk welcomed their first child, X., in May 2020 and originally gave their son the name X Æ A-12, which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet.\nThey then changed the child’s name to X Æ A-Xii. and received plenty of criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce.\nThe following year they welcomed their daughter Exa Dark Sideræl via surrogacy.\nIn between then and welcoming their son Tao in 2023, the couple ‘semi-separated’ and in January 2022, Grimes said of Musk: ‘I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid.’\nHowever, two months later in March 2022, she described Musk as her ‘best friend and the love of my life.’\nFollowing the birth of their third child, Grimes sued Musk in September 2023 over parental rights to their children in a California court. Musk allegedly fought to keep the hearing closed, asking for the documents to be sealed.\nUpon seeing her son in the Oval office, Grimes berated her former flame on social media and said: ‘He should not be in public like this. I did not see this, thank you for alerting me. But I’m glad he was polite. Sigh.’\nThe singer revealed in November last year that she has been in a year-long custody battle with Musk, during which time she allegedly did not see one of her children for five months.\nMusk sued for for custody of the children he shares with Grimes in Texas, where his businesses are headquartered.\nGrimes then counter-sued filing a ‘petition to establish parental relationship’ in a California court, typically seen as the first step in suing for custody for unmarried parents.\nShe claimed that Musk was withholding access to her kids and even prevented them from seeing their terminally ill maternal grandmother.\nA Travis County Clerk confirmed that the Texas dispute had been settled, but declined to give further details.\nGrimes claimed the ordeal almost left her ‘bankrupt’ and unable to make new music.",
