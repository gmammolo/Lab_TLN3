  "text": "MERCER COUNTY, Ohio (WLIO) - Mercer County declared an emergency earlier this week due to the effects of the bird flu.\nThe county commissioners passed a resolution requesting state and federal support for producers to assist with containment, eradication, and recovery efforts related to the disease. The resolution could help local farmers by potentially providing emergency funding to keep their farms operational. Poultry farming is a key component of Mercer County’s economy, providing essential food products to the region, state, and nation.\n\"It affects not only the poultry producers, but it affects the whole community. I mean, for the suppliers, the truck drivers that bring in the feed ingredients, the local hardware store, the local electrician, the plumber, it affects everybody in the community. It's not just the poultry farm itself, but everybody as a whole. So we have to try to work as a team here, to try to do the best we can to get this under control here,\" said Rick Muhlenkamp, Mercer County Commissioner.\nAccording to the Mercer County Health Department, there is still only one reported human case of bird flu, and officials are working to help the community monitor any potential cases.\n\"We work with all the local hospitals, the health care providers, and the labs to make sure they have the right testing available to them. If anybody tests positive for influenza A and they meet the criteria, those tests can be sent on for additional testing to do subtype testing,\" stated Deb Scheer, epidemiologist, Mercer County Health Department.\nResidents who were exposed to the virus and begin experiencing symptoms are urged to contact their health care provider immediately.",
