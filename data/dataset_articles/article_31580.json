  "text": "Dear Editor:\nThe Trump Administration is drastically cutting medical research grants by reducing allowable indirect costs from an average 65% to 15%. At WVU, the cuts to cancer and heart research programs total $12 million. Why should you care? Let me explain why this is so devastating to WVU and all research institutions.\nOrganizations have direct costs and indirect costs, and both are necessary for operating the business. For example, when you buy a burger at McDonald’s, the cost of the food, the cook, and the server are direct costs; everything else is indirect: the building, stoves, freezers, tables and chairs, maintenance, cleaning, utilities, the restaurant manager, as well as corporate costs for HR, procurement, shipping, administration, etc.\nIf the price of your burger does not pay the indirect costs, then the restaurant will not remain in business for very long. In many businesses, the indirect costs exceed the direct, that is, the indirect rate is over 100%.\nThe same principle applies to research hospitals. A research grant reimburses the hospital for the direct costs of conducting that research: the salaries of the research team, lab equipment specific to that research project and participant costs. The grant must also pay its portion of the indirect costs, the things needed to keep the doors open: the buildings, heat, water, electricity, Internet, maintenance, supplies, support staff, labs, and so on. You cannot have a research center without incurring all of those indirect costs.\nIn the particular case of the WVU Medical Center in Morgantown, that facility saved Bob’s life, and it was able to do so only because it is a research hospital, attracting some of the world’s best talent — researchers as well as providers. The world-renowned surgeon who operated on Bob had to perform a cardiac procedure never before performed anywhere (and he got an article in the New England Journal of Medicine out of it). By the way, he is an immigrant from Syria. If NIH cuts its grant funding to WVU, cardiac researchers like him will bail out, and we will all lose out as a result.\nMary Helen also benefited from life-saving surgery at WVU. With stage 4 colon cancer, a surgeon at the WVU Cancer Center removed multiple tumors, and advanced chemotherapy treatments pulled her through. Without cancer research funding, such life-saving measures are not possible.\nThe research taking place at WVU has brought many outstanding doctors from around the world to the hospital. We all benefit from their expertise. We will all lose if they leave, and our society will lose big time if these brilliant researchers leave the United States.\nIt’s not just cancer and cardiovascular research centers that are adversely impacted by these funding cuts. To remain at the forefront of medicine and many other scientific fields, our government must continue to provide the funds that sustain research.\nBob and Mary Helen Spear,\nSwanton",
