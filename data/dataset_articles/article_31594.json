  "text": "JOPLIN, Mo. (KOAM) - Community Blood Center of the Ozarks (CBCO) is calling on donors to help replenish the local blood supply after recent winter storms forced the cancellation of over 600 donations. CBCO, the exclusive blood supplier for 45 area healthcare facilities, says O-negative, A-negative, and O-positive blood types are especially needed. \"If the roads are safe, we urge all Winter Weather Warriors to donate,\" said Michelle Teter, CBCO Media Relations Representative. \"Every donation makes a lifesaving difference.\" To encourage donations, CBCO is hosting an Extra Extra Winter Weather Promotion at its donor centers in Joplin, Bentonville, and Springdale on Friday, February 21, from 8 AM – 2 PM. Donors will receive a $10 Walmart e-gift card, a limited-edition hoodie, and a chance to win up to $56,000 in VISA gift cards through the 56-Day Challenge. Appointments can be scheduled at www.cbco.org or by calling 417-227-5006, but walk-ins are welcome. COPYRIGHT 2025 BY KOAM NEWS NOW. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
