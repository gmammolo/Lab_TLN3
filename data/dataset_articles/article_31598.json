  "text": "Sports\nVictor Wembanyama’s Season-Ending Injury Gets Unique Chris Bosh Update\nVictor Wembanyama's season is officially over, as the San Antonio Spurs announced that he is dealing with a worrisome blood clot issue in his right shoulder. Immediately after this news came out, fans everywhere thought of the legendary Chris Bosh, whose career was largely derailed due to his own issues with blood clots.\nThe official diagnosis for Wembanyama's injury is deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, which is the same ailment Bosh dealt with towards the end of his career. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, the ailment began to impact Wembanyama during the All-Star festivities in San Francisco, California.\n\"I'm told that Victor Wembanyama had started to feel symptomatic, and he went into the post All-Star break, Monday, Tuesday, taking time for himself, taking down time, and hoped to feel better. But, he did not. He was still feeling symptomatic from my understanding,\" Charania said on \"NBA Today.\"\nBosh dealt with recurring blood clots in his legs that ultimately forced him out of the NBA. The fear, given that Wembanyama's ailment is the exact same as Bosh's, was that he would suffer a similar fate as the legendary big man. However, reports have indicated that Wembanyama's case is not as severe as Bosh's was.\n\"To address some understandable concerns: Spurs are optimistic Wembanyama will recover in time for next season. Not worried about his long-term health. I'm told this is not as serious as the Chris Bosh blood clot issue,\" Mike Finger of the San Antonio Express-News reported in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n— Mike Finger (@mikefinger)[February 20, 2025]\nWembanyama's second season in the NBA saw him finish with averages of 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 3.7 rebounds per game on 47.6% shooting from the field. He also was leading the league in blocks per game with 3.8, which made him the frontrunner to win the Defensive Player of the Year award.\nThat won't be possible now that Wembanyama won't play in the minimum 60-game threshold to qualify for the award, though. The main concern is Wembanayama's health now, and all eyes will be on him to see if he can find his way back on the court next season.\nRelated: NBA Insider's Concerning Revelation About Victor Wembanyama's Season-Ending Injury\nCopyright 2025 Athlon Sports.
