  "text": "Costly research, diagnosis delays worsen cancer crisis in Tanzania\nWhat you need to know:\n- A study conducted by the research think-tank Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the National Council for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in India, and UK institutions has revealed that cancer patients often seek medical attention early, while the disease is still in its initial stages, but medical professionals fail to diagnose it correctly\nDar es Salaam. High cost of research, prolonged delays in diagnosis, and inefficient healthcare system are major barriers to effective cancer treatment in Tanzania, experts have warned.\nA study conducted by the research think-tank Economic and Social Research Foundation (ESRF) in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), the National Council for Biological Sciences (NCBS) in India, and UK institutions has revealed that cancer patients often seek medical attention early, while the disease is still in its initial stages, but medical professionals fail to diagnose it correctly.\nAs a result, patients, especially those with cervical, liver, and breast cancer, are frequently misdiagnosed with other illnesses such as urinary tract infections, stomach problems, and fever.\nThe concerns were raised during the launch of the book Cancer Care in Pandemic Times yesterday.\nSpeaking at the event, ESRF executive director, Prof Fortunate Makene, said cancer should be recognised as a socio-economic and developmental challenge that requires urgent and innovative solutions.\n“The findings in this book illuminate a painful reality,” she said. “Patients face significant challenges at every stage of their journey. Many experience delays navigating the healthcare system, leading to late-stage diagnosis, which complicates treatment and increases costs.”\nProf Makene added that the disease not only causes physical suffering but also imposes a financial burden, often forcing families to sell assets, take out loans, or abandon treatment due to high costs.\nAccording to her, the book explores various innovative solutions in drug manufacturing, medical technology, and service delivery to improve cancer care.\nShe said the book is not just an academic exercise. It serves as a roadmap for change,” she noted.\n“With insights drawn from Kenya, Tanzania, and India, it highlights that improving access to cancer care is possible through better planning and coordination.”\nHealth economist, Maureen Mackintosh, from the Open University in the UK noted that the research was based on the experiences of patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals working under challenging conditions.\n“A group of cancer survivors played a crucial role in shaping the early stages of the research by identifying key questions that needed to be addressed,” she said.\nDr Mercy Njeru from KEMRI stressed the need for a multi-sectoral approach in tackling cancer.\n“We cannot work in silos. It is not just a healthcare issue—we need collaboration with economists, social scientists, and policymakers. Linking the health sector with industry will help develop sustainable solutions,” she explained.\nProf Elia Mbaga from Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) highlighted the high cost of cancer research, particularly for diagnostics and screening.\n“We need to track cancer incidences and determine the most essential equipment for the country. This will help allocate resources more effectively and predict trends in different types of cancer,” he said.\nDirector of Cancer Prevention Services at Ocean Road Cancer Institute, Dr Crispin Kahesa, underscored the importance of prioritising resources.\n“We must optimize human resources, financial resources, and time allocation for researchers, patients, and mentorship programs,” he stated.\nThe book provides insights into the realities of cancer care in Tanzania and Kenya, offering practical recommendations to improve accessibility, affordability, and efficiency in treatment.\nIt also serves as a resource for manufacturers, importers, distributors, and those involved in the procurement of healthcare essentials.",
