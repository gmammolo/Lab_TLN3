  "text": "Toronto·New\nPeel Public Health warns of measles exposure in Brampton\nMore than 90 cases of measles confirmed in southwestern Ontario since January, says Ministry of Health\nAs measles outbreaks rise in parts of Ontario, Peel Public Health (PPH) is warning of a measles exposure at a Brampton clinic Sunday.\nAnyone who visited Cornerstone Medical Centre-Walk In Urgent Care and the adjoining pharmacy on Chinguacousy Road Unit from 1:52 p.m. to 5:13 p.m. on Feb. 16 may have been exposed to the measles virus, the public health agency said in a news release Thursday.\nAnyone who might have been exposed is advised to check their immunization record, as well as the records of their family members, to make sure they're up to date. Anyone experiencing symptoms, such as high fever, cough, red rash, red, watery eyes, is advised to contact their health care provider and stay home from work or school.\nOntario's Ministry of Health says over 90 cases of measles have been confirmed in southwestern Ontario since January. Many of those cases have been found in children, and almost all have involved people who are not unvaccinated.\nThe ministry is asking some health units in the province to accelerate and expand administering measles vaccines.\nPPH is advising people in Peel Region to make sure their measles vaccinations are up to date, especially as March Break approaches and many people plan to travel. All Ontarians over six months old are eligible for vaccination against measles if travelling, PPH says.\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease, PPH warns, and poses an increased risk of health complications to infants under the age of one, as well as unimmunized pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems.",
