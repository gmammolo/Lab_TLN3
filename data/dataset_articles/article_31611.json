  "text": "Baby boy hospitalized after being found unconscious in Glendale bathtub A 12-month-old boy has been rushed to the hospital after an incident at a West Valley home. Michael Raimondi reports. By Ben Bradley Published: Feb. 20, 2025 at 4:35 PM MST | Updated: 47 minutes ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nGLENDALE, AZ (AZFamily) — A 1-year-old boy is hospitalized after nearly drowning in a bathtub in Glendale early Thursday afternoon.\nRescue crews responded to an apartment on Keim Drive, near 59th Avenue and Bethany Home Road , shortly after 2 p.m. for the report that a young boy had been found unconscious in a bathtub.\nThe boy was rushed to a hospital where his current condition is unknown.\nAccording to Glendale police, the child’s mother had stepped away for a short amount of time before returning to find her son unresponsive.\nInvestigators did not say how long he had been left alone.\nPolice said they received multiple 911 calls but didn’t say who made them.\nPolice said it’s a sad reality that drowning calls happen when they are preventable.\n“Watch your kids around water,” said Glendale Police Officer Moroni Mendez. “It doesn’t matter the amount of water. It could be in a pool. It could be in a bathtub. It could be in a five-gallon bucket.”\nOther information was not immediately available.\nGlendale police officers and fire crews responded to a home on Keim Drive shortly after 2 p.m. Thursday.
