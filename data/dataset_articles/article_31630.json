  "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region (HSPPR) is only accepting emergency dog intakes for the next week after several dogs at its Colorado Springs location tested positive for strep zoo.\nAccording to the HSPPR, streptococcus zooepidemicus, also known as strep zoo, is a type of bacteria that can affect dogs. Symptoms typically include coughing, nasal discharge, vomiting, labored breathing and coughing blood.\nThe shelter said several dogs have tested positive for the bacteria. The infection was caught early, according to HSPPR, and there have been no fatal cases.\nHSPPR said the bacteria is spread through direct contact between dogs and contaminated objects, like shoes and bowls. It can be treated with antibiotics.\nDue to the presence of the bacteria, HSPPR is only accepting emergency dog intakes until Feb. 27. Emergency intakes include urgent medical cases or cases involving public safety.\nThe shelter is being deep cleaned, and all dogs at HSPPR are receiving prophylactic antibiotics. The Colorado Springs Wellness Clinic will also be closed for dog appointments for two weeks, according to HSPPR.\nThe shelter said owner surrender euthanasia services will continue.\nHSPPR said adoptions are still open. All adopted dogs will receive preventative treatment before leaving.\nIn the meantime, HSPPR is asking for donations to offset the \"significant\" cost of antibiotics. Donations can be made through this link.\nIf you find a stray, do not bring it to HSPPR. Instead, check for a microchip at a vet or the shelter's admissions entrance, but be sure to call ahead. The shelter is also asking people to house the stray and file a report on its website to reduce intake.\nBeloved brewery patio cut in half for parking as Denver eyes bigger changes\nLafayette's Rock Creek Curling hosts US Olympic Trials\nColorado lawmakers introduce bill to address misconduct at CBI crime lab\nCDPHE investigation reveals errors in water testing impacting five schools, child care facilities\nNew History Colorado exhibit will honor victims of United Flight 629 bombing\nDenver7 is committed to making a difference in our community by standing up for what's right, listening, lending a helping hand and following through on promises.
