  "text": "Aamir Khan is known to play every on-screen role with perfection. However, the toughest role of his life is unfolding right now, as he is gearing up for the wedding of his dotting daughter Ira Khan. Usually, they say that a father gives away his daughter at a wedding, but for Aamir, it is more like welcoming a son to his family.During one of his old interviews with Hindustan Times, Aamir Khan opened up about his views on his soon-to-be son-in-law Nupur Shikhare. Even at the risk of sounding filmy, he confessed that he feels Nupur is like a son to him. 106328803He called him a lovely boy and said he had become already a part of the family. Aamir mentioned that Nupur stood by Ira on occasion when she needed him the most. He helped her battle depression and handled her with utmost love and care. Further, Aamir felt emotional while pouring his heart out on the subject of Ira and Nupur. He admitted that he is a sentimental person and it would be hard for him to hold back his tears on the wedding day. The family is already concerned as to who will be handling Aamir. 106313271Ira Khan and Nupur Shikhare are going to tie the knot in a traditional Marathi style on January 3, 2024. Reports suggest that the wedding will be a star-studded affair, but even those who would not be able to make it to the special day on January 3, will be showering their blessings on the couple at the reception. Interestingly, there will be two grand receptions, one will be held in Delhi and the other in Jaipur, reportedly on January 6 and 10 respectively.",
