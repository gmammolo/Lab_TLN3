  "text": "This is branded content for the Cancer Council and the Australian Government Six months ago, Newcastle builder Paul Smart experienced the unnerving wait to find out if a skin cancer growing on his neck was a melanoma. The 43-year-old father of three young children said the period between having a biopsy taken and getting the result was a \"scary\" time. \"When you hear those words from the doctor, &apos;This doesn&apos;t look great&apos;, you really start to think, well, what if it&apos;s something that&apos;s bad,\" he said. \"It was the first time it had happened to me and it was a shock.\" Fortunately, the news was good for the owner of Smartview Building and his family. But the five-centimetre football-shaped scar behind his ear where the cancer was removed now serves as a small reminder of the reality of skin cancer and the importance of being vigilant about sun protection. \"It was a real reality check,\" said Mr Smart, who started in his career as a 17-year-old. \"Despite having pretty good habits around sun protection it was a reminder not to get complacent. Since I was a kid I&apos;ve been aware of the dangers of skin cancer and we made sure we wore the sunscreen and hats, so it was a surprise. But growing up [in Newcastle and Lake Macquarie] I spent a lot of time outdoors, playing sport and at the beach. And I&apos;ve worked outside a lot on site because of what I do.\" As one of the most at-risk groups when it comes to skin cancer, tradies are a key target of the latest national skin cancer prevention campaign from the Cancer Council and the Australian Government. Australian men in general are more than twice as likely as women to die of melanoma, but tradies are especially vulnerable because of the nature of their work. Across all Australian men, research shows that while they spend more time outdoors than women at peak UV times they are significantly less likely to be in the habit of protecting their skin from the sun. This in a country that leads the world when it comes to the rate of skin cancer. In 2024 there were an estimated 18,964 cases of melanoma of the skin and 1664 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosed, with more than one million non-melanoma skin cancers treated. Around 1384 people lost their lives to melanoma. Up to 95 per cent of melanomas are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation - the invisible killer that you can&apos;t feel or see. UV can be high even on cool and overcast days. Spending time outdoors unprotected when the UV radiation is three or above increases the risk of developing the potentially deadly cancer. Cancer Council Australia Chief Executive Officer Mark Nevin urged all men and particularly outdoor workers like tradies to follow the Cancer Council&apos;s guidelines and get into the habit of protecting themselves daily from this almost entirely preventable disease. Up to 80 per cent of skin cancers are preventable by using the Cancer Council&apos;s five Sunsmart steps - Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek and Slide. \"Tradies take safety seriously on site, but we know sun protection often isn&apos;t a priority,\" Mr Nevin said. \"Two in three of us will be diagnosed with skin cancer in our lifetime, and people who work outdoors are at even greater risk, with Australian men twice as likely to die from melanoma than women. \"The good news is it can be prevented, and you can reduce your risk of skin cancer at any age, by following the steps. It only takes a few minutes to slip on protective clothing, slop on SPF50 or SPF50+ water-resistant sunscreen, slap on a broad-brimmed hat, seek shade, and slide on sunglasses. \"These small behaviours can protect your skin from UV and prevent skin cancer, no matter the season.\" While the commitments of managing his business means he&apos;s no longer putting the tool belt on as often, Mr Smart is a champion of sun protection for both himself and the Smartview team. \"For me, it&apos;s just good habits that are ingrained now,\" he said. \"If I&apos;m going out in the sun and don&apos;t put sunscreen on, or a hat on, I&apos;m going to get burned and I don&apos;t want to have to deal with that now or further down the track. It&apos;s pretty easy to remember the hat because I&apos;ve got a bald head. \"I make sure to remind the guys to use sunscreen, put their hats on and keep their shirts on. I&apos;d say 90 per cent of them are good at doing it but some of the younger ones are not so good. \"They haven&apos;t built those habits yet. You do feel bulletproof when you&apos;re young.\" n estimated 200 melanomas and 34,000 other skin cancers diagnosed each year in Australia are the result of UV damage in the workplace. If you spend a lot of time outdoors it&apos;s crucial to protect your skin from the sun all year round, regardless of UV levels - even on cloudy days. To keep your skin safe from this potentially deadly cancer incorporate these five easy habits into your daily routine. Long pants and work shirts with a collar and long sleeves are best. If possible, choose clothes made from lightweight, closely woven fabrics with a UV protection factor (UPF) 50+. Apply sunscreen generously 20 minutes before you start working outdoors. Reapply every two hours, or more often if sweating or working with water to ensure your skin is protected throughout the day. To remember try setting reminders on your phone. A hat is essential if you&apos;re heading outside. Choose a broad-brimmed, legionnaire or bucket-style hat that covers your face, neck and ears. These are common spots for skin cancers to develop and can easily be forgotten. Caps are not recommended as they don&apos;t provide full protection for the face, ears and neck. Leave a suitable hat in your car or by your door so you&apos;re always prepared. Work and take breaks in the shade. Whenever possible, plan to work indoors or in the shade during the middle of the day when UV radiation levels are strongest. Remember, UV rays can reflect from surfaces, especially if you&apos;re near water, so combine shade with other protection measures. Protect your eyes from the sun when working outdoors by wearing close-fitting wrap-around sunglasses or tinted safety glasses that offer UV protection. A good pair of sunglasses, when worn with a broad-brimmed hat, can block up to 98 per cent of UV radiation from reaching your eyes. Keep a pair in your glove box or bag you use everyday so they&apos;re always nearby. The Cancer Council and the Australian Government are reminding Australians to be sun safe by using all five forms of sun protection when the UV is three or above.
