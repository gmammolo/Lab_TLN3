  "text": "Weekly protests outside Health Minister Adriana LaGrange's Red Deer office will continue \"as long as it takes\" to properly investigate alleged government interference in to the health procurement process, says Public Interest Alberta.\nOn Wednesday, Premier Danielle Smith rejected the idea of an independent public inquiry into allegations in a lawsuit filed by the former head of Alberta Health Services Athana Mentzelopoulos that she was wrongfully dismissed from her job for looking into questionable contracts.\nThe statement of claim alleges she was pressured by government officials to sign off on contracts with surgical facilities at unjustified, inflated prices, potentially leading to hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for private clinic owners.\nThe government recently announced it would oversee an internal AHS review, helped by an unnamed third party. Alberta’s auditor general Doug Wylie is also investigating contracting procedures at AHS and the health ministry.\nSmith said she continues to have confidence in LaGrange as health minister despite calls for her resignation, and that a \"legal conflicts wall\" was being set up to separate the ongoing work of those named in the allegations, including LaGrange.\nSmith also spoke about the need to hold AHS to account.\nLaGrange repeated that she believes some claims in the lawsuit are false, while others warrant further investigation.\n“We will be filing our statement of defence in the coming weeks and will be vigorously — and I mean vigorously — defending against this claim,” LaGrange told the news conference.\nShe has said the dismissal of Mentzelopoulos was not linked to the former CEO’s investigation and that the ministry was being stonewalled by AHS for months in its attempt to find evidence of misconduct.\n“I firmly believe that concerns related to the procurement processes must be reviewed and investigated thoroughly to identify any potential wrongdoing or procurement process deficiencies,” LaGrange said.\nExecutive director Brad Lafortune said the premier's comments didn't increase Albertans' trust in the government to find out what is really going on.\n\"The allegations that have come out are about UCP government interference, including her senior most political staffer at the time. So this isn't about AHS dragging their heels, as she said, on improving the health care system. This is about allegations of political interference and corruption and pursuing a privatization agenda in surgeries no matter the cost to the taxpayer,\" Lafortune said.\nHe would like Smith to release all of the contracts under the Alberta Surgical Initiative, annual reports from the private facilities, whether they are meeting their surgery targets, how much those surgeries cost, and if wait times are indeed being reduced.\n\"I don't think she understands the gravity and magnitude of just how upset Albertans are.\"\nThe premier's comments have surely enraged Albertans even more. The third consecutive Saturday rally in Red Deer will be held \"same time, same place,\" Lafortune added.\nThe protest is scheduled for Feb. 22, from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m.\n— with files from The Canadian Press",
