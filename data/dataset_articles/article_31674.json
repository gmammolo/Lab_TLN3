  "text": "A brand of frozen chicken nuggets is under recall across Canada after pieces of bone led to reports of injuries. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced the recall on February 20, 2025, noting, \"The affected product is being recalled from the marketplace due to possible presence of pieces of bone.\" This situation has emerged following multiple consumer complaints about injuries caused by consuming these nuggets.\nThe product involved is Swiss Chalet's frozen chicken breast nuggets, distributed nationwide, and sold in 700-gram boxes. The specific Universal Product Code (UPC) is 066701011479, with best-before dates of September 7, 2025, and September 26, 2025. Images on the packaging reveal nuggets shaped like moons, stars, and planets, making them particularly appealing to children.\nThe CFIA did not specify how many units are affected or details of the reported injuries, only indicating, \"There have been reported injuries associated with the consumption of this product.\" This recall, categorized as Class 2, means there’s a moderate risk of short-term health issues if the product is consumed.\nConsumers are advised to immediately check their freezers for the affected chicken nuggets and to refrain from consuming, serving, or distributing the product. The CFIA states, \"Do not consume, serve, use, sell, or distribute recalled products.\" Anyone who discovers they possess the recalled item should dispose of it or return it to the point of purchase for a refund.\nThe agency is currently conducting a food safety investigation, which could lead to the recall of additional products. \"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products,\" they stated, confirming their commitment to ensuring public safety.\nOlymel, the producer of Swiss Chalet-branded products, has multiple facilities across New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta. The company employs around 12,000 people across its plants, offices, and distribution centers. Its commitment to food safety is being tested as it grapples with this significant recall.\nFor the public's safety, it's recommended to stay informed about potential future recalls and to monitor the CFIA's updates as the investigation progresses. People who have consumed the product and experienced any health issues are urged to contact their healthcare providers.\nIf consumers need more information about the recall, they can reach out to the CFIA via their toll-free number, 1-800-442-2342, or through email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Staying vigilant about food safety is key for protecting families from potentially harmful products.",
