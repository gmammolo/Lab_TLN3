  "text": "A 21-year-old harbor seal at Buttonwood Park Zoo in New Bedford, named Blue, died last week from highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as avian flu or bird flu.\nDiagnostic testing on Blue showed that he died from complications from the virus, which was likely contracted through contact with an infected wild bird, the zoo said in a statement released Wednesday.\nThere’s no risk to zoo visitors and any of the other seals in Blue’s habitat, Conway and Luna, the zoo stated. Both seals remain in good health.\n\"They were separated from Blue as soon as symptoms appeared, and BPZOO had already taken proactive steps to reduce the risk of HPAI, including removing public duck feeders and relocating vulnerable species in areas behind the scenes,\" the statement read.\nThe virus continues to affect wild and domesticated animal populations, including at zoos across the country, \"so the recent event at BPZOO is, regrettably, far from unique,\" zoo officials said.\n“Our veterinary and animal care teams continue to monitor all BPZOO residents closely, and our team is following strict protective protocols to prevent cross-contamination between species,” the statement concluded. “Thank you all for your patience, well wishes, and understanding.”\nBird flu has led to the deaths of several wild and domesticated animals over the past few months. In Massachusetts, the virus has caused the biggest outbreak seen in North America since 2021, Andrew Vitz, state ornithologist at MassWildlife, told MassLive in January.",
