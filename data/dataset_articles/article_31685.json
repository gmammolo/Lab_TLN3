  "text": "The risk assessment report for the John L. Neill youth baseball complex is in. Analysis of the soils beneath the three fields found several toxins, including arsenic, antimony, zinc and polychlorinated bicarbonates (PCBs). But the biggest concern, the company said, is the lead that was detected.\nThe report was released to the Enterprise yesterday at 4:08 PM.\nIn one of the fiends—Field 1, which is the northernmost field at the site—lead concentrations three times those deemed acceptable by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) were found within the first six inches of topsoil. DEP’s limit for lead is 200 parts per million; some soil samples taken from Field 1 found 600 ppm.\nThe fields, located off Gifford Street in Trotting Park, were built on top of an old town dump.\nIn September, the town was first alerted to potentially dangerous materials in the soil. In early January, the town closed the baseball complex after learning that the health threat was real.\n“This concentration of lead detected in topsoil on Field 1 could pose an unacceptable risk to young children if repeated contact with soil beneath the existing turf was allowed,” the report’s summary reads.\nThe testing company, Arcadis, recommended that Field 1 remain closed for use and that the town install a “geotextile membrane,” or fabric covering, over the field and cover that with two to three feet of soil before it can be safe for baseball again.\nContaminants, including lead, were also found in the topsoil of the other two fields, but to a lesser extent, the report states.\nSamples from Field 2 topped out at 190 ppm of lead, and Field 3 peaked at 45 ppm. That means two of the three baseball fields ”do not pose a risk to health for children contacting lead in topsoil on these fields,” the report states.\nBut deeper soil samples found much higher concentrations of contaminants beneath all three fields.\nBetween six inches and five feet deep in the soil, Field 2 exceeds state lead limits by 185 percent, and Field 3 by 25 percent.\nArcadis stated that while these deeper contaminants do not pose an immediate threat, they could be troublesome over the long-term.\nThe company said the town could allow play to resume on Fields 1 and 2 for the next year, as long as the topsoil is tested before play starts in the spring and periodically throughout the playing season. Next year, though, the town may have to look into adding more topsoil.\nBesides lead, other landfill waste materials—like glass—were also found on the walking paths, particularly between Fields 1 and 2. Those materials ”could pose a safety risk under current conditions and should be addressed to mitigate risks from physical hazards.”\nArcadis recommended the town temporarily cover the paths with another “geotextile material” and add a soil covering.\nThe report also states that there is no imminent hazard to the surrounding environment.\nThe full report is 80 pages long, though Arcadis wrote that the information is not necessarily final.\n“Additional investigation into the nature and extent of the landfill material underlying this area is ongoing and being managed in accordance with the [Massachusetts Contingency Plan],” the report states.\n“These investigation activities include a geophysical study and additional soil borings to determine the extent of the landfill, and groundwater assessment to determine groundwater flow direction and groundwater quality.”\nTown Manager Michael Renshaw was not immediately available for comment.\nThe select board is scheduled to discuss the report at its meeting Monday, February 24.",
