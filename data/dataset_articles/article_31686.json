  "text": "Egg prices reaching new highs as bird flu outbreak continues (Pexels | Pexels/MGN) By WEAU Staff Published: Feb. 20, 2025 at 5:47 PM CST | Updated: 30 minutes ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nEAU CLAIRE, Wis. (WEAU) - Egg prices are reaching new highs as a bird flu outbreak continues.\nThis is happening nationwide, leaving grocery stores and consumers scrambled.\nDemocratic Senator Tammy Baldwin spoke with WEAU about the outbreak, saying in Wisconsin alone, tens of thousands of farm birds have been impacted.\nBaldwin also says the Trump administration has no plan to help Wisconsin farmers and consumers. Adding cuts to federal spending is not helping matters, especially the recent USDA firings.\n“The USDA over the weekend fired many employees some of whom were on the front lines of fighting the avian flu outbreak now they’re scrambling to hire them back,” said Senator Baldwin.\nWe also reached out to Republican Congressman Derrick Van Orden about the issue.\n“The reason the avian flu has gone on for as long as it has is because the Biden administration ordered the slaughtering of millions of chickens instead of addressing the root cause of the problem. With the confirmation of Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, we will have clarity on USDA’s response and the steps they will take to protect both our food supply and poultry farmers. My priority remains making sure Wisconsin’s farmers have the tools they need to recover from this and continue feeding America.”\nCopyright 2025 WEAU.
