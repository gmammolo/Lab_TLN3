  "text": "Rep. Chip Roy Bill Would Take Away Coronavirus Shots Manufacturers' Liability Shield\nAdam Dick\nRON PAUL INSTITUTE\nThat situation could change. A bill reintroduced on Tuesday by Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) would tear away that special shield from liability so people harmed by the shots can receive compensation.\nAmong its provisions, Roy's Let Injured Americans Be Legally Empowered Act (the LIABLE Act) (HR 1432) states that \"[n]o Federal law … may make the manufacturer of a COVID–19 vaccine immune from suit or liability, or limit the liability of such a manufacturer, with respect to claims for loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the administration to or the use by an individual of a COVID–19 vaccine.\" The bill further provides that its provisions, including this removal of protection from liability, apply retroactively to shots already administered, as well as to shots that may be administered after the bill is enacted.\nRead here a Wednesday Breitbart article by Bradley Jaye that discusses the bill's introduction as well as some of the special liability restrictions in US law that have blocked compensation for injuries and deaths caused by coronavirus shots.",
