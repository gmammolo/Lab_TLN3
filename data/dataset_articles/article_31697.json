  "text": "Melissa felt something was off. A vague discomfort she couldn’t explain. She brushed the discomfort aside, hoping sleep would help. It didn’t. As the discomfort lingered, she finally decided to call for help—just in case. By the time paramedics arrived, she was unresponsive. It was too late. Her heart had been sending warnings, but Melissa didn’t trust herself enough to listen.\nSadly, Melissa’s story is far too common.\nOver 60 million women in the United States are living with heart disease right now —many without even knowing it. Heart disease doesn’t always cause a scene— a dramatic collapse or chest-clutching moment. It usually whispers. But when it strikes, the consequences can be deadly.\nUnseen, Unheard, Undiagnosed\nHeart disease is a silent alarm for many women, especially Black women—one that’s often easy to ignore. Not because they don’t care, but because life is loud. The noise of responsibilities, the unspoken expectation to be strong, and the weight of being a caregiver—rarely receiving care in return—can easily overshadow the necessity to be well.\n“When women take care of their health, they become their own best friend.” —Maya Angelou\nThese words aren’t just poetry—they’re a call to action in a world where Black women’s health is often overlooked.\nSixty percent. That’s how many Black women ages 20 and older who have a cardiovascular disease. Now, take a moment—pause—and think about this. Sixty percent. That’s one in six Black women, so it could be your sister, your best friend. Maybe even you.\nFor Black women, the burden of heart disease is not just physical, but emotional — rooted in historical deep-seated mistrust of the healthcare system that hasn’t always had Black women’s best interests at heart. It’s about the fight to be seen , to be heard , and to receive the care that has long been denied.\nKnow the Symptoms, and Trust Your Instincts\nHeart disease is easily missed—until it is impossible to ignore . In women, its warnings are often brushed aside —mistaken for stress, menopause, or just another busy day. Under-diagnosed and under-treated, heart disease claims the lives of one in three women in the United States each year. Awareness changes outcomes. Action saves lives.\nSmall symptoms can be BIG red flags—learning to spot them could save your life. You just need to know what they are.\nWhich of these could signal a heart attack in a woman?\nFatigue even after a good night’s sleep Discomfort in the chest, upper back, or jaw Nausea, vomiting, or flu-like symptoms Lightheadedness or dizziness Feelings of anxiety Shortness of breath All of them. These symptoms aren’t random—they’re a cry for help. When blood flow to your heart is limited, it can cause pain in the chest, back, or jaw. But it doesn’t stop there. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness, flu-like symptoms are signs that your heart is struggling for oxygen. Anxiety often follows as your body fights to keep up. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Trust your instincts. Call 911—don’t wait to see if it passes.\nRecognize the Hidden Threats to Her Heart\nIgnored symptoms can lead to the real danger, often in the form of a subtle buildup—the quiet things that go unnoticed until they chip away at our heart health, such as:\nHigh blood pressure strains the heart, forcing it to work harder. Diabetes damages blood vessels, making heart disease two to four times more likely . High cholesterol clogs arteries, setting the stage for a heart attack. Unchecked, these threats weaken the heart. But the good news? Heart disease is largely preventable— if we recognize the risks and take action early.\nWomen’s Heart Health: Separate Fact from Fiction\nHeart disease is often misunderstood—wrapped in myths that give women a false sense of security and leave them vulnerable. It is time to uncover the truth:\nMyth #1: Heart disease is a man’ s problem.\nTruth: Being a woman doesn’t grant immunity to heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, taking more lives than all cancers combined .\nMyth #2: I’m too young to worry about heart disease.\nTruth: Heart disease doesn’t discriminate by age. Risk factors like stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, and even birth control pills can affect younger women.\nMyth #3: If I exercise and eat healthy, I’m not at risk.\nTruth: Genetics, stress, and hormonal changes—like during pregnancy or menopause—also impact heart health.\nMyth #4: Heart attacks always come with chest pain.\nTruth: Women’s heart attack symptoms can feel more like extreme fatigue, nausea, or back pain rather than the crushing chest pain typically associated with men.\nMyth #5: Taking care of my family is more important than taking care of myself.\nTruth: You can’t pour from an empty cup. Taking care of your heart means you’ll be healthier, not just for yourself, but for your loved ones too.\nThe power to protect your heart starts with knowledge—and is strengthened by the actions you take.\nHeart-Healthy Prescription s\nHeart health isn’t a one-time fix; it’s a daily commitment to your well-being. These habits can add years to your life and life to your years:\nKnow Your Numbers. When was the last time you had your blood pressure or cholesterol checked? Make an annual appointment with your healthcare provider to stay ahead of potential risks. Move More. Your heart loves movement. Even a 10-minute walk is a step toward a healthier you. Stress Less . Breathe deeply. Meditate. Journal. Practice yoga. Or whatever takes the edge off of life—your peace is your superpower! Your heart is 73% water—keep it strong by drinking plenty of non-caffeinated, low-sugar fluids. Fuel Wisely. Choose heart-friendly foods—lean proteins, whole grains, and colorful veggies. Sleep Tight. Don’t shortchange your heart. Prioritize seven to nine hours of sleep nightly. Limit Women who drink should limit their alcohol to one drink per day. Quit Smoking . Smoking harms blood vessels and oxygen flow to the heart. It’s never too late to quit. Most importantly, be your own advocate —if something feels wrong, speak up and insist on further testing. You life depends on it.\nGuard Your Heart\nHeart disease continues to be one of the biggest threats to women’s health—but it doesn’t have to be. With proactive awareness, early intervention, and daily heart-healthy decisions, women are empowered to guard their hearts and honor their health.\nBIO\nDr. Bernadette is a respected authority and powerful voice in health and wellness.
