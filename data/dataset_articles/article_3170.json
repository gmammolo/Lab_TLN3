  "text": "News\nSokoto governor signs bill establishing Community Guards Corps\nSokoto State Governor, Ahmed Aliyu, on Thursday signed a bill establishing the Community Guards Corps in the state.\nThe governor described the bill as a significant milestone in his administration’s efforts to guarantee the security and development of the state.\n”The effort was delivered to address incidents of kidnappings, banditry and other forms of criminality facing the state.\n”It was part of the commitment to curtail the menace and engage collaboratively with neighboring states in the fight against insecurity,” Aliyu said.\nThe governor expressed gratitude to the State House of Assembly members for their support in realising the initiative.\nHe stressed that the establishment of the Corps was also aimed at providing a collaborative mechanism with statutory security agencies to provide support in maintaining a safe and livable environment for all citizens.\nAccording to him, the purpose of setting up the Corps was not to pose challenges to security agencies but to improve their efforts in identifying societal threats and providing crucial information.",
