  "text": "Daniel Dubois was scheduled to defend title against Joseph Parker on Saturday However, the IBF heavyweight champion reported himself unwell on Thursday A replacement bout for Parker has been scheduled on just 48 hours notice By JEFF POWELL and JAMES COHEN\nPublished: 19:47 GMT, 20 February 2025 | Updated: 20:03 GMT, 20 February 2025\nIBF heavyweight world champion Daniel Dubois has pulled out of his highly-anticipated title fight with Joseph Parker after being struck down by illness.\nHe was examined by a doctor in Riyadh on Thursday after reporting himself unwell before he was due to take part in the final press conference before the huge event.\nThis came less than a day after he pronounced himself ‘absolutely’ ready to go against New Zealand’s former world champion.\nThe ultimate prize of a fight against Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed heavyweight title was on the line for the winner.\nPromoter Frank Warren began an immediate search for a late replacement to face Parker in what would be a non-title fight.\nIt’s now been confirmed that Parker will face Congolese boxer Martin Bakole in a heavyweight clash – with the latter taking the fight on just 48 hours notice.\nDaniel Dubois has had to pull out of Saturday’s world title fight after coming down with illness\nDubois was scheduled to defend his IBF world heavyweight title against Joseph Parker (right)\nLawrence Okolie, David Adeleye and Mourad Aliev are among the options being considered, according to Ring Magazine.\nThe rematch between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol had already been designated as the main event on a huge card with Dubois v Parker as the co-feature.\nThe fight in Saudi Arabia was a match-up between two of the world’s most in-form heavyweights.\nIt was supposed to be Dubois’ second title defence, his first coming when he shocked Anthony Joshua at Wembley back in September.\nHe dropped former two-time unified heavyweight champion four times before rendering him unconscious in the fifth round.\nDubois was an odds-on favourite to successfully defend his belt yet again on Saturday.\nThe cancellation of the IBF heavyweight title fight comes just days after another title fight on the Beterbiev vs Bivol card.\nParker will face Congolese boxer Martin Bakole in a heavyweight clash on Saturday evening\nIt was revealed earlier in the week that Shakur Stevenson’s world title fight bout against Floyd Schofield has been called off.\nSchofield, 22, had initially showed up to Saudi Arabia and did his media duties on Monday but then vanished on Tuesday and wasn’t seen at the grand arrivals.\nAs a result, Josh Padley – a part-time electrician from Doncaster – has stepped up to face American Shakur in Riyadh on Saturday.\nThe part-time sparky from Yorkshire was not supposed to be in the ring this weekend, but he has jumped at the opportunity to fight on the big stage following a late withdrawal in Riyadh.\n:\nDaniel Dubois vs Joseph Parker is OFF! Brit is forced to pull out after coming down with illness – as late replacement is confirmed for Beterbiev v Bivol card\n***\nRead more at DailyMail.co.uk",
