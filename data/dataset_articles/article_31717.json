  "text": "Opioid-fighting windfall sitting unspent in Massachusetts municipal coffers\nUse it or lose it. That's the message from one state lawmaker to cities and towns across the state over their sitting on more than $80 million in money given to them to fight opioid addiction.\n\"You've had more than ample time to do this. Get this money out the door. People are dying,\" said state Sen. John Velis, D-Westfield. \"I fundamentally do not understand why municipalities are slow rolling this the way that they are.\"\nVelis, himself in recovery, has served as Senate chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery. He said if cities and towns don't start spending the money, the state should consider taking the money back.\n\"We know the gold standard. Get Narcan out there. Focus on harm reduction, focus on prevention,\" he said. \"We are getting dangerously close to the point where I would say that if that money isn't going to get out there, is it time to set deadlines? And if deadlines aren't met, to kind of bring that money back, almost some type of a clawback provision.\"\nThe money comes from the state's share of the national opioid settlement fund, a landmark deal with opioid manufacturers, distributors and retailers to settle lawsuits in exchange for payments over time.\nMassachusetts is set to receive $1 billion over 18 years, with 60% going to the state to spend and the rest mostly going to cities and towns, with the requirement that the money be spent on things like prevention, harm reduction, treatment and recovery.\nIn the last two years, Massachusetts cities and towns have received $91 million in opioid settlement funds but spent just $6.7 million, according to the state Department of Public Health. That's just 7%of the money in hand, with more on the way.\nIn all, 135 communities had not used any of the opioid settlement money they received, according to state data analyzed by 5 Investigates. And the vast majority of cities and towns spent less than 10% of the money.\nIn the two years since the money began flowing, at least an estimated 4,000 people have died in Massachusetts from opioid-related overdoses.\nSee how much opioid settlement money your city and town has received and spent so far.\nThe city of Lynn received $1.5 million in opioid settlement funds in the first two years of the program, the beginning of what's expected to be about $6 million in all over the next 13 years.\nIt has paid for a community wellness vending machine that gives 24-hour access to everything from sexual health supplies to wound care kits. It has funded naloxone, the drug that can reverse overdoses, and sharps containers for used needles.\nBut the city has only spent about $120,000 of what it has on hand. While deaths are down, 45 people from Lynn died from overdoses in 2023, the ninth hardest-hit community in the state.\nCandice McClory, the city's substance use coordinator, defended the pace of spending.\n\"It's really important for us to make sure that we're not spending down to the dollar. We don't know what funding will look like in the future,\" she said. \"I feel like we, as the city of Lynn are doing exactly what we're supposed to be doing. We have spent a lot more money than other cities.\"\nBoston, with the highest number of fatal overdoses, also is set to receive the most money: $39 million through 2038. So far, the city has received $12 million but only spent $525,880 as of Feb. 7.\nBoston Public Health Commission executive director Dr. Bisola Ojikutu said all of Boston's $12 million has been allocated, but the city did not provide a detailed breakdown of where the money's going.\n\"Obviously this crisis is not going away, so we're not spending the money as one lump sum. Instead, we're spending this money that we have currently that's been allocated over the course of the next four years,\" she said.\nVideo: Boston has the highest number of fatal overdoses in Massachusetts\nAcross the river in Cambridge, 31 people died from opioid-related overdoses in 2023. It's only spent 4% — $170,325 — of the $4.6 million received so far in opioid settlement funds. It's receiving $16.2 million in all.\nThat money paid for a medical outreach van, run by CASPAR, the Cambridge And Somerville Programs for Addiction Recovery, to meet people in the community.\n\"They stay outside, they don't deal with the problem. And so bringing it to them and also being able to see the actual situation in the van with the right lighting has been huge,\" said Alexis Grandberg, director of the First Step Outreach program\nThe city said it will spend about $600,000 a year for the van's operations and it is still evaluating how to spend the rest of the money.\nAdam Chapdelaine, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, said city and town leaders want to be responsive to the opioid crisis. Some of the delays at first were caused by a technical difficulty that cities and towns had accessing the funds.\n\"It certainly could display a lack of urgency, but I have a confidence that the communities are trying to plan for the best use of those funds,\" he said.\nThe Mass. Department of Public Health initially refused to release detailed, municipal-level data to 5 Investigates, only doing so after we appealed to the Secretary of State's office.\nThat data shows that just four Massachusetts cities have spent all of the money. One of those is the central Massachusetts city of Gardner.\n\"It was one of those things that once we had an idea in place, it was pretty easy to put all the puzzle pieces together. It took us about a week,\" said Gardner Mayor Michael Nicholson.\nGardner partnered with neighboring communities to fund a recovery support navigator who responds after an overdose.\n\"They'll do an assessment with the individual or the family, whatever it may be, and really get a feel for what kind of need that person has,\" explained Shawn Hayden, president of GAAMHA, a human services provider in Gardner, which received the opioid settlement money to pay for the shared clinician.\nHayden understands first-hand how resources can make a difference. He started at GAAMHA as a client.\n\"My introduction to opioids started with a back injury and a well-intentioned family practitioner and a prescription,\" he said.\nThat prescription launched him on the path to addiction. He ended up in and out of jail.\n\"My own life had become a mess through my own struggle with opioids. And in 2009, I was homeless and pretty helpless,\" he said.\nHis message: recovery is possible, and the opioid settlement funds can help.\n\"Are you surprised to hear that some communities are having trouble apparently spending this money?\" 5 Investigates' Mike Beaudet asked.\n\" I don't know if I'm surprised, disappointed. I think,\" he said.",
