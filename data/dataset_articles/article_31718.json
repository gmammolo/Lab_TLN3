  "text": "“My Eczema Was So Severe I Had to Leave Australia!”\nWritten by Faye Haines\nI’ve suffered from chronic debilitating eczema since I was about six-months-old.\nThe Australian climate has always been an issue, and I was allergic to everything including dust mites, makeup, fragrance, fabrics, plastics, food and textiles – even peeling fruit would blister my skin.\nI was covered from head to toe in eczema – intensely itchy, my skin sore, cracked, burning, peeling, oozing and I couldn’t stop scratching, resulting in weeping open sores.\nMy clothes and bedsheets were always covered in blood, and I was vacuuming huge amounts of skin flakes off the floor. During really bad flares, I’d lose my eyebrows and shed so much skin it looked like snow.\nThere are seven different types of eczema, and I have a combination of four different types. I also have a defective skin barrier which means I can’t keep the moisture in, or irritants out. It became all-consuming for me.\nI can’t shower or swim or exercise during a bad flare and could never go to the beach or show my body off.\nI was hospitalised more than 20 times but whenever I left Australia, I found my skin improved. In my 20’s, my doctor advised me that unless I wanted to live in and out of hospital and wear head to toe wet dressings every day, I should seriously think of moving to another country that my skin could tolerate.\nI moved to the UK and initially, my skin seemed to love the wet UK climate, but it eventually started to react. I was in Prague when Covid-19 hit and had to isolate but spent most of my time there swathed in bandages. My husband did everything outside the home, looked after me, took our son out and then worked at night until the early hours.\nWe went to Greece, and little things that are no big deal for most people were miraculous for me there. My skin started to heal, and I could shower, go swimming, wear shorts, and even wash my hair standing up instead of my husband having to wash it over the sink.\nOf course, I really missed my family, and when my skin started to heal after trying MooGoo products, I wondered if I could come home. I’d also heard about Dupixent, a new ‘biologic’ treatment for severe eczema that was helping people like me.\nIt’s an injection every two weeks, but I was determined to give it a go.\nI moved home last year, started on Dupixent, and upped my routine with MooGoo products. It’s an Australian natural skincare brand and the transformation has been incredible.\nMy skin is now perfect. It’s a bloody miracle and still can’t believe it. Dupixent, teamed with the Udder Cream and Amplified Anti-Ageing Peptide has made my skin so clear and soft.\nIt’s insane the basic things I can do now; shower, walk in the park, go for a swim – they were off limits before. I’ve been at the beach all summer, jumping in the ocean, and have even started exercising. I’m falling in love with Australia all over again.\nMelody Livingstone, CEO of Gold Coast-based MooGoo, says the business has seen a huge spike of enquiries from people over the last few weeks asking how to keep their flaring skin conditions under control.\n“While data shows eczema has a strong genetic link, it is often flared by environmental factors, and the intense weather swings can cause significant discomfort,” she says.\n“Recognising this link is key to managing flare-ups effectively.”\nMelody’s Tips for Managing Skin Issues in Australia’s Crazy Climate\nRead the Ingredients Label\nIngredients matter. Look for natural, gentle, and nourishing ingredients that provide hydration without causing irritation. We formulate our moisturisers with ingredients known for their soothing and moisturising properties including Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil, Olive Squalane, Chamomile Extract, Allantoin, and Calendula.\nAvoid Harsh Chemicals\nUnfortunately, a lot of skincare products contain harsh ingredients which can aggravate sensitive skin and exacerbate existing skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. Opt for moisturisers that are free from common irritants such as parabens, sulphates, phenoxyethanol, and petroleum jellies.\nConsider Specific Concerns\nDifferent skin concerns require different solutions. If you’re dealing with eczema or psoriasis, look for moisturisers specifically formulated to address these conditions and help relieve itching and inflammation and if you have dry skin pick a richer one.\nSensitive skin – If you prefer a lighter texture, pick skin-loving ingredients such as with Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) which can strengthen the skin barrier.\nRed inflamed skin – creams and lotions with MSM and Aloe Vera can help calm irritated skin. MSM, also known as Organic Sulphur, is a natural compound that is known for soothing skin.\nDamaged skin – creams with ceramides that can offer hydration and help repair damaged skin barriers. Ceramides are essential lipids found in healthy skin and can help provide relief and create a protective barrier to prevent skin irritation.\nAnxious or having trouble sleeping? Look for one that contains magnesium chloride to aid in relaxation and help soothe certain skin concerns.\nTan safely!\nSunscreen, wide hats, shade and lots of water are a must. If you need an added boost, fake it ‘til you make it! Some tanning agents can cause further irritation, so look for soothing natural tanning agents. Skin-friendly ingredients include DHA and erythrulose, mixed with sweet almond, olive squalane, coconut oil, Vitamin E and purified EGCG Green Tea Leaf Extract, a powerful antioxidant that helps improve the skin barrier.\nKnow Your Skin Type – and if you don’t, take the MooGoo skincare quiz.\nAbout MooGoo\nMooGoo is a range of natural and gentle products for babies and people with sensitive, easily irritated skin. MooGoo started out in CEO Craig Jones’s home, when he was searching for something to help his mother, who suffers from dermatitis and psoriasis. As the only cream that had worked for his mum was a cream used on dairy cows, he decided to come up with his own version and whipped up a natural cream in his kitchen. His Skin Milk ‘Udder Cream‘ cleared up his mother’s skin condition and he was inundated with friends and family wanting it too. MooGoo now sells an eczema and psoriasis cream every one minute and 45 seconds. The rest is history!",
