  "text": "February 20, 2025 Contact Information John Senn ( Senn.John@epa.gov ) (857) 329-2447 R1 Press Office ( R1_Press@epa.gov ) BOSTON (February 20, 2025) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced a settlement with Dwight RE, LLC that includes $41,322 in a civil penalty and actions that will help protect residents of their properties in New Haven, Conn., from lead paint exposure risks in the future.\nUnder the settlement, the company will come into and maintain compliance with federal lead paint disclosure regulations. Dwight RE will also revise its online leasing practices so that its tenants sign and date lead disclosure forms, as required by law. Before EPA's enforcement action, tenants were signing leases, but not the disclosure forms.\nIn August 2023, an EPA representative inspected Dwight RE to determine its compliance with federal lead paint disclosure regulations. Dwight RE manages 13 properties in New Haven, all of which were built before 1978. Residential buildings built before 1978 are defined as \"target housing\" under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as they may contain lead paint.\nEPA found that Dwight RE failed to provide tenants in eight apartments with an EPA-approved lead hazard information pamphlet prior to the tenants becoming obligated to lease the apartment, failed to provide in or attached to the lease contract a statement disclosing the presence of known lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards and a list of any records or reports pertaining to lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards, as required by law. EPA determined during its investigation that no children lived in the apartments where the alleged violations occurred.\nThe single largest cause of childhood lead poisoning is from exposure to lead from deteriorated or disturbed lead paint. Nearly 30% of homes in the United States, mostly those built before 1978, have lead-based paint. Millions of people continue to be exposed to lead in their homes, childcare facilities, and in other buildings where lead-based paint is in deteriorating conditions (peeling, chipping, cracking, or damaged).\nBackground: Under the federal Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act and TSCA, EPA inspects worksites and records of renovation firms, abatement firms, property managers, landlords, and real estate agents for compliance with lead-related environmental laws and regulations.\nRead more about EPA's work to enforce lead laws and regulations.\nRead more about real estate disclosures about potential lead hazards.",
