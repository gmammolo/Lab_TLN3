  "text": "Councillor Anthony Wint\nBy Racquel Porter\nJoong Supermarket on Newlands Road in Portmore, St. Catherine has been ordered closed by the South East Regional Health Authority due to non-compliance with the Public Health (Food Handling) Regulations.\nIn a letter dated February 19, St. Catherine's Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Francia Prosper-Chen, said the closure will remain in effect until further notice.\nSpeaking at the St. Catherine Public Health and Sanitation meeting on Thursday, Councillor Anthony Wint raised concerns about the storage of garbage at the establishment.\n\"It's quite visible that where they keep the garbage at the front it breeds a lot of rodents and insects like roaches. And I'm just wondering if in your inspection those things were taken into consideration. I think it's too close to the building and that these insects and rodents can migrate from where the garbage heap is at the front to inside the building,\" Mr. Wint cautioned.",
