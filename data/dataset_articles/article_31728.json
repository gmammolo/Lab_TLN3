  "text": "One person was injured after a gas explosion occurred at a restaurant in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, officials said. The explosion occurred just after 3:40 p.m. at 232 Hall Avenue. Upon arrival, fire crews found the windows of the first-floor restaurant blown out, with smoke visible from inside. The gas line was reported to be damaged while work was being performed at the location. An active natural gas leak was also present. The gas has been turned off and Elizabethtown Gas remains on site working closely with emergency officials to ensure the area is safe. Fire officials say surrounding buildings were evacuated as a hose line was deployed to maintain the fire. Elizabethtown Gas was able to secure the gas main, allowing crews to enter the building and extinguish the flames. One person sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to an area hospital. One family from the third-floor apartment of the building will be relocated as a result of the incident. The cause of the fire and explosion are under investigation. Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover? Send it to Eyewitness News using the form below.
