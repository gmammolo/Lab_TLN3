  "text": "San Antonio Spurs superstar Victor Wembanyama is set to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 NBA season after suffering from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder.\nThe Spurs said in a statement that the condition was discovered when Wembanyama returned to San Antonio after the All-Star Game, which took place in San Francisco last weekend. The injury is a scary one for NBA fans and front offices following Chris Bosh's heartbreaking premature retirement due to blood clots.\nDVT is a form of a blood clot and typically occurs when a player does a movement repeatedly, putting pressure on a vein from the muscles around it. The Spurs believe it is an isolated issue for Wembanyama and expect him to return to full health for the 2025-26 NBA season.\nThe Spurs released a statement which read: “The San Antonio Spurs today announced that Victor Wembanyama has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. The condition was discovered when Wembanyama returned to San Antonio following the All-Star Game in San Francisco. Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season. The team will provide updates as appropriate.”\nWembanyama is the reigning Rookie of the Year and was named an All-Star for the first time in his exciting young career. Following a stellar rookie campaign, Wembanyama led France to the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nEntering his second season surrounded by remarkable hype, the Frenchman has averaged 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-leading 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs, who boast a 23-29 record. His combination with Chris Paul and the rest of the young Spurs team was helping the franchise develop an exciting future. The Spurs also made a blockbuster trade for De'Aaron Fox to combine him with Wembanyama going forward.\nUnfortunately, Wembanyama will not be eligible for All-NBA, Defensive Player of the Year and other major award because the 21-year-old did not meet the 65-game minimum threshold rule for award eligibility implemented ahead of last season. Wembanyama was enjoying a banner sophomore season and would have likely secured his first Defensive Player of the Year award thanks to his incredible production on both ends.\nToronto Raptors forward Brandon Ingram suffered from deep vein thrombosis in his right arm in March 2019, and bounced back to win Most Improved Player the very next season. Wembanyama - and the Spurs - will be desperate to replicate Ingram's recovery amid a scary situation.\nThe Spurs, without Wembanyama, are next in action against the 26-28 Phoenix Suns on Thursday, Feb. 20.",
