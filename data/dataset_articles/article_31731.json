  "text": "Cancer death rates ‘almost 60% higher in deprived areas’\nResearch by Cancer Research UK found that about 28,400 cancer deaths each year are associated with deprivation.\nStorm Newton\nCancer death rates are almost 60% higher for people living in the most deprived areas of the UK, according to new analysis.\nExperts from Cancer Research UK suggest this is down to people from poorer areas being diagnosed too late, and said improved access to the NHS is “vital”.\nPeople in deprived areas are also more likely to smoke, be obese, and are less likely to take part in cancer screening programmes, the report suggests.\nResearch by the charity found that about 28,400 cancer deaths each year are associated with deprivation.\nThis is the equivalent to 78 additional deaths a day, and more than three in 30 of all deaths from cancer.\n“These are excess cancer deaths which may have been avoided if the whole country had the same age- and sex-specific mortality rates as seen in the least deprived areas, within each UK nation,” the report added.\nAlmost half (47%) of these deaths are due to lung cancer, according to the analysis.\nIt found the proportion of people who smoke cigarettes – the single biggest risk factor of lung cancer – in deprived areas was 22%, compared with just 6% in wealthier areas.\nThe proportion of adults who were obese in deprived areas was 36%, compared with 19% in better-off areas.\nPeople in poorer areas are also more likely to be diagnosed late and wait longer for treatment, according to the report.\nThey are also less likely to take part in screening, Cancer Research UK said.\nOne example used in the report is the bowel screening programme, which allows patients to collect a stool sample at home before posting it back for testing.\nIt found there is a 57% uptake of the test in deprived areas, compared with 76% in wealthier areas.\nDr Ian Walker, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said: “Beating cancer must mean beating it for everybody.\n“No-one should be at a greater risk of dying from this devastating disease simply because of where they live.\n“These figures are shocking and unacceptable – but crucially, they’re avoidable.\n“People from more deprived areas are being diagnosed too late.\n“Improving access to NHS services through funding and innovation will be vital, so that those who seek help get the care they deserve.”\nKaris Betts, inequalities lead at Cancer Research UK, said: “To tackle cancer inequalities, our health services need to work together with communities themselves – to prevent the causes of cancer and spot the disease earlier.\n“Sustainably funding support to help people stop smoking will avoid so many cancer cases in deprived areas.\n“But we also need new and better ways to diagnose cancer at an early stage, like targeted lung screening, which is proven to help save lives in at-risk communities.\n“It’s vital that this is fully rolled out across England, followed by all four UK nations.”\nThe analysis comes after the Government launched a call for evidence to help shape a national cancer plan earlier this month.\nThe blueprint is expected to outline actions to transform how the disease is treated in a bid to reduce deaths.\nReacting to the report, Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England’s national clinical director for cancer, said: “NHS staff are working hard to ensure that everyone affected by cancer receives a prompt diagnosis and treatment, and initiatives such as our targeted lung check have been especially helpful for people in deprived areas who are at greater risk of cancer, so that if they have lung cancer it is now being diagnosed at a much earlier stage.\n“We recognise there is still much more to do to ensure that everyone receives a timely diagnosis and treatment, and are seeing record numbers come forward for urgent checks, with suspected cancer referrals more than doubling in the last decade, a narrowing of the gap between the most and least well-off, and cancer survival rates have never been higher.\n“The NHS is fully committed to improving access to cancer care and recently confirmed the Faster Diagnosis Standard target is to be increased, to see around 100,000 more patients receive a diagnosis or the all-clear within four weeks next year.”",
