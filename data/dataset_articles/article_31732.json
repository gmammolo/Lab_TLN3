  "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has sounded the alarm over a sharp rise in measles cases worldwide, reporting a 20% increase in infections in 2023 compared to the previous year.\nAccording to WHO, more than 10 million people contracted measles last year, with 107,500 deaths, mostly among children under five years old.\nThe surge is largely attributed to declining vaccination rates, leaving millions of children vulnerable to the highly contagious disease.\nMeasles spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes, making it one of the most easily transmitted diseases.\nWHO warns that if one person gets measles, nearly everyone around them who is unvaccinated will also be infected.\nDespite being preventable through immunization, measles remains a leading cause of child mortality globally.\nThe measles vaccine, administered in two doses, has been proven to provide lifelong protection, but coverage has declined in recent years due to disruptions in healthcare systems, vaccine hesitancy, and inadequate immunization programs in some regions.\nWHO and other health experts are urging governments and healthcare providers to intensify vaccination campaigns, particularly in high-risk communities, to prevent further outbreaks.\nEfforts to boost routine immunization programs and address misinformation about vaccines are seen as critical in reversing the trend.\nThe organization calls on parents, caregivers, and policymakers to prioritize measles vaccination to protect children and communities from severe complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and blindness.\nRead the original article on Nile Post .",
