  "text": "Consumers in multiple states are being urged to check their snack cabinets after a major recall affecting a popular brand of biscuits, wafers, and snack rolls. ZB Importing LLC is voluntarily recalling certain lots of six varieties of Ulker Brand snack products due to undeclared wheat, egg, and/or milk in the ingredient list and/or \"Contains\" statement on product labels. People with allergies or severe sensitivities to these ingredients could experience serious or life-threatening reactions if they consume the affected items. Affected Distribution Areas Products were distributed through retail stores in Ontario, Canada, and the following states: View Product Labels Here The issue was discovered after a consumer reported an allergic reaction linked to one of the recalled products. According to the company, the mislabeling originated from a supplier who failed to fully disclose all allergens during the translation of ingredient lists. In response, ZB Importing is implementing stricter labeling controls and an additional verification process for multilingual packaging. Anyone who purchased the affected Ulker Brand products is advised to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions can contact the company at info@ziyad.com.",
