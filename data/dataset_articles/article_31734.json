  "text": "Our Blood Institute in need of donors during emergency blood shortage\nARDMORE, Okla. (KXII) - As Texoma temperatures dropped, things seemed to screech to a halt, but the need for donating blood never freezes. Right now, Our Blood Institute, formerly Oklahoma Blood Institute, which services southern Oklahoma, is suffering an emergency blood shortage.\n“There is a sense of urgency, that’s why we’re in a blood emergency,” said Michelle McGuire, OBI Senior Account Manager. “A blood emergency means that we have a day supply of blood or less for the whole state, and that’s a very scary situation to be in... If we don’t see something turn around and we improve those collections, then that’s a recipe for disaster that we’re trying to avoid.”\nOBI has a daily unit mark they have to meet to help countless people get the blood they need just to survive, but currently, that is in jeopardy.\n“Cancer patients, accident victims, people that are having surgery, newborn babies on NICU up at children’s hospital, and then if something major happened, we wouldn’t be able to provide that supply that’s needed,” McGuire said.\nWith the importance of donating blood as critical as it is, people around the city of Ardmore are stepping up to help.\n“I know how important it is for each of us to donate and to do our civic duty is what I believe it is,” said Ardmore Assistant City Manager Kevin Norris.\n“At the end of the day, you’re saving three people when you donate blood, and it might be your next-door neighbor,” said McGuire. “It might be someone you pass on the road. You just never know who’s going to need those units.”\nIf you donate now, you’ll get a themed donor t-shirt too; a gift for being a superhero to those who need it.\nCopyright 2025 KXII.
