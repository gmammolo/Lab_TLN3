  "text": "Harris County Attorney Christian D. Menefee is supporting a lawsuit aimed at halting President Donald Trump's funding cuts to National Institutes of Health, which Menefee said could lead to job losses and \"major setbacks\" for researchers at Texas Medical Center. Menefee said in a Thursday news release that Harris County has joined 44 other local governments from across the country in support of a lawsuit filed against the NIH after it announced a 15% cap on grants designed to cover \"indirect costs\" — defined by the agency as expenses primarily related to facilities and administration. CUTBACKS: Baylor, MD Anderson among Houston research institutions that could lose millions under NIH grant policy “Once again, the Trump administration is playing politics with funding that our communities and economy rely on,” Menefee said. “This fight is about more than just dollar signs; it’s about the future of medical science and the ability of our local universities and hospitals to continue their life-saving research.” Although Harris County is not a direct party in the lawsuit, which was filed by a coalition of universities and research institutions, Menefee filed a brief supporting the plaintiffs' claims against the NIH. The TMC and its partner institutions — including University of Houston, Rice University and Texas Heart Institute — provide more than 120,000 jobs throughout the Houston area, according to the brief. The cap effectively represents a 50% cut to indirect cost funding provided by the agency. According to the NIH, which announced the new policy Feb. 7 , an average of close to 30% of institutions' expenses related to administration and facilities was covered by grants provided through the NIH. “Harris County is home to the largest medical center in the world, and these cuts pose a direct threat to public health and our economy,” Menefee said in the release. “This funding supports the life-changing work happening at the Texas Medical Center. It’s not just about numbers on a budget sheet — it’s about jobs, patients and families who rely on medical advancements.” A lawsuit filed by 22 predominantly blue states shortly after the NIH announced the policy led a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction preventing the agency from implementing the cap , but many fear that the decision could soon be reversed. SAVING LIVES: Texas Children's Hospital, MD Anderson join forces to fight childhood cancer Houston-area research institutions collected a combined $263 million in indirect funding grants from the NIH in 2024, according to a database maintained by the agency. Certain institutions — such as Rice University, which recoups 56% of its indirect costs through grants provided by the NIH, according to a Feb. 11 letter published by university President Reginald DesRoches — stand to lose more than others. \"Many of our NIH grants are tied to vital research to address diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease,\" DesRoches wrote. \"Teams across the university are always closely following federal developments, analyzing implications and advocating for the critical work we do. As president, this is something I take very seriously.\"",
