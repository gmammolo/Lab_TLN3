  "text": "FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WFFT) – According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we are experiencing one of the worst flu seasons yet.\nIn Indiana alone there have been close to 100 deaths from the virus this flu season.\nCDC numbers are reflecting a rise in flu cases that tops previous flu seasons within the past decade.\nThere's an almost 3% rise in deaths from the flu just this week.\nMore than 50,000 people were admitted to hospitals with flu this week alone.\nExecutive Director of Super Shot Connie Heflin says a lack of flu vaccines puts everyone at risk.\n“When we get a flu shot individually, it not only protects ourselves, but it also protects everybody else around us. It really makes our community healthier,” Heflin said.\nHeflin also says the flu has the highest impact on young children 6 months and older, older patients and pregnant women as their immune system is weakened.\nShe recommends everyone six months and older should get their annual flu shot.\nTo encourage more people to get their vaccination, Super Shot is offering flu shots at no cost.\n“We don't want people to not get their flu shot and protect their health because they're worried about cost. We accept all insurance forms here at Super Shot,” Heflin said, “If you don't have insurance that's where there's usually a cost and at Super Shot, we ask for a $15 administration fee per vaccine, but if you can't pay that $15 admin fee, there's no problem,”\nThey also have a community flu challenge underway; Heflin says their goal is 150,000 people vaccinated, right now there are close to 100,000.\nTo schedule an appointment, click here.",
