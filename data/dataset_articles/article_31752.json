  "text": "NORTHEAST INDIANA (WFFT) — An Indiana House Bill is aiming to redefine how hospitals achieve and maintain their nonprofit status.\nHouse Bill 1004 passed the full House of Representatives on Thursday in a 68-26 vote and is now headed to the Senate.\nPrimarily, the proposed legislation targets nonprofit hospitals that charge more than 265% above what Medicare pays for the same service.\nAccording to the bill, if the hospitals’ charges exceed 300% and they fail to reduce their prices, they lose their nonprofit status.\nAdditionally, HB 1004 subjects nonprofit hospitals to an annual audit by the Indiana Department of Insurance.\nAdvocacy group Hoosiers for Affordable Healthcare reports that price cuts range from 23-40.8% for Indiana’s big six hospitals to hold onto their nonprofit status.\nParkview Health sits at the top of the list for the largest cuts. The network is based in Fort Wayne with hospital locations in eight northeast Indiana counties.\nAccording to the Indiana Department of Health’s 2021 audited hospital financial statements, nonprofit hospitals had averaged profit margins between 9-17% when the national average sat at 3%.\nAmong those, Ascension St. Vincent had the highest profit margin while Community Health Network came in with the lowest.\nThe bill was authored by Representative Martin Carbaugh, and he gained co-authors Representatives Ben Smaltz, Julie McGuire and Mitch Gore.\nSenators Justin Busch, Tyler Johnson, Ed Charbonneau and Chris Garten have since sponsored the bill.",
