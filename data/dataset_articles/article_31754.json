  "text": "The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, canceled a $275,000 contract for 9/11-related cancer research. The contract paid for data processing work to compare cancer incidence rates among firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center toxins to firefighters in other cities who were not exposed. The FDNY confirmed researchers working on the career firefighter health study received notice of the CDC contract termination last week. \"The World Trade Center Health Program has been a lifeline to sickened 9/11 responders, who selflessly gave so much. Cuts to its grant funding will limit our ability to prove that new conditions are WTC related, and should be added to the list of covered conditions. This will hinder our efforts to provide treatment coverage for new conditions, which is a tragedy for all Americans who swore they would never forget,\" FDNY Commissioner Robert Tucker said. John Feal worked at Ground Zero days after the attack. He has been an advocate for survivors and families since. \"The research is vital to the 9/11 community because it's the research that allows us to add illnesses to the bill as we move forward. Last year we added uterine cancer for the 69th cancer under the bill,\" said John Feal, an activist for 9/11 survivors and victims' families. \"More and more people are getting sick, and more and more people are coming up with new illnesses.\" Michael Barasche has represented nearly 40,000 first responders and civilians with 9/11 illnesses. \"In 2013, no cancers had been linked to the World Trade Center toxins. Today, 69 cancers. Why? We know this because of the research,\" Barasche said. Gov. Kathy Hochul also fired back with a post on social media . \"'Never forget' isn't a slogan, it's a promise to our firefighters, police officers, and all the first responders who ran into danger on 9/11. We'll fight like hell to stop Elon Musk and his cronies from breaking that promise,\" Hochul wrote. It comes as 20% of the World Trade Center Health Program staff was terminated last week, which advocates say affects first responders and people who lived and worked in Lower Manhattan on 9/11, making it harder for them to get certified for a 9/11-related illness. \"The World Trade Center Health Program is a lifeline to 137,000+ people in the program. This staff is understaffed,\" Feal said. FDNY officials say they were told the contract was determined to be non-essential because the outputs from the contract are not statutorally required. We have reached out the White House for comment and have not heard back.",
