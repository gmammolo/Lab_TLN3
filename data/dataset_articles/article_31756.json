Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\nOne student who was struck by the branch suffered significant injuries and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition.\nA spokesperson for the ACT Emergency Services Agency said two other children were treated at the scene for minor injuries but did not require hospital admissions.\nThe school trip was cut short, and the group returned to the Central Coast on Thursday.\nIn a message to parents on Thursday, school principal Phil O’Regan said the female student remained in hospital in a critical condition.\n“Our staff remain in contact with all year 6 families, offering the care and assistance of our counselling and wellbeing teams, and we extend our support to any other student requiring additional help,” the email said.\n“As a close community with strong values, I ask that you keep [the student] and their family in your hearts. Also, that you keep a watchful eye on your child and ask for help if they are struggling to cope with what has occurred.”\nCentral Coast Grammar is an independent K-12 school based in Erina, 350 kilometres from Canberra.\nGet the day’s breaking news, entertainment ideas and a long read to enjoy.
