  "text": "PETALING JAYA: A housemanship of one year instead of two, and restricting the rotation of trainee doctors to six departments – these are among the proposals made by the recently formed Medical Advisory and Action Council (MAAC) to the Health Ministry.According to a ministry circular, the MAAC proposed that the training period be reverted to a year as the Medical Act 1971 outlines that a doctor with provisional registration will require at least one year of training.",
