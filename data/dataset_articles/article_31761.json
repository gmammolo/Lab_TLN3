  "text": "A teenager's childhood love for Harry Potter creatures has transformed into a terrifying reality after doctors discovered \"monster tumors\" growing teeth and eyes and consuming her ovaries. Nesli Meir was on vacation in Guatemala last month (January 16) when she experienced sharp pain in the lower right side of her abdomen. After enduring agony for two days, the 17-year-old went to the hospital, where a CT scan revealed a benign teratoma tumor, commonly referred to as a \"monster tumor.\" Germ cell tumors can appear at any age and develop from cells that produce eggs or sperm. They are most commonly found in the ovaries or testes; however, one or more may develop in other body parts, such as the abdomen. The symptoms depend on where the tumor grows. Typically, it starts with a lump that can be felt, and it may cause other symptoms, such as a swollen stomach.

If the tumor is malignant and can be completely removed through surgery, chemotherapy is not always necessary, especially if it begins in the testis or ovary. If the tumor cannot be easily removed or has spread, chemotherapy will be administered. The scan showed that Nesli's \"tennis-ball-sized\" mass had developed a tooth, while a week later, an ultrasound in San Diego, California, indicated that it might even have an eyeball. Doctors discovered a second \"fingertip-sized\" teratoma, which prompted her to name the pair Terry and Tommy and share light-hearted TikTok videos to \"make light\" of the concerning situation. Her mother, Rachel Silber, mentions that Nesli adored Harry Potter and wished for the franchise's Book of Monsters as a cake for her birthday.

The 55-year-old jokes that Nesli has \"internalized\" the sweet treat by having the \"monster tumors,\" though she acknowledges that the revelation is \"strange\" and \"freaks her out.\" Initially, Nesli thought she had appendicitis, but now she fears she might need to have her right ovary removed because the large mass means she \"doesn't have much tissue left.\" \"I got a really sharp pain in the bottom right of my abdomen while traveling, and I went really nauseous and white,\" she said. \"I thought it was nothing because I'd had them [pains] my whole life, and they would go away after half an hour. This one didn't go away, so I had to go to the doctor. They said it could be appendicitis or a cyst, so I thought it was appendicitis at first. The CT scan showed I had a teratoma, and it was really scary because of how big it is.\" \"They narrowed it down to a teratoma because it has calcification, which means [it has] a tooth. The lady that did the ultrasound said there is a spot that could be an eyeball because it has liquid in it, so we're waiting until the surgery to find out. I've named the tumors Terry and Tommy to make fun of the situation. The pain is really bad, and I try to tune it out, but it's still lingering. They said I might have to get the whole ovary removed because there isn't a lot of ovarian tissue left on the side with the bigger teratoma.\" \"I'm afraid of surgery, so I'm not looking forward to having that done. They will see what's in it when they take it out of me, but I researched what they might grow, and one girl had a whole jaw in hers. That freaks me out. The video I made definitely helps me make light of the situation, and [I get to] see people who are going to get their pain checked. Someone made fan art of the tumors, and I will put it up as a poster in my room. The whole thing is a crazy ride. If anything hurts in that area and won't go away for more than a day I would definitely tell people to get it checked.\" Nesli was informed that tooth growth occurs due to calcification, a process in which elevated calcium levels lead to tissue hardening. She is awaiting surgery to determine precisely what else is present in the teratomas. Still, she mentioned that the presence of fluid inside the large one suggests there might be an eyeball. Her mother, Rachel, from San Diego, California, stated: \"It's really strange. This is a new thing for us because we hadn't heard the word teratoma before, and it means monster tumor. This little kiddo grew up with Harry Potter and wanted The Monster Book of Monsters as a birthday cake, so I joke with her and say she internalised her birthday cake. I'm freaked out because it's like an alien baby without it being a baby or an alien. I don't know how else to describe it. It's very different and very strange.\" Nesli admitted she is worried about not being able to have kids but tries to make light of the situation through videos on TikTok.\nHer most viral clip has more than 18 million views and 13,000 comments.",
