  "text": "Sports\nBrandon Ingram Gets Unfortunate Injury Update For Toronto Raptors\nThe Brandon Ingram trade has been the talk of the town in Canada's lone NBA city. The Toronto Raptors emerged out of nowhere and swooped in to acquire the former New Orleans Pelicans star. It did not cost them a lot either.\nThe Raptors only needed to trade Bruce Brown, Kelly Olynyk, one first-round pick, and one second-round selection to acquire Ingram's services. It was a terrific deal from a value standpoint.\nThe question on everyone's mind now is when the one-time All-Star will don a Raptors jersey on the court for the first time. Ingram's debut is certainly a highly-anticipated one for Raptors fans everywhere.\nThe talented scorer has been out since Dec. 7, when Ingram suffered a severe ankle sprain injury against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Unfortunately for everyone invested into seeing what the former second overall pick looks like with his new team, his return date does not appear to be on the horizon just yet.\nTSN reporter Josh Lewenberg tweeted an update about Ingram's status earlier today. The news was not promising.\n\"Tho Ingram is \"not close\" to playing, per Rajakovic yesterday, he's doing some light work/shooting after practice. Darko: \"He's limited with what he can do with his ankle but his upper body, lifting, we can get on that right now…I'm hopeful he'll be able to ramp up his workouts\"\n-Josh Lewenberg on Twitter/X\nWhile it should be encouraging that Ingram is participating in any form of workouts, practices, and similar activities, it remains obvious that there will not be a rush on having the star forward on the court for the Raptors.\nRelated: Toronto Raptors' Starting Lineup Gets A Massive Shakeup After Brandon Ingram Trade\nToronto should not have a strong desire to push Ingram to play, considering where they are in the standings. The Raptors possess the fifth-worst record in the NBA, and are well on their way to the Cooper Flagg sweepstakes. The urge to be competitive this season and get the added star power onto the court simply is not there for the Raptors.\nRelated: Key Toronto Raptors Star Will Have 27 Games to Secure His Future\nCopyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.
