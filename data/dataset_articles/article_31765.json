(Village of Homer Glen) By Michelle Mullins | Chicago Tribune PUBLISHED: February 20, 2025 at 5:54 PM CST Funeral services will be held Sunday for 9-year-old Adalind Akiko Grande, Homer Glen’s honorary mayor, who died Feb. 14 after a long battle with cancer.\nAdalind, who was affectionately known as Warrior Addy, was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2021 and spent the last several years in and out of remission.\nIn December, Addy, a Homer Glen resident and student at Reed Elementary School, was bestowed the title of honorary mayor and was the guest of honor at the village’s Homer for the Holidays festival. She turned on the holiday lights to kick off the season and had a chance to meet Anna and Olaf from Disney’s “Frozen.”\nAs part of her duties as mayor, she presided over a Village Board meeting. She sat at the head of the dais, led the Pledge of Allegiance and signed important documents.\nAddy’s mom, Jacqueline Grande, said her daughter’s health began deteriorating in late December, and she was sleeping more and eating less.\nGrande, Addy and her younger sister Aurora took a trip to Disney World with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nGrande said that while Addy’s health was starting to worsen and she was having mobility issues, she will never forget the sheer joy and excitement on her daughter’s face during the trip.\nGrande said she will remember Addy for being sweet, loving and kind.\n“She was so smart, so creative,” Grande said. “She was such a good artist. She never ceased to amaze me.”\nOne of their last memories was creating handprints and talking about the television show “Bluey.”\nGrande said the family was able to give her final kisses and say goodbye. She commended Addy’s long battle with cancer, saying she grew up quicker than she should have and “fought so hard.”\n“I have years and years of amazing memories,” Grande said. “She touched so many lives.”\n“I have comfort in knowing she is in heaven and watching over me. I feel she was meant to be my guardian angel.”\nVillage of Homer Glen Addy Grande, 9, and her sister, Aurora, enjoy a visit with “Frozen” characters Anna and Olaf at the Homer for the Holidays festival. Addy, who is known as Warrior Addy, was honorary mayor and turned on the holiday lights for the season. (Village of Homer Glen) The village of Homer Glen released a statement about its “mini Mayor.”\n“Addy’s story was extremely impactful and she made a lasting impression on everyone she met,” the statement said. “Addy, we were honored to have you and will never ever forget you. Thanks for creating lasting memories with us. We will cherish them. Addy’s courage and resilience will live on and encourage others in their fight, and her smile is eternal.”\nProject Fire Buddies, a nonprofit organization of firefighters helping children battling critical illnesses, released a statement from its Homer Township chapter.\n“From the moment she became part of our Fire Buddies family, she showed incredible strength, resilience and a light that could brighten even the darkest days,” it said. “Addy’s spirit will forever remain a part of us, and we are honored to have been a small part of her journey.”\nVisitation will be held from 1 to 7 p.m. Sunday at the Richard J. Modell Funeral Home, 12641 W. 143rd St., Homer Glen. Interment is private.\nIn lieu of flowers, the family asks for donations to Adalind Grande’s Zeffy account , which can be found on the Warrior Addy Facebook page.\nAddy’s obituary can be found at www.rjmodellfh.com .\nMichelle Mullins is a freelance reporter for the Daily Southtown\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window) Click to share on X (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular Gov.
