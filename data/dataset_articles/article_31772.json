  "text": "‘It will kill them’: Sheriff warns new, more powerful fentanyl compound has made its way to Omaha\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - An extremely lethal narcotic has hit the Omaha metro, and local law enforcement is seeing a disturbing trend that is bound to lead to deaths.\nFentanyl is already 50-times stronger than heroin and 100-times stronger than morphine. A lethal dose fits on the tip of a pencil. But local investigators say this new compound is even more powerful.\nWhen someone in Omaha would overdose on fentanyl, it would typically take one dose of NARCAN to block the effects of opiates on the brain and restore breathing.\nDouglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson say it’s now taking two, sometimes even up to four or five doses of NARCAN to save a life.\n“Six months ago, we were seeing maybe one to two overdoses every week,” Hanson said. “Now, we’re seeing three or four a week. We didn’t think that we could get much more scared of the effects of fentanyl until we saw this new compound of fentanyl.”\nThe new compound in question comes after overdoses dropped nearly 40 percent after the creation of the Omaha Overdose Response Task Force more than two years ago.\nThe sheriff’s office recently uncovered evidence of fentanyl powder in one baggie, and next to it, a bottle of what appears to be Xanax — a popular prescription medication used to reduce anxiety.\nOnly these are fake Xanax pills.\n“As we speak, there’s a young man or woman getting ready to go to a club and they will ingest what they think is Adderall or Xanax, but in fact, it’s this new, more potent compound of fentanyl,” Hanson said. “And it will kill them.”\nA warning that bears repeating: Experts say 70 percent of pills that look like prescription medicine actually contain fentanyl.\nAnd life will get harder for first responders, too, because NARCAN cannot get cold, so officers can’t store it in their car during the winter. If it takes several more doses to save a life with this new compound, that creates a new set of problems that law enforcement will need to address.\nCopyright 2025 WOWT. All rights reserved.",
