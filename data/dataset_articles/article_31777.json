Photo: Chris Schwegler/NBAE via Getty\nSan Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the 2024-2025 NBA season due to a blood clot, the team announced on Thursday, Feb. 20.\nWembanyama, 21, was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the Spurs said . He received the diagnosis after returning to San Antonio following the NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco.\nThe reigning NBA Rookie of the Year started feeling symptoms recently, but thought he would feel better during the two days off after the All-Star Game, sources told ESPN . The symptoms continued though, and he underwent tests that showed the blood clot.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nVictor Wembanyama's Family: All About His Parents and Siblings Victor W. Greg Fiume/Getty\nA Spurs source told ESPN they are “optimistic” Wembanyama will “make a full recovery” before the 2025-2026 season starts.\n\"It's tough,\" Wembanyama’s teammate, point guard Chris Paul, told ESPN. \"Tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play.\"\nSpurs Coach Gregg Popovich Says He's 'Forever Grateful' for Support After Suffering Mild Stroke Victor W. Jacob Kupferman/Getty\nWembanyama won the NBA Rookie of the Year title after last season and made his first All-Star Game this year. He played in 46 games this season, averaging 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 3.8 blocks. He was considered a favorite for the Defensive Player of the Year award, but will be ineligible for it and other year-end awards because he will not meet the 65-game minimum.\nThe Spurs are 23-29 and have been without their head coach Gregg Popovich for most of the season. The Basketball Hall of Famer, 76, took a leave of absence after suffering a mild stroke in November .\nClose",
