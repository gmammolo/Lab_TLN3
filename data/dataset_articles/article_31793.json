  "text": "The five-year loss for Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd (SZSE:002838) shareholders likely driven by its shrinking earnings\nShandong Dawn Polymer Co.,Ltd. (SZSE:002838) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 13% in the last month. But don't envy holders -- looking back over 5 years the returns have been really bad. The share price has failed to impress anyone , down a sizable 58% during that time. So we're hesitant to put much weight behind the short term increase. Of course, this could be the start of a turnaround.\nWhile the stock has risen 8.0% in the past week but long term shareholders are still in the red, let's see what the fundamentals can tell us.\n See our latest analysis for Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nLooking back five years, both Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 3.8% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 16% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nThis free interactive report on Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nA Different Perspective\nWe're pleased to report that Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 31% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 9% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that Shandong Dawn PolymerLtd is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
