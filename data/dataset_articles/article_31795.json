  "text": "The Institute of Atmosphere and Climate Change of UNAM has alerted that this year will be one of the hottest in the history of Mexico. The prognosis indicates that temperatures could be kept high for several months, affecting various regions of the country. Given this, the Institute recommends that the population be prepared to support extreme heat.\nThe increase in temperatures can generate serious health consequences, from dehydration to severe heat blows. Authorities urge citizens to take precautions to avoid these risks. Among the recommendations are to stay hydrated and avoid direct exposure to the sun during the most intense hours of the day.\nTo deal with heat at home, experts suggest several strategies. Although the use of fans and air conditioning helps lower the temperature, it also increases energy consumption. Therefore, it is advisable to take advantage of cross ventilation, keep the rooms that receive direct sun and place plants that help mitigate heat, such as fern or ‘tiger tongue’.\nThe UNAM anticipates the arrival of four consecutive heat waves, which will begin in the third week of March and could extend until October. The northern states, such as Sonora, Sinaloa and Baja California, will be the most affected. These heat waves are a consequence of climate change, driven by the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and poor urban planning.\nSV\nThemes\nRead too\n(tagstotranslate) heat season",
