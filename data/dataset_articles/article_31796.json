TOPLINE:\nObesity significantly reduced the effectiveness of febuxostat-based urate-lowering therapy among men with gout, with those with obesity showing lower target achievement rates and more flares than their normal-weight counterparts.\nMETHODOLOGY:\nThis prospective cohort study evaluated the response to febuxostat in men with gout, who were classified into different body mass index (BMI) categories: Normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 24), overweight (24 ≤ BMI < 28), and obese (BMI ≥ 28).\nOverall, 527 men (age, 18-70 years) who received 20 mg febuxostat daily for the first 4 weeks, with the dose increased to 40 mg daily if serum urate (SU) levels remained > 6 mg/dL during follow-up visits every 4 weeks, completed the study.\nThe primary outcome was the achievement rate of SU levels < 6 mg/dL after 12 weeks of treatment.\nThe secondary outcomes included the achievement rate of SU levels < 5 mg/dL and the proportion of patients requiring 40 mg…\nEdited by Shreyasi Asthana",
