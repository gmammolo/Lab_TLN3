  "text": "The administration's suggestion that psychotropic drugs pose a 'threat' to children has raised fears that a new presidential commission could recommend limiting medication access. The Trump administration's plans to study the \"threat\" posed by psychiatric medications in children have medical societies and mental health professionals concerned that the administration may be considering restrictions on the use of psychotropic drugs in pediatric patients.\nAn executive order signed last week created the \"Make American Healthy Again Commission\" to investigate the nation's \"escalating health crisis,\" particularly in child health. Recently confirmed Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will chair the effort.\nAs part of its investigation, the executive order directed the commission to assess \"the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\"\nA report on the commission's findings is due in a little less than 100 days. Eighty days later, the commission must submit recommendations for federal action.\nAlthough who the commission members are and the scope of its work is unclear, the language in the executive order — namely the implication that the Trump administration views psychotropic medication as a \"threat\" to children — was enough to prompt psychiatrists from across the country to contact the American Psychiatric Association (APA) about possible limitations on the use of psychotropic medications in pediatric patients.\nMarketa Wills, MD, MBA\n\"It's concerning and surprising that some of our nation's most vulnerable children who need these treatments to participate fully in life would be under scrutiny in this way,\" Marketa Wills, MD, MBA, chief executive officer and medical director for the APA, told Medscape Medical News.\n\"If these medications are under threat and children decompensate that would not be good from a public health perspective, for the health care system or for the families we serve,\" Wills said.\nPast Comments Fuel Distress\nPast comments by the commission chair…\nKelli Whitlock Burton",
