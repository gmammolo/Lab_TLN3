  "text": "The Charleroi Area School District has moved to remote learning after a number of students, teachers, and district support staff workers became sick with flu and strep.\nIn an attempt to reduce the spread of Influenza Type A and strep, the elementary, middle and high schools will be closed on Friday, and students will attend classes following their remote learning school schedule.\nA message on the district website indicated the decision to pivot to remote learning had been made after a consultation between district administrators and school nurses, “with the well-being of our school community as our top priority.”\nThe district encourages families to take precautions to stay healthy, including practicing good hygiene, monitoring for symptoms, and seeking medical care if needed.\nAnyone with questions is encouraged to contact a building principal or visit the district website for updates.\nInfluenza activity is very high in Pennsylvania, but has decreased slightly from last week, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.",
