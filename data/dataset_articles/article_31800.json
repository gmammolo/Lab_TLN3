  "text": "A local neurosurgeon's medical license has been suspended, and he may face more disciplinary action for performing \"unnecessary operations\" on three patients in 2024 — two of whom died following their procedures, according to a letter from the state medical board.\nDr. Jeffrey Hatef, 36, who practices at Mount Carmel East Hospital, had his medical license suspended on Feb. 12. The State Medical Board of Ohio said in a letter that it is considering permanently revoking Hatef's medical license, and he may face a maximum civil penalty of $20,000.\nWhile his license is suspended, Hatef, who resides in New Albany, is not allowed to practice medicine or surgery in Ohio.\nIn an emailed statement to The Dispatch, Mount Carmel Health System said they were aware of Hatef's suspension and that they would cooperate with the medical board's investigative process. His clinical privileges at Mount Carmel facilities have been suspended, and he is on administrative leave, the health system said.\nHatef performed unnecessary surgery on three patients between July and October 2024, two of whom died, according to a letter from the medical board.\nThe first patient, who Hatef performed surgery on July 9, 2024, was a 72-year-old man with several medical conditions, including hypertension and morbid obesity. According to the letter, Hatef recommended that the man undergo an \"excessive and/or unjustified\" joint fusion surgery to address the man's leg pain.\nThe letter also accuses Hatef of misrepresenting the reasons for the surgery, and that the patient experienced \"hemorrhagic shock\" after the operation, a life-threatening condition where a person loses a significant amount of blood. The board said that the surgery was excessive and unjustified due to a lack of support in the man's medical records for the procedure and his multiple medical conditions.\nThe second patient, a 78-year-old woman who the letter says Hatef began treating on Oct. 7, 2024, died after a surgery that Hatef recommended to restore the alignment of the vertebrae while stabilizing her thoracic spine. During the surgery, the woman lost around three liters of blood and required a transfusion.\nAfter the surgery, the woman continued to have an insufficient blood flow and required resuscitation, which was unsuccessful, according to the letter. She died on or around Oct. 11, 2024, and the board called her death \"reasonably predictable\" due to her age and medical conditions.\nThe third patient, who Hatef began treating Sept. 17, 2024, was a 77-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, anorexia, side effects from cancer radiation and shortness of breath. The letter states that the woman was complaining of back and neck pain and had issues holding her head up right. As with his second patient, Hatef recommended surgery that would restore the alignment of the vertebrae while stabilizing her thoracic spine. Hatef performed the surgery, but according to the board, there was \"minimal correction\" to the woman's condition following the procedure.\nAfter the surgery, the woman was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she died on Sept. 28, 2024, due to additional complications from the operation, the letter states. The board said in the letter that the woman's death was \"reasonably predictable\" given her age, health conditions, and the magnitude of the surgery.\nHatef is entitled to a hearing with the state medical board to answer the accusations listed in the letter. If he does request a hearing, it must be done within 30 days of the suspension.\nAccording to Hatef's professional website , he attended Duke University School of Medicine and then completed his residency at Ohio State University. He also completed an adult spine fellowship at OSU, and then completed a pediatric spine fellowship at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\nsmeighan@dispatch.com\n@ShahidMeighan\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail",
