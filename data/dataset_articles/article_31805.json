  "text": "The news no one wanted to hear was announced. Victor Wembanyama will miss the rest of the season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his shoulder.\nIt’s a scary time for both Wembanyama and the Spurs, as the star big man’s career could be in jeopardy if the clotting issues are persistent. Fortunately, the franchise seems optimistic about a full recovery and the chance of having Wemby available next year.\nIt would be reckless to speculate with no more information available, so at this point, the working assumption is that San Antonio’s superstar will return next season. With that foundation in mind, let’s take a look at what the news about Wemby means for the team.\nThe timing is bad in the short term but good in the long term\nThere’s no replacing someone as good as Wembanyama, but if the news had come out a few weeks earlier, the Spurs could have at least attempted to get a quality big man to try to salvage the season. Alas, the trade deadline came and went and there are now very few options to plug the major hole Wembanyama’s absence leaves in San Antonio’s center rotation. A team that was already thin at that position and was electing to play small because of the inadequacies of their backup bigs now finds itself in the unenviable position of having to improvise a solution to losing one of the most impactful big men in the league. The timing of the diagnosis, as far as this season is concerned, could not be worse.\nTaking the long view, however, presents a more positive outlook. The most encouraging aspect is that Wembanyama should have plenty of time to undergo treatment and hopefully recover in time for next season. Training camp is seven months away, so heading into 2025-26 there should be clarity about Wemby’s availability. Had the unfortunate situation happened earlier in the year, fans would have not only missed out on witnessing Wemby’s ascent but also the Spurs would have likely not been able to get De’Aaron Fox. Had it happened later in the year, the timeline for treatment would have been tighter. Right now San Antonio is out of the play-in in the standings, so Wembanyama is not missing a contending year, like Tim Duncan did in the 2000 season.\nIf Wembanyama returns next year, as the team expects him to, the rebuild remains perfectly on schedule. His absence will make the rest of the season less enjoyable but it won’t disrupt San Antonio’s meticulous plan to build a winner.\nThe season is over and the Spurs should treat it as such\nWhile there’s not enough time to fully tank, the Spurs should consider their season over and act accordingly. There’s no need to pretend that the team, without Wembanyama, can make the play-in. Even with their biggest star dominating his minutes, the year was shaping up to be transitional and the news just confirms it. With that in mind, the front office and the coaching staff should completely change how they approach the rest of the season. It doesn’t mean they should go all out to try to lose, but there’s no need to juggle the parallel goals of winning and development. The priority should shift fully to the latter, even if it means having to make some tough decisions.\nCharles Bassey should get every chance to prove he can be a rotation center in the league, as soon as he’s healthy. The Spurs invested little money but allotted him a roster spot for two seasons and it’s unclear if he’s worth one. Figuring that out is a must. To a lesser extent, the same applies to Malaki Branham and Blake Wesley, who’ve had more opportunities and will be under contract next season. Chris Paul and Harrison Barnes will get minutes and their leadership could continue to be invaluable to a young team that has lost its coach and superstar for the year, but there should be a concerted effort to find playing time for younger players like Stephon Castle and Jeremy Sochan. Even young veterans like Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson should see their roles increase as the front office evaluates their part in the future. De’Aaron Fox should be considered the centerpiece, for now.\nThe goal of winning to make the play-in is gone. It doesn’t mean the Spurs should blatantly tank, but it does mean they should shift all their focus to the future and act accordingly in terms of personnel and rotational decisions.\nThe news about Wembanyama’s health problems is devastating. There’s no need to spin it any other way. A young star who clearly loves the game will be sidelined for the rest of the season, and that’s the best-case scenario. There are no silver linings here and no one can blame fans for checking out on the season and only caring about Wemby’s recovery.\nThe Spurs’ decision-makers don’t have that luxury. They need to continue to improve the team so that when Victor Wembanyama is back, he’ll have the supporting cast his talent deserves. The next few months will be massive for the franchise, so hopefully everyone involved will rise to the occasion and excel at what they can control to at least mitigate the negative impact of the unfortunate situation facing the team.",
