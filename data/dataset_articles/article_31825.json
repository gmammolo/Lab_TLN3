He received the diagnosis after returning to San Antonio following the NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco.\nThe reigning NBA Rookie of the Year started feeling symptoms recently, but thought he would feel better during the two days off after the All-Star Game, sources told ESPN . The symptoms continued though, and he underwent tests that showed the blood clot.\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nRelated: Victor Wembanyama's Family: All About His Parents and Siblings\nGreg Fiume/Getty\nVictor W.

He was considered a favorite for the Defensive Player of the Year award, but will be ineligible for it and other year-end awards because he will not meet the 65-game minimum.\nThe Spurs are 23-29 so far this season and have been without their head coach Gregg Popovich for most of the season. The Basketball Hall of Famer, 76, took a leave of absence after suffering a mild stroke in November .\nRead the original article on People",
