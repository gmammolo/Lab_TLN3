  "text": "Ronnie Platt of Kansas Announces Cancer Diagnosis and Canceled Tour\nKansas frontman Ronnie Platt recently announced that he has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and has to cancel upcoming Kansas shows. Platt shared the tough news on social media and wrote, “For all of you asking, Tuesday I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer but before everyone gets all excited, it has a 99% survival rate, it has not spread. It’s contained to my thyroid. I just have to have my thyroid removed. Go through some rehab time and be right back in the saddle.”\nHe continued, “I sincerely appreciate everyone’s positive thoughts and prayers. I have some absolutely amazing people going to bat for me!! as it has been put to me, this is just a bump in the road and will be behind me very soon! so everyone please CARRY ON!”\nWhile Platt undergoes treatments and recovers, Kansas is forced to cancel all upcoming shows including several in Louisiana. The band said that tickets will be refunded and they hope to get back on the road as soon as Platt is healthy enough.\nUnfortunately, this is not the first time the band had to cancel shows in the past year. During the final leg of the band’s 50th Anniversary Tour, the original drummer and band manager, Phil Ehart, had to step away after a heart attack. Other shows were also canceled due to hurricanes and illness.\nKansas, best known for their hit song “Carry On Wayward Son,” released their debut album back in 1974 and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. We wish Platt well and hope the band members can stay healthy and continue their tour later this year. What’s your favorite Kansas song? Let us know in the comments!\n Birth of Rock 'n' Roll\nFebruary 2024\n\"Long live rock,\" we like to say, but how did it come to life? Revisit the memorable moments, music and movies that made teens go beat crazy back in the 1950s.\nBuy This Issue",
