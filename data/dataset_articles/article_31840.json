  "text": "Savage Cat Food recently made the following statement, posted on their website :\n“Savage Pet was made aware of one cat in Colorado who contracted highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), got sick and recovered. The cat owner contacted the retailer who notified us on January 30, 2025. Savage Pet contacted the Colorado State Veterinarian for verification but did not receive a response until February 13, 2025. Meanwhile, Colorado contacted the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) who contacted Savage Pet on February 11, 2025.\nThus far, the Colorado State University Laboratory has tested sealed packets of Savage Cat Food using PCR testing for HPAI. The PCR test results are “not negative” for lot number 11152026 (chicken packets). Two other lot codes were tested and the results were negative. The product with “not negative” PCR results has been sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa for virus isolation testing. Virus isolation testing is currently the only laboratory test that determines if the DNA in the product is infective. We are awaiting these test results.\nSavage Pet has always been dedicated to the health of its feline consumers. All of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed. Our suppliers follow the National Poultry Improvement Plan and work under daily USDA inspection. Savage Pet has adhered to Good Manufacturing Practices and sanitation standard operating procedures for almost 10 years.\nAs a precaution, we have contacted every retailer who may have received the product with lot code/best buy date of 11152026 which was manufactured and sold in Large and Small Chicken Boxes in November 2024. Consumers can cook the packets in a sous vide at 165°F or return them to the retailer for a full refund.”\nSavage Pet Food also provides some Questions and Answers for pet owners, a few we share below:\n“Are you testing the final product for H5N1?\nThere are no FDA-approved food commercially available lab tests available for H5N1/HPAI. We have sent inquiries to our laboratory partners to let us know when a food test becomes available.\nWhat are the safety measures Savage Pet is taking to address H5N1 in their products?\nThe USDA is responsible for keeping H5N1 out of the supply chain by testing flocks and culling any flock with a bird that tests positive. We source only USDA inspected and passed poultry slaughtered for human consumption.”\nThe Bigger Picture TruthaboutPetFood.com has been informed by multiple parties that the ONLY lab in the US that can confirm active Avian Flu in a pet food (or human food) is the National Veterinary Services Laboratories , which is part of the USDA.\nWe sent this USDA laboratory the following questions…\nDoes the National Veterinary Services Laboratories offer testing of pet food samples for avian flu? I am aware you have done testing for Oregon Department of Agriculture, but do you offer testing for the public? I have been told the FDA has instructed your lab to “do not test” for pet food companies or the public, is this correct? It took two attempts, but finally the USDA laboratory responded with:\n“ NVSL has performed PCR testing on pet food samples in collaboration with state public health and animal health departments.\nNVSL primarily conducts testing for regulatory and surveillance purposes in collaboration with state and federal agencies.\nThe FDA has specific guidelines and regulations regarding the testing of pet food and around any claims that may lead to a recall.”\nThe absurdity of only one laboratory in the U.S. having the capability/testing method to confirm active Highly Pathogenic Avian Flu (HPAI) is magnified when you know that this pathogen has been in the U.S. for decades. In a 2015 report prepared by the Congressional Research Services (CRS) for Congress, “ Prior HPAI outbreaks in the United States occurred in 1924, 1983, and 2004. “\nRegarding the 2014/2015 outbreak, this CRS report stated: “The U.S. poultry industry is experiencing a severe outbreak of highly-pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has reported 223 cases of HPAI in domestic flocks in 15 states.”\nIn decades of outbreaks of HPAI – why does only ONE laboratory have the method to confirm a food is positive/infective for such a serious pathogen?\nFor decades, government authorities have done nothing to enable easy-accessible testing of pet food/human food for HPAI. Decade after decade, members of Congress have done nothing to require easy-accessible testing for the public and food industries. How can any food manufacturer assure their products are safe if they have no access to testing?\nBut there is one more thing in the bigger picture…\nThere are currently two pet foods (both raw) that regulatory authorities are claiming to have products HPAI positive: Wild Coast and Savage. With a previous (raw) pet food – Northwest Naturals – regulatory also claimed the product was HPAI positive, however National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed this pet food was NOT contaminated with HPAI. All of these pet foods source ONLY USDA inspected and passed meats; the same meats from the same meat suppliers that sell in your local grocery.\nIF…and we must wait for the National Veterinary Services Laboratories testing of the recently claimed positive products for confirmation (because they are the ONLY lab that can do the confirmation testing)…if these products test positive/infective for HPAI avian flu – this means that the human food chain is likely contaminated as well.\nIF that scenario plays out…will regulatory tell the general public of the risk in their grocery, will meats in the grocery be recalled, or will they only link the Avian Flu to (raw) pet food – misleading the general public?\nTime will tell.\nSusan Thixton\nPet Food Safety Advocate\nAuthor Buyer Beware, Co-Author Dinner PAWsible\nTruthaboutPetFood.com\nAssociation for Truth in Pet Food\nBecome a member of our pet food consumer Association.
