  "text": "Digital addiction in children is defined as excessive dependence on digital devices and online content. With the easy availability of digital devices like mobile phones, tablets and computers, children are increasingly exposed to digital addiction. They use these devices for social media, web browsing and online video gaming. This leads to dangerous over exposure, resulting in excessive screen time, reduced physical activity, social isolation and difficulty in forming real-life connections.\nChildren are the most vulnerable to digital addiction, as they are at a developmental stage where digital gadgets are highly enticing. Their developing brains are more prone to addiction than those of adults. The growing amount of time children spend on electronic devices has become a significant concern in our increasingly connected world. According to a survey by Baatu Tech, “60 percent of children exhibit behaviors indicative of potential digital addiction, and 85 percent of parents express difficulties in managing their children’s online consumption.” The survey highlighted gaming and social media as the two most dominant platforms frequented by children.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has also expressed significant concern about digital addiction among Children. In 2020, the WHO officially recognized digital addiction as a global issue, noting that excessive use of digital devices leads to poor time management, reduced energy and attention spans, and disturbed sleep patterns or insomnia. According to the WHO, digital addiction among children is a growing concern, with guidelines recommending that children under 2 years old should have no screen time at all, while those aged 2-5 years should be limited to a maximum of one hour per day, with high- quality content and parental supervision.\nDigital addiction among children is now considered more dangerous than drug addiction. Studies have found that internetaddiction is four times more harmful than drugs, damaging brain development to levels comparable with cocaine addiction. Nathan Driskell, a therapist in Texas, USA, states, “Digital addiction is worse than alcohol or drug abuse because it is more engaging and lacks the stigma associated with substance abuse.\nIn Kashmir, experts have recently voiced their concerns about the growing issue of digital dependency among children. They termed it an “invisible pandemic” that is causing a severe impact on children’s mental, physical, and social well being. The experts emphasized the need for interventions, including medical guidelines for healthy digital media usage. They stressed the importance of nurturing and protecting children within environments that promote overall development.\nCreating awareness and engaging in discussions about the costs and consequences of unrestricted digital access is crucial. Parents, educators, and society must recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship with technology. It is our collective responsibility to guide children with wisdom, balance and proper care. We must teach them to use technology responsibly, encourage healthy screen habits, and foster real-world interactions. By creating a supportive environment, we can help children navigate the digital world safely while benefiting from technology’s potential for learning and growth.\n(Author can be reached at: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f99b988a91908b948c8398949095cdc1b99e94989095d79a9694))",
