  "text": "Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Bobby Miller was struck in the head by a 106-mph comebacker during Thursday's spring training opener in Phoenix but walked off the field on his own. Facing the Chicago Cubs' Michael Busch in the top of the third inning, Miller couldn't get his glove up in time to avoid taking Busch's drive off his right temple and immediately went to the ground, clutching his face and head. He was able to get on one knee while being tended to by the training staff before leaving the field. \"Certainly a very scary moment,\" manager Dave Roberts told SportsNet LA. \"From what I've gathered, he's going to be under concussion protocol. We'll keep an eye on him tonight. I don't know what that means as far as going forward. Certainly it's somewhat of a setback. \"We've got to make sure that he feels OK going forward. I don't know how long this protocol lasts. But it was good to see him walk off the field, know where he was at, and all that.\" A candidate for the fifth spot in the Dodgers' rotation, Miller remained in the dugout until the inning ended, then walked to the clubhouse sporting a large welt on the right side of his forehead. \"It's always very terrifying and frightening,\" teammate Max Muncy told reporters. \"Thankfully, he seemed like he was OK. When the trainer came out and asked him if he knew where he was at, he made a little joke about hanging a curveball. Right then, you kind of knew he was fine. \"Obviously you have to take it slow with that type of thing. He might be fine now, but you've got to see how he is the next couple of days. I think he's doing OK.\" Miller, who turns 26 on April 5, burst onto the scene as a rookie in 2023, finishing 11-4 with a 3.76 ERA in 22 starts, but was limited to 13 starts in 2024 due to injuries and inconsistency and finished 2-4 with an 8.52 ERA. The Dodgers' first-round pick in the 2020 draft didn't pitch in the playoffs for the 2024 World Series champions. --Field Level Media\nDodgers RHP Bobby Miller beaned by liner, walks off field\n- Field Level Media\n- Updated\nTags\n-\nMlb -\nStory -\nNews -\nBobby Miller (baseball) -\nMajor League Baseball -\nLos Angeles Dodgers -\nMajor League Baseball Teams -\nOklahoma City Baseball Club Players -\nGreat Lakes Loons Players -\nBaseball -\nBaseball Teams -\nSports -\nOklahoma City Dodgers -\nOklahoma City Dodgers Players -\nRancho Cucamonga Quakes Players -\nBaseball Positions -\nLos Angeles Dodgers Players -\nLos Angeles Dodgers Field Personnel -\n[Collegiate Summer Baseball League Players](/search/?k=%22collegiate%20summer%20baseball%20league%20players%22#tncms-source=keyword)\nFeatured Local Savings\nSuccess!
