(FOX5) - A report from Las Vegas police revealed that a UNLV Football recruit had chest pains before he died.\nFOX5 obtained the incident report when Metro police responded to a home near Tropicana and Maryland on Feb. 11.\nWhen officers arrived, they found Benjamin Christman dead. He was 21. Police were met by two men who said they went to check up on him since he didn’t show up to practice.\nWhen the pair arrived, they told police he was motionless.\nAnother person at the scene told officers that Christman had chest pains during practice. They said a coach conducted an EKG on him at UNLV and sent him to their team’s cardio doctor.\nEverything looked normal, they told police.\nPolice interviewed another person who said Christman went into his room the night before, saying hello. They wouldn’t see him again for the rest of the night and next day.\nPolice said they did not find any weapons, narcotics, medications or suspicious items in the house.\nHis hometown was Akron, Ohio.\nA UNLV spokesperson provided the following statement:\nCopyright 2025 KVVU.
