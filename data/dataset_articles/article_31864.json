  "text": "The bird flu, currently spreading through animals and some people, is known to scientists as Type A H5N1 influenza. But there are different strains. A version known as B3.13 was confirmed after spreading to cattle in late 2023. It has infected 962 cattle herds in 16 states, with the vast majority in California. A newer version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on January 31, 2025. It was found in milk collected as part of a monitoring program started in December.\nThis discovery means distinct forms of the virus have spread from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts in the United States indicate concerns regarding the broader spread of infections and the challenges in controlling them in both animals and the people who work with them. This comes after the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees in all federal departments. The cuts included nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — roughly one-tenth of the agency’s workforce.
