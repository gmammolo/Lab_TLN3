It is believed that thrombosis, a form of a blood clot, is an isolated condition for the 21-year-old All-Star. The clot was discovered following his return to San Antonio from the NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco last week.\nAs reported by [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/43937353/spurs-shut-victor-wembanyama-blood-clot-shoulder), sources close to the Spurs have indicated that Wembanyama is expected to make a full recovery before the 25-26 season.\nWemby's absence for the rest of the season is a devastating loss for the Spurs, especially following his historic first season in the league. The absence also means he's not eligible for awards such as Defensive Player of the Year—an award he was a favorite for before the announcement—which has a 65-game minimum.\nWembanyama has yet to comment on the news.\nSHOP NEW ARRIVALS\n[Shop Now](https://www.complex.com/shop/collections/new-arrivals)\nHellstar\nHellstar Sports Flame Zip-Up\nOhana Hatake\nOhana Full-Bloom Tigerlily\nSelena Gomez\nI Said I Love You First - COMPLEX Exclusive Clearwater Vinyl\nOM New York\nCreme Rose",
