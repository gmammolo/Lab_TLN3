  "text": "As the NBA readied itself to return from the All-Star break, a worrying bit of news developed out of San Antonio.\nSpurs All-Star center Victor Wembanyama has been diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder and will miss the rest of the season.\nEssentially, Wembanyama has a form of blood clot, which the Spurs discovered after Wembanyama's return to San Antonio after All-Star weekend.\nNeedless to say, any type of blood clot is enormously serious, to the point where basketball concerns are simply secondary.\nThis isn't the first health scare in San Antonio this season, as head coach Gregg Popovich suffered a mild stroke on Nov.",
