  "text": "Jasmine Pineda is experiencing some health issues amid her pregnancy .\nThe 90 Day Fiance star shared several photos on Thursday, implying that she and/or her baby are suffering from a health issue.\nThe Panamanian native uploaded two pictures and a video to her Instagram Story, all taken from inside an examination room, either in a doctor’s office, urgent care facility, or hospital.\nIn the first photo, Jasmine looked somewhat upbeat, making a peace sign with her hand and a kissy face with her mouth as she lay on an exam chair.\nJasmine was covered with white blankets, and her baby bump was connected to a fetal monitor.\nIn the second slide, Jasmine recorded the sound of her baby’s heartbeat playing on the machine hooked up to the fetal monitoring belt attached to her midsection.\nJasmine tells her fans she’s ‘not going home today’ after being seen by a medical professional Jasmine held what appeared to be either an intravenous hand button or a nurse call button in her left hand as she recorded herself.\nShe captioned the video, “Not feeling well today.”\nIn another slide, Jasmine moved from the exam chair to a regular chair, still covered in white blankets.\nJasmine’s facial expression was solemn as she stared straight ahead.\nThe expectant reality TV star wrote, “Well… we’re not going home today.”\nJasmine shared photos from inside an exam room while she was hooked up to pregnancy monitors. Pic credit: @jasminepanama/Instagram Jasmine’s post was ambiguous Jasmine’s Stories raise questions about her well-being and that of her unborn child.\nIt’s unclear if Jasmine was admitted to a hospital. Her statement that she wasn’t going home seems to indicate that she was being kept somewhere for further medical evaluation and treatment.\nJasmine didn’t provide any other details, leaving her 352,000 Instagram followers curious about her health and safety.\nWhether Jasmine is ill, her baby is suffering from a health crisis, or Jasmine is in labor remains to be seen.\nJasmine recently confirmed the pregnancy rumors that have surrounded her for months, but she didn’t share her due date, so no one knows how far along she is in her pregnancy.\nShe shared that her baby-to-be belongs to her boyfriend, Matt Branistareanu, and not her estranged husband, Gino Palazzolo.\nJasmine is dealing with a lot of responsibilities The contentious 90 Day Fiance personality certainly has a lot on her plate.\nIn addition to preparing to welcome her third child this year, Jasmine is undergoing a “very expensive and overwhelming” visa application process.\nAs Monsters and Critics reported, Jasmine told an Instagram follower she’s trying to bring her sons , Juance and JC, to the US to live with her.\nJasmine explained that if her boys’ visas are denied, she will return to Panama permanently.\nThis would create major hurdles in her already tangled love life.\nJasmine is now officially romantically linked to her baby daddy, a US resident, and hinted that Gino has joined their “polyamorous” relationship .\nMoving back to Panama with her two sons and a newborn would certainly make Jasmine’s personal life a lot more complicated than it already is.\nSeason 2 of 90 Day: The Last Resort airs on Mondays at 8/7c on TLC.",
