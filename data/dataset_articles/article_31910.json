  "text": "BLOOMINGTON — A man from Springfield is accused of selling drugs that authorities said caused a McLean County woman's death last July.\nLonnie I. Williams, 43, is charged with drug induced homicide, a Class X felony; and unlawful delivery of a controlled substance, a Class 2 felony.\nWilliams is accused of selling heroin to Kaitlynn R. Lovel, 32, of Bloomington, on July 29, which resulted in her death the following day.\nThe defendant appeared in court Thursday afternoon before Judge Scott Black. Assistant State's Attorney Spencer Chikahisa filed a petition to detain Williams on the grounds of dangerousness.\nAccording to the probable cause statement, Bloomington police opened an investigation into Lovel's death after her body was found July 30, 2024, inside a trailer in the 1500 block of Beta Street.\nUpon arrival, police also found drug paraphernalia inside the residence, including razor blades and needle plungers.\nLovel's boyfriend told police he last saw her alive at 2 a.m. on July 30 before going to sleep. When he woke up at approximately 3 p.m., Lovel was deceased, Chikahisa said.\nTwo other individuals reportedly saw Lovel the night she died. These two witnesses told police Lovel had purchased heroin on July 29 from a man who goes by the nickname \"Mo.\"\nLovel and the two surviving witnesses all used the heroin, the two witnesses told police. After they used the drugs, Lovel appeared to be getting sick. Before they left the residence around 11 p.m. July 29, one witness gave her two doses of naloxone, the medication commonly sold under the brand name Narcan that is used to temporarily reverse an opioid overdose.\nThen, on July 30, her boyfriend called the two witnesses around 3 p.m. to tell them Lovel had died, Chikahisa said.\nThe witnesses gave police a description for the man who sold Lovel the heroin, describing him as a Black man with locs and a star tattoo near his eye.\nBloomington police found the cellphone number listed as \"Mo\" in Lovel's contact list and learned it was linked to the defendant, Lonnie Williams.\nOfficers also compared the witnesses' description with a recent booking photo of Williams and found they were consistent.\nWilliams\nhad already been detained, arrested on Aug. 6, 2024, in an Illinois State Police investigation in which he was accused of selling heroin to a police informant, the prosecutor said.\nFinal autopsy reports found Lovel died from consumption of a substance containing clonazolam.\nDuring an interview with police, Williams told officers he purchases large amounts of heroin from Chicago and brings the drugs to McLean County, Chikahisa said.\nHe told police his phone number, which matched the number Lovel had for \"Mo,\" and Williams called himself Lovel's \"source,\" saying he sold her approximately half a gram of heroin on July 29, according to the probable cause statement.\nAssistant Public Defender Mackenzie Frizzell said because Williams is already in custody in another case, the defense wished to concede to the state's petition to detain, so he can earn credit for his time in custody on this case.\nCourt records indicate Williams is extended-term eligible for these offenses and would face a 85% sentencing rule if he is convicted of the Class X felony.\nWilliams is set for an arraignment in this case on March 7 at 9 a.m.",
