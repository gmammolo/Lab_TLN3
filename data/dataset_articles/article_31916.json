  "text": "THURSDAY, Feb. 20, 2025 (HealthDay News) -- New numbers have been released by the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) in an update on the measles outbreak in Gaines County and the surrounding communities: 58 individuals, including at least 48 children and six adults, have been infected as of Feb. 18.\nGaines County remains the hotspot of the outbreak (45 cases), but surrounding counties are also beginning to see cases: nine cases in Terry County, two in Yoakum County, one in Lynn County, and one in Lubbock County. Most cases have been identified among unvaccinated individuals; however, four individuals say they have been vaccinated. Symptom onset began within the last three weeks, and so far, 13 patients have been hospitalized.\nFree vaccination clinics for the community are being hosted by the local health departments in West Texas. At a clinic hosted by the South Plains Public Health District, which includes Gaines County, there have been at least 95 measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations, according to Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, CNN reported. The clinic is currently operating with expanded hours and is now open seven days a week for vaccinations.",
