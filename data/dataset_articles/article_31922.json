The outbreak reduced the number of laying hens in Australia, which unfortunately will take a while longer to rebuild,\" the spokesperson said. \"In the meantime, the egg industry is working to boost supply marketwide. \"The usual higher demand for eggs over Christmas and the New Year's period put an additional short-term strain on the availability of eggs across all retailers, however our supply remains stable. \"Our egg supply has continued to improve and we are working closely with our suppliers to source as many eggs as possible.\" Egg Farmers of Australia chief executive Melinda Hashimoto told 9news.com.au last month, that there is a national shortage.

Control orders remain in place restricting the movement of poultry, poultry products, equipment, and vehicles on or off properties in designated zones.

The zones include a restricted area covering a 5km radius around the farms, with a broader control area spanning east of the Goulburn Valley Freeway and including the townships of Euroa, Violet Town, Longwood, Ruffy, Avenel and Strathbogie. \"If you are in the control or restricted areas, you cannot move birds, products (including eggs and manure) or equipment into, out of, or within the area without permit,\" Bell said. \"This includes selling or giving away eggs from your poultry – these must not leave your property.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
