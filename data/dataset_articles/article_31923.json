  "text": "REDDING, Calif. — A significant increase in flu cases has been reported in the Northstate this year, with Shasta Regional Medical Center seeing more than twice the number of positive tests compared to the same period last year.\n\"Last year we saw a 5.6% positivity rate for influenza infections; this year we are seeing 11.1%, which is double what we saw last year,\" said Dr. Morris Jones, laboratory director at Shasta Regional Medical Center.\nChief Nursing Officer Brian Bradley suggested that the increase might be partly due to people letting their guard down post-pandemic. \"We are seeing double what we saw last year this time. In fact, our year-to-date last year versus today is double. So, with two months to go in the flu season, we will end up seeing many more flu cases this year than we did last year,\" Bradley said.\nWhen asked about the reasons behind the surge, Bradley said they are not entirely sure but noted that people are more active post-COVID, emphasizing the need for precautions every flu season. He added that the severity of flu cases varies, with some being mild and others requiring hospitalization.\nDr. Jones advised that it is never too late to get a flu shot, as the flu is always present. The vaccine has about a 35% efficacy rate, which is average. He noted that the spike in cases is not surprising, as flu season runs from October 1 through April 30, leaving more than two months remaining in the season.",
