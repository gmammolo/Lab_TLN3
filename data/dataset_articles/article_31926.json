  "text": "Thursday, February 20th, 2025 By Mike Kelly (File Photo) Share\nFacebook Twitter WhatsApp ReddIt Email Copy URL Put down the nugget!\nIf you’ve got a box of Swiss Chalet Chicken Breast Nuggets in your freezer, you might want to hit pause before popping them in the oven.\nA nationwide recall has been issued after reports of injuries linked to pieces of bone found in the product.\nOn February 19th, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) put out a warning about the recall, which was prompted by multiple complaints from consumers. Food processing company Olymel confirmed that affected nuggets contain “extraneous material”—aka unexpected bits of bone.\nDetails of the recall:\nBrand: Swiss Chalet Product: Chicken Breast Nuggets (Frozen) Size: 700 g UPC: 066701011479 Best-before dates: BB 2025 SE 07 and BB 2025 SE 26\nThe nuggets have been pulled from shelves across Canada, but if you already have a box, don’t eat them!\nThe CFIA says you should either toss them out or return them to the store where you bought them. And no, you cannot sell, share, or redistribute recalled food—it’s against the law.\nThe agency hasn’t said how many injuries have been reported or exactly how many packages are affected, but they’re investigating further. More recalls could be on the way if other products are found to have the same issue.\nThis recall has been classified as Class 2, meaning there’s a moderate health risk—enough to be cautious, but not necessarily life-threatening.\nMike Kelly Founder of Victoria Buzz, Vancouver Island's fastest-growing local media outlet.
