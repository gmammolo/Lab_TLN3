  "text": "Chemical accident results in shelter-in-place orders for three-block T.O. neighborhood By TO Acorn Staff on February 21, 2025\nHAZMAT—First responders, including the Ventura County Fire Department’s hazardous materials units, responded Feb. 12 to a chemical accident in Thousand Oaks. Courtesy Ventura County Fire Department\nResidents in a Thousand Oaks neighborhood were asked to shelter in place last week as authorities responded to a hazardous materials incident the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office is describing as an accident involving readily available chemicals.\nAt around 5:15 p.m. Feb. 12, Ventura County firefighters responded to the area of Calle Avallano and Calle Olivo to help a person injured in a chemical reaction. By the time they arrived, the minor involved had already been taken to Los Robles Regional Medical Center, said Ventura County Fire Department public information officer Andrew Dowd.\nBecause the responding units had not yet determined the nature of the chemicals involved, the department sent a hazardous materials unit to the hospital and issued a shelter-in-place order for a three-block area of the neighborhood, located just north of Avenida de los Arboles and west of the 23 Freeway.\n“We did that as a precaution until we were able to rule out any danger to the community,” Dowd said. “Rescuer safety, public safety and environmental safety are paramount to what we do.”\nOnce the VCFD team was able to establish the home was safe for Ventura County Sheriff officers to enter, the fire department handed the investigation over, Dowd said.\nThe sheriff’s office has since determined the mixing of the involved materials— which VCSO said can be purchased online or in a store—was accidental.\nThe Sheriff’s department is not naming the materials.\n— Becca Whitnall",
