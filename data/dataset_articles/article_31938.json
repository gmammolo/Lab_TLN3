  "text": "NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (WPRI) — The Buttonwood Park Zoo is mourning the loss of Blue , a harbor seal that died from the bird flu earlier this month. Shara Rapoza, acting director of Buttonwood Park Zoo, described Blue as being a fixture. “He was a ham, he really was,” Rapoza said. “He was just a good boy.” Buttonwood Park Zoo closed for a day after Blue’s passing to allow staff to grieve the sudden loss. Blue was 21 years old when he died, though harbor seals can live to be upwards of 30 years old. “This was an animal that I consider to have been in the prime of his life,” Rapoza said. “This was just devastating to the staff, and completely unexpected.” Rapoza said the zoo has been taking steps to protect its residents against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), more commonly known as the bird flu, for years. The virus is currently widespread in Massachusetts, according to the Division of Fish and Wildlife. “We already had foot baths in place,” Rapoza explained. “[Staff] also change out their foot gear when they go into any enclosure. Tools, dishes, things like that, are all specific to individual enclosures.” The zoo isn’t sure how Blue contracted the bird flu, but believe he likely came into contact with an infected wild bird. Rapoza said the zoo is now taking extra precautions to protect the zoo’s inhabitants, including Blue’s companions seals Luna and Conway. “We’re not allowing the feeding of ducks anymore,” Rapoza noted. Shira Doron, the chief infection control officer for Tufts Medicine, told 12 News that Blue isn’t the first seal to contract this virus. “We have seen seals die of bird flu in the wild, so this is not totally unexpected,” Doron said. According to Doron, humans are at risk of catching the bird flu when they are in close contact with an infected animal. “I wouldn’t expect it to be an issue at any zoo,” she continued. “Except when you’re talking about a petting zoo type of situation.” Thanks for signing up!
