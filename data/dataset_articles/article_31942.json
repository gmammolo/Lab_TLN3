JONES,\n2 hours agoA patient in Mission Hospital’s emergency room died in the bathroom last week after calling for help but getting no immediate response. Hospital spokeswoman Nancy Lindell confirmed the incident to Asheville Watchdog on Thursday and said one employee has been fired and more action may be taken in an ongoing investigation. But several ER nurses contend that the department was crowded and understaffed that evening, with no rooms available when the patient arrived.\n8",
