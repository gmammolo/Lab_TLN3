  "text": "Aside from this week’s showers in Islamabad-Rawalpindi and Lahore, it has not rained much for about four months. This lack of rain is already having an adverse impact on our agricultural sector and, consequently, our food reserves.\nDue to lack of rain, there has also been a shortage of clean water, calling for the implementation of water conservation policies. While the country cannot do much about the lack of rain, we can take steps to mitigate the damage from drought and adapt to increasing climate difficulties.\nMuhammad Murtaza Khan\nRawalpindi",
