  "text": "{p}A Dillon woman has been indicted for healthcare fraud. {/p}{p}Federal court records show Tina Armstrong operated Safe at Home Medical Equipment and Supplies (SHME) LLC in Dillon, a designated provider of Medicaid and Medicare in South Carolina.{/p}{p}Court documents show Armstrong, from about January 2021 until January 2024, fraudulently submitted claims for Medicare payment for patients that \"did not have\" durable medial equipment (DME) \"or continued to bill for equipment beyond the allowed period\" {/p}{p}A portion of the complaint reads:{/p}{blockquote}\"In some instances, after the thirty-six-month rental period ended for oxygen equipment with a five-year useful lifetime, TINA ARMSTRONG, through SHME, submitted claims for the period immediately following the thirty-sixth month. Several were denied payment. After a break of several months, TINA ARMSTRONG, through SHME, submitted claims which were paid; however, the service dates were still within the five-year useful lifetime of the equipment.{/blockquote}{blockquote}In some instances, TINA ARMSTRONG, through SHME, submitted claims many months after the dates of service indicated on the claims and SHE was unable to provide supporting records that the beneficiaries had the DME. In some instances, TINA ARMSTRONG, through SHME, submitted claims after beneficiaries had died for periods the beneficiary did not have the equipment or for periods which SHME had already been paid.{/blockquote}{p}Prosecutors say Armstrong used the fraudulently begotten money to \"unlawfully enrich herself,\" alleging she netted $82,383.90\" {/p}{p}The complaint does not list an attorney for Armstrong. She is scheduled to appear in federal court on the complaint next month.{/p}\",\"readAloud\":null,\"isReadAloudChecked\":true,\"derivedImages\":{\"externalId\":\"9bcb16fd-53fe-4937-a7fd-fbae76e658d7\",\"heroImageFromPackageMedia\":{\"type\":\"Image\",\"uuid\":\"cf307f7d-0042-40f2-82bf-4d31b759f354\",\"title\":\"Dillon healthcare fraud\",\"updatedBy\":\"Elizabeth Thomas\",\"created\":1740088997000,\"version\":8,\"caption\":\"FILE -{ }Tina Armstrong is indicted of healthcare fraud for{ }fraudulently submitting and causing \"submitted claims to Medicare Part B and South Carolina Medicaid for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) that beneficiaries did not have or continued to bill for equipment beyond the allowed period for the equipment.\"{ } According to a new study by Florida Attorneys, South Carolina ranks first as having the most negligent mental health practitioners.
