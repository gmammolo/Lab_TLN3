  "text": "Older adults using home healthcare and living in disadvantaged rural neighborhoods experience more infection-related hospitalizations compared to older adults using home health in urban settings, a new study shows.\nAuthors of the study say policymakers should invest more in rural health infrastructure, improve telehealth, enhance transportation and give more incentives for clinicians to practice in the rural areas.\nThe report00878-8/abstract) was published on Feb. 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Directors Association. A team led by Jingjing Shang, PhD, a professor at Columbia Nursing, evaluated multiple data sets including Medicare data linked to 2019 Area Deprivation Index (ADI) data and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. Data came from 3,656,810 people utilizing home health and 8,135 home health agencies.\nRural areas with higher ADI rankings had lower quality and worse healthcare resources compared to those with less deprivation. Higher deprivation was linked with higher infection risks, but only in rural areas and not in urban regions, the data showed.\nData showed an increase in the proportion of dual-eligible, female, Black and Hispanic patients in neighborhoods that were more deprived, and fewer white people in those areas. Results were more especially pronounced in rural areas.\n“In disadvantaged rural neighborhoods, residents often face challenges like long distances to healthcare, transportation, workforce shortages, costs, and privacy concerns, which may delay timely infection management in home healthcare settings and increase hospitalizations,” Shang said in a statement. “Our findings demonstrate how crucial neighborhood characteristics are in developing strategies and interventions to address resource gaps and health disparities.”\nIn related news, a study published last year in the Journal of Rural Health found that veterans who live in rural areas are more likely to use home health services than those who live in urban areas. But the veterans often receive far fewer visits than veterans living in urban regions. Compared with veterans living in urban areas, rural veterans received 24% fewer home health visits in 2019 on average, 38% fewer visits in 2020, and 36% fewer visits in 2021, according to the study.",
