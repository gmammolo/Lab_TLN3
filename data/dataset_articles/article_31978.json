  "text": "Canada rocked with bad injury news just moments before puck drop\nThomas Harley will draw into the lineup in replacement.\nThis just in, Team Canada defenseman Josh Morrissey will NOT play this evening against USA in the 4 Nations Face-Off Final due to an illness. Thomas Harley will draw into the lineup as his replacement.\nRead below for our earlier lineup reports, published this morning.\nThis just in, Canadian head coach Jon Cooper confirmed to media this morning that he'll be making a lineup change for tonight's 4 Nations Face-Off Final.\nOut is forward Travis Konecny, replaced by forward Seth Jarvis.\nJarvis tells NHL insider Chris Johnston that he found out the news this morning and that he considers tonight, \"probably the biggest game of my hockey career.\"\nSo, assuming Canada doesn't make any other changes, here's how the team should line up:\nIncidentally, Team USA head coach Mike Sullivan has confirmed that everyone on his roster, save for defenseman Charlie McAvoy, is available for tonight's game against Canada.\nThis means, presumably, that forwards Brady Tkachuk, Matthew Tkachuk and Auston Matthews are all healthy enough to play and will suit up this evening.\nHere's how the Americans are expected to line up this evening:\nRead below for our earlier report on Brady Tkachuk, published this morning.\nWhile it was reported earlier this week that brothers Matthew and Brady Tkachuk are expected to play in the 4 Nations Finale this evening, the team has yet to confirm the news.\nIncidentally, the Americans also kept captain Auston Matthews, forward Matthew Tkachuk and goaltender Connor Hellebuyck out of the lineup against Sweden for precautionary reasons, while forward Brady Tkachuk left the game after colliding with the Swedish goal.\nYesterday Brady Tkachuk missed practice with the team after suffering an apparent injury while colliding with team Sweden's goal on Tuesday evening.\nThe younger Tkachuk left the game and did not return, but head coach Mike Sullivan said post-game that Tkachuk was held out again for \"precautionary reasons.\"\nToday though, Brady was back on the ice with his team giving us all an indication that he'll be in the lineup tonight against Team Canada.\nGiddy up!\nLet's drop the puck on this game already!",
