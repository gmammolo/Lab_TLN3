  "text": "Skilled nursing providers remained stoic this week about a potential Medicaid payment hit even as House leaders prepare to vote on a bill calling for at least $1.5 trillion in federal spending cuts.\nThe Senate and House are drafting separate budget resolutions, with Republicans tasking the House committee that oversees Medicaid with trimming $880 billion in costs over a decade as part of the larger spending reduction effort. Given strong “hands-off” messaging on Medicare and Social Security coming from the White House, experts have said major Medicaid cuts would undoubtedly have to be on the table.\nBut that debate could be on hold if Senate leaders get their way and delay the debate on Medicaid. The popular safety-net insurance plan covers more than 72 million Americans and the majority of nursing home care in the US.\nWhile House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Wednesday that the House will vote on a one-bill solution next week, Senate Republicans are pushing a two-bill proposal that would deal with deeper cuts later.\nThe split approach, according to Roll Call, would first help pay for enhanced immigration enforcement by axing the nursing home staffing mandate — which was projected to cost the federal government $22 billion over a decade, according to a Congressional Budget Office report last summer.\nThe CBO estimate doesn’t break down those costs, and it’s unclear what they are related to, given that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rule puts the bulk of costs on providers and actually called for Medicare savings of $318 million annually starting in the rule’s third year.\nSkilled nursing experts contacted by McKnight’s Long-Term Care News Thursday could not explain the discrepancy.\nIn any case, nixing the staffing mandate would be viewed as a win for the nursing home sector.\nBut even if it’s pushed off for now, budget-related pain almost certainly would come later in the form of Medicaid cuts that could cap federal spending for the program or create block grants. Or force states to roll back expansion or make tough choices about how well they reimburse nursing homes and other providers.\nImplications for Medicaid pay\nLong-term care organizations, caregivers and patients joined together on a Protect Medicaid press call Thursday to discuss the possible implications of Medicaid cuts and their potential residual effects across healthcare sectors.\nMany lawmakers believe Medicaid cuts will not affect older adults because other, more expensive alternatives would be available to them, said Amber Christ, managing director of health advocacy at Justice and aging, during the Zoom call. But that view couldn’t be farther from the truth, she charged.\n“[Lawmakers] think that because seniors have Medicare, everything is covered. But Medicare has huge gaps in coverage — the biggest gap being coverage is for long-term care,” Christ said. “Medicaid is the only program paying for the assistance seniors need with daily activities such as eating, bathing, dressing and getting out of bed.\n“It is Medicaid, not Medicare, that is the primary payer of long term care in this country,” she reminded.\nMore than six in 10 nursing home residents rely on Medicaid to pay for their care, she explained.\nIn Pennsylvania, roughly 200 nursing home workers held a rally Thursday in support of sustaining federal Medicaid funding. The state’s bed count continues to decline with many operators citing low reimbursement rates as a major concern.\n“We should be expanding Medicaid, not cutting it,” said Matt Yarnell, president of SEIU HCPA. “That’s why we are anxious to work with responsible owners, to defend what we all need. We must come together — owners and operators, elected leaders, workers, community members — to elevate care.”\nAdministration intent questioned\nPresident Trump has made the budget task even tougher for Congress by recently vowing not to cut Medicaid. On Tuesday, he told Fox News that Medicaid is “going to be strengthened — but won’t be touched [in the budget-process]. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched.”\n“Now, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we’re going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud,” Trump added, according to a White House transcript of the show.\nThat has led others to warn that lawmakers or the Department of Government Efficiency might try to disguise Medicaid cuts as reform or use other disingenuous tactics.\n“In the coming fight about Medicaid, large swaths of Medicaid spending will be relabeled ‘fraud,’ just as all kinds of federal health programs have been labeled ‘DEI’ to cut them,” KFF President and CEO Drew Altman said on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday.\nProviders remain skeptical\nThe Senate is working to vote on its first budget bill this week. The House is in recess, but leaders have pledged a vote when it returns to business next week.\nStill, several high-profile skilled nursing executives have argued on earnings calls that massive Medicaid cuts are unlikely, especially given Republicans’ slim majority.\nOn Thursday, Sabra REIT’s Rick Matros said the two chambers being so far apart on how to address Medicaid — if at all right now — is likely a good sign. He predicted a cut somewhere under $1 trillion would not impact nursing homes, but rather home- and community-based services, expanded coverage for people under 65 and even the Children’s Health Insurance Program before seniors.\n“I’m more optimistic than pessimistic about Medicaid, or certainly the overall impact of [cuts],” Matros said. “We’re living in a time that’s completely unpredictable. So I tend to fall back on the bipartisan support, the lobbying efforts, the fact that this stuff is statutory and you’ve got states involved as well as both chambers of Congress. It’s just not going to be that simple to hurt people who are most dependent on government aid.”\nBut others have said that getting the $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in cuts needed to offset the cost of extending expiring tax cuts and paying for the administration’s new priorities will be nearly impossible without impacting any of the entitlement programs.\n“I appreciate the president’s comments … reaffirming his commitment to not cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, but I still need some clarity from my colleagues in the House on how we’re gonna get to the numbers mandated in the resolution without cutting Medicaid in a way that it impacts beneficiaries or my hospitals,” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) told The Hill this week.",
