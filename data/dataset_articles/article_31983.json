  "text": "Share\nPeople in their late teens and early 20s may be more sensitive to nicotine and more susceptible to nicotine addiction than middle-aged adults.\nResults the study led by researchers in the Penn State Department of Biobehavioural Health in the United States,are published in the journal Behavioral Pharmacology.\nThe results provide evidence that the effects of drugs on the body—both medication and misused substances—change over the lifespan in ways that clinicians and researchers need to consider when developing and prescribing treatments, the researchers said.\nDoctoral student Carlos Novoa and his adviser, Thomas Gould, Jean Phillips Shibley Professor of Biobehavioural Health and head of the department, led the study.\nThe researchers demonstrated that nicotine lowers the body temperature of young-adult mice more quickly and reduces their movement more significantly than middle-aged mice.\nThese results indicate how the effects of nicotine change as people age, according to the research team.\nGould’s prior research has illustrated the differential effects of nicotine in children, adolescents and young adults.\nShare",
