  "text": "Local\n‘An evolving situation.’ Tacoma hospital on generator power after damage from burst pipe\nA burst pipe has placed a Tacoma hospital on generator power as well as knocking out some equipment.\nScott Thompson, media representative for MultiCare health system, told The News Tribune in response to questions that the incident occurred Wednesday at Tacoma General Hospital, 315 MLK Jr. Way.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the hospital was still on generator power.\nWhile the incident “did damage electrical equipment,” according to Thompson, “We do have functioning MRI and CT machines. So we are using those for patients.”\nHe noted that some surgeries have been transferred and elective procedures canceled.\n“We’re working to get power restored later tonight,” Thompson added. “This is an evolving situation.”\nNo further details were immediately available.\nThis story was originally published February 20, 2025 at 4:29 PM.",
