  "text": "Lolit Solis suffered an anxiety attack during her hospitalization\n• Lolit Solis shared on Instagram that she had an anxiety attack while confined at FEU Hospital\nPAY ATTENTION: stay informed and follow us on Google News!\n• She described waking up disoriented and emotionally overwhelmed by the unfamiliar hospital setting\n• Despite feeling weak and helpless, she expressed gratitude for the caring staff and doctors at the hospital\n• The talent manager reflected on the experience as an eye-opener and remains hopeful for recovery so she can return to the life she loves\nVeteran showbiz columnist and talent manager Lolit Solis took to Instagram to open up about her recent hospitalization at FEU Hospital, where she experienced an anxiety attack—something she admitted came as a shock at her age.\nPAY ATTENTION: Follow us on Instagram - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!\n“Talagang hindi ko akalain at my age dun pa ako mako-confined at magkakasakit. Nagkaruon nga tuloy ako ng anxiety attack dahil hindi ko akalain na at my age mahihiga ako sa hospital bed,” Lolit wrote candidly.\nShe described waking up each morning disoriented, confused by the unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital room. “Every time I wake up in the morning, shock ako na nasa ibang kuwarto ako… parang at a lost ako tuwing gigising. Pag umaga parang hinahanap ko ‘yung magulong kuwarto ko,” she shared.\nThe well-known entertainment personality admitted she had never been used to hospital scenarios, and the experience felt like a cultural shock. “Ang hirap pala ng maysakit. Hopeless, helpless, weak ka. Para bang hindi mo alam where and what to do,” she wrote, adding that she even felt like crying at times.\nDespite the emotional toll, Lolit found comfort and gratitude in the care she received from FEU Hospital staff, calling them “spoiling” and deeply attentive. “SALAMAT sa staffs ng FEU Hospital dahil napaka caring nila… Talagang spoiled patient ang feeling ko,” she expressed.\nReflecting on her situation with spiritual acceptance, she said: “Pero alam mo naman si GOD, alam niya when or where ibibigay sa iyo ang mga bagay. So grateful na ngayon older na ako nangyari ito. Meron na ako ng pasensiya at wisdom na tanggapin mga bagay.”\nLolit ended her post on a hopeful note, expressing her desire to recover and return to the life and work she loves:\n“Wishing na sana gumaling ako agad at maging active uli. I love life. I love my works. I love my friends.”\nLolit Solis is a well-known personality in the Philippine showbiz industry. Born on May 20, 1947, in Sampaloc, Manila, she started her career as an entertainment news writer and later became a talent manager and host of television talk shows.\nIn another report, Manay Lolit expressed disappointment over the partial senatorial election results, particularly Bong Revilla’s low ranking. She was alarmed by the number of votes Willie Revillame received and said she couldn’t accept the idea of him becoming a senator. Solis claimed that electing someone like Revillame would make the elections feel like a comedy and even called it a bad dream. The columnist urged voters to be wise and to choose the best leaders as a reflection of trust in those who will run the country.\nPreviously, the veteran columnist posted a heartfelt birthday message for Lani Mercado, who turned 57 on April 13. She praised Lani’s strength, loyalty, and her role as the legal wife of Senator Bong Revilla despite his child outside their marriage. The showbiz columnist emphasized the value of being the legitimate wife and highlighted Lani’s dignity and grace through personal challenges. Lastly, Lolit expressed pride in Lani’s children and called her a loyal, unchanged, and admirable woman through the years.\nBagong feature: Tingnan ang mga balitang para sa'yo ➡️ hanapin ang \"Recommended for you\" block at mag-enjoy!\nSource: KAMI.com.gh",
