  "text": "Texas\nThe Surprising Firework That Sends the Most People to the ER In Texas\nBy Wes,\n3 hours agoI certainly don't want to put a damper on your 4th of July activities—I just want to give you a heads-up that some things aren't as harmless as they seem. You’ll get no preaching about fireworks from me. I’ve probably done every bad thing you can do with fireworks, so I don’t have much room to talk. And I’m not here to lecture you about stuff you’d rather ignore. Let's just protect Texas kids.",
