  "text": "West Midlands based Acorns Children's Hospice call for long-term funding guarantee from government\nThe hospice says it fears it may be forced to turn away a child needing their care for the first time in its 37-year history without it\nA West Midlands children’s hospice is calling on the Government to guarantee its long-term funding to help it to be able to plan for the future.\nAcorns Children's Hospice, who have three facilities based in Birmingham, Walsall and Worcester, says without it, it fears it may be forced to turn away a child that needs their care for the first time in its 37-year history.\nIn December 2024, the Government announced £100 million of funding would help hospices this year and next to provide \"the best end of life care to patients and their families in a supportive and dignified physical environment.\"\nIt also added hospices for children and young people would also receive a further £26 million revenue funding for 2025/26 through what was known up until recently as the Children’s Hospice Grant.\n£2.2 million of that £26 million was given to Acorns, but the hospice says the grant runs out in eight months time and there's no indication it will continue beyond March 2026.\nChief executive of Acorns Trevor Johnson says the Government need to extend the grant beyond its current period but also commit to longer term funding, as short-term ones are a real worry for them.\n\"We genuinely are concerned that for the first time in over 35 years we would have to turn a child away because we couldn't afford to care for them,\" Trevor said.\n\"That decision made in December was one we were very grateful for and made a big difference to us, it built us a platform to be able to continue to be there but it was only a short-term decision.\n\"It prevents us being able to make decisions that are right for the children and families long-term, we need to know what funding we've got coming in so that we can make plans and we've got this money until the end of March, but after that we don't know where we are and we need to make decisions right now.\"\nTo highlight their call, a portrait of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been made using hundreds of orange handprints of children cared for by Acorns Children’s Hospice.\nThe artwork titled ‘Hands for Hope’ was put on display outside the Houses of Parliament and in locations around central London.\nIn February the Government said hospices would receive a multi-million pound boost to improve facilities, releasing £25 million for upgrades and refurbishments for hospices across England.\nAn additional £75 million was also made available from April to modernise facilities, improve IT systems and ensure patients receive the highest quality care.\nOn the announcement at the time, minister for care Stephen Kinnock said: \"This is the largest investment in a generation to help transform hospice facilities across England.\n\"From upgrading patient rooms to improving gardens and outdoor spaces, this funding will make a real difference to people at the end of their lives.\n\"Hospices provide invaluable care and support when people need it most and this funding boost will ensure they are able to continue delivering exceptional care in better, modernised facilities.\"\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
