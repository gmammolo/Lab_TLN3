  "text": "15% of people in West Midlands have had a drink spiked, stats reveal\n6.6 million Brits have been spiked during their lifetime\n15% of people in the West Midlands have had a drink spiked before, stats have revealed.\nOf these, 51% said that they were spiked in a nightclub, 29% at a pub, 19% at a private party, 5% at a festival, and 5% at a work event, according to the anti-spiking organisation CounterSpike.\nIt also found 6.6 million Brits have been spiked during their lifetime, and a further 11.7 million know someone who has been a victim of spiking.\n\"These are huge numbers and I don't think it's getting any less,\" said Mark Ackred, founder of CounterSpike.\nMark was spiked at a family festival while looking after his children.\nHe said he thinks the nature of spiking has evolved.\n\"My view is that over time it's gone from people thinking it's funny to being more serious.\n\"I think there are a lot of people who do it who don't necessarily know the consequences,\" he said.\nThe research by CounterSpike also showed over half (56%) of those who have been spiked felt ‘safe’ before it happened. Around the same (52%) say they feel the drinks spiking epidemic is on the rise, just as the UK festival season begins and young people attend post school and university exam parties.\nIt also found the majority (85%) of adults think people are likely to get spiked in a nightclub, 52% at a festival and 50% at a pub.\nBut, according to CounterSpike, 35% say that they have been spiked in a nightclub, 30% in a pub and only 8% at a festival.\nMike said the gender split might also surprise people.\n\"Even more men are being spiked than before, which is for robbery, as well as other factors,\" he said.\n\"Because it's so easy to pull someone's phone out of their pocket after they've been spiked, hold it over their face to open their phone, and then you've got access to their bank accounts.\"\nThe organisation also asked people what would make them feel safer from the risks of spiking.\n45% said more obvious CCTV inside venues, 38% said anti-spiking tests at the bar, and 25% said shelves in toilets for drinks.\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
