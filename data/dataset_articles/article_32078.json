Despite Denmark ‘s long-term eradication efforts, initiated in 2008, the bacterium continues to circulate, causing notable losses for farmers and presenting a potential risk to human health. While most associate salmonella with poultry, this specific strain poses a unique and growing threat to cattle globally.\nUnderstanding Salmonella Dublin : A Silent Epidemic Salmonella Dublin is a notably virulent form of the bacteria, capable of causing severe illness – pneumonia and blood poisoning – in cattle, leading to ample calf and cow mortality. Globally, the prevalence of this disease is increasing. Currently, approximately 18% of cattle herds in the united States are infected, a figure that rises dramatically to around 60%",
