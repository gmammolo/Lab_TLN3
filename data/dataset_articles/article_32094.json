  "text": "In Hassan, worry has gripped families after 23 people died from heart attacks in only 40 days. Many victims were young or middle-aged. Some were students, others were workers like the 27-year-old woodworker who died last Tuesday. The data paints a bleak picture—between 28 May and 29 June, the deaths covered all age groups, from teenagers to senior citizens.Jayadeva Hospital in Bengaluru has seen an 8% jump in heart patients in two weeks. Most arrive from Hassan and nearby areas. District Health data shows 507 heart attacks were recorded in Hassan in two years. Of these, 190 people could not be saved.CM points finger at Covid vaccineThe sharp rise has pushed the Karnataka government into action. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has formed a special committee. Dr Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, will lead it. The panel must submit its findings in ten days.But Siddaramaiah stirred debate by pointing at Covid jabs. On X, he wrote, “Orders were given to this same committee back in February to conduct a thorough study on the reasons behind sudden deaths among young people in the state, and whether the Covid vaccines could have any adverse effects.”He added, “It cannot be denied that the hasty approval and distribution of the Covid vaccine to the public could also be a reason for these deaths, as several studies worldwide have recently indicated that Covid vaccines could be a cause for the increasing number of heart attacks.”Health Minister asks public not to panicHealth Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao urged people to stay calm while the probe continues. He told News18, “Once we get the report, we will be able to speak with greater clarity. These are matters that must be properly investigated. Speculation at this stage could cause unnecessary alarm.”Centre stands firm on vaccine safetyThe Union Health Ministry stepped in quickly. It said on Tuesday there is no evidence to back claims that Covid vaccines cause sudden deaths. It pointed to studies by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). In its statement, the ministry said, “The matter of sudden unexplained deaths has been investigated through several agencies in the country. These studies have conclusively established that there is no direct link between Covid 19 vaccination and the reports of sudden deaths in the country.”Two major studies say no linkICMR ran a nationwide study from May to August 2023. It checked cases in 47 hospitals across 19 states and union territories. Researchers tracked sudden deaths of healthy-looking young adults from October 2021 to March 2023. They found no rise due to vaccines.AIIMS, New Delhi, with ICMR’s support, is conducting another study. Early results show the leading cause remains heart attacks and other health conditions, not vaccines. The ministry stressed, “Studies by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) affirm that Covid-19 vaccines in India are safe and effective, with extremely rare instances of serious side effects. Sudden cardiac deaths can result from a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-Covid complications.”Experts warn against vaccine fearThe Health Ministry warned, “Spreading such claims without proper evidence is harmful. Vaccines saved millions of lives during the pandemic. Such false claims can damage trust in vaccines.”Medical experts too say panic over vaccines could stop people from getting important shots.Doctors say lifestyle plays a big role. Many young professionals work long hours with little rest. The issue is bigger than Hassan. For example, Infosys recently warned staff against working more than 9 hours and 15 minutes a day for five days a week. The IT giant’s note counters co-founder Narayana Murthy’s controversial pitch for a 70-hour work week. The company wants staff to avoid burnout, as long hours can silently raise heart risks.Back in Hassan, families wait for clarity. The expert panel will file its report within days. Until then, doctors ask people to watch for chest pain, breathlessness, or sudden fatigue. Siddaramaiah posted, “We have formed a committee led by Dr Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. They have been asked to study the situation and give a report within 10 days.”Hassan watches. So does the rest of Karnataka.",
