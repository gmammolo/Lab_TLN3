  "text": "Dodgersâ€™ Max Muncy Leaves Game With Devastating Knee Injury\nDuring Clayton Kershaw's achievement of 3,000 career strikeouts, Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy suffered what looked like a very serious knee injury.\nWith the Dodgers down 4-2 in the sixth inning, Muncy crumpled to the ground after successfully tagging White Sox outfielder Michael A. Taylor out at third base on an attempted steal.\nMuncy immediately grabbed his knee and was down on the ground for several minutes before being helped off the field. Shortly after Muncy left the game, Kershaw struck out Chicago third baseman Vinny Capra for his monumental strikeout.\nAs different angles of the injury have been released, it appears as if Muncy severely hyperextended his knee.\nWhat is Max Muncy's Injury?\nA conclusive diagnosis on Muncy's knee has not been given, and likely won't be known until testing has been done in an official capacity. Having said that, the Dodgers are calling Muncy's injury \"left knee pain\".\nMore news:Â Dodgers' Tyler Glasnow Won't Return As Soon As Team Hoped\nFor more Dodgers news, head over toÂ Dodgers on SI.",
