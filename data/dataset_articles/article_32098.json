The death toll could rise as the survival of the missing people after more than 48 hours of disaster is getting dim.\nA total of 157 people have been housed in five relief camps, the HP State Emergency Operation Centre said.\nChief Minister Sukhvinder Sukhu on Wednesday visited Syathi village, which is located in the Laungani panchayat in Dharampur in Mandi, where he met families affected by a cloudburst, listened to their woes, shared grief and also reviewed relief and rehabilitation operations.\nThe district administration has provided assistance of Rs 1.70 lakh as financial aid, ration, tarpaulins and other relief material to each household.\nSpeaking to the affected families, the Chief Minister said the government stands firmly with all the affected and assured them of all possible assistance.\nRecalling the frightening incident, villagers narrated their sorrows and said that the entire village was swept away all of a sudden, and they now do not have a place left to pitch even the tents for shelter.\n“Many of us narrowly escaped death and were eyewitnesses to the horrifying incident,” a local resident told the Chief Minister.\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor\nOpen in app",
