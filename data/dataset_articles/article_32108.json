  "text": "DOUGLAS COUNTY, Ore. — Firefighters with Umpqua National Forest are responding to two new fires on the Diamond Lake District.\nUNF says a widespread lightning storm moved through the region the last two nights and multiple strikes have been confirmed on the forest.\nUNF's initial attack on the fire began just before 1 p.m. Wednesday.\nA fixed wing \"Air Attack\" plane is up and performing reconnaissance to locate any additional fires and an Incident Awareness and Assessment (IAA) imagery flight will take place across the area later Wednesday, UNF says.\nSmoke reports can be reported to Roseburg Interagency Communications Center at (541) 957-3325.\nFire Restriction Information\nPlease do your part to reduce the number of human-caused wildfires. Remember that even fires in Forest constructed fire rings within designated recreation sites, need to be dead out before leaving your campsite. Drown, stir, and feel your campfire with the back of your hand. It should feel cold to the touch before leaving your campsite.",
