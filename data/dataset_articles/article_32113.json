  "text": "HYDERABAD: Rice may be the comfort food in Telangana, but it's also quietly contributing to a calorie overload. In 2023-24, Telangana topped the nation in urban per capita calorie intake, with residents consuming an average of 2,455 calories a day. At the heart of this nutritional surge? A diet dominated by cereals-particularly rice-making up more than 43% of daily caloric intake, raising red flags for health experts. This revelation comes from the 'Nutritional Intake in India' report published by the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation. At first glance, it may seem like a sign of abundance. But dig a little deeper, and experts warn it's a dietary pattern skewed heavily towards carbohydrates, with over 43% of daily calories coming from cereals, especially rice. \"The issue isn't just about how much we eat-it's about what we eat,\" says Dr Shiva Raju, senior consultant physician and diabetologist at KIMS Hospitals. \"Obesity rates are rising across urban Telangana largely because of the over-dependence on rice. We need to rethink our food choices,\" Dr Raju said. The numbers speak for themselves. Urban Telangana residents, on average, consume 63.4 grams of ghee daily, and a staggering 70 grams statewide. While fats and oils add to overall calorie intake, it's the overconsumption of rice-often eaten in large, steaming servings-that's drawing concern from nutritionists. \"Calorie intake in Telangana isn't necessarily excessive,\" clarifies professor Avula Laxmaiah, retired scientist from the National Institute of Nutrition. \"But the quality of those calories is questionable,\" he says. Half of your diet must be veggies, fruit Ideally, half your plate should be vegetables and fruits, and the rest should be a mix of pulses and whole grains. Unfortunately, we’re seeing a dominance of cereals, which impacts long-term health,” Laxmaiah says. Telangana’s average urban intake even exceeds the sedentary threshold for both genders—signiﬁcantly so when much of it is coming from starchy carbohydrates than nutrient-rich food. Bihar follows closely behind Telangana with an urban calorie intake of 2,453 calories. Chhattisgarh is next at 2,366 calories. Yet, Telangana stands apart not just for its calorie numbers but for the high percentage of those calories coming from rice. Beyond weight issues, health professionals are seeing a rise in vitamin deﬁciencies—particularly B12 and B-complex vitamins—despite people believing they “eat enough.” “People think three rice meals a day equals a good diet, but that’s a myth,” Dr Raju adds. “Nutrients must be absorbed properly, especially in patients with diabetes or high blood pressure. Without balance, even full plates can lead to empty nutrition,” he says.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
