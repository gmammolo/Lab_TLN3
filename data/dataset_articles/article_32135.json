  "text": "Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star third baseman Max Muncy has exited Wednesday’s game early with a scary knee injury.\nMuncy tagged out Michael Taylor on a stolen base attempt, but Taylor slid into Muncy’s knee in a scary scene at Dodger Stadium.\nMuncy went down to the ground in immediate pain, and was agonizing in pain for a while before being helped off the field.\nHere’s a video of the injury:\nWishing Max Muncy the very best ? pic.twitter.com/WxxgUIzWrD\n— Dillard Barnhart (@BarnHasSpoken2) July 3, 2025 Muncy has completely turned around his season after a slow start, and has been arguably the team’s best hitter as of late. The last thing the team wants to see is Muncy on the shelf for significant time, so they’ll hope the injury isn’t as bad as it seems.\nShortly after Muncy exited the game, Clayton Kershaw recorded the 3,000th strikeout of his career , becoming the 20th player in MLB history to accomplish the feat.\nRead more: Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw Becomes 20th Pitcher in MLB History With 3,000 Strikeouts\nPhoto Credit: Gary A.
