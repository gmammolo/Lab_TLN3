  "text": "As a suburban hospital aims to eliminate labor and delivery services, a community is reacting with shock and outrage at the news.\nAscension Alexian Brothers Hospital in Elk Grove Village made the announcement this week, confirming that it will consolidate birthing services and establish a “dedicated labor and delivery center” approximately 10 miles away.\nStream NBC 5 for free, 24/7, wherever you are.\n WATCH HERE\nThat news was met with anger and frustration from the community, including one former staff member at the hospital.\n“It’s angering. It’s very angering,” Angela Filipi, a former nurse for Ascension, said. “Maternal mortality and morbidity is high regardless, especially high in Hispanic and Black populations. What are we doing to address that? We’re taking another resource away.”\nIn a statement, Ascension Illinois said it is being led by what is “best for its patients” and that this move would increase efficiency.\n“We are excited to establish Ascension Saint Alexius Women and Children’s Hospital in Hoffman Estates as a dedicated labor and delivery center of excellence for our northwest region as we work to ensure optimal patient outcomes, efficiency of resources and alignment with the needs of the communities we serve,” the group said in a statement.\nFilipi disputed that statement, arguing that the move would exacerbate disparities in health care.\n“What happens is when you close a unit like a labor and delivery unit you’re going to create further disparities,” she said. “You’re going to create bigger gaps in access to health care, especially for the underserved populations.”\nThe closure requires final approval from the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board. To that end, a protest is being planned Saturday expressing disagreement with the closure, according to organizers.\nFeeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the news you need to know with the Chicago Catch-Up newsletter.\n SIGN UP\nAccording to Ascension Alexian Brothers Hospital's website, the hospital's birthing center includes labor and delivery, pre and postpartum care, lactation and breastfeeding support, and 24/7 emergency OB care, along with perinatal services, maternal-fetal medicine and neonatal specialty care.\nIt wasn't immediately clear if all birthing services at the hospital were being eliminated. Ascension Illinois did not immediately respond to NBC Chicago's request for clarification.\nEarlier this year, Prime Healthcare acquired eight Ascension Hospitals in Illinois. Ascension Saint Alexius and Ascension Alexian Brothers were not part of the deal and remain owned by Ascension, a non-profit Catholic health system.",
