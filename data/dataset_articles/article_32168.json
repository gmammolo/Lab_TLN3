  "text": "Alix Earle says she “immediately regretted” her decision to get veneers. The influencer, 24, got real about her faux teeth in a Wednesday, July 2, TikTok video that explained why she did not acknowledge the cosmetic treatment after graduating college. “I never wanted to post about it, “ she revealed, “because I immediately felt like I regretted it. And I never want to, like, influence people to do something that I don’t think they should do.” She added that she never had braces growing up and in her senior year of high school, wore Invisalign devices to straighten her teeth. However, she recalled the treatment causing two of her front teeth to appear “shorter” than the rest. “So I did composite bonding,” she said, which added length to the teeth, but also made them fragile. To Veneer or Not to Veneer? Experts Talk Hollywood Smiles: From Aimee Lou Wood to Scarlett Johansson “So, like I’m an anxious person, and sometimes if I have a bad dream, I’ll bite my teeth in my sleep — and they would, like, crack off,” she explained. “It happened a lot, honestly.” In Earle’s senior year of college, she grew a large TikTok following and decided that it would be a good time to get veneers. She had wanted only two — to fix those problem teeth — but a dentist persuaded her to get 10 new teeth. Just a normal night ♬ original sound - Alix Earle “I don’t know, honestly, kind of emotional for me,” she admitted while holding back tears, recalling that she followed the dentist’s advice and “really regretted it. Like, right away. And I think it was really scary for me, and I was like, ‘What did I just do? And I had such good teeth and, I’m like, oh my God, I have to keep up with this for the rest of my life.’” Earle said her veneers look “really similar to my normal teeth, so I’m like, ‘Why did I even do that in the first place?’” Alix Earle Says Kendall Jenner Helped Her Come to Terms With Her ‘Acne Prone’ Skin She confessed, “I will say I don’t regret a lot, but it is something I really regret doing. At the end of the day, whatever. It was my decision, but I feel like it was kind of one of those decisions that was made pretty fast. And I just didn’t think it all the way through or, I think, talk to enough people.” Earle also revealed that she recently cracked a tooth while talking to Kate Hudson at a social event on the Ritz-Carlton cruise line. She was sipping a margarita out of a straw when the accident happened. Earle recalled that Hudson was “so, so sweet” about the mishap, adding, “Thank God for her, because otherwise I would’ve been alone, crying about my tooth.” In the TikTok, Earle showed herself filing down the tooth to make it smoother. Tori Spelling Shares Why She Got Veneers: ‘My Smile Used to Be My Thing When I Was Young’ The internet personality rose to fame through the platform in 2022. Us Weekly confirmed last month that she has a reality show in the works that will feature her and her relatives. “It will explore Alix traveling around the world for work and her family dynamic,” a source told Us at the time.",
