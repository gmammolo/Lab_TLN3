  "text": "A UK-based tennis coach, Simon Bowler, shared his experience with a rare symptom he encountered after consuming just a glass of wine, which led to the discovery of a severe form of skin cancer.\nBack in October 2023, Simon noticed an unusual reaction following his wine consumption, which was an early indicator of his later diagnosis.\nInitially, a lump on his neck was misdiagnosed by doctors as a benign cyst, but it turned out to be more serious.\nSimon’s cancer unfortunately progressed to his brain, necessitating a regimen of targeted radiotherapy aimed at eliminating it.\nBefore his diagnosis, an uncommon symptom emerged while Simon was enjoying a glass of wine.\nAt age 50, Simon realized that after drinking the wine, he felt intoxicated far quicker than he typically would, alongside other emerging symptoms.\n“I can usually drink a bottle of wine and not feel anything,” he recounted.\nOne evening, he also experienced a peculiar sensation described as ‘head fuzz,’ along with blurred vision and discovered a troubling neck lump.\nDespite being told it was a cyst, Simon advocated for further examination.\nDays later, he was contacted by his doctor while commuting to work.\n“He asked if I was sitting down. I told him I was driving, and he asked me to pull over,” Simon shared.\n“I knew it was bad news. He said they suspected cancer.”\nAdditional testing revealed that the cyst was actually melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, melanoma arises when melanocytes grow uncontrollably, making it a dangerous type due to its potential to spread if not promptly treated.\nSimon underwent surgery in February 2024 to remove the tumors and started immunotherapy.\nHowever, after nine months, similar symptoms reappeared.\n“To be honest, I didn’t feel right in my head. I started having blurred vision again, and I couldn’t switch off at night,” Simon stated.\nHe then found out that the cancer had metastasized to his brain, leading to a new round of targeted radiotherapy.\nSimon battled gastrointestinal issues and was unable to use the restroom, resulting in hospitalization. He described feeling ‘as though he’d been hit by a truck’ after facing nerve damage in his limbs due to high doses of steroids.\n“I felt numb, battered. It was like I’d been hit by a truck,” he expressed.\n“I’ve got wobbly legs now and a right hand that can barely grip a racket, let alone type. But I’m still trying.\n“That hospital stay nearly broke me. When I got home, I’d just burst into tears for days. It stripped away everything that felt like me.”\nCurrently, Simon has paused treatment and is consulting with his oncology team to determine future steps.\nA GoFundMe was established to assist Simon in rebuilding his life, and he intends to donate a portion of the funds to charity.\n“It’s OK to cry,” he remarked. “It’s OK to admit you’re not OK,” he added.\n“I’ve been stripped of a lot of my identity—but I haven’t lost my will to keep going.\n“I just want to get back to helping people, mentoring young players, and showing them what resilience looks like.”\nIf these issues have impacted you and you need someone to talk to confidentially, reach out to the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345 or use their live chat feature, available 24/7 every day of the year.",
