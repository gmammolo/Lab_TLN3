The heads of the affected schools have been directed to implement distance modular learning while containment, decontamination, and safety assessment procedures are being conducted. Psychosocial support services are being arranged for the affected learners and their families,” DepEd 6 added.\n(Courtesy: Province of Antique, DepEd Tayo Western Visayas)",
