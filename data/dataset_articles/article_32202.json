  "text": "Ground report: Pong Dam sports centre in urgent need of repairs\nThe 100-bed hostel at the Pong Dam Water Sports Centre is in dire need of repairs, raising concerns among staff, trainees and local authorities.\nEstablished in 1980 on 77 kanal of leased land from the Bhakra Beas Management Board, the centre has been a significant hub for water sports training over the years.\nDespite its importance, the condition of the hostel has severely deteriorated. The discoloured outer walls have lost their plaster and broken balconies, peeling plaster and structural damages now make the building resemble like relic of a bygone era. Staff and visitors alike have expressed concerns over its deteriorating state, which now urgently requires repairs.\nThe centre, run by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports, has been an important destination for training in kayaking, rowing, water safety, river rafting, sailing and more. It hosts a variety of water sports courses throughout the year, with trainees from the Army, Air Force, universities, and\nprivate organisations.\nUnlock Exclusive Insights with The Tribune Premium\nTake your experience further with Premium access.\nThought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nAlready a Member?
