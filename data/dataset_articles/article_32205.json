  "text": "Weather News\nThunderstorms with marble-sized hail in Upstate SC Wednesday – gusts as high as 40 mph\nThe creation of this content included the use of AI based on templates created, reviewed and edited by journalists in the newsroom. Read more on our AI policy here.\nA weather alert was issued by the NWS Greenville-Spartanburg SC on Wednesday at 11:50 p.m. for strong thunderstorms until Thursday at 12:15 a.m. The alert is for Abbeville, Laurens and Greenwood counties.\nWind gusts of up to 40 mph and marble-sized hail (0.5 inches) are anticipated.\n\"At 11:50 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm 14 miles southwest of Laurens, or near Ware Shoals, moving south at 15 mph,\" according to the NWS. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to outdoor objects is possible.\"\nLocations impacted by the alert include Ware Shoals, Donalds, Cokesbury, Hodges, Shoals Junction, Princeton and Hickory Tavern.\nThe NWS states, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building.\"\nThis alert is in effect until Thursday at 12:15 a.m.\nWhat to do as threat of lightning approaches?\nAround 25 million lightning strikes occur in the United States every year, with most taking place during the summer months. The NWS reports that these strikes result in about 20 fatalities annually. The probability of lightning strikes rises as a thunderstorm approaches and peaks when the storm is directly above. As the storm moves away, this likelihood decreases.\nHere are tips on how to stay safe during a thunderstorm:\n- To minimize risk of being struck by lightning, when going outside, have a plan to get to a safer place.\n- If the sky grows ominous and you hear thunder, seek out a safe place to take shelter.\n- Once inside, abstain from touching corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing, and windows and doors.\n- Wait for 30 minutes after the final lightning or thunder before heading outside again.\nIf finding indoor shelter is not an option:\n- Avoid open fields, hill peaks, or ridge tops.\n- Stay away from tall, isolated trees or other tall objects. If you are in a forest, stay near a lower stand of trees.\n- If you are with a group, fan out to stop the current from transmitting between members.\n- If you are camping in an open area, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low area. Remember, a tent offers no protection from lighting.\n- Do not approach water, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively.\nWhat steps to follow when driving in the rain?\n- Turn on your headlights - Even when it's light outside, using headlights can improve visibility and alert other drivers to your presence.\n- While on the road - Opt for the middle lanes and remain on higher ground. Rainwater tends to gather along the road edges.\n- Keep clear of puddles - Driving through puddles or low rainwater areas can cause vehicles to hydroplane or skid out of control\n- Give ample space to large vehicles - Trucks or buses can create a water spray that diminishes visibility.\n- Avoid flooded zones - If you encounter a flooded road, make a U-turn and go back. The powerful currents of flash floods can carry drivers off the road. Driving through deep water can also damage a vehicle's mechanical and electrical systems.\nWhat is hydroplaning?\nHydroplaning happens when a vehicle starts sliding uncontrollably on wet roads.\nThis happens when water in front of the tire builds up faster than the vehicle's weight can push water out of the way. The water pressure then causes the vehicle to rise and slide on a thin layer of water between the tires and the road, making the driver lose control. Hydroplaning is most commonly attributed to three factors:\n- Vehicle speed - When a vehicle's speed increases, the tire-traction grip and ability to control the vehicle decreases. Drive at a reduced speed during wet weather.\n- Water depth - The deeper the water, the sooner a vehicle loses traction on the road. It doesn't matter how deep the water is, even a thin layer can lead to hydroplaning.\n- Tire tread depth - Checking your tire tread before hitting the road is important, as low or no tread can lead to sliding.\nIn the event of your vehicle hydroplaning, here's what to know:\n- Ease off the accelerator - Step off the gas to slow down the vehicle until the tires find traction.\n- Turn into the skid - Turning into the skid can help the vehicle's tires realign to regain control.\n- Make sure the tires reconnect with the road - During the skid, wait until the tires reconnect with the road and then gently straighten the wheels to regain control.\n- Brake gently as needed - Brake normally if the vehicle has anti-lock brakes and pump brakes gently if in an older vehicle.\nSource: The National Weather Service\nThis story was originally published July 2, 2025 at 11:54 PM.",
