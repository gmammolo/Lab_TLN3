  "text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Mumbai\nMumbai, Jul 3: In a shocking incident that has rocked Mumbai’s Kandivali area, the teenage son of a well-known television actress died by suicide after jumping from the 57th floor of a high-rise building on Wednesday evening. The actress, who resides in the Sea Brook building in western Mumbai, is known for her roles in Gujarati television serials.\nAccording to preliminary reports, the tragic event took place around 7 pm after a disagreement between the mother and her son. She had reportedly asked him to attend his tuition classes, but the boy was unwilling. The argument escalated, and in a fit of rage, he went to the top floor of the building and jumped.\nThe boy, who was the couple’s only child, died on the spot due to the impact of the fall. The incident has left residents of the Kandivali area in deep shock.\nMumbai police rushed to the scene and conducted a panchnama. While a case of accidental death has been registered, unanswered questions remain — including what exactly led to the drastic step, and whether anyone witnessed the teenager jumping from the 57th floor.\nPolice are continuing their investigation to determine the exact circumstances behind the incident.",
