  "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy exited Wednesday night's game against the White Sox with an apparent leg injury. The team did not share any immediate information about the nature of the injury.\nMuncy went down on a play in the top of the sixth inning. White Sox center fielder Michael A. Taylor attempted to steal third base, but Will Smith made a successful throw over to Muncy for the second out of the frame. Muncy and Taylor collided when the Dodgers' third baseman applied the tag, and Muncy grabbed at his left knee after falling to the ground.\nMuncy remained down for a couple minutes before being helped off the field by a Dodgers trainer. He was replaced at third base by Kiké Hernández, and Taylor later exited the game as well.\nAfter scuffling at the plate through the first month and change, Muncy emerged as one of the Dodgers' steadiest bats in May and June. Entering Wednesday, his 175 wRC+ since April 30 ranked fifth highest among qualified Major Leaguers.",
