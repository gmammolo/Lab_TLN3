  "text": "Shares of managed care provider Centene Corp. CNC dropped over 40% on Wednesday, marking the worst single-day performance in the company's history.\nCheck out the current price of CNC stock here.\nWhat Happened: On CNBC’s Mad Money, Jim Cramer referred to the collapse as “a huge hit,” resulting from a combination of factors such as weak Affordable Care Act enrollments, an actuarial report pointing to sicker patients, and the company’s decision to pull its 2025 outlook .\n“Companies make forecasts, they’re supposed to try and beat them,” Cramer says, however, “they rarely pull them.”\nAccording to Cramer, Centene disclosed data from an independent actuarial firm covering 22 of the 29 states where it operates ACA exchange plans.\nSee Also: DOJ Dismantles $14 Billion Healthcare Fraud Scheme In Largest-Ever Crackdown, Impacting Over 1 Million Americans",
