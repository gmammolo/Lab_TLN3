  "text": "Sex plays an important role in everything from television series to parties and chats with friends and acquaintances.\nSo if you find the subject somehow uninteresting, you may be wondering, “Am I different?”\nSome people never feel drawn to the topic, and for them, that’s quite all right.\nThis is called asexuality.\nBut it may seem unclear whether this is really about sexual orientation or perhaps only a phase.\nClinical psychologist Robert Coordes, who is also the director-founder of the Institute for Relationship Dynamics in Berlin, Germany, spells out how to recognise asexuality, and why this state isn’t necessarily a problem.\nHow can I recognise whether I am asexual, and where lies the difference between a lack of desire, or stress, or simply just a phase? The prefix “a” is from the Greek, which means “none” or “without”, and is used to express the lack or absence of something.\nSo asexuality can be recognised when you feel neither any sexual desire nor have any sexual fantasies or daydreams.\nAsexuality is not a disturbance, but is instead overwhelmingly regarded as being a sexual orientation.\nWhat’s important to remember is that this is not a problem to be solved, as long as the person does not feel any sense of suffering.\nThe difference to a temporary lack of desire is found above all in the consistency.\nThose who are under stress or in a relationship crisis or facing health issues can, for the time being, feel little sexual desire, and this is completely normal.\nAsexual persons permanently feel no or very little sexual attraction to other people.\nThey often lack sexual attraction for many years, independent of external conditions.\nAnd being asexual does not automatically mean not wanting any human contact.\nMany people who describe themselves as asexual have loving, romantic relationships.\nAnd many people discover only very late that they can describe themselves as asexual – often following a long period when they tried to fit in or after lengthy attempts to be otherwise.\nIn my counselling practice, I always advise people not to be too quick in giving themselves a label, but instead, to give themselves time to think things through.\nThey can ask themselves these questions:\nHow long has this condition lasted so far? Were there phases of sexual attraction? Is the topic of sexuality something fundamentally neutral, or unpleasant, or simply non-existent? Is asexuality always a sexual orientation, or can it also be a symptom of, say, psychological burdens or traumatic experiences? Asexuality is primarily described as a sexual orientation, meaning a stable pattern in which people feel none, or only minimal, sexual attraction towards others.\nThis is not an illness or a deficit or symptom in a classic sense.\nAbove all, it isn’t if the asexual person is not suffering from it.\nNaturally, there can be phases in life when interest in sex disappears, be it perhaps due to depression, overburdening or rediscovered trauma.\nIn this case, we speak of a secondary lack of desire or non-appetite, and not of asexuality.\nThe decisive difference is this: With psychological burdens, there emerges a suffering caused by a lack of desire.\nBy contrast, asexual people feel mostly in harmony with themselves when they have come to understand who they are.\nIn therapy sessions, we therefore look very closely.\nIs the lack of sexual attraction a consequential expression of their own experience or maybe a withdrawal as a result of feeling overwhelmed, anxious or pain?\nYou can’t always immediately differentiate between the two.\nAnd for precisely this reason, self-reflection is so important.\nIdeally, this takes place in a protected framework, free of shame and with much patience.\nHow can I live my asexuality in a relationship, especially when my partner has other needs? Asexuality does not automatically mean being incapable of having a relationship.\nMany people who have no interest in sex can have very loving, stable and binding partnerships.\nWhen a person who finds they are asexual has a relationship with a person who likewise feels that way, then this is fundamentally not a problem.\nThe challenge is more one when the needs within the relationship must be openly and honestly sorted out, especially when one partner wants sexual closeness, but the other does not feel the same way, or does so only slightly.\nIn such a constellation it’s not about what is right and what is wrong, but rather about compatibility and mutual understanding.\nWhat’s important is that both sides can state their needs without guilt, pressure or shame.\nThis can also mean finding creative solutions together, for example, trying out other forms of intimacy, alternative relationship models, or a consciously-established measure of sexual activity with which both sides can live with.\nFundamentally speaking, a relationship is not automatically doomed to fail when sexual attraction is different for the partners.\nBut it does require conscious communication, emotional openness and an honest assessment of what is bearable for both. – By Alicia Windzio/dpa\nOpen Modal × $(document).ready(function(){ var freeBoxShow = false; $(window).scroll(function() { var scrollPercent = 100 * $(window).scrollTop() / ($(document).height() - $(window).height()); window.setTimeout(function () { //scroll to page length 35% then show the pop-up if (scrollPercent >= 35 && !freeBoxShow) { freeBoxShow = true; $('#freeHTMLBoxBtn').click(); } }, 500); }); var freeModal = document.getElementById(\"freeModal\"); $(\"#freeHTMLBoxBtn\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"block\"; //$('body').addClass('free-modal-open'); }); $(\".free-close\").click(function () { freeModal.style.display = \"none\"; //$('body').removeClass('free-modal-open'); }); var freeBox = '",
