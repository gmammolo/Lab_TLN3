  "text": "In a tragic turn of events, a state-level kabaddi player died of rabies in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr. The deceased – Brijesh Solanki – was a state-level kabaddi player. Three months ago, Solanki was bitten by a pup that he had rescued from a drain. His family say that Solanki ignored it as a minor bruise and didn’t get vaccinated. Several clips of Solanki’s last moments before death have gone viral. In the videos, the kabaddi player can be seen crying in pain and suffering rabies attacks. After his demise, Solanki’s coach Praveen Kumar said that “Brijesh woefully ignored the pain. He thought the pain in his arm to be a usual injury from the game practice.” Solanki didn’t take the vaccine as he mistook the injury as normal pain, Kumar was quoted as saying by Times of India. Last month, on June 26, Solanki told his family about numbness that he was experiencing after a practice session. After his condition deteriorated, he was taken to a hospital in Noida, where he died due to violent rabies attacks. His family in Farana village allege that the Aligarh Medical College refused to admit him. Sandeep, a friend of Solanki, told India Today that he never told anyone about the bite from the pup. &nbsp;\",",
