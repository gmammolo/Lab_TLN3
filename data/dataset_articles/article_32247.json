  "text": "AVON LAKE — A man is dead after his boat capsized off the city's boat launch. The U.S. Coast Guard called Avon Lake fire for a report of a capsized vessel just before 10 a.m. Wednesday. The department retrieved a 65-year-old man from under a fishing boat and brought him back to shore, where he was pronounced dead. Avon Lake Fire Chief Jeremy Betsa said the search was terminated for other individuals at about 11:15 a.m. There is no indication the man was accompanied in his boat. Betsa said investigators believe the man entered the lake from the Lorain boat launch. At noon on Wednesday, a Coast Guard helicopter searched for additional victims. The Miller Road Park boat launch was closed around 10:30 a.m., and starting around 11:30 a.m., boaters anchored at the inlet were allowed to start pulling out their boats. The man's name had yet to be released by the Lorain County Coroner's Office on Wednesday evening. Avon Lake fire was assisted by the Lorain County Dive Team, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and fire departments in Avon, Elyria, Sheffield Lake and North Ridgeville. Given the upcoming July 4 weekend, Betsa urged those taking boats out on the lake to wear safety equipment. \"Never go out alone, always have people with you and make sure people on shore know where you are,\" Betsa said.
