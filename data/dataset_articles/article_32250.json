  "text": "Cebu\nOver 200 drums of infectious waste stored at old North Bus Terminal\nAFTER discovering that infectious medical waste had been left uncollected for over a year at the Mandaue City Hospital (MCH), Mandaue City Mayor Thadeo “Jonkie” Ouano extended his inspection to the old North Bus Terminal in Barangay Subangdaku, where the waste had been transferred and is currently being stored.\nAround 200 drums of infectious and hazardous medical waste are currently stored at the North Bus Terminal.\nThe infectious waste includes items like used syringes, blood-soaked bandages, and other contaminated medical materials, while the hazardous waste consists of broken fluorescent lamps, chemical containers, used bottles, and similar materials.\nMost of the waste is sealed in yellow plastic bags and drums, the standard containers for biohazardous and hazardous waste.\nOfficials assured that the materials are regularly disinfected and securely stored to minimize health and environmental risks.\nOuano visited the site on Thursday, July 3, 2025, to assess the condition of the waste and its proximity to families temporarily sheltering at the terminal following a recent fire.\nConcerned over the potential health risks, the mayor immediately ordered the installation of a clear barrier to separate the waste storage area from the evacuees.
