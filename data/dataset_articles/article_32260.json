  "text": "CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — Longtime coastal bend baseball staple lee Yeager has been diagnosed with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or cancer in the area between the throat and nasal passage.\nYeager is about to begin treatment and the Veterans Memorial Baseball Booster Club is raising funds by selling shirts or taking straight donations to help with the cost.\nYeager is the only head coach the Eagles have known since the school opened in 2015. He lead Veterans Memorial to its only appearance at the baseball state tournament three years later. He also lead Carroll to the state title in 2010, the last state title that CCISD has won to date.\nPrayers for Coastal Bend staple Lee Yeager, who's been diagnosed with cancer. The Vets baseball booster club is raising money for Coach Yeager's treatments, which have already begun.\nPosted by Chris Thomasson at KIII 3News on Wednesday, July 2, 2025 Close Ad",
