  "text": "Blood donor shortage increases during fourth of July weekend\nBlood Assurance urges people to donate blood\nBOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) -According to Blood Assurance, the week surrounding Independence Day is one of the most challenging times for maintaining a stable blood supply.\nThat’s why they’re urging eligible people to donate blood and help address the ongoing shortage.\nWith more people traveling for the July 4 holiday, there are less blood donations. And with more people driving on the roads there is a higher chance of trauma accidents occurring.\nWhich is why receiving donations at this time is so important.\n“I know people have generous hearts and they want to give, and this is an excellent way that you can give. It doesn’t take any time out of your day. More than like 30-45 minutes it costs no money and you can mean the world to somebody by giving them life,” says Blood Assurance Media Relations Coordinator Brooke Katz.\nAlthough the blood donor shortage is typically in the summer or winter months, there is always a need for blood donations.\n“You’ve always got patients who are dealing with sickle cell,” Katz explains. “You’ve always got patients that are dealing with cancer. There are always trauma patients. So that need is always there, although I’m not sure it’s always front and center in people’s minds.”\nKatz believes the constant shortage for donors comes from a lack of awareness.\nBlood Assurance is asking businesses to partner with them to be able to host more blood drives throughout the year.\nOn Wednesday, the blood drive was held from 10 a.m to 3 p.m at Greenwood Mall. Within the five hours of being open, only one person was eligible to donate.\nThe donation truck will return to Bowling Green Sept. 1 12-6pm at Greenwood Mall and Sept. 19 9 a.m. -2 p.m. at Greenview Hospital.\nIf you want to donate blood you can find a donor center near you by visiting www.bloodassurance.org/schedule.\nCopyright 2025 WBKO.
