  "text": "California's growing maternity care crisis: Policy barriers and closures leave women feeling stranded without options\nEditorial Standards\nEditorial Standards\nAfter delivering more than 500 babies, Midtown Nurse Midwives in Sacramento was forced to close its doors last December, highlighting the challenges birth centers face in California.\nBethany Sasaki, who opened the center in 2019, invested over $200,000 to get the birth center licensed to expand women's access to midwifery care amid California's maternity care crisis.\n\"We have hospitals closing all over the state. We have entire counties that have no obstetrical care. We have women driving up to two hours to deliver a baby,\" said Sasaki.\nJulia Suman became a patient at California Birth Center in Rocklin after making the switch from a hospital to a birth center when she was five months pregnant.\n\"It's such a, like, milestone event in your life,\" said Suman. “If you don't want to have it feel like such a hospital stay, then you should be able to have kind of the more natural experience.\"\nIt’s an alternative option fewer women have as birth centers struggle to stay open.\nMORE | Read Part 1 of this investigation here\nSasaki said state policies, insurance reimbursements and staffing shortages make it 'impossible' to open or operate a new birth center.\nState regulators denied Sasaki's center their license due to the size of the heating system, which she blames on outdated building codes.\n\"They're written so that licensed birth centers have to be built the same as a hospital,\" said Sasaki.\nWithout a license, she said her business was unsustainable.\n\"If you don't have a license, you can't take medical and you can't take a lot of insurances,\" said Sasaki.\nOver the last decade, the number of licensed birth centers in the state dropped from 12 to 5, with only one remaining in Sacramento — the California Birth Center.\nRachel Fox-Tierney, a midwife at the California Birth Center in Rocklin, said getting licensed is a long and costly process.\nIt can take up to four years to get a license, and even with a license, she said they face other financial challenges.\n“Often [there are] a lot of hoops that we as the providers have to go through in order to get those claims paid,\" said Fox-Tierney.\nShe said reimbursements are often delayed and when the payments do arrive, sometimes, they don’t cover the full cost of the care provided.\n\"It makes it really hard to keep a business open at the rates that are what Medi-Cal wants to reimburse,\" said Fox-Tierney.\nMedi-Cal, the state's health insurance program for low-income residents, paid for 39% of births in 2022.\nWhen birth centers can’t take Medi-Cal or other insurances, it becomes a barrier for pregnant women to get the care they want or need.\n\"We have all of these birth centers closing and hospitals closing, we're taking both of those options away,\" said Sasaki.\nReducing barriers for birth centers\nAB 55, a California bill, aims to improve access to birth centers by eliminating some licensing requirements, a change that supporters have been working on for years.\n\"It should remove the barriers to opening birth centers,” said Sandra Poole, health policy advocate at the Western Center on Law & Poverty.\nThe bill also ensures these centers receive adequate Medi-Cal reimbursement for their services.\nBethany Sasaki said the state's licensing requirements forced her to shut down her Sacramento birth center in 2019. For years, she's been fighting for policy changes that improve access to care.\n\"That was so exciting,\" said Sasaki. \"It’s amazing to think how long and hard we've been working on this.\"",
