  "text": "TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Two people have died and more than 300 others have been hospitalized across France due to illnesses caused by the heatwave, according to Minister of Ecological Transition Agnes Pannier-Runacher on Wednesday.\n\"More than 300 people were brought to hospitals through emergency services across France due to the hot weather. Two people even lost their lives due to illnesses caused by the heat,\" Pannier-Runacher said during a press conference.\nEarlier on the same day, French Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said the number of emergency service calls had drastically increased after the temperature peaked on Tuesday, July 1, 2025.\n\"Yesterday, we observed an increase in the number of emergency service calls for medical assistance in the Ile-de-France region by 15 percent, this is a serious increase,\" Vautrin told RMC radio.\nMeanwhile, the national meteorological agency, Meteo France, placed four departments on maximum-level red alert.\nIn Paris, the heatwave alert level was downgraded to orange, one level before the maximum, which was also applied in 55 departments, or two-thirds of the French territory.\nIn the southern region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, 8,000 households were left without electricity after underground infrastructure became too hot and caused outages, as reported by BFMTV citing energy network operator Enedis.\nMedical journal Lancet published a study in 2023 that identified Paris as the most deadly capital in Europe during a heatwave, with an average of 400 heat-related deaths every year.\nEditor's Choice: How Heatwaves Impact the Economies Across Europe\nClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News",
