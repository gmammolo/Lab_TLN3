  "text": "9-year-old girl dies after being left in hot car while mother worked, authorities say\nGALENA PARK, Texas (KHOU) - A 9-year-old Texas girl is dead after her mother allegedly left her alone in a car for eight hours while she went to work.\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez says a 9-year-old girl was found unresponsive Tuesday in a car at a Galena Park industrial complex near where her 36-year-old mother works at a manufacturing plant.\n“I’m extremely upset and disappointed that a child, a 9-year-old, beautiful little girl, has lost her life by no fault of her own,” Gonzalez said.\nHe says the girl’s mother knowingly left her daughter in the car when her shift began around 6 a.m. The 9-year-old had some water, and the car windows were cracked. When the mother’s shift ended around 2 p.m., she found her daughter unresponsive. The girl was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\n“The mother knew and left her in the vehicle with some water, a window partially lowered and went to work,” Gonzalez said. “It’s not worth it to put a child at risk like this for any particular reason.”\nThe girl’s mother was detained and taken in for questioning. It’s unclear yet if she will face charges.\nUSG, the company that owns the property, confirmed there was a medical emergency involving the child of an employee, saying in a statement, “Our thoughts are with the family of the child and all those impacted.”\nSafety advocates say there’s no safe amount of time to leave a child alone in a vehicle, and cracking the windows will not make the air cooler.\n“A car can heat up, especially in the summertime, in a matter of minutes to a temperature that can cause brain damage and other health-related issues. Literally, in minutes, the car could be at a fatal temperature,” said Sue Auriemma with Kids and Car Safety.\nAnyone who sees a child or pet left inside a vehicle alone is encouraged to call 911 immediately.\nCopyright 2025 KHOU via CNN Newsource.
