  "text": "Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision (which overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision), the healthcare industry has continued to grapple with renewed concerns over patient privacy and reproductive healthcare. Legislators and regulators have not been idle, establishing a patchwork of authorities which require careful navigation and consideration. It is worth noting that reproductive healthcare privacy is not a concern exclusive to women. Rather, such privacy concerns also apply to services traditionally received by men, such as testosterone replacement and male fertility treatments.\nFederal Treatment of Reproductive Healthcare Privacy\nIn April of 2024, the Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\")\nissued a Final Rule (the \"Reproductive Final\nRule\") to expand HIPAA's protections around reproductive\nhealth privacy.1 The Reproductive Final Rule was issued\nin response to Executive Order 14076, which directed the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") to\nconsider ways to strengthen privacy protections for reproductive\nhealthcare services, following the Supreme Court's ruling in\nDobbs. Under the Reproductive Final Rule, the use or\ndisclosure of protected health information (\"PHI\") was\nprohibited where such use or disclosure was for the purpose of a\ncriminal, civil, or administrative investigation into, or\nproceeding against, any person seeking, obtaining, providing, or\nfacilitating lawful reproductive healthcare.2 Similarly,\nthe Reproductive Final Rule also prohibited use or disclosure of\nPHI to impose criminal, civil, or administrative liability on any\nperson for seeking, obtaining, providing, or facilitating\nreproductive healthcare.3\nThe Reproductive Final Rule is currently the target of several\nlawsuits, including one filed by the Texas Attorney General as well\nas another filed by fifteen (15) State Attorneys\nGeneral.4 The foregoing lawsuits center on arguments\nthat OCR exceeded the scope of its rulemaking authority in enacting\nthe Reproductive Final Rule. Significantly, on June 18, 2025, the\nU.S. District Court for the North District of Texas issued an order vacating the Reproductive Final Rule,\nholding that \"HHS lacked clear delegated authority to fashion\nspecial protections for medical information produced by politically\nfavored medical procedures.\"5 It is unclear whether\nthe ruling will be appealed, but it is anticipated that HHS will\nlikely not pursue further action.\nSeparately, an Executive Order issued on January 24, 2025,\nrepealed several previously-issued Executive Orders which were\nintended to protect patient access to reproductive healthcare\nservices following the Dobbs decision (including Executive\nOrder 14076 which served as one of the bases for the Reproductive\nFinal Rule). Notably, this Executive Order instructs the Director\nof the Office of Management and Budget to promulgate guidance\nrelated to the implementation of the Executive Order, which has not\nyet been published.\nState Treatment of Reproductive Healthcare Privacy\nSeveral states have taken steps to protect healthcare providers, patients, and others involved in reproductive healthcare. Although state laws vary across jurisdictions, generally they limit (or outright prohibit) the disclosure of information related to reproductive healthcare that was lawfully received by a patient and furnished by a healthcare provider. For example:\n- California amended its Confidentiality of Medical Information Act to prohibit disclosure of medical information related to an individual seeking or obtaining an abortion in response to a subpoena or even to law enforcement for purposes of enforcing a state's laws that interfere with the patient's rights under the Reproductive Privacy Act, among other prohibitions.6\n- In November 2024, New York voters approved Proposition One,\nwhich amended the\nNew York State Constitutionto explicitly protect against discrimination based on reproductive healthcare decisions and to recognize reproductive autonomy as a fundamental right in New York.\nWith individual states adopting their own unique approaches to reproductive health privacy, regulated parties must now navigate a web of authorities in an already sensitive environment.\nConclusion\nThe world of reproductive healthcare privacy remains increasingly complex due to competing federal and state interests, a shifting political landscape, as well as evolving technologies and delivery methods. While the Reproductive Final Rule faces an uncertain future, state laws and consumer privacy regulations are filling the gap by creating an overlapping and sometimes conflicting patchwork of legal authorities. It is important for healthcare providers, insurers, and digital health platforms to ensure compliance with both federal requirements and state level regulations as well as taking proactive steps to have clear policies on data sharing and privacy audits, as well as engage in strategic communication with legal counsel.\nFootnotes\n1.
