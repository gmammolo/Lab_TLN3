  "text": "A 37-year-old man died of a heart attack while working out at a gym in Ballabhgarh, Faridabad, News18 reported. The deceased has been identified as Pankaj Sharma, a resident of Raja Nahar Singh Colony. He weighed around 170 kg. As per the report, the incident occurred on Tuesday morning at a gym in Sector 9. Pankaj had arrived at the gym around 10 am with his friend Rohit. “Pankaj drank a small cup of black coffee before starting his workout and began doing shoulder pull-ups. As he attempted his third pull-up, he suddenly collapsed,” Rohit was quoted by News18 as saying. Hearing the noise, other gym members rushed to help. They tried to revive him and gave him water, but he vomited and fell again. Friends performed CPR on him twice, but there was no response, he added. As per the report, doctors from nearby Sarvodaya Hospital were called. After examining him, they declared Pankaj dead. Rohit said Pankaj had been going to the gym regularly for the past four months to lose weight. He worked with his father in their family-run construction business. His father, Rajesh, stated that Pankaj was very cautious about his health and never took any protein powders or steroids, the report added. Gym trainer Vikram Das called it a completely unexpected incident. He confirmed that timely CPR was given, but it had no effect. The police have been informed and have taken CCTV footage and other details from the gym for further investigation. Pankaj had been married for four years and was the father of a 2.5-year-old daughter.\",",
