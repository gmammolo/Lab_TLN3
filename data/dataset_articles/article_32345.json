  "text": "Tomato is one of Nigeria’s most important short-duration crops. A highly versatile and economically valuable vegetable, it contributes to food security and the survival of the country’s agricultural economy. On the home front, it is a staple ingredient in every kitchen, which comes in different forms and packages – fresh, dried, pasted, natural or synthetic. Indeed, tomato’s indispensability has made it central to the nation’s food inflationary trend. When tomatoes are scarce, the cost of feeding goes up automatically.\nThis was the major reason I penned an article on this column last month, entitled “Averting the looming tomato scarcity”. Considering the outbreak of the deadly tuta absoluta pests – also known as tomato leaf miner or tomato Ebola – in several large tomato farms across Kano, Katsina and Kaduna States, I was worried that the attack on major tomato producing hubs would definitely have a direct impact on the country’s food system.\nAs a matter of fact, the infestation, which started in March and caused a loss of tens of billions of naira, had already led to a spike in tomato prices. As of May, the Chairman of Tomato Growers and Processors Association of Nigeria, Rabiu Zuntu, said that a 50kg basket of tomatoes (selling between N5,000 and N10,000 before the outbreak) then sold for around N30,000.\nHowever, after further research and inquiry, I discovered that the pest infestation is not the major threat to Nigeria’s tomato supply chain and food security. The more lethal hazards hide in plain view.\nFor instance, there is a natural supply gap that actively contributes to tomato scarcity, which is that supplies of fresh tomatoes from the north drastically reduce during rainy seasons. Many tomato farms in the north rely on irrigation, as opposed to rain-fed agriculture, so when the rains come, the farms are not equipped to produce a large quantity, leading to a shortage. Poor road conditions in the rainy season and humid conditions contribute to post-harvest losses. Additionally, many farmers lack the facilities, such as a greenhouse, to continue production during the rainy season.\nThe point is that there are several solvable challenges that cause tomato scarcity, which the Federal Government could tackle in a holistic and multi-stakeholder fashion. Meanwhile, the rainy season creates a favourable environment for certain diseases that can affect tomato crops, such as fungal infections or the Tuta absoluta pest. In other words, the Tomato Ebola is just a single problem in a basket of issues.\nThis, too, is solvable. And, I am glad that the National Horticultural Research Institute, popularly known as NIHORT, has been on this for a long time now. The missing link is what we are about to see in the following paragraphs.\nAfter Tuta absoluta was officially reported in Nigeria in 2015, NIHORT, together with the then Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, carried out a diagnostic survey to identify the causative organisms and appropriate mitigative and preventive measures. In 2018, the institute developed Tuta trap tray – an environmentally friendly tool designed to eliminate adult Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer) pest, as part of an integrated pest management solution. It also developed biopesticides: NIHORT-Lyptol and NIHORT-Raktin, innovated to target the eggs and larvae of Tuta absoluta.\nThe reader, surely, may now be wondering if these government-sponsored solutions are available, why is Tomato Ebola still ravaging our farms? The answer is as shocking as it is revealing.\nAfter the mass production of the biopesticides and the Tuta Trap Tray from 2018 till date; conducting Hausa radio live phone-in programmes (from 2018 to 2023) in Kano (major hotspot); airing of sustainable Tuta control jingles in Hausa in various radio stations; production and awareness-creation dissemination of flyers; participating in press conferences and brainstorming sessions on Tuta absoluta menace; training farmers in major tomato-producing states such as Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Jigawa and Plateua States; distribution of 2,000 litres of Lyptol to farmers across the northern states in 2020 and recently production of 4,000 litres of the biopesticies and 500 trap trays for farmers’ use; sending 6,000 litres to Kano State; the needle did not move an inch because most farmers never showed any enthusiasm to adopt and use the pesticides and Tuta trap tray.\nOn enquiry about why the efforts hit a brick wall, I was told by NIHORT staff, “The status of usage with respect to Tuta Trap Tray, as when we sent it to the Kano office, had not changed. Not a single TTT was requested from our Kano office till now. There was no single request for the Integrated Pest Management solutions in our Kano office for 15 months while we waited to solve the problem. Having run almost 16 weeks’ jingles on solutions to Tuta in the local language on Kano and Kaduna (in two) radio stations. All this was done in NIHORT’s response to the claims of the Tuta absoluta outbreak in 2023. They didn’t comply, maybe because they needed to pay for our own, but that of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture (which we supplied), I believe, was free as gratis/subsidy.”\nI, therefore, concluded that the major problem faced by the Nigerian agricultural sector is passing down research output to end-users – that is, the farmers.\nFrankly, if the Nigerian people do what is right, there would not be any substantial threat from the pests, as we already have the institutions and capacity to tackle them decisively. In fact, breeding work is currently ongoing at NIHORT by a team of research scientists to develop new tomato varieties that are resistant to Tuta absoluta. Additionally, the Federal Government has supported the institute to develop two new varieties of tomatoes in April 2025 that are resistant to bacterial wilt (another globally recognised menace in the tomato value chain).\nThe Executive Director of the National Horticultural Research Institute, Dr Mohammed Lawal Attanda, said, “Another challenge is the purchasing power of the farmers. With the outbreak of Tuta absoluta disease, we sprang into action. We have a breakthrough technology to cater for the outbreak. We produced a solution and took it to the field, but the farmers could not really pay for it. They need a subsidised rate for it. But we could not subsidise this bio-pesticide for them. It is organically made and environmentally friendly. It is 100 per cent locally made, certified, and we even have a patent on it. But the farmers cannot afford it. So, the ministry has to come in. We are in that process now to get it across to the farmers. I believe with all hands on deck, we can surmount all the challenges.”\nThe question is, how long are we going to wait before the farmers get the required support to be able to afford the Tuta absoluta solution? This is why I said that the pest infestation is not the problem of tomato production in Nigeria. There is an urgent need to create the necessary linkage between industry and research. It is my view that the government must also set up a special food security fund, which is directed to intervention in critical food production sub-sectors, like tomato.\nReal farmers must be helped to produce organic food for the citizens, in a way that they are not encumbered with the activities of speculators and profiteers. They need access to quality and affordable tomato seeds. If the government cannot subsidise the seeds produced by NIHORT, at least it should do all in its power to drive down the cost of imported seeds. For instance, about 300g of tomato seeds is around N150,000. This is so because the horticultural seed market is largely dominated by seed importation from Europe and other countries. This does not augur well for our country’s food security.",
