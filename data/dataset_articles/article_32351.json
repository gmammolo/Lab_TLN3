  "text": "Two-timing triage\nHaving spent all night in the emergency department with someone and having to return the next day for their ultrasound was tiring, but we’re fortunate to be in a country that provides these services.\nVery fortunate considering what health care, or the complete lack of it, looks like for ill and injured people in other places.\nStill, this addresses our first-world Canadian problems and thoughts for a solution to a specific occurrence.\nThe patient in this incident was triaged and treated within nine hours, with a callback the next day for an ultrasound when the department was open. With that, I have no issue. The staff administered care knowledgeably and professionally.\nFollowing the ultrasound the next day, instead of the chart that the staff used only five hours prior being available, the patient waited in line for three hours to undergo a new triage, followed by registration and a second chart for the same issue.\nWaiting is normal in an emergency department, yet it would have been nice if the time-consuming hours waiting for a turn with the one triage staff member had been bypassed, especially when there were several returnees.\nI’m a retired nurse, but don’t comprehend the reason behind a new triage, other than billing two emergency visits for the same problem. The repeat triage could be a government mandate, not considered double billing, but it comes close and seems a waste of resources.\nI found conflicting information about the use of the same chart and no definitive answer. Should such a regulation requiring a re-triage exist for this type of followup visit that needs investigation? A certain time limit that must not be exceeded, perhaps.\nIn my example, the previous night’s emergency visit resulted in the patient spending over five hours in the waiting room, unattended by anyone other than me and without being re-triaged. Why would the return for a test ordered due to the initial problem within an identical five-hour time frame trigger the need for a repeat of the triage procedure? Especially when our hospital budgets are one sponge and scalpel short.\nOf course, patients in greater need with a higher triage number must be seen first. But in the case of those returning, their problem is already known. If they have had their tests with no need for medical intervention due to health issues, a doctor will reassess them after investigating the results. Waiting in line for an already beleaguered triage nurse who wants to know information which likely hasn’t changed in the last few hours, only to construct a new chart and recharge the system, clogs the works and serves no one.\nMary Daurio, Welland\nIran bombing questioned\nApparently 18 U.S. intelligence agencies told their director that Iran was not building nuclear weapons. So how to explain Donald Trump’s decision to bomb Iran?\nThe Israeli prime minister said they did.\nSo this convicted felon took the word of a man who, without the war in Gaza, might be in prison himself. What a surprise. Can anyone say weapons of mass destruction?\nJohn Rowan, Welland",
