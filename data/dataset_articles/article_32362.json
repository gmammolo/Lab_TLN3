  "text": "Scorching Struggles: Surviving Gaza's Summer Heat\nIn the war-torn Gaza Strip, residents like Rida Abu Hadayed face intensified hardships in the sweltering summer heat. Displaced families struggle with severe water shortages and inadequate sanitation, exacerbating health risks. Fuel scarcity hampers crucial water production, leaving 93% of Gazan households facing dire water shortages.\nRida Abu Hadayed endures significant challenges as a sweltering summer compounds daily struggles in the embattled Gaza Strip.\nCramped living in a nylon tent, her children suffer from severe heat as temperatures soar above 30 degrees Celsius. The region faces critical water shortages, with crippling effects on sanitation and health.\nThe dire situation is compounded by a severe scarcity of fuel, hindering crucial water production operations and leaving the majority of Gazans to ration and walk long distances for water. Aid agencies warn of cascading health issues if the situation persists.\n(With inputs from agencies.)\nAdvertisement",
