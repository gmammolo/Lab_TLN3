  "text": "By Mohd Iswandi Kasan Anuar\nJAKARTA, July 3 (Bernama) -- The director of the Indonesia Hospital in Gaza, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, was killed along with members of his family in an Israeli airstrike on their home in Tal al-Hawa, southwest Gaza City, on Wednesday, according to an Indonesian humanitarian organisation.\nThe Medical Emergency Rescue Committee (MER‑C), a Jakarta-based non-governmental organisation that operates the hospital, confirmed the deaths in a statement citing information from its local team in Gaza.\n“With deep sorrow, we announce the death of Dr Marwan and members of his family, following a direct airstrike on their residence,” a local MER‑C volunteer said.\nAt least nine Palestinians were killed and several others injured in the attack, the organisation said.\nDr Marwan, a Palestinian, was described as a “highly dedicated medical professional” who had served the people of Gaza for many years, particularly during repeated crises and armed conflicts.\n“His passing is a profound loss, not only to his colleagues but also to his patients and the wider Gaza community who knew him. May he and his family be granted the best place in the hereafter,” MER-C added.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a “heinous crime” against medical personnel.\n“Every crime against medical and humanitarian personnel confirms the bloody methodology and the premeditated insistence on directly and deliberately targeting them,” the ministry stated in a statement.\nThe Indonesian government also expressed its condolences and strong condemnation.\n“Indonesia expresses its deep condolences over the passing of Dr Marwan along with his family on July 2, and strongly condemns the Israeli attack,” the Foreign Ministry posted on X.\nThe statement praised Dr Marwan’s “service, commitment, and struggle in the name of humanity and for peace in Palestine,” and said Indonesia was continuing to closely monitor developments at the hospital.\nIndonesia reiterated its call for an immediate ceasefire and an end to what it described as “Israel’s atrocities”.\nThe Indonesia Hospital in northern Gaza, funded by Indonesian civil society, has provided critical trauma care since 2016, with Dr Marwan playing a central role in sustaining its operations amid ongoing conflict.\n-- BERNAMA\nBERNAMA provides up-to-date authentic and comprehensive news and information which are disseminated via BERNAMA Wires; www.bernama.com; BERNAMA TV on Astro 502, unifi TV 631 and MYTV 121 channels and BERNAMA Radio on FM93.9 (Klang Valley), FM107.5 (Johor Bahru), FM107.9 (Kota Kinabalu) and FM100.9 (Kuching) frequencies.\nFollow us on social media :\nFacebook : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatv, @bernamaradio\nTwitter : @bernama.com, @BernamaTV, @bernamaradio\nInstagram : @bernamaofficial, @bernamatvofficial, @bernamaradioofficial\nTikTok : @bernamaofficial\n© 2025 BERNAMA\n• Disclaimer\n• Privacy Policy\n• Security Policy",
