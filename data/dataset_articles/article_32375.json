  "text": "A BFNL premiership star is set to be sidelined for at least the rest of the home and away season after a training mishap this week.\nMelton's Jaycob Hickey looks to have broken his leg after a training incident on Tuesday night.\nAt best, the injury is expected to keep Hickey sidelined until the finals, but if scans reveal a worse-than-expected injury, it could mean the star onballer misses the rest of the BFNL season.\nHickey was in dynamic form, particularly early this season, when he was named among the best players in seven of the first eight matches of the season. Those big games saw him score 22 votes in The Courier's BFNL player of the year to be just\nfive votes behind leader Brett Bewley.\nThe injury to the Bloods' midfield maestro comes just one week after another finals contender, Sunbury, lost its best midfielder in\nJosh Guthrie for the remainder of the season.\nBloods coach Troy Scoble said it was simply an unlucky incident where a player fell across Hickey's leg at training.\n\"What we know at the moment is he has some form of fracture in his leg,\" Scoble said. \"We don't know the severity of it as yet.\n\"He's had some scans on it yesterday and we're just waiting to see if there's any other damage associated with it.\n\"Initially, when it happened, we thought it was an ankle, but it's definitely a fracture between his shin and his ankle. There's some form of fracture; it's dependent on the MRI scans now.\n\"If it's just a fracture, that's the best case scenario and we can just let that heal, but if there's more damage, then we'll have to work out what happens from there.\"\nThere are seven home-and-away matches still to play in the season, plus this weekend's bye week, giving Hickey an eight-week turnaround to be fit for the finals.\nA top-three position for the club, which currently sits second on the ladder, should ensure a double chance, provided the third-placed team does not go down to the sixth-placed finisher in an elimination final.\nIt's been a wretched run with injury for the reigning BFNL premiers, who at the weekend had 21 players across their senior list sidelined, with the senior team just falling to top team Darley in a thrilling finish on Saturday.\n\"We've been quite unlucky that a lot of the injuries we've had have been broken bones and things like that, we haven't had the hamstrings and the calves and that type of thing,\" Scoble said.\nDaily\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.",
