  "text": "Beauty fix: My go-to foundation isn’t working in this summer heat – it’s melting and it’s too pale. Help!\nFavourite foundation doesn’t cut it or stay put in summer? Sarah Caden gets expert tips\nIn the warmer weather, my foundation is too pale and melting off my face. How can I switch it up for summer?\nEven if it’s not actually sunny, higher temperatures and humidity can lead to sweatiness and melting make-up. Add to that the fact that even with diligent use of SPF, skin tone may edge a little darker in summer and suddenly that favourite winter foundation gives a clammy waxwork look.\nTexture, tone and application are what make all the difference come summer, says Clarins training manager Ireland, Louise Sheehan.\n“For summer, there are great alternatives to your foundation, like BB or CC creams, tinted moisturisers, or skin tints,” she says. “These usually have a lighter, breathable coverage and a more natural finish.”\nCould I lose foundation altogether and still look put together?\n“Yes,” says Sheehan. “To leave out foundation entirely, you can try just wearing a primer with some concealer where you need it, which, with some bronzer, is a beautiful combination.\n“To try something different, you could underpaint. This technique was made famous by celebrity make-up artist Mary Phillips on Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber.\n“Think layering but in reverse. Start off using a cream bronzer on bare skin, then apply concealer or foundation in key areas around the face – but not all over — and blend lightly. This gives a more natural look and the ‘glow’ comes from underneath your make-up.”\nI like to look sun-kissed while still using my SPF, can this be achieved by going darker with my foundation?\nA few drops of liquid bronzer added to foundation can lend a subtle glow, Sheehan says, or if your skin tone naturally changes in summer, go get shade-matched. If you simply go darker, without paying attention to your skin’s undertones of pink, blue or yellow, then a step-up shade may look muddy.\n“One thing you can add into your nightly skincare routine is self-tan,” says Sheehan. “This will deliver a healthy glow to your face the next morning, warming up the look of your everyday make-up. You may even find you don’t want to use as much foundation the next day.”\nI’m not willing to buy a new base, so will a brush of bronzer help?\nIf you’re sticking with your year-round foundation and simply want to ramp up the sun-kissed look with bronzer, Sheehan says to make sure the finished effect is properly balanced.\n“Go light on the coverage,” she says. “A sheer application of your winter foundation can prevent it from looking too stark against tanned or warmer skin, so apply with your fingers instead of a brush for a lighter finish. Once you blend well and apply your bronzer to areas where the sun naturally hits – so the forehead, cheeks, nose, and jawline – the end result will look natural.”\nAnd then how can I help my foundation stay put in the heat?\n“Try an emulsion or oil-free product instead of a cream moisturiser, as these are lightweight and hydrate without heaviness,” says Sheehan. .\n“Primer will help foundation adhere better to your skin, and look out for foundation formulas labelled long-wear or transfer proof. Then set your make-up strategically, with a setting powder or spray, or even both. If you choose powder, try pressing it lightly on to the skin in light taps with a small blending brush, rather than dusting it over the full face and ideally, use it just on the T-zone. And finally, to keep summer foundation intact, avoid touching your face.”\nClarins Skin Illusion Tinted Moisturiser, €43 for 40ml, Clarins counters nationwide\nImmensely moisturising with hyaluronic acid, vitamin-C-rich kiwi extract for brightness and chicory extract for a promised collagen boost, this is make-up with benefits. And, unlike tinted moisturisers of old, its overall dewy finish delivers decent coverage in 11 different shades. Most skin types will not need an additional moisturiser and, handily for summer, it has SPF25 and also comes in a 15ml size (€22.50) for travel.\nBare by Vogue Face Tanning Serum, €30, selected shops and pharmacies nationwide, barebyvogue.com\nThis latest addition to the Bare sunless-tanning collection is a glide-on silky serum with skincare benefits from hyaluronic acid and peptides to vitamin E and oat lipids. These ingredients help to counter the drying effect of DHA, the sugar-derived ingredient that creates the fake tan. Available in three shades – light, medium and dark – it develops in 4-8 hours, making it ideal as an overnight glow bestower.\nVieve Invisiveil Setting Spray, €33 for 100ml, brownthomas.com\nThere is much to love about a facial mist, but particularly in summer when a spritz of something skin-loving can bring make-up back to life. The bonus with this one is its ability to set and hold make-up without adding to any sweatiness. Ideal for anyone who finds even the lightest powder settles into pores or looks chalky. Alcohol-free, with a light neroli scent and hydrating ingredients, it also comes in a 50ml travel size (€18.50).\nJoin the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel\nStay up to date with all the latest news",
