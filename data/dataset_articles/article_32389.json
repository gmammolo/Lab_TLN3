  "text": "July 03, 2025\nLily Allen admits she's had too many abortions to keep track of.\nThe British singer, 40, shared in a recent episode of her podcast Miss Me? that she used to \"get pregnant all the time\" back in the day, which led to several abortions.\n\"Abortions, I've had a few. But then again, I can't remember exactly how many...I think maybe like, I want to say four or five,\" Allen said as her co-host Miquita Oliver added that she's also had \"about five.\"\nAllen recalled how she once mistook a man's offer to pay for the abortion as \"generous\" and \"romantic\" until he ghosted her after the procedure.\n\"I remember once getting pregnant and the man paying for my abortion, and me thinking it was so romantic,\" the singer recalled.\n\"I don't think it's generous or romantic,\" she affirmed, recalling that the man never followed up with her afterwards.\nAllen shares daughters Marnie Rose, 12, and Ethel Mary, 13, with ex-husband Sam Cooper. She and Cooper also had a son, George, who was stillborn in 2010.\nBack in February, multiple sources confirmed that the singer and her Stranger Things actor husband David Harbour had separated after more than four years of marriage.\n\"She's devastated and not in a good place,\" an insider told People Magazine of Allen at the time. They also shared that the split from Harbour has \"been very hard for her and her girls.\"\n\"It's been a bad start to the new year, but Lily is tough,\" the insider added. \"She's very good at prioritising herself when she has to.\"",
