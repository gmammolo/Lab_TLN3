  "text": "(WGHP) — Local food banks are bracing for blowback if President Donald Trump’s megabill passes. In North Carolina alone, more than 1.4 million people count on SNAP benefits. 600,000 of them are children. Since the program was created, SNAP has been completely federally funded. Depending on which version of the bill ultimately passes (or if it doesn’t), North Carolina would have to come up with as much as $700 million to continue funding the program or be forced to reduce eligibility and cut benefits. For local food banks, that means they’re expecting more people who need their help to put food on the table. FOX8 checked in with two food bank agencies on Wednesday that are preparing for the worst. “We cannot fill this gap. Iit would literally take nine or ten times the amount of food we are providing,” Second Harvest Bank of Northwest North Carolina CEO Eric Aft said. Aft said their Winston-Salem-based nonprofit is on track to provide 40 million meals in the 18 counties they serve this year alone. The need for supplemental food has risen steadily since the pandemic. “Going back three years ago, we would average serving about 36,000 individuals a month. When we look at this year, the average is 79,000 people every single month,” Aft said. Safe Alamance, a smaller nonprofit serving about 3,500 families, is also seeing an increased need in its community. “We’re actually working at maximum capacity at this pantry, and the other pantry, we’re really close,” Executive Director of SAFE Alamance Tiffanie Jackson said. Jackson said it’s not just the proposed cuts to SNAP affecting pantries. Cuts to The Emergency Food Assistance Program are already impacting them. TEFAP is a Reagan-era program that buys food from farmers for food banks. $500 million of funding for the program was frozen or canceled under the Trump administration this year. “Months ago, the average we were seeing was about 12,000 pounds a month we could order. Last month, it was 4,000 pounds,” Jackson said. For those who volunteer at food banks, the fear of having to turn people away is growing. “They all have a story to tell about why they are here,” said Denise Elinski, a SAFE Alamance board member and volunteer. When people arrive at the pantry in Graham, Elinski gets to know them as they peruse items like potato flakes, beans and corn to feed their families. “I just feel like it’s getting more and more difficult for people to have their basic needs met,” Elinski said. Both Second Harvest and SAFE Alamance are urging people to contact lawmakers and tell them to remember how many people are struggling with hunger in North Carolina, which is a state with 15 percent food insecurity. “This is not a situation about a handout. This is about dignity. This is about supporting our community. None of us go through this life on our own, and one of the beautiful things about North Carolina and America is that we care for each other,” Aft said. SAFE Alamance is asking for creative solutions and holding two community meetings soon. The first of which is on July 9 at 9 a.m. at their location at 5950 NC-87 S in Graham.
