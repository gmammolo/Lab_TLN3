  "text": "Fourteen people were hospitalized after a single-engine skydiving plane went down on Wednesday in Gloucester County, New Jersey. The call came in around 5:25 p.m. for a mass casualty incident at Cross Keys Airport, which is located on the 1500 block of North Tuckahoe Road in Williamstown. When crews arrived, they found extensive damage to the plane and many victims covered in jet fuel, according to Andrew Halter with Gloucester County Emergency Management. \"Patients were decontaminated prior to being transported to the hospital. There were 15 souls on board in the aircraft, including the pilot,\" he said. The view from Chopper 6 showed a massive response with multiple victims being taken away on stretchers. Officials said 14 people, including the pilot, were hospitalized for various injuries. Three people who were airlifted from the scene were reported to be in critical condition. Halter said the other injuries appear to be minor, and one of the people on the plane refused treatment at the scene. According to investigators, the pilot reported engine trouble before the plane crashed into a tree near the runway. \"The pilot was reportedly in an ascent at that point, and again reported some engine trouble, and that's when he was trying to circle back to make it back down onto the ground but was unable to do so,\" said Halter. Some residents are concerned about future flights and the skydivers' safety. \"Some of them planes come so close down to our house that it's crazy. I have kids in there. Who knows if they're going to crash into our house,\" said Sierra Kelly of Williamstown. The Cessna 208B plane is owned by Arne Aviation LLC and is leased to Skydive Cross Keys in Gloucester County. Crews will work through the night to comb through the wreckage, which is in a wooded area near the airport. The exact cause of the crash is still under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
