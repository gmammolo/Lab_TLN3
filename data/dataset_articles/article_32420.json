  "text": "Baby products urgently pulled off shelves due to fears of choking, strangulation, death\nThe ACCC has urgently recalled a number of children’s products due to life-threatening safety fears.\nBaby bottle self feeding devices, which were sold by Ezonedeal online nationally between May 9, 2024 and April 10, 2025, have been urgently pulled from shelves as they pose a serious risk of choking and death.\nThe products are available in cyan and pink, with the product codes Z3007 and Z3008.\nThe bottle feeding device is designed to position or prop the bottle above the baby’s head while they’re on their back, allowing the liquid to flow into the baby’s mouth without assistance from a caregiver.\nThe ACCC said there was a “risk of serious injury or death from choking, aspiration pneumonia, suffocation and ear infections”.\n“There have been reports of infant fatalities associated with the use of baby bottle self-feeding devices,” the statement read.\nAn infant using the bottle feeding device cannot stop the flow of the bottle or pull away from the incoming liquid.\nInfants can also suffer from ear infections while feeding on their back, as the milk and bacteria pools in the back of the mouth, which is connected to the ear.\n“Ear infections can lead to long term damage and an increased risk of hearing or speech problems,” the recall read.\nCustomers with the product have been told to stop using the product immediately and dispose of it safely so it cannot be used by anyone else.\nCustomers can contact Ezonedeal for a full refund or store credit if it has been sold or gifted to another person\nThe ACCC have also urgently recalled car seat head support straps, also available for purchase on Ezonedeal online nationally between October 18 2021 and November 1 2022.\nThey are available in blue and red with the product codes Z1451 and Z1758.\nThe car seat straps, which are intended to keep a child’s head secure as they ride in the back seat of the vehicle, aims to stop the child from slumping forward if they fall asleep.\nHowever, the ACCC have pulled the items off the shelves due to fears of damaging a child’s spinal cord by altering their head and spine, and cause further risk of strangulation and suffocation.\n“Car seat head straps can increase the risk of spinal cord injury or death by altering head and neck alignment during a crash,” the recall read.\n“They may also pose a suffocation or strangulation risk if they slip around the child’s mouth or neck.”\nInjuries and incidents have already occurred, the ACCC said.\nThere have been no reported deaths associated with the straps in Australia. However, an eight-month-old infant reportedly died in the UK due to suffocation connected to the use of a car seat head strap in August 2021.\nThe infant was reportedly strangled by the strap, which slipped around the child’s neck after the car rolled in an accident.\nCustomers have been told to stop using the product immediately and dispose of it so others can’t use it.\nThose with the product can contact Ezonedeal for a full refund or store credit.\nCustomers can reach out the Ezonedeal via email or via phone on (03) 7065 6422 between 10am to 3pm Monday to Friday.\nOriginally published as Baby products urgently pulled off shelves due to fears of choking, strangulation, death",
