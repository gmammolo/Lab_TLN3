  "text": "NSW man dies after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus\nA man bitten by a bat several months ago has died from a horrific virus.\nNSW Health confirmed a man in his 50s died after contracting NSW’s first recorded case of Australian bat lyssavirus.\n“We express our sincere condolences to the man’s family and friends for their tragic loss,” A NSW Health spokesperson said on Thursday afternoon.\n“While it is extremely rare to see a case of Australian bat lyssavirus, there is no effective treatment for it.”\nThe virus, a close relative of the rabies virus, is spread to humans when saliva enters the body through cuts or scratches.\nIt’s been found in species of fruit bats, insect eating microbats and flying foxes.\nA Health Protection director from NSW Health, Keira Glasgow, said it was a “tragic situation” following news the man was battling the virus.\n“The man had been bitten by a bat several months ago and received treatment following the injury,” Ms Glasgow said on Wednesday.\n“Further investigation is underway to understand whether other exposures or factors played a role in his illness.”\nThe tragedy marks the fourth Australian death from the disease since 1996, with the other three deaths occuring in Queensland.\nBat scratches and bites left 118 people in need of medical assistance across the state last year, however this marks the first case of the virus in NSW.\nMs Glasgow warned it was “crucial” for anyone bitten or scratched by bats to urgently seek medical assessment.\n“If you are bitten or scratched by a bat, urgent medical assessment is crucial,” Ms Glasgow said.\n“You will need to wash the wound thoroughly for 15 minutes right away with soap and water and apply an antiseptic with anti-virus action, such as betadine, and allow it to dry.\n“You will then require treatment with rabies immunoglobulin and rabies vaccine.”\nAny bats could carry the life-threatening virus, she warned, with a NSW Health spokesperson urging Aussies to avoid touching or handling the animals.\n“Only wildlife handlers who are trained, protected, and vaccinated should interact with bats,” the spokesperson said.\nOriginally published as NSW man dies after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus",
