  "text": "BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) – Blue-green algae have hit popular beaches in Vermont and New York, causing the first closures of the summer.\nOfficials from Burlington Parks and Rec say Oakledge and Texaco beaches are closed on Thursday due to category 3 levels of cyanobacteria. That means a high amount is present, and there should be no swimming there.\nOfficials report that North Beach has category 2 levels of the algae, meaning the most vulnerable, like children and pets, should stay out.\nIn Clinton County, the blooms closed Point Au Roche State Park to swimming until levels are lowered.",
