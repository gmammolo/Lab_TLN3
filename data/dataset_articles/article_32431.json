  "text": "Roskachestvo: Holidays in all-inclusive hotels carry risks of poisoning\nAll-inclusive vacations carry potential risks of food poisoning, warned Elena Specenko, director of the Roskachestvo Center for Food Safety Competencies. In conversation with Lenta.<url>\" she explained how to minimize the threat to health.\n\"The first thing you should pay attention to when visiting the hotel's restaurant is the general sanitary condition, cleanliness of surfaces, appliances and dishes, as well as the availability of refrigeration and heating equipment on the Swedish line. The lack of cooling tables and heated surfaces on the Swedish line indicates the impossibility of maintaining the temperature conditions of food storage,\" Specsenko advised.\nDuring the holiday season, according to the expert, the flow of guests and the load on hotels increases significantly, due to which there may not be enough refrigeration and heating equipment, thermal boxes for storing and transporting products. This leads to food spoilage and the risk of food poisoning due to the consumption of products that were distributed without heating or cooling, she added.\nIt is also necessary to pay attention to drinking water, it is better to use bottled water whenever possible and avoid questionable water sources.\nElena Specencodirector of the Center of Competence in the field of food safety of Roskachestvo\"Dishes that have been in the public domain for a long time without observing the temperature regime are particularly dangerous. It would be safer to avoid raw and semi—raw foods such as sushi, tartare or poached eggs, as well as salads with mayonnaise dressing, dairy products that have been left without refrigeration for more than an hour,\" said Specsenko.\nAt the first signs of poisoning — nausea, diarrhea or weakness — you should stop eating at the hotel, drink more clean water and seek medical help immediately, the expert said. In case of serious doubts about the quality of food, it is better to give preference to proven restaurant chains outside the hotel than to risk your health, the specialist concluded.\nEarlier it became known that a tourist from Russia drank a popular drink during a vacation in Egypt and lost consciousness. While walking along the beach, the traveler bought her son a fruit drink bubble tea with tapioca. The boy did not drink the tea, considering it disgusting, and gave it to his mother. The woman finished her drink and felt unwell, and then fainted right on top of her husband.",
