  "text": "US-bound Air India flight grounded in Vienna after issue detected during fuel stop\nRoutine checks during a planned Vienna fuel stop forced Air India's Delhi-Washington flight to stay grounded, leaving passengers stranded.\nIn Short\n- Another Air India Dreamliner plane suffered technical glitch in Vienna\n- Passengers safely deboarded, hotel stay arranged for those eligible\n- Return flight from Washington to New Delhi cancelled, refund issued\nAn Air India flight operating on the Delhi to Washington, DC route was grounded in Vienna on Wednesday after a routine inspection during a scheduled refuelling stop flagged an extended maintenance issue.\nFlight AI103, which departed from Delhi on July 2, landed in Vienna as part of a planned fuel halt. According to an Air India spokesperson, routine checks during the stopover revealed an issue that required additional maintenance work, forcing the airline to cancel the onward leg to Washington.\n\"As a result, passengers were disembarked in Vienna. Those eligible for visa-free entry or holding valid Schengen visas were provided hotel accommodation until the next available flight. For passengers without entry permission, arrangements are being made in coordination with Austrian immigration and security authorities,\" an Air India spokesperson said.\nThe disruption also impacted the return service — Flight AI104 from Washington to Delhi via Vienna — which was subsequently cancelled. Air India said affected passengers have been rebooked on alternative flights or offered full refunds.\nThe flight was a Boeing Dreamliner, a passenger jet that is in focus around the world following the crash of Air India Flight 171 in Ahmedabad, which killed over 270 people.\nAir India and its low-cost arm Air India Express together operate more than 1,100 flights daily, carrying over 1,50,000 passengers. The airline asserted that it has stepped up pre-flight safety checks and temporarily reduced some services to ensure operational stability and minimise last-minute disruptions.\nThe Tata Group-owned airline has come under intense scrutiny following the Ahmedabad crash and a series of mid-air technical glitches on other routes. In response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered comprehensive inspections of all Dreamliners equipped with GenX engines. The safety audit covers critical components such as fuel parameter monitoring systems, cabin air compressors, engine control systems, and more.\nThe airline has warned of delays due to the inspection and said that \"some of these checks could lead to higher turnaround time and potential delays on certain long-haul routes\". The airline added that customers will be duly notified about any delays and advised them to check flight status before heading to the airport.",
