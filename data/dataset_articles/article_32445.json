  "text": "As the 2025 East Asian Cup approaches, the women's national football team has been hit with a series of injury setbacks.The Korea Football Association announced on the 3rd that \"Lee Young-joo (Levante UD) has a left knee injury, and Park Soo-jung (Ulsan University of Science and Technology) has a right thigh injury, leading to the urgent selection of Kim Yoo-ri (Hwacheon KSPO).\"The team, led by coach Shin Sang-woo, will participate in the 2025 East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Championship, which will be held in Japan starting on the 9th. The national team will face China on the 9th, Japan on the 13th, and Taiwan on the 16th.The national team is struggling with consecutive injuries. On the 29th of last month, Choi Yoo-ri (Birmingham City) suffered a right thigh injury, and Kim Jin-hee (Gyeongju Hanwha) was sidelined with a left knee injury. Their absences will be filled by Hyun Seul-ki (Gyeongju Hanwha) and Maeng Da-hee (Hwacheon KSPO).The roster, originally consisting of 23 players, has been expanded with the addition of 3 more players; however, due to injuries, the final number of players called up has been confirmed at 25.[Photo] Lee Young-joo / Korea Football Association[OSEN]",
