  "text": "A health advisory has been issued for Newport's Nye Beach warning people to avoid contact with the water due to \"unsafe levels of fecal bacteria,\" according to the Oregon Health Authority. Nye Beach is a popular spot in downtown Newport south of Yaquina Head Outstanding Natural Area. \"Unsafe levels of fecal bacteria can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections, and other illnesses,\" OHA said in a news release. \"Children, elderly and those with a compromised immune system should use extra caution as they are more vulnerable to illness from waterborne bacteria.\" Visitors should avoid wading in nearby creeks, pools of water on the beach, or in discolored water, and stay clear of water runoff flowing into the ocean, officials said. \"Levels of fecal bacteria tend to be higher in these types of water sources,\" OHA said. Unsafe levels of fecal bacteria in ocean waters can come from both shore and inland sources including: Ocean waters will be re-tested after an advisory is issued. Once bacteria levels are at a safe level, OHA will notify the public that the advisory is lifted. While this advisory is in effect at Nye Beach, state officials encouraged other recreational activities on the beach and noted that they \"pose no health risk even during an advisory,\" OHA said. For the most recent information on advisories, go to the Oregon Beach Monitoring Program website at healthoregon.org/beach or call 971-673-0482, or 877-290-6767 (toll-free).
