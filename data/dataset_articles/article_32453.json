  "text": "The series of serious cases of diarrhoea in northern France, with 29 children affected and one death, was caused by bacterially contaminated meat, officials said on Wednesday. Prefecture officials in the town of Saint-Quentin said the meat was distributed via five butcher's shops that have since been closed by the authorities, following analyses by the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Investigations into all the butcher shops concerned are continuing and the results will be forwarded to the public prosecutor's office in Paris to identify those responsible. In addition to the children, one pensioner also fell ill. A rare form of acute kidney failure occurred in 10 of those affected, from which one 12-year-old died. The children developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which usually occurs as a result of an intestinal infection and leads to the formation of blood clots that block the brain, heart and kidneys in particular. The wave of the disease caused great concern in Saint-Quentin, a town of 53,000 inhabitants. The town set up a crisis hotline. Parents were called to alert the emergency services if children had severe diarrhoea. Anyone who still has frozen meat from one of the butcher's shops at home should dispose of it and clean their fridge thoroughly, the authorities recommended.",
