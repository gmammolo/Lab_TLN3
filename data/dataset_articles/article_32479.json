  "text": "‘We’re being penalised’: Breast cancer survivor reveals medical screening double standard\nA breast cancer survivor is calling out a double standard with medical screenings, saying she feels penalised for being diagnosed with cancer.\nDebbie Swain revealed that women who have been diagnosed are expected to pay almost $500 for a mammogram, while women who don’t have cancer get the screening for free.\n“It should be free. To all women, as it is before cancer. I said we’ve all gone through this, and we’re being penalised. So somebody without cancer doesn’t pay, but somebody with does,” she told 4BC Afternoons.\nShe added that because it hadn’t been five years and she hadn’t been declared cancer-free, she’s forced to pay out of pocket because BreastScreen Australia won’t see her.\n“There will be women who are deterred from having vital checkups if they find themselves in a similar situation to you and are skipping those checks because they simply don’t have the money to pay for it,” Sofie Formica added.\nHear more highlights from Sofie Formica below and download the 4BC App on iOS or Android to ensure you don’t miss a thing!\nImage: iStock.\nDownload this podcast\nhere",
