  "text": "MONROVIA — A group under the banner of the ‘Liberia Media Initiative for Transparency and Accountability’ (LIMITA) has commended President George Weah’s decision to nominate Cllr. Minister Frank Musa Dean as an Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Liberia. In a statement issued on Thursday, December 28, 2023, the Board of Directors of LIMITA described the recent nomination of Cllr. Frank Musah Dean as the best decision that would serve the interests of Liberia and the country’s jurisprudence. “As we are in the phase of transition, we believe that the learned Cllr. has all it takes to occupy such a post judging from his past and present performances. Cllr. Musah Dean Jr. over the past six years of the Weah-led administration has demonstrated competence, capability, and professionalism in discharging his duties as Minister of Justice of the Republic of Liberia. “Our findings have proven that the Minister has always stood his ground and has never wavered or succumbed to external influence in terms of ensuring that the right thing is done.” The statement also said, “Notably, Cllr. Musah Dean Jr., during his tenure as Justice Minister and Attorney General of the Republic of Liberia, was steadfast in making insightful impacts such as seeking extradition for alleged gun smugglers, being unbiased in the dispensation of justice, and issuing a non-restriction on the enjoyment of constitutional rights.” They also claimed that it was under the watch of Cllr. Frank Musa Dean Jr. that several mass protests and demonstrations were staged by major opposition blocs peacefully without any major casualties, incidents, or accidents, even if they did not seek permission from the Ministry of Justice. “With these references, LIMITA and its Board of Directors can safely assure the public that Cllr. Frank Musa Dean Jr. will discharge his duties without fear, intimidation, or external influence. “Therefore, we urge the Liberian Senate, the body that is responsible for confirmation, to kindly do the needful by confirming this noble and humble man so that he continues to contribute to the growth and development of Mama Liberia. We are of the strongest conviction that Cllr. Musah Dean Jr. is indeed the right choice to fill in that void.",
