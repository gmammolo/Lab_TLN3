  "text": "The Saskatchewan health ministry and Prairie Harm Reduction (PHR) have issued a new drug alert for Saskatoon and surrounding areas, including the R.M. of Blucher, Corman Park, Warman, Martensville, Dundurn, Aberdeen and Vanscoy.\nAccording to recent testing done by PHR, the drug in question is sold as fentanyl, but actually contains parafluorofentanyl, which can be more potent.\nRead more:\nAccording to PHR’s social media post on July 2, the drug also contains other potentially deadly ingredients, including benzodiazepines and xylazine.\n“When paraflurofentanyl is mixed with xylazine (a veterinary tranquillizer) and benzodiazepine (like clonazapam or alprazolam), the combination creates a highly toxic and dangerous cocktail.\n“Each of these substances on their own is dangerous. Together they significantly increase the risk of fatal overdose, especially through respiratory depression,” it read.\nThe material looks like purple chunks and is smoked.\nIn an alert sent out on July 2, 2025, the drug in question was described as purple chunks and is being sold as fentanyl. (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health)\nPHR said Xylazine’s risks alone include severe hypotension (slow heart rate) and loss of blood flow to tissues. Long-term use can cause “necrotic skin ulcers.”\nThe health ministry and PHR advise that naloxone can reverse the effects of the opioids in the drug, but will not have any effect on the mixed drugs.\nDespite naloxone having no impact on the mixed drugs’ effects, it’s still advised to use naloxone in the case of an overdose, as it can restore breathing.",
