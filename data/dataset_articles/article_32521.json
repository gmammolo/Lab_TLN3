  "text": "Lyssavirus alert: NSW Health issue warning after man dies from rabies-like bat virus with no cure\nA man in northern NSW has died after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus — the first confirmed human case in the state and only the fourth in the country.\nThe news comes after NSW Health issued a statement this week that the man, in his 50s, had received treatment after a bat bit him several months ago.\nWhile more than 100 people were assessed last year after being bitten or scratched by bats in NSW, none resulted in infection — until now.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\n“It is incredibly rare for the virus to transmit to humans, but once symptoms of lyssavirus start in people who are scratched or bitten by an infected bat, sadly, there is no effective treatment,” Keira Glasgow, a director in health protection at NSW Health, said on Wednesday.\nMs Glasgow urged the public to assume any bat in Australia could carry the virus and warned that only trained and vaccinated wildlife workers should handle them.\nLyssavirus infections are extremely rare but deadly.\nThe disease causes severe neurological symptoms similar to rabies and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.\nAnyone who suffers a wound inflicted by a bat is urged to seek urgent medical care. The injured area should be thoroughly washed with soap and water for 15 minutes, followed by the application of an antiviral antiseptic, such as betadine, and left to dry.\nFurther treatment with rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine is critical to prevent infection.\nSince 1996, there have been only three other human cases of Australian bat lyssavirus — all of them fatal.\nMore to come.",
