  "text": "For years, patients and visitors at Melur Government Hospital in Madurai district have been plagued by repeated invasions by monkeys, turning hospital visits into nerve-wracking experiences. Despite multiple rescue operations and relocations, the monkey population continues to resurface, especially during late mornings.\nBelieved to have migrated from forest zones near Alagarkoil, these monkeys have now made the hospital blocks their daily haunt. “They swing between wards, rummage through garbage, and startle patients. They show up almost like clockwork between 10 am and noon,” said Vijayamohan, who was attending to a patient.\nSathyamoorthy, a regular visitor to the hospital’s maternal care centre, added, “They attempt to snatch our bags. It’s only when staff arrive with sticks that they flee. Even after being caught once, they come back. Now, they’re everywhere in the hospital.”\nHospital officials confirmed that while no attacks have occurred, fear among patients and staff is growing. Over ₹40,000 has been spent on cages, and several monkeys were relocated with forest department assistance. However, the issue resurfaces due to patients and attendants continuing to feed them.\nDistrict Forest Officer Tarun Kumar acknowledged the repeated rescues. “Relocated monkeys often return because people still feed them. We’re planning an awareness campaign and will address this in upcoming district-level meetings,” he said.\nOfficials now stress that public cooperation is essential to ending this monkey menace.",
