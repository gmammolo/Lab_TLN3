  "text": "A 39-year-old man has been arrested for driving while under the influence of a drug or an intoxicating substance after crashing his car into a central road divider along Race Course Road towards Tessensohn Road on Sunday night (June 29).\nHe then reversed the vehicle and rammed another section of the barrier before crossing over to the opposite side of the road, mounting the pavement and ending up on a grass verge.\nNo one was injured in the incident, which occurred at 11.09pm.\nThe driver was later arrested by police officers who arrived at the scene.\nA 42-second video of the incident circulating on Facebook on Wednesday morning (July 2) shows the white Toyota C-HR Hybrid with its front wheels resting on the central divider.\nThe driver proceeds to reverse his car, knocking down a row of guardrails.\nHe then reverses to the opposite side of the road before mounting the pavement, and eventually coming to a stop on a grass verge.\nThe Straits Times reported that the car in the video is owned by M Label Rental. The driver signed a six-month lease for the car just last month.\nIn response to queries from Lianhe Zaobao, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed that it was alerted to the incident at 11.10pm on June 29.\nParamedics assessed the situation on site and confirmed that no medical assistance was required.\nThe Singapore Police Force also confirmed that the 39-year-old male driver was arrested for suspected drug-related offences.\nInvestigations are ongoing.\nEthel TsengJournalist Read articles by Ethel Tseng",
