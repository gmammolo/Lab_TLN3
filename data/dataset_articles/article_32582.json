  "text": "Most of us don’t notice it right away. It creeps in slowly, disguised as fatigue or irritability. You start to dread Monday a little more than usual. Your to-do list feels heavier. You’re physically present in meetings but mentally miles away. You tell yourself you’re just tired, that things will get better after the weekend, after the next deadline, after the next vacation.But sometimes, it’s not just a bad week. Sometimes, it’s something deeper, the quiet kind of burnout or breakdown that doesn’t make noise but chips away at you, day after day.In the workplace, where professionalism is prized and vulnerability is often hidden behind a tight-lipped smile, mental health struggles rarely look dramatic. They look like people showing up on time, getting things done, and slowly fading from the inside.The early signs we often missNot every breakdown comes with tears or visible distress. In fact, some of the clearest signs are subtle and easy to ignore. You might feel more tired even after a full night’s sleep. You might start avoiding conversations, meetings, or emails. Work that once felt manageable now feels overwhelming, and you find yourself procrastinating or zoning out.Your motivation disappears. You stop caring about things you once took pride in: Your presentation, your punctuality, your performance. Mistakes become more frequent. Not because you’re careless, but because your brain is overloaded. Everything begins to feel like too much, and nothing feels good enough.And yet, to the outside world, you still look “fine.”Emotional detachment and the false sense of functioningOne of the trickiest parts of mental health issues at work is the ability to function while falling apart inside. You attend meetings. You respond to emails. You deliver projects. You smile when someone cracks a joke. But none of it feels real.You’re not connecting with others or with your own work. The passion you once had, even if it was just a small sense of satisfaction, is gone. You feel numb, emotionally flat. It’s like moving through your day in grayscale, while everyone else seems to be living in full color.This detachment can last for weeks or months before anyone notices, including you.The cost of staying silentMany employees hesitate to talk about what they’re going through because they’re afraid it will be seen as weakness or that it will affect how their competence is perceived. But silence often leads to deeper exhaustion. When you’re carrying stress without support, the weight doesn’t just stay on your shoulders, it spreads into your body, your relationships, and eventually your physical health.Left unchecked, chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system. What begins as emotional discomfort can easily turn into something more serious.What can you do if you feel yourself slipping?Check in with yourself honestly. Start by asking: Am I tired, or am I empty? Am I working hard, or am I barely holding it together? Don’t brush off your answers. You owe yourself that honesty.Talk to someone, a colleague, a friend, a therapist. You don’t have to reveal everything. Even saying, “I’m having a rough time lately,” can open the door to support.Set real boundaries. If work is bleeding into your evenings, your sleep, or your ability to recharge, something has to change. Start small. Log off on time. Say no when you’re at capacity. Rest without guilt.Seek professional help if things feel too heavy. Therapists and counselors aren’t just for when everything falls apart. They’re there to help you before it gets that far.Mental health struggles in the workplace don’t always shout. They often whisper through missed deadlines, forgotten lunches, fake smiles, and empty eyes. The sooner you notice the signs, the better your chances of healing before the damage deepens.So pay attention to yourself. You’re not lazy. You’re not weak. You’re human. And there’s no shame in needing a moment to breathe, step back, or ask for help. The job will still be there. But your peace of mind? That has to come first.",
