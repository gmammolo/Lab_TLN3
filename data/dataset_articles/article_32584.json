  "text": "OREGON, USA — Oregon health officials are urging parents and caregivers to avoid a recalled baby food after two cases of lead poisoning were detected in the state, according to a statement from the Oregon Health Authority (OHA).\nOHA reported Wednesday that \"two cases of elevated blood lead levels in babies were detected in Oregon\" and that \"during interviews with the families, investigators determined the children consumed the flavor affected by the recall.\"\nThe cases involve Good & Gather Baby Pea, Zucchini and Kale Thyme Vegetable Puree, which were recalled in March by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. OHA said \"the cases followed a recall alert in March of more than 25,000 packages\" of the baby food sold in 4-ounce containers.\nGood & Gather is a Target store brand, and according to the Oregon Health Authority, \"the product was sold nationwide at the company's stores.\" The FDA has classified the recall as a Class II event, which the health authority said \"means that use of or exposure to this product 'may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,' but the probability of serious health impacts is low.\"\nWhile the FDA recall is considered \"terminated,\" OHA warned that \"the product has a best use date of December 2025, so there may be families with the product still in their homes.\"\nOHA's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program Coordinator Ryan Barker, emphasized the particular danger lead poses to young children.\n\"While lead is toxic for all people regardless of age, small children are especially at risk because they're still growing and developing,\" said Barker. \"Continued exposure over time can permanently damage their central nervous system, which may result in long-term health problems, such as learning disorders, impaired speech and brain damage.\"\nOHA noted that lead is of special concern for babies, toddlers and children because even small amounts of lead may affect behavior, cognitive development and academic achievement, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nHealth officials warned that lead poisoning symptoms can be difficult to identify. OHA said \"signs of lead poisoning are not always easy to see and can be mistaken for other illnesses\" and that \"without a blood test, lead poisoning may go undiagnosed, especially since affected children often don't look or act sick.\"\nPossible symptoms according to OHA include:\n- Tiredness or loss of energy\n- Hyperactivity\n- Reduced attention span\n- Irritability or crankiness\n- Poor appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Trouble sleeping\n- Constipation\n- Stomach aches or pains\nThe health authority reported that last year Oregon had 361 lead poisoning cases in children, with 237 affecting children younger than 6. The agency said that while \"the most common cases are due to ingesting paint and paint dust containing lead,\" exposures from \"traditional cosmetics, glazed pottery, and informally imported spices have been identified.\"\nOregon health care providers and laboratories are required by law to report elevated and non-elevated lead test results to local health departments or the Oregon Health Authority.",
