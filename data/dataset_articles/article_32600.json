  "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Christina Lake Cannabis Corp. (\" CLC \" or the \" Company \") (CSE: CLC) announced today that it will not be filing its annual financial statements, accompanying management's discussion and analysis and related chief executive officer (\" CEO \") and chief financial officer (\" CFO \") certifications for the financial year ended February 28, 2025 (collectively, the \" Annual Filings \"), within the period prescribed for the filing of such documents under Parts 4, 5 and 6 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations and pursuant to National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings , namely within 120 days of year-end, being June 30, 2025 (the \" Filing Deadline \").\nThe delay at CLC is due to the audit taking longer than expected, primarily because of the high level of testing required and the limited availability of staff resources. The Company's material item on its balance sheet is inventory and biological assets. Given the increased production levels over the past year and the introduction of additional product lines following the Midway acquisition, the process of costing and inventory allocation is taking longer than originally anticipated. Further, the financings completed in connection with the Midway acquisition earlier in 2024 have added to the workload, requiring additional time to ensure accuracy of the financial statements.\nCLC is working closely with its auditor DMCL LLP and is making every effort to submit the Annual Filings in a timely fashion and expects to file no later than July 14, 2025, and will issue a news release announcing the completion of such filings at that time.\nCLC CEO Mark Aiken stated, \"We support the provision of extra time to allow auditors to satisfactorily complete the 2024 audit and ensure that the financial statements are accurate in all respects.\"\nThe Company is providing this default announcement in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders (\" NP 12-203 \"). The Company has made an application to the British Columbia Securities Commission, as principal regulator of the Company, a management cease trade order (\" MCTO \") under NP 12-203 in respect of the default regarding the Annual Filings. The MCTO will prohibit the CEO and the CFO from trading in securities of CLC for so long as the Annual Filings are not filed. The issuance of the MCTO, if issued, does not affect the ability of persons other than the CEO and the CFO of the Company to trade in the Company's securities. The application for the MCTO remains subject to the risk factors described in \" Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors \" below, including the risk that the MCTO application may not be successful or may not be completed prior to a securities commission issuing a failure-to-file cease trade order against the Company following the Filing Deadline.\nThe Company confirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines found at sections 9 and 10 of NP 12-203 respecting Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults for so long as it remains in default as a result of the late filing of the Annual Filings. During the period of default, the Company will issue biweekly default status reports in the form of further news releases, which will also be filed on SEDAR. The Company confirms that there are no insolvency proceedings against it as of the date of this news release. The Company also confirms that there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed as of the date of this news release.\nABOUT CLC\nChristina Lake Cannabis is a licensed producer of cannabis under the Cannabis Act. It has secured a standard cultivation license and corresponding processing amendment from Health Canada (March 2020 and August 2020, respectively) as well as a research and development license (early 2020). Christina Lake Cannabis' facility consists of a 32-acre property, which includes over 950,000 square feet of outdoor grow space, offices, propagation and drying rooms, research facilities, and a facility dedicated to processing and extraction. Christina Lake Cannabis also owns a 99-acre plot of land adjoining its principal site. CLC focuses its production on creating high quality extracts and distillate for its B2B client base with proprietary strains specifically developed for outdoor cultivation to enhance extraction quality.",
