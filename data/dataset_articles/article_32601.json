  "text": "ESPAÑOLA, N.M. (KRQE) – A northern New Mexico animal shelter is asking the public for help after discovering a mold issue in its dog kennels. “Our cat area is not affected, our office area is not affected, our clinic is not affected, our exam rooms are not affected; it is only in the dog kennel area,” said Mattie Allen, Director of Communications, Española Humane. Staff at Española Humane said they discovered the mold two days ago and suspect it came from a leaky roof. Allen said the animals are safe and were quickly relocated after the mold was found. However, repairs and cleanup come with a hefty price tag. It’s something the nonprofit said they’re struggling to cover by themselves. “It’s going to be very costly to try and repair this roof and do all this remediation,” said Allen. The shelter is asking for donations, but more importantly, if you’re thinking of adopting, it could help free up some space and lessen the load on staff. “Fostering and adoption is going to be really important. Although we have no plans to move animals off the site, we’re definitely going to be limited in space,” said Allen. To donate to Española Humane, click this link .
