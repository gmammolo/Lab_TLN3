  "text": "As maternal and infant deaths hit alarming numbers nationwide over the last several years, there’s been a concerted effort in New Jersey to bring down its rate of unnecessary cesarean or C-sections.\nA new analysis by the Rutgers School of Public Health indicates those efforts seem to be working.\n“In general, in the U.S., the rate of cesarean birth has been rising,” said Slawa Rokicki, assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health who led the analysis. “It’s gone up from about 20% back in the 90s to now at about a third of births, and the worry there is that many of these are unnecessary cesareans …\n“When women have cesarean deliveries, they are at higher risk of some poor outcomes, complications like infection or blood clots, complications of anesthesia and surgery,” she said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “There’s also an emotional toll from having unnecessary surgery. So, there’s quite a few negative outcomes, and no real benefits for these low-risk cesarean deliveries.”\nBut Rokicki said New Jersey has had more success in bringing the numbers down than other states.\n“It is a substantial drop when compared to other states,” she said. “There’s been a range of policies that [the state’s] Nurture NJ has implemented. For example, one of the ones is prohibiting coverage of elective cesareans in certain non-medically indicated situations … That’s been an important factor in in this drop.”",
