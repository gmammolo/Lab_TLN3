  "text": "Fraud schemes involving assisted living residents were among those exposed in the Justice Department’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown , the results of which were announced this week.\nThe DOJ said that its “record-breaking results” saw criminal charges brought against 324 defendants for their alleged participation in healthcare fraud schemes totaling $14.6 billion and illustrated the need for providers to stay hypervigilant in their compliance efforts.\nTwo of the cases involved assisted living.\nIn Texas, three hospice company operators were indicted in an alleged $110 million healthcare fraud and kickback scheme involving Houston-area assisted living communities or group homes and a local psychiatric hospital.\nDera Ogudo and Victoria Martinez, who owned and operated United Palliative & Hospice Care as well as Residential Hospice and Cedar Hospice, are accused of misleading residents about services billed to their Medicare and Medicaid plans.\nProsecutors allege that at Ogudo’s direction, marketers went into assisted living communities in and around Houston to make presentations to residents and obtain clients for UPHC. Ogudo reportedly instructed marketers to tell residents that they would receive palliative or home health services while UPHC billed Medicare and Medicaid for hospice services. In exchange, Ogudo allegedly paid markets $500 per referral.\nAt Ogudo’s direction, prosecutors allege, UPHC employees exaggerated and falsified individuals’ medical conditions in medical records to make it appear that they were terminally ill and that their health was deteriorating, when that was not true.\nOgudo also is accused of paying kickbacks to Evelyn Shaw, a discharge coordinator at a local psychiatric hospital, in exchange for referrals.\nOgudo and Martinez received a warning letter from Medicare contractor Qlarant in July 2022 that their billing and documentation were improper, but the two continued to enroll unqualified patients and bill Medicare for fraudulent hospice services, according to the Justice Department. When Ogudo, Martinez and Shaw became aware of a criminal investigation into UPHC in January 2024, they allegedly conspired to continue their fraudulent scheme by moving dozens of UPHC patients’ enrollments to Cedar Hospice and Residential Hospice.\nProsecutors allege that their plan involved illegal kickbacks and bribes to marketers and group home owners and occurred from 2019 to 2025. UPHC, Residential Hospice and Cedar Hospice billed Medicare and Medicaid for more than $110 million and were paid more than $87 million for hospice services, according to the DOJ. The government said it seized more than $5 million in bank accounts and properties.\nNarcotics fraud uncovered Meanwhile, in Indiana, a qualified medication aid was charged with three felony counts and a misdemeanor for not providing narcotics medications to assisted living residents at Silver Birch of Kokomo, Kokomo, IN.\nLindsay Anne Plake was charged with felony counts of obtaining a controlled substance by fraud, furnishing false or fraudulent information, and failure to make, keep or furnish a record. She also faces a misdemeanor theft charge.\nPlake allegedly diverted medication, including oxycodone and hydrocodone, from residents and documented false information regarding the administration of those medications between Aug. 1 and Oct. 31, 2024.\nAccording to the DOJ, during an inventory count on a shift change, two other medication aids noticed that Plake had an “unusually high number” of withdrawals of controlled substances from the medication cart for three residents. An internal investigation reportedly confirmed that Plake withdrew controlled substances 26 times from the med cart but that those medications were not provided to the residents.\nPlake’s employment was terminated and the case was turned over to the Elwood Police Department and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Indiana Office of Attorney General, the DOJ said.",
