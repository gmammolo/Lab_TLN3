The deceased were identified as Selvaraj (57), Sumanraj (15), and Gokulraj (13). The generator had been running overnight in the room where they slept.\nOn Wednesday morning, Selvaraj's wife—who lives in a separate house in the same neighbourhood—found them unconscious with froth around their mouths. The Puzhal police registered a case and sent the bodies to Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital for autopsy.\nInitially, police suspected suicide due to the frothing, but the autopsy confirmed carbon monoxide poisoning as the cause of death.\nIn another news, an explosion at a fireworks factory in Tamil Nadu’s Sivakasi town on Monday left at least five people dead, including a woman, and several others severely injured. Eyewitnesses described a scene of horror as thick black smoke billowed into the sky, with crackers continuously bursting inside the premises even after the initial explosion. Rescue teams rushed to the spot to pull out the injured, some of whom were badly burnt and crying for help. Sivakasi, often referred to as the firecracker capital of India, has seen similar accidents in the past due to inadequate safety measures and overcrowded workspaces.\nEnd of Article",
