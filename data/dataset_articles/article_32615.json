They asked about sleep quality, types of food eaten, eating timings, and dream experiences. The findings were striking.\nAbout 33% of the students reported experiencing regular\nMany respondents noticed that their\nAbout 25% specifically said that certain food items made their sleep worse. While only 5.5% of participants believed that food impacted the tone of their dreams, the majority of those individuals blamed dairy and sweets, with spicy foods also commonly mentioned. Many said these foods made their dreams more disturbing or bizarre.\nDr Tore Nielsen, the lead researcher from Université de Montréal, said, “Nightmare severity is robustly associated with lactose intolerance and other food allergies. These new findings imply that changing eating habits for people with some food sensitivities could alleviate nightmares. They could also explain why people so often blame dairy for bad dreams!”\nThe study further explored eating behaviour using the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), a tool developed by the Frontiers Research Foundation. The NEQ includes items that assess psychological and behavioural patterns related to evening and night-time eating. Participants answered questions like, “Do you have cravings or urges to eat snacks when you wake up at night?” and “Do you need to eat to get back to\nThe results showed two main patterns: night-eating (eating after waking up in the night) and evening-eating (eating after supper but before bed). Both habits were linked to lower sleep quality and more negative dreams. Those who reported eating unhealthy snacks, especially at night, were more likely to have unpleasant dreams and were less likely to remember them.\n“Nightmares are worse for lactose-intolerant people who suffer severe gastrointestinal symptoms and whose sleep is disrupted. This makes sense, because we know that other bodily sensations can affect dreaming,” Dr Nielsen said.\n“We are routinely asked whether food affects dreaming, especially by journalists on food-centric holidays. Now, we have some answers,” he added.\nThis study highlights a growing area of sleep research. It shows that for people with food sensitivities, especially to dairy and sweets, adjusting dietary habits could improve both sleep and dream quality.\nScientists from Université de Montréal surveyed over 1,000 university students to explore the connection between food habits and dreaming.

Women, in particular, were more affected. They were almost twice as likely as men to report food intolerances or allergies and also more likely to report poor sleep and dream recall, suggested the study published in Frontiers in Psychology.\nMany respondents noticed that their\nsleepwas influenced by what and when they ate.
