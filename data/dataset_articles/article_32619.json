  "text": "Christina Lake Cannabis Announces Delay in Filing its 2024 Annual Financial Statements\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE: CLC) has announced a delay in filing its annual financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2025. The company will miss the June 30, 2025 filing deadline due to extended audit requirements and resource constraints.\nThe delay is primarily attributed to increased testing needs for inventory and biological assets, complicated by higher production levels and new product lines following the Midway acquisition. The company expects to file by July 14, 2025 and has applied for a Management Cease Trade Order (MCTO) that would restrict trading by the CEO and CFO until the filings are complete.\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE: CLC) ha annunciato un ritardo nella presentazione del bilancio annuale relativo all'esercizio chiuso al 28 febbraio 2025. La società non riuscirà a rispettare la scadenza del 30 giugno 2025 a causa di requisiti di revisione più estesi e limitazioni delle risorse.\nIl ritardo è principalmente dovuto a maggiori esigenze di verifica per l'inventario e le attività biologiche, complicate da livelli di produzione più elevati e nuove linee di prodotto conseguenti all'acquisizione di Midway. La società prevede di presentare il bilancio entro il 14 luglio 2025 e ha richiesto un Management Cease Trade Order (MCTO) che limiterà le operazioni di trading del CEO e CFO fino al completamento delle presentazioni.\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE: CLC) ha anunciado un retraso en la presentación de sus estados financieros anuales correspondientes al año cerrado el 28 de febrero de 2025. La compañía no cumplirá con la fecha límite del 30 de junio de 2025 debido a requerimientos de auditoría extendidos y limitaciones de recursos.\nEl retraso se atribuye principalmente a mayores necesidades de pruebas para inventarios y activos biológicos, complicadas por niveles de producción más altos y nuevas líneas de productos tras la adquisición de Midway. La empresa espera presentar los estados financieros antes del 14 de julio de 2025 y ha solicitado una Orden de Suspensión de Comercio para la Dirección (MCTO) que restringirá las operaciones de trading del CEO y CFO hasta que se completen las presentaciones.\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE: CLC)는 2025년 2월 28일 종료된 회계연도 연례 재무제표 제출이 지연됨을 발표했습니다. 회사는 확장된 감사 요구사항과 자원 제한으로 인해 2025년 6월 30일 제출 기한을 맞추지 못할 것입니다.\n지연의 주요 원인은 재고 및 생물학적 자산에 대한 추가 검사 필요성으로, Midway 인수 이후 생산량 증가와 신제품 라인으로 인해 복잡해졌습니다. 회사는 2025년 7월 14일까지 제출할 예정이며, 제출 완료 시까지 CEO와 CFO의 거래를 제한하는 경영진 거래 중지 명령(MCTO)을 신청했습니다.\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE : CLC) a annoncé un retard dans le dépôt de ses états financiers annuels pour l'exercice clos le 28 février 2025. La société ne respectera pas la date limite du 30 juin 2025 en raison d'exigences d'audit prolongées et de contraintes de ressources.\nCe retard est principalement dû à des besoins accrus de vérification des stocks et des actifs biologiques, compliqués par des niveaux de production plus élevés et de nouvelles gammes de produits suite à l'acquisition de Midway. La société prévoit de déposer ses états financiers d'ici le 14 juillet 2025 et a demandé une ordonnance de suspension de négociation de la direction (MCTO) qui restreindra les transactions du PDG et du directeur financier jusqu'à la finalisation des dépôts.\nChristina Lake Cannabis (CSE: CLC) hat eine Verzögerung bei der Einreichung des Jahresabschlusses für das zum 28. Februar 2025 endende Geschäftsjahr angekündigt. Das Unternehmen wird die Frist zum 30. Juni 2025 aufgrund erhöhter Prüfungsanforderungen und Ressourcenengpässen nicht einhalten können.\nDie Verzögerung ist hauptsächlich auf den erhöhten Prüfungsaufwand für Inventar und biologische Vermögenswerte zurückzuführen, der durch höhere Produktionsmengen und neue Produktlinien nach der Midway-Übernahme erschwert wird. Das Unternehmen plant die Einreichung bis zum 14. Juli 2025 und hat einen Management Cease Trade Order (MCTO) beantragt, der den Handel durch den CEO und CFO bis zum Abschluss der Einreichungen einschränkt.\n- None.\n- Delay in filing annual financial statements beyond regulatory deadline\n- Management Cease Trade Order (MCTO) application restricting CEO and CFO trading\n- Resource constraints affecting audit completion\n- Increased complexity in financial reporting due to Midway acquisition\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, July 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Christina Lake Cannabis Corp. (\"CLC\" or the \"Company\") (CSE: CLC) announced today that it will not be filing its annual financial statements, accompanying management's discussion and analysis and related chief executive officer (\"CEO\") and chief financial officer (\"CFO\") certifications for the financial year ended February 28, 2025 (collectively, the \"Annual Filings\"), within the period prescribed for the filing of such documents under Parts 4, 5 and 6 of National Instrument 51-102 Continuous Disclosure Obligations and pursuant to National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings, namely within 120 days of year-end, being June 30, 2025 (the \"Filing Deadline\").\nThe delay at CLC is due to the audit taking longer than expected, primarily because of the high level of testing required and the limited availability of staff resources. The Company's material item on its balance sheet is inventory and biological assets. Given the increased production levels over the past year and the introduction of additional product lines following the Midway acquisition, the process of costing and inventory allocation is taking longer than originally anticipated. Further, the financings completed in connection with the Midway acquisition earlier in 2024 have added to the workload, requiring additional time to ensure accuracy of the financial statements.\nCLC is working closely with its auditor DMCL LLP and is making every effort to submit the Annual Filings in a timely fashion and expects to file no later than July 14, 2025, and will issue a news release announcing the completion of such filings at that time.\nCLC CEO Mark Aiken stated, \"We support the provision of extra time to allow auditors to satisfactorily complete the 2024 audit and ensure that the financial statements are accurate in all respects.\"\nThe Company is providing this default announcement in accordance with National Policy 12-203 Management Cease Trade Orders (\"NP 12-203\"). The Company has made an application to the British Columbia Securities Commission, as principal regulator of the Company, a management cease trade order (\"MCTO\") under NP 12-203 in respect of the default regarding the Annual Filings. The MCTO will prohibit the CEO and the CFO from trading in securities of CLC for so long as the Annual Filings are not filed. The issuance of the MCTO, if issued, does not affect the ability of persons other than the CEO and the CFO of the Company to trade in the Company's securities. The application for the MCTO remains subject to the risk factors described in \"Forward Looking Information and Risk Factors\" below, including the risk that the MCTO application may not be successful or may not be completed prior to a securities commission issuing a failure-to-file cease trade order against the Company following the Filing Deadline.\nThe Company confirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines found at sections 9 and 10 of NP 12-203 respecting Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults for so long as it remains in default as a result of the late filing of the Annual Filings. During the period of default, the Company will issue biweekly default status reports in the form of further news releases, which will also be filed on SEDAR. The Company confirms that there are no insolvency proceedings against it as of the date of this news release. The Company also confirms that there is no other material information concerning the affairs of the Company that has not been generally disclosed as of the date of this news release.\nABOUT CLC\nChristina Lake Cannabis is a licensed producer of cannabis under the Cannabis Act.
