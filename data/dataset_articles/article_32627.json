  "text": "— More than 11,300 Kia Niro electric vehicles are recalled because of backup camera problems.\nThe recalled 2020-2022 Kia Niro EVs are equipped with circuit boards for the rearview cameras that may become damaged and cause backup camera image failures.\nThe problem was discovered in December 2024 during a routine review of field data which showed a problem with rearview camera warranty replacement claims for 2022 Niro electric vehicles.\nKia engineers and the supplier inspected the backup cameras that had been replaced\nSeven of nine rearview cameras showed signs of damage to various printed circuit board components possibly due to voltage surges. But no damage was found in the other two cameras.\nEventually engineers saw a voltage surge related to a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, and Kia determined the display screen could appear blank or green.\nThe Niro EV backup camera failures are caused by damage from voltage surges in the rearview camera power circuits.\nThe Kia Niro EV backup cameras will be replaced by dealerships after recall letters are mailed August 19, 2025.\nKia Niro EV owners may call 800-333-4542 and refer to backup camera recall number SC342.",
