  "text": "AI Chatbots: A Breeding Ground for Health Misinformation\nAustralian researchers discovered that AI chatbots can be manipulated to provide false health information with convincing credibility, using fake citations from real medical journals. They emphasize the need for improved internal safeguards to prevent these tools from spreading dangerous misinformation at scale.\nIn a concerning development, Australian researchers have found that widely used AI chatbots can easily be manipulated to deliver false health information. These responses, which appear credible and authoritative, are even accompanied by fake citations from genuine medical journals.\nThe study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, highlights a significant flaw in the current design of these AI tools. Researchers warn that without enhanced internal controls, these chatbots could become prolific sources of dangerous health misinformation.\nThis alarming discovery underlines the urgent need for technology developers to implement robust safeguards. Ensuring the integrity of AI systems is crucial to prevent the dissemination of potentially harmful information to the public.\n(With inputs from agencies.)",
