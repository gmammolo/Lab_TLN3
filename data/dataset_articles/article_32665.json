  "text": "Many believe that once cancer treatment ends, the worst is over. But Princess Catherine has pointed out that the reality is far more complicated.\nDuring a recent appearance at Colchester Hospital on July 2, the Princess of Wales opened up about the challenges she’s faced in remission, shedding light on the quiet struggles many patients endure long after their final round of treatment.\n“You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment’s done, then it’s like, ‘I can crack on, get back to normal,’ but actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult,” she explained.\n“You’re not necessarily under the clinical team any longer, but you’re not able to function normally at home as you perhaps once used to.\n“And actually, someone to help talk you through that, show you and guide you through that sort of phase that comes after treatment, I think is really valuable.\n“You have to find your new normal and that takes time…and it’s a roller coaster, it’s not smooth, like you expect it to be. But the reality is you go through hard times.”\nCatherine stunned the world when she revealed that she had been diagnosed with cancer and was undergoing preventative chemotherapy , following major abdominal surgery in early 2024.\nAfter months of treatment, the Princess recently shared the uplifting news that she is now in remission. Earlier this year, she made her first solo public appearance since stepping back from royal duties during a visit to The Royal Marsden Hospital—the specialist centre where she had been receiving care.\nThe visit was especially meaningful as she met with patients and medical staff, and announced she had taken on the role of joint patron of the specialist cancer hospital alongside Prince William.\nShe later took to social media to reflect on the moment and express her gratitude.\n“I wanted to take the opportunity to say thank you to The Royal Marsden for looking after me so well during the past year,” she began.\n“My heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything.\n“We couldn’t have asked for more. The care and advice we have received throughout my time as a patient has been exceptional.\n“In my new role as Joint Patron of The Royal Marsden, my hope is, that by supporting groundbreaking research and clinical excellence, as well as promoting patient and family wellbeing, we might save many more lives, and transform the experience of all those impacted by cancer.\n“It is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focussed on recovery. As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal. I am however looking forward to a fulfilling year ahead. There is much to look forward to. Thank you to everyone for your continued support. C.”\n-with Reuters.",
