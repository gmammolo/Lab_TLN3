  "text": "Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh): The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the state government to file separate FIRs for each death, provide ₹10 lakh compensation to each bereaved family, and suspend the licence of Mission Hospital, Damoh, after revelations that an unqualified man posing as a UK-based heart specialist caused multiple patient deaths.\nIn its order dated July 1, the NHRC held the state accountable for gross negligence after it was found that Narendra Vikramaditya Yadav, masquerading as renowned cardiologist Dr. N John Camm, conducted at least 15 cardiac procedures between December 2024 and February 2025, resulting in deaths of seven patients.\nThe NHRC conducted an on-site inquiry from April 7 to 9, prompted by local whistleblowers. Investigations confirmed that Yadav had no medical qualification and his claimed alma mater, North Bengal Medical College, denied any record of him.\nFurther inquiry revealed that the hospital fraudulently used the credentials of Dr. Akhilesh Dubey to obtain a licence for its Cath Lab without his knowledge or consent. Despite the magnitude of the incident, only one FIR had initially been filed.\nMoreover, the hospital exploited Ayushman Bharat scheme, illegally charging patients up to ₹2.5 lakh for procedures that were supposed to be free. Patients’ Ayushman cards were seized at admission, and no refunds or medical reports were issued, violating both patient rights and government healthcare norms.\nThe NHRC also ordered a probe into the misuse of Nazul land where the hospital is situated. The Director General of Police has been instructed to register individual FIRs for each death and ensure thorough investigation.",
