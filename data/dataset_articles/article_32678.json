  "text": "Letters submitted by BDN readers are verified by BDN Opinion Page staff. Send your letters to letters@bangordailynews.com Let’s say they’re right, that millions of people will be kicked off Medicaid under the Big Beautiful Bill. Nevermind the claims that the bill will result in more than 50,000 people a year dying from preventable causes. The question becomes, who will absorb the financial impact of this bill? Let’s do the math. Most of Maine’s rural hospitals — those in Houlton, Millinocket, Calais, Machias, Lincoln, Greenville, Skowhegan, Pittsfield, Blue Hill, Mount Desert, Rumford, Norway, Bridgton, Damariscotta, Dover-Foxcroft and Belfast — are designated Critical Access Hospitals. As such, they are required by law to provide, at a minimum, a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to anyone who needs immediate medical care, regardless of ability to pay. The Big Beautiful Bill will result in more people without health insurance, not able to afford preventative care and depending on emergency rooms. Emergency room bills are more costly than preventable care and leave hospitals in the position of eating the bills. If you think our hospitals are struggling now, just wait until the Big Beautiful Bill comes into law. Thank you to Sen. Susan Collins for her thoughtful “no” vote on the bill.
