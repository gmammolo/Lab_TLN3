  "text": "West Washoe Valley communities are challenged by the ever-present threat of wildfires. On Oct. 14, 2016 , the intentionally set \"controlled burn\" by the Nevada Division of Forestry reignited in high winds. Twenty-three homes were destroyed in its wake, dubbed the \"Little Valley Wildfire.\" Fire protection and emergency medical services in West Washoe Valley are the responsibility of the Truckee Meadows Fire Protection District. Washoe Valley property owners pay millions of dollars to the TMFPD each year via the fire tax. In 2019 the TMFPD proposed consolidating stations No. 30 Bowers and No. 32 Eastlake at the north end of the valley with a new superstation, including a staffed medic unit. Land was purchased in February 2020 on White Pelican Way at Old Rte. 395. Construction was to start in 2023 with completion by 2025. The new station’s construction budget was about $6.5 million in 2020. In January 2020 the Board approved the consolidation, with an important stipulation that neither Station No. 32 nor No. 30 would be closed until the new station was operational. When the TMFPD staff recommended an architect and builder, District 2 Commissioner Bob Lucey and Chairman Vaughn Hartung, unhappy with the design costs, ordered the County’s capital projects team to take over the process and re-evaluate the selection of the architect and contractor. In the spring of 2022, the County’s capital projects team returned with their recommendation to utilize the same architect and contractor selected nine months earlier by the TMFPD team. That nine-month delay would see a dramatic increase in costs. Twenty-year bond interest rates soared from 1.25% in January 2021 to 3.75% in October 2022. Bowers was the closest staffed station to West Washoe Valley communities. However, in August of 2022 the station was abandoned due to a bat infestation . West Washoe Valley citizens were outraged and pleaded with the fire commissioners to seek alternatives and to adhere to their earlier promise that this station would not close until the new consolidated station was operational. Nonetheless, on Nov. 1, 2022, the TMFPD Board voted to terminate the Bowers station lease with the NDF. Soon thereafter NDF would use the station for storage of their vehicles and to house seasonal firefighters, spending only $150,000 to make the facility safe. Other TMFPD stations, primarily Eastlake, were assigned to provide coverage to the west Washoe Valley, but crews from there cannot arrive within the prescribed eight-minute response time necessary to preclude destruction of a home from fire or in time to avert a deadly heart attack, Today the construction budget is estimated to exceed $16.3 million. Bob Lucey would later serve Gov. Lombardo briefly in 2024 as Nevada’s \"infrastructure czar,\" teeing up projects to spend the state’s share of the federal Infrastructure Bill’s largesse, but Lucey never supported funding for the Washoe Valley station. The Nevada State Infrastructure Bank also has funds to allocate for the construction of fire stations as a grant or loan, yet no application for the Washoe Valley station’s funding has been submitted by the TMFPD for such consideration. In a May 2025 media interview , interim Fire Chief Dale Way admitted that the Washoe Valley consolidated station will never be built. Alternatives now include first downsizing the station’s design, e.g., Mogul No. 40 and Arrowcreek No. 36, both about 25% smaller. A smaller station would reduce the cost. Solicit bids for construction. Or second, sell the land at White Pelican Way (about $500,000) and use those funds to renovate volunteer Station 301 at Bellevue and I-580 for about $500,000 with a manufactured home as temporary crew quarters, as was done for Hidden Valley No. 37 for 12 years. Freeze capital acquisitions for fiscal year 2026 and use those funds for staffing costs. Today, West Washoe Valley residents are ever vigilant when it comes to wildfires but fear delayed responses by the TMFPD will result in a fire catastrophe or unnecessary deaths.
