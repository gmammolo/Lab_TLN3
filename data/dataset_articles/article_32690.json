  "text": "Steven Bolyard, 63, of Milan, passed away Tuesday, July 1, 2025, at Fisher-Titus Medical Center in Norwalk following a brief illness. He was born September 23, 1961, in West Virginia and had made his home in Milan since 1996. A proud 1980 graduate of South Amherst High School, Steven went on to further his education at Lorain County Community College and the University of Akron, where he earned a degree in engineering. Steven was employed as a Senior Manufacturing Engineer Manager at Beckett Air and had previously dedicated 36 years of service to Invacare. Known for his deep faith, he was a devoted Christian who lived with love, purpose, and a heart full of gratitude. The pride and joy of Steven's life was watching his two sons grow into the men he so deeply admired. He was actively involved in their lives, coaching their baseball teams and sharing his love for golf with them. Steven had many passions, he enjoyed gardening, launched his own salsa company, and was a jack-of-all-trades who was always willing to lend a hand. An animal lover, he shared a special bond with his beloved dog, Hazel Joy. Steven is survived by his devoted wife of 42 years and high school sweetheart, Pamela Bolyard (nee Davidson); his sons, Tyler Bolyard and his wife, Eevee of Los Angeles, California, and Austin Bolyard of Sandusky; his father, Harold Bolyard and his wife, Janet of Vermilion; and his brother, Kendall Bolyard and his wife, Carolyn of Wellington. He was preceded in death by his mother, Edna Ruth (nee DeWitt). Family and friends will be received Saturday, July 5, 2025, from 11 a.m. until the time of funeral services at 1 p.m. in Hempel Funeral Home. Burial will follow in Evergreen Cemetery in South Amherst. Rebroadcasting of services will be available at www.hempelfuneralhome.com In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to a charity of the donor's choice.
