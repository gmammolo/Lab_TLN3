  "text": "The untimely death of model and actress Shefali Jariwala has not only sent shockwaves across the nation but also reignited the conversation of Indian’s obsession with youth, beauty and fairness.\nDuring the investigation, one of the biggest details that came out was Shefali’s unsupervised and long-term usage of skin whitening and anti-ageing treatments, particularly glutathione and Vitamin C.\nShe was taking these treatments for 8 years without active medical supervision after initial consultation, said police sources.\nAs per reports, a stockpile of anti-ageing pills, multivitamins, and glutathione vials was found in Shefali’s room, which was on her table, and even inside her fridge.\nBecause if their benefits like skin brightening, anti-pigmentation effects and signs of reverse-ageing, the popularity of glutathione and Vitamin C has been ever-increasing in India. Not only tablets, these drugs are also sold in the form of intravenous (IV) drips and injections.\nIn 2025, the glutathione market is estimated to be valued at USD 324.6 million and is expected to reach insane USD 585.8 million by 2032.\nDespite the hype, its benefit remains highly doubtful, with long-term medical research suggesting that its usage can have side effects like allergic reactions to kidney and liver complications, with extreme cases, misuse or self-medication can be fatal.\nWhat is the cost of Glutathione and Vitamin C IV drip\nThe cost of these treatments and therapies highly depends on the location, right from metro-cities to other places as per NDTV.\nThe cost can range from Rs 4,000 to Rs 12,000 per session in the clinics of Gurugram, it varies depending on the strength of the dosage and number of sessions. On the other hand, these treatments are sold as packages in Delhi, with a 5-session package costing up to Rs 35,000, while a 10-session plan could set you back nearly Rs 60,000.\nIn Mumbai, the Glutathione IV session starts with Rs 8,000 with at-home service along with a trained medical person. Talking about the packages, a 6-session package is priced at Rs 38,400 while an 18-session package costs around Rs 1,08,000.",
