  "text": "HUNDREDS of students from Pis-anan National High School and Pis-anan Elementary School in Barangay Pis-anan, Sibalom, Antique were hospitalized on July 2, 2025, after reportedly inhaling a strong, foul odor that triggered mass symptoms including dizziness, chest pain, and vomiting.\nFlorence Mathew T. Besares, medical specialist III and psychiatrist from Ramon Maza Sr. Memorial District Hospital (RMSMDH), emphasized that the patients' symptoms should not be dismissed.\n“Let's not just rush to say that there are anxiety disorders (the children who were admitted). You're right, he caused the symptoms in the patients to react in a way that you didn't expect, which is not natural to be allowed to happen,\" Besares said.\nAntique Governor Paolo Javier thanked the medical staff of Angel Salazar Memorial General Hospital (ASMGH), RMSMDH, and other district hospitals for their swift response.\nAs of 11:45 p.m., July 2, 2025, ASMGH reported 88 patients treated, four of whom were admitted. All were in stable condition, and none were in critical status.\nChief Nurse Czerwin Juales of ASMGH urged the public to stay calm and not panic.\nThe Provincial Health Office will offer psychological services to patients at ASMGH and a triage center at Barangay Pis-anan gymnasium, deploying nurses from multiple district hospitals to handle staff shortages.\nGovernor Javier, joined by Congressman Antonio “AA” Legarda Jr. and San Jose Mayor Paul Joseph Untaran, continued monitoring the situation throughout the night and assisted in providing relief, including the distribution of arroz caldo to patients and staff. Additional tents were also set up outside ASMGH, and folding beds were requested from the public to accommodate the influx of patients.\nAround 10 p.m., Lovely Mendoza, an 18-year-old resident of Barangay Mabini, Sibalom, brought her sister Mia, a Grade 10 student, back to the hospital after Mia experienced chest pain and vomited at eight o'clock in the evening. Mia is just among the number of students returning to hospitals after early symptoms returned.\nThis case highlighted a troubling pattern: several students who had previously recovered began returning to the hospital with renewed symptoms.\nDr. Annabelle P. Yumang, regional director of the Department of Health - Center for Health Development in Western Visayas, received an urgent request for additional medical manpower and equipment.\nIn an official letter, Javier requested doctors, nurses, and folding beds to support the overwhelmed hospitals.\nAccording to the Provincial Health Office, initial symptoms reported among students included headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and even fainting. All affected individuals were treated either at RMSMDH or ASMGH.\nAn inter-agency investigation is underway to determine the cause and source of the foul odor. Emergency response teams and health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas, and both hospitals remain on high alert.\nThe public is urged to avoid the vicinity of Barangay Pis-anan while authorities investigate. Residents experiencing symptoms are advised to seek medical care immediately. Officials also cautioned the public against spreading misinformation, which could worsen panic and hysteria.\n“This is a medical emergency. Please refrain from posting fake news or unverified information,” said ASMGH in a public advisory.\nJavier also personally helped transport foam mattresses lent by Delegate Angel Salazar Jr. Memorial School to the third floor of the Provincial Health Office.\nRed alert status\nOn July 2, 2025, the Emergency Operations Center was raised to Red Alert Status to ensure full coordination and immediate medical response. As of 3:45 p.m., a total of 323 patients were recorded and treated across multiple locations:\n- 209 admitted at RMSDH, with 19 treated as outpatients.\n- 32 admitted at ASMGH, with one outpatient.\n- 82 treated on-site at Barangay Pis-anan, and 22 more evaluated at the barangay triage.\nThe symptoms reportedly began between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m., causing widespread panic among students, parents, and faculty. Initial accounts suggest the source was a pungent chemical odor believed to have drifted into classrooms from a nearby insecticide application.\nThe Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) led the coordinated response, supported by:\nOne ambulance with 10 personnel from the Office of the PDRRMO;\nEight ambulances and 14 rescue vehicles from the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Offices (MDRRMO) of Sibalom, Hamtic, San Jose, and Belison with 44 responders;\nFour ambulances from the Rural Health Unit (RHU) and Municipal Health Offices (MHO) of Hamtic and San Jose with 22 personnel;\nSix private vehicles offering voluntary transport;\nTwenty-five personnel from the Department of Health (DOH) in Western Visayas;\nTwo police patrols from the Philippine National Police (PNP) Sibalom and Barangay Pis-anan with 11 officers;\nOne fire truck with five personnel from the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP);\nBarangay officials and tanods from Pis-anan and Catmon, with nine Government Internship Program interns;\nTwo investigators from the provincial government. A triage area was set up at RMSDH and ASMGH, while a temporary staging and triage area was established at the Barangay Pis-anan Covered Court. An Incident Command Post was also activated near the school to streamline operations and agency coordination.\nThe responding units conducted on-site assessments, delivered first aid, transported students to medical facilities, and managed the crowd to ensure the safety of the remaining school community.\nAs a result of this incident, both RMSDH and ASMGH reached full capacity, prompting a regional call for folding beds and additional healthcare workers.\nWhile the origin of the foul smell remains unknown, the community’s collective effort — from government leaders to medical professionals to ordinary citizens — helped mitigate the immediate impact of this emergency.\nHealth officials confirmed that all patients received immediate medical attention either on-site or at hospitals.\nAn inter-agency investigation is ongoing to determine the origin and exact nature of the chemical odor. Officials continue to urge residents to avoid the area while assessments are conducted.\nAs of July 3, hospitals in Antique remain on high alert. Public health teams and emergency responders are monitoring affected individuals, while local leaders and volunteers work round-the-clock to support recovery efforts.\nDepEd Antique has suspended Pis-anan National High School and Pis-anan Elementary School until safety is ensured, following a health and environmental incident that led to temporary class suspensions pending full clearance from authorities..
