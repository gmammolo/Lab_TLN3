Pixabay LicenseImage by Joachim Schnürle from Pixabay Forecasts indicate the situation will worsen, according to the study from Poland’s Centre of Postgraduate Medical Education (CMKP). By 2035, over 35 percent of Polish men and more than a quarter of women are expected to suffer from obesity, a condition with major health, social and economic implications. The findings, presented in The Social Image of Obesity report, were unveiled by Prof. Mateusz Jankowski, head of the Department of Population Health at CMKP's School of Public Health. He warned of a dangerous trend: since 1990, the proportion of adults with obesity in Poland has doubled, while the number of obese teenagers has quadrupled. Yet public awareness is high: 85 percent of Poles consider obesity a disease, and 86 percent believe it is a major health issue. Women were more likely than men to recognise obesity as both a medical and social problem. Reducing obesity rates could lead to significant health gains, including lower death rates from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and better overall quality of life. The report urges policymakers to make obesity prevention a national public health priority. The survey, conducted in May on a representative sample of 1,088 adults, found that most respondents correctly identified poor diet and lack of exercise as key contributors. But over two-thirds also pointed to hormonal and genetic factors. Awareness of obesity-related complications is generally strong as most people linked obesity to type 2 diabetes (81 percent), hypertension (79 percent), heart failure (74 percent), and joint degeneration (65 percent). However, fewer were aware of links to sleep apnea, endocrine disorders or reproductive issues such as polycystic ovary syndrome. When asked about treatment options, most respondents mentioned lifestyle changes, such as improving diet and increasing physical activity, but knowledge of other interventions was limited: only half were aware of bariatric surgery (weight loss operations such as gastric bypass and gastric sleeve), and just a third knew about the availability of weight-loss medication. Co-author Dr. Justyna Grudziąż-Sękowska noted that Polish attitudes toward obesity remain divided. While 46 percent of respondents said they support accepting overweight and obese bodies as part of physical diversity, 34 percent were opposed. Younger adults (aged 18–29) were least accepting of people with obesity. More than 40 percent of adults surveyed associated obesity with shame or a lack of self-care, with these views more common among men than women. The authors of the report called for systemic changes to ensure coordinated care for people living with obesity. This should include psychological support, dietary counselling, promotion of physical activity, and access to medical treatments, including surgery and pharmacotherapy where appropriate. They also emphasise the need for public education campaigns about the causes and consequences of obesity, particularly the impact of lifestyle and the potential for change. Grudziąż-Sękowska said that legislative reforms may also be necessary, in particular those that support healthier dietary choices and increased physical activity. She cited a need to reduce consumption of ultra-processed foods, sugary drinks and saturated fats, especially among children and teens. (rt/gs) Source: PAP",
