  "text": "Extreme heat leading to higher sick leave rates in Germany\nprivacy policy\nHeatwaves mean Germany’s employees are taking more sick days, according to new figures from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs.\nWorkers in Germany are taking more sick leave due to health problems caused or exacerbated by the extremely hot weather.\nAccording to figures from the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, reported by the dpa, health issues linked to extreme heat were behind 92.700 sick days taken in 2023, a 12 percent increase on the previous record year in 2018.\nThe figures have been increasing since 2015, but have varied in the years since. In 2021, just 32.400 sick days were taken due to extreme heat-related health problems. In 2022, it rose to 71.200 days.\nThe health problems behind the figures include heatstroke, sunstroke, heat exhaustion and similar diagnoses. In 2023, men were likely to be off sick from work due to heat-related health problems; 63.145 such sick days were taken by men compared to the 29.577 days taken by women. This is likely because more men work in manual labour jobs outside.\nThe figures were published by the Federal Ministry of Social Affairs in response to a request from The Left Party. In light of their publication, the Greens are calling on the government to implement better heat protection measures for workers.\n“We want to ensure that employers take measures that serve their employees' health when workplace temperatures reach or exceed 26 degrees celsius,” a Greens draft resolution seen by public broadcaster Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) reads.\nIn early June, Left Party co-leader Jan van Aken suggested that employers cut working hours when indoor temperatures exceed 26 degrees. Van Aken said that working hours should be halved when temperatures exceed 30 degrees and that work should stop if temperatures exceed 35 degrees.\nVladeep / Shutterstock.com",
