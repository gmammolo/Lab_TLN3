  "text": "A Tennessee court has sided with the family of a Tennessee man who was treated with a potent mix of hydrogen peroxide for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, awarding his heirs $1.3 million in damages.\nIn a May 19 decision, Tennessee Circuit Court Judge Michael Pemberton sided with the heirs of 80-year-old Stefan Suto, who died after receiving an experimental hydrogen peroxide treatment for COVID-19 by Dr. Carrie Madej. Pemberton awarded Suto's estate, with his daughter Jana Sutoova Bennun as executrix, $1 million in punitive damages and $181,000 in compensatory damages.\nHe also ordered that Jana, in her capacity as an individual plaintiff, be paid $100,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. All in all, Madej was ordered to pay $1.33 million in damages, alongside all court costs taxed against her.\nJana and her husband Steve Bennun, Suto's son-in-law, believed they were acting in his best interest under Madej's guidance. However, Suto died from hemolytic anemia caused by toxic peroxide exposure. According to court documents, Madej administered nebulized and intravenous hydrogen peroxide, before the 80-year-old's condition rapidly declined.\nDespite pleas for further medical intervention, Madej allegedly refused, prompting the family to seek alternative care in Florida. But this was too late – Suto passed away on Dec. 23, 2021.\nThe lawsuit by Suto's heirs alleged negligence and wrongful death. Madej – who surrendered her Georgia medical license in 2023 – never responded to the claims.\nSuto's ordeal began when he and his family developed flu-like symptoms that they suspected were COVID-19. They turned to Madej, also an advocate of health freedom, for help. The family knew Madej from their forays into the health freedom movement, as they even hosted content about it on their YouTube channel.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, hydrogen peroxide was used as a therapy by alternative healthcare providers. But the case involving Suto's death at the hands of Madej underscores the dangers of such therapies if not done properly. His family members allege the treatments \"[caused agonizing pain and [the] decline of Stefan's health condition](https://www.justiceforstefansuto.org/) to a point of no return.\"\nDespite the civil judgment favoring his heirs, Suto's family said the victory provides little solace. \"They turned their backs on us,\" Steven lamented.\nOutrageDepot.com has more similar stories.\nWatch this video about the use of nebulized hydrogen peroxide, the improper use of which unfortunately caused the death of Stefan Suto.\nThis video is from the EnergyMe333 channel on Brighteon.com.",
