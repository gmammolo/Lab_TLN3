  "text": "A drug-resistant strain of Salmonella has been linked to widely distributed deli meats in Alberta, Ontario and Manitoba, triggering a nationwide recall and urgent warnings from officials.\nAccording to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the outbreak has been traced to specific lots of Rea Genoa Salami and Bona Mild Genova Salami. Most of the cases were reported in Alberta (44 cases) and Ontario (13 cases), with seven hospitalizations and concern that more cases are still to come.\nOn June 10, CFIA issued a voluntary recall for the products – reportedly sold across butcher counters, cafés, delis and grocery stores. Affected lot codes and UPCs include 2035 226, 5049 226 and 2050 228. But here's the catch: Some of the meat was sliced and sold without labels, making it difficult for consumers to identify whether they've been exposed or contaminated.\nAnybody who has eaten salami between April and late May and experienced symptoms like cramps, diarrhea, fever and chills, headache or nausea should contact their healthcare provider immediately. The PHAC warns that symptoms can appear as late as 45 days after exposure.\nThe strain of Salmonella enterica linked to the outbreak is particularly worrisome because it resists multiple antibiotics – including ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. That makes treatment more difficult and raises the stakes for prevention.\nSalmonella is a group of bacteria that live in the intestines of animals and humans. It is one of the most common causes of foodborne illnesses or food poisoning. This pathogen spreads through contaminated eggs, fruits, meat, poultry, vegetables and even processed foods.\nSymptoms typically begin six to 72 hours after infection. These can include abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting. While most people recover without antibiotics, serious cases can lead to dehydration, hospitalization and death in rare cases.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that for every lab-confirmed Salmonella case, 30 others go unreported in the United States. It causes more than one million illnesses each year.\nSome people are more vulnerable to serious food illnesses each year, including:\nThese groups are not only more likely to become seriously ill, but they're also more at risk from antibiotic-resistant strains. This growing threat has been driven by the overuse of antibiotics in both humans and livestock.\nResearch from the University of Connecticut (UConn) shows that even cooked or processed meats like cold cuts, deli meats and hotdogs are vulnerable to contamination – especially if not stored or handled correctly after cooking. Bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus can grow in cooked meats if they're left out too long, stored improperly or cross-contaminated during slicing and serving.\nAnd then there's the issue of mechanical tenderization, where needles pierce meat to soft it. This process can push surface bacteria deep into the center of the meat, where it might survive unless cooked thoroughly. Food safety experts recommend four simple but powerful steps to reduce your risk:\nThis outbreak is not just a headline. It is a real-world reminder of the hidden risks we face every day at the table. As regulators race to remove contaminated products from shelves, the most powerful protection still lies with individual consumers.\nCleanFoodWatch.com has more similar stories.\nWatch this video about food safety from the SafeConsume food safety initiative in Europe.",
