  "text": "Zynex ( ZYXI ) received an update from Tricare that the temporary payment suspension will continue. “As we previously announced, we were notified of a temporary suspension of payments from our largest insurance customer, Tricare,” said CEO Thomas Sandgaard. “We appealed the temporary suspension and met with Tricare officials in April where we presented our data and evidence as to why the payment suspension should be lifted. We received a response from Tricare, and they have decided to continue the temporary suspension while they conduct further review. As such, the temporary payment suspension will continue until Tricare makes its final decision.”\nDon’t Miss TipRanks’ Half-Year Sale Take advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off!
