  "text": "Papillion restaurant suffers under the heat of a broken AC\nOMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - A popular Papillion restaurant is losing business because of the heat and humidity over the past month.\nOne wonders why since it doesn’t have outside seating.\nFovero Greek Restaurant remains open because it has a lot of fans, which help customers endure the inside temperature.\n“It’s going up. I can feel it. So it will be very steamy. That’s why we came early,” said customer Deb Wieczorek.\nSince renting the restaurant space two years ago, Lori Long said she’s been experiencing the hottes summer yet, but not in the cash register.\n“Last week, closing three days early and losing thousands of dollars in sales - customers leaving because it’s too hot to eat in here,” Long said.\nInstead of a fork, customer Judy O’Conner picks up a thermometer.\n“I see 85 degrees right now,” she said.\nThe staff keeps the food hot while trying to cool the restaurant.\nFor the noon lunch crowd, the thermostat stays cool on 71 degrees. But the actual temperature in the business reads 84 degrees and will climb.\nThe temperature reached 93 degrees Tuesday evening, which forced the manager to make the last open hour take-out only.\n“I need the air conditioning and whether it’s what the management company says, the hood, or whatever, reconditioned air, I need something that will cool the space for everyone,” Long said.\nLong said the landlord brought in HVAC experts who estimated repairs at $36,000 but she can’t afford to pay any of that cost.\nJennifer Thompson set up a GoFundMe site for the restaurant’s daily operating expenses and to raise awareness of the air conditioning issue.\n“The hope would be that the landlord takes responsibility if it their responsibility, and also to help with some emergency relief keeping staff paid and doors open,” Thompson said.\nThe 16 mostly part-time restaurant workers aren’t leaving, except for a break.\n“It’s been where I have to go home and sleep for a while to work off the heat in front of a fan and take cold showers,” said server Shannon Sharman.\n“This is (Long’s) dream, so I want to see it succeed,” O’Conner said.\nLong said owning a restaurant is in her blood, but customers’ sweat has brought her to tears.\n“If this continues, I can’t financially succeed,” Long said.\nWednesday night, Long had to close early again as the indoor temperature reached 97 degrees before 5 p.m.\nThe lack of adequate cooling in the restaurant ahs forced Long to close early a total of more than 20 hours over six days in June. She estimated that cost her at least $5,000 in revenue.\nFirst Alert 6 left a message for the building’s owner in North Dakota but has yet to receive a response from them or the strip mall manager.\nCopyright 2025 WOWT.
