  "text": "“There must be a complete ban on betel nuts within the vicinity of Mt Hagen City because it is tainting a bad picture to the general public.”\nWilson Moke, a local from Mt Hagen, said this as the city of Mt Hagen is riddled with betelnut stains, tarnishing the image of the city.\nMr Moke said chewing and spitting of betelnut stains everywhere in the town looks unhygienic because it was spoiling the image of the town.\nHe supported the call made by Western Highlands Provincial Member Wai Rapa recently encouraging the people to do away with betelnut trading and do something else because it was not supporting the Small Medium Entrepreneurs (SME).\nMr Moke said the call by the Western Highlands Provincial Member Wai Rapa was a welcoming one because betelnut was not grown in the Highlands, thus it created a lot of stains and mouth cancer, but the Highlands people trade betelnut as one of their daily business activities.\nRead more in your nambawan daily Post Courier tomorrow – Thursday, July 03, 2025.",
