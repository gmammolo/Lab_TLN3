Check out our review of the first three episodes of Netflix's Berlin. Sonal Pandya Updated Dec 29, 2023 | 06:54 PM IST Berlin Review: Money Heist Spinoff Brings Thrills In Engaging Flashback Tale In the ever-expanding realm of heist dramas on Netflix, the streaming giant has unveiled its latest addition to the genre, Berlin. Following in the footsteps of successful predecessors such as Money Heist and Lupin, this series promises an exhilarating ride for fans of high-stakes capers. Berlin: NarrativeSet in the same universe as Money Heist, Berlin serves as a prequel, focusing on the character Berlin and delving into his dual interests in romance and robbery. The narrative unfolds in the city of love, Paris, where Berlin leads a daring heist to snatch $44 million worth of jewels from an auction house. Guiding a diverse team through an intricately planned operation, viewers are left wondering whether Berlin and his crew will emerge triumphant in the eight-episode series. Related News Berlin: Writing and DirectionHailing from the creative minds of Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato, the duo behind Money Heist and Sky Rojo, Berlin introduces the familiar elements of a classic heist—surveillance, deception, and a diverse crew featuring archetypal roles like the tech genius, the upstart, and the wildcard. Notably, Berlin assumes the role of the mastermind, a position previously held by his brother, the Professor, in the original series. Pina and Lobato skillfully infuse the narrative with Berlin's conflicting characteristics, portraying him as both a fun-loving individual and a ruthless strategist. The storyline cleverly explores Berlin's tendencies, especially his knack for falling for the wrong woman concerning the task at hand. Berlin: PerformancesThe Spanish series boasts a stellar cast, with Pedro Alonso reprising his role as Berlin, supported by talented actors like Tristán Ulloa, Michelle Jenner, and others. Despite the show's titular focus, all characters receive significant development, offering a comprehensive view of their roles within the intricate plot. Berlin provides a nostalgic journey into a happier period of the protagonist's life, capturing his enthusiasm for chaos and adrenaline. Alonso's portrayal masterfully navigates Berlin's complex persona, bringing authenticity to the character's evolution. Berlin: CritiqueWith its breezy yet suspenseful tone, Berlin delivers an all-or-nothing vibe, making it ideal for an end-of-the-year streaming binge. While injecting humor and flirtations to distract viewers, the series truly shines when executing jaw-dropping heist sequences, capturing the essence of the genre. While Berlin may not achieve the iconic status of its predecessor, Money Heist, it undeniably succeeds in providing an entertaining crime drama. As it expands the Money Heist franchise, the prequel introduces new characters and weaves an engaging narrative, ensuring that fans remain captivated by the thrilling world of heists and character backstories.
