  "text": "I received news a few days ago that former LG Twins manager Lee Kwang-hwan's health was critical, and on the morning of the 2nd, I heard the sad news that he passed away.The deceased was a talent in Korean baseball and a top scholar, and was a junior who played on the field alongside his contemporaries, with whom he had a deep connection. Although there was not much personal interaction, I was close to Manager Kang Byung-cheol and was able to get closer to him through Kang.In my opinion, the deceased was an incredibly ambitious friend with big dreams. Hailing from Daegu, he transferred to Seoul Central High School in the first year of high school in 1964. The following year, he won his first championship at the prestigious Golden Lion High School tournament hosted by the Dong-A Ilbo.The 'Korean Baseball Encyclopedia,' compiled with great dedication by veteran baseball journalist Hong Soon-il, includes over 8,000 baseball figures, journalists, players, and others. The encyclopedia fully introduces the deceased's illustrious career in baseball.During his time as a player at Seoul Central High School, he proved to be the top star of high school baseball by winning the Lee Young-min batting award, and after his retirement from Korea University and the Hanil Bank baseball club, he began his coaching career as the head coach of his alma mater, Seoul Central High School.When professional baseball launched in 1982, the deceased joined the OB Bears as a coach and assisted Manager Kim Young-duk in leading the team to become the first champions of the Korea Professional Baseball League.After successfully transforming into a professional baseball manager, he was appointed as a manager following his role as coach, succeeding Kim Young-duk and Kim Sung-keun, and served as the manager of LG, Doosan, Hanwha, and Heroes, establishing himself as a distinguished manager.At times, he faced humiliation by resigning prematurely due to conflicts with the coaching staff and poor performance, but in 1994, he won the Korean Series with the LG Twins while bringing forth 'exciting baseball' and received the Manager of the Year award (Sports Seoul), continuing his remarkable journey.The reason I hold the deceased in high regard and refer to him as an ambitious leader is that he was the most diligent scholar among baseball coaches.Typically, when a current coach's season ends or their contract is terminated mid-season, it is common to stay in the country and seek the next position, but he traveled abroad each time to learn advanced baseball. His training included studies with major league clubs in Japan and the United States.He deeply analyzed the weak points and issues of new Korean professional baseball in comparison with Japan's top team, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Major League Baseball clubs, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals.In particular, he meticulously clarified the division of duties for pitchers during mound operations, adopting what is known as a star system to thoroughly protect pitchers and heighten the focus in games, laying a substantial foundation for enhancing the team's overall performance.The late Sports Seoul reporter Lee Jong-nam took the lead in spreading the deceased's baseball philosophy through a special human relationship, which is referred to as autonomous baseball. At that time, it was not easy for players, who were accustomed to passive training based on the coach's unilateral directives, to shift to a self-researching approach.In fact, objectively, many baseball professionals said that the original of autonomous baseball was Kim Eung-ryong, coach of the Haitai Tigers. Coach Kim also learned from American baseball before the launch of professional baseball and conveyed to the domestic scene the preparations that the coaching staff should first make to ensure players could practice without discomfort. The usually taciturn Coach Kim rigorously encouraged players to take initiative.Regardless, the deceased was exposed to diverse domestic and international baseball and was frequently interested in the external development of baseball, taking action above all. In 1995, he opened Korea's first baseball museum in Seogwipo, Jeju, which had no particular affiliation and was merely a baseball wasteland at the time, using his own funds. This was an initiative realized based on insights gained during his training in Major League Baseball.He also showed interest in women's baseball, partnering with Jeong Jin-goo, president of the Korean Women's Baseball Association, to significantly enhance its level. His volunteer work for over ten years without compensation to help the baseball team at Seoul National University is also memorable.Even after stepping down as a professional baseball coach, his passion did not wane. He continuously worked at the forefront of baseball development by acting as the chairperson of the KBO Youth Development Committee and supplying T-ball to primary and secondary school educators to expand the base for youth baseball.Above all, I will never forget his deep involvement in the establishment of the 'Baseball Academy' created by the Korea Baseball Organization (Korea Baseball Organization (KBO)), the Korea Baseball Association (Kang Seung-kyu, president), and Seoul National University (Lee Jang-woo, president) for the development of baseball and the sports industry through industry-academic cooperation and joint research.In the realm of protecting baseball development and players' rights, I, who played a role in launching the Ilgu Meeting comprised of 27 baseball veterans, mid-level journalists, current coaches, and commentators, recall fondly that the deceased wished to work as the secretary when I was elected as the 8th and 9th president, creating a team to exchange diverse opinions. As a cheerful man and a good friend with senior and junior relationships, I believe that the Ilgu Meeting laid a strong foundation for its development to this day.The deceased, who was active in various fields such as broadcasting commentary and writing newspaper columns, had a keen insight, particularly after studying with the St. Louis Cardinals, in implementing the star system that precisely subdivided pitchers' roles, which accounted for over 70% of game outcomes. He effectively broke down the roles of pitchers that had been previously classified as starters and finishers, which greatly assisted in protecting pitchers, and that is why I evaluate him as the most significant contributor to the advancement of professional baseball.While it is said that he had a strong will and was stubborn, he did have disputes with those around him due to continuous debates on baseball issues. However, it is undeniable that he instilled a culture among not only managers but also players that they needed to study. His achievement in changing the team colors of the LG Twins and leading them to become the champions of the Korean Series in 1994 was also based on such foundations.I hope he meets his beloved baseball evangelist Lee Jong-nam and reporter Cheon Il-pyeong in heaven and enjoys watching Korean baseball with peace of mind. I pray for the deceased's soul.July 3, 2025. Kim So-sik (former president of the Ilgu Meeting)[OSEN]",
