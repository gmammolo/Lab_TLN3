  "text": "Brijesh Solanki, a 22-year-old state-level kabaddi player from Farana village, Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, died of rabies on 28 June 2025, weeks after being bitten by a puppy he rescued from a drain. Despite the bite, Brijesh did not receive an anti-rabies vaccine, mistaking the injury for a minor scratch.\nHis condition deteriorated rapidly, and he was denied treatment at several government hospitals before succumbing to the disease. Health officials have since launched a rabies awareness campaign in his village, while his family and the local community mourn his loss and demand accountability. The incident has sparked widespread discussion on the urgent need for public health awareness and systemic reforms.\nA Rising Star Lost to Negligence\nBrijesh was a gold medallist in state kabaddi championships and was preparing for the Pro Kabaddi League. Known for his compassion, he rescued a stray puppy in March, only to be bitten in the process. “He went to practice in the village and got a little bite from a dog after pulling it out of a drain. He did not pay attention to it,” said his brother, Sandeep Kumar.\nBrijesh’s coach, Praveen Kumar, added, “Brijesh mistook the pain in his arm for a regular kabaddi injury. The bite seemed minor and he didn’t think it was serious, so he didn’t take the vaccine.” Videos of Brijesh’s final days, showing him in severe pain and suffering classic rabies symptoms like hydrophobia, have circulated widely, highlighting the tragedy of his preventable death.\nSystemic Gaps and Community Response\nAfter Brijesh began showing symptoms such as numbness and fear of water, his family sought help at multiple hospitals in Khurja, Aligarh, and Delhi, but were reportedly denied admission. Only in Noida was rabies suspected, but by then, it was too late.\nSandeep Kumar, Brijesh’s brother, explained that Brijesh suddenly developed a fear of water and began showing symptoms consistent with rabies. The family sought help at government hospitals in Khurja, Aligarh, and even Delhi, but they were allegedly denied treatment at each facility. It was only after reaching a hospital in Noida that doctors identified rabies as the likely cause of Brijesh’s condition. Sadly, Brijesh passed away while the family was transporting him to a faith healer in Mathura\nBrijesh died while being taken to a faith healer in Mathura. The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Sunil Kumar Dohre, urged, “People should get themselves examined at a government hospital in case of any dog, monkey or other animal bite.” In response, health officials vaccinated 29 villagers and initiated a rabies awareness drive. The entire village gathered to bid farewell to Brijesh, whose death has left the sports community in shock and grief.\nThe Logical Indian’s Perspective\nBrijesh Solanki’s story is a stark reminder of the urgent need for public health awareness, timely medical intervention, and empathy in our communities.\nHis selfless act of kindness should have been met with support, not tragedy. We must foster a culture where no one dismisses animal bites as trivial, and where healthcare systems respond swiftly and compassionately.",
