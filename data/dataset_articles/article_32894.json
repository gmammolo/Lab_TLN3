  "text": "The GCAptAIN study did not meet its primary endpoint of sustained remission at Week 52 in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA1\nSafety in GCA patients was consistent with known safety profile of Cosentyx® (secukinumab)1\nBasel, July 03, 2025 - Novartis today announced top-line results from the Phase III GCAptAIN study evaluating Cosentyx® (secukinumab) in adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing giant cell arteritis (GCA).\nIn the study, Cosentyx was evaluated in combination with a 26-week steroid taper and compared to placebo plus a 52-week steroid taper. Cosentyx did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in sustained remission at Week 52 compared to placebo. While the secondary outcomes did not show statistical superiority, Cosentyx showed numerically better outcomes compared to placebo for cumulative steroid dose and steroid-related toxicity1. Safety in GCA was consistent with the known safety profile of Cosentyx1, which is supported by robust evidence and 10 years of real-world data across its approved indications2-7.",
