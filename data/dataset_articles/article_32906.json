  "text": "3 Min Read\nBiocon Chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw countered Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and stated that COVID-19 vaccines developed in India were approved under the Emergency Use Authorisation framework.\nThe remarks came after Siddaramaiah linked heart-related deaths in Hassan district of Karnataka to Covid vaccine. He had said \"hasty approval and distribution\" of the Covid vaccine to the public could also be a reason for these deaths.\n\"COVID-19 vaccines developed in India were approved under the Emergency Use Authorisation framework, following rigorous protocols aligned with global standards for safety and efficacy. To suggest that these vaccines were ‘hastily’ approved is factually incorrect and contributes to public misinformation. These vaccines have saved millions of lives and, like all vaccines, may cause side effects in a very small number of individuals. It is important to acknowledge the science and data-driven processes behind their development, rather than engage in retrospective blame,\" Shaw said in a post on X.\nUnion Health Ministry statement\nOn July 2, the Union Health Ministry said extensive studies by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and AIIMS have conclusively established\nSudden cardiac deaths can result from a wide range of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and post-Covid complications, the ministry said in a statement.\nSiddaramaiah remarks\nThe Karnataka chief minister had said more than 20 people have died due to heart attacks in the past month alone in just one district of Hassan.\n\"The government is taking this matter very seriously. To identify the exact cause of these series of deaths and to find solutions, a committee of experts has been formed under the leadership of Dr Ravindranath, Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, and they have been instructed to submit a study report within 10 days,\" he said in a post on X.\nThe remarks came after Siddaramaiah linked heart-related deaths in Hassan district of Karnataka to Covid vaccine.
