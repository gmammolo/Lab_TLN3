  "text": "foto: é•¿æ˜¥è¥¿é—¨å¤§å®˜äºº/Weibo\nBrilio.net - Wearing makeup every day has become a routine for many people, but what if for more than two decades, someone has never really cleaned it off? That's what happened to a woman from Jilin, China, who recently went viral after revealing her extreme habits.\nHis face is now severely inflamed, thickened like a monkey. Even his facial skin has changed color to bright red like a lobster.\nThe 37-year-old woman admitted that she had never completely removed her makeup for the past 22 years. As a result, her facial skin condition is now very concerning and is said to resemble the god Guan Gong who is known in Chinese culture because of his bright red face.\nThe news surfaced through a video showing the woman's face swollen, red, and looking like an overripe tomato. In the video, she was also seen having difficulty opening her eyes because of the thick red rash covering her face.\nIn a video widely circulated on Weibo, the woman named Gao described how terrible the itching she constantly felt. She even felt unable to live her social life as before.\nphoto: /Weibo\n\"The itching was unbearable. I locked myself in the house every day. I didn't dare go out,\" Gao said while holding back tears, quoted from 8days.sg, Wednesday (2/7).\nShe described how her face felt burning, stiff, and itchy to the point of interfering with her daily activities. The drastic changes to her face also made her feel less confident.\n\"My whole face is now full of wrinkles and ugly. I don't dare to go out of the house, meet people, or make friends,\" she said again.\nGao said her love for makeup began at the age of 15, when she secretly tried on her mother's lipstick. Since then, she has found removing makeup a hassle.\nShe started to get used to not cleaning her face because she thought she would wear makeup again the next day. This habit lasted for decades without realizing the long-term impact.\n\"Why should I clean it if I'm going to wear it again tomorrow?\" he said innocently.\nFor 22 years, Gao had been washing her face with only water, without soap or any other facial cleanser. Although she had occasional acne, she didnt think it was a big dealuntil one day her face became so swollen that it was unrecognizable.\nphoto: /Weibo\nWhen the condition worsened, instead of going to a dermatologist, she sought a solution at a beauty clinic. She decided to undergo a skin booster injection procedure which actually made the condition worse.\nInstead of getting better, her skin became dull, stiff, and even turned purple-black. This made her appearance even more deviant from normal conditions.\nSome dermatologists have responded skeptically to the case, doubting that the main cause of Gao's facial disfigurement was simply failure to remove makeup.\nSome suspect her condition was exacerbated by botched cosmetic procedures, use of steroid-containing facial creams, or over-cleansing. Her symptoms are said to be similar to rosacea or steroid-induced dermatitis.\n(brl/ola)",
