  "text": "The incident occurred at 01.30 am on the Akkikavu bypass, bus driver critically injured\nThrissur: Fourteen people were injured when a KSRTC bus and a lorry carrying fish collided in Pannithadam junction on the Akkikavu bypass in Thrissur on Thursday morning. The bus driver’s injuries are critical, according to media reports.\nThe accident occurred in the wee hours of the day, at 01.30 am. The KSRTC bus was travelling from Calicut to Kumily, Idukki, when the collision occurred. The lorry had loaded fish from Kunnamkulam and was headed to Alathur.\nFollowing the accident, the two vehicles rammed into a nearby shop. The front side of both vehicles were completely destroyed in the process. The injured have been admitted to a private hospital in Kunnamkulam.\nAccidents have become a regular occurrence after the bypass was renovated. A similar incident took place recently when a fish lorry collided with another lorry. Temporary arrangements have been erected on the bypass to enable motorists to control speed while driving and prevent accidents. However, lack of such safety measures on the Wadakkanchery-Chavakkad State Highway poses problems at present.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.
