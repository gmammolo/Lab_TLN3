  "text": "At least 120 cats of various breeds and ages were seized from a home in a quiet Fullerton neighborhood on Wednesday, July 2, much to the surprise of some nearby residents.\nOrange County Animal Control spokesperson Jackie Pratt said a community member had called the agency and reported seeing “a large number of cats at the residence and were concerned about their welfare.”\nAnimal control officers were dispatched around noon to the 2600 block of Balfour Avenue, near Chapman Avenue and west of the 57 Freeway, along with several Fullerton Police officers. The cats, which ranged from kittens to older adult cats, were found in and around the home.\nThe total amount of cats seized has not been determined yet, as animals were still being processed for intake at the agency’s headquarters in Tustin. Pratt said a lot of the cats suffered from some form of contagious illness and would receive proper treatment and care with the agency. She added that it didn’t appear that the cats were mistreated, there were just unfortunately too many.\nNeighbors described the whole ordeal as odd, and many said the large police presence was unexpected for their area. One 68-year-old woman, who asked not to be named, said animal control officers had come around a week prior asking about cats in the neighborhood.\nNo arrests were made. Residents living inside the home where the animals were seized declined to comment.\nPratt said the case is being investigated as a criminal matter and if charges were filed, it would likely be for a misdemeanor animal cruelty charge, citing a failure to properly care for the animals. The animals will eventually be available for adoption after they receive medical treatment and the investigation is complete.\n“We have tons of cats at the shelter, so if they want to foster or adopt any of our current residents, it’ll help us make room for these rescues,” she added.\nThe shelter is located at 1630 Victory Rd. Tustin, CA 92782.\nRelated Articles\nSilverwood Lake Recreation Area closed through July 4th holiday weekend Couple whose failure to care for their son led to permanent brain damage convicted in OC of child abuse YouTuber gets 6 months for street racing in Orange County, but can wear monitor instead of jail CHP officer suffers apparent medical emergency, crashes into tree in Culver City and dies Charter Communications calls Van Nuys attack ‘domestic terrorism,’ LAPD calls it vandalism Read More Details\nFinally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( OC Animal Control seizes at least 120 cats from Fullerton home )\nAlso on site :",
