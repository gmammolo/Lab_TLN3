  "text": "A severed fibreoptic cable is behind a mobile phone and internet outage across large parts of Golden Bay, in Tasman, which has also affected 111 calls since early this morning.\nIt comes as the Tasman region extended a state of emergency for another week after it was besieged by rain and floods at the weekend and was on Thursday expecting more heavy rain.\nChorus technicians found a fault on a fibre line running over Takaka Hill caused by a slip, that resulted in an estimated 1150 households in Golden Bay losing internet and mobile coverage for most of Thursday.\nTechnicians found a severed cable at Uruwhenua Bridge on State Highway 60 and were currently working to repair it and restore services, including emergency calls to the 111 system.\nChorus said the fault impacted 350 copper connections and 800 fibre connections.\nIt brought in technicians from other areas to help find the fault as quickly as possible in difficult weather conditions.\n\"Our field teams have quickly mobilised to the fault site and are working to identify the cause of the outage,\" it said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"Priority will be given to faults that affect multiple customers or involve medical or emergency needs.\n\"Additionally, because Chorus' fibre network supports many of New Zealand's mobile towers, restoring mobile coverage is also a focus.\"\nChorus apologised to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by the outage and said it appreciated everyone's patience while it worked to restore connections as quickly and safely as possible.\n\"While we are focused on restoring affected connections quickly, our priority is the health and safety of our staff, contractors and the public.\"\nNelson Tasman Emergency Management said earlier on Thursday it was aware of the fault on the Chorus communications network and advised anyone with an emergency to still try ringing 111.\n\"Currently, the 111 network is intermittent as the issue is being worked on, and we hope it will be resolved soon but, in the meantime, if you have an emergency please keep trying.\n\"People should still try to call 111 if their mobile network is down.\"\nThe Telecommunications Forum chief executive Paul Brislen said people with no cell phone coverage in Tasman should still try to call 111 if they needed to in an emergency, because another mobile network provider might carry the call.\n\"There's no damage to any of cell phone towers or to the power supply so once that fibre fix is completed that should reconnect all of those phones and all of those cell phone towers,\" he said.\nCivil Defence said Golden Bay residents should ask a neighbour for help in an emergency if they can't get through to 111.\nCivil Defence controller Alec Louverdis said with the fault now being worked on it was expected a temporary fix should be in place before the end of the day.\nHe said there were few alternatives to calling 111 for people who needed emergency services.\nTo make temporary repairs contractors would have to use an excavator which meant there might be some interruptions to traffic, however traffic management will be in place.\n\"In the meantime, if you do have an emergency situation and can do so safely, make your way to the Takaka Fire Station which is staffed and has resources and communications.\"\nThe Tasman District Council said on Facebook it was aware of the fault and reassured residents the situation was being resolved as quickly as possible.\nMeanwhile Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell said he had asked his officials to work closely with Chorus to restore the services for Golden Bay.\nHe said a lot of planning had been done in preparation for the weather and he expected to be heading back to Tasman tomorrow, \"depending on what unfolds in the next few hours\".\n\"The constant message is: please don't go into flood waters because they are dangerous,\" Mitchell said.\n\"Update yourself regularly on information, and please follow any instructions, especially from our first responders, or even if there are contractors and road workers out there and they block a road. They're doing it for a reason.\"\nMitchell said the government's focus was on the immediate response but was also assessing what additional support would be required.\nSign up for Ngā Pitopito Kōrero, a daily newsletter curated by our editors and delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
