  "text": "(Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images)\nOver the past two seasons since the Cleveland Browns acquired star quarterback Deshaun Watson, the three-time Pro Bowler has played in only 12 games for the franchise, which is obviously not ideal with how much the team has invested in their new leader under center.\nLast season, the Browns were hoping to see their bold move to trade for and sign Watson pay off, as the team was very talented on both sides of the football and could’ve potentially been a legitimate title contender in the AFC.\nAlthough the Browns did much better than expected after Watson suffered a season-ending injury, Cleveland wants the quarterback position to be as secure as ever and is counting on the 28-year-old bouncing back next season for this franchise to live up to expectations.\nApparently, Watson is making great progress in his rehab from shoulder surgery and is confident that he’ll be good to go for Week 1 of the 2024 NFL regular season via Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com.\n“I’ve put my whole life into this. I wanna make sure I come back better than before,” Watson said.\n#Browns Deshaun Watson on why he’s confident he’ll be ready for Week 1 at the opening of his Lefty’s Cheesesteak in Univ Hts pic.twitter.com/XPXz24epNC\n— Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) April 4, 2024\nIf Watson can get back healthy and return to form as one of the best quarterbacks in the league, the Browns will be a force to be reckoned with in the AFC once again and quite possibly a team that can contend for a Super Bowl title during the 2024 campaign.\nOnly time will tell if the Watson experiment works out in Cleveland because so far, the team’s brass is probably regretting the move to bring him in, but there’s a chance to turn things around with a solid outing next season.",
