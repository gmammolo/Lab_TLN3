  "text": "By Stephanie Raymond ,\n3 hours ago\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of the first prescription digital treatment for depression.\nRejoyn is a smartphone app intended for use alongside antidepressant medications for people 22 and older who have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder.\nThe app employs a six-week \"brain-training program\" that is designed to help improve how the brain processes emotions. It combines emotional training exercises for the brain and brief therapeutic lessons, according to a news release from Otsuka Pharmaceutical and Click Therapeutics.\n\"The clearance of Rejoyn signals a fundamental change in how clinicians can treat symptoms of major depressive disorder,\" said David Benshoof Klein, co-founder and CEO at Click Therapeutics. \"It provides hope for those who are looking for new treatment options, especially one that is easily accessible through the device in the palm of your hand.\"\nExperts say traditional approaches are often effective, but many are left with only a partial response to treatment. Research has also found that up to 30% of people who take antidepressant medications are partial responders, meaning they continue to have depressive symptoms while using the drugs. The app was designed with these partial responders in mind.\nRejoyn acts \"like physical therapy for the brain,\" according to Brian Iacoviello, assistant professor of psychology at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine and scientific advisor at Click Therapeutics.\n\"[The app delivers] personalized, consistent brain-training exercises designed to help improve connections in the brain regions affected by depression,\" Iacoviello said in a statement. \"When stronger and more balanced connections are created, the regions of the brain responsible for processing and regulating emotions are better able to work together and symptoms of depression can improve.\"\nThe companies say clinical trial data shows individuals treated with Rejoyn experienced an improvement in depression symptom severity and showed continued improvement one month after completing the six-week treatment program -- all with no side effects.\nThe app is not intended to be used as a standalone therapy or a substitute for medication.\nRejoyn requires a prescription from a healthcare provider and is expected to be available for download in late 2024. It's not clear how much the six-week program will cost.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
