  "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. ( KKTV /Gray News) - A retired Marine and cancer survivor in Colorado celebrates the anniversary of his remission with a feat he picked up during his service.\nMichael LaBarge said he was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, grade IV brain cancer, 21 years ago on April 2.\nLaBarge said he has been in remission for a while and that he swims for 10 hours on the anniversary to celebrate it.\n“The prognosis was two weeks to 10 months … 21 years ago,” he told KKTV . “I did this a lot in the Marines. [Today,] I started at 6 a.m., stopping at 4 p.m.”\nHe completed his swim this year at the U.S. Air Force Academy’s Community Pool in Colorado Springs.\nChris Gesterling, the USAFA Pool Aquatics Manager, said he often sees LaBarge at the pool, and his story of surviving cancer is inspiring.\n“Former Marine ... you know, he beat brain cancer so everything is possible for him,” Gesterling said.\nAs LaBarge swam, he also shared his message for those fighting similar battles to the one he faced.\n“Hopefully, this will inspire people with cancer to get out, stay active and, you know, don’t get too down on themselves,” he said.\nCopyright 2024 KKTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.
