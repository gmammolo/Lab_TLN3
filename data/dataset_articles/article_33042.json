  "text": "Weekend Getaways\n9 Hotels for an Epic Weekend Getaway in EuropeBy Jessica Benavides Canepa\nFor many travelers, an ideal weekend getaway includes a mix of activities and relaxation. Some are drawn to cultural or adventure outings; for others, the perfect mini-break is lounging poolside with a good book. The key is selecting a hotel that caters to your particular needs while offering a variety of local experiences that enhance your stay.\nHere’s a selection of European hotels in the center of it all that will turn your weekend escape into a lifetime of memories. As always, check for travel guidelines and closures before planning your trip.\nThe Marmorosch Bucharest, Autograph Collection in Romania\nBucharest’s historic Old Town is filled with ancient treasures. Visitors can view artifacts at the National Museum of Romanian History; explore Curtea Veche, where Vlad the Impaler once ruled from; or behold the architectural beauty of Carturesti Carusel, a 19th-century bank-turned-bookshop. The Marmorosch Bucharest, Autograph Collection is a storied structure in its own right, with a history dating back to the Belle Epoque era. With ornate details like stained glass, wood paneling and marble tile, the property’s dazzling design preserves its heritage as a 1912 bank.\nThe vintage theme continues in the evening with period-inspired French cuisine at\nBlank restaurant and cocktails at The Vault, a speakeasy-style bar set in the building’s original vault.\nThe hotel is a quick stroll from Bucharest’s old-world attractions, and you can also coordinate visits to other notable sites like Transylvania’s\nBran Castle, the castle that inspired Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.”\nW Ibiza in Spain\nSanta Eulalia, a resort town with sleepier vibes than party-loving Ibiza Town, offers travelers a restful respite by the sea.\nAttractions of note include the 16th-century Puig de Missa church, a scenic promenade and a yacht-filled port.\nOn the south end of town,\nW Ibiza offers direct access to the Santa Eulalia promenade and is a short walk to the beach. Enjoy peace-inducing views of the Mediterranean Sea from the ground-floor Wet DECK pool area and the adults-only Glow – Rooftop with an infinity pool.\nThe guest rooms and suites have a relaxed, beachy vibe. Guests can continue the laid-back feel with in-suite AWAY Spa services, 24/7 FIT gym access, and alfresco meals and drinks while the sun sets.\nMoxy Athens City in Greece\nFor travelers who enjoy staying in charmingly quirky surrounds,\nMoxy Athens City provides urban artwork, clever signage, American-style eateries and sensational views of the Acropolis.\nAnd with proximity to\ncity attractions like neighboring old town Plaka, a villagelike district with cobbled streets lined with small shops and sidewalk cafés; local nightlife; and public transportation that takes visitors to major archeological sites, your weekend will surely be a well-rounded adventure.\nParagraph Freedom Square, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Tbilisi in Georgia\nFor a scenic outing through Tbilisi’s yesteryear, start your quest at\nParagraph Freedom Square, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Tbilisi, which fronts its namesake square, the oldest in Georgia. From here, you can stroll to the Georgian National Museum or the Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, in minutes.\nWhen you’ve had your fill of Tbilisi’s treasures, indulge in a massage or swim in the heated indoor pool at\nParagraph Spa, the hotel’s luxe, expansive, three-floor spa. At meal times, try the international menu at Ostigan, or stop for a bite and a spectacular skyline view of the city at Chinari Bar & Lounge.\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa in Malta\nIf a weekend of seaside cosmopolitan living is your dream, head to\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa. Located in St. Julian’s, just north of the capital city of Valletta, the hotel invites visitors to a leisurely escape surrounded by art nouveau architecture and overlooking the clear waters of tiny Balluta Bay.\nMalta Marriott Hotel & Spa has everything you need for a short holiday in the sun, from the hotel’s three pools (including an indoor spa option) to its\nfive on-site restaurants (four of which offer outdoor dining). Plus, you can easily reach Balluta Bay Beach via a promenade.\nWhen you’re ready to adventure further, explore St. Julian’s lively food and nightclub scene, venture to Valletta to dig into the area’s history and culture, or book a sailboat excursion around the Maltese Islands.\nSheraton Lisboa Hotel & Spa in Portugal\nLocated in the city center, the\nSheraton Lisboa Hotel & Spa provides an ideal base for discovering Lisbon’s best offerings. Tour the hilly streets of the Alfama district and listen to melancholic Fado music. Venture to Bairro Alto for gourmet eats and unusual wares. Or walk around the always-buzzy Praca do Comercio square.\nAfter a rejuvenating dip in the sparkling outdoor pool, relive the day’s journey from the\nhotel’s rooftop, which has panoramic views over the city and Tagus River.\nW Edinburgh in Scotland\nWith plenty of\nhistoric sites to visit, green spaces to explore, traditional food to try and much more, Edinburgh is a wonderful destination for a long weekend. The city is also very walkable — and from W Edinburgh, you can explore the UNESCO World Heritage Old and New Towns.\nIf shopping is among your favorite weekend activities, you’ll find items for all tastes at the centrally located\nSt. James Quarter, boasting 80 stores, a collection of international eateries, and fun activities like crazy golf and bowling. And a stay at W Edinburgh, situated inside the galleria, puts you at the center of it all.\nAfter a day of exploring and shopping, indulge in spa treatments at\nAWAY Spa and grab a bite to eat at in-house Sushisamba, a restaurant specializing in Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian flavors.\nDorothea Hotel, Budapest, Autograph Collection in Hungary\nIf spa lounging is more your speed, book a weekend at\nDorothea Hotel, Budapest, Autograph Collection, and kick back in the heated, 49-foot-long spa pool alongside a sleek, dark marble wall. The hotel also has a sizable gym, steam room, sauna and spa treatment spaces to level up your relaxation.\nBudapest is home to a host of soothing thermal baths, each offering a tranquil experience. For views over the Danube River, head to the\nLukacs Baths, a short drive from Dorothea Hotel. Some, including the oldest bath house in Europe, Szechenyi Baths, host nighttime “sparties” complete with music and drinks.\nOrtea Palace Hotel, Sicily, Autograph Collection in Italy\nHistory buffs will appreciate the thoughtful design behind\nOrtea Palace Hotel, Sicily, Autograph Collection in Italy. The former 1920s post office was reinvented as a hotel that honors the history of the building — and it’s a befitting base for exploring archeological sites in Syracuse, a city famed for its ancient relics.\nFrom the hotel, visit many fascinating finds, including the rock-embedded tombs at the Necropolis of Pantalica, the fifth-century B.C. Temple of Athena and the Neapolis Archeological Park, where travelers can behold the remnants of a Roman amphitheater.\nDuring your stay at Ortea Palace, Autograph Collection, be sure to savor Mediterranean dishes at\nIl Cortile, the hotel’s on-site restaurant, and reserve time at the Ortea Spa’s mosaic-tiled indoor pool to complete your weekend getaway.",
