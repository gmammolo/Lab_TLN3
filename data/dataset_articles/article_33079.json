  "text": "BENNINGTON — Bromley Mountain’s 21st annual “Mom’s Day Off” fundraiser set a new record on March 1, raising $12,000 to benefit breast cancer care at the Dartmouth Cancer Center at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center (SVMC).\nRecently retired Bromley General Manager Bill Cairns (center) and incoming GM Josh Witkin (left) presented a check to SVMC President and CEO Thomas A. Dee on Thursday, March 28 at the Peru, Vermont ski resort.\n“Mom’s Day Off is an event close to our hearts at Bromley Mountain,” said Cairns. “The community really shows up each year to make a difference. I’m thrilled that my final year at Bromley is breaking records and setting the bar a little higher for 2025!”\nBromley donated more than $7,600 in proceeds from lift ticket sales, which were sold at a discounted rate of $30 for the day. The Wild Boar Tavern at Bromley also donated 50 percent of its food sales to the cause, totaling $2,257. Participants and community members made additional donations on Mom’s Day Off, including a $2,000 gift from the Women of Willard, that brought the grand total this year to $11,988.\n“Our cancer center has an exceptional team in place to support our patients,” said Dee. “These philanthropic dollars make it possible for that team to go further and provide support that goes beyond treatments. Thank you to Bromley, the Wild Boar Tavern and everyone who came out to make this possible.”",
