  "text": "Mumbai: Renowned Bollywood actor, Suniel Shetty has not only captivated audiences with his powerful acting but his fitness is an inspiration to many people above 50. The actor&apos;s stylish appearances and active presence on social media have left his fans in awe. The 62-year-old actor maintains his fitness through a diet plan and conscious lifestyle choices. Let&apos;s take motivation from his dietary habits and lifestyle, to stay fit.\nIn his interviews, he talked about his diet secrets. Let&apos;s dive into Suniel Shetty&apos;s meal plans.\nSuniel Shetty&apos;s Diet Plan\nHe revealed that he keeps a count of his calories for whatever he eats and balances his meals according to body requirements. Egg is a rich source of animal-based protein, Anna eats 4-5 egg whites for breakfast as egg whites are abundant in protein and egg yolk in fats. He prefers eating simple food for his lunch and dinner. He consumes nutritious ragi roti, dal, and sabji, or meat. During the evening, he opts for a chicken soup or broth. He loves sweet potatoes which are good for our immune system besides various other health benefits and that too are a part of his snacks.\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Suniel Shetty (@suniel.shetty)\n\\n While these were the DOS, let&apos;s talk about DONT&apos;S. He restricts himself from eating all types of white foods for healthy living such as sugar, rice, milk, paneer, and other white foods. He doesn&apos;t support protein supplements. He admitted in his interview that he tried them but realised they weren&apos;t good for his body so he stopped taking them. He therefore depends on natural protein sources for a balanced diet and body requirements.\nSuniel Shetty&apos;s Lifestyle Choices\nHis lifestyle choices include going to bed by 10:30 p.m. as he prefers getting up early which has its advantages. He wakes up at 5 am daily, allowing himself four to five hours of personal time before diving into work. He allocates this time to yoga and breathing exercises which are essential for mental clarity and peace.\nHe has earlier emphasised in his interviews, the importance of a strict routine, mentioning that he always eats meals at set times- lunch at one and dinner at seven and prefers to have homemade food.\nHe also mentioned that he hits the gym without his phone, spends quality time with his family, including his mother, wife, and children, and plays with his pets.\nSuniel Shetty believes his routine is the cornerstone of his good health and optimistic outlook on life, enabling him to take control of his time and shape his schedule.",
