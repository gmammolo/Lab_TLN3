  "text": "Intensive Peer Support Group For Alcoholics In Toms River Helps Prevent Relapses\n[HealingUS Communities](/healingus-communities/) - Thursday, April 4, 2024.\nIf you’ve successfully completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation, you’ve taken a very important first step toward recovery. So then, you must be wondering, “What’s next?” If you’ve been left at a loss for what to do when it comes to starting over after substance abuse, HealingUS Communities can help you. In fact, that’s exactly what their Intensive Peer Recovery Program is for. With this four-week-long program, you’ll be able to connect with people just like you and learn about life after addiction together.\nTake another step toward recovery at\nhttps://healingus.org/intensive-peer-recovery-program/\nPeer Support and Substance Abuse\nPeer support provides numerous benefits to individuals suffering from substance use disorders, especially when delivered in tandem with clinical treatment. According to a scientific review in Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation, studies have shown that members of peer support groups experience increased self-esteem, positive feelings of accomplishment, and a heightened ability to cope with challenges.\nIt makes sense. Peers who relate to your struggles can help you out, and you’ll be able to do the same for them. Gather a whole community, and you’ll end up with a virtuous cycle of everyone encouraging one another.\nHealingUS Communities’ Intensive Peer Recovery Program, or IPRP for short, is a more intensive option compared to typical peer support groups. It’s not just about getting you off alcohol or drugs for good; it focuses on reintroducing you to a sober lifestyle, too. The end goal of the program is to empower you with the means to achieve long-term abstinence by allowing you to connect with other members of HealingUS.\nBy the way, HealingUS is recognized as one of the most successful recovery communities in Toms River. So even if everything seems hopeless and you feel like you’re all alone… You’re not. There are many other people here who have been in your position before, and now they can help you too.\nRelearn Life Skills for Long-Term Sober Living\nThroughout the program, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in individual and group skill sessions that are intended to help you transition into society. These sessions will be facilitated by trained Peers in Recovery, who will aid you in gaining independence, regulating your emotions, and relearning life skills essential for the earliest stages of recovery.\nBecause HealingUS Communities acknowledges there are many ways to recover from addiction, the IPRP will also teach you recovery skills through 12-step facilitation and specific programs such as Refuge Recovery, Recover 2.0, and SMART Recovery. Knowledge is power, and the more knowledge you have, the stronger you’ll be. These programs are all about giving you that strength.\nThe IPRP will help you keep track of your progress, too. During the program, you’ll form a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), which you can discuss and revise through weekly meetings with your recovery coaches. And if you happen to need additional clinical care and mental health services, you can consult your peer case managers. They’ll provide you with the resources to secure the treatment you require.\nDedicated to Helping Families Affected by Substance Abuse\nHealingUS Communities is a New Jersey 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was founded in 2012 to fill the gaps in alcohol and drug addiction treatment. Their recovery programs have helped thousands of families to date.\nEveryone has a different story behind their addiction, but no matter what yours is, you deserve care, and you deserve to live. Don’t let addiction shackle you or your family any longer.
