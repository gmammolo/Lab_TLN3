  "text": "Oregon football's Jestin Jacobs on finding rhythm in first healthy offseason since 2022 After injuries derailed a promising start to his career at Iowa, Jestin Jacobs transferred to Oregon before last season, with more injuries nagging at the inside linebacker throughout the summer and fall camp. Finally, about halfway through the Ducks' season against Washington State, [Jacobs made his Duck debut](https://www.registerguard.com/story/sports/college/football/2023/10/21/oregon-ducks-football-linebacker-jestin-jacobs-plays-first-game-after-injury-pac-12/71277798007/) and played the final eight games of the season at close to full health. Now in the second official week of spring ball, Jacobs is fully healthy for the first offseason since 2022 at Iowa. \"It's very important for me,\" Jacobs said. \"A fully healthy offseason you just get into a flow. In football you like to get in a rhythm. When you're missing time and you're in and out, you're missing the flow. You're not getting the footwork that you get on a daily basis seeing football. \"When you're available that's when you're getting better. When you're sitting out, it's not the same.\" Over his eight games last season Jacobs finished with 32 total tackles and a sack in his first game against the Cougars, and had a decision to make whether or not he'd enter the NFL draft or return for a second season at Oregon. To Jacobs, it wasn't much of a decision at all. \"I missed half the year, I didn't get a full year with the guys,\" he said. \"So in my mind, I have a lot left to prove that I didn't show.\" The incoming senior said he's particularly worked at getting his body right so he can stay on the field, and studied the playbook again so he can help fellow senior inside linebacker Jeffrey Bassa captain the middle of the defense. \"That's been the biggest change for me so far is the confidence in knowing the defense and being able to relay it,\" Jacobs said. \" It's been a gigantic jump in confidence. Even during the season I was a little hesitant with the defense, now when we had the time off and I got to dive back into the playbook ... it grew in confidence.\" Alec Dietz covers University of Oregon football, volleyball, women’s basketball and baseball for The Register-Guard.
