  "text": "The [San Diego Padres](/mlb/san-diego-padres) and [San Francisco Giants](/mlb/san-francisco-giants) meet for the Giants home-opener! It's time to continue our MLB odds [series](https://clutchpoints.com/betting) with a Padres-Giants prediction and pick. The Padres and Giants just split a series in San Diego for Opening Weekend. After SD took Game 1, the Giants responded with two impressive wins led by newly added third baseman Matt Chapman. Chapman reunited with Bob Melvin in the Bay Area once again and so far it seems as if it's a perfect fit. The Padres are (4-5) on the season and the Giants are (2-5) after getting swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in LA. Here are the [MLB Odds](https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/mlb), courtesy of FanDuel. MLB Odds: Padres-Giants Odds San Diego Padres: -1.5 (+172) Moneyline: -102 San Francisco Giants: +1.5 (-210) Moneyline: -116 Over: 7.5 (+100) Under: 7.5 (-122) How to Watch Padres vs. Giants Time: 4:35 ET/1:35 PT TV: MLBTV Stream: fuboTV ( [Click for free trial](https://www.fubo.tv/stream/mlb/?irad=377812&irmp=492408)) Why The Padres Will Cover The Spread/Win Dylan Cease is on the mound for his second start in a Padres uniform. In his first outing against this Giants squad, he earned the loss allowing three runs (two earned) in the 9-6 loss to the boys up north. He lasted only 4.2 innings but on the bright side, he did K up six hitters and allowed only two hits. It just so happened that Fernando Tatis Jr. misread a ball in the outfield which resulted in extra base runners and a run. If he can keep the pitch count within reason, we could see Cease pitch a quality start Friday night. The reigning Platinum Glove defender is leading the Padres offensively with a .303 average and three home runs. The Friars are seeing some solid offensive production from a handful of guys who are all batting over .286. Jake Cronenworth, Xander Bogaerts, and Tatis all have 10 hits on the season. However, Luis Campusano has 12 on the year which is fourth in the league and is second among all catchers. The only three hitters with more are Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, and Will Smith. If Campusano can keep up his hot hitting with a line of .400/.400/.600 and OPS of 1.000, then the Padres' lineup can be dangerous. Why The Giants Will Cover The Spread/Win Toeing the slab for the Giants is right-hander Jordan Hicks. In his first outing as a full-time starter against the Friars last week, Hicks pitched as well as you could hope for. In five shutout innings, he struck out six hitters and allowed only three hits. The 27-year-old has expressed his desire to start and he proved it. He has spent most of his time as a reliever as that is what the St. Louis Cardinals are known for doing with their pitching prospects. Now as a Giant, he can revamp his career as a starter. Expect him to once again showcase his stamina by going another four-plus innings against San Diego. The offense did not travel well from SD to LA over the weekend. They kept all three games close for the most part but failed to capitalize on key moments to take down the Dodgers. SF only had five hits in the finale which won't be enough to win ballgames. Jung Hoo Lee only had three hits in the series and Matt Chapman only had two. If the Giants are to bounce back, then those two newcomers will need to be a major part of it in front of their home crowd. Michael Conforto is batting .370 with 10 hits on the season. He has been most of the offense for SF to begin the campaign. Final Padres-Giants Prediction & Pick You don't see this too often, the Padres are favored on the spread while the Giants are favored on moneyline. The oddsmakers are predicting a close game which will result in a one-run contest. The Giants are home for their home opener and I expect them to keep this within a run at the very least. Take them to cover the spread against the Padres despite the high cost.
