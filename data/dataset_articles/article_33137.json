  "text": "Maine teen with autism finds success with dog cookie business WALDOBORO, Maine (WABI) - Landen Stewart of Waldoboro was just 3-years-old when he was diagnosed with autism. He’s nonverbal and is also living with a genetic disorder called Fragile X Syndrome, which can cause a range of developmental problems. Now 18, the Medomak Valley High School senior has a few new skills under his belt thanks to his new business, [K9 Kookies.](https://www.k9kookiesonline.com/) Most afternoons after school, you can find Landen sitting at his dining room table with the music cranked up, filling orders of homemade dog cookies. Each one is shaped like a puzzle piece, a symbol for autism. “He helps us with the baking,” said his mom, Danielle Stewart. “That’s not his favorite thing. He doesn’t love to get his hands dirty, so that is a work in progress, but he does all the labeling and all the packaging,” she added. “There’s just limited opportunities for adults with his abilities, so we wanted to find something that he would be passionate about doing.” [K9 Kookies](https://www.k9kookiesonline.com/shop) was born last summer and has really taken off thanks to social media. These days, Landen makes his peanut butter and pumpkin dog treats with help from a furry assistant, a three-month-old Mini Goldendoodle. The family plans to use the proceeds from K9 Kookies to help send Piper to training so she can become a certified service dog for Landen. That process can be quite costly. “We’re going to have to sell a lot of cookies,” Danielle said. Landen has developed several skills in this business. He’s also learning how to interact with his local community. In addition to his online shop, Landen’s creations can be found at 11 Maine stores. “I’m not sure what number store it was, but my husband and I were meeting the owners of the store, so we shook his hand and Landen just independently stuck his hand out to shake his hand, too. My husband and I just looked at each other with our mouths gaped open because we were like, “Oh my word!” From observing us, he picked up that skill, and he has done it several times now. He’s learning more skills that really what we anticipated,” Stewart said. “We just want to give him the skills to communicate, and if he can advocate for himself. You can’t give up. They’re your kids.” Copyright 2024 WABI. All rights reserved.",
