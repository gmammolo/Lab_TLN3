  "text": "Minneapolis-based THC beverage company Trail Magic took home a national award this week for best cannabis-infused, ready-to-drink cocktail.\nTrail Magic, which was launched in 2022 by Minneapolis Cider Co., received the recognition during 2024′s High Spirits Awards in California — a national celebration of cannabinoid-infused beverages. The winning flavor was the half and half iced tea-lemonade, which contains 5mg of THC per can.\nTrail Magic co-founder Jason Dayton said in a statement that he thinks the company has separated itself from the rapidly growing number of THC beverage options nationwide by always prioritizing good flavor.",
