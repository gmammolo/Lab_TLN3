  "text": "\nCount on Amazon for a surplus of beauty products, especially in the hair care department. Shoppers can score anything from strengthening shampoos to scalp oils. They can even find solutions for thinning hair and hair regrowth that won’t cost an arm and a leg. The Angflower Hair Growth Oil was one of the top formulations to catch our eye thanks to its 94 percent shopper approval rating (and $20 price tag).\nAmazon Angflower Hair Growth Oil $19.95 Buy Now As one reviewer dealing with aging, thinning locks wrote, “I researched a lot of products and came across this hair growth oil and decided to try it. From the first application I noticed how smooth and soft my hair was, and after about a week’s use…I’m seeing less hair falling out and a full texture that’s come back. I have very curly hair which I like to straighten, and there’s a silky component to this hair growth oil that definitely helps the straightening process with the blow dryer, and the result is a lot smoother and sleeker.” Related Stories People Say This $30 Target Active Dress Is the Perfect Lululemon Dupe\nWhat makes the hair treatment work is its hero list of follicle-boosting ingredients: rice water, biotin, castor oil, rosemary oil, ginger oil and caffeine. Suitable for use on both men and women, the oil effectively treats hair loss by revitalizing the hair from roots to ends . It repairs split ends with every application while soothing irritated scalps for optimal health.\nHundreds of users have taken to Amazon to put into words their experiences, from loving the serum as a softening treatment for damaged ends to using it to restart growth after seeing extensive fallout.\n“I have been using it for a few weeks now and it’s absolutely great,” shared another. “The smell isn’t heavy and makes my hair smell great, not to mention the best part: It doesn’t leave my hair greasy and oily… I’ve noticed a difference in my hair at the roots in terms of baby hairs growing. I’m not balding but the thinning areas aren’t thinning any more. I highly recommend this treatment.”\nGrab the Angflower Hair Growth Oil for only $20 on Amazon. We’d be pressed to find a more effective and affordable option on the market.",
