  "text": "The Agriculture Ministry is paying special attention to the destruction of nearly 40% of fresh Vegetable and Fruits, while being transported from distant cultivation areas to major vegetable markets, including at Dambulla, Peliyagoda and other vegetable markets, and said proper transportation guidelines should be maintained to minimise the destruction of Vegetables and Fruits. According to the Industrial Technology Institute of Sri Lanka (ITISL),Vegetable and Fruits are mainly transported from the cultivation Districts of Dambulla, Peliyagoda, Polonnaruwa, Giritale, Nuwara Eliya, Welimada, Ampara and Anuradhapura to countrywide Economic Centres, and from there to Colombo and suburban towns. Agriculture Minister Minister Mahhinda Amaraweera said Vegetable and Fruit destruction during transportations could be decreased from the current 40% to at least around 10%, by using Plastic crates to transport certain varieties of Vegetables and Fruits such as Tomatoes, Cabbage, Leeks, Green vegetable, Lime, Chilies, Capsicum, Oranges, Mangoes, Pineapple, Grapes etc. The Minister also highlighted that, in addition, destruction of Vegetable and Fruits could also be minimised if the harvest of certain Vegetables such as Ladies fingers, Beans, Dambala and String Beans and also Fruits such as Papaw, Mangoes and Pineapple are done at the proper time, before they mature. ITISL reports also indicate that many farmers harvest without following proper agricultural guidelines, in order to maximise profits from their harvest. According to research, Vegetable cannot be preserved for long periods when workers are seated on gunny bags full of fresh Vegetables during transportation. Meanwhile, Peliyagoda Manning Market Vegetable Traders Association, member Somasiri Peiris said, in addition, a large quantity of Vegetable and Fruits need not be destroyed if Railway transportation is strengthened by the Agriculture Ministry. He said due to this situation around 3,000 kg of Vegetables and Fruits are considered garbage almost every day.",
