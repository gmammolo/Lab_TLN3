The Duke of Sussex is keen on repairing their bond, especially since King Charles was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year. A source revealed to The Mirror, &quot;Harry&apos;s first priority when he comes to England is to see his sick dad. He is pretty focused on this. It will be his first port of call when he comes off the plane to try and spend as much time with King Charles so that they can build bridges, and enjoy each other&apos;s company like before.&quot; The source further emphasized Harry&apos;s determination to make the most of his time with his family during his visit, stating, &quot;He wants the family to get back to the way they were and is going to be making extra effort with his brother Wills too, as difficult as it may be. Now, more than ever, with Kate&apos;s cancer diagnosis too, Harry wants them to know he is there for them.&quot; Prince Harry talks seeing King Charles amid cancer battle Additionally, it was mentioned that Harry will be juggling his schedule around his charity work for the Invictus Games to ensure he can spend as much time as possible with his father. The source highlighted, &quot;Harry knows it will be awkward, but it&apos;s a time to put pride and differences to one side. He is coming over for his charity work, which is so important to him so he will juggle his schedule accordingly, but seeing his dad will come first.&quot; During his previous visit, Harry was granted a brief 30-minute audience with his father just before King Charles commenced his cancer treatment. Despite the limited time, Harry was said to be appreciative of the opportunity to see him.
