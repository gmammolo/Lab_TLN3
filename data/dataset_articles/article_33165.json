  "text": "Replacing your old refrigerator with an efficient model is one of the quickest ways to reduce energy costs. Major strides have been made in refrigerator efficiency over the decades.\nChoose fridges with ENERGY STAR ratings that meet strict energy-efficiency guidelines. Keep your refrigerator running efficiently by regularly cleaning coils and checking seals.\nEnergy Efficiency\nEnergy-efficient refrigerators like\n[Samsun](blank) g can save you money by reducing your electricity bills. They also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is great for the planet and your family’s health. If you’re thinking about buying a new fridge, check out Energy Star’s best picks for energy-efficient models. These appliances meet strict energy consumption standards set by the Department of Energy. They also offer great savings compared to older models that were less efficient. You can also improve your appliance’s efficiency by adjusting its location. Avoid placing it in direct sunlight, next to the oven or dishwasher, or anywhere else where the air may be warmer than it should be. It’s also helpful to vacuum the refrigerator coils several times a year to keep them clean and working efficiently.\nAnother benefit of energy-efficient refrigerators is that they require fewer maintenance services and repairs than traditional models. This can save you time, money, and hassles like food spoiling while you wait for a repairperson to visit your home. In addition, they tend to last longer than standard refrigerators, which can further reduce your long-term costs. Some governments even offer incentives like rebates and tax reductions for people who buy energy-efficient fridges. The initial investment can pay for itself within a few years thanks to the yearly electricity cost savings.\nConvenience\nOne of the biggest benefits of owning a refrigerator is that it can help you save money in the long run. For example, a fridge allows you to store food and beverages for longer periods, which can reduce waste by letting you enjoy fresher items before they spoil. Refrigerators are also more energy efficient than ever before, which can save you on electricity costs.\nWhile it’s important to remember that even energy-efficient appliances consume a significant amount of electricity, it’s also good to look for further ways to reduce your usage. The most obvious way to do this is to turn off your fridge when you’re not using it. While the insulation of modern fridges is strong enough not to let the contents warm up too much while it’s turned off, you can further cut down on power consumption by keeping the door shut as much as possible.\nAnother way to reduce electricity usage is to choose a model that matches your family’s storage needs. You don’t want to purchase a fridge with more capacity than you need, which will cost you extra monthly electricity costs. Instead, prioritize must-have qualities like icemakers, humidity-controlled drawers and adjustable shelves before you go overboard on gimmicks like built-in K-Cup dispensers or smart features that sync up to your home Wi-Fi.\nStyle\nRefrigerators consume significant household energy, so choosing an efficient model can help you reduce your electricity bills. The good news is that fridges have come a long way in terms of efficiency in recent years. By shopping for a refrigerator that is ENERGY STAR certified, you can be sure that you are getting the most out of your appliance.\nHaving the right refrigerator for your home can save you money on food costs. For example, if you cook many meals from scratch, consider investing in a fridge with a standalone freezer. This allows you to turn leftovers into sauces, compotes and more for later use, saving you a lot of money over time.\nThe style of your refrigerator is another important consideration, especially regarding storage and accessibility. Top-freezer refrigerators are the most affordable and typically have a freezer on the bottom and a fridge on the top, making them a popular choice for many kitchens. Side-by-side refrigerators are more customizable and offer a wider interior space, ideal for viewing their most frequently used items from an eye-level position.\nFinally, look for models with fewer doors, as this can minimize air leakage and help you save even more on your electric bill. It’s also worth noting that the type of refrigerant a refrigerator uses can impact your energy savings. Consider looking for refrigerators that use low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants, as these have a less negative environmental impact.\nStorage\nA refrigerator keeps food cool, slowing bacterial growth and spoilage. This reduces the need to throw away foods that would otherwise rot, which helps save money and resources. It also helps reduce food waste, which contributes to climate change. Refrigerators are among the biggest energy consumers in the home, but proper maintenance can help them run more efficiently.\nWhen choosing a refrigerator, consider your household size and whether you have space for multiple refrigerators. The larger a fridge is, the more energy it uses. Look for a model that is the right size and avoid side-by-side fridges, which could be more efficient. Classic top and bottom fridges are more\nenergy-efficient than French door models.\nStoring foods in the correct order can further increase efficiency. Foods that require the lowest internal cooking temperature should be held first, followed by those that require the highest. This can prevent foods that need to be cooked quickly from overcooking and becoming mushy before they are ready to eat.\nA refrigerator is one of the largest, most expensive appliances you own, so taking care of it is important. If you need to store your refrigerator temporarily, ensure its properly ventilated to prevent mold and mildew buildup. You can also use a natural cleaning solution from cheap vodka to disinfect your refrigerator without the harsh chemicals in store-bought cleaners.\nBecome a Harlem Insider!\nBy submitting this form, you are consenting to receive marketing emails from: Harlem World Magazine, 2521 1/2 west 42nd street, Los Angeles, CA, 90008, https://www.harlemworldmagazine.com.
