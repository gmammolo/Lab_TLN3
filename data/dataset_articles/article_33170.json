  "text": "Carrots, from their lush (and edible) green tops to their orange (or white, yellow, purple) roots, are not only visually appealing but also rich in essential nutrients that can benefit your overall well-being.\nAs their name suggests, carrots are abundant in plant compounds called carotenoids. These pigments not only give carrots their characteristic color but also play a crucial role in maintaining healthy eyesight. The age-old adage of eating carrots for better vision isn’t just an old wives’ tale! Carotenoids, particularly beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, are known to support eye health by protecting against age-related macular degeneration and cataracts.\nWhether you prefer to munch on them raw, roast them to caramelized perfection or bake them into cakes, carrots retain their carotenoid content through various cooking methods. Adding a touch of fat or oil to your carrot-based dishes can enhance nutrient absorption, ensuring that you reap the maximum benefits from these colorful root vegetables.\nLooking for inspiration to incorporate more carrots into your diet? Below are 9 ways to enjoy these root vegetables at any time of day — yes, even in desserts!\nCrispy Carrot Tacos (Tacos Dorados de Zanahoria)\nThese are deceptively easy and don’t need much beyond raw carrots and salt. You’ll need toothpicks to secure them closed while cooking.\nHoney Sesame Carrot Salad\nInstead of roasting the carrots, let their natural crunch and flavor shine in this raw salad.\nRecipe from Edible San Diego\nTip-to-Top Barbeque Maple Glazed Carrots with Carrot Top Salsa Verde\nAs the name suggests, this recipe uses the entire carrot — from tip to top — and can be served as a starter, main course or side dish.\nRecipe from Edible Rhody\nCarrot Cake Breakfast Cookies\nIf you love the exterior crunch, do not seal the cookies in an airtight container or they will get soft. Keep the lid ajar!\nRecipe from Edible Bozeman\nCarrot Lox\nMarinated in a savory blend of tamari, liquid smoke and nori, the thinly sliced carrots develop a rich, smoky flavor reminiscent of lox.\nRecipe from Edible Ottawa\nRoasted Carrot Ginger Soup\nYou stir in the ginger at the end of cooking, so you can adjust the amount to your spice level.\nRecipe from Edible Jersey\nCarrots with Mint Caper Tapenade\nThe roasted carrots rest on a bright green bed of fresh tapenade made with four simple ingredients: mint, capers, walnuts and olive oil. This dish can be served warm or at room temperature.\nRecipe from Edible Monterey Bay\nCarrot Mustard Cake\nDon’t knock it ’til you try it. This cake pairs well with an equally unique Mustard, Honey & Fennel Ice Cream.\nRecipe from Edible East Bay\nCarrot Salad with Spices & Pistachios\nWhen it comes to using carrots in a salad, we often think about grating them to add crunch and color. This recipe takes a completely different direction as the carrots are steamed instead and served cold.\nRecipe from Edible Boston",
