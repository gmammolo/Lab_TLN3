  "text": "This $13 Deodorant Eliminates Odor, Fades Discoloration, and Prevents Ingrowns For the longest time, I was not a fan of wearing deodorant. For starters, traditional deodorants would make my underarm area darker and hyperpigmented. On top of that, they would irritate my skin, resulting in breakouts, and the ingrown hairs didn't help. I was super self-conscious about my darker underarms, but I didn't want to smell bad either. To help alleviate some of the breakouts and ingrown hairs, I started to treat the area with skin-care products. Since I'm acne-prone , I applied a range of AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids, like glycolic acid and lactic acid) and BHAs (beta hydroxy acids, like salicylic acid) and employed the viral TikTok hack of using The Ordinary's Glycolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner . If it works for my face, it should work for my underarms. Sure enough, using AHAs and BHAs helped clear up my underarm area and even out my skin tone, and it completely replaced my need for deodorant. As more brands start to incorporate AHAs and BHAs in their deodorant formulas, Billie's AHA Deodorant ($13) in particular piqued my interest. The packaging is cute and it comes in fresh scents, while alternatives in the market are a bit more clinical and unscented. Plus, it's pretty affordable at $13. Keep reading to see why Billie's AHA Deodorant is worth the hype. About the Billie AHA Deodorant - It is a 24-hour odor-preventing gel, safe for all skin types. - It is formulated with a five percent blend of mandelic acid, lactic acid, gluconolactone, and salicylic acid to help exfoliate the skin and unclog pores, block odor-causing bacteria, and even out the skin's texture and tone. - It comes in three scents: Tidal Rose (ocean salt with white florals), Lavender Milk (fresh lavender with pink pepper), and Botanic Air (soft marine breeze with wild herbs). - It's vegan and cruelty-free, and free of aluminum, baking soda, parabens, and sulfates. What I Like About the Billie AHA Deodorant Although you can use a regular AHA/BHA toner for your underarms, sometimes that can be too strong for the sensitive underarm area. The Bille AHA Deodorant is specifically formulated for the delicate skin in that area, and as a result, I experienced no over-exfoliation or peeling. Although it's gentle, it's still effective at preventing and fading discoloration and ingrown hairs, while also keeping the underarms smooth and soft. Because of its multi-acid formulation, it is still effective at eliminating odor-causing bacteria, just like a regular AHA toner. What I love about the deodorant is its fresh, clean scent. I don't want my deodorant to smell overpowering or to compete with my perfume. I tried two of the three aquatic and floral scents: Lavender Milk and Tidal Rose. Both are light enough to complement my other fragrances but long-lasting, so they don't fade as the day goes on. From workouts to stuffy subways, or anything that typically makes me break a sweat, I still can't smell any trace of my body odor. Plus, the formula goes on clear and dries quickly, so you don't need to worry about staining clothes or getting the gel everywhere. How to Use the Billie AHA Deodorant Billie's AHA Deodorant has a roll-on applicator that makes it convenient and mess-free to apply the gel directly to my underarms. A little goes a long way with this gel deodorant. The formula takes around 30 seconds to dry down completely, so I like to apply it, then keep my hands raised and do a mini upward stretch. I've noticed that if I apply too much of the product, it settles with a stickier finish. What to Consider Before Trying the Billie AHA Deodorant The AHA Deodorant is an odor-eliminating gel, but it does not necessarily prevent sweating. It's not an antiperspirant and doesn't replace one, especially if you're prone to sweating. Where Is the Billie AHA Deodorant Available? The Billie AHA Dedorant is available on the brand's site and at Walmart . Rating: ★★★★ Anvita Reddy is an assistant editor for POPSUGAR Shopping.
