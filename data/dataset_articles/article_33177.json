  "text": "This makes about 700 locations of The Vitamin Shoppe and Super Supplements available to Uber Eats consumers in the United States. “The Vitamin Shoppe is a growth-focused business with a digital-first mindset that is continuously transforming the way we serve our customers, by reaching them where and when they want to shop,” said Muriel Gonzalez, president of The Vitamin Shoppe, in a statement . On-demand, same-day delivery from our stores via Uber Eats provides a fast and convenient way for our customers to access their favorite health and wellness products.” The Vitamin Shoppe orders via Uber Eats will count toward the retailer’s loyalty program. They’re also eligible for cash-back rewards, according to the statement. Similarly, members of Uber One, Uber’s subscription program, “will benefit from a $0 Delivery Fee and up to 10% off all eligible orders with a $15 minimum purchase.” “Nutrition needs are personal, and often urgent,” said Beryl Sanders, director of U.S. Grocery & Retail partnerships at Uber. “That’s one of the reasons we’re most excited to bring The Vitamin Shoppe onto Uber Eats to help consumers find what they need on the app with a few taps — from vitamins and supplements to sports nutrition and on-the-go healthy snacks and drinks — and have it delivered to their doorsteps within hours, if not minutes.” The Vitamin Shoppe Industries Inc. ranks No. 286 in the Top 1000 Database . The Top 1000 is Digital Commerce 360’s ranking of North America’s largest online retailers by annual web sales. Recent delivery partnerships In a comparable first, Lowe’s on April 4 became the first hardware and home improvement retailer to partner with DoorDash .

Sephora falls under LVMH, which ranks No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360’s Europe Database . Grocery retailer Hy-Vee began partnering with Instacart on Feb. 8 for same-day delivery. In December, Instacart teamed up with several retailers for a pre-Christmas sales period. Do you rank in our database?
