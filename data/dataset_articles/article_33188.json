  "text": "Match Day 2024: 8 SGU Students Secure Residency Positions in Canada Through CaRMS Match\nEight St. George’s University students will be joining the healthcare system in Canada this summer with MDs at the end of their names, having matched into competitive residency programs through the first iteration of the\nCanadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) R-1 Main Residency Match.\nStudents matched into residency programs in four Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. More SGU students are expected to earn residency positions in the second Canadian Match iteration on April 25.\n“We are extremely proud of our students for matching into competitive programs across the country,” said Jibran Vahidy, SGU’s director of admissions and partnerships, Canada. “These students will join hundreds of other SGU alumni who have returned to Canada to pursue their medical careers. We acknowledge and celebrate their accomplishments, as well as the positive impact they will have on communities as well-rounded, caring, and competent physicians.”\nDr. Alexandra Robertson, MD ’23, felt a combination of relief, excitement and “pure joy” upon learning that she matched into an internal medicine residency at the University of Alberta.\nDr. Robertson, who hails from Edmonton, Alberta, is looking forward to returning home to practice medicine and to “continue to grow both as a doctor and as a person as I navigate whatever new challenges residency brings.”\n“My journey in medicine at SGU has taken me from the United Kingdom, to Grenada, and across the United States and Canada. I have been enriched by being exposed to many different healthcare systems, electronic medical records, teaching environments, team structures, cultures, and patient populations. I have had the good fortune of being able to make deep and meaningful connections with mentors and friends along the way,” Dr. Roberston said. “The path is difficult but rewarding for those who are willing to go on an adventure!”\nOn March 15, more than 930 SGU students and graduates secured post-graduate residencies at health centers around the United States in the 2024 match cycle. Visit our\n2024 residency listing page for a complete list of SGU physicians who will begin their residencies this summer.\n– Laurie Chartorynsky and Juliette Kimmins\nRelated Reading",
