  "text": "BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — An inaugural event in Brunswick County explored life sciences and medical technology in the area. The town of Leland hosted a Life Science and Medical Technology Summit at the Leland Cultural Arts Center on Thursday. Medical devices and diagnostics, biotechnology, and drug discovery were just a few of the topics touched among many others. Leaders on both a local and state level attended, sharing ideas and gathering information on advancements in the industry. Barnes Sutton is Leland’s Economic and Community Development Director. He said Thursday was all about showcasing life sciences and medical technology in the area and what’s to come. “It’s really about building relationships, there’s a lot of them that already exist but kind of in an informal way. Because Leland isn’t necessarily known for life sciences. But I think we have an opportunity to change that,” Sutton said. “I think with some of the businesses here, they’re doing really good with global and national work. I think we can really define Leland as a hub for life sciences.” Sutton said Cygnus Technologies, Flow Sciences, and MicroSolv Technology Corporation were just a few of the company’s sharing discussion at Thursday’s event.",
