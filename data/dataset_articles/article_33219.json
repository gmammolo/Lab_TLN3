  "text": "Bushwacker Spirits has splashed down in Massachusetts. Bushwacker Spirits Bushwacker ready-to-drink cream cocktail has hit retail shelves in 750ml & 50ml formats across the state. Describing how the traditional Bushwacker cocktail is created, co-founders Carter Echols and Michael Smith explain “It’s four or five different ingredients depending on which recipe you’re using, and you can’t always find them.” Smith says, “We were like, ‘This needs to be in a bottle.’ So, that spurred the idea.” Bushwacker Rum Cream is an impassioned homage to the traditional Bushwacker cocktail, that’s solved the problem of hunting down hard to find ingredients and keeping them readily on hand by combining premium Caribbean Rum and real dairy cream with decadent flavors of chocolate, coffee, and coconut. Bushwacker Spirits can’t wait to bring the Bushwacker way of life to Massachusetts and introduce Massachusettsans to their rich and creamy cocktail that is an experience sure to transform even the most mundane moments.
