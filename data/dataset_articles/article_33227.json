  "text": "Gaza is an awakening for the world Intl. Quds Day will be observed in 2024 as millions more have grown close to the Palestinian cause TEHRAN - The annual observance of International Quds Day by millions of Muslims worldwide serves as a significant platform to express solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Particularly this year, amidst the ongoing conflict in Gaza, a surge in global participation is anticipated, as the brutal realities of the Israeli regime's actions have galvanized international attention. Over the past six months, a wave of protests has swept through various parts of the world, challenging the narratives put forth by governments, especially in Western nations. The calls for a ceasefire resonate with the shared humanity that transcends divides of religion, ethnicity, and nationality. Across diverse communities, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and individuals from all walks of life, a unified voice emerges in Western cities, demanding an end to the tragic plight of civilians in Gaza. The harrowing scenes unfolding in Gaza, captured on mobile devices and independent broadcast worldwide, showcase the devastating toll of the conflict. Images of innocent children trapped in the rubble, families torn apart by violence, and entire neighborhoods reduced to ruins underscore the indiscriminate nature of Israel's military assaults on civilian infrastructure. The profound human tragedy and widespread devastation unfolding in Gaza have shattered the longstanding narratives perpetuated by Western states, challenging the perceptions ingrained in the minds of people worldwide. The stark contrast between the sanitized official accounts and the grim realities faced by those enduring the brunt of conflict has raised great doubts and prompted a reevaluation of the information disseminated by Western authorities. Amidst the chaos and destruction caused by 2,000-ton Israeli bombs raining down on Gaza, those fortunate enough to escape immediate harm find themselves thrust into a desperate struggle for survival. The scarcity of food and essential resources plunges individuals into a race against time, as the basic necessities for sustenance become increasingly scarce. The crumbling healthcare infrastructure adds to the horrors, with a severe shortage of medical personnel rendering the wounded and sick without proper care. Tragic scenes unfold as infants are deprived of life-saving incubators, women endure unspeakable atrocities, and children grapple with heart-wrenching trauma that sometimes manifests as heart attacks. The staggering toll of over 32,000 Palestinian lives lost at the hands of Israeli forces is the most horrifying part for the Western public. People see the insatiable thirst for bloodshed exhibited by Israel and its unchecked violence, perpetuating a cycle of suffering that shows no signs of abating. As people were grappling with the distressing reality in Gaza, they began a deeper examination of the historical context revealing the longstanding oppression faced by Palestinians. They found out that the roots of the conflict trace back over seven decades to the Nakba, a catastrophic event that led to the forcible displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes. The enduring struggle for autonomy and freedom has left over 5 million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank living under occupation, devoid of basic rights and subject to the whims of Israeli authorities. The restrictions imposed on Palestinians, from limitations on construction and economic activities to strict controls on movement and access to resources, underscore the extent of their subjugation. Despite repeated attempts at resistance, both through diplomatic channels and acts of defiance, Palestinian aspirations for self-determination have been repeatedly thwarted by a regime backed by powerful Western allies. Palestinians continue to struggle for justice, dignity, and the right to a homeland as they get labeled by Israel and its Western lackeys as terrorists. Meanwhile, Western leaders find themselves grappling with a glaring lack of coherent and justifiable reasoning behind their unwavering support for Israel. The erosion of credibility among global audiences transcends mere public perception, signaling a broader crisis of legitimacy that has far-reaching implications. Critics argue that the blind allegiance to Israel not only undermines ethical principles but also undermines the very foundation of Western civilization's historical authority and moral standing on the global stage. Also, in this age of pervasive connectivity and digital empowerment, Israel's attempts to shape the narrative and control information are facing unprecedented scrutiny and resistance. The democratic nature of social media platforms and the rapid dissemination of information through emerging technologies have empowered individuals to uncover and share the truth, dismantling falsehoods and exposing propaganda efforts in real time. Whereas past disinformation campaigns took years to unravel, the speed at which misinformation is debunked in the digital age has left Israel's propaganda machinery vulnerable to swift and widespread debunking within hours or even minutes of dissemination. Perhaps even last year, nobody would have been able to predict that the truth would be revealed about Israel’s occupation of Palestine. People’s awakening across the world is only going to increase as you only need to be human in order to feel for the Palestinians.",
