  "text": "Wellness Wednesday’s April lineup continues to provide access to community wellness ROCKLAND — April's schedule boasts a lineup of offerings for Wellness Wednesdays, including complimentary acupuncture sessions by Abi of Red Bird Acupuncture, and free HIV/Hep C testing provided by MaineGeneral's Horizon Program on April 10. Additionally, attendees can enjoy free reiki services on April 24. The Coastal Recovery Community Center (CRCC) and Knox Clinic continue to host Wellness Wednesdays, providing a platform for community members to come together and access a range of holistic care services. Through this collaborative effort, individuals can experience rejuvenating practices such as acupuncture, reiki, mindfulness meditations, and more. “At the heart of Wellness Wednesdays are dedicated volunteers committed to fostering well-being within the community,” said Knox Clinic, in a news release. Each session offers a diverse array of services aimed at nurturing the mind, body, and spirit. Located at CRCC (11 White Street in Rockland), Wellness Wednesdays occur twice a month, on the 2nd Wednesday, from 1 to 3 p.m., and the 4th Wednesday, from 4 to 6 p.m. All members of the community are invited to participate and explore the benefits of holistic wellness. “For those eager to stay informed about upcoming services and events, we encourage joining the Wellness Wednesday group on Facebook,” said the release.
