  "text": "SM Foundation to intensify mobile health clinic operations with state-of-the-art technology and more medical missions The Philippines boasts a rich medical history and a dedicated healthcare workforce, as evident in the professionals across the globe who are showing their medical expertise and quality care in the field.\nYet despite the history and people who keep healthcare alive in the country, local grassroots communities don’t often receive access to fundamental health services and products.\nThe Mobile Clinic provide free diagnostic and laboratory services, such as ECG. Other concerns among Filipinos are the hefty sum they need to pay for medical bills and prescriptions, and the distance between some communities to the nearest hospital or clinic. It’s these inconveniences that discourage most people from seeking medical attention promptly.\nFortunately, SM Foundation Inc. (SMFI) is changing the dynamics with their mobile clinic, which conducts medical missions throughout the country.\nThe mobile clinic is equipped with a dedicated X-ray suite, enabling on-site imaging for patients participating in the medical mission. This allows for prompt radiological evaluation as determined by attending physicians. The program has accommodated around 1.4 million patients, and still counting, since its inception in 2001. It currently has five mobile clinics, which visit grassroots communities to provide free diagnostic and laboratory services, such as complete blood chemistry, x-rays, ECG, and more.\nAccording to Dr. Bless Bertos, SMFI Senior Project Manager, they envision a more productive year in 2024 for their mobile clinic program by visiting new destinations, particularly far-flung and underserved communities in the Philippines. Each medical mission opens its doors to around 300 to 1,000 people who hopes to receive its free services.\nThe utilization of mobile clinics in medical missions expands access to high-quality healthcare services for patients in underserved communities. Moreover, SMFI is also innovating to more modern equipment, starting with a more sensitive blood testing machine that draws specimens intravenously rather than the usual finger pricking for more accurate readings on complete blood chemistry with rapid turnarounds.\n“Filipinos’ health and well-being are at the heart of everything we do at SM Foundation’s Health and Medical Program. Through our years of service, we have seen firsthand how these communities struggle to reach specialists due to distance or finances,” Dr. Bertos said.\nThe SM Foundation implements a system for the efficient preparation of X-ray reports to help patients receive timely medical attention. “We, then, prioritize preventive care by bringing our mobile clinic directly to communities where healthcare access may be limited.”\n“By identifying the issues early on, we can avoid expensive treatments down the line. Beyond this, we can equip communities with a clear understanding of preventive healthcare. We know that it can help them make healthier choices and live better lives. That’s the kind of future we aspire to see for all Filipinos,” she said.\nThe utilization of mobile clinics in medical missions expands access to high-quality healthcare services for patients in underserved communities. SMFI also continues to foster partnerships with other stakeholders to scale their efforts and reach more communities. Some recent collaborations, which depend on the location, are with BDO Network Bank, Watsons, DMIRIE Foundation, the foundation of MX3, JCI Philippines, Rotary Club, to name a few.\nAddressing the gap between the grassroots communities in the Philippines and the local healthcare system enabled SMFI to impact Filipinos through quality medical attention and encourage them to prioritize their health.\nThe SM Foundation Medical Mission team The SM Foundation is also dedicated to bringing the best services and equipment in their medical services, ensuring readiness to meet the evolving demands of the health and medical landscape.\nThe SM Foundation mobile clinic has served around 1.4 million patients, and still counting, since its inception in 2001.\nThe deployment of a mobile clinic alongside the medical mission enhances its capacity to deliver comprehensive and high-quality healthcare services.",
