  "text": "Jailed Indian Navy Personnel Not To Be Hanged In Qatar; Death Sentenced Reduced To Prison Term\nThe death sentence of the eight former Indian Navy personnel has been reduced by Qatar Court on Thursday, said MEA, adding that India will continue to take up the matter with Qatari authorities.\nFollowing the verdict, the Ministry of External Affairs said that India has stood by them since the beginning of the matter and we will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance.\n“We have noted the verdict today of the Court of Appeal of Qatar in the Dahra Global case, in which the sentences have been reduced…The detailed judgement is awaited…Our Ambassador to Qatar and other officials were present in the Court of Appeal today, along with the family members. We have stood by them since the beginning of the matter and we will continue to extend all consular and legal assistance. We will also continue to take up the matter with the Qatari authorities,” said MEA in an official statement.\nALSO READ India Demands Extradition Of 26/11 Terror Attack Mastermind Hafiz Saeed From Pakistan\nImage\nThe eight former Indian Navy personnel were employees of Dahra Global, a Doha-based private defence services provider. They were arrested in August 2022 for espionage. India called the ruling deeply shocking and deployed all diplomatic channels to engage with Qatar on this case.\nCommander Purnendu Tiwari, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Amit Nagpal, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Captain Saurabh Vasisht and Sailor Ragesh Gopakumar were arrested in August 22.\nEarlier this month, MEA informed that two hearings have taken place in the case. “There have been two hearings. We filed an appeal, with the families, and the detainees had a final appeal. Two hearings have since been held. One was on November 30th and the other was on November 23rd. I think the next hearing is coming up soon,” Bagchi said.",
