  "text": "9 Dumbbell Arm Exercises to Strengthen Your Upper Body\nIf you're looking to get stronger in your upper body, dumbbell arm workouts are the way to go. You don't need access to tons of equipment and gym machines; with\na pair of dumbbells, a solid selection of dumbbell arm exercises, and a consistent routine (trainers recommend at least two strength training sessions per week), you'll be able to build muscle in your shoulders, triceps, and biceps. So what are some effective weighted arm exercises you should consider adding to your next workout? We asked the experts — aka certified personal trainers — and they answered, sharing nine of the best dumbbell exercises to strengthen your arms.\nPlease note: we don't recommend doing all these moves in one workout (your arms will not thank you for that). Instead, sprinkle a few throughout your weekly strength-training routine to really work your upper body. If you want to do a dedicated arm workout, start with an\nupper-body warmup and then pick four or five of these moves to do.\nIn terms of equipment, you'll just need two dumbbells. Feel free to pick up whatever weight feels appropriately challenging for you. If you're a beginner, you may want to start with three- or five-pounders and work your way up. (Here's a guide for\nchoosing the right weight.) Got your equipment? Keep reading for the best dumbbell arm exercises that'll be sure to get your muscles shaking.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Lateral Arm Raise\nThis dumbbell arm exercise doesn't work a ton of muscles but targets one that's often ignored. Lateral arm raises work your lateral deltoid (the muscle on the side of your shoulder), says\nSherika Holmes, NASM-certified personal trainer and owner of Sherika Fitness.\n- Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand so your palms face backwards.\n- With control, keep your arms straight (but not locked at the elbow) and raise both hands up and out in front of you. Keep your palms facing down stop when your arms are parallel to the floor. Then, bring your arms out to the sides, still raised. Keep your core engaged and back flat.\n- Slowly lower the weights to return to the starting position.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Plank Dumbbell Row\nThis exercise targets the triceps, but it can also help you build mid- and upper-back strength and stability, says\nKhaleah London, certified Pilates instructor and lead instructor for Equinox. \"While the exercise targets the triceps, you get the added benefit of working and strengthening almost every other major muscle group in your body,\" she tells POPSUGAR.\n- Start on your hands and knees, shoulders directly over wrists and hips over knees, holding a dumbbell against the ground in each hand. Brace your core and extend your legs behind you, tucking your toes under to lift your knees off the ground and spreading your feet wider than shoulder-width apart. This is your starting position.\n- Engage your core and squeeze your glutes as you lift the right dumbbell off the ground, pulling it toward your right hip. Make sure your right elbow is pointing up and your hips stay square to the floor.\n- Lower the weight to the ground with control, bracing your core and glutes. Try not to rock your shoulders or hips from side to side. Repeat on the other side.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Dumbbell Bench Press\n\"Not only is this exercise good for building up your chest, but it also recruits the muscles of your arms and shoulders,\" says Caley Crawford, NASM-certified personal trainer and director of education for\nRow House. She described the bench press as a dynamic move that works your muscles together, helping you build strength and coordination throughout your upper body.\n- Sit on a flat workout bench with one leg on either side. With one dumbbell in each hand resting on your thighs, lie back onto the bench. (If you don't have a bench, use a stability ball, as show, or lie flat on the ground with your legs bent and feet flat on the floor.)\n- Hold the dumbbells above your chest, shoulder-width apart, creating a 90-degree angle between your upper arm and forearm. Your palms should be facing forward. Press your back against the bench and engage your core.\n- Exhale as you push the dumbbells up, fully extending your arms so the weights come to a stop above your shoulders. Hold for one second.\n- Inhale and lower the dumbbells to the sides of your chest with control.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Overhead Triceps Extension\n\"This is an excellent dumbbell exercise to isolate the triceps,\" the muscles on the back of your upper arm, says Crawford. Overhead triceps extensions (seated or standing), she said, \"allow for a solid range of motion which really challenges the totality of your triceps.\"\n- Sit or stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding the center of one dumbbell in both hands behind your head, with your elbows bent and pointing toward the ceiling.\n- Engage your core so your back doesn't arch, and lift the dumbbell straight up toward the ceiling, bringing over your head.\n- Hold for one second, then slowly bend your arms to lower the weight behind your head.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Curl With Lunge\nThe curl with a lunge is a favorite among the pros — and for good reason. It works your biceps, core, and glutes, among other things. Plus, it's a combo of two classic and effective exercises you probably already know.\n- Stand with your feet and knees slightly apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Let the dumbbells rest by your sides.\n- Keep\nyour core engagedas you bend your elbows, bringing the weights to your shoulders.\n- Lower your arms down toward the floor, taking a large step with your left foot to the left and into a lunge.\n- Repeat on the right side for 1 rep.\n- Continue lunging for 30 seconds, alternating on your left and right sides.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Triceps Kickback\n\"This is one of my favorite movements for isolating the triceps,\" says ACE-certified personal trainer Tami Smith, who owns\nFit Healthy Momma. \"I recommend these often because the triceps play an integral role in so many of our movements, both in daily life and our workouts.\"\n- Start standing with your feet hip-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Hinge at the hips about 45 degrees, keeping your knees slightly bent and core engaged. Bent your elbows so they form a 90-degree angle, with your palms facing each other. This is the starting position.\n- Straighten your arms behind you with your palms facing in. Initiate the movement from your elbows, keeping your upper arms as still as possible and tight to your sides. Stop when your arms are parallel to the floor.\n- Squeeze your triceps, then bend your elbows to return to the starting position.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 10-12 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Single-Arm Overhead Shoulder Press\nThe overhead shoulder press \"works all three parts of the shoulder: the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid,\" says ACE-certified trainer Lacey Stone. Similar to the traditional overhead shoulder press, this one-arm variation lets you focus on one side at a time. Holmes loves it \"because it's multifunctional,\" she says. \"Not only does it increase strength in your shoulders, but it also increases core strength,\" especially your anterior core and your obliques along your sides.\n- Start standing with your feet hip-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand, racked above your shoulders, palms facing in. This is your starting position.\n- Straighten your right arm to press the weight directly up, keeping your left hand in place. Keep a slight bend in your elbows at the top, ensuring that the weight is directly over your shoulder, and keep your core engaged.\n- Bend your right elbow to lower the dumbbell and return to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Lawn Mower\nAs a\ncompound exercise, the lawn mower requires multi-joint movement that looks simple, but targets a whole host of muscles, including your back, arms, shoulders, and core.\n- With a dumbbell in your left hand and your right arm bent with the right hand in a fist (about shoulder height), squat, bringing the weight toward the floor.\n- Pull your abs to your spine as you straighten your legs, and pull your left elbow up, bringing the weight to your chest while your right arm extends straight.\n- Then contract your right arm, bend your knees and squat returning the weight back toward the floor returning to the starting position. That's 1 rep.\n- Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.\nDumbbell Arm Exercises: Single-Arm Row\nThis move, recommended by Roger Montenegro, NSCA-CSCS\n, is a great one for your upper body and the muscles that help stabilize your back.\n- Stand with your feet staggered, right foot in front, bent into a lunge. Hold a dumbbell in your left hand, and rest your right hand or elbow on your right thigh. Extend your left arm so the dumbbell hangs directly below your left shoulder. This is your starting position.\n- Keeping your core engaged and shoulders relaxed, row the dumbbell up to your left rib, keeping your arm in close to your torso.\n- Hold for a second, then lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position. Try not to rotate your shoulders during any part of the movement.\n- That's one rep. Try 2-3 sets of 8-10 reps, then switch sides and repeat.\nMaggie Ryan was an assistant editor at POPSUGAR.
