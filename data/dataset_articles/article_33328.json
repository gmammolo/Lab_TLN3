  "text": "QMS Medicosmetics, celebrated for its science-based skincare innovations, is joining forces with the prestigious Four Seasons Hotel London at Ten Trinity Square in an exciting collaboration set to debut in April 2024. This limited-time offering will be featured at the hotel’s acclaimed Spa, introducing the opulent and effective Collagen Sculpt and Define Facial. Crafted with the latest in scientific research and holistic health principles, this treatment is designed to rejuvenate the skin, targeting areas susceptible to ageing with diminished elasticity. The facial combines a fascia-release and sculpting massage with a transformative collagen-boosting mask to enhance facial firmness. It includes an arm exfoliation and nourishment procedure, extending its rejuvenating effects to the upper body. Originating over 35 years ago in Germany by the respected aesthetic and cosmetic surgeon Dr. Erich Schulte, QMS Medicosmetics has been at the forefront of skincare innovation, initially focusing on post-surgery scar healing improvements. Dr. Schulte’s revolutionary collagen complex, which combines collagen and hyaluronic acid, has significantly advanced skin elasticity and appearance, establishing QMS Medicosmetics as a leader in skincare breakthroughs. “We are thrilled to bring QMS Medicosmetics’ groundbreaking skincare expertise to the esteemed Four Seasons Ten Trinity Square. The tranquillity of the spa complements the dynamic approach to wellness at QMS Mediscosmetics. Our collaboration represents a fusion of cutting-edge science and holistic wellness principles, offering clients the opportunity to experience transformative skincare treatments that deliver visible results,” says Rowan Hall–Farrise, Brand Innovator and Trainer at QMS.
