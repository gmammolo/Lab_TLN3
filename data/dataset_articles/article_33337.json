  "text": "DECATUR, Ga. — Agnes Scott College has secured a substantial boost for its healthcare education initiatives, receiving $1 million in federal funding to help train physician assistants and mental health counselors. This funding comes as part of the 2024 omnibus appropriations bill, signed into law by President Biden on March 23. “This legislation makes strong investments that will lower childcare costs, support small businesses, strengthen rural health care and more,” said Senator Warnock, speaking about the Appropriations Act. “I’m proud it reflects my commitment to serving Georgians from Rome to Valdosta.” With this support, Agnes Scott College aims to prepare more than 160 master's students annually for careers as licensed professional counselors and certified physician assistants by 2027. \"We are immensely grateful to Senators Ossoff and Warnock for their support of our work to educate healthcare professionals, especially those who can make a difference in the lives of women and children,\" said Leocadia I. Zak, president of Agnes Scott College. The grant is specifically allocated to improve equipment, curriculum development, and technological resources required for the college's physician assistant and clinical mental health counseling graduate programs. The College introduced a clinical mental health counseling program in 2022 and plans to establish a physician assistant program in 2025.",
