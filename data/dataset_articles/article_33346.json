  "text": "Key Takeaways - The Lucid Air is now available with discounts of up to nearly $30,000. - This includes a new $5,000 discount through the end of the month on all trim levels. - Financing is also available with a rate of 2.99% for 72 months. The Lucid Air is a luxury EV with a starting price of $69,900, putting it well out of reach for those with a more modest budget. A series of available discounts can take nearly $30,000 off that price to make it easier to park one in your driveway. Now through the end of April, the full Lucid Air lineup is available with a $5,000 discount. This is only for vehicles that are in stock, so you can't custom order one and get the offer. You can, however, stack that discount on top of other discounts to save yourself nearly $30,000. The Best Discounts Are Always In California Those living in Los Angeles have access to a $15,000 Air Credit on Grand Touring models. They can also take advantage of a $9,650 Pro Credit. Including Lucid's discount, that adds up to a total of $29,650 in savings and is available whether you lease or buy an Air. Exactly how those credits apply is a little tricky as it's only available on models equipped with DreamDrive Pro and Surreal Sound Pro. The amounts also vary depending on the trim. On the Pure, it's a $12,500 Air Credit and a $2,900 Pro Credit that takes the total price down to $63,900 before the new $5,000 discount. Add in that final $5,000 discount and pricing comes all the way down to $58,900. Several EV Discounts Available Lucid is also offering great financing with rates as low as 2.99% for a 72-month loan. This doesn't exactly make the Lucid Air cheap, but it does make it far more affordable. It's also not the only electric vehicle that is trying to attract more buyers through lower pricing. The slowdown in EV sales growth has car companies scrambling to adjust prices with big discounts on many all-electric models, including the Ford Mustang Mach-E . As automakers focus on hybrids, which are seeing increased demand, we predict many more discounts to help dealers from all sorts of brands shift existing EV inventory.",
