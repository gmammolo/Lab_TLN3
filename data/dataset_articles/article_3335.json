  "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies have been on fire since the return of their star point guard, Ja Morant, after serving a 25-game suspension. With Morant back in action, the team has gone undefeated, winning all four games. This winning streak is in stark contrast to their 6-9 record without Morant at the start of the season. The Grizzlies' recent come-from-behind victory against the New Orleans Pelicans showcased Morant's impact on the court and his ability to lead his team to victory. During the game, Morant did a dance [celebration](https://www.vladtv.com/article/302636/ja-morant-pulls-out-gun-celebration-after-game-clinching-dunk-against) called \"pistols and bazooka,\" which many incorrectly associated with firearms. While discussing the situation, Gilbert Arenas told Shannon Sharpe it is actually a New Orleans dance, a cultural expression common among NBA players like Russell Westbrook. This dance is a form of joy and celebration, not aggression or anger. The confusion arises from the optics, as people tend to associate any form of gun-related gestures negatively. They also spoke about Morant's return profoundly impacting the team. The Grizzlies were struggling without him, highlighting his importance on the court. With his leadership, the team has quickly turned things around, currently enjoying an undefeated streak. This performance solidifies Morant's status as one of the future stars of the NBA and a player who can be marketed effectively to the Grizzlies' audience. To hear more, including Gilbert speaking about Morant being \"Ja Wick,\" hit the above video. Source: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TuxCdSgaxg)",
