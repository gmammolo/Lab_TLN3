  "text": "On Thursday, the Mercy Health Foundation received a $10,000 gift from the General Mills Foundation Hometown Grantmaking Program. The grant will help patients at Mercy Cancer Center with resources and services, including making sure they have adequate nutrition and transportation assistance to get to treatment services. “General Mills has once again demonstrated its commitment to making a positive impact on the well-being of communities,” Whit Sanders, director of radiation oncology for Mercy, said in a statement. “This generous gift from General Mills will have a direct and positive impact on the lives of those facing the hardships of cancer, providing them with the nutrition they need when navigating their treatment journey.” “General Mills continues to make a positive impact on the lives of those facing cancer,” said Miranda Lewis, vice president of the Mercy Health Foundation, in a statement. “This supports those navigating the challenging path of cancer, reminding them that they are not alone in their journey.” Since 2019, the Mercy Health Foundation has received more than $37,000 in support from the General Mills Foundation. General Mills, based in Minnesota, operates a frozen dough plant in Joplin at 3007 Stephens Blvd. that, with a recent expansion, is expected to employ 575 people. It also acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products in 2018 in an $8 billion deal, including Blue Buffalo’s Heartland Pet Food Manufacturing plant in the Crossroads Center Business and Distribution Park on East 32nd Street (Route FF) in Joplin. According to the company, that plant employed 287 people last year.",
