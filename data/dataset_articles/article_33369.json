  "text": "Do you consider yourself to be an optimist? We got to thinking about this recently when we received a message from a lifelong friend. He talked about all the blessings in his life, in fact, his words were overflowing about living life abundantly. All this in spite of the fact that his wife has dementia, and he has started taking drugs for a newly discovered cancer. How is it that some people are able to maintain a positive outlook, even in the midst of serious, negative things happening in their lives? Let’s explore what optimism is and why it’s such a powerful force in life.\nStudies show that optimists typically are happier, healthier, and more successful in life. While it's easy to be brought down by negativity in today's world, maintaining an optimistic outlook has been shown to provide tremendous benefits across all areas of life. As the Dalai Lama once said, \"Choose to be optimistic, it feels better.\" With some conscious effort to cultivate positive thinking, you can tap into the incredible power of optimism.",
