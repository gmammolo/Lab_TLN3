  "text": "Regional West Medical Center will host an open house Sunday, April 14 to celebrate its 100th anniversary. The public is invited to attend from 2 to 5 p.m. in the Regional West Education Center, located at 4021 Ave. B, Scottsbluff. There will be a short program at 2 p.m. The first 100 attendees will receive a commemorative keepsake. Refreshments will be served. Throughout 2024, Regional West is celebrating the 100th anniversary of caring for the people of western Nebraska and the neighboring states of Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming. On April 15, 1924, the West Nebraska Methodist Episcopal Hospital opened at the corner of 18th and Broadway in Scottsbluff with a staff of 25. During the last 100 years, much has changed on its campus, in the community, and in the region. Regional West Medical Center is now a regional referral center and the state’s only Level II Trauma Center west of Kearney. At its roots, Regional West has always been a community hospital — paid for by the community, supervised by a volunteer board of local citizens, and improved by contributions from volunteers and friends who continue to donate their time and talent in order to provide quality health care for the future. People are also reading… No organization reaches 100 years without challenges. But with challenge comes opportunity, and Regional West Medical Center is excited about the many positive things that are happening at Regional West. Throughout the decades, Regional West Medical Center name and location have changed along with medical technology, and its staff and services have grown dramatically, yet Regional West Medical Center is committed to provide the same excellent care upon which it built its reputation. While much has changed since 1924, the dedication of Regional West Medical Center physicians, providers, employees, and countless others remains the same, and will continue as Regional West Medical Center embarks on the next 100 years.",
