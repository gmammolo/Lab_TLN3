  "text": "Josh Gravette named executive director of Nir Family YMCA branch WILMINGTON, N.C. (WECT) - Josh Gravette has been named the new executive director of the Nir Family YMCA on Market Street, per a YMCA announcement on Thursday, April 4. He was previously executive director at Southside Virginia Family YMCA for the past five years, overseeing donations and funding allocations. “Fiscal management and making sure we are using our dollars to have the best impact is a huge part of what we do at the Y — whether it be ordering the correct machines, making better use of space, or growing our programs,” said Gravette. “Being able to analyze how we can best support our members and community is important.” Gravette is from Virginia and has a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Virginia and a master’s degree in human genetics from Tulane University. After working in food testing, he shifted careers to work as a lifeguard at the YMCA of Central Virginia. “It did not take long for Gravette to fall in love with the Y’s mission and, within just a few years, he expanded his role to include bus transportation. He picked up students from school, took them to swim lessons, served them healthy snacks, and dropped them off at home. Gravette knew he was making a meaningful difference in the lives of these children and enjoyed watching them gain confidence around the water,” a YMCA announcement states. He later became aquatics director and created a second-grade swim lesson program and a water safety curriculum to fight drowning deaths. “With every position, I give it my all,” said Gravette. “I’d love to be able to look back and know that we did everything we could, that our team pushed, to serve this community, impact more youth, and grow our programs.” Copyright 2024 WECT.
