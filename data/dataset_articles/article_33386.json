  "text": "Department of Public Health, downtown business partner to feed those in need AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - Toaste of Augusta on Broad Street operates mainly as a brunch spot downtown, but owner Dominick Cantrel has always looked to do more. That’s why they’re partnering to serve free food with the Department of Public Health on the last business day of the month for the next two years. “Whoever needs to help what we’re gonna do we’re gonna do what we got to do to help,” said Cantrel. Cantrel also provides a service called “God’s Grits,” where every month he opens his restaurant up to whoever needs a plate of food at no cost and no questions asked. “My mom always told me if I have the means to help someone, do it without asking for anything in advance or asking anything in return, and I live on it. So I feel like there’s more people that need my help and I’m more than willing to help,” he said. Through “God’s Grits”, he serves 50 to 75 people monthly. During the first event with the Department of Public Health, he served more than 250 people. “I was a little overwhelmed because I didn’t know that it was just that many folks that needed assistance. I mean, you think you know, but you don’t know,” he said. “That’s probably just barely touching the surface.” With Project Refresh on the last business day of every month, Cantrel will be ready to serve those who need it. “How many more folks that are too afraid to come to you and say, ‘Hey, I need help.’ You know, this is an open event to the community,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what your situation is, you’re more than welcome. It touched my heart, I’ll be honest with you. I’ve definitely got a warm, fuzzy space in my heart for it.” Cantrel also says that combining forces with the Department of Public Health, allows more people to know about “God’s Grits”.
