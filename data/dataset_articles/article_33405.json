  "text": "2024-04-04 21:33:01\nThis year, the theme of\nWorld Health Day is “My health, my right.” Without a doubt, elected to defend that all people have access to quality health services, education and information, among others. Thus, and with the intention of enhancing the growing trend of physical and mental care for all people: awareness about stress and its consequences on health is becoming more and more relevant.\nAccording to the Global Wellness Institute (GWI), the global wellness\neconomy is worth $4.4 trillion and is projected to reach $7 trillion by 2025. These figures are not surprising, as people look for options to prioritize their health, this is because 48% of Latin Americans feel stressed daily in their work environment, according to Health on Demand 2023, a report launched by the consultancy Marsh McLennan. Furthermore, within the top 10 countries with the highest levels of stress in the region is Peru in third place and Colombia in eighth, according to The State of Work 2023 from the Gallup consultancy. Against this backdrop, Palladium Hotel Group joins the cause and shares three activities to counteract stress, prioritize rest and achieve well-being of body and mind.\nRestorative massages\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, massages or massage therapy are an auxiliary to comprehensive medicine, which is why they provide multiple benefits for those who receive them, including: stress reduction, reduction of pain in any mild or serious condition, elimination of muscle tension, strengthening the immune system, relaxation, among others.\nAmong the many options are Swedish massages, one of the most used techniques to balance the body naturally, with soft or strong movements throughout the body, but always in the opposite direction of blood circulation. According to the European Parasanitary School, these types of techniques reduce joint pain, promote the elimination of toxins, in addition to helping blood circulation.\nMost spas usually offer hydrotherapy circuits, this technique consists of performing movements or activities within an aquatic environment, be it a pool or a jacuzzi. In fact, according to TELETON USA, hydrotherapy helps in increasing strength, improving awareness, improving mobility, as well as increasing balance and promoting better blood circulation.\nPalladium Hotel Group’s wellness centres, Zentropia Palladium Spa & Wellness, feature all of the above options and are located at Grand Palladium Hotels & Resorts, TRS Hotels and Family Selection at Grand Palladium Hotels & Resorts. Specifically, Punta Cana, Cap Cana, Riviera Maya, Costa Mujeres, Vallarta and even Ibiza are some of the destinations where guests can live an unparalleled experience.\nWith modern facilities that include a jacuzzi, sauna, professional massages, facials and even vegan treatments that are performed with views of the Caribbean, the Palladium Hotel Group spas are a relaxing oasis with dream locations set with interior design designed in accordance with the local culture. , as well as personalized attention to de-stress in the middle of nature.\nNatural landscapes\nThe ocean has been shown to have multiple\nhealth benefits. For example, the book by marine biologist, Wallace J. Nichols entitled Blue Mind, highlights the properties that seawater has on people; from helping relaxation, reducing stress and promoting reflection. Furthermore, in the physical sphere, research from the Japan School of Medicine revealed that salt in seawater is an ally in curing dermatological conditions.\nThat is why taking vacations in a beach destination can be a great option, especially if you reserve in places specifically focused on well-being, such is the case of Mexico and the Dominican Republic, places that occupy the first positions in Latin America with options for practice wellness tourism in Caribbean regions. In addition, activities such as Sunrise Yoga with sea views certainly make a difference, or the water sports offered at Palladium Hotel Group resorts, such as Kayaking or enjoying sailing with a HobbieCat.\nPractice sports\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, exercise, in any form, can help relieve stress. So staying active can increase levels of feel-good endorphins and distract you from your daily worries.\nIn this sense, the Zentropia Palladium Spa & Wellness centers have a gym equipped with the latest equipment, a beauty salon, a facial service, as well as other treatments, which complement the offer for a comprehensive trip in which well-being is protagonist. In addition to this, this sports and fitness offer can be completed with sports practices such as mini-golf, tennis, paddle tennis, pickleball or the fantastic training clinics at the Rafael Nadal Tennis Center in Costa Mujeres, and other activities more focused on well-being such as stretching. sunrise or yoga classes with sea views.\nBoth TRS Hotels, Family Selection at Grand Palladium Hotels & Resorts and Gran Palladium Hotels & Resort allow moments that promote\nhealth and relaxation, to achieve the well-being of the entire family, with a varied range of services in dream destinations.\n1712268637\n#Activities #Leave #Stress #Prioritize #Wellbeing #areacucuta.com\nRelated posts:\nRecommendations for travelers 2023 - Health on the Net Swedish feminists oppose gender self-determination law Watch ..
