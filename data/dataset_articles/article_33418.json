  "text": "Study results provide new understanding of how mammalian hosts defend against pathogenic organisms, as well as implications for better treating Salmonella Researchers at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/) have discovered a mechanism by which a bacterial virus undermines the virulence of Salmonella, allowing the host a chance to rehabilitate. In a study [published today in Science](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adl3222), researchers identify a new way by which a bacterial virus limits the capacity of Salmonella to cause infection. The terminase protein within the bacterial Gifsy-1 prophage, or virus, is normally involved in genomic processing of viral DNA. However, upon oxidative stress the terminase acquires the ability to break down transfer RNA (tRNA), ultimately compromising protein synthesis in Salmonella, a common cause of diarrhea in humans. \"We have discovered that a virus encoded in the Salmonella genome acts as the Achille's heel of this common human pathogen,\" says Andres Vazquez-Torres, PhD, professor of immunology and microbiology at the [University of Colorado School of Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/). \"This basic research can possibly provide a basis for exploring ways to treat Salmonella infections in humans,\" says Vazquez-Torres. \"This new understanding can be exploited for our advantage - for example, we could benefit from the toxin produced by an endogenous virus to potentially treat patients with Salmonella infections that are resistant to antibiotics.\" [here](/new-method-found-to-curb-salmonella-bacterial-1209202/).",
