  "text": "Key Takeaways Novartis on Thursday said it will seek label expansion of its prostate cancer treatment, Pluvicto, following a successful Phase 3 study. The drug maker said Pluvicto helped improve survival rates when patients received it prior to certain chemotherapies. Novartis explained that it planned to seek approval to expand Pluvicto's use in the second half of 2024. Novartis shares were up more than 2% in late trading Thursday. Shares of Novartis ( NVS ) climbed Thursday as the pharmaceutical firm announced it would seek approval for expanded use of its cancer treatment, Pluvicto.\nThe Swiss-based firm reported that a late-stage trial found that Pluvicto helped improve overall survival rates for patients with advanced prostate cancer when it was given before they received chemotherapy drugs known as taxanes.\nPluvicto is a radiotherapy that, as originally approved in 2022, uses both a compound that targets cells and a therapeutic radioactive particle, and is given to those whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Pluvicto was the fastest-growing drug for Novartis in 2023, with sales soaring 262% to $980 million.\nNovartis said it would file for label expansion of Pluvicto in the second half of the year. The company added that full results of the study would be presented at a future medical meeting.\nNovartis shares were up 2.4% at $96.61 at around 3:35 p.m. ET Thursday.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?
