  "text": "Struggling to get comfortable at night ? If you find yourself tossing and turning, you might benefit from a body pillow. Designed for cuddling, these extra-long cushions let your muscles relax while keeping your body in proper alignment. Unlike snuggling with your partner, body pillows don’t disturb you with their own movement, noises, or heat — or crush your arm under their weight until it goes numb!\nFor anyone who often wakes up sore, body pillows might be the answer. Side sleepers with back issues, for example, can place a body pillow between their knees and hug it; this helps keep their weight evenly distributed and takes pressure off the hips. This is also a bonus for pregnant people who need to redistribute the weight from their growing baby bellies.\nBest Body Pillows on Amazon At a Glance Best Body Pillow on Amazon Overall: Utopia Bedding Full Body Pillow , $20\nBest Memory Foam: WhatsBedding Memory Foam Body Pillow , $25\nBest Long-Lasting Body Pillow: EnerPlex Body Pillow , $23\nBest Splurge: Snuggle-Pedic Shredded Memory Foam Body Pillow , $50\nBest for Healthy Body Alignment: Coop Home Goods The Original Body Pillow , $99\nBest Value: Cosybay Soft Large Body Pillow Insert & Pillowcase , $25\nBest Multi-Positional: Soft-Tex SofLOFT Body Pillow , $20\nPlus, we all know hugs are comforting, right?

Most also let you add or remove fill to customize it to your preference. It’s also important to make sure that the cover is in a feel-good fabric for the best snuggles.
