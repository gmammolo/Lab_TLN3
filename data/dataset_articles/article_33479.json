  "text": "Food First NL says they are excited about news that the federal government is putting $1-billion toward a national school food program over the next five years.\nThe program, announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\nearlier this week, is expected to provide healthy lunches to an additional 400,000 school-aged children across Canada every year.\nProgram coordinator and lead for school food Ashley Byrne says the program has been a long time coming, noting that Canada was the only G7 country without such a program in place.\nByrne explains that there is now support at both the federal and provincial levels of government for school food in the province.\nAs Byrne explains, a quarter of children across the province live in food insecure households.\nShe says school meals are not yet universally available here, especially in rural and remote communities. She describes a “patchwork” system involving many different programs and styles, so for children living with food insecurity the national program is a big deal.",
