  "text": "Benefits of therapy sessions with dogs ROCKFORD, Ill. (WIFR) - Bettering the mental health of patients, therapy dogs can play a key role in providing comfort for a multitude of different health challenges. Some patients diagnosed with ADHD, PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder and Alzheimer’s disease can benefit from the presence of a therapy dog or companion animal. April 11 is Dog Therapy Appreciation Day, celebrating the hard work put forth by dogs since the first therapy dog program was established in 1976. Thomas Shook is the founder of [815 Paws](https://www.815paws.org/), a therapy dog organization based in Rockford. Shook says traditional forms of therapy can be beneficial, but dog therapy helps patients feel calmer. “A lot of times, the dogs will pick up on something going on with the client before the actual therapist will,” Shook said. “When you add the dog, like Mya, laying on the ground, she would actually get up and maybe go over to the client.” Copyright 2024 WIFR.
