  "text": "The “Delicious” Limited-Edition $3 Trader Joe’s Treat That People Are Clearing Off the Shelves independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing. Who doesn’t love a Trader Joe’s frozen food find ? From their delicious and simple dinners to their clever sweet treats, the Trader Joe’s frozen food section is stocked with all kinds of scrumptious eats that shoppers can’t get enough of. The discount grocer is always stocking their freezers with new seasonal treats, and it seems there is a new favorite that shoppers are already raving about: the Trader Joe’s Brown Sugar Boba Mochi . Sold for just $2.99, the Brown Sugar Boba Mochi are individually-wrapped mochi balls made with soft and chewy rice cakes, then stuffed with a boba pearl center. They are gluten-free and come with twelve mochi balls, with two balls equivalent to one serving. In their description, Trader Joe’s says that this sweet treat is a “callback to the beloved boba shop classic” with all of the taste of a sweet boba tea without the straw. In a review of this product, Natasha Fischer from @traderjoeslist on Instagram says she was surprised that despite the brown sugar flavor of this dessert, the mochi isn’t as sweet as she thought it would be. “I really like this because it’s not too sweet. It definitely has a lot of chewy mochi [texture]… I was expecting more of a gooey boba pearl center.” Trader Joe’s shoppers have taken to social media to share how much they love this new cheap sweet treat, commenting on how they’ve “been influenced” to go to their local TJ’s and get a bag themselves. One TikToker even comments on how the taste of the Brown Sugar Boba Mochi tastes similar to the Trader Joe’s Non-Dairy Brown Sugar Oat Creamer. Although it is unclear how long this new Trader Joe’s dessert will be on shelves, it might be worth snagging a bag if you see one; with all of this hype online, we have a feeling this will be another TJ’s gem that is going to sell out fast.",
