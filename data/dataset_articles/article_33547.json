  "text": "Ignited by sweeping the three relays and claiming two handfuls of individual wins, W.F. West dominated the girls side of a five-team league meet last week in Shelton with 11 total victories, more than the rest of the field. Lauren Kelley was the star for the Bearcats, securing the open 200 in 28.1 seconds, just clipping Adna’s Megan Price. Kelley anchored the victorious 400 and 800 relays and kicked off the 1,600 relay that capped the night with a 13-second win. Julia Dalan, Amanda Bennett and Trinity Gist teamed with Kelley on the two faster relays while Ashlen Gruginski, Emily Mallonee and Joy Cushman completed the foursome on the last relay of the meet. Nearly all of them had an individual event win. Dalan secured the open 100 in 14.4 seconds, Bennett continued her stellar start in the javelin with a winning heave of 108 feet, 10 inches while Cushman (400), Gruginski (800) and Mallonee (300 hurdles) crossed the finish line first. Berkeley Varick (3,200) and Mercedes Ricks (pole vault) also had wins for the Bearcats. Dalan snared second in the javelin. Adna picked up wins in two of the throwing events as Lillian Boyd won the shot put with a toss of 33-08 and Karsyn Freeman threw the discus over 109 feet to edge past Boyd. Black Hills’ high jump tandem of Lilly Kincaid and Lia Crecelius each cleared 4-4 in the high jump, tying or first. On the boys side, W.F. West’s Hayden Niemi and Lucas Hoff each won two events. Niemi darted 44.9 seconds to win the 300 hurdles and unleashed a throw of 135-01 to claim the javelin, plus he finished second in the 110 hurdles. Hoff won the high jump and pole vault, clearing the bars at 5-10 and 12-06, respectively. Trenton Schoepf leaped 35-06 to claim the triple jump while the Bearcats’ 400 relay dashed around the track in 46.3 seconds. Adna’s Jordan Stout coasted in the 3,200 while Tyler Price placed runner-up in the open 100 and 200. Cohen Hartley (400), Bailey Davis (1600) and Gavan Muller (300 hurdles) also were in second for the Pirates. Black Hills’ Ezra Harris was the runner-up in the javelin.",
