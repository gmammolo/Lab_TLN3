(firmenpresse) - If your time serving America in the United States Army has left you hard of hearing, Nano Hearing Aids wants to help. If you don’t know where to begin when it comes to hearing aids and devices, they are committed to making things clear. Go to https://nanohearingaids.com/ to see how they can help you get your hearing back. The Challenges Faced By VeteransThe team at Nano Hearing Aids appreciates that, as a veteran, you have a unique set of circumstances that may be impacting both the way you access medical care and your financial standing. Nano also appreciates that as well as other challenging injuries and disabilities, hearing loss and tinnitus are two of the most common physical injuries endured by veterans. If you’re suffering from hearing issues, Nano reassures you that millions of other veterans are in the same boat. OTC Hearing Aids Just For YouIf you are suffering from perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, they want to give you the information you need to start understanding which hearing aids might be best for you. If you are on a tight budget and are struggling to pay for your other healthcare and daily needs, they recommend their OTC models, which are ideal for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Nano Hearing Aids believes that their OTC models, which you can buy without the need for medical intervention, can help you if you feel disenchanted with the system or you don’t want to rely on slow and cumbersome disability support. Invisible CIC & BTE OptionsAll of their models are invisible—which Nano has seen is particularly preferred by veterans like you—with both completely in canal (CIC) or subtle and hidden behind the ear (BTE) options available. Their base level aids start from $297 RRP and offer you up to 12 hours of battery life per charge, a small portable charging battery case, and two listening programs. More advanced models give you extra features like: Bluetooth connectivity for in-app controlmultidirectional microphonesand more listening modes. Picking The Right Hearing AidsIf you have perceived mild to moderate hearing loss, Nano Hearing Aids recommends you consult their new online guide to see whether OTC aids are right for you, and to learn more about the benefits of this type of technology. Their spokesperson said, “If you have been disconnected from the fullness of sound for a while, it can also be an adjustment. Therefore, an amazing customer support team, we believe, is as important as world-class research and development. With no sales pressure. We’re here when you’re ready, whatever that looks like. Small hinges can, indeed, open big doors.” Let Nano help you get your hearing back at https://nanohearingaids.com/ Themen in dieser Pressemitteilung: Unternehmensinformation / Kurzprofil: Hearing At Home LLC Hearing At Home LLC https://hearingathome.com/ ab(at)clearviewcom.com +1 (404) 822-3309 511 South Royal Lane Coppell United States Datum: 05.04.2024 - 00:40 Uhr Sprache: Deutsch News-ID 703217 Anzahl Zeichen: 2969 contact information: Contact person: Media Inquiries Town: [Coppell](https://www.firmenpresse.de/presseportal/coppell.html) Phone: +1 (404) 822-3309 Kategorie: Typ of Press Release: Unternehmensinformation type of sending: Veröffentlichung Date of sending: 04/04/2024 Diese Pressemitteilung wurde bisher 65 mal aufgerufen.
