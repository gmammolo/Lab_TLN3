  "text": "Ben’s BBQ to benefit Alzheimer’s Association The annual event will take place in Nolensville. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - When Erin and Josh Drummond first hosted Ben’s BBQ, it was a way to honor the memory of Erin’s beloved father, Ben McCloud, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2018 and passed in 2020. McCloud was an avid golfer, cook, and philanthropist, and the most loving father and grandfather, his family said. For Josh and Erin Drummond, hosting this family-friendly event with proceeds to benefit the Alzheimer’s Association TN Chapter became a “family affair.” Josh joined the Alzheimer’s Association TN Chapter Board of Directors a few years ago to raise awareness and support the mission. Erin became the facilitator of an Alzheimer’s support group for caregivers under 40 years old. This year’s event will feature a special “tasting” smorgasbord. Several local restaurants will be featured at the BBQ, serving tastings of their food, including Corky’s BBQ and Bar-b-Cutie. There will also be popcorn from Kettle Corn Classic, cotton candy from Pandy Cotton Candy, and more. The event will also feature live music from the 90s cover band, “Happy Accidents.” This family-friendly event includes kids’ activities such as a bounce house, face painting by Fantasy Face Artistry (Dan Klepper), board breaking from Master Bae’s Taekwondo, customizable stuffed animals from Teddy Bear Mobile and yard games. A classic and custom car show will also be included in the event. There will be an onsite silent auction, including autographed guitars from Morgan Wallen and Hardy as well as items from many local businesses. The event will happen on Sunday, April 7, from 2 to 5 p.m. at Mill Creek Brewing in Nolensville. Tickets can be purchased by visiting [bensbbq.org](https://bensbbq.org/). Copyright 2024 WSMV.
