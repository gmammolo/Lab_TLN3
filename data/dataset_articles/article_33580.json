Proper hydration is crucial for balancing bodily fluids, eliminating toxins, and ensuring proper cellular function. Providing Antioxidant Protection: Antioxidant water supplies the body with antioxidants, which combat free radicals, preventing cell damage and delaying aging. Antioxidants also support immune system functions and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Boosting Energy Levels: Consuming alkaline water may increase energy levels by improving hydration and supporting cellular functions. This results in more energy and stamina for daily activities.
