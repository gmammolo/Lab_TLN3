  "text": "In a recently conducted phase 2 trial, which was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Sanofi's ( SNY ) lixisenatide was found to be effective in slowing down the progression of motor disability, which includes symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement in patients at an early stage of Parkinson's disease.\nThe drug developed by French drugmaker, Sanofi belongs to the class of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which is similar to the popular medications Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for obesity.\nThe study involved 156 individuals across France with early-stage Parkinson's disease who were randomly assigned to receive either lixisenatide from Sanofi or a placebo for one year. Participants continued their standard Parkinson's medication during the study, with one group receiving daily injections of Sanofi's drug and the other group receiving a placebo. Patients taking lixisenatide exhibited minimal progression of motor symptoms compared to those receiving the placebo, with the difference persisting two months after treatment cessation.\nHowever, the use of Sanofi's drug was linked to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea in nearly half of the patients and vomiting in 13% of participants.",
