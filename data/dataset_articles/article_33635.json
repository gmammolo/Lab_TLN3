  "text": "JACKSON COUNTY - Omnia Group Ashland and Heroic Hearts Project have teamed up to help bring free or reduced cost psilocybin experiences to our veterans. Drew Snyder is a veteran who was diagnosed with PTSD and said he's benefited from psilocybin treatment. Snyder experienced tremendous anxiety and stress. He said he was a wreck and pursued a lot of therapy. The VA provided options for treatment and provided medication to make him feel functional but as Snyder described it, “not the person I wanted to be for my family, for my wife and kids... I was a wreck.” Now he is a licensed counselor and a licensed psilocybin facilitator. Listen here for the full interview. Omnia and HHP will hold a fundraiser Saturday April 6, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Dr. Zach Skiles will be the keynote speaker starting at 5:45 p.m. The event will be held at 607 Siskiyou Blvd, Ashland OR 97520 The event invites residents to support the program and bring relief to veterans who served our country. It provides an opportunity for people to learn about the possibilities of psilocybin supported services for veterans.",
