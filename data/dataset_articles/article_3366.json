On the complaint of the girl's father, the police had registered a case of kidnapping against unknown persons.\" [ANI](/ani-stories)| Updated: 29-12-2023 17:42 IST | Created: 29-12-2023 17:42 IST - Country: - India The Mumbai police arrested two individuals for allegedly kidnapping a 17-year-old minor girl and forcing her into prostitution in West Bengal, said the police. According to police, the accused were identified as Kunal Pandey and Sikander Shaikh. Sharing details about the incident, Senior Officer of Dharavi Police Station Raju Bidkar said, \"The 17-year-old girl had gone missing from her home in Dharavi in September. On the complaint of the girl's father, the police had registered a case of kidnapping against unknown persons.\" After this, the police registered the case and continued their investigation. A few days ago the police received information about the girl that she was in Panjipara, West Bengal, after which the Dharavi police officers left for from Mumbai to West Bengal. Subsequently, police officials discovered that the minor had been forced into prostitution, after which the minor was rescued and reunited with her family in Mumbai.

After having solved this case, the Mumbai police in Dharavi registered a 100 per cent detection rate by managing to solve all the missing cases of children in 2023.
