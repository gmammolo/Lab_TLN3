  "text": "By The Health Standard Newswire ,\n1 day ago In this article, Dr. Shelandra Bell, Family Medicine, shares her expert insights of the findings and provides Texas residents with evidence-based recommendations for protecting their health.\nWhy This Matters to You New research is showing that eating more dietary fiber can help reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes by encouraging the growth of good gut bacteria and beneficial metabolites.\nWhat This Means for Your Health \"...mom continues to be correct. Eat your fiber!\" Dr. Puja Uppal, Family Medicine\nDoctor's Expert Insights About The Impact of Dietary Fiber and Gut Health Know this: \"For those looking to cut their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, eating more dietary fiber should be a good start. Fiber found in fruits, veggies, nuts, and whole grains doesn't just keep your digestive system running smoothly--it also feeds the good bacteria in your gut. These bacteria, in turn, produce helpful substances that our bodies can use.\" Dr. Shelandra Bell, Family Medicine.\nActionable Steps: What You Can Do Next\nKnow your A1c blood levels. Schedule a colonoscopy if you're 45 years and older--do it sooner if you have any family relatives who've had colon cancer in their past. The CDC has a comprehensive page about these new guidelines. ( Visit Here ) Most insurances in Texas will cover this colonoscopy. Health News Today: Fiber may reduce diabetes risk through its impact on gut bacteria and metabolites.\nThis new study investigates the complex relationships between dietary fiber intake, gut microbiota, circulating metabolites, and their potential roles in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a U.S. Hispanic/Latino population.\nThe Science Made Simple: Key Findings and What They Mean for Texas Residents Dietary fiber intake and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk: Eating more dietary fiber was linked to a lower risk of developing T2D over 6 years. They found that people who ate the more fiber had a 29% lower chance of getting T2D--when compared to those who ate the least fiber.\nDietary fiber intake, gut bacteria, and T2D: 24 types of gut bacteria were related to fiber intake, and 9 of these were also related to T2D. Some species of bacteria (Butyrivibrio, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Marvinbryantia) were found more in people who ate more fiber and less in people with T2D.\nDifferent bacteria (Acidaminococcus, Erysipelatoclostridium, Hungatella, and Lachnoclostridium) were found less in people who ate more fiber and more in people with T2D.\nSimply put, the study found that certain gut bacteria were affected by the amount of fiber people ate, and these bacteria were also related to whether someone had T2D or not.\nDietary fiber intake, gut bacterial enzymes, and T2D: Enzymes that break down fiber and were found more in people who ate more fiber were found less in people with T2D. Gut bacteria produce enzymes that help digest fiber, and the study found that these enzymes were affected by fiber intake and also related to T2D.\nCombining gut bacteria and blood metabolite data: 18 metabolites in the blood were found to be related to both fiber intake and T2D, and also to specific gut bacteria. The study found connections between specific bacteria, molecules, and T2D risk.\nBlood metabolites may explain links between gut bacteria and T2D: The relationships between some gut bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Butyrivibrio, Acidaminococcus, and Lachnoclostridium) and T2D became weaker when considering their related metabolites. The study suggests that certain gut bacteria may affect T2D risk through the molecules/byproducts they produce.\nPredicting T2D risk using gut bacteria and blood metabolites: Using blood metabolites as stand-ins for gut bacteria, the study suggested that Butyrivibrio and Lachnoclostridium bacteria might be related to increased T2D risk. By analyzing the relationships between gut bacteria and blood molecules, the study found clues that certain bacteria could help predict someone's risk of developing T2D in the future.\nConclusion: The study shows that eating more dietary fiber is linked to healthier gut bacteria, bacterial functions, and blood molecule profiles. All these components are related to a lower risk of T2D. Keep in mind this study looked at a U.S. Hispanic/Latino population--as such, broader studies will need to be conducted. In the short term, fiber's beneficial role in promoting a healthy diet is well-established.\nMedical News Today: What This Means for Your Health in Texas The Bottom Line: The findings help us better understand the complex relationships between dietary fiber, gut bacteria, and blood molecules, and how they may influence the development of T2D.\n\"Consistent evidence suggests diabetes-protective effects of dietary fiber intake, but exactly how that protection occurs remains unclear.\" Zheng Wang, PhD. (Study Editorial)\nWhat They're Saying: \"Our study revealed that Faecalibacterium was associated with multiple potentially beneficial metabolites in serum, including indolepropionate, 3-phenylpropionate, and cinnamoylglycine, all linked to higher fiber intake and lower risk of T2D. Our findings are consistent with the reported beneficial role of indolepropionate in antiinflammation, antioxidant activity, and amelioration of glucose metabolism.\" (Study Source)\nHealth Standard Newswire : Fiber Intake Shapes Beneficial Bacteria and Metabolites.\nHealth Facts That Matter: Key Statistics for Harris County, Texas The following health facts impact your physical health directly! Did you know there were 8136 deaths from diabetes in Texas in 2021? 37.7% of you in Harris County are obese. 18.4% of you in Harris County have depression. 33.7% of you in Harris County are sleeping less than 7 hours per night. All of these variables above play an important role in the outcomes of your overall health.\nThe Health Standard Newswire.\nExpand All Read in NewsBreak",
