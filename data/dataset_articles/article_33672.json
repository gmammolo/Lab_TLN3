The actor has now recovered.\nJamie Foxx, 56, is back to his former strength. Last year, the actor suffered a medical emergency and spent several months in the hospital. He has now recovered from his health problems. “He’s so busy and doing what he loves again,” says one Insider from “People Magazine ” about the “Django Unchained” actor.\nIn the coming season, the Hollywood star will return as host of the game show “Beat Shazam”. His daughter Corinne Foxx supports him. “Jamie didn’t bat an eye during ‘Beat Shazam’. He was literally his old self again. He was in a really good mood!” says the source about the filming.\nFoxx has returned to work\n“He is now working with full vigor, living healthy and enjoying his good health. Jamie is a sociable guy, he likes to be with his friends, he has to be busy with all sorts of things,” another source tells the magazine. The born entrepreneur is currently working on several films at the same time, including “Tin Soldier” and “Not Another Church Movie”.\nHealth problems remain unknown\nDetails about the medical emergency Foxx suffered in April 2023 are not known. “I didn’t want you to see me with tubes sticking out of me and wonder if I could do it,” he replied in an Instagram video three months later. He has been “through hell” in the last few weeks. The comedian wants to deal with this difficult time in an upcoming stand-up program.\nSpotOnNews\n#Subjects source site-16",
