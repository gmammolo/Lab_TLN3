  "text": "In Turkey, you can now get pulled over for speeding by a Bugatti.\nThe traffic department’s fleet just got stocked with some incredible luxury cars.\nSeeing a policeman driving a Porsche is one thing, learning how they got these cars is a whole other story.\nREAD MORE:\nWoman orders an Uber in Austria and gets picked up by epic supercar\nTurkey is giving the\nDubai Police fleet a run for its money.\nAli Yerlikaya, the country’s interior minister, made a\npost on X announcing several new additions to the traffic departments’ garage.\nThe Turkish Police Department led a massive raid where they impounded several sports cars, supercars and SUVs.\nThe luxury SUVs included a Range Rover Sport and a Mercedes-Benz GLS.\nA Ferrari 458 and a Bentley Continental were some of the more expensive cars they nabbed.\nThere were also some performance cars such as a Porsche Taycan and a Volkswagen Golf R.\nIn total, there were 23 cars, with a combined value of $3.5 million.\nThe vehicles came from one source: a drug trafficker called Hakan Ayik.\nOnce described as “Australia’s most wanted man”, Ayik has an estimated fortune of $1 billion.\nPolice arrested him and 36 of his cronies in Istanbul last month, and discovered their incredible car collection while doing so.\nAfter the vehicles were seized, the court decided to gift them back to the team that led the successful sting.\nNow every car has been transformed into a police cruiser.\n“From now on, these tools do not belong to criminal organizations,” Yerlikaya said.\n“It will be at the disposal of our police and at the service of our Nation!”\nThis puts Turkey up there with some of the coolest police fleets in the world.\nIn Qatar police cruise around in a\nLamborghini Urus.\nWhile the\nDubai Police Force has a Bentley Continental GT V8 in its luxury lineup.\nIt also has the Ghiath, an\nultra-futuristic car with 12 secret cameras and its own drone.",
