  "text": "CVS Health said its drug plans will cover the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. at zero cost for many health plan sponsors. That decision could open the door for more people to prevent unintended pregnancies without a prescription. The drug, known as Opill from Perrigo, was available at pharmacies starting April 1. CVS Health on Thursday said its drug plans will cover the first over-the-counter birth control pill in the U.S. at no cost for many health plan sponsors, a decision that could open the door for more people to prevent unintended pregnancies without a prescription.\nThe company’s pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark, said the pill will be added to its preventive services oral contraceptives list and will be covered at zero cost for many sponsors. The drug, known as Opill from Perrigo , was available at pharmacies starting April 1, according to a pharmacy update from CVS Caremark dated last week and viewed by CNBC.\nPharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, maintain lists of drugs covered by health insurance plans and negotiate drug discounts with manufacturers. At most stores, Opill has a retail price of $19.99 for a one-month supply and $49.99 for a three-month supply.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Perrigo’s medication in July. It marks the first time that many U.S. residents are able to buy birth control pills over the counter, the same way they would purchase common pills like Tylenol or Advil.\nThe drug could significantly expand availability of contraception, especially for younger women and those in rural and underserved communities who often have trouble getting access to birth control methods.\nMedical organizations have estimated that 45% of the 6 million annual pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended.\nThe pill’s entrance into the market is a win for the Biden administration, which has tried to shore up reproductive rights as abortion restrictions rise in many states.\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling more than a year ago, which ended 50 years of federal abortion rights, has led to shrinking availability of the procedure nationwide and renewed calls for expanded access to birth control.\nFive stocks to buy and hold for the long term, according to the pros These are Piper Sandler’s favorite stocks for the second quarter Energy might be the ‘story of the summer,’ one chief investment officer says.
