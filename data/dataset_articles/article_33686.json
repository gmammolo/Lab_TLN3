  "text": "Ohio is home to about 275,000 people who are blind or visually impaired. The state is making sure they can experience Monday's solar eclipse, too, with special technology that sets the tone for inclusion. \"It's kind of a day of celebration, something that's literally a once-in-a-lifetime event since the last time it happened was 200 years ago,\" Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said. \"These LightSound devices are going to help those with low vision or no vision have a chance to participate.\" The state recently received 29 LightSound devices to place at 29 of its state parks and properties in the eclipse's path of totality. \"There's a light sensor in there that senses the light and then translates that into the tone,\" explained Berna King with Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities. As the eclipse passes over that light sensor, the tone changes allowing those who are blind or have low vision to follow along with the experience. Hope Williams, 19, is a student at the Ohio State School for the Blind. \"I thought it was really cool the way the frequency changed,\" Williams said. She's excited to be part of the epic experience. \"Just to kind of know what's happening and stuff. So that I know when the moon fully covers it,\" Williams said. Her principal Michelle Wagner agrees. \"It definitely is inclusion and just gives us an opportunity to experience what everyone else is,\" Wagner said. The LightSound devices will be placed in an area of those 29 state parks and properties where people can gather around to hear the changing tone as the moon moves across the face of the sun. \"Every single day we're trying to look for ways to make the outdoors more accessible, and you know the solar eclipse is sort of the ultimate outdoor experience,\" said Ohio Department of Natural Resources Director Mary Mertz. It's an experience anyone can now see or hear. \"It gives way more opportunities than just having someone describe it,\" Williams said. The state received the LightSound devices for free through a partnership with Harvard University.",
