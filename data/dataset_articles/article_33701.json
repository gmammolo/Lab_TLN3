Packed with fresh veggies, olives, and feta, it's super flavorful and great for meal prep.\nThis lentil salad recipe is helping me ease into a new lunch routine. After a summer filled with\npicnic leftovers and impromptu farmers market meals, I’m trying to get back in the rhythm of doing at least a little meal prep at the start of the week. That way, at lunchtime, I’m not totally stumped by what to eat.\nLuckily, this lentil salad recipe is simple to make, so it’s a breeze to put together on a Sunday. It also tastes so good that I don’t mind eating it for a few days on repeat. I douse al dente lentils, juicy cherry tomatoes, crisp veggies, briny olives, and feta in a zingy lemon dressing. And, because I believe that fresh herbs make any salad better, I toss in mint and parsley for a cooling, refreshing finishing touch.\nIf you’re looking for new lunch ideas right now, I can’t recommend this lentil salad highly enough. It’s intensely flavorful and super satisfying. It won’t be leaving my lunchtime rotation anytime soon. I think you’ll love having it in yours too.\nLentil Salad Recipe Ingredients\nHere’s what you’ll need to make this lentil salad recipe:\n- Lentils, of course! I like to use French lentils for this salad. They hold their shape nicely when cooked, and they don’t get mushy like brown or red lentils do.\nFind my guide to cooking the lentils here.\n- Grape tomatoes – I love their sweet flavor and juicy texture in this salad. Any type of cherry or grape tomatoes will work here, but I think yellow ones are especially pretty.\n- Cucumbers and radishes – For crunch.\n- Red onion – For sharp, savory flavor.\n- Lacinato kale – I always like to sneak greens into lunch salads when I can. I use kale here because it holds up well under the dressing even when I make this salad in advance.\n- Green olives – They add delicious briny flavor. Not a green olive person? Feel free to use kalamata olives instead.\n- Feta cheese – For saltiness and tang.\n- The dressing – It’s a zingy combo of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. To add complexity to the salad, I also mix in ground cumin and either\nItalian seasoningor za’atar. Use whichever you keep in your pantry.\n- And fresh mint and parsley – For cooling, aromatic flavor.\nFind the complete recipe with measurements below.\nWhisk together the dressing ingredients at the bottom of a large bowl.\nThen, add the salad ingredients on top. Toss to coat and season to taste.\nThat’s it!\nLentil Salad Serving Suggestions\nThis lentil salad recipe keeps well for up to 4 days in the fridge, so it’s perfect for making ahead for lunches. Enjoy it on its own, or serve it as a side dish with a\nCaprese sandwich, chickpea salad sandwich, or healthy lunch wrap.\nI also love to include this lentil salad on a\nmezze platter if I’m putting together a light dinner or making lunch for friends. It pairs nicely with tabbouleh or a tomato salad and a few spreads like muhammara, whipped feta, baba ganoush, or hummus. Round out the meal with lots of fresh pita bread!\nHow do you like to serve this lentil salad?
