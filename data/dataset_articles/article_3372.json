  "text": "On Saturday, Jan. 6, the New Mexico State Police (NMSP) are coordinating a second Gun Buyback Event in Española, Albuquerque, Farmington and Las Cruces. People may anonymously hand in unwanted guns and receive Visa gift cards in return. No questions will be asked about who owns the guns or where they came from. Buybacks are intended to prevent unwanted or unneeded guns from causing harm or being used to commit acts of violence. The events will take place 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Satirday, Jan. 6 at the following locations: - ESPAÑOLA – at the Española Annex Building at 1101 Industrial Park Road; - ALBUQUERQUE – at the Expo New Mexico at 300 San Pedro, Gate 8 off Louisiana Blvd.; - FARMINGTON – at the Harriet B Simmons Office at 101 W Animas; and - LAS CRUCES – at the First Baptist Church located at 4201 N. Sonoma Ranch Blvd. Buyback Event details: - $100 Visa gift card for handguns; and - $200 Visa gift card for rifles and shotguns. Guns may be functional or non-functional. “We are providing people a resource to turn in unwanted guns; helping law enforcement combat violent crimes where guns are used and aiding in the reduction of accidental deaths and suicides,” NMSP Chief Troy Weisler said. “By holding responsible voluntary gun disposal events like this, we can all help make New Mexico safer.”",
