  "text": "MADISON, Wisc. (WKOW) -- Well before he was leading the Alabama Crimson Tide to the program's first-ever Final Four, Nate Oats was looking for a chance to break into coaching back in 2000. Fresh out of graduate school, the Watertown native volunteered as an assistant coach for the UW-Whitewater Warhawks for two seasons. Oats spent his two seasons on staff working with two different head coaches. Soon-to-be longtime head coach Pat Miller kept Oats on his staff as he took over the Warhawks program in 2001, citing free help at the D3 level is never something to turn away. Even over 20 years later, Miller believes Oats could have gone anywhere he wanted based off of how sharp he came off. \"Nate's one of those guys [who is] just very well read, well spoken. A very intelligent guy. So that's what struck me in the beginning,\" said Miller, who retired last summer after 22 years of coaching for UW-Whitewater. \"Sometimes, there are certain people in coaching you look at and you say, 'Man, if this guy would have done anything else, he would have been hugely successful [had he gone a different path].'\" And it's impressive how fast Oats transformed the Crimson Tide's men's basketball program since he took over in 2019: two SEC regular season championships, a pair of conference title victories and two previous rides to the Sweet Sixteen. However, Miller admires one thing over the rest when it comes to Oats' laundry list of achievements: his humble nature. \"Whether it's recruiting stuff [or] just catching up, he's the same guy as he was 20 years ago. He's just on a bigger stage, and he's achieved great success,\" Miller said. Whether it was basketball or in general, Miller always knew his then-assistant coach was virtually prepared for anything. Back when the Warhawks were nearing an intense showdown with UW-Stevens Point, Miller carried a big plate of wrangling players ahead of the bus ride and game planning. So much, he forgot to pack his own suit for the sideline. Call it luck or unintentional instinct, Oats happened to be prepared with two of everything for that night's game. \"And I said, 'Seriously? What size are you?' Exact same size suits. Exact same size shoes. I remember laughing and saying 'So Nate, if you would have just brought one suit, you know who would have been wearing it today, right?'\" To this day, Miller and Oats still keep in touch with the most recent coming when Alabama punched its ticket to the Final Four. Oats replied to the text titling the moment as 'surreal' to which Miller sent his follow up: 'You better get locked in because it's not done yet.' Fourth-seeded Alabama will take on overall top seed UConn in the Men's Final Four on Saturday night with tip-off scheduled for 7:49 p.m. Central.",
