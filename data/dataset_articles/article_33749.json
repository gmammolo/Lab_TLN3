  "text": "DETROIT – It is April 2024 and many people are preparing to don their eclipse glasses for the highly anticipated solar eclipse [which is only a few days away](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2024/03/31/expert-breaks-down-what-you-need-to-know-about-april-8-solar-eclipse/). The rare celestial event brings people from all over together to experience the breathtaking sight of the obscured Sun. [The total solar eclipse on April 8](https://www.clickondetroit.com/topic/Total_Solar_Eclipse_2024/) will be passing through Ohio and Indiana with [a small portion of Michigan in the path of the eclipse](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2024/04/03/why-you-probably-shouldnt-go-to-this-michigan-city-to-watch-april-8-solar-eclipse/). With the next coast-to-coast solar eclipse not happening until 2045 and the next eclipse visible from Michigan not occurring until 2099, many have made are planning trips and RSVPing for eclipse-related events to take advantage of the nearly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a solar eclipse within driving distance of their home. In the midst of all of the excitement for the event, Local 4 Meteorologist Ashlee Baracy took an opportunity to speak with Dr. David Gerdes, [the Chair of Physics and Professor of Astronomy at the University of Michigan](https://websites.umich.edu/~gerdes/), about this year’s eclipse as well as what precautions should be taken to safely observe it. “Eclipses are a beautiful thing to watch and experience, and it’s important to keep in mind safety precautions when doing so,” said Professor Gerdes when asked about safely observing the solar eclipse, “It is never safe to look at the Sun without eye protection whether during an eclipse or not, so during the partial phases of the eclipse, you have to look at the Sun wearing a pair of special eclipse glasses which are like very dark sunglasses.” The special eclipse glasses provided for these events are essential for those wanting to observe the partial phases of the eclipse whether it is done with their own eyes or through the lens of a camera as attempting to observe the eclipse without proper protection can permanently damage your eyesight [or the lens of the camera you look through](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/why-a-solar-eclipse-could-ruin-your-phone-camera/). Regardless of where you purchase or obtain these glasses or lens filters from it is also important to know whether the filters meet safety standards for the eclipse or not. “If you can see your surroundings, they’re probably not good enough to be eclipse glasses,” Professor Gerdes advised. If you’re unable to obtain a pair of eclipse glasses or a filter for your camera, there are other ways to observe the partial phases of the eclipse. As Professor Gerdes mentions, there are ways to make homemade “pinhole projectors” that will project the eclipse onto a wall or floor. Kitchen colanders will also work as a sort of “projector” for the eclipse. Read: [Why you need special glasses to view a solar eclipse](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/03/why-you-need-special-glasses-to-view-a-solar-eclipse/) These methods of observation are absolutely necessary in order to safely enjoy the early and late phases of the solar eclipse, but for the few moments of totality, for those that are in the areas of 100% totality, observers may safely look directly at the Sun to take in the amazing, rare sight of the Sun’s corona. “The special thing about totality is that during those few minutes of the total eclipse when the moon is completely covering the sun you can take your glasses off you can look directly at the Sun, and you will see that beautiful solar corona that is there all the time but is not visible under ordinary conditions,” said Professor Gerdes. However, in Detroit, we will be getting a 99% partial eclipse, and though most of the sun will be eclipsed, it is still not advised to look at the partial eclipse without proper eye protection as Professor Gerdes advises, “1% of the Sun’s light is about 400 times brighter than the full Moon. It’s a lot of light, it will cast shadows, the sky will be blue, it is not safe to look at the Sun even when it’s 99% eclipsed.” Related: [Most of Michigan will see 99% of total solar eclipse. Is that enough?](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/most-of-michigan-will-see-99-of-total-solar-eclipse-is-that-enough/) Eclipse glasses are readily available at different retailers, they’ll be given out at several eclipse-related events and many libraries will be giving out glasses for the event in Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. It is strongly recommended that those who wish to enjoy this rare event obtain a pair beforehand to safely observe the Sun during any social eclipse. For more information on where to get a pair of approved eclipse glasses, [we have an article detailing several events providing them here](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/national/2024/04/04/where-to-buy-safe-solar-eclipse-glasses-in-michigan/).
