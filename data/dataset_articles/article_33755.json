  "text": "KNOXVILLE, Tennessee — A new program, [BSN Scholars](https://www.utmedicalcenter.org/blog-post/bsn-scholars-program-announced), offers a new path for University of Tennessee Nursing students to graduate faster, and with less student debt. In exchange for the UT Medical Center paying tuition so future nurses can attend nursing school, students will work at the hospital for three years. \"This is an amazing opportunity, we are being involved in a program where we're able to practice in these amazing facilities that mirror the University of Tennessee Medical Center,\" said Lauren Denney, a BSN Scholar student. \"And with that, we are improving patient care as a whole.\" This program provides an impressive incentive — job security and a scholarship — but also incentivizes students who come to UT to stay in Knoxville. \"I think Knoxville as a whole is beginning to draw more and more people. It's beautiful. The weather's nice, what's not to love?\" said Savannah Blanchard, another BSN Scholar. \"So then, you add in a great medical center on top of all of that, with great staff, and great providers, and great patient community — then what more could you ask for?\" In addition to keeping more qualified nurses in Knoxville after they get their degree at UT, it also increases the number of nursing student spots in the College of Nursing. \"It takes a lot of resources, and a lot of time and energy and commitment to train one registered nurse,\" said Victoria Niederhauser, the Dean of the College of Nursing. \"For us to bring in another 100 into our fold has been a heavy lift and a lot of effort. But by partnering together with UTMC, it certainly lightens that load.\" A nationwide nursing shortage affects hospitals here in East Tennessee, and the UT Medical Center is no different. \"It's also important that we are producing very high-quality nurses who are well prepared to meet the demands that patients,\" said Sandy Leake, the Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer at UTMC. \"We have patients who are sicker, they require more care.\" Prospective students wishing to learn more about the BSN Scholars program can visit their website [here](https://nursing.utk.edu/bsn-scholars-interest-form/).",
