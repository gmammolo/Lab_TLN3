  "text": "Shannen Doherty is selling some of her possessions as she continues her cancer battle (Gray News) - [Shannen Doherty](https://www.instagram.com/theshando/?hl=en) says she’s letting some things go as she continues to battle breast cancer. The 52-year-old actress shared in a recent episode of her podcast [“Let’s Be Clear with Shannen Doherty,”](https://www.youtube.com/@LetsBeClearSD) that her priorities have changed because of her illness. “The cancer, for me, has really made me take stock of my life and shift my priorities, and my priority at the moment is my mom,” [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/02/entertainment/shannen-doherty-decluttering-cancer/index.html) quoted Doherty. “I don’t want her to have a bunch of stuff to deal with. I don’t want her to have four storage units filled with furniture.” Doherty continued by saying her “furniture obsession” is just one of her passions but that everyone, including her, can do a little bit of downsizing. “Do I need to have three dining room tables? The answer is no, none of us really need all the stuff that we have, and we could all do with a little bit of downsizing and not be a hoarder, which I was becoming with all my furniture,” Doherty is quoted in the [New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/entertainment/cancer-stricken-shannen-doherty-prepares-for-death-by-selling-items/). The [“Beverly Hills 90210″](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098749/) star also shared that letting things go hasn’t been easy, but she has been using the money she’s getting from selling items to do things like take trips with her mother and making memories. Doherty was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015 before going into remission two years later. In 2020, Doherty announced that the cancer had returned and in late 2023 said that [the illness had spread](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/entertainment/shannen-doherty-cancer/index.html) to her bones.
