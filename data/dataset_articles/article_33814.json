  "text": "King Charles has reportedly given royal aides the green light to prepare for a tour of Australia.\nThis comes as his\ncancer treatment appears to be having positive effects, two months after he publicly confirmed his diagnosis after undergoing treatment for an enlarged prostate.\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: The King to visit Australia.\nStream the world's best reality, entertainment and true-crime shows free on\n7plus\nThe King, 75, and his wife\nQueen Camilla, 76, are set to return to Australian shores in October.\n“The King is raring to go and keen to get on with the job,” a palace source told\nThe Sun.\nThe source reported the King is “over the moon” with how his treatment is progressing, prompting the King’s team to “supercharge” the Australia plans.\n“He knows he can’t hang around and is feeling extremely positive after tests meant he could attend the\nEaster Sunday service and spend time meeting the public, which he has missed,” the source said.\n“Although his doctors are keeping an eye on his\nhealth, he’s itching to take the reins and get back to his public role as head of state.\n“He wants to follow his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s mantra, that he needs to be seen to be believed.”\nThe King and Queen are set to embark on a two-week trip across Australia, New Zealand and Samoa.\nHowever, the insider reports the itinerary will be stripped back to allow for more downtime, ensuring the King has enough recovery between commitments.\nIt was announced in February that the King has been receiving treatment for cancer after undergoing a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate.\nWhile he kept a low profile following the news, Charles and Camilla made a significant public appearance at an\nEaster Service last weekend, shaking hands and speaking with onlookers.\nThe milestone was a major positive sign of his recovery.\nThe King’s most recent visit to Australia was as the Prince of Wales in 2018, for the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane.\nHe has previously made the trip to Australia at least 15 times, with official visits to every state and territory, as well as attending Geelong Grammar School’s Timbertop campus as a student in 1966.\nIt is believed Charles’ visit could coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Samoa in October.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese released a statement on March 4 about preparations for King Charles to tour Down Under.\n“The King has shown his compassion for Australians affected by recent natural disasters, just as Australians have shown compassion and support for the King following his cancer diagnosis,” he said.\n“The King, Queen, and members of the royal family are always welcome in Australia.”\nThe late\nQueen Elizabeth II last came to Australia in 2011, visiting Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra.\nElizabeth, who died in 2022, currently remains the only serving monarch to have made the trip to Australia — visiting 16 times throughout her reign.\nStream free on",
