  "text": "TEMPLE HILLS, MD — December 28 brought unexpected fortune for Elektra Long, a Prince George’s County resident, who nearly discarded a $100,000 winning ticket. A regular player of Pick 3, Pick 4, and scratch-off games, Long had purchased two $10 Snow Globe 7s tickets. Initially overlooking the value of her purchase, she nearly threw them away before realizing she had won the top prize. The 52-year-old frequents Brinkley Market for her Lottery purchases. She has a specific preference for the first two tickets in a book of scratch-offs. On this occasion, Long almost missed her chance, mistakenly believing the remaining Snow Globe 7s tickets weren’t the first two. Fortunately, she remembered the store clerk’s habit of loading tickets in reverse order. Initially, Long didn’t recognize her win and almost discarded her ticket. After a careful second and third review, she discovered her fortune, expressing gratitude for not having thrown the ticket away. A civilian paralegal for the U.S. Air Force, Long plans to use her winnings to pay off bills and support her grandchildren. When not working, she enjoys playing the Lottery. Brinkley Market, located at 3311 Brinkley Rd in Temple Hills, will receive a $1,000 bonus for selling the winning scratch-off ticket.",
