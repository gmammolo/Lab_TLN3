  "text": "In a novel approach to environmental conservation and public health, the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) has announced a buyback scheme for collecting waste that contributes to the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes, a known vector for dengue fever. The initiative, revealed by Mayor Md Atiqul Islam during a discussion in Dhaka on Thursday, aims to involve the community in efforts to combat dengue by removing potential breeding grounds from the environment. Mayor Atiqul detailed DNCC's plan to purchase various discarded items that accumulate water and facilitate mosquito breeding. \"To tackle the dengue menace, we are embarking on a mission to acquire polythene, chips packets, ice cream cups, coconut shells, unused tyres, commodes, and other refuse from our citizens,\" he explained. Hospitals asked to be ready to provide treatment to dengue patients: Health Minister Residents are encouraged to bring these items to their local councilor's office in exchange for cash rewards, fostering a collective effort to cleanse the city. The collected waste will be gathered daily by cleaning crews from each ward and transported to the nearest Secondary Transfer Station (STS), ensuring a systematic approach to waste management. Mayor Atiqul expressed optimism that this initiative would discourage littering and motivate residents to participate actively in keeping their surroundings clean. A price list for the abandoned items was also established, with compensation ranging from Tk 100 for every 100 chips packets or ice cream cups, Tk 50 per kg for unused polythene, to Tk 100 for discarded commodes or basins. The scheme is set to commence after Eid from the councilor's offices in each ward. 11 more dengue patients hospitalised in 24hrs In addition to launching the waste buyback program, Mayor Atiqul Islam extended Eid-ul-Fitr and Pahela Baishakh greetings to councilors and officials. He highlighted the importance of conducting a post-Eid campaign, led by ward councilors, to enhance dengue awareness and prevention measures.",
