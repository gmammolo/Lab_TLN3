  "text": "Texas RB CJ Baxter: Overcoming Injuries & Eyeballing Lead Role at Texas Longhorns\nBy the Numbers\nTexas Longhorns sophomore running back CJ Baxter is prepared to step into the lead role, following the departure of Jonathon Brooks to the NFL. Despite injuries slowing him down as a sophomore, Baxter has a record of impressive performances dating back to high school, demonstrating his potential for the upcoming season.\n- Baxter rushed for 1,651 yards and 22 touchdowns as a junior in high school.\n- As a freshman at Texas, he had 53 carries for 260 yards and three touchdowns.\n- Baxter finished the 2023 cycle as the nation’s top-ranked running back.\n- Baxter is transitioning into the lead running back role for the Longhorns, with the coaching staff focusing on his development.\n- There is a need for Baxter to provide the power in the projected 1-2 punch with junior Jaydon Blue.\nBaxter's increased comfort level in the spring practices is expected to further unlock his natural running ability.Bottom Line\nCJ Baxter's journey from high school to college and his resilience in the face of injuries position him well for a promising season as the lead running back for the Texas Longhorns.\nRead more at Burnt Orange Nation\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
