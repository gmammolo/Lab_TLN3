  "text": "Yellow Rose Campaign: A first responder’s mental health sanctuary EATON COUNTY, Mich. (WILX) - First responders may be asked to put their lives on the line every time they show up for work, and that reality carries a lot of mental stress and pressure. Delta Township Fire Chief Gregg Ginebaugh said what firefighters, paramedics, and police see on the job has contributed to a rising rate of suicide among first responders. Suicide prevention is just one component of the Yellow Rose campaign. From the yellow rose pin on the chief’s uniform to the yellow rose sign out front, yellow roses are prominent at the Delta Township Fire Department. “It’s to indicate to anybody in the fire service who happens to be driving by, if they need somebody to talk to, they know it’s a safe place,” said Chief Ginebaugh. Mental health is a top priority for those who work at Delta Township Fire. Captain Ken Barnes, a 23-year veteran, says it used to be the “do the job, suck it up, you’ll get over it” mentality, but that all changed with the Yellow Rose campaign. “People are willing to talk about things; they’re not hiding it, because we’ve all been through things,” said Capt. Barnes. Chief Ginebaugh said firefighters who hold onto the mental stress of the job could end up paying for it later with failed marriages, substance abuse, or suicide. He said that whether it’s his listening ear, a conversation with fellow firefighters, or a meeting with a mental health specialist, he wants all his employees to know he is available to help. Chief Ginebaugh’s goal is to make people feel comfortable talking about mental health, and if they’re struggling with something, there’s a place they can turn. The Yellow Rose campaign was started by fire chiefs across Michigan six years ago and is now spreading to the law enforcement and corrections communities.
