We know you want to make a cure a reality too—and we can’t wait for you to join us!\nWhen you participate in a Community One Walk, the money you raise supports life-changing breakthroughs that give hope to everyone impacted by this disease. And, you’ll have a great time doing it! That’s because you’ll walk with a committed community that is passionate about doing whatever it takes to live in a world without T1D.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes children and adults suddenly. It has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle—and it’s serious and stressful to manage. There is nothing you can do to prevent T1D and there is currently no cure. But there is something you can do to help. Please register to walk with us today. We can’t do it without you.\nFor more information about this event, please contact .\nFiled Under:\nEvents",
