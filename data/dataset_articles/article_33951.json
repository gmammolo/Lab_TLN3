  "text": "Frontline emergency care has been enhanced in the New England region, following the official opening of the new Glen Innes Ambulance Station. Minister for Regional Health Ryan Park said the new station is part of the NSW Government's $232 million Rural Ambulance Infrastructure Reconfiguration (RAIR) program. \"The NSW Government is committed to investing in local infrastructure to support better health outcomes for rural and regional communities,\" Mr Park said. \"The Glen Innes Ambulance Station is an essential addition to our regional healthcare network. \"This purpose-built health facility equips our paramedics with the resources needed to meet the growing demand for emergency medical care in Glen Innes and the surrounding areas.\" The new station, located on the grounds of Glen Innes Hospital, replaced the 75-year-old station located on Bourke Street. Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Health, Dr Michael Holland, joined NSW Ambulance paramedics, local families and community members to mark the official opening. \"This new building provides a comfortable working environment for our dedicated paramedics and enhances out of hospital care in the region,\" Dr Holland said. NSW Ambulance Chief Executive Dr Dominic Morgan emphasised the positive impact the new station will have on the area. \"Glen Innes Ambulance Station will provide our paramedics with the latest facilities and equipment to continue to provide high quality emergency care to the communities of New England, now and into the future,\" Dr Morgan said. \"We're excited to have this new facility up and running for the community and our local crews.\" The new ambulance station includes internal parking for up to 5 emergency ambulance vehicles, staff common areas, administration and office areas, logistics and storage areas, a vehicle wash bay and a Medic Fit gym. Fifty-four new or upgraded ambulance stations are being delivered across NSW as part of the $232 million RAIR program. Planning is continuing for the $50 million Glen Innes Hospital Redevelopment and the community will continue to be updated on its progress.
