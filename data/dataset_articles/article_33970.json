  "text": "—\nThe recently released, all-natural sleep aids harness the sleep-enhancing benefits of CBN (cannabinol) in combination with CBD (cannabidiol). Together, the two compounds work synergistically to promote deep, restful sleep and relaxation. The gummies support the body’s natural sleep mechanisms for refreshing and rejuvenating rest and a better start to the day upon waking.\nMore details are available at\nhttps://www.thetrustedlab.com/product/good-night-cbn-gummies-150-mg/\nEach gummy is carefully crafted from high-quality, lab-tested, organic, gluten-free ingredients and contains five milligrams of fast-acting CBN. One jar of Good Night CBN Gummies contains 30 pieces for a total of 150 milligrams of CBN, The Trusted Lab says.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one-third of adults report they often don’t get enough sleep to be at their best the next day. Such a high proportion of sleep-deprived adults suggests natural sleep remedies would be welcome on the market.\nThe Trusted Lab’s Good Night CBN Gummies may be a superior alternative to melatonin-containing sleep aids. For some consumers, these supplements may have side effects such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness, and some users may develop dependency on them.\nThe company recommends users take one or two gummies with food just before bed and allow 15 minutes for maximum absorption. They also note that users should always listen to their bodies and adjust the dosage accordingly. The gummies are made from the highest-quality CBN concentrate, ensuring high absorption and bio-availability.\nAbout The Trusted Lab\nThe Trusted Lab crafts premium, hemp-derived CBD products for better health, relaxation, and performance. The manufacturing process is completely controlled by the company to ensure products’ maximum purity and potency. All products contain no more than 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and are independently third-party tested.\n“The Trusted Lab was founded to provide you the highest-quality, organic, natural, lab-tested, and safe American-grown hemp CBD products in the market today,” a company representative said. “Our powerful tinctures, edibles, and topical creams are the result of months of research and development, leading to top-of-the-line products for each of our categories. Every single product on our website has been tested for potency, quality and consumer tested.”\nInterested parties can learn more at\nhttps://www.thetrustedlab.com/product/good-night-cbn-gummies-150-mg/\nContact Info:\nName: Bianca Allison\nEmail:\nSend Email\nOrganization: The Trusted Lab\nAddress: 1251 East Airport Freeway, Irving, Texas 75062, United States\nPhone: +1-909-328-6829\nWebsite:\nhttps://www.thetrustedlab.com/\nRelease ID: 89126311",
