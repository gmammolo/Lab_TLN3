  "text": "HealingUS Communities (833-300-4673) has announced an update to their Intensive Peer Recovery Program, a peer-run day program in Toms River designed to help individuals recovering from drug and alcohol addiction transition into sober living.\nFarmingdale, United States - April 4, 2024 —\nThe non-profit organization is now accepting applicants into the Intensive Peer Recovery Program (IPRP), which will take place over the course of four consecutive weeks. The program is open to patients coming out of clinical treatment and recovering individuals who feel that they are unable to remain sober.\nFor more information, please visit https://healingus.org/intensive-peer-recovery-program/\nPeer support provides numerous benefits to individuals suffering from substance use disorders, especially when delivered in tandem with clinical treatment. According to a scientific review in Substance Abuse and Rehabilitation, studies have shown that members of peer support groups experience increased self-esteem, positive feelings of accomplishment, and a heightened ability to cope with challenges.\nHealingUS Communities’ IPRP is a more intensive option compared to typical peer support groups and focuses on re-introducing members to a sober lifestyle. The end goal of the program is to empower participants with the means to achieve long-term abstinence by allowing them to connect with other members of HealingUS, which is recognized as one of the most successful recovery communities in Toms River.\nThroughout the program, members will have the opportunity to participate in individual and group skill sessions that are intended to help them transition into society. These sessions will be facilitated by trained Peers in Recovery, who will aid participants in gaining independence, regulating their emotions, and relearning life skills essential for the earliest stages of recovery. Because HealingUS Communities acknowledges there are many ways to recover from addiction, the IPRP will also teach members recovery skills through 12-step facilitation and specific programs such as Refuge Recovery, Recover 2.0, and SMART Recovery.\nTo keep track of their progress, clients will form a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), which they can discuss and revise through weekly meetings with recovery coaches. Those in need of additional clinical care and mental health services can also consult their peer case managers, who will provide them with the resources to secure the treatment they require.\nAbout HealingUS Communities\nHealingUS Communities is a New Jersey 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was founded in 2012 to fill the gaps in alcohol and drug addiction treatment. Their recovery programs have helped thousands of families to date.\nInterested parties can learn more by visiting https://healingus.org/\nContact Info:\nName: Ashley Regan\nEmail: Send Email\nOrganization: HealingUS Communities\nAddress: 260 Casino Drive, Farmingdale, NJ 07727, United States\nPhone: +1-866-798-3232\nWebsite: https://www.healingus.org\nSource: PressCable\nRelease ID: 89126292\nIn case of detection of errors, concerns, or irregularities in the content provided in this press release, or if there is a need for a press release takedown, we strongly encourage you to reach out promptly by contacting error@releasecontact.com .
