  "text": "Children's Miracle Network radiothon kicks off GREENVILLE, N.C. (WITN) - The 27th annual Children’s Miracle Network (CMN) radiothon is underway here in the east with the goal to help sick and injured children get the help they need to recover. The radiothon goes from April 4th to the 5th from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on 107.9 WNCT. During the two-day radiothon, listeners will have the chance to tune into miracle stories from Maynard Children’s Hospital that would not be possible without the generous donations that directly support the programs and services at the hospital that help children recover. One hundred percent of the funds will go directly to the hospital that serves children and their families in the 29-county region in Eastern North Carolina. “People will hear throughout the two days, the janitors, the custodians, the greeters, everyone in that hospital treats these children and their families, like family. Then on top of that the amazing equipment that we are able to provide is all because of CMN dollars that we are raising at events like this radiothon,” said Elise Ironmonger, director of programs at Maynard Children’s Hospital. Last year they were able to raise $108,000 and this year they are hoping to beat that number. “We are never surprised by it because we know what this community can do and how it steps up when it’s asked for something as important as making sure kids get the type of healthcare that they need,” said Marc Miller of 107.9 WNCT.
