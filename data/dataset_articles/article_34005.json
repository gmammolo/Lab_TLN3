  "text": "Making their way through the hallways of Reuth Tel Aviv Rehabilitation Hospital (Reuth TLV) are dozens of men and women wearing yellow scrubs. These are volunteers who come to Reuth TLV from all over the world for a period of up to a year.\nWhile volunteering, they stay in apartments on the hospital campus and play a crucial role in streamlining work processes. They assist hospital staff with daily tasks, including transporting wheelchair-bound patients to their treatments, serving food to patients, organizing enrichment activities, and spending one-on-one time with them and their families. We sat down with three volunteers to speak about their volunteering experience duringwartime.\nTworwski, a 28-year-old medical student from Düsseldorf, Germany, came to Israel on a Masa program. After his program ended, he extended his stay and continues to volunteer at the hospital. Shakeera, a 38-year-old yoga instructor from Los Angeles, will be leaving Reuth TLV in two weeks after volunteering for just over a month. This is her second time visiting Israel and her first time volunteering at the hospital.\nLea is 28 years old and hails from Darmstadt, Germany. She is an architect and a guide at the Jewish Museum in Frankfurt. This is her second time volunteering at Reuth TLV. Lea shares her experience.\n“I first came to Israel on a student exchange program. I met amazing people and noticed that Israel felt like home. When I returned to Germany, I was looking for ways to come back and help the country. That is how I found out about Reuth TLV. The first time I volunteered at the hospital was a very difficult time for me.\nMy father was sick and passed away soon after I went back to Germany. Now, I’m at a different stage of my life. I finished school and have a stronger foundation. I have friends here and know what to expect. Reuth feels like a stable place where I can grow as a person.”\nHow does it feel to be in Israel at this time?\nTworwski: I feel at home here. I love the weather and the warmth of the Israeli people. I travel a lot around the country and visit my relatives who live in the North. My family knows I’m in a safe place and is proud of me for coming here.\nShakeera: My ex-husband is Israeli, and some of his friends were murdered at the Nova festival, so I wanted to come to Israel and help. My family is so worried that I’m here, mainly because the news overseas does not reflect reality.\nLea: After October 7, antisemitism around the world increased. I felt very uneasy about being a Jew abroad. I have a mezuzah outside my apartment and other Jewish symbols. There were significant anti-Israel protests in my area, and people I knew were also sharing anti-Israel messages.",
