  "text": "By Gladys Abakah\nTakoradi, Nov. 07, GNA – The Western Regional Branch of the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) has kicked off an extensive road safety awareness campaign ahead of the busy Christmas travel season.\nThe initiative, under the theme: “Safe Travels During Christmas: The Role of GPRTU in Ensuring Passenger Safety”, is meant to reduce road accidents during a time when travelling across the country typically peaked.\nMr. Joseph Simmons Cudjoe, the GPRTU Western Regional Chairman, speaking at the launch of the campaign at the Takoradi-Cape Coast Bus Terminal, said the campaign sought to promote a culture of mutual responsibility, while urging collaboration between drivers, passengers, and regulatory bodies to ensure a safer travel experience for all.\nHe highlighted the urgency of the campaign considering the rising road accidents in the Region, saying, “Awareness and training have become essential, especially with the holiday season and elections just around the corner.”\nMr. Cudjoe also cautioned against politically motivated conversations on public transport during the electioneering period, noting that such discussions could distract drivers.\n“While we are focused on promoting safe driving, we also need to consider the political atmosphere, especially political debates that can distract drivers”, he advised.\nMr. Victor Kojo Bilson, Western Regional Head, National Road Safety Authority (NRSA), commended the leadership of the GPRTU for the campaign, and said public education was key to reducing accidents on the roads.\nHe said the NRSA would continue to collaborate with transport unions to embark on public sensitisation exercises to help reduce road traffic crashes.\nSome of the drivers at the event expressed gratitude for the ongoing road safety education, noting that it had significantly improved their understanding of safe driving practices.\nThe campaign would extend to all GPRTU district terminals across the Western Region, including Nzema, Wassa, Bogoso-Asanco and Ahanta with training sessions targeting both drivers and passengers to ensure widespread adoption of safety protocols.\nGNA",
