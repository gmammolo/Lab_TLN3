  "text": "Dementia summit in South Bend provides a range of topics for dementia care SOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - A two-day summit in South Bend was devoted to innovations in the care of dementia patients. About 300 caregivers from throughout the Midwest attended the two-day gathering that wrapped up Thursday at the Ribbon Town Event Center. Topics ranged from the use of rhythmic drumming to reducing stress and anxiety. They included the use of housing models for dementia patients that are less institutional. “People with dementia are able to do so much more but we try to keep them safe in a locked unit. While I say that locked units is unsafe because people do not walk enough, they do not exercise enough they do not socialize enough so you should unlock and look at safety and risks in a different way,” said Eloy Van Hal, from the Hogeweyk an assisted living facility. “All people with dementia will die in a few years, so the question is how you want to live in those last years of life.” There was also a V-I-P party at Milton Village which is a South Bend facility that employs the Dementia Village concept.
