  "text": "Hope Village starts charging rent for transitional housing LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - One of Louisville’s answers to the homelessness crisis is undergoing a big transition. Hope Village, which started out with ice fishing tents, and offers transitional housing, is now going to charge its residents weekly rent. The organization running it said city funds are drying up and the residents agreed to pitch in. The new leases started last Friday. Residents will pay $75 per week, or they can work off that rent volunteering through the workforce program offered to them. One resident said he’s fine paying rent, because he knows he’ll need to pay when he transitions into a permanent home. “I’m trying to transition to the life I had before, which was paying rent, paying bills,” said Greg Donley. He has lived at Hope Village for a year now, after losing his home and living on the street when he got too sick to pay bills. Donley said he’s grateful for all the amenities here and said he has no problem paying weekly rent. “I’m going to do the $75, I have to,” said Donley. Stachelle Bussey came up with the idea for Hope Village. She said she didn’t want to start charging rent but with city funds drying up, the Village needed to find a new income stream to pay the utilities. It has to pay for propane for hot showers and electricity for the lights. “I tried my best not to do that, but after talking to the residents, having the meetings, we understand this is what needed to happen,” said Bussey. Residents can pay their rent in cash or work off their rent through the Village’s workforce development programs. Bussey said many residents wanted to give back after Hope Village gave them a helping hand. “If they get over a certain amount of hours we’re only saying, the different places that we have to volunteer, once you meet our requirement, the rest is yours we’ll write a check to you,” said Bussey. Donley said he hopes to fully transition back to permanent housing soon so his pod can be given to someone else like him. “My goal when I got here is that I can get out of here so my pod can be used for someone that was in the position I was a year ago,” said Donley.
