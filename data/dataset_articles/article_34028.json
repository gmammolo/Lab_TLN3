  "text": "Posted Nov 7, 2024 04:33:36 PM. Last Updated Nov 7, 2024 04:48:34 PM. The Cambridge Fire Department has been selected by the Fire Marshal’s Public Fire Safety Council (FMPFSC) to receive hundreds of new combination smoke and carbon monoxide detectors as part of the Safe Community Project Zero campaign. The safety initiative aims to bring deaths from carbon monoxide poisonings down to zero in Ontario, through awareness and the distribution of the devices. The campaign has been made possible through support from Enbridge Gas who has invested over $450,000 in the last 16 years to provide in excess of 101,000 alarms. “Cambridge Fire is very pleased to be selected for the Safe Community Project Zero,” said Fire Chief, Rob Martin in a press release. “These alarms will assist us in our Public Education Program to ensure our residents who need assistance, get these alarms in their homes.” It’s the second year in a row Cambridge Fire has participated in the initiative.",
