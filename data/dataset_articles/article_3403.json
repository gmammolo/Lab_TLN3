  "text": "- The CS announced that the government will soon run a programme to reward anti-banditry efforts by the public.\n- Kindiki also warned bandits who stole 500 camels in Isiolo on Thursday.\nSoon, members of the public who aid in identifying bandits across the country will be rewarded by the government, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki has said.\nThe CS announced that the government will soon run a programme to reward anti-banditry efforts by the public.\n\"Starting now, we will reward citizens and security officers who help us identify the ringleaders of banditry and recovery of stolen livestock,\" he said on Friday.\n\"Their efforts must count for something. We will offer monetary rewards, award state honours and medals to citizens who aid in efforts to bring to end the menace of livestock rustling.\"\nThe CS was speaking at Posta in Laikipia county where he was assessing the security situation.\nKindiki commended the efforts that saw the handover of heads of cattle that had been stolen, and recovered in full, and rewarded security officers, local leaders and youth whose collaborative efforts have realised the recovery in the area.\nThe Interior boss noted that to dismantle the infrastructure of cattle rustlers and facilitators, the government is sustaining the war on banditry and its perpetrators, enablers, benefactors and beneficiaries by making banditry a painful venture.\n\"Cattle rustling in Northern Kenya has over the years become an organised criminal enterprise responsible for deaths, destitution and displacement,\" Kindiki said.\n\"Its impacts are severe. It deprives pastoral communities their economic mainstay and aggravates the conditions of poverty in the rangelands, fuelling communal grievances and revenge attacks.\"\nHowever, he insisted that in 2024, it won't be business as usual.\nKindiki also warned bandits who stole 500 camels in Isiolo on Thursday.\nHe assured Isiolo residents that those camels will be recovered entirely, even if it meant stopping all other businesses to pursue them.\n\"And woe unto those boys who were involved in that theft and attempt to take on our officers. Any armed criminal who attacks innocent citizens and security officers is a threat to our sovereignty as a Nation and we shall never allow it,\" Kindiki added.\nTo intensify operations against bandits, the CS said in 2024 his ministry will operationalize all the subcounties, divisions, locations and sublocations to bring security closer to the people.\n\"We have decided, it is either the Nation or bandits. And there is no way the Nation can give way to criminals.,\" Kindiki added.",
