  "text": "[\n]( https://beautymatter.com/articles/motif-skincare-science-over-trends\n)\nDorion Renaud is a name that resonates with many, not just as a television personality and actor, but as a visionary entrepreneur who has made an indelible mark in the beauty industry. Known for his roles in BET’s College Hill and as a host on Extra, Renaud’s most loved and latest venture, Buttah Skin, has positioned him as a trailblazer in the world of skincare, particularly for melanin-rich skin. His brand, Buttah Skin, was built to serve not only as a testament to his entrepreneurial grit but also to become a beacon of inclusivity in an industry that has often overlooked the unique needs of [people of color](https://beautymatter.com/articles/politics-of-beauty-colorism).\nIn recent years, Buttah Skin, which kicked off in 2018, has grown from a passion project into a major player in the beauty world, securing spots on shelves at retailers like Ulta Beauty, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and HSN. Buttah Skin stands out in a crowded market because it was designed to cater to specific skincare concerns for people with darker skin tones like hyperpigmentation—concerns that many mainstream brands either ignore or fail to address adequately. In navigating this journey, Renaud’s personal experiences with problematic skin, his commitment to representation, and his determination to build a brand that speaks directly to Black and Brown consumers have all played a vital role in Buttah Skin’s success.\nRenaud’s journey into the world of skincare wasn’t a planned career move. It was born out of personal necessity. Growing up in Beaumont, Texas, Renaud struggled with skin issues, particularly as a young man trying to find his place in the world of entertainment. “I was dealing with acne, dark spots, uneven skin tone, all the things that come with having darker skin,” Renaud shares with BeautyMatter. “I was constantly in front of the camera, and I remember feeling embarrassed about my skin. It was tough, especially because I didn’t see a lot of products out there that were made for someone like me.”\nThis [lack of representation](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/black-representation-in-the-beauty-industry) in the beauty aisles struck a chord with Renaud, who, like many other Black men, found it difficult to find skincare solutions tailored to his specific concerns. Renaud’s early experiences in front of the camera—where every imperfection was magnified—pushed him to experiment with different products, eventually landing on a formula that worked for his skin. His personal concoction of shea butter [sourced directly from Ghana](https://beautymatter.com/articles/how-hanahana-beauty-built-a-community-led-brand), a vitamin C serum, and a gentle cleanser, became the foundation for what would later become Buttah Skin. “I thought, ‘Why not take what worked for me and make it available to people like me?’” Renaud said. “It was never just about selling products. It was about creating a solution for people who’ve been overlooked for so long. I knew there was a gap in the market, and I wanted to fill it.”\nThis focus on inclusivity is not just skin-deep. Buttah Skin’s product line is formulated specifically for melanin-rich skin, which tends to be more prone to hyperpigmentation, dryness, and uneven skin tone. For Renaud, addressing these concerns head-on was crucial to the brand’s success. “It’s not just about making products for the sake of it. It’s about solving problems that have been ignored by the larger beauty industry,” Renaud shared. “I wanted Buttah to be a celebration of melanin and to give it the glow it deserves.” One of the brand’s standout products is its Vitamin C Serum, which has garnered rave reviews for its ability to brighten the skin and fade dark spots—issues that disproportionately affect people with darker skin tones. By incorporating [natural, effective ingredients](https://beautymatter.com/articles/indigenous-african-ingredients-take-a-spot-on-beautys-global-stages) like [shea butter](https://beautymatter.com/articles/inside-africas-global-shea-butter-phenomenon), cocoa butter, and vitamin C, Buttah Skin has built a reputation for offering high-quality solutions for its target audience.\nNavigating the beauty industry as a Black entrepreneur comes with its own set of challenges, and Renaud was no stranger to the skepticism and pushback that often accompanied his business decisions. A notable example was when he decided to feature rapper 2 Chainz in one of Buttah Skin’s earliest campaigns. “There was a lot of resistance to that,” Renaud recalled. “People didn’t understand why I would put a Black rapper in a skincare campaign, but for me, it was about showing that there are so many different types of Black men, and they all deserve to be represented.”\nFor the brand, this decision wasn’t just about selling products. It was about changing the narrative around Black men and skincare. Historically, skincare has been predominantly viewed through the lenses of women, but Renaud saw a clear demand from Black men who were interested in taking care of their skin but didn’t always feel comfortable asking questions or seeking advice. “I saw so many men gravitating towards Buttah,” he said. “They wanted to take care of their skin, but they didn’t always have the confidence to ask. I wanted to shift the culture around men and self-care, especially for Black men.” This push for inclusivity and representation has been a cornerstone of Buttah Skin’s marketing strategy. By creating campaigns that feature a diverse range of skin tones, body types, and genders, Buttah has been positioned as a brand that truly embraces all facets of Black and Brown beauty. “Representation matters. When you see yourself reflected in a brand, it makes a difference. It tells you that you matter, that your skin and your concerns are valid,” Renaud says.\nUnlike many skincare brands that rely heavily on influencer marketing and celebrity endorsements, Buttah Skin’s growth has been largely organic. Renaud’s hands-on approach to building the brand has resonated with consumers, many of whom first heard about Buttah Skin through word of mouth or personal interactions with Renaud himself. “In the beginning, I’d give products away for free. I’d leave boxes at hotels, or if I was traveling, I’d hand out products at the airport,” Renaud says. “I’d even go to Macy’s and sign boxes. It felt like album signings back in the day, but for skincare. People can tell when a brand is real, and they can tell when it’s just about money. For me, Buttah is personal. I’m not just selling products. I’m sharing my journey, my story, and my struggles with people who can relate.” This grassroots approach helped Buttah Skin build a loyal following, particularly among Black and Brown consumers. Today, the brand has built a cult following of over 300,000 followers on media platforms like Instagram.\nAs Buttah Skin continues to expand, Renaud has begun to rethink his role within the company. After several years of being deeply involved in every aspect of the business, from product development to marketing, he made the difficult decision to step down as CEO in October 2024, to focus on his personal life and future ventures. “I was wearing too many hats,” Renaud admitted. “I was trying to be the CEO, the face of the brand, and everything in between. It got to a point where I needed to step back and let the brand grow on its own.” Despite stepping down from the day-to-day operations, Renaud remains closely tied to Buttah Skin, remaining its founder and visionary. However, stepping back from the operational grind was essential for him to regain balance and explore new creative ventures. “I’ve given so much to Buttah, and I’ll always be a part of it,” Renaud explained. “But I needed to take a step back for my peace, my sanity, and to allow myself space to think about what comes next. Sometimes, we think we have to be in control of everything for it to succeed,” he adds, “but the reality is, if you’ve built something strong, you have to trust it to grow without you.”\nAs for what’s next for Renaud, the possibilities seem endless. He has already begun working on new projects, including a book about reinvention, a theme he is intimately familiar with. “I’ve had to reinvent myself so many times in my career—whether it was from acting to hosting to now being an entrepreneur,” Renaud said. “It’s a journey, and I want to share what I’ve learned with others, especially people who may be going through similar transitions.” The founder also hinted at expanding his footprint in the beauty industry, teasing the possibility of another skincare line in the future. “There’s still so much work to be done in terms of serving people of color in the beauty space,” he says. “I’m not done yet—I’ve just scratched the surface.”\nDorion Renaud’s story is one of resilience, reinvention, and representation. His journey from a small-town boy from Beaumont to building a skincare empire that celebrates melanin-rich beauty is not just about business but also of purpose and pride. With Buttah Skin, Renaud has proven that the beauty industry can and should be more inclusive, and that real change happens when people step up to fill the gaps they see in the world.\nWant to continue reading this article and others just like it?\nSubscribe to BeautyMatter and access the most current beauty intelligence and news updates.\nAlready a member, [login here](https://beautymatter.com/account/login).",
