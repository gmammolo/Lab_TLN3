  "text": "Titans QB Will Levis Eager to Return from Shoulder Injury\nWill Levis, the Titans quarterback, is eager to return from a right shoulder injury and aims to play against the Chargers this Sunday. He expressed his competitive spirit, stating he has made considerable progress and is feeling good following full practice participation. Coach Brian Callahan noted an increase in Levis’s practice reps, highlighting his recovery and growing strength. Since Levis last played on October 13, Mason Rudolph has started, achieving strong performances.\n- Mason Rudolph has over 215 passing yards and one touchdown in each of his three starts.\n- Levis has not played since October 13, after initially injuring his shoulder on October 9.\nWhile Levis is keen to return, he must balance his eagerness with caution to avoid re-injury and maintain consistency in performance. Transitioning back into action can present challenges, as he has been away from live play for several weeks.\nState of Play- Levis participated fully in Thursday's practice after being limited on Wednesday.\n- Coach Callahan has planned for Levis to gradually increase his reps to facilitate his return.\nIf cleared to play, Levis will look to not just return to form, but also improve on his gameplay from earlier in the season, aiming for a seamless integration with the team.\nBottom LineLevis’s return could reignite the Titans' offense, but he must tread carefully to ensure his health and readiness for the challenges ahead. His approach will focus on operating effectively within the offense without over-pressuring himself for immediate results.\nRead more at www.tennesseetitans.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
