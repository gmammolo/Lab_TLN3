  "text": "First heat pump collective purchase campaign kicks off in Spain\nToday, Spanish consumer organisation and CLEAR HP partner OCU launches the project’s first collective purchase campaign of heat pumps. In Spain, the distribution and retail sale of these products has diversified and expanded significantly in recent years, driven by growing interest in more sustainable and energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions.\nAerothermal systems, which harness the thermal energy from the outside air to provide heating, cooling, and hot water, have become an attractive option for both retrofitting existing buildings and new constructions.\nIn 2023, it is estimated that around 180,000 aerothermal heat pumps were installed in Spain, representing a growth of over 200% compared to 2020. However, the cost of these products remains high, and subsidies are insufficient. Therefore, OCU is advocating for an improved subsidy scheme for the purchase and installation of these systems.\nConsumers in Spain can now sign up to participate in the campaign here. Signing up is the first step to accessing workshops on effectively adopting this technology. Consumers will also learn more about the advantageous turnkey offer, which includes energy certificates, before and after the installation; a visit from an installer, management of subsidies, tax credits and Energy Saving Certificates (in Spanish ‘CEAs’); installation and start-up, and after-sales service.\nNeed more information? Watch OCU’s first webinar (in Spanish) on switching to more sustainable heating and cooling solutions which already took place and is now available for everyone.\nThe CLEAR-HP project was created to facilitate consumers’ access to heat pumps by guiding them throughout the whole purchasing journey. In seven European countries, CLEAR HP project partners aim to promote consumer awareness and empower them to lead the clean energy transition, improving the energy performance and comfort of their homes, and reducing their energy bills.\nAt the heart of this project are a series of collective purchase campaigns based on ‘purchase and install’ packages, designed and tested to help consumers to adopt renewable heating systems in a simple and transparent way.\nThe project will continue with the launch of CPCs for heat pumps in Portugal in December 2024, while all other partners will launch their first campaigns in the first half of 2025.",
