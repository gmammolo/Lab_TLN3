  "text": "In today’s world, it can be easy to feel discouraged and anxious about the future. But no matter what is going on around us, Jesus Christ has provided a powerful antidote to fear and uncertainty—the sacrament.\nA Weekly Assurance\nDuring the sacrament, we receive an incredible promise of spiritual power—one that we may forget is available to us, even in the moments we need it most. We receive the covenantal promise that “[we] may always have his Spirit to be with [us].” Author Gerald N. Lund explains:\n“Can we think of another gift more critical to our happiness and progression in this world that is both great and dreadful than having the promise that a member of the Godhead will be our constant companion? We may not know how that is possible, but it is. And that is what makes this day in which we are living a great day for us.”\nAfter receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have access to divine help, guidance, and comfort—at any time. Whether we’re worried about our loved ones or unsure how to navigate the nuances of today’s world, we can pray to recognize the Spirit and seek His influence even more in our lives.\nPersonal Revelation Unlocks Peace\nThe Savior knew we would need divine help and guidance, so He provided a Comforter. As President Russell M. Nelson has taught, “[I]n coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.”\nWhile we often focus on the Spirit’s capacity to influence our emotions, inspiring feelings of warmth or reassurance, He also brings peace to our lives through personal revelation. As Sheri Dew wrote, “Personal revelation is a powerful, persuasive antidote to uncertainty and confusion.”\nIf you can’t always feel His presence or struggle to discern whether you’re receiving revelation, that doesn’t mean the Holy Ghost isn’t there. Mental health challenges can impact how we recognize the Spirit, and divine guidance may look or feel different in various seasons of our lives.\nAs Jenni Turley, a licensed clinical social worker, shared, “The Spirit can talk to us differently at different phases in life. Maybe one way that we received answers before isn’t going to be the way that we receive answers during this particular difficulty.”\nFacing the Future with Faith\nNo matter our specific situation, the Holy Ghost can be our constant companion, blessing us with the insights, guidance, and comfort we need.\nThe scriptures remind us that there is no problem too complicated for the Spirit’s help: “For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do” (2 Nephi 32:5, emphasis added).\nSo, next time you find yourself worrying about the future or feeling anxious about your loved ones, think of the sacrament as a chance to bring your fears to the Lord, receive personalized comfort, and seek the Spirit’s guidance.\nAs President Russell M. Nelson recently taught, “The best is yet to come as we fully turn our hearts and our lives to Jesus Christ.”\nTo Always Have His Spirit\ndeseretbook.com.\nFor more ideas about facing the future with faith, check out the articles below.\n▶ The soothing one-liner from Psalms you may need right now\n▶ 2 doctrines to hold on to when your child steps away from the Church\n▶ The must-read line from ‘The Chosen’ creator’s incredible BYU devotional",
