  "text": "Inaugural Caregiver Olympics held at Southern Hills Mall SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - Several local healthcare organizations came together to participate in their inaugural Caregiver Olympics. The organizations participated against each other in teams of three at the Southern Hills Mall. They had to make a bed, put a shirt on a mannequin and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Once teams were finished a judged panel looked at their results. This was to educate people on what they do. “We wanted to have a fun event to raise awareness the very important and sometimes difficult work that caregivers do so we invited agencies that have caregivers go in the homes of others,” said Kristen Hammerstrom of Visiting Angels. This also shows a few of the things caregivers do. “It also showcases how difficult it can be. Not only for family members that are doing it, but we want to raise awareness there are services in town that you can get help because no one can do it on their own because as I said it is very difficult to care for a loved one,” said Kim Wilson of Hospice of Siouxland. This event was held in conjunction with National Care at Home Month. Copyright 2024 KTIV. All rights reserved.",
