As a food and mental health blogger, Camryn explores how food and cooking can help improve mental health and also be an avenue to connect with one's culture and heritage. EatingWell's Editorial Guidelines Published on November 7, 2024 Close Photo: Photographer: Brie Goldman, Food Stylist: Lauren McAnelly, Prop Stylist: Gabriel Greco Serve up one of these casserole dishes as your main course for dinner tonight. With ingredients like whole grains, chicken, fish and legumes, these balanced meals are fitting for the Mediterranean diet, one of the healthiest and easiest eating patterns to follow. Recipes like our Chicken Spaghetti Casserole and Cheesy Black Bean & Quinoa Skillet Casserole are healthy and tasty options when you're craving something warm and cozy. 01 of 20 Chicken Florentine Casserole Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Jennifer Wendorf, Prop Stylist: Lindsey Lower This creamy chicken Florentine casserole combines tender pieces of chicken, fresh spinach and a rich, creamy sauce, all baked to perfection with a golden, cheesy crust. Whether you’re looking to cozy up on a chilly evening or share a hearty, home-cooked dinner with family, this casserole delivers an experience that feels like a warm hug on a plate. View Recipe 02 of 20 Teriyaki Chicken Skillet Casserole with Broccoli Photographer: Brie Goldman, Food Stylist: Lauren McAnelly, Prop Stylist: Gabriel Greco Whip up this quick and easy teriyaki chicken casserole in just one skillet—it’s the perfect go-to recipe for hectic weeknights that’s sure to satisfy a crowd. It’s ideal for making use of any leftover chicken and rice you have on hand. If you’re short on leftovers, a rotisserie chicken paired with a package of microwaveable brown rice is a good substitute. View Recipe 03 of 20 Kale & White Bean Potpie with Chive Biscuits In this vegetarian white bean potpie recipe, kale and hearty white beans are topped with easy, homemade chive biscuits. If desired, add a little shredded Gruyère or Cheddar cheese to the biscuit dough. View Recipe 04 of 20 Skillet Tuna Noodle Casserole Photography / Fred Hardy, Styling / Ruth Blackburn / Audrey Davis Known as Tuna-Pea Wiggle to some, this family-friendly tuna noodle casserole tends to be made with canned soup and whole milk, but we make our own creamy mushroom sauce with nonfat milk thickened with a bit of flour. Look for whole-wheat egg noodles--they have more fiber than regular egg noodles (but this dish will work well and taste great with either). View Recipe 05 of 20 Chicken & Quinoa Casserole Photographer: Jen Causey, Food Stylist: Torie Cox, Prop Stylist: Claire Spollen This aromatic and flavorful dish feels like veggie pizza in casserole form with fresh basil, herb-spiked diced tomatoes and ooey-gooey melted cheese on top. If you can't find fresh mozzarella ciliegine, buy a larger ball and tear it into pieces. Preheating your baking sheets helps encourage caramelization of the roasted veggies, which adds layers of flavor to this savory dinner. View Recipe 06 of 20 Anti-Inflammatory Lemony Salmon & Orzo Casserole Stacy k. Allen, Props: Julia Bayless, Food Stylist: Ana Kelley This lemony salmon and orzo casserole is a one-dish dinner that's packed with omega-3 fatty acids—a polyunsaturated fat in salmon that can help tame inflammation and may even help lower blood pressure. Here, omega-3-rich salmon sits on top of an orzo mixture that bakes in the oven, instead of boiling on the stovetop, absorbing all the bright and lemony flavors while it cooks. View Recipe 07 of 20 Pesto Tuna Noodle Casserole Photographer: Grant Webster, Food Stylist: Holly Dreesman, Prop Stylist: Lexi Juhl A creamy pesto sauce with sweet shallots and wilted spinach gives a light and bright spin to classic tuna noodle casserole. Albacore tuna is an ideal choice, as it holds its texture well once mixed in, although any water-packed tuna will do the job. For the best results, we recommend using refrigerated pesto for its fresh flavor which enhances the overall dish. View Recipe 08 of 20 Chicken Fajita Casserole Photographer: Rachel Marek, Food stylist: Holly Dreesman View Recipe This chicken fajita casserole combines classic fajita veggies and chicken thighs with corn tortillas and spices in one skillet for an easy dinner. Chicken thighs are tender and flavorful, but chicken breast or leftover chicken will work well too. Serve this easy casserole topped with your favorite fixings, like sour cream, avocado, salsa and/or chopped tomato. 09 of 20 Chicken Piccata Casserole Photographer: Morgan Hunt Glaze, Prop Stylist: Shell Royster, Food Stylist Jennifer Wendorf This protein-packed chicken piccata casserole brings all the flavors of classic chicken piccata together in one dish. It’s the easiest piccata you’ll ever make—no dredging or sauce required! Cooking the lemon slices in butter mellows their bite and helps jump-start the lemony flavor of the dish while helping the butter get a little brown, bringing some nuttiness to the dish. View Recipe 10 of 20 Lemon-Garlic Chicken Casserole Photographer: Morgan Hunt Glaze, Prop Stylist: Shell Royster, Food Stylist Jennifer Wendorf This chicken and rice casserole packs in the protein plus offers plenty of fiber from brown rice and broccoli for a well-rounded meal in one pot. Chicken thighs are meaty and tender, but feel free to swap them out for chicken breast if you prefer. View Recipe 11 of 20 Spanakopita-Inspired Chicken & White Bean Casserole Photographer: Carson Downing, Food stylist: Annie Probst, Prop Stylist: Joseph Wanek This is a fun take on spanakopita, with a creamy feta-and-spinach filling and a crispy phyllo topping. Chicken and white beans pack in the protein. Any white beans, such as cannellini, garbanzo or navy beans, work well here. View Recipe 12 of 20 Creamed Spinach & Chicken Casserole Fred Hardy, Food Stylist: Ruth Blackburn, Prop Stylist: Shell Royster Creamed spinach and chicken combine in this crowd-pleasing, comforting casserole. Crushed red pepper packs some heat, so add less or leave it out completely if you want a milder version. You can cook long-grain brown rice ahead of time or look for packaged microwaveable brown rice to use instead. View Recipe 13 of 20 Salmon Noodle Casserole Photographer: Brie Goldman, Food Stylist: Charlie Worthington This salmon noodle casserole is filled with creamy pasta, chunks of salmon and plenty of vegetables for a well-rounded meal. Dijon mustard flavors the dish, complementing the salmon and asparagus. View Recipe 14 of 20 Chicken Enchilada Skillet Casserole Jacob Fox This simplified take on cheesy chicken enchiladas only requires one pan for cooking and eliminates the need to stuff and roll corn tortillas. Charring the veggies in a cast-iron skillet adds depth of flavor. Don't worry if you don't have one, because you can use any oven-safe skillet instead. View Recipe 15 of 20 Cheesy Black Bean & Quinoa Skillet Casserole Rachel Marek This Southwestern-inspired one-skillet casserole is stuffed with quinoa and plenty of fresh vegetables. Sharp Cheddar cheese flavors the filling and adds a layer of ooey-gooey melted cheese on top. View Recipe 16 of 20 Creamy Mushroom, Chicken & Asparagus Bake This comforting weeknight casserole recipe features plenty of mushrooms and asparagus combined with chicken and brown rice and a creamy Parmesan cheese sauce. Whip this up anytime you have leftover chicken or cooked brown rice to spare. View Recipe 17 of 20 Cheesy Roasted Eggplant Skillet Casserole Ali Redmond Layers of tender eggplant, creamy white beans, ricotta and marinara combine to create a flavorful skillet casserole. Serve this hearty casserole directly from the skillet for a fun presentation. Pair with a side salad for a complete meal. View Recipe 18 of 20 Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce with Kale Ali Redmond You can make these three-ingredient tomato-simmered eggs with things you probably already have on hand in your freezer and pantry. To make these baked eggs more like eggs in purgatory, look for a spicy tomato sauce and don't forget some whole-wheat bread for dipping. View Recipe 19 of 20 Cheesy Chicken & Cabbage Casserole Diana Chistruga This cheesy chicken and cabbage casserole is creamy and briny with plenty of savory flavors thanks to sauerkraut and kielbasa. Gruyère (or Swiss) cheese adds a nutty flavor to the dish, while rye breadcrumbs on top give it a hint of caraway and a nice crunch. View Recipe 20 of 20 Chicken, Quinoa & Sweet Potato Casserole Christine Ma This protein-loaded chicken and sweet potato casserole dish is made with multicolored quinoa, a blend of white, red and black varieties, but any color will work.
