  "text": "Life on the Line: A Survivor Becomes a Voice of Hope LANSING, Mich. (WILX) - As part of our “[You’re Not Alone](https://www.wilx.com/news/not-alone/)” mental health series, we present the story of Liz Baker, a crisis counselor who answers the calls of people in distress and whose personal journey fuels her dedication to saving lives. Baker’s work is focused on one mission: preventing suicide. As a trained crisis counselor, she provides emotional support to people struggling with thoughts of ending their lives. Baker is the Secretary of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Her full-time job is answering the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. “One of my favorite moments is when callers realize that what feels like the end of the world isn’t, and they still have a life to live,” she said. “You can hear it click in their voice.” Baker takes calls from people who find themselves in very dark places—a place she knows well. Personal Trauma Turned Purpose “What was once pain, misunderstanding, and not knowing, turned into purpose,” she said. That purpose grew from personal trauma. When she was just 17, Baker lost one of her best friends, Desmond, to suicide. After receiving a distressing text from him, she and her mother rushed to his house, where they arrived just as he took his own life. “We got there before the first responders. I’ll never forget it. My mom had to hold me back from seeing him.” Her friend’s tragic death left Baker with painful questions: “What could I have done? Could I have stopped it?” These questions led her to the “Out of the Darkness Walk” organized by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in Lansing’s Sharpe Park. In a powerful moment, she felt the hand of a former teacher on her back, a comforting reminder that suicide affects many people, even those we least expect. “Seeing someone so prominent in the community touched by suicide was an ‘aha’ moment,” she said. This revelation fueled Baker’s commitment to helping others. She has since chaired the same walk and now serves as the chapter’s Secretary. Facing Her Own Struggles However, three years into her advocacy, she faced her own struggles with suicidal thoughts. “I felt like a fraud, preaching mental wellness while struggling to use those tools myself.” In her darkest moment, Baker picked up the phone and called the same lifeline she now works for. Talking with someone outside her situation helped her see things differently. “I thought I was protecting my family by keeping them out of it, but I realized it would only bring them pain.” After hospitalization and a period of recovery, Baker discovered a sense of purpose in her own experience. Making Desmond Proud Her mission is now driven by her journey, as she tells callers, “I’ve worn the same shoes, and you can get through this, just as I did. There’s something so powerful about taking my lived experience to show someone, ‘I’ve been there, and you can get out too.’” Through her work, Baker honors Desmond’s memory, knowing he would be proud. “He would be glad to know his story has launched something that helps countless others. I carry him with me every day.” If you or someone you know is struggling, call the 988 hotline. The service is confidential, and if you have a plan, call 911.
