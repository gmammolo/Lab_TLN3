  "text": "A new study has unveiled the first roadmap for developing genetic therapies for ultra-rare diseases affecting only one person worldwide. Led by the University of Twente researcher Anneliene Jonker, this initiative brings hope to millions suffering from extremely rare genetic disorders. The roadmap aims to make personalized treatments scalable, potentially revolutionizing approaches to both ultra-rare and more common conditions. By tailoring therapies to each individual’s genetic profile, researchers are paving the way for a future of customized medical care.\nUltra-rare diseases, defined as conditions affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 individuals in the European Union and less than 200,000 people in the U.S., present unique challenges due to their rarity and the specific genetic mutations that cause them. With approximately 7,000 rare diseases impacting around 400 million people globally, the need for targeted treatments is immense. Yet, less than 5% of these conditions have specific medicinal treatments available.\nThe rise of N-of-1 therapies The concept of N-of-1 therapies is pioneering individualized treatment for patients with rare diseases. These therapies focus on genetic variants specific to each patient, allowing for personalized medical care. This approach is not only groundbreaking but essential, as traditional drug development pathways are not designed for such highly individualized treatments. The roadmap developed by Jonker and her team aims to streamline the creation of these bespoke therapies, making them more accessible and effective.\nAn example of this innovative approach is the personalized therapy developed for a young girl with Batten disease (CLN7). Batten disease is a group of fatal genetic conditions that affect the body’s ability to eliminate cell waste, leading to progressive symptoms over time. Scientists mapped her specific genetic mutation and created a tailored treatment within a year, demonstrating the potential of N-of-1 therapies.\nBreakthrough in embryo selection: new test detects genetic disorders A revolutionary test that detects serious genetic defects in embryos with 99% certainty has been developed in Maastricht. The potential for broader application While the initial focus is on ultra-rare diseases, the techniques developed could eventually support more common conditions as well. Anneliene Jonker compares this to custom-fitting braces to one’s teeth, emphasizing the potential to tailor treatments to each person’s unique genetic makeup. This not only benefits those with ultra-rare diseases but also advances personalized genetic treatments across a wider spectrum of disorders.\nDespite the promise of N-of-1 therapies, significant challenges remain. Developing these therapies requires overcoming scientific, regulatory, and ethical hurdles. The traditional drug development and reimbursement pathways must evolve to accommodate these individualized approaches[2]. The roadmap aims to address these challenges, providing a structured path for the development and implementation of these therapies, ensuring they can reach those in need.\nThe development of the N-of-1 roadmap is a collaborative effort involving the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) and numerous researchers worldwide. As more is understood about the genetic underpinnings of these conditions, the potential for effective treatments grows, offering hope to patients and their families.",
