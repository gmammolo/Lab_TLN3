Everybody was healthy in my family. It was like, ‘What am I complaining about?’” he said. “I didn’t know. I couldn’t pinpoint it to anything.”\nIt was only when Morris’ then-girlfriend him change his diet and encouraged him to become more active that he noticed his mood had “shifted”\nIt was only when Morris’ then-girlfriend helped him change his diet, cooked him healthy foods and made him “fresh juice in the morning” that Morris noticed his mood had “shifted”. “Before I know it, those [depressive] days are over,” he said.\nMorris added that he can now look back on working with Prince, who died two years after making his New Girl cameo, with fondness.\n“There was so much fanfare around it and so much mystique around him,” he said. “And when you meet him, you’re like, ‘I see why. This man is illuminating. And he’s got so many tassels and zippers.’”\nHe continued: “He was so nice and just soft-spoken and very kind and gentle in the way he would talk to people. So that was a really cool experience.”\nJust last week, fellow New Girl star Hannah Simone revealed that Prince only agreed to a cameo on the show because he had a “crush” on her .",
