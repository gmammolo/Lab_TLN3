  "text": "Camarillo Airport Plays Vital Role in Fighting Mountain Fire\nWidespread blaze began on Wednesday morning and quickly grew, pushed by Santa Ana winds.\nCamarillo Airport (KCMA) in Ventura County, California, is playing a vital role in the efforts to extinguish the Mountain Fire. The wildfire began on Wednesday morning and quickly grew, pushed by Santa Ana winds.\nThe airport is being used as a base for the aerial defense aircraft, which may increase to 28 in all by this evening, according to Ventura County spokesperson Jannette Jauregui.\nFire officials held a press conference Thursday morning, describing the blaze as 0 percent contained as of 11 a.m. PST. The airport is not directly threatened by flames, but that could change, Jauregui said.\n- READ MORE:\n[This Unit Is Always Fired Up and Ready](https://www.flyingmag.com/this-unit-is-always-fired-up-and-ready/)\nAccording to officials, water-dropping helicopters worked throughout Wednesday evening, which is unusual for fires of this nature. In addition to the helicopters, hundreds of fire trucks were on site pumping water on the flames.\nThe resources come from several government agencies, including the Ventura County Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), U.S. Coast Guard, Orange County Fire Department, Los Angeles County Fire Department, and Coulson Aviation, in addition to local law enforcement.\nJauregui said smoke is a major challenge because it reduces visibility, which hampers the flight crews.\n\"There is a TFR [Temporary Flight Restriction] in place, and the airport will be closed to nonemergency aircraft through Wednesday of next week to allow emergency crews to safely navigate the airspace,\" she said. \"This closure will allow emergency response aircraft—helicopter and fixed wing—to utilize Camarillo Airport as a base for all firefighting aerial units.\"\nShe added that the county is in communication with airport tenants to keep them apprised of the situation.\nThe TFR is in place through November 13 but may be extended.\n\"Conditions will continue to be impacted by Santa Ana winds, which are expected to continue through this afternoon,” Jauregui said. “Oxnard Airport [KOXR] is currently outside the TFR and remains open.\"\nOfficials reported last night that the fire was moving southwest. By Thursday morning, it began to move east as the winds shifted. Fire crews are focusing on protecting human life and structural defense as embers from the flames are being carried more than 3 miles by the winds and landing in the tinder-dry conditions.\nMore than 14,000 evacuation notices have been issued, and several buildings have been lost to the fast-moving wildfire. As of Thursday afternoon, exact numbers are not available, as fire officials noted the situation remains \"active and unpredictable.\"\nNo injuries have been reported at this time.\nSign-up for newsletters & special offers!\nGet the latest FLYING stories & special offers delivered directly to your inbox",
