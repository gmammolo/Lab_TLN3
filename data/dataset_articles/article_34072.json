  "text": "Guwahati : The North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences ( NEIGRIHMS ) in Shillong has achieved a significant milestone in cardiac surgery, performing East India’s first-ever Bo-Yang Y-Incision Aortic Annular Enlargement Surgery.\nThis innovative procedure offers improved outcomes for patients with severe aortic valve disease.\nDeveloped in 2021 by Prof. Bo Yang of the University of Michigan Health, the Bo-Yang Y-Incision technique addresses a critical issue with traditional aortic valve replacements.\nResearch has shown that traditional methods often undersize the valve by 5-7 mm, significantly reducing the valve opening and leading to faster wear and tear.\nThe Bo-Yang Y-Incision surgery overcomes this challenge by allowing for aortic root expansion. This enables the implantation of a valve 3-5 sizes larger, resulting in improved blood flow, increased valve durability, and potentially better patient survival rates.\nThe successful surgery was performed by Dr. Reuben L. Kynta, Associate Professor of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery (CTVS) at NEIGRIHMS .\nHe was ably assisted by Dr. Tabang Nyitan and Dr. Neelmajingbha Sun, both Assistant Professors of CTVS, and Dr. Priyanka Dev, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology.\nPerfusion support was provided by Perfusionists Mr. Mrinal Mandal and Loosar Dkhar, alongside the skilled staff of the CTVS-OT and CTVS-ICU.\nProf. Nalin Mehta, Director of NEIGRIHMS, lauded the achievement as a significant advancement in cardiac care.\nHe highlighted that the new technique allows for the implantation of an artificial valve with a similar or larger opening than the patient’s native valve, avoiding the undersizing issues associated with traditional methods.\nProf. Mehta said this accomplishment underscores NEIGRIHMS’ commitment to providing the most advanced cardiac surgical care for patients in the region.",
