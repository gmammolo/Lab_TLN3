  "text": "TAYLOR — State officials joined area pharmacists Thursday morning to tout the value of vaccines as the holiday season approaches. During a vaccination clinic at the Taylor Community Center on South Main Street, Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Debra Bogen and Department of Aging Secretary Jason Kavulich urged residents to get their annual vaccinations against the flu, COVID-19, and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), if applicable. Health care providers recommend flu and COVID-19 vaccinations for people six months and older; older adults and pregnant women are encouraged to get RSV vaccinations. Infants and toddlers can receive Nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody that prevents serious cases of RSV, Bogen said. Vaccinations are especially important for high-risk groups including people 65 and older, people with certain medical conditions, and those at a higher risk of developing complications from respiratory illness, health officials said. Bogen and state Rep. Bridget Kosierowski, D-114, Waverly Twp., were among those who were given vaccines at the community center. “It’s been a little over a month since respiratory virus season officially kicked off and with the holiday season approaching, it’s a great time to make an appointment with your health care provider or pharmacist to make sure you’re up to date with your vaccinations,” Bogen said. “It’s been unseasonably warm lately, but it will get cold soon and when we will all go indoors, that’s where infections spread more readily. It’s important for all of us to take basic precautions because it protects ourselves, our families and our community.” Bogen noted vaccines provide protection against severe disease by boosting our body’s defenses against germs that make us sick and informed people they may get the flu, COVID and RSV vaccine at the same time. The severity of respiratory illnesses, as the winter progresses remains to be seen, but Bogen stressed getting vaccinated is the best way to limit the spread. “We’re ready for whatever comes our way,” she said. “It’s always hard to predict exactly what’s going to happen, but every year we ask the same, get your flu vaccine, your COVID vaccine, and RSV, if you’re eligible and it’s appropriate.” Bogen added the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released new guidelines, suggesting those 65 and older and people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive a second dose of the COVID vaccine six months after their initial dose of the updated vaccine. Tom DePietro, owner of DePietro’s Pharmacy in Dunmore, advises patients to keep in touch with their health care providers amid the constant changes. “These recommendations change so frequently and it can be very confusing,” he said. Kavulich, who previously served as director of the Lackawanna County Area Agency on Aging, lauded the volunteers for making senior community centers vibrant places. “They’re really the lifeblood of our communities,” he said. “We need to continue to invest in them and make sure they stay strong and remain as a place for older adults to gather. They have all forms of information flowing out into the community from a central point where people come to socialize and put things aside.” Sara McDonald, director of the Lackawanna County Area Agency, offered several resources for older adults to find information about getting or scheduling vaccines. Older adults can schedule in-home vaccinations by calling 570-963-6740, she said. “We also work closely with our nine senior center managers to ensure that they are collaborating with local pharmacies to host vaccination clinics in the centers,” McDonald said. “We rely on a senior center directors because they work independently with the pharmacy and share the dates with their participants.”",
