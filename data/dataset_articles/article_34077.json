  "text": "01 October 2024 | News\nPlans to hire over 300 new employees at the Sejong site to support this expansion\nimage credit- shutterstock\nUS-headquartered SK pharmteco, a global contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), has announced a major expansion of its small molecule and peptide production capabilities with a $260 million investment to construct a new state-of-the-art facility in Sejong, South Korea.\nScheduled to begin operations in late 2026, the new facility will be the fifth plant the company opens in South Korea and will be a cornerstone of SK pharmteco’s global manufacturing network.\nSpanning 135,800 square feet, it will feature eight production trains with an output of tens of metric tons annually. This investment also includes state-of-the-art peptide R&D facilities, CGMP kilo labs, and CGMP pilot plant for peptide manufacturing. These resources can support early-stage clinical and commercial production with great flexibility.\nLastly, the investment also includes building the shell for a sixth manufacturing plant, which will allow a quick expansion of capacity in the future.\nSK pharmteco plans to hire over 300 new employees at the Sejong site to support this expansion. Joerg Ahlgrimm, CEO of SK pharmteco said, “By investing in this new facility, we’re increasing our capacity in Asia in line with our global expansion strategy and solidifying our position as a trusted partner for companies developing groundbreaking treatments, demonstrating our adaptability and reliability in a rapidly changing industry.”",
