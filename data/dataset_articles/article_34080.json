  "text": "A novel vaccine can mobilize the immune system to precisely target and attack cancerous brain tumors, specifically gliomas, one of the deadliest brain tumor types. This groundbreaking work demonstrates that the body’s immune system can be directed to target proteins with cancer-driving mutations in tumors, marking a significant advance in immunotherapy. Clinical trials have confirmed that this approach, which focuses on the IDH1 mutation present in many gliomas, is both safe and effective. This achievement was honored with the “Breakthrough of the Year 2024” award, recognizing its potential for wide-reaching impact in cancer treatment. Key Facts: - Researchers designed vaccines that direct the immune system to target the IDH1 mutation, crucial in many gliomas. - Trials have shown these vaccines to be safe and capable of generating targeted immune responses. - This precision immunotherapy could lead to broader applications across various cancers. Source: DKFZ Michael Platten’s research has a major goal: He wants to advance the cure of one of the deadliest forms of brain tumors, known as gliomas. His work has shown that the immune system of patients can be mobilized with the help of novel vaccines against this form of cancer. The body’s own defenses are then able to take very precise action against modified proteins that drive tumor growth. Michael Platten will be honored for his groundbreaking findings with the “Breakthrough of the Year 2024” award from the Falling Wall Foundation in Berlin on November 9, 2024. Platten is head of the Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumor Immunology at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and director of the Department of Neurology at the University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM). Since October, Platten has also been president of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO). His involvement in clinical practice is an essential element of Platten’s scientific success: “My inspiration comes primarily from the patients who struggle with this devastating disease every day,” says Platten. He believes it is of central importance that scientists develop solutions that bring real, tangible improvements to people’s lives, the cancer researcher continues. Breaking the wall of brain tumor vaccines Clinical trials have already confirmed that his idea of activating the immune system with the help of vaccines against tumor cells works. In these trials, the vaccines proved to be safe and effective. The proof that his vaccine can trigger a targeted immune response in a patient’s brain tumor was a breakthrough moment for him, says Platten. Precision tumor therapy What makes Platten’s findings so special is the precision with which the immune system can attack cancer cells after activation by the novel vaccines: it recognizes tiny differences between normal proteins and those with cancer-causing mutations in their blueprint. His team has discovered that the so-called IDH1 mutation in particular plays a key role in many gliomas. This mutation occurs in almost 70 percent of low-grade, or slow-growing, gliomas. The immunotherapy developed by Platten targets precisely this IDH1 mutation in order to generate a broad and effective immune response that encompasses all tumor cells, even if they differ genetically from one another. Cancer cells can thus be eliminated very specifically. Application not only against brain tumors Using advanced bioinformatics and molecular biology tools, his team has developed specific cellular immunotherapies that can potentially be used not only against brain tumors but also against other types of cancer. The idea behind this is that the identified mutations are present in all of a patient’s tumor cells, which is crucial for the vaccines to be effective. Platten also wants his research to inspire the next generation of scientists. His advice to young researchers is: “Be brave, ask questions, work in teams and share your knowledge. And if necessary, don’t be afraid to break into completely new fields of research.” Falling Walls Science Summit 2024 The title “Falling Walls Science Breakthrough of the Year” is awarded annually. It recognizes the most significant scientific breakthroughs in various categories of the Falling Walls Global Call. The winners present their groundbreaking work to a global audience at the Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin on November 9, 2024. Michael Platten is one of ten winners in the Life Sciences category and ultimately the winner of the Breakthrough of the Year 2024 in the Life Sciences.
