  "text": "World's First Enhanced Small Particle (ESP™) Detection Sorter Enables Effective Content Isolation; Opens Door to Scientific Discoveries\nFREMONT, Calif., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cytek Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTKB) has introduced an Enhanced Small Particle (ESP™) Detection Option for its Cytek Aurora™ CS system . This is the first commercially available small particle detector on a cell sorter and offers a significant advancement for rapidly evolving research fields, including in drug delivery, cell therapy, disease diagnostics, circulating tumor cells, regenerative medicine, and vaccine delivery. Researchers can now achieve downstream analysis of materials that were previously unable to be sorted, opening new possibilities for breakthroughs in these areas.\nOnce regarded as cellular debris, exosomes and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are now recognized as pivotal to cell-to-cell communication, disease progression, and therapeutic delivery. With the surge in research interest driven by technological innovations, EVs have become central to a growing body of scientific publications and clinical trials. With Cytek's ESP Detection Option, particles as small as 70 nm can now be studied and sorted for downstream analysis, giving researchers the ability to characterize the full emission spectra of small particles.\n\"As the first company to offer the ESP Detection Option on a cell sorter, we are setting a new standard for small particle research,” said Ming Yan, Ph.D., CTO of Cytek Biosciences. \"The enhanced capabilities of our Cytek Aurora CS system not only push the boundaries of scientific discovery but also may open up new markets for Cytek. Researchers can now explore areas previously beyond their reach, accelerating both scientific progress and potential commercial opportunities.”",
