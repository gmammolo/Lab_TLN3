  "text": "Lake Oswego, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lake Oswego, Oregon -\nWith seasonal allergies affecting millions of people across the United States, many individuals considering LASIK eye surgery are left wondering whether their allergy symptoms might interfere with the success of the procedure. In response to these concerns, Tersigni Vision has published an in-depth article addressing the question: \"Can I get LASIK if I have seasonal allergies?\" The article aims to provide clarity for potential LASIK candidates who struggle with allergies, offering expert advice and helpful information to guide them in making informed decisions about their vision correction options. The article can be found on the Institute website: https://www.tersignivision.com/lasik/can-i-get-lasik-if-i-have-seasonal-allergies/\nSeasonal allergies, which are often triggered by pollen, dust, and other environmental allergens, can cause eye irritation, itching, and watering-symptoms that may cause apprehension for individuals considering laser vision correction. Dr. Steven Tersigni, a leading LASIK surgeon at Tersigni Vision, reassures patients that, despite these concerns, LASIK is a safe and effective option for those suffering from allergies. The key, according to Dr. Tersigni, lies in the careful timing of the procedure and proper management of allergy symptoms during the recovery process.\nThe article explains that patients with seasonal allergies can undergo LASIK, but it is advisable to plan the procedure during periods when allergy symptoms are less active. This reduces the likelihood of post-operative discomfort, such as dry or irritated eyes, which can occur if the surgery is performed during peak allergy season. By scheduling LASIK at a time when allergens are less prevalent, patients can experience a smoother recovery and avoid complications. Tersigni Vision emphasizes the importance of working closely with a qualified LASIK surgeon who can evaluate individual circumstances and recommend the best course of action.\nOne of the standout points in the article is the potential benefit of LASIK for allergy sufferers who wear contact lenses. Contacts can trap allergens against the surface of the eye, often worsening allergy symptoms. For individuals who struggle with both allergies and the daily inconvenience of wearing contacts, LASIK offers the opportunity to eliminate the need for lenses altogether. By reducing dependence on contact lenses, patients may also find relief from allergy-related discomfort, as fewer allergens will be in direct contact with their eyes. The possibility of not having to deal with the irritation caused by contacts during allergy season is one of the many reasons why LASIK is an appealing option for those with allergies.",
