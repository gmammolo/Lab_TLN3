  "text": "A California man knew just what to do when he was called about a hibernating black bear beneath a home in Lake Tahoe: He shot the animal with a paintball gun. Toogee Sielsch is a nature enthusiast who shares his various outdoor exploits on Instagram . On Tuesday, Sielsch was summoned to deal with a squatting bear that had forced its way into the crawlspace beneath a house. He brought a video camera with him. The footage he shot shows Sielsch cautiously peeking into the hole the bear made to access the crawlspace. Armed with a paintball rifle, he then crawls into the hole with the bear, and disappears. It isn't long before the sound of shots starts, and the startled 500-pound bear comes tearing out of the crawlspace. The stunned animal runs off, out of the camera's view. Sielsch said on Instagram that he tries to raise awareness to the urbanized black bear population in the area. He said he recognized the bear, and that he hadn't seen the animal in over a month. \"I had to evict him from under an occupied house that he ripped into,\" Sielsch wrote on Instagram. \"I promise he's just fine, and will surely find another safer spot to over winter.\" Sielsch adds that viewers should not \"even THINK about doing what I did there unless you have YEARS of training and experience.\"",
