  "text": "The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) has announced the results of the Digital Health Most Wired Survey for the 2024 data-collection period. Door County Medical Center (DCMC) has announced its Level 8 achievement for the Acute and Ambulatory survey selection.\nAmong the almost 48,000 facilities represented, DCMC ranked above peers in critical categories such as analytics and data management, population health, infrastructure and patient engagement. The survey evaluates the adoption, integration and impact of technologies across healthcare organizations, from early-stage adopters to industry leaders.\nIn the face of escalating challenges like increasing cybersecurity threats, evolving care models, staffing shortages, and budget constraints, the urgency for improving healthcare through technology continues to grow. The Digital Health Most Wired survey and recognition program serves as a comprehensive digital health checkup for healthcare organizations globally.\n“To aid your future planning, we have designed the Digital Health Most Wired program to provide insights into best practices, HIT [health information technology] adoption patterns and digital health market trends,” CHIME President and CEO Russ Branzell said.\n“This achievement is a true reflection of our dedicated IT team and our entire organization, who continually embrace digital technologies to support our caregivers and ensure high-quality patient outcomes,” DCMC Chief Information Officer Erick Schrier said.\nDCMC has consistently improved its performance on the Most Wired survey since 2019, when it was rated at a level 5. It is difficult for small or rural hospitals to even earn a spot on the Most Wired listing, according to Schrier, since they do not always have the financial means to support technological improvements.",
