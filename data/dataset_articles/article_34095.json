  "text": "TAYLOR, Pa. — 'Tis the season, flu season that is, as seniors rolled up their sleeves at the Senior Community Center in Taylor.\n\"That's the main reason we're here. You don't want to end up in a hospital. You don't want to end up being ill with a respiratory infection,\" said Rep. Bridget Kosierowski.\nThe PA Department of Health sponsored Thursday's free vaccine clinic. DiPetro's Pharmacy in Dunmore provided free flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines.\n\"As we get older, we become more susceptible to respiratory infections. So, because of that, we need to be more proactive and remain healthy,\" said the Pennsylvania Secretary of Health, Dr. Debra Bogen.\nWhile flu season started about a month ago, in October, the Department says it's still the perfect time to get your vaccinations, with the holidays approaching.\n\"It may not seem like it, but it will get cold soon, and we will all go indoors, and that is a time where infections spread more readily,\" explained Bogen.\nRita Stravinskas of Taylor is taking advantage of Thursday's clinic to protect herself for the season.\n\"Being a nurse, I know how important getting the shots are. I really, since they have started giving the COVID shots, we've received everyone they have given. We got our RSV. We get out flu every year,\" said Stravinskas.\nThe CDC says it's important to encourage your loved ones with you to do the same.\n\"I encourage my husband, Stan. He always goes with us. Where I go, he goes. So, we always get them together,\" said Stravinskas.\nThe PA Department of Health suggests flu and COVID vaccines for everyone 6 months and older. But this year, they suggest an RSV vaccine for everyone 75 and older. All three vaccines can be given at the same time.\n\"RSV usually in most people causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But it can be very serious in the very young and the very old. But it can lead to hospitalizations at high rates,\" added Bogen.\nWith the similarities in symptoms surrounding the three respiratory illnesses, the PADOH also stressed the importance of testing.
