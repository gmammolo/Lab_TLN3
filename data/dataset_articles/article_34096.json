  "text": "Social-clinical music programs designed for people with mild-to-moderate neurocognitive disorders will be held in Sturgeon Bay and Fish Creek.\nThe Musical Museum program is a collaboration between Midsummer’s Music affiliate, the Griffon String Quartet, Third Avenue PlayWorks (TAP), and Clara Takarabe, a violist and clinical music researcher with the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University.\nClara Takarabe.

They are suitable for those with mild to moderate disorders like dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body dementia, stroke, frontotemporal degeneration and head trauma.\n“We have long intuited the healing power of music and art, and Clara’s research at Northwestern University is proving the scientific efficacy of music in the healing process,” said Jacob Janssen, the Jackie and Steve Kane Artistic Director at TAP. “We are honored to be one of the hosts for her work here in Door County.”\nJacob Janssen. Submitted. The Musical Museum program, along with other Griffon String Quartet programs for older adults, was partially funded by a grant from the Little Eddie Big Cup Mental Health Awareness fund of the Door County Community Foundation.\nThe first Musical Museum event will take place Nov. 13, 2 pm at TAP’s Steve and Jackie Kane Theatre, 239 N. 3rd Ave. in Sturgeon Bay. The second will be held Nov. 14, 2 pm at Peninsula School of Art, 3900 Cty F in Fish Creek.\nDonations will be accepted. Call 920.854.7088 or visit midsummersmusic.com for more information.",
