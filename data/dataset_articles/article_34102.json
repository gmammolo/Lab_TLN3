  "text": "Moshe Fisher-Rozenberg has detailed his second album as [Memory Pearl](https://exclaim.ca/artists/memory_pearl). The [Absolutely Free](https://exclaim.ca/artists/absolutely_free) drummer will share Cosmic-Astral on January 31 via [Boiled Records](https://www.boiledrecords.com/). Following 2020's [Music for 7 Paintings](https://exclaim.ca/music/article/absolutely_free_moshe_fisher-rozenberg_debut_album_memory_pearl_music_for_seven_paintings), the nine-song Cosmic-Astral is Fisher-Rozenberg's take on re-composing a \"music program\" used by psychotherapists in the 1970s in conjunction with LSD. The original music program sought to take the listener on a cosmic journey of personal discovery through submersion in classical, romantic works by Strauss (Also Sprach Zarathustra), Scriabin (Poème de l'extase), and Holst (Neptune). A release notes that the exercise — its \"demanding, complex and unpredictable\" sounds recommended for \"experienced trippers\" — was eventually removed from circulation for being too confrontational. Fisher-Rozenberg, by comparison, sought to create a score \"more delicate and tender\" through prioritizing the connection between sound healing and the psyche. He's enlisted a host of tonal titans to achieve this, including [Joseph Shabason](https://exclaim.ca/artists/joseph_shabason), [Alvvays](https://exclaim.ca/artists/alvvays) guitarist Alec O'Hanley, [Sam Prekop](https://exclaim.ca/artists/sam_prekop), Bram Gielen, [Mas Aya](https://exclaim.ca/artists/mas_aya) and Moritz Fasbender. \"Astral Travel\" is the first of Cosmic-Astral's compositions to arrive, and as Fisher-Rozenberg notes, it marks the moment \"where the album arch begins to soar.\" Let the song's vocal synth, foundational Rhodes chords and Shabason's spectral sax move you via the player below. Cosmic-Astral: 1. Prelude 2. Relaxation Induction 3. Music Travel I 4. Astral Travel 5. Music Travel II 6. Music Travel III 7. Music Travel IV 8. Music Travel V 9. Postlude",
