  "text": "by Tanya Gazdik , 65 minutes ago For Lamborghini, November is synonymous with Movember, a month dedicated to raising awareness about men's health. For the fourth consecutive year, the automaker has developed various initiatives aimed at engaging customers and enthusiasts to draw attention to the charitable organization, contributing to the prevention and treatment of often overlooked male health issues.\nMovember was founded in London in 2003 with the goal of supporting activities raising awareness of men’s health around important issues such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide.\nThe association invites anyone wishing to support these causes, even symbolically, to grow a moustache during November as a gesture of solidarity.\nThis year, Lamborghini x Movember \"Bull Run\" involving owners began in Miami. More than 150 Lamborghinis belonging to customers from seven Florida dealers paraded the city's streets. With unmistakable mustache decals on the hoods, the cars traveled through some of the city's most scenic locations, spreading the Movember message and ending the route in Miami Beach.\nadvertisement\nadvertisement\nOther events this year include an interactive installation hosted at the Lamborghini Museum in Italy. Following a “moustache trail” from the museum entrance, visitors will reach a dedicated area featuring a Lamborghini adorned with a moustache and a container filled with nuts.\nVisitors can make a donation to Movember to participate in the game, trying to guess the exact number of nuts in the container. The visitor who guesses correctly or gets closest to the correct number will win an Automobili Lamborghini backpack.\nAnother activation includes the racing video game developed by Gameloft. Until Nov. 14, players of Asphalt Legends Unite can purchase a special Movember-themed livery with a moustache for the Revuelto and Huracán STO models directly from the in-game store, created specifically for this initiative.",
