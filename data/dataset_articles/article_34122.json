  "text": "The Orihuela Council has proposed to the Generalitat a plot of land of 12,000 square meters between Calle Beduinos and Calle J’Alhamed, in the sector H-1 Villa Rosa, Punta Prima, for the construction of a second health centre on the coast although the conselleria continues to favour the extension of the Centro Salud in Aguamarina.\nHowever, a recent letter from the Generalitat Valenciana, to the neighbourhood organisation Unidos por la Costa, showed that they remain firm in their intention to expand the Aguamarina facility.\nThe association, which defends the need for both actions, has addressed a question in plenary to clarify what is currently being negotiated with the conselleria with the mayor responding on Wednesday, arguing that the council is working with the Valencian Department of Health to build a second health centre on the coast, since, as he explained, “the expansion would be insufficient.”\n“The negotiation is still underway, and it is also on the right track,” he said. He confirmed that the council has now offered the Valencia Consell the necessary building land, a plot of 12,000 square metres in the sector H-1 Villa Rosa de Los Altos, located between Calle Beduinos and Calle J’Alhamed, not too far from the plot originally offered by a previous mayor Emiliano Bascuñana in La Ciñuelica.\nA year ago, the Orihuela council rejected the expansion and reform of the current Orihuela Costa health centre, which was waiting for the drafting of the plans after the transfer of the adjoining car park plot. Instead, it called for the construction of a second health centre that, would better respond to the current health needs of the Oiolano coast.\nIn response to the Unidos por la Costa letter, the conselleria wrote that, “at present, the extension project is temporarily paralysed, since the property situation of the plot where it is planned to carry out the expansion of the centre is pending regularization .” It added, “we know that the City of Orihuela is carrying out the necessary efforts to resolve this issue as soon as possible.”",
