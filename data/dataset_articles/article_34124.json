  "text": "Getting Deep\nPopular Austin deep massage clinic opening new location near Westlake\nA gentle massage can be lovely, but some stressed Austinites need some extra oomph. They can get it at AustinDeep, a local massage clinic that specializes in a propriety technique called the Deep Method. There will soon be a third location in the Barton Creek neighborhood — the farthest outside of Austin and the largest so far.\nThe [new location](https://www.instagram.com/p/DBg6i2QPzDy/) will be at 2700 Barton Creek Blvd., Ste. 110. It'll span 3,000 square feet at the Barton Creek Village, which is near the Barton Creek Country Club, St. Michael's Catholic Preparatory School, and the Barton Creek Greenbelt. This is a new market for the brand, since the existing two locations are relatively close to each other on Congress Ave and Lake Austin Boulevard.\nMasseuse Jessica Price developed a proprietary technique for AustinDeep.Photo courtesy of AUSTINDEEP\nThe Deep Method targets the fascia, the connective tissue that holds our muscles and other organs together. Ideally, the fascia should be flexible, but sometimes it gets tight from inactivity, overuse, or other issues, causing pain or soreness. When masseuse Jessica Price opened AustinDeep in 2002, she used her background in myofascial release — a very gentle technique — to create a new process that starts with a warming technique, and then adds in deep tissue and trigger point therapy.\nThe result is more rigorous and may leave clients sore afterwards. As AustinDeep practitioners [explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kRm2CUaOVU), breaking up all that fascia is an intense workout, even though the therapist is doing much of the work. Price also learned from physical therapists, so this exacting approach that prioritizes results makes a lot of sense.\nThat might not sound relaxing (and fans of any intense massage techniques will confirm that they usually aren't), but the aftermath is where things start to open up. This clinic calls it getting \"Massage Drunk.\"\nClients may leave feeling drunk.Photo courtesy of AUSTINDEEP\nDespite a tough-love massage approach, the new location sounds cushy: There will be 10 therapy rooms with electric lift tables; a lounge with relaxing music and a bar for tea, wine, or even custom flower arrangements; a veranda to enjoy nootropic drinks (brain supplements) or wine; and a retail selection.\nThe interior design also reflects the departure from the potentially sterile massage clinic norm with lots of plants and jewel tones.\nSo far there is no opening date set, but AustinDeep is sharing updates when they're available on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/austindeep). Services start at $85 for 30 minutes. More information is available at [austindeep.com](https://austindeep.com/services/).",
