  "text": "Dreamers eligible for health insurance through Covered California for first time this year Dreamers in the Golden State are able to sign up for a health plan through the [Covered California](https://www.coveredca.com/) healthcare exchange for the first time this year. Due to a [federal rule change](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/current) earlier this year at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, eligible recipients of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) can sign up for a health plan and receive financial help if they qualify. “HHS is committed to making health coverage accessible for people DACA recipients – Dreamers – who have worked hard to live the American dream. Dreamers are our neighbors and friends; they are students, teachers, social workers, doctors, and nurses. More importantly, they are fellow Americans,” [said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, in a statement announcing the rule change earlier this year](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/05/03/hhs-finalizes-policies-increase-access-health-coverage-daca-recipients.html). “More than one-third of DACA recipients currently do not have health insurance, so making them eligible to enroll in coverage will improve their health and wellbeing and help the overall economy.” As a result of this rule, DACA recipients and other newly eligible individuals will qualify for a special enrollment period to select a health plan through the Marketplace during the 60 days following the rule’s Nov. 1 effective date. The timing also corresponds with the 2025 Open Enrollment Period, which will help ensure that newly eligible individuals are able to enroll in coverage. Eligible DACA applicants can get coverage as soon as Dec. 1, if they apply in November To facilitate the process, Covered California set up a special enrollment period from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, to help DACA recipients get health and dental insurance for the rest of 2024 year if they sign up in November. Coverage could start as soon as Dec. 1. To sign up, applicants select the “gained lawful presence” option from the list in the special enrollment period section when applying. The special enrollment period overlaps with Covered California’s regular open-enrollment period, which means DACA recipients can also sign up for health and dental insurance for 2025 during this time. What is DACA? DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is a policy established in 2012 that enables eligible undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children to avoid deportation and receive a Social Security number, work permit and driver’s license to live and work legally in the States. DACA approvals are valid for two years at a time. To be eligible for DACA, an applicant must have been younger than 31 years old on June 15, 2012, or born on or later than June 16, 1981, and have adhered to other residency, education, and security requirements. How many DACA recipients are there in California? California has the most active DACA recipients of any state in the United States, with 164,320 as of 2023, [according to US Citizen and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/data/Active_DACA_Recipients_March_FY23_qtr2.pdf). Texas has the second most DACA recipients at 95,430. There are 578,680 total DACA recipients across the United States.",
