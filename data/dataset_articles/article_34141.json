This innovative program is set to empower seniors by employing advanced technology to help enhance their balance and cognitive abilities through engaging activities. What Makes the Brain and Balance Center Unique? The Brain and Balance Center distinguishes itself by featuring three cutting-edge technologies: the RAPID Balance Mat System, the S3 Balance device, and SMARTfit. These tools offer a holistic approach that aims to improve not only the physical health of residents but also their mental well-being. As Lisa Dickenson, Director of Fitness and Wellness, states, \"Nobody has the three pieces of technology that we have or a Brain and Balance Center. Many places focus solely on balance or cognitive health, but we combine both aspects in one program.\" State-of-the-Art Technologies for Better Health The RAPID Balance Mat System is instrumental in establishing a baseline for each resident's balance capabilities. It provides personalized exercises tailored to improve their skills progressively. The S3 Balance device, an innovative stand designed for stability, allows residents to confidently engage in balance training. This fosters a sense of safety while enhancing their overall physical strength. Moreover, SMARTfit brings brain training exercises into the mix, reinforcing the understanding that cognitive and physical fitness are deeply interconnected. Measurable Results from Participation Residents who participated in the program for two months reported significant progress, achieving an average balance score improvement of 20%. This remarkable outcome reflects the effectiveness of the program, especially considering that many were already active in maintaining their balance. Lisa emphasized, \"For them to show such improvement in such a brief time was truly impressive.\" This provides clear evidence that the combination of cognitive and physical exercises yields tangible health benefits. Collaboration for Broader Impact The Brain and Balance Center is also joining forces with the Front Porch Center for Innovation and Wellbeing to create a comprehensive program that can extend into other Front Porch communities. This collaboration aims to empower more seniors by promoting healthier and more fulfilling lifestyles across various communities.
