What Jules discovered was that as women aged, the body’s ability to regulate blood glucose levels diminished, leading to a cascade of issues such as energy dips, food cravings, mood swings, and sleep disturbances.\nThis, in turn, affected motivation to exercise and make healthy food choices, creating a vicious cycle.\nThis discovery resulted in Jules creating the Metabolism & Energy Superblend to help women feel [more energetic, balanced and in control of their health.](https://go.linkby.com/NRGXBFBH/products/metabolism-energy-superblend?variant=44751605629106)\nTo find out more and to try it for yourself, head to Pure Goddess’s [website here.](https://go.linkby.com/NRGXBFBH/products/metabolism-energy-superblend?variant=44751605629106)",
