  "text": "Myfanwy Schostakowski was about six weeks pregnant when she went to her first pregnancy ultrasound at the end of 2022.\nSchostakowski, of Sydney's Eastern Suburbs, and her husband Benjamin had been trying for about two years to add to their family following the birth of son George in 2017.\nWhen tests confirmed she was pregnant, Schostakowski decided to have an ultrasound two weeks later after becoming convinced she was having twins, despite there being no family history of multiple births .\nBut as the sonographer waved the wand over her stomach, Schostakowski realised something was amiss.\nREAD MORE: 'Best friend's dad's name': The new baby name trend set to take off in 2025\nMyfanwy Schostakowski with her triplets soon after their birth. (Supplied) \"We were with the sonographer and she said, 'Is this natural or IVF?' and 'Do you have any other children?'\" Schostakowski recalled.\n\"Then she starts wiping all the gel off [my stomach] after only a couple of minutes and said, 'I am going to leave the room and grab my colleague.'\"\nFearing the worst, ﻿Schostakowski begged the sonographer for more information.\n\"I said, 'If there is no heartbeat, you have to tell me,' and she said 'No, there are three heartbeats, I think it's triplets.'\n\"Then I just remember my husband nearly fainted and said 'Triplets!' in this high-pitched voice.\"\nREAD MORE: Queen Elizabeth's final diary entry revealed\nThe ultrasound that showed Schostakowski was having triplets (Supplied) Schostakowski, who suffered from gestational diabetes during her previous pregnancy, said her mind raced with fears about her health and that of her unborn babies in the moments that followed.\nWithin hours of the ultrasound, she received a call from The Department of Maternal-Foetal Medicine (MFM) at the Royal Hospital for Women in Randwick.\nThe unit provides integrated multidisciplinary care to women experiencing a high-risk pregnancy.\n\"They rang and said, 'We know you found out today you are pregnant with triplets. How are you?'﻿\" Schostakowski said.\n\"I found out on a Friday and they just said, 'You need to take the weekend to process it and we will talk to you again on Monday.'\"\nREAD MORE: The one place Prince William says he can 'be himself'\nThe Sydney mum with husband Benjamin and son George shortly before she gave birth to triplets. (Supplied) By early in the new year, they had mapped out a plan to proceed with the pregnancy, which was deemed high-risk.\nN﻿atural spontaneous triplets occur one in every 10,000 pregnancies. About half will be born before 32 weeks, and require treatment in a Neonatal or Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU).\n\"All the scenarios were explained. It was all very transparent about the risks,\" Schostakowski said.\nThe pregnancy was closely monitored, with monthly, then fortnightly and finally weekly appointments, with scans sometimes taking 3½ hours.\n\"Everything was explained at every part of their development. How they were measuring, their weight,\" she said.\n\"It was very stressful. Mental health is such a big part of any pregnancy but with a high-order multiple birth, more so.\" ﻿\nSchostakowski weighed more than 100kg and her skin would itch and burn. (Supplied) Schostakowski's health was also closely monitored. Her gestational diabetes was eventually managed with insulin, as her weight ballooned by more than 30 kilograms.\n\"We were never aiming to get to 40 weeks. We were hoping to get to 30 weeks and the maximum was 35 weeks,\" she said.\nAs the weeks went by, and the delivery date drew closer, social workers warned Schostakowski about what to expect.\nNurses also buoyed her spirits when she felt like she couldn't go on.\nFinally, when ﻿Schostakowski was approaching 33 weeks, a decision was made to admit her to hospital to administer the steroids needed to strengthen the babies' lungs ahead of their delivery, which was planned for later that week.\nThe triplets soon after their birth in the Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick. (Supplied) When the day finally arrived, Schostakowski walked herself to the elevator and then the operating suite where an elective caesarean was scheduled to take place.\nInside, she found a team of about 30 people waiting to deliver and care for the triplets.\nShe was able to stay calm by \"thinking about all the team around me.\"\nThe top 10 names for boys and girls in the US revealed View Gallery The couple elected not to learn the sex of the babies, who were born within two minutes of each other on June 15, 2023, at 33 weeks and two days' gestation.\nFirst was Ophelia, then Violet, and finally Ivy. While the two eldest suffered respiratory distress and were immediately whisked away, Ivy, the smallest of the trio, was able to have a quick cuddle in her mother's arms.\nHours later﻿, Schostakowski was reunited with her daughters in the hospital's NICU, where they spent two days before being moved to the special care nursery.\nMyfanwy Schostakowski with her triplets. (Supplied) They went home, on the same day, five weeks later.\nSchostakowski is speaking about the care she and her daughters received to support The Royal Giving Day on Wednesday, November 13, to raise much-needed funds for The Royal Hospital for Women.\nAs the only dedicated women's hospital in NSW, it plays a critical role in the health and well-being of women and newborn babies, but relies heavily on community support to fund state-of-the-art equipment, research and programs.\nIn fact, 80 per cent of the specialised medical equipment in the hospital's Newborn Intensive Care Unit was funded by donations.\nThe triplets are now 16 months old. (Supplied) These include the lifesaving humidicribs and CPAP machines used by the triplets.\n\"My girls needed that and if they didn't have access to that, they wouldn't be the healthy children they are now,\" Schostakowski said.\nThe 12-hour telethon style event is organised by the Royal Hospital for Women Foundation and has raised more than $750,000 since it was first held in 2021.\nThis year is extra special as it marks the hospital's 30th anniversary.﻿ All donations made by the public on the day will be matched by corporate donors.\nNine's Alex Cullen will host the event, which will be attended by former Aussie tennis player Casey Dellacqua, past and present Matildas players Nicola Bolger, Leigh Wardell and Julie Murray, Sydney Swans chief executive Tom Harley and his wife Felicity, Sydney Swans players and former hurdler Jana Pittman, who is now a doctor at the hospital.\n\"If they didn't have access to [the NICU's specialised equipment], they wouldn't be the healthy children they are now.\" (Supplied) Foundation chief executive Elise Jennings said funds raised on day support the hospital's work.\n\"All donations – big or small – make a real difference to the lives of the women and newborns we care for here at the Royal,\" she said.\nMore than 4000 babies were born at the hospital in the past year, while 10,000 women used the hospital's services, which include everything from maternity to oncology.\nYou can support the hospital here .﻿\nFOLLOW US ON WHATSAPP HERE : Stay across all the latest in celebrity, lifestyle and opinion via our WhatsApp channel.
