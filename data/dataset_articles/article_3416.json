  "text": "PESHAWAR: Mardan City Mayor Himayatullah Mayar emphasized that preventing domestic violence is a shared responsibility within society. He noted that a lack of awareness about rights contributes to this issue, underscoring the need for media programs focused on women’s rights and the enforcement of relevant laws. Speaking at a dialogue on domestic violence organized by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan at TMA Hall, Mayor Mayar highlighted the importance of good behavior and high morals, as advised by Islam. Read [Woman’s head forcibly shaved by husband](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2450982/womans-head-forcibly-shaved-by-husband) He pointed out that ignorance of laws and limited knowledge of rights often lead to incidents of domestic violence. Mayor Mayar called for an active role by the media in addressing and preventing domestic violence. He emphasized that marriage, as a contract between a man and a woman, necessitates a clear understanding of their respective roles, urging both parties to play a positive role.
