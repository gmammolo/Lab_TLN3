  "text": "Summary: Certain gut bacteria may play crucial roles in aging, with implications for promoting healthier aging. Research conducted on over 200 octogenarians found a decline in key bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and a compensatory increase in other species that help maintain gut health.\nThese changes impact inflammation, blood sugar, and vitamin levels, suggesting gut bacteria as potential markers for aging. Researchers are now investigating whether these bacterial shifts could be harnessed for therapeutic formulations aimed at enhancing health in aging populations.\nKey Facts:\nGut diversity decreases with age, impacting critical functions for gut health. Loss of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii prompts an increase in other butyrate-producing bacteria, supporting gut health. Some bacteria correlate with key health markers, like blood sugar and vitamin levels, making them potential indicators of healthy aging. Source: ASTAR\nA new study has revealed that gut bacteria may play a key role in aging, and that specific microbes could be targeted to promote healthy aging.\nThe Nature Communications study was conducted by scientists from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research Genome Institute of Singapore (A*STAR GIS), in collaboration with researchers from the A*STAR Singapore Immunology Network (A*STAR SIgN), A*STAR Institute for Human Development and Potential (A*STAR IHDP) and the National University of Singapore (NUS).\nAging is a complex, multi-factorial phenomenon with progressive decline in several physiological functions. As Singapore faces a rapidly growing aging population, researchers are seeking ways to understand the aging process and identify key lifestyle and dietary factors to encourage healthy aging.\nAs part of this effort, the team conducted the first large-scale study on over 200 octogenarians (people aged 80 – 89) in Singapore.\nTheir investigation revealed how the gut microbiome changes with age, highlighting key microbial species associated with aging, and their potential effects on health.\nUsing advanced DNA sequencing, the research team discovered a significant decrease in gut bacterial diversity as individuals age.\nA particularly noteworthy finding was the decline of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , a crucial bacterium responsible for producing butyrate—an essential short-chain fatty acid that maintains gut health, reduces inflammation, supports gut barrier function, and facilitates gut-brain communication.\nResearchers observed an increase in Alistipes and Bacteroides species, with Alistipes utilising alternative substrates from Bacteroides to generate butyrate.\nThis notable switch may compensate for the reduction of F. prausnitzii , enhancing the metabolic capacity of the elderly gut to produce butyrate and promoting healthier aging.\nThe team then turned to preclinical models of healthy aging to validate their findings from the human cohort.\nDespite differences in the microbes present in different host species, the researchers made a surprising discovery that they had remarkably similar functional enrichments, particularly in pathways related to butyrate production.\nThis indicates that although the specific microbes may differ across species, the functional roles they play in fostering healthy aging may be similar.\nAdditionally, the research team examined the association between gut bacterial changes and health markers such as inflammation, blood sugar and vitamin levels.\nThey identified Parabacteroides goldsteinii , a promising probiotic species associated with fasting blood glucose levels, as well as key gut species like Streptococcus parasanguinis and Bacteroides coprocola , which were linked to serum Vitamin B 12 levels, suggesting that these bacteria may serve as indicators for monitoring healthy aging.\nRecognising the potential of these associations, the researchers envisaged the development of non-invasive tests for frailty based on gut bacteria analysis.\nIn the next phase of their research, the team plans to further investigate the identified microbial strains and their metabolic pathways. By using preclinical testing, they aim to explore how these findings can be potentially translated into formulations that promote healthy aging.\nAarthi Ravikrishnan, the lead scientist of the study from A*STAR GIS, commented, “Our research offers key insights into the unique aspects of the gut microbiome and the metabolic shifts associated with aging.\n“This study opens exciting new avenues for exploring the biology of aging, with a particular focus on populations in Asia.”\nAssociate Professor Niranjan Nagarajan, Associate Director, Genome Architecture, and Senior Group Leader, Laboratory of Metagenomic Technologies and Microbial Systems at A*STAR GIS, added, “Our findings lay the groundwork for future research aimed at developing targeted probiotic and prebiotic therapies to enable healthy aging through gut microbiome modulation.”\nDr Wan Yue, Executive Director at A*STAR GIS, commented, “This study has unveiled a better understanding and characterization of the gut microbiome in our local aging population and the potential biomarkers or probiotics unique to the Asian population that can improve healthy aging and to identify individuals at risk for aging-associated diseases.\n“This can serve as a useful marker for early detection of diseases and interventions, improving patient prognosis.”\nAbout this microbiome and aging research news Author: Shu Chian Tay\nSource: ASTAR\nContact: Shu Chian Tay – ASTAR\nImage: The image is credited to Neuroscience News\nOriginal Research: Open access.\n“ Gut metagenomes of Asian octogenarians reveal metabolic potential expansion and distinct microbial species associated with aging phenotypes ” by Aarthi Ravikrishnan et al.
