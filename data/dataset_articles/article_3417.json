Preliminary data from over 175 cities indicates the country likely experienced an estimated 12% decline in homicides from 2022, according to data analysis firm [AH Datalytics](https://www.ahdatalytics.com/). FBI [figures](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/quarterly) through September reveal that most other crimes — besides [car theft](https://themessenger.com/news/report-car-thefts-are-on-the-rise-in-2023) — also saw a drop this year, per AH Datalytics co-founder [Jeff Asher](https://jasher.substack.com/p/crime-in-2023-murder-plummeted-violent), who previously worked as a crime analyst for the CIA. \"The quarterly data in particular suggests 2023 featured one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the United States in more than 50 years,\" Asher wrote in a recent blog post. But those figures don't match public perception: An October [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/544442/americans-crime-problem-serious.aspx#:~:text=More%20than%20three%2Dquarters%20of,readings%20in%20the%20respective%20trends.) found that more than three-quarters of Americans believe there were higher rates of crime this year, compared with the year before. Fifty-five percent think crime in their local area has gotten worse, too, mirroring how the public felt in both 1981 and 1992.

Philadelphia, meanwhile, saw a 21% drop year-over-year. The picture [wasn't rosy](https://themessenger.com/news/homicide-rates-are-the-highest-in-these-us-cities-report) for every city though. Washington, D.C. saw an estimated 36% rise in homicides, while Dallas saw a 14% spike, Axios [reported](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/28/us-murder-violent-crime-rates-drop). Gun control advocates attribute at least some of the national decline to the bipartisan [Safe Communities Act](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/16/gun-violence-deal-one-year-on/70298825007/), passed in June 2022. That law made gun trafficking a federal crime and added domestic violence offenders to the national criminal background check system, among other regulations meant to keep firearms out of the hands of violent people. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco told [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/homicide-numbers-poised-hit-record-decline-nationwide-americans/story?id=105556400) closer cooperation between federal and local authorities likely contributed to the decline as well. \"We're using tools like crime-gun intelligence, the ability to trace the gun and the spent shell casing from a crime scene to identify who's that shooter, how many violent crimes have they been involved with,\" Monaco said. Unlike most other crimes, motor vehicle theft rose by about 10% between Q3 2022 and 2023, at least partially due to a viral security flaw in [Kias and Hyundais](https://themessenger.com/business/hyundai-looks-to-educate-more-owners-to-prevent-theft-of-its-vulnerable-models) that made some models especially easy to steal. Murders rose by nearly [30%](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/27/1040904770/fbi-data-murder-increase-2020) in 2020 during the pandemic — the largest annual spike since at least the 1960s. The rate stayed roughly the same in 2021 before dipping slightly in 2022. \"Most of the surge in murder that occurred in 2020 and 2021 has abated across the country,\" Asher wrote. While murders almost certainly \"plummeted\" this year, they still remain slightly higher than in 2019. The FBI won't release a finalized tally until late next year. But Asher said it's important to publish the preliminary estimates because they stand in stark contrast with public perception. \"In a sane world this new information would change how we talk about crime nationally, releasing people from the myth of a national and unending crime wave,\" he wrote.
