Of course, to get the most out of these products, you have to use them consistently, which often requires a substantial financial investment. But what if you could find an affordable pet CBD option that was just as effective and pure as the high-priced brands?\nThat’s exactly what the Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets from HempLucid appears to be. This oil is highly concentrated, USDA-certified organic, made from US-grown hemp, and costs a fraction of what the leading pet CBD oil brands do.\nSo, does it work? That’s the question my dog Papyrus and I set out to answer. I have been testing this affordable oil on him for the last three weeks and have been largely impressed with the results. Keep reading to find out if this CBD product is worth the purchase in my full HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets review.\nOverview\nCheck Price on HempLucid Product Type: Pet CBD oil Best Suited For: Pets with anxiety, sleep problems, pain issues, and more Price Range: Very affordable Ingredients: Organic hemp seed oil, chicken flavoring, organic full-spectrum hemp cannabidiol oil, bacon flavoring Concentration: 10mg CBD per ml (300mg CBD per bottle) Options: Chicken flavor – 30ml Spectrum: Full-spectrum hemp oil Storage: Refrigerate after opening Recommended Dose: ½ to 3 droppers, depending on weight Our Experience\nMy fifteen-year-old Chihuahua, Papyrus, has dealt with anxiety his entire life. When I first discovered CBD oil, I felt like I had stumbled on a miracle cure. But dosing my chronically anxious boy twice a day, every day, gets expensive.\nThat’s why I’m always on the lookout for more affordable pet CBD oil options. Of course, these oils also need to be high-quality and effective. This is exactly what HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets promises, which is why I knew I had to test this product out.\nPapyrus was certainly up for the challenge after going without CBD for the last month. Now, after three weeks on HempLucid, he is back to his happy, less anxious self. There is certainly a lot to love about this product as well as some downsides.\nAs far as pet CBD oils go, this one checked an awful lot of boxes. It’s made with organic hemp seed oil and CBD oil, it’s GMP-certified, and the hemp used is grown in my home state of Colorado.\nThis is also a full-spectrum product, which means it has a lot of extra cannabinoids, like CBDV, CBG, and CBC, that help to strengthen the effects of CBD. Of course, this also means it has trace amounts of THC in it. Luckily, though, at around 0.05%, this product is well below the maximum recommended THC percentage for pet products.\nAt 10mg of CBD per dropper, this product has about the perfect concentration for the therapeutic dosing of small and medium dogs.\nPapyrus gets a fairly high dose for a seven-pound Chihuahua, usually around 4 mg twice per day. This equates to just under half a dropper, which is an easy amount to dose and doesn’t add too much extra oil to his diet.\nAs far as getting that dose into him, I found that to be fairly easy as well. I simply added the oil to his breakfast in the mornings and dropped it onto a treat before bedtime to help with his old-man night anxiety.\nOf course, hands down, my favorite part about this oil is the price. This product costs less than many non-organic, low-concentration pet CBD oils that I’ve tried. Considering the quality, amount of CBD per bottle, and purity, it truly is a steal.\nOne unique thing about this organic oil is that it contains two flavor enhancers, chicken and bacon. Despite this, Papyrus was not exactly sold on the taste.\nHe had no problem eating it along with his meals, but he was not a fan of direct dosing. In fact, he was even skeptical about eating his bedtime treat when I put the oil on it. So, if you have a finicky eater, expect to have to mix this oil with their food despite the fact that it’s flavored.\nMy only other big gripe about this oil is that the dropper does not have measurement markers. Since a full milliliter (which is equal to one “dropper full”) is actually ¾ of a dropper, it is hard to eyeball anything less than a full dose. The glass pipette is great, but it would be better if it had markers for pain-free measurements.\nOverall, though, I was very impressed with this oil. It helped bring Papyrus’ anxiety levels down as well as many of the premiere brands we’ve tried but it costs almost half as much as those do. Considering the price, quality, and effectiveness, I would highly recommend this product.\nPros & Cons Pros Organic ingredients Full-spectrum Good concentration for most dogs Third-party lab tested Hemp seed carrier oil Highly affordable Cons No measurement markers on dropper No other concentration options No other flavor options\nKey Features\nCheck Price on HempLucid Made with Quality Ingredients HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets combines USDA organic hemp seed oil with full-spectrum CBD oil for enhanced wellness.\nHemp seed oil, naturally rich in flavonoids and terpenes, is an ideal carrier oil that boosts the effectiveness of CBD. Meanwhile, full-spectrum CBD oil contains minor cannabinoids that work together to maximize CBD’s benefits for the body. Both oils are certified organic, ensuring your pet enjoys a pure, pesticide-free product.\nMade with Hemp Clones Uniquely, HempLucid relies on hemp clones to create their products. Don’t worry, we’re not getting into scary GMO territory here. Rather, these plants are propagated by rooting out branches cut from an established plant.\nThis method of propagation yields an entire crop of hemp plants with the exact same amounts of important compounds, such as CBD. This leads to products that perform the same way bottle after bottle. This means, that if HempLucid works well for your pet, you can count on it to continue to produce the same results every time you use it.\nSurprisingly Affordable This pet CBD oil is among the most budget-friendly options I’ve come across, even outperforming many non-organic products in terms of price. If your dog suffers from chronic issues that require daily dosing, such as anxiety, pain, or neurological disorders, HempLucid offers an affordable and effective solution that’s hard to beat.\nAbout HempLucid\nHempLucid , which got its start in 2016, aims to create quality human and pet CBD products using only US-grown hemp.\nManufacturing: All HempLucid CBD products are made in the USA Sourcing: They source their hemp from organic Colorado farms USDA Organic: Since 2020, HempLucid has maintained USDA-organic certification Testing: All products are third-party independent lab tested Quality Ingredients: No fillers or diluters Is HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets a Good Value? This product stands out for its excellent pricing, especially compared to other quality, organic brands. It’s even more affordable than many non-organic pet CBD oils. And by joining HempLucid’s subscription program, you can enjoy an extra 5% savings on this already budget-friendly option.\nHow We Tested I tested this product by using it as my dog’s only CBD supplement for just over three weeks.\nDuring that time, I used multiple dosing options to get a sense of its ease of use. While Papyrus was not a big fan of straight dosing, he did accept treats with the CBD oil on them. But, by far, I found the easiest option for giving him HempLucid was to add it to his meals.\nDuring this time, I took diligent notes about Papyrus’ anxiety levels, including making notes about the frequency of his nighttime pacing and sleep disturbances.\nAfter about a week, I noticed significant improvements in his symptoms. He seemed much less reactive during the day and slept soundly most nights. This improvement has continued for the last couple of weeks as I’ve continued using the product.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Can I give this product every day? Yes, you can. Thanks to HempLucid’s quality ingredients and third-party verified purity and concentration, you can feel safe giving this product to your pet every day.\nHow much THC is in this product? This full-spectrum product includes less than 0.3% THC, the highest level generally recommended for pet products. Recent lab testing shows the actual THC content is much lower, closer to 0.05%.\nIs this product just for dogs? No, this pet CBD oil can also be used for cats and many other pets. Since some animals are more sensitive to CBD and THC than others, always talk to your vet before starting your pet on CBD.\nCheck Price on HempLucid\nConclusion If you’re searching for an affordable, organic pet CBD oil that delivers real results, HempLucid Organic Full-Spectrum CBD for Pets is a great choice.\nThis USDA-certified organic oil is not only highly effective but also priced lower than many non-organic options out there. Better still, it’s easy to dose, packs a generous amount of CBD, and is made with quality ingredients that produce consistent results to help your pup get relief from anxiety , pain, and more.",
