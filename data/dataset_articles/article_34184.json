  "text": "The redevelopment of the Northern Integrated Care Service (NICS) building has commenced as part of the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) Precinct Masterplan. Jointly funded by the Australian and Tasmanian Governments, this $5.1 million redevelopment will help establish the LGH as a national centre of research excellence supported by the Clifford Craig Foundation (CCF). As part of the redevelopment, a new Research and Innovation Centre will be established at the NICS building in collaboration with CCF, while the Sir John Ramsay Memorial Library will also be relocated to the Centre. Importantly, relocation of the research and library facilities into the NICS building will benefit research activities and create additional space for clinical services within the main hospital building. Initial works on the Ground Floor will create office, meeting, and breakout spaces for staff before progressing to Level 1, where the research facilities and library will be located. Minister for Health, Jacquie Petrusma, said the redevelopment of the facility would significantly enhance Tasmania's health research capabilities. \"The start of works on the Northern Integrated Care Service building is an exciting milestone, which is part of the 10-year $647.5 million Launceston General Hospital Redevelopment,\" said Minister Petrusma. \"This redevelopment will help establish the LGH as a national centre of research excellence, growing our capacity for advancing medical research and innovative healthcare on a national and global scale. \"As part of the 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, we are committed to building an even better health system, and our LGH Redevelopment will provide world-class facilities for Tasmanians.\" Federal Senator for Tasmania, Helen Polley, said the redevelopment will greatly benefit the northern Tasmania community. \"It's great to see this important redevelopment get underway, which will improve opportunities at the LGH for research and clinical trials,\" Senator Polley said. \"This project will ensure our healthcare professionals can continue to do world-class research right here in Tasmania.\" Clifford Craig Foundation Chief Executive Vanessa Cahoon said the start of works was a significant step forward. \"At Clifford Craig, we are committed to enhancing the northern region's capacity to attract and retain medical professionals to do their important work right here,\" Ms Cahoon said. \"Seeing the commencement of material works after securing investment in northern region healthcare infrastructure is exciting for our community.\" The NICS will remain operational during construction, which is expected to be completed by mid-2025.[]https://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/?_kx=h7NnZ_qZRz1BM07Rc_5U3taQ1_mYc4EjA-OxmKq_fro.TidPmQ [here](/northern-integrated-care-facility-construction-1352901/).",
