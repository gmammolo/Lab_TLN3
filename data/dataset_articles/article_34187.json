  "text": "T-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30\nNovember 7, 2024 - American Hockey League (AHL)Springfield Thunderbirds News Release\nSPRINGFIELD, Mass. - The Springfield Thunderbirds are proud to announce that, for a second straight year, the club will wear specialty purple jerseys on Saturday, Nov. 30, at 4:05 p.m. against the Hartford Wolf Pack for the annual Hockey Fights Cancer game.\nIn addition to the return of the specialty jerseys, the team will continue its commitment to Bitsy's Army, a charitable cause established in 2021 by Thunderbirds forward Sam Bitten. Bitten tragically lost his cousin Martin Piche that year to a cancerous brain tumor at age 31, and ever since the Bitten family has been raising money and awareness for brain cancer research in their native Canada.\n\"With Sam Bitten back under contract with the Thunderbirds for two more seasons, it made too much sense as an organization to continue supporting a cause so close to the Bitten family's hearts,\" said Thunderbirds President Nathan Costa. \"We have no doubt our amazing fans will stand behind Sam in this endeavor, and we hope to top last year's donation totals in the name of finding the cure.\"\nLast season, following an inspiring 7-0 T-Birds win on Hockey Fights Cancer Night, which featured two goals by Will Bitten and the first AHL point of Sam Bitten's career, the T-Birds raised $26,000 toward cancer research via the postgame jersey auction. Portions of the proceeds were donated to the Brain Tumour Foundation of Canada, Bitsy's Army, and various cancer charities local to Springfield.\n\"Our family is so grateful to the entire Thunderbirds organization and the fans for the unbelievable support of Hockey Fights Cancer and Bitsy's Army over the years,\" said Sam Bitten. \"Maintaining Martin's legacy is deeply meaningful to us, and we hope his story can continue inspiring others who are going through the fight.\"\nFans attending the Hockey Fights Cancer game will also have the opportunity to purchase Hockey Fights Cancer and Bitsy's Army merchandise, the proceeds of which will also directly benefit brain cancer research.\nTickets for Hockey Fights Cancer can be purchased by calling the T-Birds at (413) 739-4625 or by visiting www.SpringfieldThunderbirds.com.\nSpringfield Thunderbirds Statistics\n• Discuss this story on the American Hockey League message board...\nAmerican Hockey League Stories from November 7, 2024\nT-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30- Springfield ThunderbirdsFive Goals by Griffins Secure Win over Iowa- Grand Rapids GriffinsWranglers Lead Battle of Alberta Series- Calgary WranglersGrand Rapids Scores Final Three Goals in 5-2 Iowa Loss- Iowa WildDelicious New Deals for Belleville Sens Fans Coming on Pizza Hut Fridays- Belleville SenatorsCapitals Loan Mike Sgarbossa to Hershey- Hershey BearsPanthers Assign Justin Sourdif to Charlotte- Charlotte CheckersWolf Pack Weekend Preview: November 7th, 2024- Hartford Wolf PackSilver Knights Sign Defenseman Lucas Johansen- Henderson Silver KnightsT-Birds Sign F Matt Luff to AHL Contract- Springfield ThunderbirdsBid Now on Hockey Fights Cancer Player-Used Sticks- Rockford IceHogsStars Reassign Goaltender Ben Kraws to Idaho- Texas StarsTransaction: Sawyer Boulton Recalled from Reading- Lehigh Valley PhantomsMonsters Sign Defenseman Grant Gabriele to Pro Tryout Contract- Cleveland MonstersMoose Unveil 25th Season Celebration Jersey- Manitoba MooseSchool Day Game, Military Appreciation Night Upcoming for Griffins- Grand Rapids GriffinsAnnual Hockey Fights Cancer Night Set for Saturday, November 16 against Laval- Rochester AmericansHartford Wolf Pack Community Foundation Opens Grant Application Process, Announces Numerous Changes to Board- Hartford Wolf PackReign Score Early, Double up Abbotsford- Ontario ReignCanucks Fall 8-4 against the Ontario Reign to Conclude Their Roadtrip- Abbotsford CanucksThree-Goal Second Period Leads Firebirds to Victory over Eagles- Coachella Valley FirebirdsFirebirds Rally for 3-2 Victory over Colorado- Colorado EaglesCondors Shutout by Calgary- Bakersfield Condors\nThe opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it, and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff.\nOther Recent Springfield Thunderbirds Stories\nT-Birds to Wear Specialty Jerseys in Support of Bitsy's Army for Hockey Fights Cancer Night on November 30T-Birds Sign F Matt Luff to AHL ContractPeca Leads T-Birds' Comeback Triumph over IslesT-Birds, Springfield City Library to Expand Boomer's Reading Club for 2024-25 SeasonPhantoms Escape Ferocious Thunderdome with Triumph",
