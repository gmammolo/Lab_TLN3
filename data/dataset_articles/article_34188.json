  "text": "Dan Netter//November 7, 2024//\nThe Twin Cities metro is home to some of the strongest and largest medical technology and device companies in the nation, drawing strength and talent not only from the medical institutions of the area, but also from the nearby Mayo Clinic in Rochester.\nThe medtech industry’s presence is fueled not only by companies like 3M, Medtronic and Boston Scientific but also by mid-sized companies and small shops, according to one JLL Life Science executive.\nTravis McCready, JLL’s Head of Life Sciences for the Americas, said there are two trends in the metro (and Rochester) that make it a strong market: a highly skilled workforce and the number of companies located here.\n“The middle market is also importantly what’s driving the ecosystem,” he said in an October interview with Finance & Commerce.\nIn an analysis of the life science sector and its respective subsectors, including medtech, biomanufacturing, AI and talent, the Twin Cities metro was second only to Los Angeles as the area with highest concentration of groups — companies, hospitals, nonprofits — taking part of medical technology industry, a recent report from JLL showed.\nWhile it remains prominent in the medtech subsector, the metro fails to show up in the top five cities for any of the other subsectors, the report shows. McCready said if businesses and governments want to better position themselves elsewhere in the life science sector, there needs to be a “parallel focus” on biology and biopharma industries. McCready said JLL has recently picked up responsibility for two lab properties in the Destination Medical Center in Rochester where they hope to introduce more biological uses.\n“We are the strongest medtech community and we’re now inviting biopharma uses,” he said. “That’s an incredible global opportunity for us here in the Greater MSP.”\nReal estate space availability and proximity to talent can be important factors for the development of the sector. Michael Flynn, the senior director for Economic Development at the DMC, said real estate is critical for the medtech and health care industry because it’s not space that is in abundance. Something that the DMC focuses on is ensuring that technical and specified spaces exist for the life science industry in Rochester.\n“We think about how we make sure that that type of real estate is developed so we have turnkey space that are available and ready to go for companies that are going through a development process,” Flynn said.\nFlynn also emphasized that this real estate and the companies need an “anchor institution” to be successful.\n“Making sure that real estate is developed proximate to where research is happening, or a clinical or research setting, academic medical center,” he said. “That’s where your talent exists. Obviously if the real estate is very specialized, the talent a lot of times is very specialized as well.”\nHousing remains a persistent issue within the metro and Rochester, though McCready said “every major metropolitan area” is failing to keep pace with housing needs. He says housing is now an endogenous threat for the area.\nRELATED:\nDuPont buys warehouse for $15M as part of Donatelle acquisition\nDavis pays $72M for WestHealth complex in Plymouth\nMinnesota Chamber report cites regulation, housing shortage as holding back state’s growth",
