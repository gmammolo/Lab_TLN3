Make the night before for a healthy breakfast you’ll love waking up to.\nPhoto Credits: Miriam Novoa When I first started the Mediterranean Dish about 10 years ago, the concept of the Mediterranean diet had not quite taken off yet. Nowadays people have a better understanding of what it means to eat the Mediterranean way : Incorporating seasonal produce, healthy fats, whole grains, and lean protein with delicious, joyful meals. But what I still get asked about more than anything is this: What should I eat for a healthy Mediterranean breakfast?\nThe short–and maybe not so catchy–answer is there is no one way to enjoy a Mediterranean breakfast, and I have so many healthy breakfast recipes to choose from. But generally speaking, we tend to go for savory and fresh instead of sweet. We fill our tables with color like we do every meal. We even enjoy salad and Hummus at breakfast!\nSo while this savory yogurt bowl is not a traditional recipe by any means, it certainly has a Mediterranean spirit. I load it with healthy protein, including omega-rich hard-boiled eggs and mineral-packed chickpeas. Then I layer on the flavor and texture with some of my favorite Middle Eastern herb blends, fresh veggies, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.\nIt’s everything I want in a breakfast: perfectly simple and healthy, comes together quickly, keeps me satisfied until lunchtime, and I can prep the night before. You’re going to love it!\nTable of Contents What You Need to Make Savory Greek Yogurt Bowls Ingredient Spotlight Swaps and Substitutions How to Make Savory Greek Yogurt Bowls Ways to Mix it Up What to Serve with a Savory Yogurt Bowl More Mediterranean Breakfast Recipes Savory Yogurt Bowls Recipe What You Need to Make Savory Greek Yogurt Bowls Think of this as more of a template than a full recipe, substituting what you have on hand to keep it interesting. I used:\nGreek yogurt: Any plain yogurt will work, but I like the added protein boost and richness of Greek yogurt. Chickpeas : This small but mighty legume is high in protein, vitamins, and minerals—see the full breakdown at the USDA ). Eggs: Add not only protein but also omega-3 fatty acids and loads of vitamins—the USDA can give you a more in-depth look at eggs as well. Vegetables: I used 2 Roma tomatoes and 2 Persian cucumbers, but any fresh tender veggies that are tasty raw will work here, or you can swap in leftover roasted veggies. Extra virgin olive oil: Adds a touch of richness and flavor. I love a robust finishing oil for this recipe, like our peppery Spanish Hojiblanca . Salt enhances the savory flavor. You can also use flaky sea salt for added texture if you have it. Seasoning: I love a sprinkle of Za’atar and/or Dukkah—see Ingredient Spotlight below for more. Ingredient Spotlight Za’atar and Dukkah may seem like a forgettable finishing touch, but they’re what makes this easy breakfast bowl crave-worthy. It’s the authentic Middle Eastern touch that I’d humbly argue sets this recipe ahead of the thousands of other breakfast bowls on the internet. It’s that final sprinkle of flavor that makes you look forward to your first meal!\nDukkah, with its blend of 3 nutrient-rich nuts and warming spices, is savory and crunchy. Za’atar, with its mix of fragrant wild thyme and tart sumac, leans more aromatic and bright.\nLEARN MORE: See our guides to Egyptian Dukkah (recipe included) and Za’atar . TRY IT: Find my favorite Za’atar at our spice shop . Swaps and Substitutions If your Mediterranean pantry is in need of a refresh, head over to our shop to restock. In the meantime, there are plenty of ways to make this recipe with what you have on hand.\nYogurt: Use hummus for a dairy-free version. You can also play with varieties like sweet and savory Beet Hummus and extra creamy Avocado Hummus . Tomatoes and cucumbers: Anything that will bring you freshness and crunch. Sliced bell peppers, sweet mini peppers, radishes, and fennel all come to mind. Za’atar and/or dukkah: Use any savory seasoning blend you like, such as Italian Seasoning . Fresh tender green herbs like parsley, dill, mint, and cilantro would also work. Ideally, you would get some texture in there too with a sprinkling of nuts and/or seeds. Eggs: This recipe is delicious and protein-rich without the eggs. You can just leave them out. How to Make Savory Greek Yogurt Bowls It only takes 10 minutes or so to make this savory yogurt bowl recipe. The best part? You can make it the night before so busy mornings don’t mean going hungry. Here are the steps:\nGet prepped. If you’re serving with Dukkah and want to make it from scratch , get that all set and cooling. Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas (or follow this recipe and use 1/2 cup of cooked chickpeas.) Hard boil 2 eggs—I have a guide for that too . Chop your fresh veggies (I used 2 Roma tomatoes and 2 Persian cucumbers). Build the breakfast bowl. Add 1/2 cup Greek yogurt to the bottom of two serving bowls. Grate one egg onto each bowl using the largest side of a box grater (or chop them and add). Top with the chickpeas and fresh veggies. Finish and serve. Add a drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil, pinch of salt, and a good sprinkle of za’atar or dukkah. Serve or cover and refrigerate for up to one night. Ways to Mix it Up This Savory Yogurt Bowl recipe is more of a template situation than an actual recipe. If you keep playing with it you’ll never get bored. Some ideas:\nUse a different base: Just about any savory spread works well in place of the yogurt. Hummus or a flavored hummus of your choice, like Beet Hummus , is a great option. Smoky Muhammara or Baba Ganoush would also work well. And if you love Greek yogurt, take it a step further with its extra-strained cousin Labneh . Add more crunch: Top with Crispy Quinoa , or swap out the chickpeas for Roasted Chickpeas . Add Mediterranean goodies : Like olives, sun-dried tomatoes , or roasted red peppers. These Greek olives are my favorite. Give it even more of a savory kick: Grate garlic into the yogurt, and/or mix with fresh herbs. Top with sliced red or green onions. Add heat: Top with harissa, Aleppo pepper or Urfa biber (all of which you can find at our shop ). Or add a fresh kick with Zhoug (Spicy Cilantro Sauce) . What to Serve with a Savory Yogurt Bowl This is a complete meal that should keep you full until lunchtime. You don’t need anything more, aside from perhaps a cup of coffee or Black Tea . If you’re used to sweet breakfasts, add a piece of fresh fruit, or make a fruit salad. I love a citrus salad in the winter and a fresh berry salad during the warmer months.\nMore Mediterranean Breakfast Recipes Breakfast\nSpanakopita Egg Muffins (Easy Egg Bite Recipe!)
