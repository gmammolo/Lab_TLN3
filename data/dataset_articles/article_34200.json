  "text": "You can make your morning coffee extra tasty with “one of the healthiest” supplements, which is also said to promote brain health.\nMost people can’t imagine going about their day without coffee and a lot of them prefer non-dairy alternatives to add to it. That’s why [Starbucks has stopped charging extra](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/starbucks-new-rule-will-save-non-dairy-milk-lovers-10-on-every-order/) for alternative milk, thus reducing the cost of each [drink](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/food-and-drink/) by more than 10%.\nTasty supplement in coffee boosts brain health\nIf you prefer adding a non-dairy alternative to your [coffee](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/coffee/), Dr. Robert Love recommends switching to a tasty supplement that makes you “think better.”\nHe personally uses MCT oil made from coconut, which is great for your brain and body. The healthy supplement also enhances the taste of [coffee](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/coffee/).\nConsuming three tablespoons of MCT oil daily is believed to improve brain performance. The supplement is “turned into ketone bodies” by the liver, which provides energy to your brain in addition to other [health](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/health/) benefits.\n- CAN YOU GUESS? :\n[American can’t believe British McDonald’s doesn’t have UK’s second favorite condiment](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/american-cant-believe-british-mcdonalds-doesnt-have-uks-second-favorite-condiment/)\n[Consuming coffee on an empty stomach](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/health-expert-weighs-in-on-debate-about-drinking-coffee-on-an-empty-stomach/) can cause unpleasant symptoms such as insomnia, nervousness, restlessness, nausea, and increased heart rate.\nHowever, Dr. Robert says you can drink coffee while fasting by including MCT oil or MCT oil power in it.\nCommon mistakes to avoid while preparing coffee\nAlthough a moderate amount of coffee is said to have health benefits, some common mistakes people repeatedly make while preparing can negatively impact the brain.\nAccording to Dr. Robert, coffee is the second on the list of crops grown with the most pesticides. So, he strictly recommends using organic coffee that’s Light Roast with more antioxidants.\nEspresso and French Press are the most commonly used methods to prepare the popular beverage. But the neuroscientist suggests brewing it with the drip method as it’s more effective than the others.\nDr. Robert Love is a neuroscientist, researcher, and educator, who specializes in helping people prevent Alzheimer’s disease with science. He leads a research team investigating a new FDA drug to help reverse Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.",
