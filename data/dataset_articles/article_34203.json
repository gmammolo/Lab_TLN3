  "text": "When you’re looking for an easy dinner idea that you can make in less than 30 minutes and get tons of flavor, this easy baked nachos recipe needs to be on your go-to list!\n(Recipe updated with new photos 3/19/2020.)\nEASY BAKED NACHOS RECIPE\nI often make this recipe with ground beef. If you look at the bottom of the post, I first created it for the site using ground beef. But my family loves chicken nachos too! When it comes to nacho dinner ideas, the easiest thing to do is change out the meat or cheese that you use!\nSo when I remade these sheet pan nachos, I happened to have chicken on hand. But you can use any meat that you want! They’d be great with steak too!\nHOW DO YOU MAKE NACHOS NOT SOGGY?\nMy number one tip on avoiding soggy nachos has to do with the chips you use. Choose chips that are thicker. I love thinner tortilla chips that are more like the ones you get in a restaurant, but they’re not the best for making nachos.\nMy other tip for avoiding soggy nachos is to watch your layering. Making sheet pan nachos is the perfect way to get better nacho layering. With just a single layer of chips, it’s easier to layer everything while still covering every single chip!\nHOW LONG DO NACHOS GO IN THE OVEN FOR?\nYou only need about 5 minutes to cook this nacho dinner recipe. You’re really just looking to melt the cheese.\nHOW DO YOU MAKE PERFECT NACHOS?\nSpreading the chips in a single layer is the key to making the perfect nachos! They’ll stay crispy and every chip will have some delicious toppings on it!\nWHAT CAN I ADD TO NACHOS?\nHere are some ideas for topping your nachos:\n- Cheddar Cheese\n- Monterrey Jack cheese\n- Colby Jack cheese\n- Cheese Sauce\n- Chicken\n- Ground Beef\n- Ground Turkey\n- Ground Pork\n- Shredded Chicken\n- Shredded Pork\n- Steak Strips\n- Rice\n- Black Beans\n- Pinto Beans\n- Refried Beans\n- Charro Beans\n- Onions/Green Onions\n- Black Olives\n- Corn\n- Jalapeños\nToppings to add after baking your nachos:\n- Tomatoes\n- Lettuce\n- Avocado\n- Salsa\n- Guacamole\n- Sour Cream\n- Cilantro\nEASY BAKED NACHOS RECIPE INGREDIENTS\nTo make oven-baked nachos, you’ll need meat (I used chicken when I updated this recipe and ground beef in the original), beans (if desired), rice (if desired), taco seasoning, water, shredded cheese, tortilla chips, and any other toppings that you like to put on your nachos.\nHOW TO MAKE SHEET PAN NACHOS\nBefore you get started on the food, heat the oven to 425°F.\nBrown your meat and drain it. Then add the taco seasoning and water. Cook until the water thickens and the chicken is heated thoroughly.\nWhile the chicken is cooking, drain and rinse the black beans.\nLayer your tortilla chips on a large sheet pan. You only want one layer of chips so use a large enough sheet pan that chips don’t have to pile chips on top of each other.\nLayer your beans on top of the chips. If using rice, layer it next. Then layer the chicken on top of the chips.\nTop the nachos with the shredded cheese. If you’re adding onions or olives, layer them on next.\nBake for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted.\nRemove from the oven and serve with desired toppings. If you’re adding tomatoes, lettuce, or avocado, add it after the nachos are done cooking.\nFor more Mexican flavor that’s easy, try making Crock Pot Chicken Enchiladas or Crockpot Chicken Tacos! You can also make all of these recipes for game day or other entertaining!\nEasy Baked Nachos Recipe\nIngredients\n- 1 lb\nchicken(cut into small pieces) - 1 can\nblack beans(drained) - 1 packet\ntaco seasoning - 2 cups\nshredded cheese tortilla chips- toppings - tomatoes, lettuce, onions, cilantro, avocado/guacamole, salsa, sour cream, etc.\nInstructions\n- Preheat the oven to 400°F.\n- Brown/cook the meat and drain.
