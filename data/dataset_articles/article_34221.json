  "text": "Bathroom cleaning problems now have a simple solution BrandedUp in partnership with [ Domex Philippines ](https://www.facebook.com/DomexPhilippines) A sparkling clean home reflects love and responsibility for many homemakers. However, one challenge they face to achieve this goal is cleaning the dirtiest area of the house—the bathroom. This task becomes daunting when confronted with stubborn stains on metal fixtures and yellow ring discolorations on toilets. These unsightly accumulations are known as “limescale,” which often develop in households that use mineral-rich groundwater. This type of water is high in calcium, magnesium, and other mineral content, which is why it is called “hard water.” As limescale enters the home, it gathers in toilets and other areas causing hard-to-remove stains. The discoloration can worsen due to everyday use. To assist Filipino households in addressing this issue, Unilever Philippines has a specialized cleaning solution designed with hydrochloric acid to help dissolve limescale, the Domex Stain, and Limescale Toilet Bowl Cleaner. Build a safe and germ-free household with Domex At an exclusive media and influencer event organized by Domex in Cebu City, attendees witnessed the science behind the product and learned about the benefits of using a specialized cleaner. “When I started a family, I relied on alternative solutions to be more practical. However, I realized that these alternatives were far more time-consuming and resource-intensive,” says mom influencer Malaya Macaraeg. “This realization prompted me to switch to Domex to avoid laboring for hours.” Danieca Goc-ong (aka content creator DanVibes) also shared how she first tried Domex because her mom recommended it. “She always loved cleaning, that's why she advised me not to settle for general solutions when it comes to cleaning. I remember being surprised when I first tried Domex because it made my cleaning quick and easy!” According to Unilever Homecare’s Research and Development CTI Assistant Manager Lorena Miranda, the Domex Stain and Limescale Toilet Bowl Cleaner, like other Domex products, kills 99.9% of germs based on lab tests on representative bacteria while effectively combating limescale. In recognition of the effort and love homemakers invest in their homes and families, Unilever Domex Brand Manager and Homecare Digital Lead Nicole Villavicencio raised a toast to conclude the event: \"We appreciate and recognize all of our homemakers for the unstoppable efforts to make their house a home. With Domex, trust that in the years to come, we are with you in keeping your homes safe and clean.\" With Domex, homemakers can reclaim their time and enjoy the satisfaction of a beautifully maintained home, knowing they have the right tools to keep it clean and safe for their loved ones. For those looking for a way to easily clean bathrooms, Domex is available in Lazada, Shopee, and at all major supermarkets nationwide.
