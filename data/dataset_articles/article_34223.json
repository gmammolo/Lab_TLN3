  "text": "A message from Robert McMaster, Vice Dean, Research and Teresa Tsang, Associate Dean, Research, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute.\nWe are pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Shernaz Bamji and reappointment of Dr. Lynn Raymond as Co-Directors of the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health (DMCBH) for a five-year term, effective to June 30, 2029.\nDr. Shernaz Bamji is a professor in the Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, and served as Associate Director of DMCBH since 2020. Her research is focused on understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying neural connectivity and synaptic plasticity. Her work has provided key insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying learning and memory, as well as how these processes are disrupted in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders such as intellectual disabilities, schizophrenia, autism and Alzheimer’s disease.\nDr. Bamji was a founding member of the School of Biomedical Engineering, and previously served as President of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience. She currently sits on the Board of Brain Canada.\nDr. Lynn Raymond is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry, and has served as Director of DMCBH since 2020. She is also the Clinic Director of the Centre for Huntington Disease. As a clinician-scientist, she brings a unique perspective to her work on neurodegenerative diseases, bridging the gap between research and patient care. Her lab investigates the mechanisms that lead to Huntington disease, focusing on changes in brain circuits and glutamate receptor function.\nDr. Raymond previously served in leadership roles including on the DMCBH Executive Committee during the centre’s formative years, as Director of the UBC MD/PhD Program and as President of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience.\nOver the past four years, Drs. Raymond and Bamji’s combined expertise and collaborative leadership have helped DMCBH achieve significant milestones. Under their guidance, the centre created its first strategic plan, aligned closely with the strategic priorities of the Faculty of Medicine and Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. They have also fostered increased interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers and clinicians through the formation of five integrated research programs, ultimately leading to more discoveries in the lab translating into real-world solutions for patients.\nTogether, Drs. Raymond and Bamji have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health’s vision of advancing brain health across the lifespan. With their continued leadership as Co-Directors, the Centre is poised to build on its world-class reputation as a hub for innovative research, education and patient care. Looking ahead, their vision for a future School of Neuroscience will further position UBC as a global leader in neuroscience.\nPlease join us in congratulating Drs. Raymond and Bamji on their appointment.",
