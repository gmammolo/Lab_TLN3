  "text": "Today's Safety News Government Safety Regulations Occupational Safety OSHA OSHA reports decline in worker death investigations Credit: OSHA\nNovember 7, 2024 Fewer workers are dying from hazards where OSHA has focused its enforcement resources, the agency reports. Preliminary agency data show a decrease in fatalities the agency is mandated to investigate, including significant reductions in fatal injuries from trench collapses and falls, two of the leading causes of death among construction industry workers.\n“These numbers are promising evidence that stronger enforcement and collaboration with labor and management, driven by the Biden-Harris administration’s worker-centered approach, is saving lives,” said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Douglas Parker. “ Most striking is the improvement in areas we have focused on with employers and unions. Our state program partners have also seen improvements.”\nIn fiscal year 2024, federal OSHA investigated 826 worker deaths, an 11 percent reduction from 928 in the previous year. Excluding Covid-related deaths, this is the lowest number of worker fatalities OSHA has been mandated to investigate since FY 2017.\nOSHA’s National Emphasis Program on Falls, the leading cause of serious work-related injuries and fatalities in the construction industry, saw fatal falls investigated by federal OSHA drop from 234 to 189, a decrease of almost 20 percent. Preliminary data from state OSHA programs, pending validation by federal OSHA, indicates more than 15 percent fewer fatalities in state jurisdictions. Currently, federal OSHA covers about 60 percent of private-sector employees and approved state programs cover the remaining workers.\nNational reporting by federal and state OSHA programs shows worker deaths in trench collapses declined nearly 70 percent since calendar year 2022. Fatalities decreased from 39 in 2022 to 15 in 2023 and, to date, 12 in calendar year 2024. These decreases follow intensive outreach and education by OSHA and industry partners, work by state plans and aggressive enforcement under a “zero tolerance” policy for unprotected trenches, including immediate inspections and referrals for criminal prosecution where warranted.\n“While fewer workers have died from the hazards OSHA investigates, we still lose more than 5,000 workers each year in largely preventable incidents. While we’re proud of this progress, our work is far from over. Reducing worker deaths means embracing an approach that makes worker health and safety a core value in every workplace. Only then can we fully address all the causes and factors that lead to workers dying needlessly on the job,” added Parker.\nKEYWORDS: data fall protection OSHA investigation trench safety worker safety workplace deaths Share This Story",
