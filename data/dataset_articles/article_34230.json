  "text": "Many house fires today, burn faster, hotter, and are deadlier than ever. That’s because many newer homes have open floor plans with fewer walls and doors, allowing the fire to travel faster and more freely. Another factor is that many homes have furnishings made with synthetic materials, like plastic or particleboard, which burn much quicker than say, solid wood, so getting an early fire warning and then getting out is more important than ever. The National Fire Protection Association advises that we should: - Install an alarm on each floor - Test the alarms once a month - Replace alarms after 10 years Consumer Reports' exclusive smoke detector ratings are free, so if you're not sure what to buy they may be a good place to start. The SimpliSafe SSSD3 dual-sensor smoke detector received top scores for detecting both flaming and smoldering fires. It’s battery-operated, which means you won’t need a professional to hard-wire it. It can also be interconnected so if one alarm sounds off, the others will follow. The battery-powered Kidde i9070 smoke detector also received top scores for detecting both flaming and smoldering fires. The Siterwell GS526A smoke detector from Walmart is another good option and comes with a ten-year battery.",
