  "text": "An exciting transformation is happening in Greater Peoria , as OSF HealthCare and Carle Health implement cutting-edge technologies and expand access to services.\nHealth care, which has become the largest employment sector in the U.S., is a cornerstone of Greater Peoria’s economy. In fact, health care jobs grew 33% from 1990 to 2019.\nOSF Transforms Care OSF HealthCare, the region’s largest employer, has fueled this growth through investments, including prioritizing accessibility for patients in rural areas by providing convenient health care options and minimizing travel burdens.\n“OSF HealthCare has advanced access to care throughout central Illinois through the development of telehealth and mobile care that is accessible to patients 24/7,” says Michelle Conger, chief strategy officer of OSF HealthCare and CEO of OSF digital health. “That means patients get the care they need when they need it and at a lower cost.”\nThe recently opened OSF HealthCare Cancer Institute is a $230 million project that will improve access to health care, solidify Peoria’s reputation as a medical hub and attract people from out of town.\nFor families touched by a cancer diagnosis, this state-of-the-art facility offers comprehensive treatment options in Peoria, eliminating the need for patients to travel to Chicago for specialized care.\n“Patients battling cancer don’t have to go at it alone or leave the area,” says James McGee, MD, radiation oncologist and founding director of the OSF HealthCare Cancer Institute. “The OSF Cancer Institute stands ready to be a partner in this fight” Other OSF initiatives improving health care in the region include Jump Simulation, which trains medical professionals in Peoria using high-tech simulations. This collaboration between OSF HealthCare and the University of Illinois College of Medicine Peoria is developing new health care solutions through cutting-edge technology.\nVirtual reality is also transforming medical education and surgical practices at OSF. Surgeons can now immerse themselves in virtual representations of tumors or heart issues, enabling them to meticulously plan the most efficient surgical approaches.\n“Patients get the care they need when they need it and at a lower cost.”\nMichelle Conger, OSF HealthCare\n“This technology holds immense potential, not just for surgical planning but also for education and training,” says Mike Wells, president of OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center.\nCarle Health Merges and Modernizes In April 2023, Carle Health expanded its reach by integrating the Peoria-based UnityPoint Health hospital network into its system, including Methodist, Proctor and Pekin hospitals, along with 76 associated clinics in the area. This move extended the comprehensive, vertically integrated health care system where all departments and clinics work seamlessly together.\n“This integration allowed us to leverage best practices of both entities to enhance patient experience and bring innovation and individualized care for years to come,” says Keith Knepp, MD, president of Carle Health Greater Peoria.\nCarle Health Greater Peoria Carle Health Greater Peoria is one of the area’s leading health care providers. The integration showcases Carle Health’s commitment to technological innovation as an early priority in bringing new equipment to impact patient care. New ultrasound machines with superior accuracy are aiding in earlier detection and faster diagnosis of breast cancer, minimizing wait times after abnormal mammograms. Additionally, cutting edge MRI technology is leading to faster, more comfortable scans for patients and expanded imaging services for local communities.\nCarle Health is also pioneering advancements in cardiac care. One such innovation is a specialized pacemaker that trains the heart to pump more efficiently over time. Additionally, Carle Health utilizes advanced catheters to remove blood clots and prevent potentially life-threatening complications.\nFor patients suffering from atrial fibrillation, Carle Health offers three new methods using ablation techniques. These minimally invasive procedures involve small burns or freezes applied to the heart to disrupt the irregular electrical signals causing arrhythmia.\nRecently, Carle Health opened Trillium Place Young Minds Center in West Peoria. This state-of-the-art behavioral health facility houses inpatient and outpatient mental health services for children and adolescents. The center’s inclusive environment, ample space and beautiful grounds create a therapeutic atmosphere that is vastly different from traditional hospital settings and caters to the customized needs of each patient.\n“We are thrilled to open a youth specific facility that not only allows us to expand care but specialize care and create an incredible healing environment for our children,” says Mary Thompson, president of Trillium Place.\nGet to Know Greater Peoria\nWant to learn more about living and working in Peoria?
