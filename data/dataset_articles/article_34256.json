  "text": "We establish a mouse model of progressive diabetes induced by conditional NAT1 deficiency in vascular endothelial cells. NAT1 deficiency promotes the activation of RIPK1 owing to a type of post-translational modification mediated by spermidine and deoxyhyupisin synthase termed acetyl-hypusination. Our results suggest that inhibition of RIPK1 could be used to treat type 2 diabetes and vascular inflammation.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n24,99 € / 30 days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n195,33 € per year\nonly 16,28 € per issue\nBuy this article\n- Purchase on SpringerLink\n- Instant access to full article PDF\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nReferences\nKnowles, J.
