  "text": "Young artisans revive curative benefits of Chinese incense New generation turns to scents, traditional rituals to relieve pressures of modern life [ ](//global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202411/08/WS672d4000a310f1265a1cc21e_2.html) Incense-maker Weng Jianzhi had a fascination with herbs from a young age, sparked by a colorful herb-identification publication he found at a local bookstore. Growing up, he spent hours exploring the hillsides near his home in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, learning to recognize various plants and herbs, a curiosity that would later shape his life and career. His father's quiet workshop, with its lingering scents and dedication to incense-making, was another influence, even if Weng didn't realize it at the time. \"It was like a seed planted in my mind,\" he recalled, \"watching my father making incense for religious rituals.\" Today, 32-year-old Weng is working to bring back the ancient craft of hexiang — the harmonious blending of different herbal aromas to create scents that have curative qualities. \"My father's incense was simple, mostly for temples. But as I read more, I realized that Chinese incense was once an art and a wellness practice — one based on hexiang and rooted in traditional Chinese medicine,\" he explained.",
