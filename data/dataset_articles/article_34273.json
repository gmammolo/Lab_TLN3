  "text": "Semarang, C Java (ANTARA) - The Central Java government has assured that catering businesses involved in the Free Nutritious Meals program trial have been verified and will follow standards set by the National Nutrition Agency (BGN). Yunita Dyah Suminar, Head of the Central Java Health Office, stated on Thursday that meal providers in the program's trial are primarily micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). She confirmed that these MSME-level catering businesses have been verified and will adhere to the BGN’s guidelines in preparing nutritious meals. In addition to collaborating with BGN, the Health Office will also coordinate with relevant regional apparatus organizations (OPDs) for the trial's implementation.

In Central Java, the program trial will be conducted in Brebes, Wonosobo, and Kebumen, as these regions have higher poverty rates. Suminar shared that during the trial, free meals will be provided to students during their first break of the school day for 25 consecutive days.

Each meal costs Rp15,000 (less than US$1), with a menu including animal and plant-based protein and carbohydrates,\" she said. The trial's evaluation will be conducted in stages and will address issues related to meal provision, distribution, and menu feasibility.",
