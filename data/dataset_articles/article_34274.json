  "text": "The market for pomegranate arils is in good shape, says GVK Naidu, managing director of Sam Agri: \"The market for pomegranate arils is robust, driven by growing consumer demand for healthy and convenient snack options. Our focus on quality and year-round supply has positioned us as a reliable supplier in this expanding market. Our most important markets include the United States, Continental Europe and New Zealand. These regions prioritize high-quality, safe, traceable fresh-cut produce, aligning well with our product offerings. We are also looking to expand our reach in Asian markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, where demand for pomegranate arils is growing.\" The increases of logistical costs were unexpected and did impact the business significantly, Naidu explains. \"The Red Sea crisis has impacted our bottom line, as air freight rates have increased by 2x to 3x to certain destinations. Even at these higher freight rates, it is sometimes difficult to secure airspace. However, we have a strategic advantage with our three high-care facilities connected to three different international airports in India, allowing us to deliver on time to our customers across the globe, despite these challenges.\" Naidu is positive about the season ahead, but hopes for the Red Sea crisis to be resolved: \"We expect prices to remain stable in the upcoming months, although this depends on the resolution to the Red Sea crisis. We have a good season ahead of us in terms of quality, and we anticipate strong demand for our pomegranate arils, driven by increasing consumer awareness of their health benefits. Our continuous supply and superior quality are expected to solidify our market position further.\" Next to selling pomegranate arils, Naidu is excited to have more products produced from the pomegranate fruits. \"Sam Agri Group has recently invested in further value addition of pomegranate, by setting up a boutique winery after more than five years of research. Now, Sam's pomegranate wine is creating a niche in the market and we expect to enter international markets soon. We have also launched cold-pressed pomegranate seed oil, which has many benefits for skin care and hair growth and we anticipate supplying this to renowned personal care and cosmetic brands.\" Sam Agri Group will be exhibiting during Asia Fruit Logistica in Hong Kong this year: \"Our goals for Asia Fruit Logistica this year include showcasing our flagship products, expanding our market reach in Asian markets, and forging new partnerships. We aim to highlight our commitment to quality and innovation at our stand in Hall 5-G51 and seek import partners in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand,\" Naidu concludes.
