  "text": "A new accessible supermarket checkout launched by Woolworths Hurstville is giving people with a physical disability greater independence. Designed to enhance the shopping experience for staff who use wheelchairs, or people with other limitations including lower body amputations, the checkout operator reduces physical strain by minimising the need to stand for an extended period of time. It was installed as part of a store renovation that was completed this week. The innovative design is wider than a regular checkout. With its adjustable height, the checkout eliminates heavy lifting by giving team members the opportunity to rotate backed bags. Australian Paralympian Col Pearse was at the Hurstville store to cut the ribbon, officially opening the checkout. \"It's awesome to see Woolworths making it easier for people with disabilities to work in a supermarket,\" he said. \"I know for someone like me who has a lower-leg amputation, standing for extended periods can be painful, so this checkout has the potential to open doors to lots of different people with disabilities. \"It's also pretty cool that Woolworths has involved people with disabilities to actually design the checkout because we can help point out small things that make a big difference and help remove some of those barriers to jobs like this.\" Managing Director of Woolworths 360, Rob McCartney, said the team represented a diverse community. \"The onus is on us to create more accessible jobs,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, there have traditionally been practical barriers for people who use wheelchairs or have other physical disabilities to work in many retail spaces, however we're working to change that with these new accessible checkouts, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to make them available in other stores.\" The renewal includes a revamped front entrance, new flooring, electronic shelf labels and an extended dairy selection. The store has also increased its international foods section, with the area dedicated to Asian foods almost doubling in size. Sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date.
