  "text": "UTPB student given free hearing aids ODESSA, Texas (KOSA) - Elijah Givens is taking classes at UT Permian Basin and is hard of hearing. It has been years since he‘s had hearing aids, but he’d learned to navigate the world without them. School was still hard for him. One of his professors noticed Givens struggling to keep up with assignments and reached out to other UTPB staff about what help they could provide to Givens. Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Student Emergency and Disability Services, Amber Lucero, got involved. She learned about Givens' condition and his education. “[Amber] told us that Elijah was having some trouble in class and was struggling to hear his teachers,” said Sandy Stowe, Hearing Instrument Specialist at Beltone. With her help, Givens received a pair of hearing aids, for free from Beltone. “After coordinating with Sandy with Beltone, they were able to actually gift the student with a brand new pair of top of the line hearing aids for him,” Lucero said. Givens said he is happy he can now hear his professors better. “It’s been a blessing,” Lucero said. Givens is working towards a Bachelors of Arts degree. “I was glad to call Beltone to see if they would be willing to donate some hearing aids to help this young man. We are fitting him with some new hearing aids,” Stowe said. Copyright 2024 KOSA. All rights reserved.",
