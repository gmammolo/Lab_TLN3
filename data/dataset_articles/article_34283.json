  "text": "The Cherokee County Health Services Council has announced a new partnership with Global US Marketing to combat the opioid overdose crisis in the community. Through this partnership, CCHSC has provided training to Global US Marketing employees on opioid overdose recognition and response. A Naloxone purple stand has been installed at 707 E. Downing St. This stand is stocked by CCHSC with the support of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. It provides constant access to Narcan, medication deactivation kits, and resource brochures. QR codes on the stand link to instructional videos on how to administer Narcan in multiple languages. “We are thrilled to collaborate with Global US Marketing to expand access to life-saving resources,” said Jennifer Phillips, an outreach coordinator at CCHSC. “By providing training and harm reduction supplies, we aim to reduce the number of opioid overdose deaths in our community.” Recent CDC data from May 2024 indicates a decrease in opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. from 84,181 in 2022 to 81,083 in 2023. CCHSC believes increased education and access to harm reduction supplies, such as Narcan, have contributed to this positive trend. Individuals or businesses interested in opioid overdose training can contact Phillips at 918-506-4058.",
