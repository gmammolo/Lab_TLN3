  "text": "The following is a press release from Missoula County Sheriff's Office:\nMISSOULA, Mont. - In a collaborative effort to promote child safety and prevent head injuries, the Missoula County Sheriff’s Office and the Brain Injury Alliance of Montana (BIAMT) joined forces to provide free, high-quality multi-sport helmets to all students at Seeley Lake Elementary School. The event, which took place Thursday afternoon, featured not only the distribution of helmets but also a hands-on fitting session and a helmet safety education display.\nThis initiative, funded through a generous donation from a compassionate Seeley Lake resident, will ensure that students from kindergarten through 8th grade receive properly fitted helmets at no cost to their families. With this donation, BIAMT and the Sheriff’s Office aim to reduce financial barriers for families and protect children in the Seeley Lake community as they engage in activities like biking, skating, and other sports.\n“We are thrilled to partner with BIAMT to provide this essential safety equipment to our students,” said Mike Sunderland, Missoula County Sheriff’s Office Deputy. “Ensuring that every child in our community has access to a helmet they can wear with confidence is a huge step toward preventing head injuries and promoting safe habits.”\nEvent Highlights Include:\n• Free Helmet Distribution: Every student, grades K–8, will receive a new, multi-sport helmet.\n• Personalized Helmet Fitting: BIAMT staff will ensure each helmet is secure and comfortable.\n• Helmet Safety Presentation: An interactive, kid-friendly presentation on the importance of helmet use and injury prevention.\nThis collaboration exemplifies BIAMT’s mission to empower Montana communities by providing access to critical safety resources and education.
