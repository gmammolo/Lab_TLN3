  "text": "Staff of the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital at Mampong Akuapem in the Eastern Region held a candlelight procession on Wednesday, September 7, 2024, for their late colleague, Ruth Mamley Nartey, who tragically died after being knocked down by a car. The candlelight procession, held in memory of the deceased, saw the entire staff of the hospital marching to the accident scene where prayers were held and a commemorative tree was planted in her honour. Colleagues and other staff of the hospital, including management members, took turns to pay glowing tributes to the late Ruth Mamley for her personality and dedication to work. Another commemorative tree was also planted at the Family Planning Unit where she worked. Before her demise, the deceased was on the verge of securing funding for the establishment of a Breast Cancer Unit, having led extensive research and submitted a proposal to the Akuapem North Municipal Assembly. The 27-year-old nurse was knocked down by a car on October 30, 2024, a few metres from the main entrance of the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital after closing from work. She subsequently died at the Ridge Hospital in Accra after being referred for further treatment. Her death led to a spontaneous protest by workers of Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital on Friday, October 31, 2024, demanding stringent road safety measures along the stretch to safeguard staff and clients of the hospital. The Eastern Regional Minister visited the hospital during the protest and assured immediate steps to manage the situation on the road. Demands by the aggrieved staff include the installation of speed ramps, adequate road signs and markings, as well as the construction of a footbridge on the stretch. The workers have threatened to put their services on hold if their demands are not met as soon as possible. Meanwhile, a funeral service for the late Ruth Mamley has been scheduled for Saturday, November 16, 2024, at Ayikuma, off the Dodowa Road, while a vigil will be held in her honour at the premises of the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital on the night of Friday, November 14, 2024.",
