  "text": "Saints Week 10 Injury Report: Key Players on the Mend!\nThe New Orleans Saints have a chance to improve their health as key players return from injury during Week 10. This comes after a challenging season, reflected in their 2-7 record, highlighted by key player absences. Significant updates include the return of starting center Erik McCoy, who has begun practicing after a groin injury that required surgery. Additionally, safety Will Harris is moving towards a return after recovering from a hamstring issue, although some players like Rashid Shaheed remain out for the season.\n- Saints currently hold a 2-7 record this season.\n- Erik McCoy is returning after 6 weeks on injured reserve.\nWhile key players are returning, the Saints will still likely miss several contributors this week, including Kool-Aid McKinstry, Cedrick Wilson Jr., and Lucas Patrick, which raises questions about their depth.\nState of Play- Erik McCoy has been practicing but may not be ready to play immediately.\n- Will Harris has transitioned from limited to full practice, increasing his chances of playing on Sunday.\nAs the Saints approach Sunday’s game, the focus will be on activating McCoy and Harris. Their return could significantly impact the team's performance in upcoming matchups.\nBottom LineKey returns could rejuvenate the Saints as they navigate the second half of the season, but their ability to overcome existing injuries and a struggling record will be crucial for improving their playoff hopes.\nRead more at whodatdish.com\nThe summary of the linked article was generated with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology from OpenAI",
