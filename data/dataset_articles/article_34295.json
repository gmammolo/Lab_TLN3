With a creamy spiced pumpkin filling atop a buttery gluten-free shortbread or graham cracker crust, these pumpkin pie bars offer the best of classic pie in an easy-to-make, easy-to-serve treat that’s perfect for any fall gathering.\nQUICK LINKS: Crust Options | Recipe FAQ\nI've recently learned that there are two types of pumpkin pie lovers: those who want whipped cream with their pumpkin pie and those who want pumpkin pie with their whipped cream. It's a subtle difference, but I suspect the people who prefer mountains of whipped cream hiding their pie haven't ever had anything as crowd-pleasing as these gluten-free pumpkin pie bars.\nThe custardy creamy filling is so rich and velvety that it doesn't need loads of whipped cream. A dollop will do to bring out the classic nostalgic flavor.\nThis recipe was inspired by my classic gluten-free dairy-free pumpkin pie tart , but in an easy-to-serve bar. You can make these bars dairy-full or dairy-free and they'll wow your friends either way!\nWhy you'll love this recipe Quick and easy to make : This recipe requires just one bowl—use the same bowl for the crust and the filling. The crust is pressed into a pan, parbaked, and the filling ingredients are whisked together, poured into the pan and baked. Creamy velvety texture : The filling is so silky smooth and creamy! Full of fall flavor : With plenty of spices, each bite tastes like fall. Uses an entire can of pumpkin : No waste, no need to save part of a can of pumpkin you may never use. Serves a crowd : This recipe makes 16 bars, so it's perfect for a crowd! Ingredients for Gluten-free Pumpkin Pie Bars For these gluten-free pumpkin pie bars, you can opt for a lightly sweetened buttery shortbread crust made with almond flour (my go-to!) or make it even easier by using a gluten-free graham cracker crust . The former has a more classic pumpkin pie flavor, while the latter offers convenience.\nThe custardy pumpkin filling uses simple ingredients and can easily be made dairy-free!\nHere's your shopping list:\nPumpkin Pie Filling :\nLight brown sugar Granulated sugar Cornstarch Spices: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, salt Large eggs Canned pumpkin purée: This recipe uses a whole 15oz can of pumpkin purée ( Not pumpkin pie filling). Heavy cream: Or, for a dairy-free version, use canned full-fat coconut milk. Vanilla extract Gluten-Free Shortbread Crust\nSuperfine blanched almond flour Sweet rice flour: Also called mochiko or glutinous rice flour, sweet rice flour is the same flour used to make mochi. It is distinctly different than white rice flour or brown rice flour. I recommend Koda Farms brand . Sweet rice flour is the sticky \"glue\" that holds the crust together so it doesn't crumble. Cornstarch : Cornstarch keeps the crust crisp and snappy. Granulated sugar Ground cinnamon Kosher salt Unsalted butter Vanilla extract OR 1 Gluen-free Graham Cracker Crust\nVisit the recipe card for exact quantities!\nHow to Make Easy Gluten-Free Pumpkin Pie Bars These gluten-free pumpkin bars can either be made in a single mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. You don't even need to wipe the bowl out between making the crust and the filling. They're a great no-fuss pumpkin pie treat!\nMaking the Crust Either make an almond-flour shortbread crust or a gluten-free graham cracker crust - your choice! Use a stand mixer or use a large mixing bowl with a silicone spatula.\nStart by lining an 8x8 or 9x9 square baking pan with parchment paper.\nFor the gluten-free shortbread crust, mix the dry ingredients.\nAdd the softened butter and vanilla.\nMix until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough clumps when pinched. You can use a stand mixer or do this with a silicone spatula.\nDump the crumbs into the prepared baking pan.\nPress the dough into the pan, using your hands or a flat measuring up to flatten it until it is even and compact\nChill while you preheat the oven. Dock the crust all over with the tines of a fork.\nPar-bake the crust for 18 minutes. When it comes out of the oven, use a measuring cup or the bottom of a glass to press the crust down compactly.\nAlternatively, prepare and bake a gluten-free graham cracker crust .\nMaking the Filling While to crust is baking, prepare the filling in the same bowl, either a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl with a whisk. No need to wash the bowl, just wipe it out a bit.\nCombine the sugars, corn starch, and spices.\nWhisk together.\nAdd pumpkin, heavy cream, eggs, and vanilla.\nPour the filling into the par-baked crust.\nBake until the center is no longer jiggly. 45-50 minutes for an 8x8 pan or 40-45 minutes for a 9x9 pan. Let cool and chill before slicing.\nTip : To ensure your bars are fully set, they need to cool completely before transferring to the fridge to chill for at least an hour.\nShortbread Crust versus Graham Cracker Crust I've developed this recipe to work with a homemade gluten-free shortbread crust as well as a gluten-free graham cracker crust . Both are delicious, and whether you choose one over the other is your preference of flavor, baking skill required, and time.\nThe almond flour shortbread crust is thicker with a crisp bottom. Lightly sweetened, the flavor is much more reminiscent of classic pumpkin pie. While it requires more ingredients and moderately more skill, the flavor and texture pay off is worth it! This crust also stays crisp under the moist pumpkin pie filling for multiple days.\nThe gluten-free graham cracker crust requires just a couple of ingredients, one of which is store-bought gluten-free graham crackers. It comes together super quickly and is essentially foolproof. The sweetness depends on the specific graham crackers you buy, so it can taste sweeter than the shortbread crust. The flavor of the graham cracker crust is more dominant and pronounces, but it still pairs well with the pumpkin custard filling. Due to its more porous texture, the graham cracker crust tends to stay crisp only for a day or two after it's been baked under the moist filling.\nHeavy Cream versus Evaporated Milk Filling While many pumpkin pie recipes call for evaporated milk, I recommend heavy cream as it creates a creamy and luxurious texture. The richness of heavy cream enhances the overall flavor, creating a richer mouthfeel. That being said, evaporated milk will work too!\nFor a dairy-free version, see below!\nTip for Crisp Crust The longer pumpkin pie bars are stored, the more likely the moisture from the custard filling will begin to soften the crust. I typically bake my pumpkin pie bars the day before I plan to serve them, chilling them overnight.\nPumpkin Pie Many Ways If you're looking for a more classic pumpkin pie, try my gluten-free pumpkin pie ! Or you can go crustless and try my crustless pumpkin pie with pecan topping . And if you need a vegan pumpkin pie , I've got you covered too!\nRecipe FAQ What kind of pan to use for pumpkin pie bars? For these bars, you can use any metal or glass 8x8 or 9x9 baking dish. If using a 8x8 baking dish, the bars will be thicker as pictured above with the shortbread crust. If using a 9x9 baking dish, the bars will be thinner as in the pictures above with the graham cracker crust, and will need to bake for 5 minutes less.\nCan you Make Dairy-Free Gluten-Free Pumpkin Pie Bars Yes! To make these pumpkin pie bars dairy-free, simply substitute the heavy cream in the filling for canned full-fat coconut milk. For the crust, use the dairy-free option of graham cracker crust or use refined coconut oil or stick plant butter in place of the butter in the shortbread crust.\nHow to store gluten-free pumpkin dessert bars Store any leftovers covered with plastic wrap or in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.\nMore Gluten-Free Fall Desserts Here are a few of my favorite gluten-free fall desserts to make this month!\nVanilla Bean Pear Persimmon Pie Pumpkin Gluten-Free Vegan Bread Pudding Gluten-Free Pumpkin Muffins Chewy Gluten-Free Pumpkin Cookies Recipe Gluten-Free Pumpkin Pie Bars yields: 16 bars prep time: 10 minutes mins cook time: 1 hour hr 5 minutes mins total time: 1 hour hr 15 minutes mins Enjoy the flavors of homemade gluten-free pumpkin pie without the hassle of rolling out a crust!

Prepare the crust - either gluten-free graham cracker crust or gluten-free shortbread crust. For the gluten-free shortbread crust, mix together the almond flour, sweet rice flour, corn starch, cinnamon, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl with a silicone spatula. Add the softened butter and vanilla and mix on medium-low until the butter is fully incorporated and the dough clumps when pinched. Dump the crumbs into the prepared baking pan and press them out evenly into the pan, using your hands or a flat measuring up to flatten it until it is even and compact. Chill for 10 minutes while you preheat the oven to 350°F. Dock the crust all over with the tines of a fork. Par bake the crust for 18 minutes. When it comes out of the oven, use a measuring cup or the bottom of a glass to press the crust down compactly. While to crust is baking, prepare the filling in the same bowl, either a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl with a whisk. No need to wash the bowl, just wipe it out a bit. Whisk together the sugars, corn starch, and spices. Add the pumpkin, heavy cream, eggs, and vanilla and whisk until completely smooth. Pour the filling into the par-baked crust and bake until the center is no longer jiggly. 45-50 minutes for a 8x8 pan and 40-45 minutes for a 9x9 pan. Once baked, let cool at room temperature before transferring to the fridge to chill for at least an hour. Notes Canned Pumpkin: I recommend non-organic canned pumpkin as organic canned pumpkin tends to have a lot higher moisture content which can negatively affect the outcome of a recipe.
