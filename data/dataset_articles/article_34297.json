  "text": "Georgia finalizes settlement with Kroger, secures $55M for opioid treatment and recovery efforts ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Attorney General Chris Carr announced that the State of Georgia will receive more than $55 million to expand access to opioid treatment, prevention and recovery services. This is part of a recently finalized agreement with Kroger, which totals $1.37 billion overall and includes a bipartisan coalition of 30 states. “We’re fighting this battle on multiple fronts by declaring war on fentanyl and holding accountable those who have contributed to this crisis in the first place,” Carr said. The nationwide opioid epidemic started in the 1990s with increased opioid prescribing and opioid overdose deaths, the department says, [according to the Georgia Department of Public Health](https://dph.georgia.gov/stopopioidaddiction/opioid-and-substance-misuse-response-program). The total number of deaths in Georgia increased by 302% from 2010 to 2022, the department says. The increases appeared to be driven by fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid often found in drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and counterfeit pills. ORIGINAL STORY: [Kroger agrees to pay up to $1.4 billion to settle opioid lawsuits](https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/09/08/kroger-agrees-pay-up-14-billion-settle-opioid-lawsuits/) The deal, announced in September 2023, declared that Kroger Co. would pay up to $1.4 billion over 11 years. This includes up to $1.2 billion for state and local governments where it operates, $36 million to Native American tribes and about $177 million to cover lawyers’ fees and costs. Copyright 2024 WANF.
