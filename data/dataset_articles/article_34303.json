  "text": "A young rancher understands more about the environmental relationship between ruminants & methane, soil, water & carbon than the WHO & most every government in Europe & N. America combined. He explains in 3 mins what they can’t learn in a lifetime. pic.twitter.com/mhnk51THGa\nh/t…\n— 💯 Cary Kelly 💯 (@CaryKelly11) February 5, 2024\nGrazing is regenerative agriculture, the bests single way to sequester carbon from the atmosphere into the soil, by grazing off plants and bringing the cattle in, we’re managing a solar panel, it needs to be green and growing so it can capture sunlight and pull carbon from the air and put it into its roots, but those plants will stop doing that if they get too tall, or they get too short.\nSo what farmers do with their cattle is they come in and graze those plants off, so they rest it, they prune the solar panel so it doesn’t get too tall and then they leave and it rests, and that graze rest recovery is actually a cycle of pulling carbon from the air into the plant roots, and when those plants get grazed they actually release that carbon into the soil and in turn pick up water and other minerals from the soil microbiological activity cause our soils to be living and alive instead of dead and sterilized, and year after year putting it into our soil which produces more grass, which the allows us to graze and produce more cattle\nSeventy percent of the earths’ land is land that is not suitable for tillage, which is to say, it’s not arable, and if you just say we’re not going to do any cattle grazing you’ve completely given up the ability to produce food on that acreage and you’ve lost your single best tool to actually restore that land.\nThere are groups out there that have done these same principles in the desert and transformed desert landscapes into something that looks just beautiful and lush. Cattle can be a tool to heal that and in terms of water and addressing that they do drink a lot of water, however as the graze that water then filters down through healthy soil and it actually is a system that helps increase soil life and activity by drinking that water are actually continually watering the fields and they’re not as reliant on rainwater and so that cycle actually builds health and builds ecology deep into the soil and there’s no net loss of water in that system because it is a closed system.\nEven methane, well they you know they burp and they release methane and its greenhouse gas here in the last few years they have actually discovered that if you take a field that’s been grazed and regenerated with cattle for a few years that soil has microbes in it that break down methane, they didn’t think there was a microbe that could handle methane as it turn out they do and when they measured the total amount of them it turns out that the microbes in the soil that support, say 100 cows are actually capable of breaking down the methane from way more than 100 cows.\nIt’s all about how you take care of it, they can be a tool of destruction or they can be a tool of life, it really first comes down to how you care for them, and with cows. – Carey Kelly , US\nSource: https://cairnsnews.org",
