Japanese curry is a popular comfort food known for its thick, mildly spiced, and slightly sweet flavor profile. Unlike other curries, Japanese curry uses a rich roux base that creates a stew-like consistency, often filled with tender pieces of meat, potatoes, carrots, and onions. This flavorful dish is typically served over steamed rice or with noodles like udon. Japanese curry is easy to customize with various spice levels and ingredients, making it a versatile dish loved by all ages. Its unique taste and simplicity have made it a staple in Japanese cuisine and a favorite around the world.\nOrigins of Japanese Curry Japanese curry, or Kare Raisu (カレーライス, Curry Rice) , arrived in Japan during the late 19th century via the British navy, who brought Indian-inspired curry during the Meiji era. Initially a foreign luxury, it quickly adapted to Japanese tastes, becoming milder, sweeter, and thicker than traditional Indian curries. The introduction of ready-made curry roux in the 20th century made it even more accessible, allowing households to prepare it quickly and easily. Over time, Japanese curry evolved into a beloved comfort food with regional varieties and endless ingredient combinations, commonly served over rice or with noodles like udon.\nDifferences Between Japanese Curry and Other Curries from Around the World Japanese curry differs from other curries around the world due to its milder, sweeter flavor profile and thicker consistency. Unlike many South Asian or Southeast Asian curries that rely heavily on a variety of spices and herbs, Japanese curry typically uses a pre-made roux (a mixture of fat, flour, and curry powder), making it easier to prepare and offering a rich, velvety texture. Additionally, Japanese curry is often served with steamed short-grain rice, which is softer and more neutral in flavor compared to the rice in other curry dishes.\nSmooth vs. Chunky Japanese Curry Chunky Japanese curry, with its hearty chunks of vegetables and meat, is more of a homestyle dish. On the other hand, smooth curry is commonly found in restaurants, where the curry is often blended to a velvety consistency. This smoother texture pairs perfectly with katsu, as it coats the crispy breaded cutlet without overpowering it.\nKey Ingredients for Japanese Curry There are many variations of Japanese curry, which can vary depending on the ingredients used, as well as the region, household, and restaurant. Here are the 4 basic components to Japanese curry:\nJapanese Curry Roux There are so many brands of curry roux on the market and vary greatly in flavour. Many also come in mild, medium or spicy. Try a few and see which brand you like the most as everyone has different preferences but here’s a general idea of some popular ones and what they taste like:\nS&B Golden Curry: Made with 35 kinds of spices and herbs, giving it a stronger curry flavor with a balance of acidity and sweetness. It has a medium spice level and a looser texture. House Kokumaru: Features caramelized onions and a creamy roux. The sweetness from the onions and added cheese and creams create a mellow, rich flavor. It has a slightly sweet, creamy taste with a smooth texture. House Vermont Curry: Contains apples and honey, making it the sweetest of the brands. It has a thick, almost milky texture, with a fruity flavor that’s popular among children. S&B Dinner Curry: Known for its umami and elegant richness. It’s light, with a medium spice level and a medium-thick texture. House Java Curry: The spiciest brand, with a deep, rich flavor profile. It has no noticeable acidity or sweetness and a medium-thick texture, making it a favorite among adults. Glico Zeppin: Uses 40 spices, resulting in a deeply rich flavor with a balanced mix of sweetness, acidity, and spice. It’s creamy with a thick consistency. S&B Torokeru: Well-balanced in spices with a slight sweetness. It has a looser texture than some other brands but still coats the back of a spoon. Torokeru line does not contain meat or dairy so a great option for vegans! I personally grew up eating Torokeru and Golden curry so it’s very comforting to me. However, I recently tried Zeppin curry and that might be my favourite! I also often combine two curries like Vermont (sweet curry) and Java (spicy) to get the best of both worlds.\nProtein Beef, pork, and chicken are all popular choices for curry. Beef brings a rich, umami flavor that enhances the overall taste of the dish. Pork is tender and juicy, complementing curry well, while chicken offers a lighter, fresher taste that balances the dish’s richness. Each meat works well in curry, so choose based on your mood and preferences. For today’s recipe, we’ll be using chicken.\nWhen using chicken, thighs and wings with the skin are the best options. These cuts offer more flavor, and the fat from the skin adds richness and aroma to the curry. However, skin on boneless chicken thighs are not as readily available here in North America so my mom always used skinless chicken thighs which is also preferred over chicken breast due to its flavour and tenderness.\nVegetables Onions, potatoes, and carrots are standard ingredients in curry. Onions provide sweetness and richness, forming the base of the dish. Potatoes add a ‘fluffy’ texture and natural sweetness, making them a popular choice. Carrots bring vibrant color and nutrition. You can also enhance your curry with other vegetables like mushrooms, eggplant, bell peppers, and broccoli for added flavor and variety.\nKakushi Aji (Hidden Flavours and Secret Ingredients) In Japanese chicken curry, adding a “ kakushi aji ” (隠し味), or “hidden flavor,” is a popular technique that elevates the dish with subtle layers of taste. These hidden ingredients, like soy sauce, coffee, honey, or chocolate, are added in small amounts to create a richer and more complex curry. For Japanese chicken curry, a spoonful of miso or splash of soy sauce enhances umami, while grated apple adds natural sweetness, balancing the curry’s savory and spicy notes. By incorporating kakushi aji, you can transform your Japanese chicken curry into a deeper, more nuanced meal that’s irresistibly flavorful and unique. I have a whole blogpost that covered kaksushi aji used in Japanese cooking for some ideas but here are some great options specifically for curry:\napples honey ketchup banana tomato yogurt garlic ginger red chili pepper black pepper chocolate cocoa powder instant coffee oyster sauce mirin sake rice vinegar red or white wine tonkatsu sauce (Worcester sauce) miso soy sauce (add after roux) dashi (stock instead of broth or water) How to Make Japanese Chicken Curry Japanese curry is one of the easiest meals to make! Here’s a quick rundown:\nPrepare Onions : Thinly slice one onion and cut the other into eighths. Microwave sliced onion for 2 minutes, stirring halfway. Set aside. Caramelize Onions : In a pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add microwaved onions, cooking until golden, about 10-15 minutes. Cook Chicken : Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a separate pan, cook chicken in oil over medium-high heat for 4-5 minutes until no longer pink. Set aside. Build Curry Base : Add garlic and ginger to caramelized onions, sauté 2-3 minutes. Stir in cut onions, carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms. Add Chicken & Broth : Return chicken to pot. Pour in dashi or stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat. Cover and simmer 15-20 minutes until vegetables are tender. Flavor Curry : Grate an apple into the pot. Season with pepper and any additional flavors. Adjust to taste. Add Curry Roux : Once vegetables are soft, add broken-up curry roux. Stir until dissolved, then simmer 5-10 minutes to thicken. Serve : Serve hot over rice. Garnish with fukushinzuke and ryakyo. Enjoy! Top Tips for Delicious Japanese Curry Cut vegetables the same size: Varying ingredient sizes can cause uneven cooking—some pieces may remain firm and need extra time, while others might fall apart. To ensure even cooking, cut all ingredients to a uniform size. Quick, caramelized onions: Onions are a must in Japanese curry, but the extra step of caramelizing onions really add a lot of natural sweetness and flavour to curry. For quick caramelized onions, microwave them covered to speed up the wilting process and then finish it off in the pot until jammy. Skim the scum : This helps remove any unwanted odor and for a clean, pure and natural flavour from the chickena nd vegetables. Turn off the heat before adding roux: If the roux is heated too quickly, the starch may clump instead of dissolving smoothly into the broth. To prevent this, first turn off the heat, break up the roux, and add it to the pot, stirring until fully dissolved. Then, simmer on low heat for 5 to 10 minutes to allow the starch to cook fully, resulting in a thick, smooth curry. Simmer, don’t boil: Once the roux is added in, it is prone to burning. Always use low heat to simmer and stir every 5-10 minutes. Make extra: Curry tastes even better the next day! Make extra to have leftovers for the next day or freeze for future use. Japanese curry is great for meal prep! How to Serve Japanese Curry Japanese curry is traditionally served over a bed of Japanese short-grain rice, which complements its thick, mildly sweet, and savory sauce. For a classic presentation, pour the curry over half of the rice on a plate, leaving the other half visible. Garnish with pickled radish ( fukujinzuke ) or pickled onions ( ryakyo ). It’s also delicious with tonkatsu or chicken katsu creating a popular dish known as katsu curry .\nHow to Store and Reheat Leftover Curry To store leftover Japanese curry, allow it to cool to room temperature, then transfer it to an airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. When reheating, gently warm it on the stovetop over low heat, stirring occasionally, to prevent the sauce from sticking or separating. If the curry thickens after refrigeration, add a splash of water or broth to reach your desired consistency. For best results, store the rice separately to maintain its texture.\nYou can also use leftover curry to make kare pan (Japanese curry bread) , tamago cheese kare pan , baked kare pan, yaki curry , curry udon , curry ramen and more!\nRecipe FAQ\nMore Japanese Curry Recipes to Try Curry Udon Vegan Japanese Curry Coco Ichi Style Japanese Curry Vegan Tofu Katsu Curry Single Serving Japanese Curry Natto Curry Japanese Beef Curry (coming soon) Japanese Pork Curry (coming soon) Japanese Fish Katsu Curry (coming soon) Enjoy!!
