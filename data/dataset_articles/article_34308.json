  "text": "USD earns grant targeting substance abuse disorder treatment\nThe University of South Dakota announced a $2 million grant to support the school’s addiction and substance abuse disorder services Thursday.\nThe money comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and will be distributed over the course of two years.\nOfficials say it will open opportunities to individuals struggling East River.\nBrennan Thompson is overseeing the project and serves as director of addiction counseling and prevention services.\n“It will be focused on Minnehaha County DUI courts and drug courts,\" Thompson said. \"Its really just making sure the services that are required and offered are the most effective, then also adding on resources.”\nThat money will go to multiple new positions designed to help people navigate the legal and recovery systems.\n“We’ll be hiring a position called the justice navigator, and from there, the job with me will be to help participants when they enter into court then also navigating the whole way through,\" Thompson said. \"That includes transportation services, access to anything they need in relation to court, but also outside of that too.”\nThompson stressed the role will not only pertain to those in the legal system though.\n“They have to go to mental health counseling, they have to go to substance abuse counseling, they have to have a job,” Thompson said.\nWhile widely used as a suicide lifeline, the 988 Crisis Hotline is also free to use for individuals facing substance use disorders.",
