  "text": "NILES, Mich. (WSBT) — Four moms with similar stories, now looking to help other women just like them. These four mothers are from different parts of the country, all had near death experiences during or following childbirth. Brittney Gregory, Katherine Rush, Kelsey Johns, and Greta Reimold each came close to death with conditions that required a hysterectomy to survive. While surgeries saved their lives, that was only the beginning of their stories. Now, they are sounding the alarm about, what they call, a need for education following an emergency hysterectomy. WSBT22 News told you about the shocking state of maternal mortality in the United States . In 2022, there were 22 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in the United States, according to the CDC from data based on the National Vital Statistics System. We showed you how the United States compares to other high-income countries... the United States has the highest rate of maternal deaths of any high income nation according to a report by the Commonwealth fund, a private foundation that is focused on healthcare issues. It was after that story aired that we received a message from Kelsey Johns, a mom from Niles. She told us about her near-death experience due to a placenta accreta. A Placenta accreta, also known as placenta accreta spectrum, is a pregnancy complication that occurs when the placenta attaches too deeply into the wall of the uterus, according to National Accreta Foundation. Johns had a hysterectomy to survive but following the surgery she faced complications and major changes to her body. \"It can create such havoc on a woman's body and make you think you're losing your mind,\" said Johns. “Obviously if you have to have a hysterectomy to save your life, you're going to have that, but I was also told that life will go on and you'll be normal.\" Kelsey says her life was anything but normal.The physical and mental challenges she faced made her believe she only had months to live... unable to get answers from doctors, she turned to social media. She found a Facebook group, Hysterectomy to Survive Birth. The group, which she says, has thousands of members, provided hope and answers. It is where Brittney, Katherine, Kelsey, and Greta saw the similarities in their stories \"She basically said hey, you should have your hormones checked and I remember reading her comment and thinking, oh my word, that was the first time someone recommended doing that,\" said Katherine Rush who also joined the group searching for answers following her planned hysterectomy for apercreta. Rush says her surgery did not go smoothly and she struggled to talk and feel emotions months after her surgery. Tests revealed hormone deficiencies. \"These providers will tell you, no if you have your ovaries you probably don't have any problems, here is an antidepressant and go do some therapy. What they don't realize is, is that it is not helping,\" said Reimold. The women say for them, hormone therapy was the answer. The treatments replace hormones that tests revealed their bodies weren't producing post-surgery. \"You see daily posts on there where women are on the verge of taking their own life because they're suffering so badly,\" saidReimold. The women say that while not the answer for everyone, hormone therapy gave them their lives back. Johns tells us while doctors saved her life, it was the aftercare and education following surgery that was lacking and her problems post-surgery were dismissed by many doctors. The group of women, now advocate for women just like them, that feel like they are suffering in silence. \"If there is something wrong with your body and you know that...just keep searching for answers,\" said Johns.",
