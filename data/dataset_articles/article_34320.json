  "text": "BALTIMORE (WBFF) — Mayor Scott joined fellow elected officials, community leaders, and partners to kick off construction for two affordable housing projects for older adults in Baltimore City on Thursday. “Today’s groundbreaking for Irvington Mews II marks more than just the start of construction. It’s a promise to our older adults that we remain dedicated to ensuring they have a safe, affordable place to call home — a place designed with their needs in mind that keeps them in the same communities that they have fought to improve for decades. This project, and the far-reaching partnerships that made it possible, is a celebration of equitable economic development right here in Baltimore City and I could not be more proud to be part of it,” said Mayor Brandon Scott in a news release.

These two projects expand Enterprise’s affordable housing footprint in Baltimore which includes 18 communities serving 2,100 residents. “We are excited to break ground on two projects that reflect our deep commitment to creating affordable, sustainable homes for an important group of Baltimore residents, seniors and veterans,” said Janine Lind, President of Enterprise Community Development in a news release. “Aligned with our mission to make home and community places of pride, power and belonging, as well as platforms for resilience and upward mobility, we celebrate construction kickoff for these beautiful and modern new apartment homes that not only provide much-needed housing, but also help allow the residents to live independently and age in place.” Greens at Irvington Mews II, located at 200 S. Woodington Rd., is the second phase of the Greens at Irvington Mews development. The new four-story building will provide 59 apartments for low-to-moderate income independent seniors. This project includes 47 apartments for residents earning up to 50% of the AMI and 12 apartments for those earning up to 30% AMI, which will be prioritized for formerly homeless individuals, with a preference for veterans.

In line with Enterprise’s focus on sustainability, the building will use low VOC finishes, green-certified carpets, and other environmentally friendly materials. The $26.6 million project, funded by a combination of public and private sources, including the HUD Section 202 Program for the Elderly and Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), is expected to be completed by October 2025.",
