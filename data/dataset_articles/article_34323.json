The grant dollars were matched by Kettering Health Foundation’s board of directors for an overall total of $50,000. The funding will offset the cost of athletic training services for 17 local schools and provide upgraded athletic training room equipment.\n“High quality athletic training services are essential to keeping our student athletes safe and at their best while playing the sports they love,” said Rick Thie, president of Kettering Health Foundation. “Thanks to the NFL Foundation, we are able to support continued access to these important services as we work to promote the wellbeing of high school athletes in our community.”\nHelping student athletes\nThis marks the second year that Kettering Health Foundation has received the grant for football and other high school sports programs, benefiting approximately 5,000 student athletes at public schools in Greater Dayton. To ensure an effective and immediate impact, Kettering Health athletic trainers requested the new equipment based on the specific needs of the student athletes they serve.\nAthletic trainers provide a variety of services to student athletes, including injury prevention and assessment, emergency care during practice and games, and injury rehabilitation. The NFL Foundation’s Club Matching Athletic Trainer Grant provides matching funds for NFL Clubs to expand access to athletic trainers within their communities. The grant is part of the NFL Foundation’s ongoing initiative to identify and support high school football needs and growth opportunities.\nThe grant will offset the cost of athletic training for the below schools:\n- Bethel High School\n- Cedarville High School\n- Eaton High School\n- Fairborn High School\n- Hamilton High School\n- Kettering Fairmont High School\n- Miamisburg High School\n- National Trail High School\n- Northridge High School\n- Oakwood High School\n- Preble Shawnee High School\n- Stebbins High School\n- Trotwood High School\n- Twin Valley South High School\n- Valley View High School\n- West Carrollton High School\n- Xenia High School\nLearn more about our athletic trainers\n[Learn more](http://-https://ketteringhealth.org/services/sports-medicine/athletic-trainers/)\nThe month's most popular health news, stories, and tips in your inbox.\n[Sign Up](https://www.ireply.org/ketteringhealth/signup/)",
