  "text": "The 9 Best Organic Priobitcs For Better Gut Health\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nWe’ve researched and tested dozens of natural probiotics — these are our top nine picks made with clean and organic ingredients for maximum benefit.\nProbiotics are living organisms that are good for you (yes, they exist!) — think healthy bacteria, yeast, and spores. Once ingested, probiotic strains help restore your gut health, heighten immunity, reduce inflammation and allergies, and even support your mood.\nWhy should you look for natural and organic probiotics?\nNatural and organic probiotics offer numerous benefits that conventional probiotics miss out on. They are free from harmful chemicals like pesticides, GMOs, and synthetics. Organic farming practices also contribute to a healthier soil ecosystem and higher quality ingredients that can be used in probiotic formulas to boost their benefits (think prebiotic fiber from organic fruits). Organic probiotics are also more sustainable, as less synthetics and better biodiversity in farming practices minimize adverse impacts on our environment.\nAs with any ingestible supplement, knowing what to look for in a healthy, effective probiotic is important. According to both the Cleveland Clinic and WebMD, you want to search for quality brand names. You’ll also want to look for a probiotic with one billion or more colony-forming units (CFUs) or active fluorescent units (AFUs), and check that it aligns with your preferred dosage and form (consider capsules, gummies, or powder).\nWe’ve found nine of the best and most trusted natural probiotics out there, ranging from USDA certified organic formulas for immunity, to vegan options for gut health and digestion, to natural capsules for pregnancy or vaginal health. We also recommend chatting with your doctor for personalized suggestions or before starting any new supplement. If you have a probiotic you already love, we’d love to hear in the comments below!\nOur criteria:\n- NATURAL, HIGH-QUALITY INGREDIENTS | Each of these probiotics is made from natural ingredients that are third-party tested and highly effective.\n- AFFORDABILITY | We’ve offered a variety of choices for probiotics at various price points, prioritizing budget-friendly options.\n- ACTIVE FLUORESCENT UNITS (AFU) | Each of these brands provides detailed information on their CFU/AFU count, ensuring plenty of gut-friendly microorganisms are reaching your colon, where they’ll go to work!\nFor more supplement and vitamin options, check out our guides to the best multivitamins and probiotics for women. For parents-to-be, we also recommend looking at our prenatal vitamins roundup!\n**This review is not health advice. Please talk to your OBGYN or healthcare provider before adding any supplements to your diet.\nBest Overall | Best Powdered Probiotic | Most Affordable\n1.

The diverse bacterial strains support your GI tract and vaginal flora, and also build your baby’s microbiome throughout pregnancy.\nPerelel Review | “I absolutely love and highly recommend this probiotic!

AG1 (Athletic Greens)\nBest For | Comprehensive nutrition on the go\nNatural & Organic Ingredients | Vegan; organic ingredients; non-GMO; free of fillers & preservatives; free from gluten, corn, eggs, peanuts, dairy, and animal by-products\nPrice | $99/month; discounted subscriptions available (20%+ off)\nAG1 (formerly Athletic Greens) is a drinkable, portable powder supplement that covers all your daily nutrition needs through a mix of greens, vitamins, nutrients, and pre- and probiotics.

AG1 is a great choice for those who prefer supplementing via powder or have difficulty swallowing pills. Take their shelf-stable travel packs on the go with you, so you never miss a day!\nOur Editor’s Review | “Does AG1 taste good, and does it make you feel better? The short answer is yes to both. I’m always skeptical when trying new health products […] but AG1 tastes wonderful. I prefer drinking it as prescribed, mixed in with 8 ounces of cold water. But I’ve also mixed it into smoothies.” – Kayti Christian, Contributing Editor [Read our full review.]\n4.
