  "text": "9 Effective Supplements For Postpartum Hair Loss\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nOur editors have tested and researched dozens of vitamins, supplements, and serums to help with postpartum hair loss — these are our favorite picks with clean and safe ingredients.\nLet’s be transparent: Hair loss — especially a few months after pregnancy — is common. As bodies adjust to new hormone levels and growth cycles, it’s normal to notice hairs falling out more often. But it’s not as easy as just acknowledging this; hair loss can impact our self-confidence and body image — and our mental health, too.\nIf you’re dealing with postpartum hair loss, first know that you’re not alone. Secondly, there are natural supplements that can help. We’ve rounded up our favorites below, many of which use all-natural ingredients, are manufactured here in the US under strict safety and health guidelines, and are safe for breastfeeding parents.\nWhy does postpartum hair loss happen?\nPostpartum hair loss is incredibly common due to the hormonal changes that occur during and after pregnancy. Plummeting estrogen levels can make our hair shed and lead to noticeable loss — and the added fatigue and stress only exacerbate this situation. Add in nutritional deficiencies from breastfeeding, and, well, our hair seems to fall out at an alarming rate, which can be worrisome as we reach for any sort of normalcy in the postpartum stage. Fortunately, this hair loss is generally temporary, and as our hormones stabilize, new baby hairs and growth come in (if you know, you know!). The below supplements can help aid in this growth, which is why we love them.\nWhat vitamins help with hair growth?\nLook for ingredients like biotin, folate/folic acid, and vitamins B6 and B12 — they are considered the most important in hair growth and are almost all included in the formulas below. If you don’t see a recommended ingredient listed on a product label, we recommend reaching out to the brand just to make sure!\nOur criteria:\n- NATURAL/ORGANIC | We look for vitamins and supplements with natural and organic ingredients and prioritize brands with third-party certifications.\n- EFFICACY | We’ve tested many of the brands below ourselves for postpartum hair loss and to help with overall growth. All our recommendations are backed by reviews to ensure you’re getting a product that works.\n- AFFORDABLE | Cost is a number-one factor for a lot of folks, so we’ve included a range of price points here.\nFor more postpartum essentials, here are our must-haves for the fourth trimester.\n1. Ritual\nBest For | Postnatal support capsules\nNatural Ingredients | Vitamin A, B12, C, D, E, folate, zinc, biotin, magnesium, iron, vegan DHA\nPrice | $39 for 60 capsules (two daily); subscriptions available\nOur bodies are already going through a number of changes postpartum, not just hair loss. Ritual’s Postnatal Multivitamin accounts for that, with extra nutrients our bodies need throughout lactation and the first 6 months postpartum. From microalgae and vitamin B12 for brain health to zinc for immunity to biotin and folate for luscious locks, you can look to this all-in-one for whole-body support. The capsules are fully traceable, non-GMO, and vegan — and Ritual itself is a certified B Corp that equally prioritizes people, planet, and profit.\nCustomer Review | “[A] great product! [I] love it” – Rand A. (Read all reviews.)\n2. Prose\nBest For | Custom hair supplements\nNatural Ingredients | Vitamin B complex, zinc, turmeric extract, spirulina, grape seed extract, hibiscus extract (varies by formula)\nPrice | $62 for 30-day supply (two daily); discounted subscriptions available\nProse is best known for its custom shampoos and conditions that can be tailored to your needs, and the team has expanded into custom hair supplements now, too, for the most effective results. The “Custom Root Source™” regimen contains two capsules — the first is personalized just for you, and the second is made with Prose’s trademarked complex (PureCatalyst), formulated to reduce shedding and promote growth. Using plant-based ingredients like sesame seed, saffron, and turmeric, each blend takes its cues from nature so it’s about as clean as can be. Prose is a certified B Corp, so these supplements are cruelty-free, vegan, globally sourced, and blended in the US. Enjoy stronger, shinier hair and thoughtful business practices.\n3. Vegamour\nBest For | Vegan biotin gummies\nNatural Ingredients | Tapioca syrup, cane sugar, vitamins A, B5, B6, B12, C, E, biotin\nPrice | $36 for 30 vitamins (one daily); discounted subscriptions available\nIf taking multiple pills a day is too much, we recommend Vegamour’s GRO Biotin Gummies instead. This all-vegan formula leverages powerhouse ingredients like biotin, folic acid, and vitamin C to grow healthier hair — and support the scalp. You only need one gummy a day, and you can expect visible results as soon as the third month (check out some of the reviews that show progress in just one!). Cruelty-free, clinically tested, and color-safe, we love how intentional this formula is — and that a little goes a long way. Sign up for a monthly subscription to save an additional 16% plus free shipping.\nCustomer Review | “I had to get a bob due to bleach damage and my hair typically grew very very slow and I had first started off with the serum but it was hard to keep up with so I switched over to the gummies( they’re delicious !) and I cannot believe how much my hair has grown and no matter how many times I’ve dyed my hair my hair still shines. I originally took pictures for me to see if there was any difference and I’m so glad I did to share my experience !(:” – Kimberly R. (https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-7880526-13786891?sid=wel-web-pg-&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvegamour.com%2Fproducts%2Fgro-biotin-gummies.)\n4. Nutrafol\nBest For | Physician-formulated capsules\nNatural Ingredients | Organic rice hulls, hydrolyzed marine collagen, ashwagandha, hyaluronic acid, fruit extracts, vitamin A, C, D, E, biotin, zinc, selenium, iodine\nPrice | $88 for 120 capsules (four daily); discounted subscriptions available\nBetween its many five-star ratings, the 2021 NewBeauty award, and recommendations from dermatologists, Nutrafol is considered a miracle worker for postpartum hair loss. The formula is crafted by physicians and packed with natural ingredients to promote thicker, fuller hair within 3-6 months. While the ingredients do contain fish (in the marine collagen), it’s free of dairy, soy, gluten, and GMOs — and there’s a Women’s Vegan option too that uses plant-based ingredients. By targeting the root causes of hair loss, Nutrafol’s supplements will bring life back to your hair — the science proves it!\nCustomer Review | “Nutrafol has turned my hair around. It’s much thicker and longer than its been in a very long time.” – Laura (https://nutrafol.com/nutrafol-core-for-women/.)\n5. Natalist\nBest For | Affordable gummies\nNatural Ingredients | Organic tapioca syrup, organic cane sugar, vitamins C & E, zinc, biotin, hydrolyzed collagen\nPrice | $30 for 60 gummies (two daily)\nNatalist wants to support every stage of your reproductive health journey, from prenatal vitamins to postpartum gummies. The Biotin Plus Gummies were specifically made for moms dealing with hair loss, and they don’t just benefit your strands, but your overall health, too. Each gummy includes biotin of course, but there’s also hydrolyzed collagen, vitamins for antioxidant and immune system support, and organic sweeteners to go easy on the belly. And as for Natalist’s ethics? The brand is 100 percent plastic-neutral, manufactured in the US, and all products are FDA-registered. You’re two gummies a day away from your healthiest skin and hair.\n6. Perelel\nBest For | Multi-support pill packs\nNatural Ingredients | Vitamins A, C, D, E, B12, B6, K, DHA & EPA, biotin, choline, bovine collagen peptides, ashwagandha, L-theanine\nPrice | $59 for 30 pill packs (one daily); discounted subscriptions available\nFormulated by leading OB/GYNs, Perelel‘s Mom Multi is a comprehensive postnatal vitamin routine designed to support moms up to five years postpartum.

It’s also gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and non-GMO, ensuring high-quality, no-nausea ingredients for optimal wellness.\nCustomer Review | “After having my first baby I felt so sluggish and cranky, my hair was thinning, and my skin was breaking out badly. Immediately after having my second baby I started taking the mom multi support pack and I’ve noticed a huge difference in how I feel and look. My mood and energy levels are better and my skin, hair, and nails, are much healthier. I feel like I’m thinking more clearly as well. Really great product.” – Annabel F. (https://perelelhealth.sjv.io/c/274622/1911933/22949?subId1=bm-web--&u=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2Fproducts%2Fmom-multi-support-pack.)\nThe Good Trade Partner\n7. Divi\nBest For | Scalp serum\nNatural Ingredients | Copper tripeptide-1, caffeine, tea tree oil, amino acids, hyaluronic acid\nPrice | $48 for 30-day supply; discounted subscriptions available\nIf you prefer serums for hair growth rather than adding another daily capsule to your rotation, check out Divi‘s Scalp Serum. This clinically-tested serum focuses on creating a healthy scalp environment rather than just treating existing hair. (So you can experience new and healthy scalp growth!) With daily use, 90% of users saw their hair looking fuller, and 87% noticed increased density, thanks to the powerful mix of amino acids, caffeine, peptides, and rosemary oil. Plus, it’s vegan, cruelty-free, and made in the USA!\nCustomer Review | “I experienced hair loss from hormonal issues and this has helped grow back all that was lost!!!! Love love Divi” – Rebekah M.

With consistent daily use, these supplements can lead to visible results within 90 days!\nCustomer Review | “I have been taking Wellbell for over a year now (since last June) and I have not skipped a day of my three pills a days regimen.
