  "text": "The Best Natural Methods For Lash Lifting\nEyelashes Are Trending\nIf you’ve ever tried fake eyelashes, you may have discovered achieving Bambi eyes isn’t an entirely painless (or affordable) beauty trend. Lash extensions and lifts require maintenance and care, and the chemicals used along the way are rarely safe for you or the environment. This goes for the toxic glues used in single-use drugstore lashes, too.\nThe good news is, Mother Nature has us covered. Though we believe that each person is beautiful as they are, we also get that it can feel good to have thicker, longer, or just healthier lashes. And for that, we turn to plant-based oils and remedies.\nHere are a few of our favorite natural methods—and then a couple of our favorite natural products for when we’re feeling less DIY. Top off with natural mascara and a few of our other favorite organic makeup products.\n*When using oils, we recommend ones which are cold-pressed, fair trade, and/or organic.\nAt-Home Methods For Lash Lifting\nApplication: Use a small mascara wand and apply a few drops at night after washing your face. You can also use a Q-Tip or your fingers to coat lashes gently. Apply faithfully for three to six months to begin seeing results!\n1. Castor Oil\nOne of the most talked-about oils for lifting lashes is castor oil—a vegetable oil derived from seeds of a plant native to tropical areas in Africa and Asia. It’s a thick and glossy liquid with a yellowish tint, and it’s touted as one of nature’s best for healthier and longer lashes.\nCastor oil is mostly ricinoleic acid, an omega fatty acid which nourishes brittle and fine hairs, spurring health and growth. The oil is also rich in vitamin E, which repairs damaged follicles and prevents further breakage. It also includes properties that moisturize and hydrate even the most delicate of lashes.\nOur Picks\nAura Cacia Organic Castor Oil| $14.99 / 16 ozMaker + Merchant Just Castor Oil| $22 / 4 ozAllpa Botanicals Castor Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n2. Grapeseed Oil\nGrapeseed oil has been used for beauty, skin care, and natural health remedies for centuries. It’s made from leftover pressed grape seeds from winemaking, and many historians believe it was used for medicinal purposes in ancient Greece.\nWith its linoleic acid content (an omega 6 fatty acid to combat hair loss), this lightweight oil is ideal for long and luscious lashes. It also contains vitamin E, which is loved for its moisturizing and strengthening abilities.\nOur Picks\nNow Foods Grapeseed Oil| $10.99 / 16 ozMaker + Merchant Just Grapeseed Oil| $22 / 4 ozAllpa Botanicals Grapeseed Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n3. Jojoba Oil\nJojoba oil is a golden liquid extracted from Jojoba seeds; the shrubby plant is native to the dry, southern regions of Arizona and California and parts of northwestern Mexico. The oil is loved for its abundance of rich vitamins and minerals, including vitamin E, which, as mentioned above, is essential for healing damaged hair.\nAs an eyelash enhancer, jojoba oil is a favorite because it moisturizes, protects follicles, and encourages growth. It has regenerative properties as well, and, when used loyally, it is said to gift longer and thicker lashes.\nOur Picks\nhttps://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-7880526-12529075?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthrivemarket.com%2Fweb%2Fp%2Fnow-foods-jojoba-oil| $39.99 / 16 ozAllpa Botanicals Jojoba Hair Oil| $27 / 2 oz\n4. Aloe Vera\nAloe vera is one of those plants with a laundry list of health and skincare benefits, and it’s beloved for gifting lashes a natural shine. The gel even has antibacterial and antifungal properties to combat infections that may harm your hair and prevent growth. The best part is, many of us already have this lanky succulent growing in our homes. Here’s how to cut up and scoop the juice from the leaves.\nFor lash lifting, aloe vera gel is best used in conjunction with other oils—many DIY beauty bloggers recommend combining it with castor/jojoba oil, mixing one part oil with one part gel.\nOur Picks\nAubrey Organics Pure Aloe Vera Gel| $8.79 / 4 ozBeauty By Earth Aloe Vera Gel| $19.99 / 8 ozMountain Rose Herbs Aloe Vera Gel| $4.75 / 8 oz\nNatural & Eco-Friendly Products\n1.
