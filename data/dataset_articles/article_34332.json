  "text": "9 Best Probiotics For Gut Health (Seed v Ritual v AG1)\nThe Good Trade editors endorse products we’ve personally researched, tested, and genuinely love. Learn more about our methodology and business model here.\nWe’ve researched and tested dozens of probiotics for women’s gut health —these are our top picks for their natural, high quality ingredients and potent AFUs/CFUs.\nLooking to support your gut health? Us too. Gut health is essential to wellness and feeling good in our bodies, as “our microbiome…helps to shape our immune system,” according to transplant gastroenterologist Dr. Shilpa Ravella. Since a large portion of our immune system lives in the gut, it’s important to nourish our gut microbiota through promoting antibodies production, and reducing inflammation—all of which probiotics do! Probiotics support our gut health in more ways than one. From balancing bacteria in the gut, to improving digestive health, managing IBS, and even mood and cognitive function, a high quality probiotic goes a long way.\nSeed vs. AG1 vs. Ritual – What makes a good probiotic?\nWith all the information out there on the types and strains of probiotics that help support our gut needs, it can be confusing to know where to start. That’s why when choosing the best probiotic for gut health, it’s important to consider the following:\n-Strain Type & Diversity: A good probiotic should specify which strains are in their product, as some strains can support certain health needs better or have unique properties and benefits. Generally, a probiotic with a highly diverse strain composition is more beneficial to gut heath.\n–Shelf Stability & Survivability: Since probiotics are living organisms, they won’t be of much help if they are not active. A good probiotic will list whether it’s shelf-stable or requires refrigeration (both options are good!), and its guaranteed potency through its expiry date. Also ensuring the probiotic you choose offers a timed release or enteric-coating is beneficial, as these both protect probiotics from harsh stomach acids, which can reduce their effectiveness before they reach your intestines.\n–Synbiotic Formula: While most probiotics don’t contain pre- or post- biotics, formulas that do will help probiotics thrive, grow and remain active. (We’ve included ones that do in this list!) With synbiotic formulas, you’ll achieve better and more well-rounded support that assists in feeding the healthy bacteria in the gut and maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier.\n–AFU: While CFU is common in assessing how many living and reproducing microorganisms are in a probiotic supplement, AFU offers a more functional and accurate representation of microorganism count. AFU assesses how many living and metabolically active cells exist using a fluorescent dye test, whereas CFU involves counting colonies through a culture sample (which thrives only in certain conditions). Through this assessment, AFU measurements provide valuable insight into the viability and ability of microorganisms to survive under different conditions, which is a crucial factor in the effectiveness of a good probiotic. It’s important to note that neither one is necessarily better than the other, simply AFU provides a much more accurate snapshot of microorganism count than CFU.\nNow, when it comes to effective probiotic options, Seed, AG1, and Ritual are popular choices on the market, but how do they compare? When it comes to strain type and diversity, Seed takes the lead with 24 probiotic strains that support digestive, skin, and cardiovascular health. Both Seed and Ritual are shelf-stable and offer delayed release, and all three formulas offer synbiotic properties. When it comes to AFU/CFU count, Seed has 53.6 billion AFU, Ritual has 11 billion CFU, and AG1 has 7.2 billion CFU.\nRitual is a great choice if your looking for daily gut support, while Seed is an option to turn to if you require a higher level of digestive and whole body support. We recommend AG1 if you’re always on the go and have a harder time meeting your nutrition goals as it contains over 75 ingredients to help support whole body health, in addition to probiotics. When comparing these three products, there are areas where one thrives over another–however we agree that each of these brands offers high quality formulas that will benefit your gut health needs.\nIn this guide, we’ve covered the ins and outs of what these popular probiotics offer, as well as a few more of our favorite brands, so you can make the most informed decision for your health.\nOur criteria:\n- NATURAL, HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS | Each of these probiotics is made from ingredients that are naturally sourced, tested, and proven effective. No fillers, gums, or binders here!\n- AFFORDABILITY | We’ve offered a variety of options at various price points, while prioritizing more affordable choices for better accessibility.\n- ACTIVE FLUORESCENT UNITS (AFU) | We’ve done the work for you by including the best brands that provide detailed CFU count (and AFU where available).\nThe below brands are the best of the best when it comes to science-backed and clinically proven pre-, pro- and postbiotics. From third-party testing to sustainable production to superb ingredients that ensure our guts are healthy and happy, these gut health supplements keep everything regular and flowing. 😉\nIf you’re look to up your supplement routine to more natural products with organic ingredients, we’ve got you covered with our guides on best magnesium supplements, fiber supplements, and women’s multivitamins to help keep your health in tip-top shape.\n**This review is not health advice.

From suffering for nearly 4 years with bad digestive issues, this was my last ditch effort before doing exploratory scans and colonoscopies.

I haven’t had but maybe two or three “flare ups” (diarrhea) in almost 4 months.
