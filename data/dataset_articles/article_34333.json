  "text": "(ST. JOSEPH, Mo.) On Nov. 11, 2024, Missouri Western State University's Nursing Program and Mosaic Life Care entered a new partnership to provide financial, academic and career support to nursing students. Mosaic and the university will cover three years of tuition for students and give them opportunities to work at Mosaic, thanks to the Nursing Scholars of Promise (NSP) program. Missouri Western State University President Elizabeth Kennedy said \"Even though Missouri Western has the fourth lowest cost tuition in the state, reducing cost is always one of our goals. So talking with Mosaic and looking at what their needs were, you know, so many of our graduates go into Mosaic to work.\" \"They'll have a special mentor, and this will be someone who will help them academically when they begin as freshmen, to make sure that they're doing well in their courses. They'll also have the opportunity to work part time at Mosaic, 12 hours a week during the academic year and summer, if that works out, which is always helpful for our students,\" Kennedy concluded. With the new partnership, Mosaic Life Care CEO, Mike Poore, is excited to continue using the hospital as a learning environment for students. Poore said \"If you're able to work in the hospital, you understand that a nurse is not a nurse. That's not a nurse. There are oncology nurses and intensive care nurses and (OR) nurses, and the ability to work in the hospital before you become a nurse, gets you to understand where your interest may be and focus on what you wanted to be as a nurse getting out. \"I mean, I'll hire every nurse that graduates from here. They have such a great program. You know, we talked about the NCLEX, 100% pass rate that really talks to the quality of nurse that we have here, but more of it too is that these students actually get to work inside our hospital, that they'll have opportunities to work inside our hospital,\" Poore concluded.
