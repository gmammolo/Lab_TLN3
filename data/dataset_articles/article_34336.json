  "text": "- Research\n-\nOpen access - Published:\nTetrahedral framework nucleic acids inhibit Aβ-mediated ferroptosis and ameliorate cognitive and synaptic impairments in Alzheimer’s disease\n[Journal of Nanobiotechnology](/)\nvolume 22, Article number: 682 (2024)\n[Cite this article](#citeas)\nAbstract\nBackground\nFerroptosis represents a nonapoptotic type of programmed cell death induced by excessive intracellular iron accumulation. Ferroptosis is an essential driver of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) are a novel type of nanoparticle with superior antiapoptotic capacity and excellent biocompatibility. However, the effect of tFNAs on Aβ triggered ferroptosis, cognitive and synaptic impairments in AD remains unknown.\nMethods\nN2a cells were treated with Aβ combined with/without tFNAs. Cell viability and levels of Fe2+, lipid peroxidation, MDA, LDH, and GSH were examined. RNA sequencing was applied to explore dysregulated ferroptosis related genes. Seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice were intranasally administrated with tFNAs for two weeks. Fluorescence imaging was used to detect the tFNAs distribution in the brain. Novel object recognition (NOR) test followed by Morris water maze (MWM) was used to test the learning and memory performance of mice. Golgi staining, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were used to examine synaptic plasticity.\nResults\ntFNAs promoted cell viability and GSH levels, reduced the levels of Fe2+, lipid peroxidation, MDA, and LDH in N2a cells treated with Aβ. RNA sequencing revealed that tFNAs reversed the promotive effect of Aβ on ferroptosis driver Atf3 gene and suppressive effect on ferroptosis suppressors Rrm2 and Furin genes. Fluorescence imaging confirmed the brain infiltration of tFNAs. tFNAs rescued synaptic and memory impairments, and ferroptosis in seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice.\nConclusions\nCollectively, tFNAs inhibited Aβ-mediated ferroptosis and ameliorated cognitive and synaptic impairments in AD mice. tFNAs may serve as novel option to deal with AD.\nGraphical abstract\nIntroduction\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia globally, marked by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau [[1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR1)]. Despite considerable research efforts, therapeutic interventions targeting Aβ and tau have yielded limited achievements, underscoring the need for treatment strategies.\nRecent studies have highlighted the role of metal ion dyshomeostasis, particularly iron, in AD pathology [[2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR2)]. Iron, a redox-active metal, can exacerbate oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to neuronal damage, Aβ plaque deposition, and tau aggregation [[3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR3), [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR4)]. Iron dysregulation is closely associated with the progression of AD, as elevated iron levels are observed in the hippocampus of AD patients, correlating with tissue damage and cognitive impairment [[5](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR5)]. Thus, alleviating iron overload and mitigating iron-induced oxidative stress represents a promising therapeutic avenue for AD.\nOne specific process linked to iron toxicity in AD is ferroptosis-a form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation and dependent on intracellular iron accumulation [[6](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR6)]. Ferroptosis has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, where iron overload triggers neuronal death through oxidative damage [[7](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR7)]. Studies have shown that inhibition of ferroptosis can protect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, and several ferroptosis inhibitors, such as ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in experimental AD models [[2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR2), [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR8), [9](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR9)]. This emerging understanding of ferroptosis underscores its potential as a target for novel AD therapies.\nTetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) are a novel class of DNA nanostructures that exhibit unique biological properties, including high biocompatibility, tissue permeability, and the ability to modulate cellular processes [[10](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR10)]. Recent studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of tFNAs in models of AD, where they reduce oxidative stress and inhibit apoptosis [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11)]. tFNAs’ structure allows them to be easily modified, offering potential as drug delivery vehicles. However, whether tFNAs can specifically modulate ferroptosis in AD remains largely unexplored.\nHowever, delivering drugs to the brain poses significant challenges due to the complex and selective nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [[12](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR12)]. Intranasal administration has been shown to bypass the BBB and efficiently deliver drugs into the brain through a non-invasive route [[13](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR13)]. In previous studies, Shao et al. utilized specific DNA sequences to construct tFNAs, demonstrating their neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models of AD [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11), [14](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR14)]. These sequences were shown to form stable, biocompatible tFNAs that effectively reduce oxidative stress and inhibit neuronal apoptosis. We selected the same sequences to explore whether tFNAs could also directly suppress ferroptosis in AD models. The resulting tFNAs could be detected in the brain and were found to ameliorate Aβ-induced cognitive and synaptic impairments by inhibiting Aβ-mediated ferroptosis.\nMethods\nPreparation of tFNAs\nThe DNA sequences S1, S2, S3, and S4 used to construct the tFNAs were selected based on their demonstrated efficacy in previous studies [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11), [14](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR14), [15](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR15)], having been validated to form stable, biocompatible structures capable of effectively penetrating neuronal PC12 cells, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting apoptosis. The single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) sequences (listed in Table [S1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)) were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), and tFNAs were constructed following established protocols [[15](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR15), [16](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR16)]. In brief, four ssDNA strands (each at 100 µM) were mixed in TM buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0) and denatured at 95 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then rapidly cooled to 4 °C and maintained at this temperature for 20 min using a T100 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) to facilitate proper folding and assembly. The successful synthesis and structural integrity of the tFNAs were confirmed using several characterization techniques. Images of tFNAs were obtained with the Benyuan CSPM5500 atomic force microscope (AFM) (Guangzhou, China) after pre-treating the mica plate with poly-L-lysine and incubating a 50 pM tFNAs solution on the mica surface for 30 min. The zeta potential of tFNAs was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS90 nanoparticle analyzer (Worcestershire, UK) at a concentration of 100 pM in a 1 mL electrode cell. Additionally, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed to characterize the molecular size of tFNAs.\nCell viability analysis\nCell viability was assessed using CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo Laboratory, Japan). Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured under conditions specified by the experimental design. Subsequently, 100 µL of CCK-8 reagent was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 ℃. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was then measured to determine cell viability.\nLipid peroxidation analysis\nBODIPY 581/591 C11 (Lipid Peroxidation Sensor) (Invitrogen, USA) was employed to detect ROS in cells seeded in 12-well plates. Cells were incubated with 10 µM Lipid Peroxidation Sensor for 30 min at 37 ℃ in complete growth medium. Following incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and flow cytometry was conducted using FACS analysis (FACScan; BD Biosciences, USA) to capture fluorescent images and quantify the mean fluorescence intensity with FlowJo 10.8 software. Data were collected from a minimum of 20,000 cells.\nMeasurement of MDA, GSH, and LDH levels\nMeasurement of MDA\nCellular lipid peroxidation was examined with a Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The relative levels were determined by measuring the optical density values at 531 nm using a microplate reader. The concentrations corresponding to each OD value were calculated and expressed in terms of µmol/mg protein.\nMeasurement of GSH/GSSG ratio\nThe intracellular levels of GSH and glutathione disulphide (GSSG) were assessed with a GSH Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The relative levels were analyzed using a microplate reader.\nMeasurement of LDH\nLDH leakage was detected using an LDH cytotoxicity detection kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The relative levels of LDH were quantified by recording the OD values at 490 nm with a microplate reader.\nMeasurement of iron ions\nThe intracellular iron concentration was assessed using FerroOrange (Dojindo Laboratory, Japan) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Cells were seeded into dishes and stained with 1 µM FerroOrange for 30 min at 37 ℃. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and examined under a confocal microscope. To quantify the Fe2+ levels in brain tissue, the Ferrous Iron Colorimetric Assay Kit (Elabscience, China) was employed. The relative levels were determined by measuring the OD values at 593 nm. The concentrations for each optical density OD were quantified in terms of µmol/kg wet weight.\nWestern blot\nSamples of tissues or cultured cells were collected on ice, then mixed with a RIPA lysis buffer solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF). This mixture was centrifuged at a speed of 12,000 g for a duration of 15 min. The resulting supernatant was extracted for soluble protein analysis. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay method. Proteins from each sample, in equal quantities, were loaded onto 8–15% SDS-PAGE gels for electrophoresis, followed by transfer to 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Merck Millipore, USA). The membranes were treated with a 5% nonfat milk solution to prevent non-specific binding, then incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in figure, and subsequently to horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. The immunoblots were visualized using an ECL substrate with a luminometer (ChemiScope 6000, Clinx, China), and the signal intensities were quantified with the ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA. The list of antibodies used in this study was shown in Table [S2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1).\nRNA sequencing\nFor RNA-sequencing, the three groups of N2a cells (Scramble, Aβ, and Aβ with tFNAs) were harvested and each group contained four replicates. RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and the library was prepared and sequenced with TruSeq PE Cluster Kit (Illumina, MD, USA) on Novaseq platform by Novogene Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Clean reads were mapped to mm10 reference genome using Hisat2 (v2.0.5), and the count matrix was obtained with featureCounts (v1.5.0). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using DESeq2 (v1.20.0) using the count matrix. Genes with a P-value < 0.05 and absolute value of log (fold change) greater than 0 were assigned as significant DEGs. The normalized FPKM values were used to display the expression level in heatmap.\nAnimals\nThe current study was approved by the ethnic committee of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Both the C57BL/6 background wild type and APP/PS1 mice were maintained with a normal diet on a 12 h light-dark cycle. Intranasal administration of tFNAs was performed for two weeks using a pipette with 10 µL 500 nM tFNAs. Then the behavior tests were performed, and mice were sacrificed.\nOptical in vivo imaging\nMice were administered 500 nM of Cy5 or Cy5-labeled tFNAs intranasally. Fluorescence was detected using a multi-mode in vivo imaging system (Model: B Pro, Wuhan BIOVIVO, China). In brief, mice were shaved, imaging was performed using a 200 mm field of view. An excitation wavelength of 630 nm with a bandwidth of 30 nm was chosen to excite the brain, and the emitted light signal was detected at a primary wavelength of 680 nm with a bandwidth of 40 nm. The fluorescence signal exposure time was set to 1 s.\nMorris water maze\nIn the Morris water maze (MWM) experiment, designed to assess spatial learning, mice were trained over a five-day period to locate a submerged platform positioned in a specific quadrant of the maze. Each day, they were subjected to three trials, spaced 30 min apart. For each trial, the mice began from a different quadrant, facing the pool wall, and the trial concluded once the mouse had climbed onto the platform for a minimum of three seconds. If the platform was not discovered within a 60-second timeframe, the mouse was manually directed to the platform and remain there for 15 s. Evaluation of spatial memory was conducted on the seventh day. Throughout the experiment, the mice’s swimming paths, the time taken to locate the platform (referred to as latency), the time spent in the target zone, and their swimming speed were all tracked and analyzed daily. This was achieved using a stationary video camera mounted on the ceiling, positioned two meters above the water surface (Techman, Chengdu, China).\nNovel object recognition test\nIn the novel object recognition (NOR) test, mice were initially acclimated to a 50 cm by 50 cm arena for a duration of 5 min, devoid of any objects, the day before the actual experiment. On the training day, the mice were reintroduced to the arena from a consistent starting point and were given 5 min to explore two distinct objects labeled A and B. Following each exploration session, both the arena and the objects were meticulously cleaned with a 75% ethanol solution to eliminate any olfactory cues. On the test day, object B was removed and replaced with a new object, C. The mice were then allowed another 5 min to investigate both objects A and C. The entire behavior of the mice was captured and analyzed using a video camera that was mounted above the arena (Techman, Chengdu, China). The duration in which the mice interacted with object A was denoted as TA, and the time spent with the novel object C was denoted as TC. The recognition index, an indicator of the mice’s ability to discriminate between familiar and novel objects, was determined using the formula: TC divided by the sum of TA and TC (TC / (TA + TC)).\nGolgi staining\nMice were deeply anesthetized with a 2% pentobarbital sodium solution prior to brain extraction. The excised brains were immediately immersed in Solution A/B for 14 days at room temperature. Solution A consists of 5% potassium dichromate and 5% mercury chloride in H2O, and Solution B contains 5% potassium chromate in H2O. Following this, the brains were transferred to Solution C, which was prepared by dissolving 300 g sucrose, 10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP40), and 300 mL ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) in 500 mL phosphate buffer, and incubated at 4 °C for 7 days. After incubation, the brains were sectioned into 100-micrometer slices using a Vibratome VT1200S (Leica, Germany). Spine imaging of the brain slices was performed using a Nikon Ni-E microscope (Japan). Spine quantification were conducted using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).\nImmunofluorescence staining\nMouse brain tissue was first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 3-µm thickness slices. After deparaffinization, the slices were blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature before being exposed to primary antibodies (SYP, GLUR2, and NR2B dilution 1:100). The slides were rinsed and then treated with a secondary antibody for an hour at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using the DAPI fluorescent stain. The cells’ fluorescence was observed under a LSM800 confocal microscope from Carl Zeiss in Germany.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26 (IBM, NY, USA). Data were shown as mean ± SD. Two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for single comparisons, and one-way ANOVA was applied for multiple comparisons.\nResults\nSynthesis and characterizations of tFNAs\ntFNAs were composed of four equal amounts of ssDNA (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig1)a, b). Successfully synthesized tFNAs were identified by PAGE (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig1)c), which showed a consistent molecular size with previous reports [[17](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR17)]. AFM was used to observe the morphology of tFNAs, confirming their expected structure (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig1)d). Dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the tFNAs were negatively charged, with a zeta potential of − 20.3 ± 0.5 mV (Fig. [1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig1)e). These results indicated the successful synthesis of tFNAs.\ntFNAs attenuated Aβ induced ferroptosis\nRecent studies have shown that Aβ increased iron content, decreased GPX4 levels, and induced ferroptosis in AD models [[2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR2)]. We assessed the effects of various concentrations of tFNAs on cell viability and found that tFNAs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 nM did not affect the viability of N2a cells. However, higher concentrations of 800 nM and 1000 nM significantly reduced N2a cell viability (Fig. [S1](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)).\nWe then examined the effect of tFNAs on Aβ-induced ferroptosis at three different concentrations (100 nM, 250 nM, and 400 nM) to assess potential dose-dependent effects. These concentrations were chosen based on previous studies that demonstrated significant neuroprotective effects of tFNAs at 250 nM in PC12 cells treated with Aβ25–35 [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11), [14](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR14)].\nOur findings showed that tFNAs effectively protected N2a cells from Aβ-induced cytotoxicity, as indicated by a significant increase in cell viability at 250 nM (Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig2)a), consistent with previous study [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11)]. Based on these findings, we used 250 nM tFNAs for all subsequent cell experiments. Additionally, a reduction in LDH leakage was observed in tFNAs-treated N2a cells exposed to Aβ (Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig2)b). tFNAs also significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, demonstrated by decreased levels of oxidized lipids and MDA (Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig2)c, d), and reversed Aβ-induced Fe2+ accumulation (Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig2)e). The System Xc−/GSH/GPX4 axis is crucial for eliminating ROS accumulation [[18](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR18)], and our results showed that tFNAs activated this pathway, evidenced by increased levels of GSH, GPX4, and SLC7A11 (Fig. [2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig2)f, g). Collectively, these data suggest that tFNAs could mitigate Aβ-induced ferroptosis in vitro, supporting their potential as a therapeutic approach in AD by modulating ferroptosis.\ntFNAs regulated the expression of ferroptosis related genes\nTo explore the underlying mechanism of tFNAs against Aβ-induced ferroptosis, RNA sequencing was performed on N2a cells in three groups: scramble control, Aβ, and Aβ with tFNAs treatment (Aβ + tFNA). A total of 12,568 intersected genes were sequenced across all three groups (Fig. [S2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)). We identified 574 upregulated and 257 downregulated DEGs between Aβ and scramble groups, while 1,845 upregulated and 1,568 downregulated DEGs were identified between the Aβ + tFNA and Aβ groups (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig3)a, b, Tables [S3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1), [S4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)). We cross-referenced these DEGs with ferroptosis driver and suppressor genes from FerrDb V2 [[19](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR19)]. Upregulated DEGs between Aβ and scramble groups, downregulated DEGs between the Aβ + tFNA and Aβ groups, and ferroptosis driver genes were intersected to identify ferroptosis driver genes increased by Aβ but reversed by tFNAs. The ferroptosis driver gene activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) was upregulated by Aβ and reversed by tFNAs (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig3)c, Table [S5](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)). In contrast, the ferroptosis suppressor genes ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (Rrm2) and Furin were downregulated by Aβ and reversed by tFNAs (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig3)d, Table [S6](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)). A heat map illustrated the expression of Atf3, Rrm2, and Furin across all samples (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig3)e). Western blot further confirmed the changes in Atf3, Rrm2, and Furin observed in RNA sequencing (Fig. [3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig3)f). These results indicate that tFNAs protected against Aβ-induced ferroptosis, potentially by regulating the expression of ferroptosis-related genes.\ntFNAs ameliorated cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 mice\nWe further investigated the protective effects of tFNAs in vivo. Nissl staining revealed that 1000 nM tFNAs led to remarkably neuronal loss in the hippocampus of wild type mice (Fig. [S3](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)). Based on these findings, a concentration of 500 nM tFNAs was selected for intranasal administration in mice. Following intranasal treatment of 10 µL tFNAs, cognitive function was assessed using the NOR test and the MWM (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)a). To confirm that tFNAs reached the brain via intranasal delivery, Cy5-labeled tFNAs were used, and fluorescence was detected. Cy5 fluorescence was clearly visible 1 h after intranasal administration (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)b). Brain slices showed that the red Cy5 fluorescence of tFNAs was stronger than Cy5 alone in hippocampus (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)c). Moreover, in the CA3 region, the red Cy5 fluorescence was prominently present and enriched around the nuclei of the hippocampus (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)d), indicating the enrichment of tFNAs in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus.\nSeven-month-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited a longer time to find the hidden platform during the training phase and decreased crossing times in the platform region during the test phase of the MWM (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)e-g). tFNAs treatment resulted in shorter latency and more frequent platform crossing compared with untreated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)e-g). In the NOR test, APP/PS1 mice displayed a reduced preference for the novel object compared with wild type mice, but tFNAs treatment rescued memory impairments (Fig. [4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig4)h, i). tFNAs treatment did not affect the body weight and swimming speed of mice (Fig. [S4](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#MOESM1)a, b). These results indicate that tFNAs may reach the hippocampus via intranasal administration and significantly improve cognitive impairments in seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice in both MWM and NOR tests.\ntFNAs reversed synaptic dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice\nSynaptic dysfunction is a major contributor to learning and memory impairments in AD [[20](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR20)]. Golgi staining was used to analyze synaptic morphology. The dendritic spine density was significantly reduced in seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice, and tFNAs treatment notably increased the number of dendritic spines (Fig. [5](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig5)a, b). Several pre-synaptic proteins, including Synapsin I (SYN), synaptophysin (SYP), and synaptotagmin-1 (SYT), and post-synaptic proteins, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B), glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2 (GLUR2), and density protein 95 (PSD95), were detected using Western blot. tFNAs treatment significantly restored the protein levels of both pre- and post-synaptic markers (Fig. [5](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig5)c), which were significantly decreased in APP/PS1 mice. Consistent with Western blot findings, the immunofluorescence results showed a significant restoration of SYP, GLUR2, and NR2B protein levels in the tFNAs-treated APP/PS1 mice (Fig. [6](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig6)a-c). These results suggest that tFNAs may ameliorate learning and memory impairments by reversing synaptic dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice.\ntFNAs ameliorated ferroptosis in APP/PS1 mice\nThe in vivo anti-ferroptosis effects of tFNAs in APP/PS1 mice were also examined. Consistent with in vitro findings, tFNAs treatment decreased MDA levels and iron accumulation, while increasing GSH levels in seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice (Fig. [7](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig7)a-c). The protein levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11 were significantly reduced in APP/PS1 mice, but tFNAs restored their protein levels (Fig. [7](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig7)d). Consistent with the cellular results, the protein levels of the ferroptosis driver Atf3 were upregulated, while those of the ferroptosis suppressors Rrm2 and Furin were downregulated APP/PS1 mice; these changes were significantly reversed following tFNAs treatment (Fig. [7](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig7)d). These findings indicate that tFNAs may ameliorate ferroptosis in APP/PS1 mice.\nThe anti-ferroptosis effect of tFNAs was Aβ-dependent\nTo assess whether the effects of tFNAs were specifically targeted against Aβ-induced alterations or if they might have broader biological impacts that could complicate their therapeutic potential, we conducted experiments in which tFNAs were administered alone to both cell cultures and mice without Aβ treatment. The results indicated that tFNAs alone did not lead to Fe²⁺ accumulation (Fig. [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig8)a), lipid peroxidation (Fig. [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig8)b), or any significant changes in the protein levels of ferroptosis-related genes in N2a cells (Fig. [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig8)c). Likewise, tFNAs treatment did not affect the protein levels of ferroptosis markers (Fig. [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig8)d) or synaptic proteins (Fig. [8](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig8)e-h) in wild-type mice. These findings suggest that the anti-ferroptosis effects of tFNAs are specifically dependent on the presence of Aβ.\nDiscussion\nNeuronal cell death and loss are early events in the progression of AD. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death and accumulating evidences demonstrate the contribution of ferroptosis to the pathogenesis of AD. Ferroptosis inhibitors relieved AD-related pathological impairments in AD. Targeting ferroptosis is considered as a novel strategy for prevention and treatment and of AD [[21](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR21)]. Our choice to utilize the specific sequences S1, S2, S3, and S4 for tFNA construction was informed by their demonstrated effectiveness in previous studies, where they showed significant neuroprotective properties [[11](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR11), [14](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR14)]. Based on the anti-ferroptosis effects of tFNAs observed in a cisplatin-induced renal injury cell model, we hypothesized that tFNAs might also modulate ferroptosis in a neurological context. tFNAs are a novel type of nanoparticle with excellent biocompatibility and superior antiapoptotic capacity. Moreover, tFNAs serve as nanocarriers for drugs delivery via modification. We demonstrated that tFNAs mitigated Aβ induced ferroptosis. Suppression of Atf3 and promotion of Rrm2 and Furin may be involved in the anti-ferroptosis effect. Moreover, tFNAs could ameliorate cognitive deficits and synaptic dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice partially through inhibition of ferroptosis (Fig. [9](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#Fig9)).\nAβ has been reported to induce a variety types of cell death, including autophagy, necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis [[22](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR22)]. Zhou X et al. revealed that Aβ induced ferroptosis in two types of commonly used nerve cells, SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells, as evidenced by decreased cell viability, LDH accumulation, increased ROS and MDA generation and inhibition of FTH1 and GPX4. Treatment with ferroptosis suppressor Fer-1 remarkably reversed Aβ induced ferroptosis [[23](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR23)]. Several natural compounds have been found to play protective role against ferroptosis in Aβ related AD animal models [[24](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR24), [25](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR25)]. Eriodictyol ameliorated cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting ferroptosis [[24](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR24)]. We found that 5 µM Aβ decreased cell viability, promoted LDH release, increased levels of MDA, Fe2+, and lipid peroxidation, while decreased GSH levels in N2a cells. Treatment with tFNAs substantially reduced cell death, LDH release, Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation, reversed GSH level, displaying preventive effect on Aβ-induced ferroptosis.\nFerroptosis is dynamically regulated by ferroptosis drivers and suppressors. We analyzed the gene lists of ferroptosis drivers and suppressors and intersected these with DEGs from Aβ vs. scramble and Aβ + tFNA vs. Aβ comparisons. Notably, we found that the ferroptosis driver gene Atf3, was upregulated by Aβ stimulation but downregulated following tFNAs treatment. Atf3 has been shown to suppress Slc7a11 expression and promote ferroptosis in sorafenib-treated hepatocellular carcinoma model [[26](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR26)], and it is also involved in brucine-triggered ferroptosis by increasing hydrogen peroxide and iron levels in glioma cells [[27](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR27)]. Additionally, tFNAs treatment upregulated the expression of Rrm2 and Furin, both of which were downregulated by Aβ. RRM2 has been reported to inhibit ferroptosis by maintaining GSH synthesis and is a suggested biomarker for liver and lung cancers [[28](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR28), [29](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR29)]. Similarly, Furin overexpression has been shown to reduce ferroptosis via increased GPX4 expression in ulcerative colitis models [[30](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR30)].\nConsistent with these findings, in APP/PS1 mice, the protein level of the ferroptosis driver Atf3 was elevated, while the levels of the ferroptosis suppressors Rrm2 and Furin were reduced. Treatment with tFNAs significantly reversed these changes, aligning with the cellular data, further supporting the role of tFNAs in modulating ferroptosis-related pathways in AD. Our additional control experiments further validated the specificity of tFNAs’ effects on Aβ-induced ferroptosis. In the absence of Aβ, tFNAs did not lead to Fe²⁺ accumulation, lipid peroxidation, or changes in the levels of ferroptosis-related genes in N2a cells. Similarly, tFNAs treatment did not alter the expression of ferroptosis markers or synaptic proteins in wild-type mice. These findings indicate that the anti-ferroptosis effects of tFNAs are specifically Aβ-dependent, confirming that the observed therapeutic benefits are not the result of broader, nonspecific biological effects. This Aβ-specific action underscores the targeted therapeutic potential of tFNAs in modulating ferroptosis in AD models. These results suggest that the anti-ferroptosis effects of tFNAs may be due to their regulation of key ferroptosis driver and suppressor genes.\nThe BBB restricts drug penetration, reducing the therapeutic dose in the brain in the condition of systemic administration [[31](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR31)]. Intranasal administration is a non-invasive strategy of delivering pharmacological compounds to the brain which overcomes the limitation of drug metabolic stability and BBB permeability, and increases the therapeutic concentration to the brain [[32](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR32)]. Intranasal delivery occurs in an extracellular route along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways, without binding to any receptor. Moreover, intranasal delivery minimizes the dose of therapeutic agents and reduces the side effects in turn. Intranasal delivery is becoming an increasingly used alternative for numerous agents, such as recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus, therapeutic peptide, and nanoparticles [[31](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR31), [33](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR33), [34](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR34)]. Efficacy of intranasal delivery in mice has been demonstrated in a variety of studies in AD models [[35](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR35)]. tFNAs possess outstanding structural stability, cell permeability, leading to great potential in anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammation process [[36](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR36)]. In this study, Cy5-labelled tFNAs could be detected via vivo imaging system 1 h later after intranasal delivery, and tFNAs were enriched in CA3 region of hippocampus in mice. These results expand the brain delivery methods for tFNAs.\nFerroptosis has been shown to cause synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment in AD model mice [[2](/articles/10.1186/s12951-024-02963-x#ref-CR2)]. In seven-month-old APP/PS1 mice, learning and memory deficits were prominent, but these cognitive impairments were ameliorated by tFNAs treatment. Additionally, tFNAs increased dendritic spine density in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and upregulated synaptic proteins that were significantly downregulated in untreated APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of SYP, GLUR2, and NR2B confirmed the restoration of these synaptic markers in tFNAs-treated APP/PS1 mice. These immunofluorescence results were consistent with Western blot, further supporting the role of tFNAs in mitigating synaptic dysfunction in the AD mouse model. As expected, tFNAs treatment inhibited ferroptosis in APP/PS1 mice, contributing to its protective effects on cognitive impairment.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, in this study, we adopted tFNAs to treat AD both in vitro and in vivo. We found that tFNAs could alleviate Aβ induced ferroptosis, partially by suppression of Atf3 and upregulation of Rrm2 and Furin. Furthermore, tFNAs ameliorated learning and memory impairments, synaptic dysfunction, and ferroptosis in APP/PS1 AD transgenic mice. Our study shed new light on the biological mechanism and clinical application of tFNAs in neurodegenerative disorders including AD.\nData availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author(s) upon reasonable request.\nAbbreviations\n- AD:\n-\nAlzheimer’s disease\n- NFTs:\n-\nNeurofibrillary tangles\n- ROS:\n-\nReactive oxygen species\n- GSH:\n-\nGlutathione\n- GPX4:\n-\nGlutathione peroxidase 4\n- Fer-1:\n-\nFerrostatin1\n- Lip-1:\n-\nLiproxstatin1\n- tFNAs:\n-\nTetrahedral framework nucleic acids\n- ssDNAs:\n-\nSingle-stranded DNAs\n- BBB:\n-\nBlood-brain barrier\n- AFM:\n-\nAtomic force microscopy\n- MDA:\n-\nMalondialdehyde\n- LDH:\n-\nLactate dehydrogenase\n- PAGE:\n-\nPolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n- MWM:\n-\nMorris water maze\n- NOR:\n-\nNovel object recognition\n- SYN:\n-\nSynapsin I\n- SYP:\n-\nSynaptophysin\n- SYT:\n-\nSynaptotagmin-1\n- NR2B:\n-\nN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B\n- GLUR2:\n-\nGlutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 2\n- PSD95:\n-\nDensity protein 95\n- Atf3:\n-\nActivating transcription factor 3\n- Rrm2:\n-\nRibonucleotide reductase subunit M2\nReferences\nScheltens P, De Strooper B, Kivipelto M, Holstege H, Chetelat G, Teunissen CE, et al.
