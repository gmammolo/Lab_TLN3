  "text": "The 3D Printing Resin is an FDA 510k-cleared sedimentation-free permanent denture light-cured resin.\nVOCO America has launched V-Print dentbase, a new permanent denture 3D printing resin for the production of removable permanent dentures. The 3D print resin is sedimentation-free, thus requires no shaking or rolling prior to use.\nV-Print dentbase comes in a natural gingival-shaded resin, can be polished to a high gloss, and results in esthetic denture bases with high patient satisfaction, according to VOCO. The material also is biocompatible with FDA 510k clearance, tasteless and odorless for patient comfort and it features a high green state strength that ensures dimensional stability after removal from the platform.\nV-print dentbase is compatible with all resins for characterization and with all standard reline materials for repairs, including the company’s award winning Ufi Gel reliners. Furthermore, it is validated for a variety of quality 3D printers, including those from Asiga, Dental Wings, RapidShape, Microlay, MiiCraft, Ackuretta, Shera, Straumann. And as with other V-Print resins, it is included in the design software from 3Shape and Exocad.\n[Pac-Dent Unveils New Resin Characterization System for Staining and Glazing Procedure for Printed Restorations](/view/pac-dent-unveils-new-resin-characterization-system-for-staining-and-glazing-procedure-for-printed-restorations?utm_source=www.dentalproductsreport.com&utm_medium=relatedContent)\nThe new Rodin® Glaze N2-Free and Rodin® Palette N2-Free Naturalizing Kit are designed for surface detailing across a wide range of dental restorations while enhancing workflow efficiency and patient satisfaction.\n[Product Bites – January 19, 2024](/view/product-bites-january-19-2024?utm_source=www.dentalproductsreport.com&utm_medium=relatedContent)\nProduct Bites makes sure you don't miss the next innovation for your practice.
