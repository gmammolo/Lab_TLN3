  "text": "Prisma Health announces $138M behavioral health hospital in Pickens County Prisma Health [announced Thursday](https://prismahealth.org/patients-and-guests/news/prisma-health-to-build-inpatient-behavioral-health-hospital) it will spend $138 million on a new 112-bed inpatient behavioral health hospital in Pickens County. Prisma will partner with the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and use $100 million in state-allocated funding for the new facility. It will replace the 65-bed [Marshall I. Pickens Psychiatric Hospital](https://prismahealth.org/locations/hospitals/marshall-i-pickens-hospital) located on the Memorial Hospital campus in Greenville. The facility will take about two years to build and will quadruple the number of beds available for children receiving inpatient mental health care, according to Prisma. Prisma president and chief executive Mark O’Halla said the project would not be possible without the state's investment. “This project is a powerful example of what we can accomplish through public-private partnerships and is a significant and much-needed step forward for our communities and state,\" O'Halla said in a statement. \"As a safety-net provider, Prisma Health is committed to caring for all patients, regardless of their ability to pay, which means operating the facility with an annual financial loss. This project is only possible due to the state’s investment, which enables us to meet the growing need for behavioral health care in our communities.\" The company hopes to begin site work in the spring. According to Prisma, the number of patients admitted for psychiatric treatment has risen nearly 50% over the last six years between Pickens, Oconee, and Greenville counties. MIPH opened in 1969 and serves about 1,500 patients each year. Prisma said about 1,200 patients coming to its Upstate emergency departments must be transported to other facilities. The MIPH facility has only 10 beds for children and adolescents. The new facility will be licensed for 40, offering more room for inpatient treatment. Prisma is the only Upstate hospital that admits psychiatric patients ages 12 or younger. The hospital will have private and semi-private rooms and the staff will offer specialized care for all ages including adults who require intensive care. South Carolina House Rep. Bruce Bannister (R-Greenville), House Ways and Means Committee chairperson, said the project is \"long overdue.\" \"The Prisma Health Marshall I. Pickens Psychiatric Hospital has served Greenville and Upstate families well for decades, and I am thrilled this public-private partnership will not only expand these services but expand access in the modern environment our community deserves,” Bannister said. Gov. Henry McMaster also expressed support for the new hospital. “South Carolina is no stranger to the behavioral health crisis sweeping our nation, and the inpatient and outpatient services in our state to support our citizens are woefully insufficient,” McMaster said. “This project is an important step forward in addressing the statewide need for an expansion of behavioral health services whenever and wherever possible.” In addition to the new hospital, Prisma committed to spending $7 million on behavioral health services, including expanding its intensive outpatient program at the Greenville Memorial Hospital campus. Prisma is the largest healthcare organization in the state and serves about 1.5 million patients annually across 21 counties.
