  "text": "This Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is my classic and–dare I say–perfect cream cheese pound cake with a cinnamon-sugar layer in the center and a sweet glaze drizzled on top. It’s perfectly moist and dense, with spiced flavor in every bite! I could happily enjoy this cake any time, whether as a breakfast treat with my coffee, a holiday dessert, or an afternoon snack all year round! If you love the warm, spiced flavors in this bundt cake, you have to try my Cinnamon Roll Blondies , too! They’re another cinnamon-sugar treat with a soft, chewy texture and that irresistible cinnamon roll flavor.\nIngredients & Substitutions Room Temperature Ingredients: Before starting this recipe, make sure the ingredients are at room temperature. This is especially true for the cream cheese, butter, eggs, and buttermilk. Cream Cheese: The cream cheese in the cake gives the cake so much moisture. It is part of the reason this cake is so amazing! Butter: Butter is a key ingredient in bundt cakes, giving them a rich, buttery flavor and moist crumb. You will need 2 1/2 sticks of salted butter. If using unsalted butter, add a pinch of kosher salt (about 1/4 teaspoon) to the cake batter. Eggs: Six large eggs bind the ingredients and give the cake structure. Cake Flour: This recipe requires cake flour. (Using all-purpose flour will yield different results.) You can make ‘homemade’ cake flour in a pinch if you don’t have cake flour . Buttermilk : Buttermilk adds moisture and a little tangy flavor to the cake, making it taste better. It also helps the cake rise and gives it a softer, lighter texture. If you don’t have any on hand, make homemade buttermilk. I have four ways to make buttermilk–use the sour cream version for this bundt cake recipe. Filling: The ‘cinnamon swirl’ comes from the cinnamon sugar mixture that is in the middle of the cake. Glaze: The simple sweet glaze is made with confectioners’ sugar (powdered sugar) and whole milk. Drizzle it over the cooled cake. How To Tell When A Bundt Cake Is Done Baking To tell when the Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is done baking, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. (Start checking around the 60-minute mark.) If it comes out with a few moist crumbs but no wet batter, the cake is ready. The edges of the cake should also be golden brown, and the top should spring back when gently pressed. If you’re unsure, you can bake it for a few more minutes, but be sure to check regularly to avoid overbaking.\nCan I Use A Different Pan For My Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake? Yes, If you don’t have a Bundt pan, you can use two loaf pans, a 9×13-inch baking dish, or a tube pan. Just remember, the baking time may change, so start checking the cake with a toothpick around 45-50 minutes. Once the toothpick comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the cake (or loaves) is done!\nHow To Store Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake Once the cake has set and is completely cooled, store it in an airtight container at room temperature. You can also wrap the cake in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, but be careful not to disturb the glaze. It will last up to 2 days. For longer storage, freeze the cake.\nHow To Freeze Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake If you can, freeze the cinnamon swirl bundt cake without the glaze. (You can add the glaze when you’re ready to serve.) After the cake has cooled completely, wrap it in plastic wrap. Then wrap it in aluminum foil for extra protection. The cake will stay good in the freezer for 2-3 months. When you’re ready to eat it, take the cake out of the freezer and let it thaw in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight. Thawing in the fridge helps keep the cake’s texture and flavor. Once it’s thawed, add the glaze. Make sure the cake is at room temperature or a little chilled before adding the glaze.\nCinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake Prep Time 15 minutes mins Cook Time 1 hour hr 15 minutes mins Total Time 1 hour hr 30 minutes mins This Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Cake is my classic and–dare I say–perfect cream cheese pound cake with a cinnamon-sugar layer in the center and a sweet glaze drizzled on top.

Print Rate Comment Ingredients ▢ 1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, room temperature ▢ 1 ¼ cups (2 ½ sticks / 284 g) salted butter, room temperature ▢ 3 cups (600 g) granulated sugar ▢ 6 large eggs, room temperature ▢ 2 teaspoons vanilla extract ▢ 3 cups (375 g) cake flour ▢ ¼ cup (60 g) buttermilk, room temperature Filling ▢ ¼ cup (50 g) light brown sugar, packed ▢ 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon Topping ▢ 1 cup (120 g) confectioners' sugar ▢ 2-3 tablespoons whole milk Instructions Preheat oven to 325°F. Spray a 10-inch bundt pan with non-stick spray. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese and butter, mixing on medium speed until smooth, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the granulated sugar. Continue mixing until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then add the vanilla extract. With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the cake flour, mixing until just combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer and pour in the buttermilk. Use a rubber spatula to fold the buttermilk into the batter gently, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate all ingredients. Pour half of the batter into the prepared bundt pan, spreading it evenly. In a small bowl, combine the light brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the batter in the pan. Carefully pour the remaining batter over the cinnamon mixture, spreading it to cover as much of the cinnamon layer as possible. Bake for 75-80 minutes, checking for doneness at 1 hour. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs but no wet batter. The crust should be a dark golden brown around the edges and lighter in the center. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature in the pan, then invert it onto a serving plate. Topping In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, whole milk, and vanilla extract until smooth and pourable. Adjust the milk if needed to reach a drizzle consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake, allowing it to run down the sides.
