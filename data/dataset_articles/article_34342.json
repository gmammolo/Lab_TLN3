  "text": "Litzy: Having Fun and Staying Active Litzy loves all the activities she can take part in while she is at Shriners Children's Texas. Her family was renting a room inside a paper factory in Hidalgo, Mexico. Litzy walked outside into the factory courtyard just as the storm passed, heading in the direction of her school nearby, when she suddenly became entangled in a live electrical wire. The [electrical burn](/en/Pediatric-Care/Electrical-Burns) from the accident left her hospitalized for much of the past year, and her injuries resulted in the loss of her right arm. For months now, Litzy has been a patient at [Shriners Children’s Texas](/en/Locations/Texas), where she is receiving treatment for her [burn injuries](/en/Pediatric-Care/Burn-Care), and undergoing [physical therapy](/en/Pediatric-Care/Physical-Therapy). Though her injuries have been life-altering, Litzy’s spirit remains unbroken. Despite being right-handed, she has adapted to using her left hand to continue expressing her artistic talents. She has a natural gift for drawing and painting, and even after the accident, she continues to pursue her passion for art. Litzy’s intelligence, creativity and great sense of humor shine through, helping her cope with the daily challenges of recovery. According to the hospital schoolteacher, Flor, one of the notable things about Litzy is her perfectionism, especially when it comes to her art. Her attention to detail and drive to get things \"just right\" speak volumes about her focus and determination. Litzy has refused to let the loss of her arm hinder her creative expression, demonstrating an incredible ability to adapt. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming at Shriners Children’s. I am happy about the care I have received while I’ve been here. This environment of care and encouragement has helped Litzy remain optimistic and focused on her recovery. The team at Shriners Children's is working closely with her to build her physical strength, provide emotional support and empower her to continue creating art, even with the use of her non-dominant hand. Litzy is very well-rounded, and her interests go beyond art and reading. She is physically active and has taken lessons in karate. She likes jumping rope and her favorite class in school is PE. As for her stay in Texas, she said she likes Tex Mex food, but she doesn’t care for standard American fare like hamburgers or pizza. She also likes Tim Burton movies and a variety of music artists such as Michael Jackson, Queen and ABBA. Lizzy’s story is a testament to her strength and resilience. While the road ahead may still hold challenges, her determination and talent will undoubtedly continue to lead her forward. Through art, humor and the support of her caregivers, Lizzy is not just recovering – she’s thriving.",
