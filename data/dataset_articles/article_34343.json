  "text": "Community Montessori School at 4102 St. Joseph Road, New Albany, operates the Community Montessori Food Pantry near the CM Community Nurtury — this is the house at the top of the hill from the main school campus. The pantry is in the small shed with a banner “CM Community Food Pantry.”\nAccessing the pantry is free, and open to the public Monday— Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nNo applications are required, take what you need, and leave what you can.\nDonations can be dropped off at the pantry Monday — Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. or at the entrance of the school at 4102 Saint Joseph Road Monday — Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nCommunity Montessori would like to extend its deepest gratitude to all the families and community members who support the Food Pantry program. This essential resource would not be possible without the generosity and dedication of the community. In particular, the school would like to recognize the Becht Family and their neighbor for their recent, generous donation, which provided an invaluable boost to the pantry.\nMonetary donations can be made at CM Food Pantry. Or, supporters can stop by the Pantry to drop off items, or place an order online from the Wishlist.",
