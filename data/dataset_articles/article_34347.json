  "text": "DENGUE cases in the country are declining, according to the Department of Health (DOH) which said that from September 29 to October 12, only 21,097 dengue cases were reported nationwide, or equivalent to an 8 percent decline from the 23,032 dengue cases reported from September 15 to 28.\n“Cases are declining overall,” said the DOH.\nIt said nearly all regions did not register an increase in dengue cases within the period.\nOnly the NCR (to 3,002 from 2,765 cases), Central Luzon (to 2,351 from 2,219), and Calabarzon (to 3,513 from 2,907) saw dengue cases climb during the period.\nDespite this, Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said there is no reason for the public to become complacent against the mosquito-borne disease “because the rains will continue during this season.”\nHe asked the public to practice precautionary measures against dengue like ensuring that mosquito breeding grounds are destroyed, consistently using mosquito repellants, and seeking early consultation when experiencing symptoms.\nIt is also important that local governments prioritize prevention and testing initiatives against dengue.",
