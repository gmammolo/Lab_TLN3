  "text": "The Conversation: A panel discussion on how to manage stress as a parent Today on The Conversation, our panel of guests discusses the high levels of stress reported among American parents. The U.S. Surgeon General recently issued an [advisory](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/08/28/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-mental-health-well-being-parents.html) stating that parents and caregivers are experiencing higher rates of stress than their non-parent peers, and it could be taking a toll on their health and well-being. We ask our panelists, how can parents lower stress when the expectations around child-rearing seem higher than ever? Our guests today are: - Britt Young, a therapist with [Xplor Counseling](https://www.xplorcounseling.com/) - David Sun-Miyashiro, executive director of [HawaiiKidsCAN](https://hawaiikidscan.org/) - Marissa Ku’uipo Baptista, board member of the [Hawaiʻi State Parent Teacher Association](https://www.hawaiistateptsa.org/)",
