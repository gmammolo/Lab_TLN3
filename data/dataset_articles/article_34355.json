  "text": "Moderna delivered better-than-expected profit and sales in the third quarter after an early start to sales of this season’s COVID boosters.\nThe company’s latest COVID shot was approved three weeks earlier than last year, according to a statement Thursday, helping drive product sales up 3.6 percent. Moderna still foresees 2024 product sales of $3 billion to $3.5 billion.\nIt’s unclear whether Moderna will sell as many COVID vaccines as it did last year, but it looks like a “durable and sizable market,” Moderna CFO Jamey Mock said in an interview. “It proves that there’s certainly a patient population that wants to be protected against COVID.”\nInvestors have been spooked since the pandemic by fading sales of COVID vaccines and a slow rollout for Moderna’s only other product, an RSV vaccine. The RSV shot was cleared in May, after customers had ordered rival products, and had just $10 million in sales in the quarter.\nModerna’s shares fell more than 3 percent. The stock has fallen 48 percent this year through Wednesday’s close. It plunged in September after the company forecast 2025 sales below analysts’ expectations and pushed back its target to break even by two years to 2028.\nAdvertisement",
