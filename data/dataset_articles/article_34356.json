  "text": "RAPID CITY, S.D. – One Heart Inc. is an organization focused on programs for those struggling with addiction, homelessness, and domestic abuse. One of their programs, The Towers at One Heart, provides transitional housing for those in need. However, The Towers are currently at capacity. We spoke with Charity Doyle, the CEO of One Heart, to get insight into the challenges The Towers are faced with. “We don't want to add trauma to people when they're already in a very difficult place in life by splitting people up,” said Doyle, “We worked really hard to make sure we found a property that could accommodate those needs and keep families together. Expanding it would be really, really difficult right now. We are, however, always keeping our eye on properties that come up for sale to keep the campus contiguous.” One Heart is currently focused on sustaining the services they already provide at The Towers such as 24-hour security, ensuring a safe environment for residents. While approximately 80% of the residents at The Towers suffer from substance abuse, upon leaving One Heart for bigger and better things, the rate of relapse is less than 30%. This is achieved in part to various programs adjacent to The Towers such as The Atrium, a program for supporting longevity and sobriety who those who have been freed from substance abuse issues. The Towers also provide services to students of the nearby South Dakota Mines. For Charity Doyle, a large part in developing the programs at One Heart involved her personal experience with homelessness while attending South Dakota Mines. She extends from her personal experience by providing housing for students in similar situations. To show support for The Towers and One Heart’s mission, head to oneheartrc.org",
