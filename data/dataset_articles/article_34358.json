  "text": "On National Food Fortification Day, Nestlé Philippines highlighted the urgent need to combat malnutrition, particularly micronutrient deficiencies (MND) in young children.\nIn the Philippines, micronutrient deficiencies are a common form of malnutrition affecting young children. Iron deficiency anemia, for example, affects 43.1 percent of children aged six months to under one year, leading to symptoms with potential long-term impacts on cognitive and motor development. Other prevalent issues include iodine and vitamin A deficiencies. Local studies also point to additional deficiencies in vitamins B and C and minerals like calcium and zinc.\nThe Food and Nutrition Research Institute supports food fortification as a cost-effective, long-term solution to combat MND.\nFor children aged six months to two years, fortified foods like infant cereals offer a practical source of essential nutrients during crucial growth stages.\nArlene Tan-Bantoto, Nestlé PH’s nutrition business executive officer, emphasized the role of Cerelac in addressing MND. “Children in the weaning stage need specific nutrients for healthy growth, and MND can have serious long-term effects,” she said. “Our infant cereals are fortified with up to 20 vitamins and minerals, probiotics, and DHA, essential for child development.”\nBalancing taste and nutrition, Nestlé’s fortified cereals are designed to be appealing to young children, with minimal added sugars that remain within international and local guidelines. The company is also expanding no-added-sugar options to give parents healthier choices.\n“Our commitment to nutrition, based on global research and local standards, continues to support Filipino parents in raising healthy children. We prioritize good nutrition and health to help ensure a strong foundation for future generations,” Tan-Bantoto concluded.",
