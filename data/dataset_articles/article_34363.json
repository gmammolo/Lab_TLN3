  "text": "This Is Carolina: How social media is empowering one company to deliver life-saving kits to Helene survivors MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - When devastation strikes, social media is a place to find a digital lifeline that often can turn into a tangible one. “We are working on this grassroots effort to get emergency supplies and medical supplies to the people that need it,” said Alyssa Wright. For the people of Western North Carolina and parts of Tennessee, that lifeline is Johnson City native Alyssa Wright and her friends at [6:8 Medical Solutions](https://68medical.com/) in Myrtle Beach. “My friend Melissa from back home is a nurse. She posted that there‘s a town called Burnsville in North Carolina that they are hiking up to every single day. They need medical supplies. Can someone help,” she said. “In seeing that post, I knew, ’ Oh I know some guys who have medical supplies. Let me see if they might be able to help.‘” Wright called [6:8 Medical Solutions](https://68medical.com/) and within hours got the ball rolling. “We had a plane donated, we had pilots, and we had more than $10,000 worth of medical equipment from 6:8 being flown directly into Johnson City,” said Wright. The veteran-owned company provides emergency medical equipment and supplies to first responders but quickly shifted gears to building easy-to-use life-saving kits for the boots on the ground in areas needing it the most. “They have responders and volunteers willing to help but they don’t have the medical equipment,” said Uriah Popp. Popp founded [6:8 Medical Solutions](https://68medical.com/) after serving 23 years in the Army as a special operations medic and special missions unit medic. He now uses his life experience and expertise in creating devices to simplify emergency medicine. “That’s one of the tenants of our organization, enabling the layperson to mitigate and intervene and save life. So, we develop intuitive, small, affordable devices that can be employed by everybody,” said Popp. Popp showed us the military and professional grade kits and belt kits his team made to help with everything from burns to hypothermia. They are making countless trips to hand deliver the life-saving equipment all thanks to generous donations from our community and have raised almost $100,000. “I want people to know that people do care,” said Popp. And they are just getting started. “It’s a real blessing that I have the platform to be able to share those stories so we can bring light to it and hopefully save lives and make a difference to those people,” said Wright. “We just need that support to continue so that we can continue making an impact.” 6:8 Medical Solutions needs money to supply more hypothermia kits and respirator masks.
