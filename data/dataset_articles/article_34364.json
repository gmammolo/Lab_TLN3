  "text": "The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has successfully performed a historic fetal surgery to remove a heart tumor, saving the life of a baby from Tennessee.\nWhen Brailey Valenzuela was 24 weeks pregnant, an ultrasound showed her baby had a deadly heart tumor.\n\"A pericardial teratoma is a mass or tumor that develops inside of the sac that surrounds the heart,\" said Dr. Holly Hedrick from CHOP.\nThe only hope was surgery on the fetus that CHOP is renowned for doing.\n\"During the operation, we expose the uterus,\" Hedrick said. \"And then we expose the baby's chest. And we do that by actually leaving most of the baby inside and just the arms come out.\"\nThe surgical team then operates on the fetus, carefully removing the tumor from the heart.\nEverything is stitched back together and the pregnancy continues. Three months later on Feb. 17, Arley was born via C-section.\n\"The first moment I saw her, I remember joy, relief,\" Brailey Valenzuela said.\n\"It was amazing. It was — it's like the light at the end of the tunnel,\" Louis Valenzuela said. \"We're very thankful that medicine has advanced enough that they can do open heart surgery on a fetus.\"\nAfter a few weeks recovering at CHOP, Arley and her mom were able to go home.\nAnd as far as her growing and developing, they don't expect there to be any issues. Her heart is functioning normally.\nBrailey Valenzuela became the fourth patient at CHOP to successfully undergo this type of fetal heart surgery.\nMore from CBS News Brandon Graham on season-ending injury: \"I'm hurt about it.\" Man convicted of threatening elderly man with gun over parking space Man dies after shot in the chest in Kingsessing, police say Man arrested after minor crash leads to fatal shooting in pizza shop Arizona runner figured he'd try his 1st half marathon – then he won In: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Fetus Tennessee Stephanie Stahl Stephanie Stahl is an Emmy Award-winning health reporter.
