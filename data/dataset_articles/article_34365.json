With winter breathing down our necks like an overenthusiastic dog wanting a game of fetch, the Secretary of Health , Nadine Gasman Zylbermann, is making a clarion call that echoes across the chilly air: “Get vaccinated!” Yes, folks, it’s that time of year again, where rolling up your sleeve takes on new meaning—especially if you’re over 60 or have a tiny human attached to your leg.\nWhy You Shouldn’t Ignore the Jab—Or Risk Getting Jabbed at the Checkout Queue! Our beloved Nadine is all about spreading the love—or should we say, the vaccines? “Covid is with very low numbers,” she says, which frankly sounds like something a parent would say when trying to justify why your teenage sibling got a B-. Nevertheless, she continues on a more hopeful note, “We hope to keep the numbers down like last year, because who doesn’t love a good duet of influenza and Covid-19?”\nYet, my dear readers, if you find yourself in the high-risk club—adults over 60, kids between 6 months and five years, and yes, even pregnant folks—now’s your time to shine! Get yourself over to the health services and roll that sleeve up like you’re preparing for a friendly wrestling match. Just think of it as an arm wrestling contest with a needle, but this time, you want to win!\nVaccination Campaign: Almost as Popular as a Pizza at a Kids’ Party! During a recent free breast reconstruction event—because nothing says winter prep quite like making sure everyone’s feeling fabulous—officials reported a whopping 600,000 vaccinations already given. That’s more than the number of pine trees planted in December, I dare say!\nBut hold your horses, because the fun doesn’t stick around forever! The campaign’s got an expiry date — like that old milk at the back of your fridge — running all the way until the end of February next year. So, make like a squirrel storing nuts for the winter and get your vaccine before the frost bites!\nAll Aboard the Vaccine Express! And what’s that? Good acceptance rates for both vaccines? According to Nadine, people are eagerly embracing the chance to get jabbed. Maybe it’s the thrill of the needle, or perhaps folks are just really running from those winter ailments like a kid from a scary clown at a birthday bash?\nIn many ways, getting the flu and Covid-19 vaccines feels like a rite of passage—like graduating from school or realizing that your body can no longer endure three-hour long Netflix binges without consequences. So, don’t be shy; show up, get vaccinated, and give that flu the old heave-ho!\nSo remember, my good citizens, winter’s coming, and with it comes the risk of not just snow and ice, but also nasty viruses lurking around. Do yourself and all of us a favor—stay healthy, and let’s show those diseases who’s boss this winter!\nAs winter approaches, the Secretary of Health of the capital, Nadine Gasman Zylbermann , strongly urged residents to get vaccinated against serious illnesses, including influenza and Covid-19. This recommendation is particularly crucial for individuals within vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\n“Currently, Covid-19 case numbers are relatively low, but we expect a resurgence of both influenza and Covid-19 this winter, similar to what we experienced last year,” he stated. Gasman Zylbermann emphasized the importance of vaccination for high-risk groups, which include adults over 60, children aged between six months and five years, pregnant women, and individuals with existing health issues. He urged these populations to seek vaccination services as a proactive measure.\nDuring a complimentary breast reconstruction event at Rubén Leñero Hospital, the Secretary noted that the ongoing vaccination campaign in the capital has successfully administered vaccines to approximately 600,000 individuals so far.\nHe reminded everyone that the vaccination campaign will conclude at the end of February next year, highlighting the urgency for residents to receive their shots before the onset of the cold season to bolster their immunity against viruses.\nGasman Zylbermann pointed out that there has been a positive response from the community regarding the vaccination drive, as many have been actively coming forward to receive both the Covid-19 and influenza vaccines, underscoring a collective effort to safeguard public health.\n**Interview with Nadine Gasman Zylbermann, Secretary of Health**\n**Interviewer:** Welcome, Nadine! Exciting news about the winter vaccination campaign! Can you tell us why it’s so⁤ important for people—especially high-risk groups—to get vaccinated this season?\n**Nadine Gasman ⁢Zylbermann:** Absolutely! As winter approaches, the risk ​of influenza and COVID-19 infections increases. We’re ‍particularly concerned about those over 60, young children, and pregnant individuals. ‌Vaccination not only protects the person getting the shot but also helps reduce the spread of these viruses in our communities. We want to keep those numbers‍ down, just like we did last year, and vaccinating is our⁢ best shot at achieving ⁣that!\n**Interviewer:** On that note,‌ you mentioned that you hope to keep ⁣the infection rates low. How have people been‍ responding to the campaign so far?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:** The response has been quite positive! We’ve seen​ a strong uptake⁢ of vaccinations—over 600,000 doses already administered! It’s heartening to see people stepping up and taking proactive measures for their health. It ​almost feels​ like community spirit is in the air as ​we all⁢ work together to defeat ‌these bugs!\n**Interviewer:** That’s ‍great to hear! But ‌with an ⁣expiry date on the ​campaign‍ until the ‍end⁤ of February, what do ⁤you say to those​ who might be reluctant to get vaccinated?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:** I would ​say—don’t wait! Think of it as an‍ important winter checklist. Just like you wouldn’t leave your snow tires on until after the first storm, you shouldn’t put off your vaccination.⁣ The sooner ⁣you get your shot, the sooner you’re⁣ protected. Remember, preventing illness means fewer hospital‍ visits and less strain on our health services.\n**Interviewer:**⁣ Excellent ⁢point! It sounds like there’s⁣ a sense of urgency in getting these vaccinations done. So, what ⁣final message do you have ​for our listeners?\n**Nadine Gasman Zylbermann:**⁤ Winter’s coming, and it can bring ⁣with it more than just cold weather. By getting vaccinated,‍ you’re not just doing yourself a favor, but also looking out⁢ for your family and community. Let’s ‌tackle⁣ this winter together, stay healthy, and make sure we’re ready for whatever comes our way!\n**Interviewer:** ⁢Thank ⁣you,‍ Nadine! Wise words indeed. Remember, everyone, roll up those ⁤sleeves and make ‌it a healthy winter!",
