  "text": "Pet foods with ethical ingredients offer a better and safer choice for animals, people, and the planet.\nIn recent years, pet parents have been looking more closely at the ingredients in dog and cat food, and the importance of choosing ethically sourced ingredients is becoming clearer. Ethical food ingredients are produced, sourced, and processed with environmental sustainability, animal welfare, fair labor practices, and social responsibility in mind. Here are six reasons to choose pet foods made with responsibly sourced ingredients.\n1. Better for the planet\nPet food producers who prioritize ethical ingredients work with farmers who take steps to minimize the environmental impact of food production. These steps can include using sustainable farming methods, decreasing waste, reducing carbon emissions, and supporting local producers.\n2. Improved animal welfare\nThe human treatment of animals is an important philosophy in ethical ingredient sourcing. This includes practices and standards that ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the animals, such as:\n- Providing proper living conditions\n- Giving access to food and water\n- Minimizing stress and suffering\n- Providing healthcare\n- Using gentle handling techniques\n- Ensuring the animals can express natural behaviors.\n3. Food safety\nMany pet food companies that embrace ethical ingredients also have stricter internal quality control practices that protect the safety of dogs and cats.\n4. Complete transparency\nSimilarly, pet food companies that strive to responsibly source ingredients often have transparency policies regarding their sourcing and production methods, labor practices, social and environmental performance, accountability, and more.\n5. Better for people\nThe way these ingredients are harvested benefit workers by prioritizing fair labor practices and supporting local communities.\n6. Superior nutrition\nDog and cat food companies that care about ethical ingredients formulate their foods for complete and balanced nutrition. This can include:\n- Selecting the highest quality ingredients\n- Avoiding fillers and artificial binders\n- Choosing fresh food and minimally processing it\n- Selecting biologically appropriate ingredients.\nWhy ZIWI?\n[ZIWI’s](https://us.ziwipets.com) dedication to ethical ingredients has been at the heart of their company since the beginning.
