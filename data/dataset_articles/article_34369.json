  "text": "‘In clinical medical practice, AI would be a masterful aid, which could expedite diagnosis and rapidly suggest treatments…’\nONE of the greatest human innovations introduced in recent times is Artificial Intelligence, crude forms of which have actually been around for centuries. The recent field of AI research started in 1956 at the Darthmouth Summer Research Project. Still a controversial matter, AI, a double-edge sword, could cut both ways. The vast benefits artificial intelligence could provide the world are immense, but it also poses a lot of danger, especially in the hands of bad actors. Some of them are job displacement, economic inequality, security concerns, loss of human connection, data collection, misinformation, bias, improper disclosure of personal data, lack of accessibility, unforeseen and unintended consequences, abuse and misuse, and existential risk, wrong or unsafe decisions and outcomes from AI machines, which fears Elon Musk of Space X and Tesla has expressed.\nOne recent example is California’s passage of a bill (SB 1120) last month “ensuring that physicians, not artificial intelligence (AI) have the final say on patients’ treatment and services, including insurance-required prior authorization.’” Review of a significant number of AI decisions on this matter revealed that AI decisions had been erroneous, leading to delay and denial of diagnoses and treatments among some seniors, contributing to some deaths.\nArtificial intelligence for our homes, garages, offices, cars, personal gadgets (computers, tablets, phones etc.), and security devices are magnificent and beneficial, even addictive. We are so dependent on them and are blessed to have them today. But their misuse and abuse are already evident, especially in social media and in the hands of criminals.\nIn clinical medical practice, AI would be a masterful aid, which could expedite diagnosis and rapidly suggest treatments, but this mechanical-electrical, algorithmic-controlled cold “humanoid” will never have human warmth, empathy, and spirit.\nWhile AI is excellent in countless ways, human intelligence and human touch are still superior because of our five basic senses and instincts coupled with our inherent ability to love, feel compassion, and desire for justice.\nSo, we, humans, can either create and utilize AI to be a monster to hurt people or society for selfish or diabolical reasons, or even destroy mankind, or develop it wisely to make the whole world a better place, a more convenient, healthier, more productive, more secure, and happier habitat for all of us, earthlings. Let’s see how intelligent and wise, or stupid we, humans, really are.\nLectins, gluten Studies have shown that lectins (in legumes and grains) and glutens (in wheat products, like bread) are unhealthy substances also found in food items like oatmeal, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, paprika, peppers, spinach, kale, some fruits, etc., items we used to think were healthy for us.\nLectins and glutens are proteins that could disrupt digestion by binding to, and destroying, the lining of our intestines, causing leaky gut syndrome, allowing bacteria to seep into our bloodstream. They could cause inflammation and obesity and could also damage our immune system. Soaking (in acid medium, like lemon juice, buttermilk, yogurt) and cooking at high temperature will reduce lectins and glutens. Make sure to read food labels (or Google food ingredients) to make sure you are eating healthy. While quantity (caloric control) is important, quality of foods we eat is also vital.\nAluminum dangers Aluminum has been a part of our life since 1903 when it was first introduced in France. In 1911, this material was used in Bern, Switzerland, for wrapping chocolate bars. In 1926, the US Foil Company (parent company of Reynolds Metals) launched this tin foil, which became an instant hit.\nAnyway, studies have now revealed that aluminum has detrimental health effects as a neurotoxin, linked to Alzheimer’s, bone disease, and pulmonary fibrosis, among other still undiscovered side effects.\nHot food items wrapped in tin foil could conceivably contaminate the food. Using aluminum cookware and aluminum accessories in the kitchen is also unsafe. Aluminum could leach into foods.\nSafer alternatives include using stainless steel, glass, and ceramic cook wares, utensils, and dinner wares.\nVitamin D3 warning One of the most popular and beneficial vitamins today is D3, a nutrient our body needs for building and maintaining healthy bones, to prevent osteoporosis, for one. It also regulates many cellular functions in us and has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective qualities that support our brain cell activity, immune health, and muscle function.\nVitamin D is not found naturally in many food items but present in fortified milk, cereal, and fatty fishes, like salmon, sardines, mackerel. Exposure to sunlight also converts a chemical in our skin into an active form of calciferol (Vitamin D). During winter months, with less sunlight, vitamin D production might be less or nil. Sunscreen, obviously, while important to prevent skin cancer, also decreases vitamin D production.\nThe latest from the FDA and medical centers, like the Mayo Clinic, Harvard, based on updated guidelines from multiple studies from the Endocrine Society, reported in August 2024 in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and metabolism is that the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 international units (IU) for children up to age 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70 years, and 800 IU for people over 70 years.\nWhile taking vitamin D3 is generally safe, some side effects of overdosing can include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite and unwanted weight loss, weaknesses, confusion, disorientation, heart rhythm disturbances, kidney stones and renal damage. Vitamin D could interact with many medications.\nBefore embarking on any health strategy, including adding vitamins or supplements to your current regimen, discuss your plans with your physician because any of these might interact with your medications or cause potential serious complications.",
