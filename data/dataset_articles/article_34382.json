  "text": "On Sunday, October 20, Spelman ’s Wellness Center proudly hosted an exhibition event marking the launch of the inaugural Jaguars Swim Club. As a vital component of Spelman’s comprehensive aquatics program, this club proudly holds the distinction of being the first-ever all-women’s swimming club established at a historically Black college or university ( HBCU ). This groundbreaking initiative is spearheaded by the newly appointed Adrienne Wesley, who serves as Spelman’s Aquatics Director and is also the head coach of the club.\nThe exciting exhibition featured 14 club members, comprising both dedicated students and staff members, who showcased their skills by competing in a variety of individual and relay events. Participants engaged in individual medley, butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle events, spanning distances between 25 to 100 yards. Additionally, they participated in competitive 4 x 50 yards relay events, further displaying their versatility and teamwork.\nSamiyah Young, C’2025, a biology major hailing from Chicago, leads the club team’s executive board with enthusiasm as its president. Drawing from her extensive experience as a former competitive swimmer, she brings a wealth of knowledge, skills, and leadership to the team, inspiring her peers.\n“Leading this team means not only fostering community but also creating a space where Black women can thrive in a sport that often lacks representation,” said Young during the event. “Swimming at Spelman is a powerful way to challenge norms, break barriers, and represent in and out of the water.”\nIn addition to providing valuable opportunities to compete, the club is committed to enhancing participants’ swimming abilities, promoting fitness, and actively working to discredit the stereotypes and disparities that persist within the Black community regarding swimming.\n“The Spelman Jaguars Swim Team is not just about competition,” emphasized Coach Wesley. “It represents empowerment and community for Black women. Swimming fosters confidence, resilience, and camaraderie among our students, providing them with valuable life skills both in and out of the pool.”\nThe club team is aspiring to compete in College Club Swimming under the umbrella of the U.S. Masters Swimming organization, which aims to increase participation in swimming at HBCUs across the country, thereby enriching the athletic landscape for future generations.\nAmari Ann, C’2027, an enthusiastic member of the Jaguars Swim Club, has dedicated over 13 years to swimming, including five years spent competing. “I love being a part of the Swim Club at Spelman… I took a break from the competitive realm in high school, so I hadn’t swum competitively in 4 years,” expressed Ann, a political science major from New Orleans. “…It’s such a family-oriented thing. I’m going to move into coaching sooner or later, so I’m interested in that to sharpen my skills.”\nFor those interested in joining or learning more about the club, please reach out to Adrienne Wesley in the Wellness Center at adriennewesley@spelman.edu or follow SpelmanAquatics1881 on Instagram for updates and information.\n**Interview with Samiyah⁣ Young, President of the ⁤Jaguars Swim Club at Spelman College**\n**Editor:** Thank you for taking the time to speak‌ with us, ⁣Samiyah!
