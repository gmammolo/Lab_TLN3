  "text": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) — After being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a rare autoimmune condition, young mother Shauna Helton, has turned her personal health journey into a mission to help others. \"I was struggling to get out of bed. I was struggling to function,\" Helton said, describing her challenges after the birth of her daughter. EDS is a collection of connective tissue disorders that can cause symptoms ranging from joint pain and fatigue to gastrointestinal issues, headaches, and anxiety. Helton, a registered nurse, found relief in her own kitchen by cooking and eating healthy foods. She now shares her \"Smarty Plants\" recipes online, which are dairy-free, gluten-free, and minimally processed. \"I try to stick with all the nutritional type of foods that our body needs to prevent inflammation,\" she said. Helton demonstrated how to make loaded turkey spaghetti squash with roasted veggie sauce on the What's Happening in Health show (6-7 a.m. Sundays). \"So basically with your spaghetti squash, you can kind of pull away... you'll see it look like noodles,\" she explained. The dish is topped with ground turkey, mushrooms, and roasted vegetables. Helton shares her recipes not only because they have helped her but also because there is evidence that a plant-based diet can benefit other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus and multiple sclerosis . Her recipes, focused on wellness, are available online for free.",
