  "text": "ADA, Okla. – The National Recycling Week, November 11-15, East Central University (ECU) and the Oka Institute invite the Ada community to participate in a growing initiative to recycle glass. Thanks to a $20,000 grant awarded by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) as part of its solid waste disposal program, this project has already diverted over 4,000 pounds of glass from local landfills.\nDr. Christine Pappas, Policy and Education Coordinator for the Oka Institute and grant author, shared the program’s bold vision: “Our ultimate goal is to recycle every single consumer glass bottle in Ada.” Community members are encouraged to bring their glass bottles to one of four black poly carts located behind ECU’s Education building, accessible via Stadium Drive. Glass recycling drop-offs are accepted at any time.\nThe Oka Institute also invites local businesses to participate by setting aside glass bottles for collection. “Businesses may actually save money by not needing as many dumpsters or trash cans if they set glass aside for us to pick up,” Pappas noted. The team is ready to work with businesses to arrange convenient pickups.\nThe project is managed by Mason Martinez, a Water Resource Policy and Management Master of Science student from Oklahoma City, with support from team members Suraj Khatri, a nursing major from Nepal, and Nischal Chaudhary, a computer science major also from Nepal.\nOriginally funded by a Rotary District Grant from the Ada Sunrise Rotary Club, the glass recycling project has evolved significantly. Grant funds enabled ECU to purchase a glass grinder that supports innovative research and sustainable applications for crushed glass. The Oka Institute has funded summer research projects exploring various uses for recycled glass, such as creating concrete pavers, landscaping fill, and even art materials.\nFor more details on how you can join ECU and the Oka Institute’s glass recycling efforts, or to arrange glass pickup for your business, please contact Christine Pappas at 580-559-5640.\nCutline: Left to right: Suraj Khatri, Mason Martinez, and Nischal Chaudhary.\n-ECU-",
