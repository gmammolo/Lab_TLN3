I’ve learned my lesson, and now I steam the butternut squash in the microwave and add them to the blender with the oats, and they’re epic. I’ll show you all my tricks below.\nIngredients\nThe ingredients for these butternut squash pancakes are listed with the amounts in the recipe card, but before you make any swaps and they flop here are some of my notes on them:\n- Milk: dairy or dairy-free milk will work. If using\noat milk for pancakes, add a tablespoon or two extra since it’s thicker. - Eggs: they’ll bind the ingredients and help the pancakes hold together. Using an egg replacer will often yield moist pancakes that can feel undercooked.\n- Butternut squash: you’ll need 1 cup of pureed squash, which is about 16 ounces of cooked and steamed cubes.\n- Oats: I recommend using old-fashioned rolled oats for this recipe. If you use quick-cooking oats, add an additional 2 tablespoons to thicken up the batter.\n- Baking powder: these react with heat and give pancakes their fluffy texture, a necessity for this recipe.\n- Salt: to enhance the other flavors.\n- Brown sugar: just a little adds a touch of sweetness that pairs great with the squash flavors.\n- Cinnamon: an optional add-in you’ll love.\nUsing Baby Food Butternut Squash\nOne convenient way of making these pancakes is using butternut squash puree; however, the texture is much thinner than when blending cooked squash yourself, so you’ll need to add additional oats to the batter.\nCanned Butternut Squash Puree\nWhile difficult to find, it exists! Canned butternut squash puree has a similar texture to pumpkin puree, which you can also swap in this recipe for the same amount.\nHow to Make Butternut Squash Pancakes\nThese pancakes come together really fast with the help of the blender! Some tips in the steps that ensure you don’t get any undercooked middles, a common pancake issue with this recipe, include:\n- Make the butternut squash puree\nThe butternut squash needs to be cooked first before turning it into a smooth puree, which is easy to make in a blender orfood processor. Let it cool down slightly before making the batter. - Make the pancake batter\nThe blender combines the ingredients and blends the oats seamlessly to create a smooth batter. It will be thick but don’t worry. - Wait 5 minutes\nLetting the batter rest for 5 minutes allows for the oats to absorb the liquid in the batter before cooking, ensuring the pancakes cook through and don’t feel wet or under cooked. - Cook the pancakes\nYou want to start with a hot, non-stick surface. Once it’s hot, grease it well. I use a ¼ cup scoop to measure out the batter and then use the back (or a spoon) to spread the batter a little so the middles cook through. - Serve\nKeep the pancakes warmwhile you cook the rest and serve with your favoritepancake toppingsand syrup.\nWhat Does the Batter Look Like\nThe batter for these pancakes is thicker than traditional batter because of the oats which are added directly into the blender with the other ingredients. The blender breaks them apart and makes them part of the batter eliminating the need for oat flour.\nWhen to Flip Butternut Squash Pancakes\nThe first side should cook for about 2 minutes over medium to medium-high heat. When you see bubbles on the top and defined edges, it’s time to flip the pancakes. If your pancakes are burning, reduce the heat.\nMore Fall Pancake Recipes\nIf you’re into fall-inspired breakfasts, especially pancakes, you’re going to love my Pumpkin Spice Pancake recipe, these easy pecan pancakes, simple sweet potato pancakes, and this Banana Pumpkin Pancakes recipe.\nButternut Squash Pancakes with Oats\nIngredients\n- ½ cup butternut squash pureé\n- ¾ cup milk, any\n- 2 eggs\n- 2 cups old fashioned oats*\n- 1 tablespoon baking powder\n- 1 tablespoon brown sugar\n- ½ teaspoon cinnamon\n- ¼ teaspoon salt\nInstructions\nPrep\n- Make the puree with cooked butternut squash in a blender or food processor. Let it cool down to room temperature before making the batter.\nMake the pancake batter\n- Add the ingredients in the blender in the order listed, with the liquid ingredients at the bottom and the oats on top. Blend until the oat flakes are gone, and they’ve incorporated themselves into a thick, smooth batter.\n- Allow the batter to rest for 5 minutes before cooking the pancakes for the best texture.\nCook the pancakes\n- Heat a non-stick griddle or large pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, grease, spray, or melt butter on the hot surface. When using an electric griddle, heat it somewhere between 300 and 350F.\n- Immediately, pour ¼ cup of pancake batter onto the greased pan. Cook the pancakes for about 2 minutes, until the edges begin to look defined and bubbles form. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another minute on the other side. Don’t press them down with the spatula. Remove from the pan onto a plate and keep them warm while you cook the rest of the batter.\nServe\n- Stack them high and top them with a little butter, syrup, and your favorite pancake toppings.\nStore\n- Refrigerate unused batter in the blender covered for up to 2 days. Let it come to room temperature for 10 minutes before cooking. Refrigerate leftover pancakes for up to 3 days. Or, freeze for up to 3 months.\nNotes\nTo use quick-cooking oats, add an additional 2 tablespoons to thicken up the batter.\nThe texture of baby food butternut squash is much thinner than when blending cooked squash yourself, so you’ll need to add additional oats to the batter, about 2 tablespoons.",
