  "text": "LIVE: Pet Connection: Meet Vixen\nFARGO — For a kitty with such a sweet heart, it’s kind of ironic two-year-old Vixen was born two Christmases ago with a hole in hers — literally.\nVixen’s mother was about to give birth when she was rescued from a hoarding situation and brought into foster care.\nDebra Bartelt of Far North Felines says it was a difficult situation, but the benefit is that the kittens have been handled since their birth, so they’re very comfortable with people, including Vixen.\nVeterinarians initially didn’t think she’d make it past two, given her congenital heart defect.\nThey also didn’t think they could safely spay her because of it.\nHowever, they say that since then, the hole has closed on its own.\nThat means she doesn’t require any additional medications and has since been spayed.\nShe’s great with people and very affectionate, although she does not like car rides.\nShe can also be selective with cats, so slow introductions are a good idea.\nIf this little girl fills your heart with love, check out her profile, here:\nhttps://www.petfinder.com/cat/vixen-73339191/nd/fargo/far-north-feline-rescue-nd44/",
