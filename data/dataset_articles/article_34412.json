  "text": "By NCPA Staff ,\n27 minutes ago\nHughesville, Pa. — Beauty in the Making, 27 S. Main St., Hughesville, will host an exclusive Christmas event on Nov. 8 for the benefit of Dwell Orphan Care. Dwell supports foster, adoptive, and kinship families within the region.\nFrom 5 to 9 p.m., enjoy live holiday music, try some sweet treats from Kathy's Café, take a photo on the sleigh, see the new Beauty in the Making store expansion, and be the first to shop the store's Christmas collection. The shop will feature a new clothing section in collaboration with Charli Mae's Boutique, which guests may peruse during the event. The first 50 visitors through the door will receive the shop's new canvas bag for Christmas 2024.\nMost importantly, take advantage of this opportunity to make a difference in the lives of the area's most vulnerable children.\nAdmission charges will be collected in the form of a donation to Dwell. The suggested minimum donation amount is $10 per person, though higher amounts are more than welcome.\nAnother 10% of all store proceeds during the evening will be donated to Dwell.\nDrawings for Mark's Outfitters, Charlie Mae's, Shelia Barton Jewelry and Gifts, and Beauty in the Making gift cards as well as a large metal Merry Christmas sign will be held throughout the event.\nThe store will be closed during the daytime on Nov. 8 as staff members set up the event.",
