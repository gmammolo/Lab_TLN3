Prior to joining Fox Chase, Galluzzi was an Assistant Professor of cell biology in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. His lab there focused on dissecting the links between adaptive stress responses of cancer cells and the activation of immune responses that target tumors during exposure to immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. “We are enormously excited to welcome Dr. Galluzzi to the Fox Chase and Temple family and look forward to working with him to further strengthen an already robust research program,” said Edna “Eti” Cukierman, PhD, Co-Leader of the Cancer Signaling and Microenvironment Research Program and [Marvin & Concetta Greenberg Chair in Pancreatic Cancer Research](https://www.foxchase.org/news/2023-12-11-fox-chase-cancer-centers-edna-eti-cukierman-named-to-newly-created-marvin-concetta-greenberg-chair-in-pancreatic-cancer-research).
