  "text": "Barrington High graduates join forces to host lifesaving blood drive In a powerful testament to the strength of community, two Barrington High School students — Carter Bailey and Max Lewis — are joining forces to fight for a cause that saved their lives: blood donation. Although separated by 10 years, their shared experiences with life-threatening illnesses have brought them together for a mission that is now close to their hearts. The duo is working to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation. In 2014, Carter Bailey was a senior at Barrington High School and cocaptain of the lacrosse team. But everything changed when he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. “He was a senior in high school and missed his entire lacrosse season,” said Celeste Bailey, Carter’s mom. “His world was turned upside down as he faced the uncertainty of survival.” Throughout his treatment, Carter depended on numerous blood and platelet transfusions. “I have now been cancer free for over 10 years. Recognizing the growing need for blood and platelet donations as someone who has been on the receiving end, my family and I continue to organize a blood drive,” said Carter Bailey Max Lewis was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells. He was just 11 years old. Throughout his treatment, which included a lifesaving stem cell transplant, Max underwent at least 10 blood transfusions — critical to his survival. “We never knew where the blood came from, but it was always there when Max needed it,” said Lisa Lewis, Max’s mother. “The generosity of those anonymous donors saved his life, and that’s why we’re so passionate about this blood drive.” The Lewis family continues to host the annual blood drive as a way to give back to the community. “When Max was first diagnosed, so many friends, family, and neighbors asked, ‘How can we help?’ Now, we tell them, ‘You can help by donating blood. You can help other kids in the same way Max was helped. Be a repeat customer, because there’s always a need.” What started as a fight for survival has grown into a mission of giving back. Carter and Max’s united vision to help others serves as a powerful reminder of the constant need for blood donations and the priceless lives donations save. The Carter Strong & Max’s Mission Vitalant Blood Drive will take place from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 23, at Countryside Fire Station, 2222 N. Pepper Road, Lake Barrington. Walk-ins welcome.
