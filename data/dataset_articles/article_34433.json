  "text": "Himachal Pradesh, 07 November 2024: ACC, the cement and building material company of the diversified Adani Portfolio, is committed to community welfare through enhanced healthcare access for all. Along with the Adani Foundation, the Company has donated a portable X-ray machine to the District Tuberculosis (TB) Hospital in rural Bilaspur. This initiative aims to help detect TB early, a major health issue in the region.\nThe ‘Mini90’ X-ray machine is lightweight and easy to carry, making it perfect for use in remote and hilly areas. It helps doctors diagnose patients quickly by providing clear images, which is especially important for checking chest, spine, and head conditions.\nThis X-ray machine donation will allow for better screening, resulting in faster treatment for people who need it the most in rural areas, wherein such devices may not be easily accessible. TB remains a serious concern in Bilaspur, with 249 cases per 100,000 people. This X-ray machine will help identify more cases and ensure quicker treatment.\nACC and the Adani Foundation are committed to supporting community welfare by focusing on projects that improve health, education, and livelihoods across all locations.",
