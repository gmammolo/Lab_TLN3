(WVDN) — The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) announced today that 44 lakes and streams were stocked with trout during the weeks of Oct. 21 and Oct. 28 as part of the state’s third annual Monster Trout Contest.\nDuring these two weeks, the WVDNR stocked 35,000 pounds of trophy-size trout and 6,500 pounds of monster trout, 100 of which received a pink tag. Anglers who catch a tagged monster trout, submit a photo with the tag number online and meet eligibility requirements can win a prize. One winner will receive a weekend cabin stay at a West Virginia State Park, and four other winners will receive a Cabela’s prize package. In addition, one monster trout was tagged by West Virginia’s first youth Master Angler . Whoever catches it and meets eligibility requirements can win a free lifetime fishing license.\nTo be eligible to win, Monster Trout Contest entries must be submitted by Friday, November 22, 2024.
