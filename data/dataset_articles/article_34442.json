  "text": "It has been 101 years since Sir Frederick Banting became Canada’s first Nobel Laureate in Medicine in 1923.\nHe was the youngest recipient of the Nobel Prize in that category and is still the youngest person to receive the prize in that category.\nAlthough he only lived for 50 years, Banting had a long list of remarkable achievements. He was a medical doctor, a war hero, researcher, and was Knighted for his efforts.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Of course, his most famous achievement was being the co-discoverer of insulin. That discovery was one of the greatest medical discoveries of all time, and changed the world.\nInsulin has saved the live of millions of people around the world and continues to do so.\nDiabetes continues as a world wide public health issue. Youth-onset diabetes, Type 1, is not preventable. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or at least delayed.\nThe cases of youth-onset diabetes is rising globally. Initially invisible and progressive, cell damage can be in progress at the time of diagnosis. This type of diabetes can be accompanied by obesity, hypertension and mental disorders. Some ethnicities such as Indigenous peoples in Canada, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia; and African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans in the United States are at higher risk of type 2 although the reasons are not clear.\nIn Canada and may other countries, living with diabetes is a daily challenge, especially for youth.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Canada has among the largest number of health surveillance systems with a youth component; and Canada now has an evolving National Diabetes Strategy. Despite these resources, the number of Canadian youth living with diabetes of any type, their gender and location are unknown.\nThe estimated total diabetes cases in Canada for all ages is approximately 4 million.\nSir Frederick Banting died in a plane crash in February 1941, in Newfoundland. He was on his way to England to conduct operational tests on a flying suit developed by a colleague.\nBanting initially survived the crash, however, the location was remote and it took several days for rescuers to arrive. He died the day after the crash from injuries and exposure.\nThe Sir Frederick Banting Legacy Foundation will be celebrating Banting’s birthday at the Banting Heritage Site in Alliston on Thursday, November 14.",
