  "text": "LA CROSSE, Wis. (WEAU) - As the cold winter months are fast approaching, the La Crosse Warming Center is opening for the winter season. This year, they’re offering a little something extra for visitors, 45 reclining chairs. The chairs were donated by Mayo Clinic Health System. “When we shifted over to our new hospital, our old hospital rooms are just there without patients in them. The furniture in there we are looking to rehome to where it makes sense to organizations that serve the community,” says Mayo Clinic community engagement specialist Cindy Shireman. Catholic Charities, who runs the Warming Center, and Mayo Clinic have had a long-time relationship in La Crosse. “Catholic charities is a really good organization. The people that they’re serving deserve dignity, warmth, and hospitality. We’re happy that we can help in this way,” says Shireman. Catholic Charities advancement director Rob Grover says having the donated recliners is great because they were in a place where improvements were needed. “The chairs we had were getting kind of older. They’re heavily used. It’s great to have these new chairs in here for our guests, folks that spend all day on the streets. For them to be able to come in and be in one of these comfortable chairs, being able to recline and sleep, we are so grateful to Mayo for making that happen,” says Grover. Grover adds that as the shelter opens up for the winter season, this donation will mean a lot for the people who come here. “Folks that are used to having nothing or having very little, to be able to come in here and sleep in a spot where the chair is nice and comfortable and newer and fresh, it also helps build dignity into our guests,” says Grover. Mayo Clinic officials say they plan to donate other equipment and furniture from the old hospital to other nonprofit organizations in the area soon. Copyright 2024 WEAU. All rights reserved.",
