  "text": "Free eye camps held in Leh-Ladakh & Spiti A team of doctors from the Mela Mal Sood Rotary Eye Hospital, Palampur, a unit of the Palampur Rotary Eye Foundation, conducted medical camps in the high-altitude areas of Leh-Ladakh and Spiti valley in a bid to provide free eye care to people. The Ophthalmology team of Rotary Hospital examined patients at Kaza, in association with Kaza Community Centre. Rotary Eye Hospital associate director Dr Rohit Kumar examined patients, and conducted 27 surgeries. The doctors of Mela Mal Sood Rotary Eye Hospital also organised half a dozen mega health camps across various regions of Ladakh, benefitting local communities with essential medical services. These health camps aimed to provide comprehensive healthcare services to the local communities of Ladakh. The ophthalmology team was led by director Dr Sudhir Salhotra and Dr Mukesh Kumar. Camps were also conducted in Khaltse, Saspol and Nimmoo of the Sham region. The team also conducted a two-day health camp in Diskit, Nubra Valley. In Leh, the capital city of Ladakh, a two-day health camp was held, where 2,000 eye patients were examined. The Ladakh administration expressed their appreciation and extended gratitude to the organisers and doctors for their dedicated efforts in organising health camps in remote areas of Ladakh. The administration also emphasised the importance of such initiatives in improving health care access and raising awareness about critical health issues among the local population. Talking to The Tribune, Dr Salhotra said, in the past one year, the Palampur Rotary Eye Foundation had organised around 20 medical camps across the state, 8,000 people had been examined and 500 successful eye surgeries had been performed.",
