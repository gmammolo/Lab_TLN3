To prevent prisoners from escaping, the chattering birds patrol along the fence.\nUsually, dogs such as German Shepherds or Malinois are used to protect state institutions. However, in São Pedro de Alcântara, a municipality in Brazil, geese take care of the approximately 1,300 inmates of a correctional facility. The attentive birds patrol along a green strip that lies between a fence and the prison wall. At the slightest movement, they get started.\nCheaper than dogs Geese are considered to be very intelligent \"guard dogs\" and protect their territory from predators. © biky/Imago\nAs the news program Zeit im Bild reports, geese are excellent guard animals. Chattering loudly and with wide-spread wings, the intelligent animals report every unusual movement. And according to the prison director, they are also much cheaper to keep than dogs.\nAccording to a report by Waz-online , geese are not unusual as guardians of the house and yard. The brave fowl is said to have successfully protected the Capitol in Rome as early as 386 BC. In Italy, too, geese are supposedly used on campsites to protect against burglars and theft.\nYou can find even more exciting animal topics in Landtiere.de's free partner newsletter, which you can subscribe to right here.\nThis makes it all the more clever to use geese in a prison as an additional living alarm system. According to local media, the herd consists of around 16 animals. To make them feel comfortable, a small pond is available for them.\nInstagram users joke with amusement: \"They make the prison goose safe\". \"I wouldn't mess with geese either.\" \"Brazil has been paying attention in Latin lessons\". \"One of them wanted to attack me on the Danube. Have respect for them.\" \"Learned from Medias In Res\". \"Goose good idea\".",
