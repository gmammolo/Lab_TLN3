  "text": "ELYRIA, Ohio (WOIO)- The Lorain County Health Department is taking a unique approach to combat illegal dumping with its new Nuisance Abatement Program. “Not only the debris that’s out here, but the public health issues also that exist,” says Mark Adams, Lorain County Public Health Commissioner. Adams is leading the charge against the growing problem of illegal dumping sites. The program partners with the municipal court to provide community service workers with double credit for their time cleaning up these sites. “The trailer I’m standing in was dumped here and then people proceeded to fill it with garbage and debris,” reports 19 News reporter Gabby Hart. “Mark tells me if it wasn’t for programs like the one we’re showing you, a lot of this would continue to sit here and fester, posing a hazard to the community.” “We’ve already taken 139 tires out of here... thousands of mosquitoes can live in those tires,” says Adams. “This is what mice do. This is why we clean things up. Mice spread disease, and it’s just been infested with mice and rats.” He continued. This site in Elyria is just one of hundreds. Trip after trip, load after load, crews are working to eliminate these health hazards. Adams believes this program could be a model for other communities struggling with illegal dumping. “That way we can make it clean in the communities and bring that pride back and say, ‘Hey, the government’s here to help,’” Adams says. The Lorain County Health Department encourages residents to dispose of trash responsibly through recycling centers or trash services. Copyright 2024 WOIO. All rights reserved.",
