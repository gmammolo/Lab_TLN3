  "text": "Younger women being diagnosed with breast cancer, including this Northeast Ohio mom\nYoung mom shares story to raise awareness\nCLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - Being tired is not unusual for a mom of two young children, but something didn’t feel right for Amanda Ibold.\n“I’d rather someone tell me I’m nuts than waking up and thinking I still feel tired,” says Amanda.\nAmanda went to the emergency room, where doctors ran some tests.\nAn abnormality on her left breast was flagged. A mammogram and biopsy revealed Amanda had Stage 2 breast cancer.\nShe was stunned: “Is this seriously happening? I’m 35 years old, fairly healthy, have a family. I’m young and this is happening?”\nAmanda is part of a growing number of younger women being diagnosed with breast cancer.\nThe CDC says 10% of all new breast cancer cases in the United States are women under 45 years old.\n“We’re seeing people, for reasons we don’t know, be diagnosed younger and younger,” says Dr. Ashley Simpson of University Hospitals St. John Medical Center and Seidman Cancer Center.\nDr. Simpson is Amanda’s physician.\nAmanda did not have a family history of breast cancer.\nWhile Dr. Simpson says it’s important to know your family history, being your own advocate is also crucial.\n“Knowing that history you might have an opportunity to screen earlier. If patients don’t have any history, we encourage patients to be very aware of their breast health and do breast exams and monitor any change,” says Dr. Simpson.\nDr. Simpson says doctors also have a learning curve.\nShe says it’s important for physicians to be good listeners when younger patients have concerns:\n“Not only are we hearing them, we‘re also working up their concerns. We can say, ’No, it‘s OK, you’re too young... it’s just benign or it’s not benign... and I’m so glad we caught it and we listened to you.’”\nAfter chemotherapy, a double mastectomy and radiation, Amanda says she is now cancer free.\n“I’m waking up every day just very thankful and even hard days with my kids, I’m like, it could be worse,” Amanda says.\nAs Amanda looks forward to new adventures with her family, she wants other women to learn from her experience.\nAmanda says take action, if something doesn’t feel right.\n“You are the only one who can start the ball. There are always people to help you get it rolling, but you are the only one that can get that going first.”\nThere is a free Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Survivor Seminar Saturday, Nov. 9, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the DoubleTree Hotel in Independence.\nThe event is open to those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, for their caregivers and for health care workers.\nSpeakers include medical experts on breast cancer treatment and screening advancements, a psychologist addressing emotional issues and nutrition and exercise specialists.\nDay of, walk-in registration is available.\nCopyright 2024 WOIO.
