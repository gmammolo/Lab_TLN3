  "text": "Mercy Health Foundation received a grant of $7,500 from the Hope 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation on Thursday in the Mercy Cancer Center. The grant funding will provide mammograms for women who cannot afford them. Since 2009, Mercy Health Foundation has received more than $160,000 in support from Hope 4 You. “Mammograms and early detection are crucial in the fight against breast cancer,” Kim Shriver, director of development for Mercy Health Foundation, said in a statement. “Early detection through regular screenings can significantly increase the chance of successful treatment and survival. Unfortunately, many women in our community face financial barriers that prevent them from accessing these life-saving screenings. This is where HOPE 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation steps in.” “Because the HOPE 4 You board of directors volunteer their time and the HOPE 4 You Breast Cancer Foundation has no paid staff, we are able to share the bulk of our resources,” Kim Sanders, vice president of HOPE 4 You, said in a statement. “We are blessed with strong partnerships at area hospitals that help ensure patients in need of breast imaging services can benefit from these funds.” Hope 4 You’s giving capacity is based on donations from individuals, organizations and fundraisers such as its annual Race 4 Hope, which was held Oct. 20. Kerri Haywood, executive director of operations and imaging for Mercy, said in a statement: “We serve over 25,000 women annually for mammograms and that number is growing more than 10% each year. We simply could not do this without great community partners like HOPE 4 You.” For more information about Mercy Health Foundation, call 417-556-2267 or visit [https://mercy](https://mercy) [healthfoundation.net/communities/swmo-sek](http://healthfoundation.net/communities/swmo-sek).",
