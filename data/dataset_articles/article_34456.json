  "text": "When conflicts arise in a romantic relationship, we often focus on our partner’s emotions and how to make them feel better.\nHowever, being more forgiving of your own shortcomings is beneficial not just for you, but for your significant other, too. A new study highlights the importance of self-compassion.\nSelf-compassion leads to a happy relationship\nIt’s easy to fall into a gloomy spell when fighting with your partner. You are hard on yourself while blaming them for intentionally or unintentionally contributing to the issue.\nBut, approaching problems differently, with a little more compassion and love for yourself, can strengthen your [relationship](https://www.thefocus.news/tag/relationships/).\nA new study conducted by Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg found that heterosexual couples have better chances of being in a happy relationship when women are self-compassionate.\n- DON’T IGNORE:\n[Simple test to spot warning sign early on in the relationships, from a ‘diagnosed narcissist’](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/simple-test-to-spot-warning-sign-early-on-in-the-relationship-from-a-diagnosed-narcissist/)\n“We found that one’s ability to react compassionately to one’s own inadequacies, suffering, and pain in the relationship benefits both members of the couple. In this way, an actor’s self-compassion not only improves their own happiness but also their partner’s,” the study says.\nThe researchers encourage couples to ask themselves “How would I behave towards a boyfriend or girlfriend if he or she were in such a situation?” and apply the same to take care of themself.\nThey believe the findings of the study can be especially beneficial in couples therapy as self-compassion can be trained.\nHappy relationship leads to better health\nA different study led by researchers from the University of California, Davis, discovered that [happy couples experience fewer health issues](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/being-happy-in-your-relationship-can-lead-to-better-health-when-you-grow-older-says-study/).\nFeeling positive about your romantic relationship can act like a “social resource”, which is crucial for overall well-being.\nThe study says our bodies produce less stress hormones when our partners show positive emotions than usual.\nTherefore, healthy relationships provide an “ideal source of support”, especially important in old age when the ability to deal with stress naturally reduces. However, no link was established between stress and the partner’s negative reactions.\nThe observation made by the study holds true in real life, as one couple married for 69 years agrees that the [secret to staying together](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/couple-married-for-69-years-share-their-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-relationship/) is “never fighting.”",
