  "text": "KEARNEY, Neb. — With a shortage of physicians and health professionals across rural areas in Nebraska two healthcare powerhouses are looking to address those issues.\nCHI Health and its academic partner Creighton University School of Medicine are introducing the nations first Rural Track Physician Residency program.\nThis program offers medical training to residents and is ultimately looking to give skilled healthcare providers to rural areas across 90 of Nebraska’s 93 counties and expand opportunities in underserved areas. The inaugural class of the Rural Track Residency program gives the psychiatric residents first hand experience, practicing in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.\nAfter finishing their first year of training at CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center-Bergan Mercy in Omaha, the internal medicine residents began their training at Good Samaritan on Nov. 5. The psychiatric residents will follow in May 2025, relocating from Omaha to Kearney to train at CHI Health Richard Young Behavioral Health Medical Center. with residents beginning their training in Omaha at Creighton and then relocating to Kearney to train at CHI Health.\nDr. Abubakar Tauseef is the program’s newly-appointed site director. He will play a significant role in the day-to-day operations of the program and will guide and support the residents during their training at Good Samaritan. The site director for the psychiatric residents will be named soon.\n“The need for skilled healthcare providers in rural areas is urgent,” says Dr. Tauseef. “Our Rural Track program meets this challenge by offering a comprehensive education to ensure all Nebraskans have access to top-quality medical care. I’m excited to create a supportive environment for our residents and contribute to strengthening the healthcare system in the region.”\nThe first group of internal medicine residents includes Drs. Muhammad Sikandar Karim, Narmada Lavu, Rutvij Patel, and Naimatullah Abdul Rahim. Over the next 20 months the first group of internal medicine residents will provide care at Good Samaritan's 236 bed hospitaland specialty care clinics before dicing into their professional careers in medicine.\n“As a regional referral center and the only Level II trauma center in the area, we offer residents the chance to treat complex, high-acuity patients, much like they would in larger metropolitan cities—right here in Kearney. Working alongside our highly skilled specialists, new graduates have the opportunity to serve a diverse 23-county region and care for patients who are the backbone of American agriculture,” says Curt Coleman, president of CHI Health Good Samaritan.",
