  "text": "Industry News The AgNeighbors Program: Collaborating for Effective Pest Management 11/7/2024 Over the last two years, the Almond Board of California piloted the AgNeighbors Program – an initiative designed to support almond growers in managing the top pest for California almonds more effectively through community collaboration. Led by Jesse Roseman, the program used grant funding to develop a mapping system that allowed smaller acreage growers to find each other and t coordinate implementation of area-wide mating disruption to address the navel orangeworm (NOW) .The program leveraged the advancements in using pheromones for mating disruption — a technology that disrupts the mating process of the navel orangeworm by confusing males with synthetic pheromone signals, along with a mapping system to identify orchard locations where there was interest in implementing/ already implementing mating disruption to create larger areas. \"This project gave small growers the chance to act like large growers,\" Roseman explained, referring to the benefits of using the technology collectively. Currently, large-scale operations are better suited to adopt this non-pesticidal method of pest management because the effectiveness of mating disruption improves with larger treated areas, leaving smaller growers with challenges in adopting the practice.Area-Wide Approach for Small GrowersResearch conducted by the UC Cooperative Extension demonstrated that mating disruption could reduce navel orangeworm damage by up to 53% in blocks as small as 40 acres, with damage reduction increasing to 78% in blocks of 100 acres or more. \"These results clearly illustrate the value of coordination and scale in pest management,\" Roseman said. The AgNeighbors Program used mapping technology developed by Land IQ to help growers identify and connect with neighbors interested in participating, ultimately leading to over 42,000 acres being treated. Funding and PartnershipsThe project initially received funding from California's Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) and ABC contributed some funding to the development of the mapping system This initial grant was crucial in kick-starting the program, allowing the Almond Board of California to begin outreach and coordinate efforts among smaller growers. However, the success of the initial outreach and the demonstrated potential of the program led to additional funding — around $2.1 million — from partnerships with various organizations. These partnerships included the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Pollinator Partnership, and the Coalition for Urban Rural Environmental Stewardship (CURES).The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) played a key role in providing funding to growers through its incentive programs, which aimed to encourage growers to adopt integrated pest management (IPM) practices, including mating disruption. \"We worked with NRCS to develop a concise practice standard for NOW, so growers would know exactly what they needed to do to qualify for these funds,\" Roseman explained. This practice standard helped streamline the process for growers, making it easier for them to apply for and receive financial support.Pollinator Partnership also leveraged the CDPR grant by securing additional funding to combine pest management with pollinator habitat initiatives. This approach aimed to protect pollinators by reducing insecticide use through the adoption of mating disruption, while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality. \"By working together with Pollinator Partnership, we were able to create a multi-benefit project that not only addressed pest control but also supported pollinator health,\" Roseman noted.The Coalition for Urban Rural Environmental Stewardship (CURES) obtained funding from CDFA to implement mating disruption along a water way with insecticide exceedances under the Irrigated Land Regulatory Program (ILRP). The goal was (and is as CURES just received additional funding from CDFA to expand the program) to reduce insecticide use in areas with water quality concerns. AgNeighbors was used to help identify contiguous orchards and interest. \"This funding allowed us to address multiple environmental goals at once — reducing insecticide use for NOW control while also improving water quality thus addressing regulatory requirements of the ILRP,\" Roseman said.In total, the AgNeighbors Program was able to leverage these additional funds to expand the scale and scope of its efforts, ultimately increasing the impact of the program. \"The idea was always that this project would identify growers we could then do follow-up outreach with,\" Roseman said. \"By securing these additional funds, we were able to provide real implementation support, helping growers form neighborhood management blocks and apply for incentive funding to adopt mating disruptions.\"An example of collaborationThe program highlighted the benefits of community collaboration in agriculture. By leveraging partnerships, outreach, and technology, the AgNeighbors Program contributed to improved insect control practices in California’s almond industry. Participating growers not only reduced insect damage in their orchards but also helped achieve broader environmental goals, such as improving water quality. \"This is a great example of different partners working together and playing to their strengths,\" Roseman said. “Even though the goal was education and showing that this tool works, we actually saw an increase in overall adoption,\" Roseman concluded. The program serves as a model for collaborative problem-solving that supports sustainable pest management and agricultural practices. Topics: Integrated Pest Management",
