  "text": "Recently rebranded creative shop SAUCE has launched a new TV campaign for Meals on Wheels South Australia to recruit volunteers to help deliver a warm meal and social connection to thousands of our seniors.\nEmphasising the impact this leaves on the customers, the creative identifies the importance of volunteers and asks the audience to help “Keep the Wheels Turning”.\n“Meals on Wheels is a fantastic organisation providing invaluable support to a large and growing segment of the community. They rely on volunteers to deliver this service, so this is a call to arms to South Australians to get involved,” says SAUCE MD Tom Ootes.\n“We wanted to show the great impact that volunteering has, and how it provides a sense of meaning and purpose,” says David Ormston, co-creative director at SAUCE. “It’s not the meals alone that the customers get out of it, they really value the social aspect from the volunteer.”\nThe TVC supports radio, bus backs and tactical collateral currently in market. While utilising the circular devices of its logo, the meals and the wheels, the visual direction brings an exciting contemporary style to the not-for-profit organisation.\n“We wanted to build on the success of the previous ‘Not Slowing Down’ campaign and create a visually distinctive narrative that would resonate with our audience,” said Michael Gagliardi, co-creative director at SAUCE “The circular device became a key element in the creative, tying the entire campaign together.”\n“To be able to work with Meals on Wheels to help recruit much needed volunteers is an incredible privilege,” says Adele Gibb managing director at Carat. “Our creative agency partner Sauce has made a campaign that really offers an important educational element to audiences who might be considering volunteering and don’t know where to start. Coupled with our strategic media campaign, we are hopeful this campaign will really help turn the dial for Meals on Wheels so it can continue its excellent work in the community.”\n“Keep the Wheels Turning” aims to address the significant decline in volunteer numbers across Australia’s organisations with as little as 40 per cent recommencing the role following the COVID pandemic. Research shows that many potential volunteers face barriers, such as uncertainty about the requirements and suitability for the role. The campaign works to break down these barriers by showcasing the fun and rewarding experience of volunteering with Meals on Wheels.”\nCREDITS\nClient – Meals on Wheels SA\nMarketing & Community Engagement Manager – Vicki Moll\nStrategic Consultant – Tim Emery\nMarketing Officer – Rhiannon Dyrynda\nAgency – SAUCE.
