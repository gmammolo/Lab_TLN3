Navigating feelings of grief, confusion and even anger can be much more difficult during the holiday season, notes Hospice of Ukiah’s Grief and Bereavement Counselor, Kay Lieberknecht.\n“For many years, Hospice of Ukiah has been offering support groups for those grieving a loved one during the holidays,” says Lieberknecht. The free support groups are scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 9 and Saturday, Dec. 7. The groups will take place at the Ukiah United Methodist Church from 10 a.m. to noon. Individuals may choose to attend one or both sessions.\nLieberknecht stresses that anyone who has lost a loved one, regardless of when the person has passed, is invited to attend.\n“Grief has no expiration date. It is not unusual for someone who has lost a loved one to feel overwhelmed as the calendar moves closer to the holidays. We have had people attend the support group who lost a family member many years ago. But because the celebrations of Christmas, Thanksgiving or Hanukah were significant family events, grief can start pouring in unexpectedly and leave people feeling unmoored or overwhelmed,” Lieberknecht continues. “Our grief groups provide a safe, loving atmosphere where individuals may share their direct experiences. From there, we create ways for grieving individuals to honor their loved ones during this tender time.”\nIn addition to the two workshops, Lieberknecht is available for no-cost individual and group counseling sessions. The Methodist Church is located at 270 N. Pine St., room 106. Pre-registration is strongly preferred, but the groups will be open to walk-in attendees if the session hasn’t reached capacity. To pre-register, phone Kay Lieberknecht at (707) 391-1817.\nShare this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Most Popular Most Popular More (unofficial) Mendocino County Election results More (unofficial) Mendocino County Election results Criss, Crane leading in Ukiah City Council race Criss, Crane leading in Ukiah City Council race Controlled burn planned Friday in Ukiah Controlled burn planned Friday in Ukiah Mendocino County Farm Bureau relocates to new office in Ukiah Mendocino County Farm Bureau relocates to new office in Ukiah Measure V passing, Measure W failing in early results Measure V passing, Measure W failing in early results Bartolomie sees likely ‘huge turnout’ in Mendocino County Bartolomie sees likely 'huge turnout' in Mendocino County The Observer: Who closed mental health hospitals in California?
