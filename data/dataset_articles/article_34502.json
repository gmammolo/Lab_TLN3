  "text": "Born in Bilbao in 1924, this chemist discovered in magnesium an ideal complement to improve health and help cope with specific diseases, such as the diabetes she suffered from, and it also helped her get rid of the underwire corset with whom he had lived for more than two decades.\nA balanced diet, rich in protein and supported by magnesium, was the key, its key. And that’s where it all began . But long before Ana María began to weave the networks of what would end up being an international brand, she had already taken firm steps in a man’s world.\nThe Civil War hit her family hard, and they moved to Madrid after the death of Ana María’s father in 1937.\nAlready in the capital he completed his high school studies and, In 1942, he began to study Chemistry at the Complutense University, when science was still a field in which women did not have much space.\nFive years later, Lajusticia not only managed to be one of the first women to finish her degree, but she did so with honors and soon became the head of the Minersa laboratories.\nIt was not until three decades later, already in the 70s, when He began to question his diet. and its deficiencies, in addition to an excess of carbohydrates in her daily life that led the chemist to delve into nutrition studies.\nYour personal experience to grow your brand\nIn 1979 the book with which we began this text came to light and then it all began.\n«The discovery on your own skin of how much and good a corrected and adjusted diet can do, turned the Basque into the champion of the magnesium cause and other elements that do so much good for our health,” they detail in their official biography.\nThat personal experience that most truthfully supported his statements was the spark that ignited success. The brand ‘Ana María Lajusticia’ was born.\nIf you go to the sales website now, you will find various products for the joints, emotional balance, muscle relaxation cardioprotectors, sleep products, vitamins… a whole world where we can choose what our body asks of us.\nA public humiliation and a blip in his success\nThis success of decades, however, has not been free of detractors or ups and downs in which its continuity as a company came to be jeopardized.\nPart of the scientific community always turned its back on him and his confrontation with the doctor was very famous. Francisco Grande Covián friend and colleague of Severo Ochoa, during the program ‘La Clave’ on TVE’s La2 that was presented by José Luis Balbín.\nIn that gathering, the famous nutritionist and researcher called her a fake, which caused her emerging products to begin to be viewed with suspicion.\nCovián was convinced that Lajusticia was a “undocumented and irresponsible” as he mentioned in one of his books. Time, the truth is, has taken away his reason.\nThe salvation of sport and a gigantic legacy\nAnd the use of magnesium and collagen is more topical than ever and can be found in countless specialized centers and even supermarkets, echoing an idea, a study, a work that began in Spain with Ana María Lajusticia.\nAfter the incident in ‘The Key’ and its negative repercussions, sport served as a lifesaver for the company, given the positive effects on worked and demanded bodies of the products they sold.\nThe course of life changed again and the impact of Lajusticia grew again to the giant we know today. His steps in a world that was not going to give him any ease They ended up making a path that is now passable forever.\n#Ana #María #Lajusticia #pioneer #humiliated #doctor #television #built #empire #convictions",
