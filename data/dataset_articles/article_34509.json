Exclusive time with the thought leaders who craft our research. The news: OpenNotes and Abridge are partnering to study how AI-generated visit summary notes can benefit patients. Digging into the details: In the study’s initial phase, focus groups will be given visit summaries created by Abridge’s tech and evaluate them for usefulness, accessibility, and other effectiveness metrics. Why it matters: Many health tech companies have focused on how AI can reduce clinicians’ administrative burden, but there’s been comparatively little research on how patients can benefit from AI in their EHR.
