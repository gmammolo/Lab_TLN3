  "text": "Mount St. Mary’s University celebrated the grand opening of the Blue Peak Center for Applied Behavior Analysis with an open house on November 8. The Center will provide support and care for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities using evidence-based therapy to help children develop the skills needed to thrive in society.\n“Nationally, 1 in 36 children is diagnosed with autism, and we know that families of children with autism require support to navigate the unique challenges these children face,” said President Jerry Joyce, Ph.D. “The need is great, and the Mount is proud to respond to this significant community need through the launch of the Blue Peak Center.”\n\"I would like to thank the Daughters of Charity for partnering with us as well as all those who donated to support the renovation of this beautiful facility,\" President Joyce continued. \"Among these, Mrs. Mary Pat Cardoni was able to be with us this evening. The Blue Peak Center Lobby is named in honor of her husband Robert Cardoni, a Class of 1975 Mount alumnus.\"\n“Emmitsburg and the surrounding communities have very few services available to them,” said Alexa Mochan, M.Ed., BCBA, LBA, clinical director of the Blue Peak Center. “Our goal is to provide a local place where families can trust that their children are getting the best, personalized services.”\nThe Blue Peak Center, which is affiliated with the university’s Master of Science in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) program, will also provide experiential learning opportunities for students who are pursuing either graduate or undergraduate degrees at the Mount. “By providing learning opportunities for Mount students that expand their skill sets, we also help meet the need for skilled ABA practitioners that will enter the workforce,” Mochan added.\n\"Arriving here is the result of several years of work to build the outstanding ABA educational program and represents a dream realized in extending this important work to support our local community by providing much-needed applied behavior analysis services,\" said Dean of the School of Health Professions Christine McCauslin, Ph.D. McCauslin recognized Griffin Rooker, BCBA, Ph.D., director of the Master of Applied Behavior Analysis academic program, for his \"bold vision for a center that would support graduate student training while supporting families in need.\"\nWith each child having a dedicated staff member to guide their learning process, Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) and Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) will provide early intensive behavior intervention (EIBI) to young pre-kindergarten children with autism from infancy to age six. EIBI services provide opportunities for children to develop social, communication and daily living skills in support of their overall independence.\nThe 4,500-square-foot center, located in the university’s School of Health Professions near downtown Emmitsburg, Maryland, includes a sensory room that offers a space for children to regulate; a group learning space for circle time, work at a sensory table and group play such as art and movement activities; a playroom that encourages both structured and unstructured play; and space for one-on-one learning and assessments. Group activities that are like those in a preschool setting will support children in making a smoother transition to a school setting.\nBlue Peak is conducting consultations with families and assessments of children and will begin providing care to children on December 1. The center, located at 343 South Seton Avenue in Emmitsburg, serves individuals in Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Blue Peeks services are insurance-funded and the Center accepts insurance providers such as CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, Medicaid, Tricare and Aetna.\nTo learn more about the Blue Peak Center, visit [bluepeakcenter.org](https://bluepeakcenter.org), send an email to [bluepeakcenter@msmary.edu](mailto:bluepeakcenter@msmary.edu) or call 301-447-5090.",
