  "text": "French Creek Family YMCA, 2010 Recreation Lane in Avon, hosted a launch party Nov.6 to unveil the new EGYM Smart Fitness Equipment. The new line of exercise equipment introduces members to an efficient and fun workout specifically tailored for them, said Joe Cerny, district executive director of the French Creek, which is one of 50 YMCAs in the country to introduce the equipment. Using a gamified system, the program is broken down into four different machines which target different core areas, like upper body, lower body and cardio, Cerny said. The system is capable of remembering users after on-boarding, he said. Each workout is timed with specific user settings to ensure efficient timing. “It analyzes your body and it creates your bio age,” Cerny said. “All those things are sound-tracked by the system, and you’re increasingly trying to reduce your bio age against your actual age.” The machines not only help keep participants engaged with simple games, but help them understand specific workouts and what is done for the body with a digital screen. According to Cerny, the program can help reduce intimidation for those who are new to fitness and may not know where to start. “It’s a really efficient, healthy workout,” he said. “I think one of the greatest barriers to fitness is people are intimidated and then they don’t know what to do-. “This reduces both of those issues.” Though there are only a few machines, Cerny said the system provides users with a full-body workout with all the information they need. As users grow in their fitness journey, settings on the machines change to accommodate strength levels. “It makes them really think about what they’re doing with their exercise,” Cerny said. “Everything else you can experience in the world of wellness starts opening up to you.” According to Cerny, over nine months of research went into the smart equipment to determine if it would benefit members. He said the users have had an “overwhelming response” to the new addition, and 250 on-boarding sessions were scheduled over the course of two days. “We really think it’s the right thing at the right time,” Cerny said. “It was a significant investment, but we really think our community’s going to benefit from that investment.” The unique system is built for all ages and fitness levels, and can help make exercise simpler for some users, he said. “This is so exciting, no one else has anything like this,” Cerny said.
