Actually, it tends to be pretty toasty throughout the year. My entire front and back yard are artificial grass because my pup prefers grass for her bathroom romps, and with water being such an expensive commodity, artificial was the way to go. Unfortunately, this grass tends to warm up quite a bit, and I worry about my dog’s paws.\nShelterLogic developed a portable solution for this common problem: a doggy canopy! I had seen this around but never tried it out until now, and here is how it fared as a solution to my dilemma.\nAbout ShelterLogic\nFounded in 1991, ShelterLogic is a brand that focuses on providing shelters for anything you need! From protecting your car and tools from the elements to shelters for farm animals and greenhouse plants, ShelterLogic has aimed to create affordable, efficient, and durable products. Throughout the company’s success, ShelterLogic has become a go-to option for anyone enjoying the outdoors. As of late, ShelterLogic has expanded to creating canopies and shady areas for dogs and other household pets!\nShelterLogic not only creates shelter for your beloved pets, but the company is also very big on social responsibility and philanthropy. ShelterLogic donates to local shelters and often raises money for causes they strongly believe in.\nDog Shade Canopy Overview\nCheck Price on ShelterLogic Here is an overview of the Blue Dog Shade and why it is one of the best options for a shady retreat for your pup.\nSizes Available The ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy is currently available in three different sizes:\n2-foot width x 2.5-foot height x 2.5-foot length (this size is good for small breed dogs) 4-foot width x 4-foot height x 5-foot length (this size is excellent for medium to large-size dogs) 4-foot width x 3-foot height x 4-foot length (this size is suitable for medium-sized dogs). The shelter only comes in the flattering royal blue color.\nPricing and Shipping Price is based upon the size selected:\n2ft x 2.5ft x 2.5ft = $55.99 4ft x 4ft x 5ft = $79.99 4ft x 3ft x 4ft = $59.99 ShelterLogic does accept the Affirm service, so you can break the price down into monthly payments if wanted. Shipping is free!\nBuild, Materials, and Design Each Blue Dog Shade Canopy size comes with the same items within the box: The frame, the cover, and a bag of auger anchors.\nThe frame is made of strong steel, with a 1-inch/2.5-centimeter diameter, and coated with a premium powder finish.\nThe cover is made of Polyester 600 Denier, which is fire-resistant, water-resistant, and has a UV-ray protective coating. Velcro lining is what secures the cover to the frame.\nThe anchors are 15-inch auger anchors made of steel.\nThe ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy is outfitted with nylon foot plates that help keep the shelter securely in place without damaging anything! You can place this canopy on a deck and patio and be fine; there will be no issues with your wood.\nDurability This is one of the most durable shelters due to the premium materials and thoughtfulness that went into designing the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy!\nTo start, the powder coating on the steel frame is resistant to chipping, peeling, rust, and corrosion—all of which tend to be problems with outdoor furniture since the canopy will be consistently exposed to the elements.\nThe blue cover is coated to resist UVB and UVA rays, so you won’t have any color bleaching or fading due to the sun. The Polyester 600 Denier material is resistant to fire and water, making the shelter unable to burn and fine in rain storms. The cover also can’t be ripped.\nThe anchors are made of durable steel, so nothing will happen to them either!\nEase Of Construction and Use The ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy is designed to be very simple to build. The design is simply a frame, a canopy tarp, and some anchors.\nThe instructions are clear and assist with putting the frame together. Then, you pull the cover over and secure it with the velcro. Anchors can then be added to keep the frame from moving around. No screws are required except when doing the feet, everything else is like putting a Lego together – super simple.\nWarranty The ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy comes with a one-year warranty. Considering that the canopy is intended for everyday use (as a permanent fixture in your yard), I feel like the company confidently stands by its product.\nYou can submit a warranty claim directly on the ShelterLogic website by completing the warranty form.\nIn Summary Pros Three different sizes Fire-resistant, water-resistant UVB, & UVA ray-resistant Rust, corrosion, chipping, peeling resistant frame Nylon foot plates Anchors included Easy assembly Affordable One-year warranty Cons Velcro can detach with wind\nKey Features\nCheck Price on ShelterLogic Easy Construction I’m not a handy person, but I was able to put this together. It’s much simpler than Ikea furniture!\nDurability Being water-proof, fire-proof, UV-ray resistant, unable to corrode and rust, and coated to prevent chipping and peeling, I would say that this is probably one of the most durable canopies for your pet out there.\nNylon Foot Plates WIth Steel Anchors The nylon foot plates allow you to use the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy on decks and patios without worrying about destroying the wood. The steel anchors help secure the canopy when placed on dirt, ground, sand, or grass.\nKeeps Your Pets Cool And Safe From The Elements Using a canopy for your dogs is beneficial in many ways: your pup can have a nice shady spot to rest outside, escape from the rain , and keep the ground cool if you need a safe potty area in hot climates.\nIs the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy a Good Value? I will be honest with you, my jaw dropped to the floor when I saw the price of the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy. Ranging in price from only $55.99 to $79.99, this is the most affordable high-quality canopy I have ever personally seen. Considering the build materials and durability of the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy, I honestly cannot believe that is all it costs.\nYou can go to a different store and buy your pup a $25 tent or canopy, but I can promise that it will get destroyed quickly when left outside daily. You’ll be running to buy another one a quickly as you bought the first one. The ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy is intended for long-term use and will withstand much abuse. A one-time fee of $55.99 (with free shipping even!) on something that I can leave in my yard endlessly is an incredible value, not just a good one.\nCheck Price on ShelterLogic\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy only intended for dogs? Although dogs tend to be significant users of shades like this, the canopy is not only for pups. Rabbits, cats, and other household pets can also benefit.\nIs the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy portable and easy to transport? Can I use it on road trips? Yes! This canopy is easy to disassemble and is small enough to be portable for beach trips , camping trips, and other adventures.\nCan you get a replacement part if you lose a part or something happens? ShelterLogic offers replacement parts for any component that may be missing or damaged—just call the company at 1-800-932-9344 for assistance.\nOur Experience With the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy As I mentioned in my intro, my dog Lorelei and I are residents of Southern California, where temperatures hit the hundreds in the summer. Unlike other states, our temperatures don’t go down most of the year, so it’s toasty like… 9 months out of the year. My entire front and back yards are artificial grass, which heats up quite a bit. I was very excited to get the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy as a way to have a nice, cool, shady spot for my dog. I opted for the 4-foot width x 3-foot height x 4-foot length size as that would be perfect for my pup.\nAssembly is required, but I found it pretty simple, even as someone who is not savvy about building things. The instructions are clear, and all parts are well-marked – I wasn’t confused about what is what. Admittedly I am a bit traumatized from Ikea furniture and expect everything to be like that, and this certainly was not – it was so easy! I did find that pulling the canopy over was a bit more difficult for me. I am not a very strong person, and that is very taut and tight. But, it was well worth the endeavor, and I can always ask for my spouse’s help if need be.\nEven in the bright, beating sun, the area underneath the canopy remained very pleasant! I kept moving it around between days when I didn’t have time to sit in the yard with my dog because of work (in which case, the shade was just to keep a potty area at a walkable temperature) and as a resting spot when we had time to spend outside. This size provided 8 square feet of shade coverage for my dog.\nThere was an unusual day in which the wind kicked up full force, and I wondered what would happen to my canopy! The anchors held it in place strong, so the frame itself didn’t move anywhere. A few velcro spots started coming a bit undone with strong gusts, but not enough to pull the actual canopy fabric off – it was a quick fix. I felt like the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy is really durable and sturdy, and I don’t think it would ever fall on my pup (I have complete confidence)!\nLorelei enjoys it, and as long as she spends time underneath there, it’s a 10/10 in my book!\nCheck Price on ShelterLogic\nConclusion In finality, I should have gotten the ShelterLogic Blue Dog Shade Canopy a lot sooner than I did – it has really fixed many issues with living in such a sun-beating hot environment ! My dog has a cool spot to do her business, and I don’t have to worry about her paws as much.\nThe fact that the canopy can be so easily moved is also fantastic, both for when I clean the area and when I need the canopy to just be a chill, shady spot for her to get some fresh air and relax!",
