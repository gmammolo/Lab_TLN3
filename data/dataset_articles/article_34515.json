  "text": "ISSUE 27 November 8, 2024 SUBSCRIBE PAST ISSUES\nHello! You deep-seeker who wants to keep it real. Let’s have a SACRED WEEKEND. Two Fridays a month, only here. With Love, Danielle\nHello Love,\nI’m sending Radiance and Compassion for whatever you’re looking for right now.\nWe keep breathing into our hearts and holding visions of harmony.\nLove no matter what.\nTeam humanity. xo D\nLET’S ROLL 💗 Friday: A Note On Suffering + Healing\n✨ Saturday: How To Stop Pain From Turning Into Suffering\n🧘 Sunday: My Favourite Practices\n🌟 The Week: Astro Flow + Events\nA NOTE ON SUFFERING… AND HEALING Can we avoid suffering? Like, avoid it altogether?\nI’ve had this conversation with Rabbis and a lot of deeper thinkers. And a life sans suffering doesn’t seem to be on the human curriculum.\nBut! If you lean into your suffering, you can lessen it. I’ll take it.\nMitigating suffering goes like this: When we get even slightly enthusiastic about the cleansing and healing process, and we more willingly make an effort to work with our Soul, then we don’t suffer quite so severely. LEAN IN TO IT, babe. It’s a Dylan Thomas, “ Go willingly into the night ” kind of thing.\nAnandamayi Ma (1896-1982) was a Bengali Saint. A beauty beyond beauties. She was gifted with precognition and faith healing. Her name translates to “joy-permeated,” a title given to her by devotees for her perpetual state of divine joy.\nHer teachings hit my heart. This one, though, is extra pure:\n“It is by suffering that suffering is overcome, because without suffering very few would see the need for self-purification which leads to the unfoldment of our Immortal Self.”\n– Anandamayi Ma\nI find amazing relief in this paradox: “ It is by suffering that suffering is overcome. ”\nWhen we let the suffering expand us, remake us, we become more Loving. Closer to our True Nature. And thus, ultimately… we suffer less.\nWhen the next challenge comes around it’s less terrifying, less… offensive. It’s more manageable.\nAnd in between prana breathing, and endurance, and problem-solving, and surrendering to the Infinite…we might find a few minutes of delight in there. And satisfaction that we’re transmuting the challenge into consciousness. Like healers do.\nOr maybe—and this is equally enlightened and acceptable—maybe it just sucks to the maximum point of sucking. When the suffering is almost intolerable. When you’ve had all you think you can take. When you can’t comprehend what the f*cking “ gift in the pain ” might be… there’s this:\nMay my suffering be of service.\nAt the very least.\nMay some good come of this.\nIf not for me, for someone else.\nSome good.\nAt the very least.\nMay my suffering be of service.\nIt’s a sublime Buddhist approach to pain. When you’re in hell, the notion that your agony might have some Divine utility can help you endure. It’s a light ray of reason.\nEither way—whether you’ve danced into the dark, or the demons dragged you through it—when you’re on the other side of it (and you will get to the other side), your wisdom is going to comfort someone else, perhaps many people, profoundly.\nIt’s a prayer, really: May this suffering be of service.\nAnd so it is.\nThis is a short playlist I made at a dark time of my life.\nIt’s very literal. I didn’t have the energy for nuance. I just wanted straight up, merciful messaging.\nI played it on repeat driving, crying, yoga’ing.\nIt helped.\nGOD MERCY I Playlist Want to learn more about leaning into suffering?\nYou might want to listen to EP 110 of WITH LOVE, DANIELLE .\nThe Golden Blue Chalice Meditation is one of my favourite practices, ever.\nI’ve been working with another daily practice for about a year and a half, but I’m thinking about going back to this beauty.\nIt’s not for everyone. It has some visual complexity to it. But if you feel called, please give it a trial run in your life.\nIt’s a very powerful energy cleanser.\nAn “altar in your heart” is the center of this visualization. And it helps us come to realize that the heart chakra IS actually an altar. And what we give to the heart, we give over for healing.\nSHOP HERE My shop with meditations and practices is back open after renovations!
