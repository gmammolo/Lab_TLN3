She is also co-chair of this year's Canadian Space Health Research Symposium taking place on the Western campus, \"You need to bring together experts from all different fields - from engineering or medicine and molecular biology and psychology - in order to think about what you need to do and how you can keep people healthy and live in a very low resource, extremely isolated, confined environment.\"\nResearchers have come from across Canada and around the world to share ideas designed to improve the health and safety of astronauts.\nResearchers looking at health issues in space gather at Western University (Gerry Dewan/CTV News London)\nWhile most people in Canada have relatively easy access to health care, distance can be a complicating factor - it's the same in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is only about 400km above sea level. Gallagher said illness on the ISS is less of a challenge than illness on the longer journeys being considered, \"It's really hard to keep people healthy and alive in space. And those challenges just get even greater as you go farther away; as you go beyond low-earth orbit to the Moon and eventually to Mars.\"\nDr. Dave Williams is a retired Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut, \"We're now talking about medical autonomy, developing a technology, the capabilities to be able to take care of people and deliver sophisticated medical care in these remote environments.\"\nWilliams was a mission specialist on two space shuttle missions and was the first non-American to hold a senior management position within NASA. He's had an extensive medical career, including time as an emergency room physician. He believes Canada has a unique perspective on remote medicine, \"I think the clinical capability that we have in northern Canada could be looked at as an analog for space medicine research.\"\nCanadian Space Agency acting director Mathieu Caron said Canada bolstered its reputation in robotics with the Canadarm and could now play a significant role in space health research – benefitting not only the space program but also many young Canadians.\nCanadian Space Agency acting director Mathieu Caron addresses Canadian Space Health Research Symposium at Western University.(Gerry Dewan/CTV News London)\nHe pointed to London-native Jeremy Hanson, who is set to become the first non-American to circle the moon during next year's NASA Artemis 2 mission. Caron told CTV News, \"The astronauts have a huge inspirational factor that can serve as a catalyst for further research and development activities. But also to encourage the younger generation to go into STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Math]... to the benefit of Canada as a whole.\"\nOne of the more interesting research paths presented at the symposium came from teams out of Western University and Michigan Technical University who were working together. Their paper looks at converting asteroids into food. According to Sarah Gallagher, “You can't do the groceries for three years of food. You need to be able to produce it while you're traveling. So, it's kind of a crazy idea making food from asteroids - but it turns out they have carbon, that, you know, that most of our food is made up of.\"\nThe symposium wraps up on Friday.\nLondon Top Stories\n'I’d just end up on the street somewhere': disabled Londoner fears impact of council's new restriction on indoor resting spaces\nVIDEO VIDEO | Teenage girls assaulted by woman on school property\nLondoner cashes in with $2.5 million win in Lotto 6/49 Jackpot\nLDCSB confirms 'Leadership Planning Session' cost over $16,000\n'It's really hard to keep people healthy and alive in space': Western University symposium promotes work in space health\n'I didn't feel safe': witness saw two masked men at bush party, testimony continues in fatal shooting\nHanover boil water advisory expected to last until at least Friday\nWindsor driver charged in Brooke-Alvinston collision CTVNews.ca Top Stories\nSparks fly as MPs question minister on pension implications of proposed election date change Sparks flew at a parliamentary committee Thursday as MPs questioned Canada's democratic institutions minister about a widely opposed provision in electoral reform legislation that seeks to delay the next fixed election date by one week.\n'There is no electricity': Canadian travellers in Cuba urge caution in hurricane's wake Cuba's power grid was knocked out by Hurricane Rafael, which ripped across the country as a Category 3 storm.
