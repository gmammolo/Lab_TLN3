  "text": "play video Some attendees at the launch of the community games\nThe University of Ghana’s Sports and Wellness Directorate has officially launched the University Community Games, a major initiative aimed at enhancing community engagement and promoting wellness through sports.\nAt the launch, Dr. Austin Wontepagah Luguterah, Director of the Sports and Wellness Directorate, highlighted the importance of a national sports policy for Ghana.\n“Political manifestos come and go, but policies are commitments to the nation. It’s time we implement a dedicated sports policy that will serve as a national asset, beyond party politics,” Dr. Luguterah stated, expressing frustration that, despite decades since Ghana’s independence, a comprehensive sports policy has yet to be fully established.\nHe elaborated, “While party manifestos offer a vision, they aren’t binding commitments. A national sports policy is long overdue, and I’ve been part of the drafting process. It’s crucial we implement it so that sports development doesn’t fluctuate with political cycles.”\nDr. Luguterah acknowledged the foundational work laid by his predecessors, notably Dr. Owusu Ansah, who established the Sports Directorate, and Dr. Bella, who set up key policies.\n“My administration will build on their work to make these initiatives even more effective and attractive to Ghanaians,” he added.\nEmphasising a commitment to facility maintenance and programme development, Dr. Luguterah noted, “I came into an environment with well-established sports facilities, and my administration will ensure they are kept in prime condition. We aim to make the University of Ghana’s sports program not only sustainable but a model of excellence.”\nWatch the full video below:",
