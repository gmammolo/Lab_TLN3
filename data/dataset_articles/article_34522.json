  "text": "In September, Chloe Potes’ mother, Kristene Potes, made a surprise visit to campus to see her freshman daughter. Chloe was surprised by the drop-in; she’d only been on campus for a few weeks and wasn’t due for a family visit for a while.\nChloe, a justice studies major, and her mom were relaxing in a hotel together when Kristene broke the news: Chloe’s father, Ryan, had been officially diagnosed with stage two multiple myeloma.\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells located in bone marrow, according to the American Cancer Society. Overgrowth of plasma in bone marrow can crowd out healthy plasma, leading to low blood counts. Multiple myeloma also affects bone strength by breaking them down faster than they’re supposed to, making bones fragile and brittle.\n“I didn’t even know how to process it,” Chloe said. “It was so hard for me. I would constantly worry, ‘What if this happens?’”\nChloe returned to her dorm confused and upset. She wasn’t only three and a half hours away from her home of Virginia Beach anymore; she was now three and a half hours away from her best friend who needed all the support he could get, she said.\nRyan, 49, was diagnosed Sept. 14 after visiting the emergency room for what the family assumed was just a typical illness. He’s currently undergoing chemotherapy.\nChloe said her father’s health seemed to decline quickly once he was officially diagnosed. Ryan’s spine fractured due to the weakening of his bones, making him unable to move around freely. There’s nothing doctors can do to reverse the injury, Chloe said, but they’re planning to run tests to find a procedure that will help restore his mobility.\nA GoFundMe was created by a friend of the Potes family to raise money for hospital bills and to purchase items such as an adjustable bed for Ryan to sleep in while at home. For a month, Ryan slept on a recliner chair, since he couldn’t walk up the stairs to his bedroom. Kristene slept beside his chair, bringing a twin-sized mattress down to the living room to stay by her husband’s side.\nIn October, the family raised enough money through the GoFundMe — which is about to hit $50,000 — to purchase the adjustable bed for Ryan.\n“That was the best sleep of my life,” Ryan said after his first night out of the recliner chair. “I have not slept this good in so long.”\nChloe was surprised by the amount of people who donated to the fundraiser, some of whom she hadn’t spoken to in years.\n“It’s comforting knowing when I’m not there, he still has a lot of support and people helping him,” Chloe said.\nDue to the chemotherapy’s side effects, Ryan started to lose hair, so he decided to buzz it all off. Freshman exploratory major Hunter Kelly, Chloe’s childhood friend, did the same thing.\nKelly said he was “shocked” by Ryan’s diagnosis and wanted to offer all the support he could, as he considers the Potes’ family like his own. He’s spent a lot of time with Chloe to make sure she’s doing OK while at school, she said.\nDeciding to shave his head wasn’t easy, but it was something Kelly wanted to do show the Potes his unwavering support.\n“Shaving my head felt like a really cool thing to do for her dad,” Kelly said. “I look nothing like I did.”\nNo one told Kristene and Ryan about Kelly shaving his head, so the FaceTime they received immediately after came as a huge surprise. Chloe said her parents were in “complete shock,” which quickly turned into wide smiles and pure gratitude.\nChloe posted about Kelly shaving his head on TikTok, where it’s amassed over 1 million likes and 5 million views. The family has earned over $500 more in donations from this video alone.\nKnowing she wouldn’t be home as much to help her dad, Chloe reached out to Dean of Students Hollie Hall to try to raise awareness on campus about Ryan’s illness.\nChloe wants to organize a campus-wide 5K with her gymnastics club to raise money and is currently working out the logistics.\n“I know a lot of people around the community also like to support and participate in things like this,” Chloe said. “I’m gauging interest in it right now.”\nHall, whose job includes helping students find resources as well as aiding them in both academic and social endeavors, gave Chloe a rundown of what setting up an event such as a 5K would entail and offered assistance every step of the way.\n“The most important message that I want students to get from Chloe’s story is that you are a member of a university that cares about our students,” Hall wrote in an email to The Breeze. “Regardless of what it is that you are trying to balance while being a student here, you do not have to carry the weight alone.”\nChloe said she’s very thankful to the JMU community — both her friends and the university staff — for checking in on her during her time away from home.\n“If I ever talked to anyone about JMU, they always say the community is so nice,” Chloe said. “I didn’t really believe it at first, but after talking to my professors and the dean and my friends, so many people have been making sure I’m okay and checking in on me all the time.”",
