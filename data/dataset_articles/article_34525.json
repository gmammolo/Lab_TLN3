  "text": "Businesses sponsor innovative children’s mental health programme A group of North East businesses is tackling the growing mental health crisis among children by sponsoring an innovative storytelling intervention to improve wellbeing. This year, [Muckle LLP](https://www.muckle-llp.com), [Ryder Architecture](https://www.ryderarchitecture.com), [Sorella Sorella](https://sorellasorella.com) and [Square One Law](https://squareonelaw.com) are sponsoring MELVA, an award-winning programme developed by creative learning charity [Mortal Fools](https://www.mortalfools.org.uk). MELVA uses storytelling, engaging characters, and interactive activities to teach children vital mental health skills, such as emotional literacy and resilience, through annual school licenses. Maria Brooks, director of operations at Square One Law, said: “Now, more than ever, supporting young people’s mental health is absolutely crucial, and Mortal Fools is leading the way with their innovative MELVA programme. “We’re happy to play a small part in helping to bring MELVA to local schools - by using storytelling to teach practical wellbeing techniques, they make mental health accessible and engaging for children.” Her comments were echoed by Nicola Leyden, director of HR at Muckle LLP, who added: “We are delighted to have been able to support Mortal Fools through its MELVA programme for a second year. “The work they do in encouraging young people to increase their knowledge and understanding of mental health and connect with a language enabling them to talk about this openly is extremely important and is something we wholeheartedly support through our grant funding here at Muckle.” Responding to alarming statistics from Public Health England, which reveal that one in five UK children face mental health challenges, MELVA serves as a preventative resource accessible to all children, focusing on early intervention and self-management techniques. As Richard Wise, partner at Ryder Architecture, suggests: “MELVA has never been more relevant. It tackles issues of anxiety, confidence and mental health in an imaginative and engaging way. “At a time when school budgets are being squeezed more than ever, support from local businesses enables children and young people across the region and beyond to benefit from the programme.” Kiz Crosbie, Mortal Fools CEO & artistic director, added: “Sponsorship from compassionate and civic-minded businesses has enabled us to remove significant barriers for schools to access MELVA, placing effective mental health resources directly into the hands of the children who need it most. “The more businesses like this we work with, the more children we can reach. We would love more businesses to invest in MELVA, so we can reach even more young people.” Looking to promote your product/service to SME businesses in your region?
