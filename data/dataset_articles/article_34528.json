  "text": "For many, a strong appetite is the biggest hurdle to dieting, and even stars who strive to maintain healthy, beautiful bodies have shared their battles with cravings. To inspire their fans, they've revealed their tips for suppressing appetite. Model Lee So-ra shared her diet tips on her YouTube channel, recommending a satisfying dinner heavy on protein, vegetables and grains. \"If you eat only a little for dinner to diet, you may feel hungry and unable to sleep. When that happens, brush your teeth. No one wants to brush their teeth again after eating something. It helps to think, 'I've already brushed my teeth, so I'll hold off,'\" she said. She also suggested chewing gum when cravings are strong, adding, \"If you still can't resist, try imagining how light you'll feel the next day.\" For an added deterrent, she recommended placing box tape on the refrigerator door to remind yourself not to give in. Singer and artist Solbi shared a different tip on her channel while talking with entertainer Yoo Byung-jae. Her go-to appetite suppressant? Cucumbers. \"I didn't meet people much, and I ate a lot of cucumbers. When I felt like snacking, I ate mini cucumbers,\" she said. Solbi also noted she walked a lot as part of her routine. On SBS Power FM's \"Escape at 2 O'Clock Cultwo Show,\" she again mentioned cucumbers, saying she'd carry mini cucumbers everywhere, even eating them when feeling hungry at night. Cucumbers are low in calories and high in fiber, making them ideal for dieters. Actor Kang So-ra recommended drinking apple cider vinegar to curb appetite. On her YouTube channel, she said, \"I drink apple cider vinegar. I heard the microbes in our gut love it, and it makes my stomach feel good. It also seems to suppress appetite a bit.\" Apple cider vinegar has become a favorite among dieters for its health benefits. Dieting remains crucial for health, and stars continue to seek ways to maintain beautiful, healthy bodies without falling into yo-yo cycles. Their efforts and tips offer a glimpse into the challenges and dedication behind their fitness routines.
