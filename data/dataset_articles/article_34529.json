  "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - The push continues for the Mid-South to lose one million pounds in three years. So far, Mid-Southerners have lost more than 8,300 pounds as part of Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare’s Healthier 901 Challenge . One group of women is jumping into the initiative with double dutch . With each hop, skip and jump, the ladies of Double Dutch Therapy are empowering other women to get healthy and have fun doing it! “Double Dutch Therapy is just not about double dutch. It‘s about a sisterhood, it‘s about wellness, it’s about fitness, it’s about coming together and saying, ’you as my sister, I care,’” said Double Dutch Therapy Founder Selena Cook. The group started in May but already has chapters in Delaware, California, Illinois, Memphis and Batesville. Cook says no matter your level of skill…there’s room for everyone to “jump” in on the fun. “The criteria to join Double Dutch Therapy is you have to be a woman over 39 and that’s it,” Cook said. Each lady donned their age on the back of their shirts. The group’s oldest member lives in California and is 92 (and a half) years old! Cook says when she learned about the Healthier 901 Challenge, she knew she wanted Double Dutch Therapy to be involved. The group went to this year’s Healthier 901 Fest, showing off their skills and recruiting new members. “We received over 66 emails from Healthier 901 saying ‘how can I join the challenge that’s encouraging people to lose collectively a million pounds’...who wouldn’t want to be a part of that?” Cook said. If jumping isn’t your thing, the group also line dances, hula hoops and does hopscotch. Michelle Vinne, Co-leader for the Memphis Chapter of Double Dutch Therapy, says it makes her feel like a kid again. “It reminds me of my childhood. Just good memories. The things we used to do. We were so free back then, and things are so restricted now. The kids don’t even come outside for the most part now. So it’s just a joy to do something now that we used to have the pleasure of doing as children,” Vinne said. To join the Double Dutch Therapy group or the Healthier 901 Challenge, click here .
