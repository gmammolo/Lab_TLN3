  "text": "[VITEC](/suppliers/vitec/) Stadiums and venues around the world recognise that success hinges on more than just what happens on the pitch. More than ever, fan engagement within each facility is a critical part of the overall… [read more](/suppliers/vitec/) ExerciseNZ (the Exercise Association of New Zealand) is urging men to boost their health through physical activity during the annual Movember campaign. Held each November to raise awareness and funds for men’s health issues, particularly prostate cancer, testicular cancer, mental health and suicide prevention, ExerciseNZ President Richard Beddie notes that while there is strong support for men to grow moustaches throughout the month to spark conversations around men's health, Movember also promotes other health initiatives like the Move for Movember campaign, which encourages people to get active and raise awareness about the benefits of physical activity for mental and physical well-being. As Movember kicks off, ExerciseNZ is emphasising the crucial role of regular physical activity in promoting men's health, particularly in reducing the risk of prostate cancer and improving mental well-being. Recent findings from ExerciseNZ’s 2024 consumer research reveal that mental health now rates as the second most important reason to exercise among men, following general health by only a few percent. Many men report that exercise not only enhances how they feel but that the social connections fostered in structured exercise programs offer additional mental health benefits. This aligns well with Movember's focus on mental well-being and social support, underscoring the value of men talking openly about their challenges and supporting one another through physical activity. The Move for Movember campaign provides a supportive space where men can openly discuss their challenges while staying physically active. The challenge - to walk 60 km throughout November - honours the 60 men who die by suicide each hour worldwide. Walking just 90 minutes per week at a comfortable pace can help reduce fatigue, ease depression, and support a healthy body weight. Whether it’s on a footpath, along the beach, or on a treadmill at the local gym, Movember encourages men to embrace the simplicity of walking for its wide-reaching benefits for mental and physical well-being. In addition, studies have also shown that men who engage in regular exercise have a lower risk of developing prostate cancer, especially aggressive forms of the disease. Urologist, Dr Michael Johnson recently explained in the John Hopkins Medicine journal that \"most likely, it's not just the exercise that counts - it's the subsequent weight loss that also makes a difference. “Studies have linked obesity with particularly aggressive forms of prostate cancer.\" Furthermore, a study from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found that men who exercised vigorously for three or more hours per week had a 61% reduction in the risk of prostate-specific death compared to those who exercised for less than one hour per week. These studies highlight the importance of regular physical activity or exercise as a vital measure to help reduce the risk of certain cancer-related deaths. In summary, while growing moustaches is a hallmark of the campaign, Movember also champions physical activity through initiatives like Move for Movember. Exercise New Zealand supports this focus, highlighting the role of regular exercise in reducing cancer risks and improving mental health. With research showing that mental well-being is a key reason men engage in physical activity, Movember creates space for open conversations and physical activity, reinforcing the benefits of an active lifestyle for both mental and physical health. Exercise New Zealand is encouraging all men across Aotearoa to prioritise their health this Movember by incorporating regular physical activity into their routines. 9th July 2024 - [ExerciseNZ invites entries for 2024 New Zealand Exercise Industry Awards](/news/exercisenz-invites-entries-for-2024-new-zealand-exercise-industry-awards) 27th June 2024 - [Myzone spotlights its global efforts in championing physical activity policies](/news/myzone-spotlights-its-global-efforts-in-championing-physical-activity-policies) 15th December 2023 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie contributes at World Health Organization meeting](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-contributes-at-world-health-organisation-meeting) 26th May 2023 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie critical of New Zealand Government’s focus on elite sport spending](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-critical-of-new-zealand-governments-focus-on-elite-sport-spending) 25th May 2023 - [Study suggests major sporting events fail to inspire mass physical activity](/news/study-suggests-major-sporting-events-fail-to-inspire-mass-physical-activity) 13th April 2023 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie at the formation of new global organisation World Active](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-at-the-formation-of-new-global-organisation-world-active) 17th March 2023 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie to chair IHRSA world exercise event in San Diego](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-to-chair-global-chair-world-exercise-event-in-san-diego) 21st February 2023 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie appointed to IHRSA Board of Directors](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-appointed-to-ihrsa-board-of-directors) 28th December 2022 - [ExerciseNZ survey shows New Zealand’s fitness industry has bounced back](/news/exercisenz-survey-shows-new-zealands-fitness-industry-has-bounces-back) 2nd November 2022 - [ExerciseNZ highlight why staying physically active will reduce cognitive decline](/news/exercisenz-highlight-why-staying-physically-active-will-reduce-cognitive-decline) 23rd September 2022 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie says exercising for mental health is ‘critical’](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-says-exercising-for-mental-health-is-critical) 19th August 2022 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie calls for New Zealand Government to deliver clear messages on the benefits of activity](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-calls-for-new-zealand-government-and-medical-professionals-to-deliver-clear-messages-on-the-benefits-of-activity) 30th November 2021 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie welcomes latest research advising longer lives are tied to physical activity](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-welcomes-latest-research-advising-longer-lives-are-tied-to-physical-activity) 16th September 2021 - [ExerciseNZ’s Richard Beddie highlights that gyms and fitness centres are part of the COVID solution](/news/exercisenzs-richard-beddie-highlights-that-gyms-and-fitness-centres-part-of-the-covid-solution) 7th November 2018 - [ESSA supports 2018 Movember Movement campaign to improve men’s health and wellness](/news/essa-supports-2018-movember-movement-campaign-to-improve-mens-health-and-wellness) 12th June 2018 - [Health and wellbeing of FIFO workers not overlooked during Men’s Health Week](/news/health-and-wellbeing-of-fifo-workers-not-overlooked-this-mens-health-week) 12th November 2012 - [iconnnect360 and Ezypay get hairy for Movember](/news/iconnnect360-and-ezypay-get-hairy-for-movember) 21st July 2010 - [Gwinganna Retreat launches Men’s health program](/news/gwinganna-retreat-launches-mens-health-program) Support our industry news service We hope that you value the news that we publish so while you're here can we ask for your support?
