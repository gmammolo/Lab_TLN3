  "text": "1 hour ago Kathryn Pinkston , JACKSON, Tenn. — The Jackson-Madison County Regional Health Department hosted its ‘Fight Flu Round 2’ event Thursday.\nThe event provided free flu vaccines to the public. It’s important to get vaccinated before flu season starts because it takes a couple weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body. Nationally, 7.5 million illnesses and 6,300 deaths could be prevented annually if more people chose to get a flu vaccine.\n“Getting your flu shot now or soon, in the next week or so, is going to have you protected by the time thanksgiving rolls around and we really do want to get protected before the holidays come. It’s gonna help prevent the spread of flu at all those holiday gatherings,” said Ginger Rowsey, public information officer for JMCRH.\nThe flu vaccine is safe and effective and can prevent against the most common types of circulating flu viruses and the flu’s worst symptoms.\nFor more news in the Jackson area, click here .\nCategories : Local News , Madison County , News Share this...\nemail Print Facebook Twitter Linkedin Related Posts Cafe stirs up attention with specialty 'Camel Bite' drink '1000-Lb Sisters' star appears back in Crockett County court, has case reset FHU students choose 2024 Homecoming Court",
