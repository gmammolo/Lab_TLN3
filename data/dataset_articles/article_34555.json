  "text": "In the world of zero-calorie sweeteners, Erythritol and Stevia shine as top choices for those looking to sweeten their life without the calories and artificial ingredients. The choice between them isn't just about satisfying a sweet tooth—it's about fitting into a lifestyle that values health without sacrificing flavor.\nSo what sets these sweeteners apart? Let’s explore and uncover the truth about Erythritol vs Stevia.\nWhat is Erythritol?\nErythritol is a natural sweetener sugar alternative made from fermented fructose found in some fruits. Erythritol is 70% as sweet as sugar. Because Erythritol is not very sweet, it is used in higher concentrations. According to The Mayo Clinic, these concentrations can be almost 1,000 times the levels naturally found.\nZero Calories, less Sugary Taste\nAccording to Health Line, Erythritol does not spike blood sugar, has zero calories, and is fine to eat for most people in moderation.\nWhat is Stevia?\nStevia, or steviol glycosides, is derived from the Stevia Rebaudiana plant in South America and has been used for hundreds of years. The Stevia plant is 200-400 times sweeter than processed sugar and has many health benefits. Because of the extremely sweet taste, very little is needed to enhance the flavors of your foods and drinks.\nSugary Taste AND Zero Calories!\nStevia sweetener has zero calories, can be great for those with diabetes, helps people manage their weight, or for those who want to make healthier choices in their everyday diet.\nSugar Substitutes: Erythritol vs Stevia\nWhen enhancing the flavor of food and drinks with fewer calories, the choice of sweetener plays a pivotal role. Erythritol and Stevia, both derived from natural sources, have emerged as favored alternatives to traditional sugar. For your sweetener choice, savvy shoppers should weigh several factors including:\n- Taste\n- Side effects\nSweet Taste Test\nConsidering the taste of both Stevia and Erythritol is fundamental for consumers. Erythritol is 70% as sweet as sugar while Stevia is200-400 times sweeter than regular sugar. This means you will need to use a lot more Erythritol than Stevia to satisfy your sweet tooth. Where a sprinkle of Stevia may satisfy your craving, spoonfuls of Erythritol will be necessary to match the taste of Stevia.\nWhat’s Better for Blood Sugar Control?\nWhile both Erythritol and Stevia have zero calories, Stevia is associated with more health benefits such as lowering blood pressure and fewer potential side effects. Erythritol can cause nausea and digestive issues for some people while Stevia is known to have no harmful impact on your gut.\nAlternative Sweetener Choices\nWondering if Erythritol and Stevia are the sole stars of the alternative sweetness show? Let's explore other options and their health facts!\nSplenda\nSplenda is one of the most popular sucralose sweeteners. While this zero alorie sweetener may be a good alternative to table sugar in some cases, Splenda can spike blood sugar levels and insulin levels for some people.\nAspartame\nAspartame is an artificial zero calorie sweetener used commonly in soft drinks and food since the 1970s. While there have been many studies about the risks of Aspartame, it is currently FDA-approved in the United States.\nWhy Do We Choose Stevia?\nAt True Lemon, we pride ourselves on using clean, non-GMO, gluten-free, and vegan-friendly ingredients.
