  "text": "At Last, a Nasal Epinephrine Spray This summer, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) fast-tracked approval of the [first-in-its-class nasal epinephrine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-nasal-spray-treatment-anaphylaxis) (neffy). It’s a very welcome addition to our [anaphylaxis](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/135065-overview) treatment armamentarium. In healthy volunteers, neffy achieved similar serum epinephrine levels, rises in blood pressure, and pulse compared with IM epinephrine. The Need for Neffy It was just a few days ago that I saw a new patient with fire ant anaphylaxis. The last time he tried to use an injectable epinephrine pen, he made two mistakes. First, he placed the wrong end against his thigh, and when it did not inject, he depressed it with his thumb — in other words, he injected his thumb with epinephrine. Of course, that cannot happen with neffy. I recall a few years ago, a child experienced anaphylaxis but the parent was hesitant to administer the EAI (epinephrine autoinjector). The parent drove to the emergency room but was delayed by traffic, and by the time they reached the ER, the patient had suffered a respiratory arrest and passed away. Patients are not the only ones who are hesitant to administer epinephrine. Some clinicians do not treat anaphylaxis appropriately. As an allergist, I see patients after-the-fact for diagnosis and management. Patients often tell me of systemic allergic reactions treated with IV antihistamines/corticosteroids and even sometimes with nebulized beta agonists, but not epinephrine. My opinion is that it’s not just needle [phobia](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/290854-overview). As I mentioned, in my Medscape commentary [“Injectable Epinephrine: An Epidemic of Misuse,”](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/838198) I believe it’s due to a misunderstanding of the guidelines and a sense that epinephrine is a potent medication to be used sparingly. Clinicians and patients must understand that epinephrine is a naturally occurring hormone and administration leads to serum levels seen under other natural circumstances (eg, stress — the fight-or-flight surge). The aforementioned article also includes a patient handout, “Don’t Fear Epinephrine,” which I encourage you to read and distribute. The potential benefits of neffy are clear: - It should overcome fear of injection ergo being more likely to be used, and used earlier, by both patient/family member and clinicians. - It’s easier to carry than many larger devices (though not the AUVI-Q). - It cannot be injected incorrectly. - Expiration is 8 months longer than the EAI. - There are no pharmacist substitutions (as there is no equivalent device). Potential Problems With Neffy and Some Suggested Solutions As promising and beneficial as it is, I wonder about a few training issues. In the office, patients can be trained with a (reusable) injectable epinephrine trainer but not with a nasal spray device trainer in the office (an important alternative is a small model of a nose in the office for patient education). A training device should also be included in the neffy prescription, as with the EAI.",
