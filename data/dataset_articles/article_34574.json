  "text": "GREENVILLE, Pitt County — A new traffic signal could help prevent pedestrian crashes. NCDOT wants to bring to Greenville in the area of 10th Street near ECU. [That's where a car hit two people just this week.](https://wcti12.com/news/local/two-pedestrians-hit-by-car-in-greenville-investigation-underway#) News 12 spent the day talking with students and officials about crosswalk safety. ECU students use these crosswalks everyday with systems already in place to help them cross streets safely. Some think it's not enough, but change is already on the way. \"I do think they need to either police it more or put in different signs, I'm not really sure,\" said ECU Senior BraddockRhodenhiser. On Monday, a car hit two women while they crossed 10th Street, next to ECU's campus. Both were taken to ECU Health Medical, and one has since been released. It's a pattern students have become familiar with and even experienced themselves. Especially on 10th, crossing the crosswalk, I've almost been hit multiple times, and I think they need to change something to do with that because either people don't see the flashing lights or people don't think to slow down. Now, change is coming. Due to the numerous accidents involving pedestrians over the years NCDOT has decided to step in with a new traffic signal. It's called the Hawk System. \"The vehicles aren't stopping like they're supposed to with the RFB systems...we submitted a request in September of 2023 for the Hawk System,\" said Division Traffic Engineer, Jim Evans. This new system works a bit differently...when the button is pressed, drivers will see a flashing yellow light warning drivers to slow down. Then, the light turns a solid yellow, which means prepare to stop. Lastly, the light turns a solid red. That's when pedestrians can cross the street as a countdown starts. Near the end, the light will start flashing red. There's going to be some education about this once we get it installed in the area, I've already brought it up to the Greenville Task Force and ECU that we're going to have to get some information out on how the system works because it works different than a signal. Evans tells us they are waiting for approval for design plans but hopes construction will start next August.",
