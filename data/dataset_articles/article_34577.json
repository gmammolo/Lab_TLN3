  "text": "AQI shows improvement in city, better than last year The air quality index (AQI) in the industrial city, as compared to last year, has shown a considerable improvement. Still, people are experiencing ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ air quality conditions. The data taken for the first seven days of November 2024 shows there has been much improvement in the quality of air as compared to 2023, which remained “poor” for all seven days, starting from November 1-7. While this year in November, the conditions remained ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ except for ‘very poor’ on November 2, after the bursting of crackers on Diwali on November 1. On other days, the air quality index recorded included 204 on November 1, 339 on November 2, 108 on November 3, 184 on November 4, 155 on November 5, 210 on November 6 and 173 on Thursday. While last year, the AQI was 245 on November 1, 219 on November 2, 228 on November 3, 289 on November 4, 243 on November 5, 282 on November 6 and 239 on November 7. Throughout the first week of November 2023, the AQI was ‘poor’. There is slight improvement in the air quality as compared to last year may be due to strict action against farm fires or awareness drives. In 2023, it rained in October which cleared the skies, this time there are no rains so far since October, still improved conditions are witnessed as far as the AQI is concerned.",
