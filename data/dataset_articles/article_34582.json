  "text": "As daylight hours shorten and temperatures drop into the 40s and 50s, students may feel more than just a chill. For some, these environmental shifts bring an extra set of challenges — a battle with seasonal depression.\nIn winter months, it’s normal to crave warmer weather and feel more tired than usual, but if you begin to withdraw from activities, experience prolonged sadness or notice changes in your sleep and appetite, you may be dealing with seasonal depression.\n\"About 5% of Americans develop full-blown winter-onset depression each year, but the risk is considerably higher among today's college students,\" said University of Kansas psychology professor Dr. Stephen Ilardi.\nWhat is seasonal depression?\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, seasonal depression, also known as Seasonal Affective Disorder, is “a type of depression characterized by a recurrent seasonal pattern, with symptoms lasting about 4−5 months out of the year.”\nDr. Ilardi said sunlight intake levels can also be a large contributor to seasonal depression.\n\"Reduced sunlight during the short, cloudy days of winter disrupts our body clocks and serotonin levels,\" Dr. Ilardi said.\nA lack of sunlight can cause serotonin levels to drop, which can lead to feelings of sadness, lethargy and irritability. It can also disrupt the body's natural production of the sleep chemical melatonin, which affects sleep quality.\nSigns of a problem\nKU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) clinician Stefany Ortiz said that students struggling with seasonal depression “may begin to isolate themselves from others, oversleep, skip classes and cancel plans.”\nIf you or someone you know is showing symptoms of seasonal depression, it may be beneficial to talk to a health care provider or a mental health professional.\nCommon signs include experiencing two weeks or more of:\nFeelings of sadness or hopelessness.\nSocial withdrawal.\nLow energy levels.\nChanges in sleep pattern.\nSlower speech and movement.\nChanges in appetite.\nStruggling to complete daily tasks.\nManaging symptoms\nHere are some ways that students can manage their seasonal depression and make it through the cold, winter months.\n\"The best self-help step is usually to start getting 30 minutes each day of exposure to outdoor sunlight — or to a therapeutic light box that can simulate sunlight,\" Dr. Ilardi said.\nLight therapy is a common treatment for seasonal depression because it can promote serotonin production in the brain, and help regulate the body's circadian rhythm. Light therapy lamps should have an intensity of at least 10,000 lux for best results.\nSticking to a routine can also be helpful. \"Be sure to engage in good self-care, setting aside enough time for: regular exercise, in-person social connections, nutritious meals and healthy sleep,\" Dr. Ilardi said.\nExercising releases endorphins and other feel-good chemicals in the brain, which can boost mood and energy. Similar chemicals are released when spending time with friends and loved ones. Isolation and inactivity can make depression symptoms worse.\nPrioritizing nutritious meals and eight hours of sleep per night can stabilize the body’s energy levels and ensure good health. Not getting enough sleep can increase stress hormones such as cortisol, which can worsen depression symptoms and increase reactivity to negative emotions and stress.\nAsk for support\nIf you’re struggling with seasonal depression symptoms, CAPS Access Clinician Stefany Ortiz said asking for help is encouraged.\n“You’re not alone in your experience, and there are many resources and folks on campus who are ready to support you,” Ortiz said.\nKU students have access to mental health resources through CAPS. CAPS offers drop-in appointments, individual therapy sessions, workshops and peer listening. Information on CAPS services can be found on its website. Students can also access further counseling through the Telus Student Support Program, which offers free, 24/7 counseling.\nCounseling and Psychological Services is open from Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students can schedule an appointment through their website or by calling (785) 864-2277.",
