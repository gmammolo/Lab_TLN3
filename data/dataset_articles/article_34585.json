  "text": "Home / Avocado Nutrition / Avocado in a Keto Diet: An Ally for Keto\nEverything tastes better with avocado!\nAnd keto diet is no exception. If you have decided to follow a ketogenic diet, you should know that the avocado is a fruit you can include in your meals due to its healthy fat content. Avocados contain 5 g Monounsaturated Fat and 1 g Polyunsaturated Fat, making avocados great for a keto diet.\nA diet high in fat and low in carbohydrates (sugars) that causes the body to break down fat into molecules called ketones. Ketones circulate in the blood and become the main source of energy for many cells in the body. A ketogenic diet is used to treat some types of epilepsy and is being studied in the treatment of some types of cancer.\nSource: www.cancer.gov\nMore reasons to love avocados\nLuckily for all avocado lovers, this is possibly one of the best keto foods, as one third provides 8grams of total fat and 6 grams of healthy fats and only 4grams of carbohydrates; besides being a good source of fiber, it is a nutrient-dense fruit. To top it off, avocados in a keto diet can be eaten alone or included in a wide variety of dishes such as salads, soups, desserts, sauces, and the famous guacamole.\nThe predominant fat in an avocado is unsaturated, making it a great substitute for foods high in saturated fat such as butter and other full-fat spreads. Another of its qualities (yes, there are even more), is that we can find this fruit throughout the year, so you can include avocados in a keto diet for as long as you decide to follow the diet. Isn’t it wonderful?\nRemember, always consult a specialist when choosing a new diet plan.",
