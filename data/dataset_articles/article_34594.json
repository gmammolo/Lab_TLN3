  "text": "Nova Scotia Health has made changes to parking and the main entrance of the QEII Halifax Infirmary. [Learn more.](/locations-and-facilities/halifax-infirmary)\nEastern Kings Memorial Health Foundation Hand-to-Hand to Help fund makes “big impact” by providing financial help for patients undergoing cancer treatment\nIn 2004, the EKM Health Foundation and the Rotary Club of Wolfville both agreed it was important to reinvest in the community by providing grants to some of its most vulnerable citizens – those attempting to deal with the pain, anxiety and expense associated with cancer.\nThe Hand-to-Hand to Help fund is separate from the Foundation’s regular grants program and is designed to complement existing health care processes by providing relief where it is most needed.\nWhile the Foundation manages the monies for this fund, Valley Regional Hospital’s Cancer Care Patient Navigator is the “on the ground” presence who oversees the disbursal of the funds to those patients and families who are most in need.\n“That’s the nice thing about Nova Scotia. It’s community helping community,” said Dianna Hutt, cancer patient navigator, speaking about the Hand-to-Hand to Help fund. The fund provides patients and families from Greenwich to Avonport with financial help for expenses related to their cancer treatment.\n“Travel is probably the most common item,” said Hutt, who notes that patients who require radiation therapy need to travel to Halifax. The fund also supports other items as needed, including medications or uninsured items that can help with cancer treatments. Hutt noted that a patient who had undergone treatment was recently given funding to cover the cost of a lymphedema sleeve to reduce swelling in her arm, giving her regained use of the arm.\nHutt said patients and families are pleasantly shocked when she tells them the Hand-to-Hand to Help fund can help with expenses.\n“We tell patients about the travel program through the provincial government, which is accessible to families with an income of under $35,000. However, many families are over that amount but still benefit from financial help. When we can give them a $300 gas card, for instance, it makes a big impact.”\n“We’re very blessed because we do have such community support,” said Hutt. “It’s really nice to see community coming together to help support those who are going through a rough time.”\nCongratulations to the EKM Health Foundation on reaching a major fundraising milestone; since 1997, the Foundation has provided $4-million in support to health-related charitable organizations and initiatives in the communities of Eastern Kings County.\nNova Scotia Health thanks the EKM Health Foundation for their generous donations to support programs within our facilities, as well as the countless donations they’ve made to community groups helping to enable healthy people, healthy communities, for generations.",
