[Learn more.](/locations-and-facilities/halifax-infirmary)\nCelebrating Medical Radiation Technologist (MRT) Week: Meet some of Nova Scotia Health’s dedicated MRTs\nNovember 3 to 9 marks Medical Radiation Technologist’ Week.\nMedical Radiation Technologists (MRTs) play an essential role in patient care. These technologists work across the province providing magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs), X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasounds and more. Their work ensures that physicians have the detailed images of bones, tissues, and organs that are needed, to support diagnoses and treatments. Learn about the path to becoming an MRT.\nMeet Jenna, Kelsey, Caitlin and Katie, four of Nova Scotia Health’s MRT and learn more about how they are serving their communities.\nJenna Kaizer: Connecting health and technology\nFor 13 years, Jenna Kaizer has been working across multiple specialties, including CT scans and angiography (a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels) at Valley Regional Hospital.\n\"We work closely with radiologists, and the images we capture can reveal so much about what’s going on inside the body.\"\nNo two days are never the same for Kaizer. With the fast pace and high pressure involved in her work, she uses her years of experience to ensure the best possible imaging, so that physicians can get the most accurate diagnosis.\n“Hospitals can be overwhelming, and I enjoy making the experience as smooth and comforting as possible.”\nKelsey Hancock: Multi-tasking for better outcomes\nKelsey Handcock, based at Colchester East Hants Health Centre (CEHHC) has a diverse skill set. She can deliver many different types of diagnostic imaging services. She works primarily to provide patients with X-rays, CT scans, and more recently, mammography (an X-ray image of the breast).\nHandcock knew she wanted a career that was both dynamic and impactful, which is why she chose to enter the Radiological Technologist program at Dalhousie University. She enjoys providing the best patient care possible and the versatility she experiences in her role every day.\n“The best part of my job is seeing the positive difference we can make in a patient’s life,” says Handcock, “Whether we’re doing an urgent CT to assess a stroke or a mammogram to help diagnose breast cancer, we contribute to both the diagnosis and the treatment plan.”\nCaitlin Wittenberg: Commitment to excellence\nAfter completing an Advanced Diploma in Medical Radiation Technology in Ontario, Caitlin made to move to Kentville and has spent the last 11 years working at Valley Regional Hospital. She specializes in CT, general X-rays and interventional radiography.), which is when images are collected to guide a procedure as it is being completed).\nCaitlin emphasizes that MRTs play a crucial role in the healthcare system by providing detailed images to assist in accurate diagnoses.\n“The thing I enjoy most about my job is being a vital role in a patient’s healthcare journey,” she says. “It is rewarding knowing how important it is for us to do our job well, and how my knowledge and skills can impact the next steps in diagnosis or treatment.”\nKatie Cleveland: Collaborating for patient care\nKatie Cleveland completed her a Bachelor of Applied Sciences in Radiography degree, and now works at Valley Regional Hospital focusing on X-rays.\nAs an MRT, Cleveland knows that she is among the critical team members in the circle of care for patients. She provides imaging in the emergency department, runs a portable X-ray machine to take images at the bedside, and provides imaging in the operating room.\n“I love the collaborative teamwork that goes into my job as an MRT,” she says. “It is a challenging environment that involves many people working together to reach a diagnosis and help improve patients’ health.”",
