All proceeds from the event … POTSDAM – During the month of October, Knight & Associates Physical Therapy in Potsdam held a fundraiser to help support National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. All proceeds from the event were donated to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. Breast cancer is a terrible disease that affects 1 in 8 women in their lifetime. It is estimated that 168,000 women in the US alone are living with metastatic breast cancer today, as mentioned on the organization’s web site. This foundation is nationally recognized to support community programs for the detection, treatment , patient and family support. This year, the clinic and the actively involved local community members raised $1,389 to help support this organization. The money raised will continue to help provide services for those in need and to help fund research to prevent and find the cure for breast cancer. Knight & Associates Physical Therapy’s fundraising dollars from the event were tripled with the backing of their generous partner, Bank of America, raising the total contribution to $4,167. \"Our Clinic was very proud to hold this month-long event. This year, we have also supported a fundraiser for one of our local non-profits, Helping Hands, and hosted a Blood Drive. It's all about giving back and changing lives,” stated Michael Williams of Knight & Associates Physical Therapy.",
