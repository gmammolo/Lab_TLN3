  "text": "MARQUETTE, Mich. (WLUC) - The new UP Health Systems - Marquette (UPHS) building opened officially in September, and the Lake Superior Community Partnership celebrated with a ribbon cutting on Thursday afternoon. The new medical office building is home to the Outpatient Behavioral Health Services, the UP Regional Blood Center and the UP Bariatric Institute, all of which were part of the old campus. Tonya Darner, UPHS - Marquette CEO, said there was no room in the current campus, so they revitalized an old building. “We had to find another location to be able to house the services and we did not have the space on the current hospital campus, and this space was available, and we were glad to be able to use a property that was just sitting vacant and make it into this beautiful complex that it is today,” Darner said. Darner says the switch between buildings only saw a service break of one to two days. Darner says they’re hoping the easy access to the campus will increase blood donations at the UP Regional Blood Center and visitors at the UP Bariatric Institute and Outpatient Behavioral Health Services.
