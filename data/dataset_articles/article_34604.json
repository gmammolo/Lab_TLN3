  "text": "Strengthening Africa CDC Epidemiology Training Programme in Addis Ababa\nAfrica CDC has completed the initial classroom phase of its intensive epidemiology training programme in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with significant support from ECDC. The first phase, which ran from 29 July to 1 November 2024, marked the beginning of a comprehensive two-year-long programme designed to strengthen Africa’s epidemic preparedness by equipping fellows with advanced epidemiology skills.\nThe African Epidemic Service (AES) programme, established by Africa CDC, has become a cornerstone of the public health workforce development strategy. With three tracks – Epidemiology, Laboratory Leadership, and Public Health Informatics – the AES addresses Africa’s needs in key areas of epidemic response. The recently completed epidemiology track ran with 10 fellows, who will continue hands-on training in various host sites across Africa for the next nine months.\nThroughout the programme, ECDC provided essential support in developing the AES curriculum, while also delivering French translations and interpretation services for training materials. ECDC’s contributions enabled knowledge-sharing, creating a rich learning environment for the participants.\nThe programme’s first phase consisted of a 14-week agenda, which included sessions on topics such as public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, public health surveillance, outbreak investigation, and health economics. The successful completion of the first phase of the epidemiology training marks another step towards strengthening the continent’s capacity to manage infectious disease threats effectively.\nBackground\nThe Africa CDC – ECDC Partnership programme is a four-year capacity-building project launched in January 2021 and funded by the European Commission’s DG for International Partnerships. The project is designed to support Africa CDC’s capacity to monitor and respond to health threats across the continent, facilitating harmonised disease surveillance and sharing best practices with the EU in disease intelligence and emergency response.\nAfrica CDC\nAfrica CDC strengthens the capacity and capability of Africa’s public health institutions as well as partnerships to detect and respond quickly and effectively to disease threats and outbreaks, based on data-driven interventions and programmes.\n[\n](/en/about-ecdc/partners-and-networks/international-cooperation/africa-cdc-ecdc-partnership)\nAfrica CDC – ECDC Partnership\nECDC is collaborating with Africa CDC to strengthen the capacities of Africa CDC in preparedness and response to health threats.\nRead more[\n](/en/about-us/who-we-work/international-activities)\nInternational cooperation\nECDC cooperates with international partners, such as the World Health Organization and the centres for disease control and prevention (CDCs) across the globe.",
