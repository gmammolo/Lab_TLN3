  "text": "IOWA CITY, Iowa (KCRG) - A nonprofit in Iowa City that helps people experiencing homelessness will have a renovated, more accessible shelter ready for this winter.\nShelter House started construction on its Emergency Shelter late this summer. Director of Development and Communications Christine Hayes says the 70-bed space will greatly improve accessibility for those seeking shelter. “We had a vestibule that was really hard to get through, particularly for folks who have mobility impairment,” says Hayes. “Changing the sight lines in the lobby so that way you can always see what’s going on and help out if someone is having a crisis. We have a lot of folks at shelter who have mental and physical health concerns.”\nIt also include more rooms dedicated to sheltering families together. “It it allows something that resembles stability when a family is in crisis. I mean, it’s certainly still a shelter, right? Like there’s no way to make a shelter easy or to make a shelter feel like home. But it sure is nice to have a space for, to keep families together,” says Hayes.\nHayes says the need for shelter is up across the board, especially after a law that took effect last year in Iowa City allowing landlords to turn away renters who receive assistance through the federal housing choice voucher program. “It’s taking about three times as long to get people out of shelter and into housing, and we have no data points other than that change to attribute it to,” says Hayes.\nShelter House is also preparing for a significant fundraiser, celebrating 40 years of service. The nonprofit is hosting a 40th Anniversary Gala on Thursday, November 14, at Hancher Auditorium. The event will feature “music, food and drinks, an auction, a game of heads & tails, and a program acknowledging our past and looking to the future.”\nAll the funds raised for the event will go toward retiring the commercial debt on The 501 Project, aka 501 Southgate.\nShelter House also currently has several donors matching financial contributions to the 40th anniversary campaign up to $52,000.
