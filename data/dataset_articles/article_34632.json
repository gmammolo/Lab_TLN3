We've attached links in our news story with more details. TOPICS:\nAlliant Energy Gas safety Homeowners Natural gas Gas leak Carbon monoxide Winter safety Digging incidents CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Wintertime is just around the corner here in eastern Iowa and as temperatures continue to cool off, that means more heat -- and natural gas -- for your home. That also means an increased risk of a gas leak.\nRight now, Alliant Energy is sharing safety tips with homeowners to help them stay safe during and from breaking the bank. There are several warning signs that could suggest a gas leak, including:\nThe smell of rotten eggs. A hissing or whistling noise near a gas appliance. Blowing dirt, bubbling water, or discolored vegetation in what is supposed to be a green area. Alliant Energy Communications Specialist II, Chris Caporale, said there are several things you can do to help prevent this from happening.\n\"There's a few things obviously, making sure your furnace is operating as efficiently as possible,\" Caporale said. \"Making sure the filters are changed and doing annual tune-ups or something like that, making sure all your windows are sealed preventing drafts, smart thermostats are another tool that are possible to help control the temperature in the home.\" There are several other steps you can take to help protect you and your home. You can find that list below:\nInstall carbon monoxide and natural gas detectors Detectors help identify odorless threats like carbon monoxide and are especially important for those with a known loss of smell. Additionally, certain soil conditions can strip the rotten egg odorant out of natural gas, making it more challenging to detect without proper equipment. If your natural gas detector goes off, move quickly to a safe location and call Alliant Energy at 1-800-255-4268 .\nPrevent snow and ice from blocking gas vents Once winter arrives, snow and ice can damage gas meters and pipes. Use a broom to keep gas service equipment clear. You must clear vents for gas appliances following a major snow or ice storm to enable proper venting and prevent carbon monoxide accumulation.\nDig safely In addition to increased potential gas and carbon monoxide risks when the weather turns cooler, there’s also an increased risk of gas pipeline damage as homeowners rush to finish yardwork. Digging incidents are the most common cause of underground natural gas leaks. If you plan to dig, including constructing a fire pit, visit call811.com at least three days ahead of time. This will initiate a free process for utilities to locate and mark underground lines so you can dig safely.\nEven minor damage to a gas pipeline such as nicks, scratches, cuts, scrapes, dents and gouges can result in pipeline failure or a major incident in the future if not properly assessed. Call Alliant Energy at 1-800-ALLIANT if your digging equipment or tools contact underground pipelines.\nFinally, never place a fire pit above a buried line. If the fire gets too hot, it could cause the gas pipeline below to leak or melt.\nYou can find the full list of gas safety tips by visiting the Alliant Energy homepage .\nStay Connected Like Us Follow Us sbg-envelope\nNewsletter Sign up /sign-up\n© 2024 Sinclair, Inc.
