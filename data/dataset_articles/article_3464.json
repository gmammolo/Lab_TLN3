  "text": "Police are encouraging people to apply to become voluntary special constables, to help community policing.\nThe special constables to be employed around Greater Manchester will volunteer a minimum 16 hours of their time per month.\nTraining to be a special constable takes place over 10 to 12 weekends across a three-month period, and Personal Safety Training over eight consecutive weekdays.\nA spokesman for the police said: “GMP are looking for long-term Special Constables to join our current establishment, who are committed, motivated, flexible, have good interpersonal skills, as well as the ability to think on their feet in challenging situations.\n“We welcome individuals from all walks of life and backgrounds.\n“Being a special constable allows you to bring along and transfer relevant skills, experience, and knowledge from your day job and/or previous life experience and give something back to the communities of Greater Manchester.”\nThroughout November, special constables across the region have volunteered nearly 5,000 hours to policing duties.\nNow, the force is looking for more volunteers.\nThe Special Constabulary consists of volunteer police officers who give up some of their spare time to assist with the policing of their community and increase the effectiveness of local police initiatives.\nSpecial constables are a vital part of the UK police service, helping to divert crime and interacting with the diverse communities that they serve.\nGreater Manchester Police believe that ‘specials’ are an integral part of the police family, and by working alongside regular police officers and teams, they provide a flexible, visible, responsive, and committed resource.\nCrime Bolton",
