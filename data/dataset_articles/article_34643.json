  "text": "Humane Fort Wayne helps West Virginia animal shelter that rescued 150 dogs from hoarding case FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WPTA) - Humane Fort Wayne recently helped a West Virginia animal shelter after a planned rescue of 10 chihuahuas led to the recovery of nearly 150 dogs from a West Virginia home in late October. In West Virginia, the Humane Society of Parkersburg shares that it rescued and recovered 146 dogs from a West Virginia home on Wednesday, October 30, after a neighbor left a tip, notifying them that there were at least 10 chihuahuas inside the house. “Our humane officers went there... we knew there was probably more than 10. We were not expecting 146,” said the animal shelter’s manager Samantha Tannous. “Things just got out of hand,” added the animal shelter’s executive director, Gary McIntyre. BACKGROUND: [Planned rescue of 10 chihuahuas leads to recovery of nearly 150 dogs](https://www.21alivenews.com/2024/11/03/planned-rescue-10-chihuahuas-leads-recovery-nearly-150-dogs/) Following the rescue and recovery efforts of the West Virginia animal shelter, Best Friends Animal Society, an animal welfare organization, reached out to Humane Fort Wayne asking for help. On Saturday, November 3, Humane Fort Wayne says it took in the emergency transport of 10 of the dogs rescued and recovered by the West Virginia animal shelter, Over the weekend, each dog was given a bath and provided a clean kennel, thanks to the efforts of Humane Fort Wayne staff and volunteers. After being evaluated by Humane Fort Wayne’s behavior team, having spay/neuter surgeries done, and receiving all necessary medical care, Humane Fort Wayne says most of the dogs were made available for adoption. As of Thursday, seven of the 10 dogs have been adopted. Three dogs are not yet available for adoption, due to needing further evaluation.
