(WVIR) - Albemarle County is celebrating an achievement award for its Human Services Alternative Response Team, or HART.\nThe Achievement award from the Virginia Association of Counties recognizes excellence in local government programs across the state.\nAlbemarle County launched HART to help police and fire and rescue be better equipped to handle behavioral and mental health emergencies.\n“We always hope that we are going to do the right thing and do it well. but to be rewarded and have the community respond so positively and so quickly is really unexpected and really warms the hearts of the folks who are on that team,” said Chief Human Services Officer, Kaki Dimock.\nSince its start, HART has served about 550 people in the community. Albemarle County was one of 45 recipients of the award.\nDo you have a story idea? Send us your news tip here .\nCopyright 2024 WVIR. All rights reserved.",
