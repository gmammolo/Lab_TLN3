  "text": "But electric fans were associated with harm in a hot and dry setting In the absence of air conditioning, simple measures proved effective at lowering heat-induced cardiac strain in older people.\nRandomized crossover studies showed that electric fans and skin wetting both worked better than no cooling in a hot and humid environment -- and in people with or without coronary artery disease (CAD) -- to reduce the mean change from baseline to hour 3 in rate-pressure product (heart rate multiplied by systolic blood pressure):\nElectric fan: -517 bpm x mm Hg (P=0.004)\nSkin wetting: -468 bpm x mm Hg (P=0.01)\nFan use plus skin wetting: -750 bpm x mm Hg (P<0.001)\nIn a very hot and dry environment, however, there was harm observed with fan use. Heat-induced cardiac strain actually increased with fan use relative to controls (+2,139 bpm x mm Hg) and these tests had to be stopped early after 43% of participants started feeling unwell, had a high heart rate, or had abnormal findings on electrocardiography. Notably, this set of experiments was only conducted in people without CAD.\nIn contrast, skin wetting did manage to reduce the cardiac strain in the very hot and dry environment (-478 bpm x mm Hg), CAD or not, reported Ollie Jay, PhD, of University of Sydney in Australia, and colleagues in a brief correspondence in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\"Health hazards from extreme heat are becoming increasingly common because of climate change. Older adults, especially those with heart disease, are at greater risk due to the…\nNicole Lou",
