  "text": "Mid-Columbia Community Action Council (MCCAC) has released its 2023 Annual Report, highlighting substantial achievements in addressing housing instability across Hood River, Wasco, and Sherman counties. \"In 2023, MCCAC made significant strides in expanding our impact, supporting over 3,000 community members through more than $4.4 million in program services and client assistance,\" said Kenny LaPoint, Executive Director of MCCAC. \"The opening of The Annex Transitional Housing and Shelter facility in The Dalles marked a major milestone in our efforts to address houselessness in the region.\" Key achievements from 2023 include: • 149 individuals successfully transitioned from houselessness into long-term, stable housing • 200 community members at risk of eviction maintained their housing • 17,350 nights of shelter were provided across three counties • 2,140 individuals received utility assistance services The report highlights MCCAC's commitment to equity and inclusion, with 51% of utility assistance and weatherization program participants identifying as Native, Latinx, or BIPOC community members. The organization also strengthened its community partnerships, engaging over 50 partner organizations through the Mid-Columbia Houseless Collaborative and through on-site partnerships at The Annex. Notable 2023 highlights included: • The opening of The Annex, providing over 50 transitional housing and shelter units • Construction progress on The Gloria Center, a multi-agency social service hub • Engagement of 150 community volunteers contributing 435 service hours • Distribution of $624,424 in utility assistance to help keep families warm and safe \"The Annex project not only provides crucial housing services but also contributed to the local economy, with 21 of the 24 contractors involved being local businesses, infusing nearly $2 million into our community,\" LaPoint noted. MCCAC emphasizes that the accomplishments and work of 2023 reflect their mission to build a better future through partnership and equity-centered programs that prevent and eliminate poverty and houselessness. The organization continues to focus on expanding services and strengthening community partnerships to address ongoing needs in the Mid-Columbia region.
