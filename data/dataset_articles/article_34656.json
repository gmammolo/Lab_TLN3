  "text": "(HealthDay News) — Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk classification improves prognostication with localized prostate cancer, according to a study published online Oct. 24 in JCO Precision Oncology .\nJonathan David Tward, MD, PhD, from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and colleagues developed a clinically usable risk grouping system using multimodal AI (MMAI) models to risk-stratify localized prostate cancer. The analysis included 9,787 patients with localized prostate cancer from eight phase 3 trials treated with radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and/or chemotherapy followed for a median 7.9 years.\nThe researchers found that according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categories, 30.4% of patients were low-risk, 25.5% intermediate-risk, and 44.1% high-risk. Based on MMAI risk classification, 43.5% of patients were low-risk, 34.6% intermediate-risk, and 21.8% high-risk, yielding reclassification of 1,039 patients (42.0%). The 10-year metastasis risks were comparable despite the MMAI low-risk group being larger than the NCCN low-risk group (1.7% for NCCN versus 3.2% for MMAI). For NCCN high-risk patients, the overall 10-year metastasis risk was 16.6%, with MMAI further stratifying this group into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk, with metastasis rates of 3.4, 8.2 and 26.3%, respectively.\n“This approach aims to prevent both overtreatment and undertreatment in localized prostate cancer, facilitating shared decision-making,” the authors write.\nSeveral authors disclosed ties to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.\nAbstract/Full Text",
