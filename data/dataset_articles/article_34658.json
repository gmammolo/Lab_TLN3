  "text": "This Pear Salad combines candied walnuts, mixed greens, fresh pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan cheese, drizzled with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. So fresh and flavor-packed, this salad is bound to become a new favorite.\nThis is one of our all-time favorite salads. This salad is quick and easy, even with the homemade dressing. It is a must-try for all pear lovers and a tasty blend of flavors and textures. I love to serve this salad with grilled chicken , baked cod , pan-fried pork chops , grilled shrimp , and even salmon patties .\nIngredient Notes and Substitutions Nuts : You can substitute pecans for the walnuts. Just follow the same directions for candying them. Balsamic vinegar : They sell white balsamic vinegar, which is more aesthetically pleasing on this salad. Salad greens : Use spring greens or mixed greens like arugula, baby spinach, baby greens Pears : You can use any kind of pear with this salad such as Bosc, Anjou, and Bartlett. Cranberries : Try dried cherries, apricots, and blueberries, and pomegranate ariels instead of the dried cranberries. They are all equally delicious. Parmesan cheese : You can substitute blue cheese or feta cheese. How to make Pear Salad Combine the walnuts, brown sugar, melted butter, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir to coat. Cover a small baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Spread the walnuts out in a single layer. Bake the walnuts at 300 degrees for about 20-25 minutes, flipping them halfway through baking. Let them cool before adding them to the salad.\nWhile the walnuts are baking, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, honey, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, and olive oil. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.\nIn a large serving bowl, add the mixed greens and candied walnuts. Slice the pears thinly and brush the flesh with lemon juice. Add the pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan. Drizzle with the balsamic vinaigrette and toss to coat. Serve promptly.\nPreparation Tips You can make the salad dressing up to 3 days in advance and store it in an airtight container in the fridge. Most grocery stores carry a prepackaged spring mix blend. This tender vegetation makes a fabulous salad, but watch your expiration dates as the leaves break down faster than a good, sturdy romaine or head of iceberg lettuce. Brush the sliced pears with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown before you are ready to serve. Recipe Variations Nuts : try pecans, almonds, or cashews, either candied or not Fruit : try dried cherries, dried apricots, dried blueberries, and pomegranate ariels instead of the dried cranberries, or substitute sliced apples for the pears. Cheese : try feta cheese, blue cheese, gorgonzola, or goat cheese. Meat : add crispy cooked chopped bacon, grilled chicken breasts , or smoked salmon. Storage This salad is best enjoyed after the vinaigrette is drizzled and tossed on the salad. That being said, store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge, but try to enjoy it as soon as possible.\nMore Salad Recipes Asian Cucumber Salad Asian Chopped Salad Grilled Chicken Salad Cucumber Tomato Salad German Cucumber salad Pear Salad with Walnuts and Parmesan Cheese This Pear Salad combines candied walnuts, mixed greens, fresh pears, dried cranberries, and shaved Parmesan cheese, all drizzled with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. 5 from 16 votes Print\nPin Rate Course: lunch, Salad, side Cuisine: American Prep Time: 15 minutes minutes Cook Time: 20 minutes minutes Servings: 6 Calories: 475 kcal Author: Beth Pierce Ingredients Candied Walnuts 1 cup walnuts 3/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon sea salt Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing 2 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon honey 1 garlic clove minced 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste Pear Salad 7 ounces mixed salad greens 2 ripe pears 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup dried cranberries 1/2 cup shaved parmesan Instructions Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
