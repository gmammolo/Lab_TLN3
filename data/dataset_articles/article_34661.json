  "text": "Cannabis legalization marks the dawn of easy access to regulated pot products. There are certain cities with a weed shop around every corner. With such readily available products, stocking up big until the next pickup is in the past for many. Still, there may be a time that someone is incentivized to buy an enormous amount of weed, or perhaps they found a forgotten jar in the back of the closet. In these cases, it may be time to figure out how to rehydrate old cannabis flower.\nSmoking or vaping old dry cannabis without rehydrating it is not ideal. When dry, cannabis buds can lead to harsh hits that cause coughing, sore throat, or even headaches. Dry weed will also tend to lose terpene content. As a result, the overly dry flower will not smell or taste as good as weed that’s been properly stored.\nRELATED: Cannabis mystery may be solved with lifestyle change\nLike terpenes, cannabinoids will alter over time. THC may degrade into CBN , a cannabinoid with a wildly different effect. Those hoping for the uplifting that once was may be met with a heavy, relaxing variety if the weed has aged. Be mindful of this when choosing to consume old cannabis.\nThe best way to avoid smoking dry weed is to store it correctly long term. Keep cannabis fresh by storing it in a mason jar with a humidity pack. There are also specialty stash containers designed for the job that works just as well as a glass jar. Skip plastic bags. Grab an airtight stash container.\nWhile these methods to store cannabis can keep cannabis fresh long term, sometimes it dries out. If it does, there are a few tried and true methods to rehydrate your weed.\nWhat to do when the weed is dry Weed gets dry sometimes. When it does, there are a few methods to get moisture levels back on track. These tricks will not add terpenes or cannabinoids back but could offset dry throat, coughing, and potential headaches.\nHumidity Packs Adding humidity control packs to a jar of weed can help keep it fresh and add moisture back in. These squishy packets can regulate the humidity of a closed container thanks to a mixture of salt and water inside. The mixture hardens once its capabilities hit capacity. Humidity packs can stabilize the environment inside a weed jar in one to seven days without adding unwanted flavor.\nFruit Peels Neighborhood dealers have used lemons, orange, and limes to rehydrate weed for generations. The method adds a scent and flavor to the bud along with moisture, which can be good or bad depending on who smokes it. Citrus peels work best, but the fruit peel method works with banana and apple peels, too. While this method can make cannabis moist enough to eat, keep track of the peels to avoid any moldy or otherwise gross fruit peels from touching flower.\nDamp paper towel A damp paper towel or cotton ball makes for an easy, low-cost way to rehydrate pot. While simple, it is also risky. Keep the cotton ball or paper towel in the jar for an hour or up to a day. However, do not let the wet items touch the weed, if possible, to avoid mold growth. Carefully monitor moisture levels while using this trick for the same reason.\nBread Moisture transfer also works between bread and cannabis. Rehydrate weed with a tortilla or slice of bread, just like a fruit peel. Simply throw it into the jar, monitor for mold, and let it ride. This method could work in a few hours. Be mindful to never use this trick when sharing with gluten-free friends.\nLettuce Greens like iceberg lettuce have a high moisture content that can be used to add moisture back to bud. Reports say this could bring the jar back to optimal humidity in two to three hours. Another draw is that lettuce does not add flavor and scent to bud like citrus peels. Take the greens out immediately after optimal moisture levels are achieved.\nRELATED: New cutting-edge marketplace speaks to unstoppable trend\nWhen not to smoke dry weed While it is possible to rehydrate weed, sometimes it is better to toss it. Old weed may develop mold or other issues that make it risky to consume. Properly storing your cannabis is only partly about keeping weed fresh. It can also help keep mold, bud rot, and other airborne pathogens at bay. Do not rehydrate and consume weed if there are any signs of bud rot, mold, or any other issues.\nFrequently asked questions about rehydrating cannabis There are many methods to rehydrate weed, and most of them include organic materials. This FAQ can help anyone with a jar of old, dry pot.\nCan you rehydrate old cannabis? Yes, it is possible to rehydrate old weed. There are many methods to add moisture back to cannabis flower, each with its own side effects on the bud.\nIs it safe to smoke old weed? Smoking anything is not necessarily safe, but in many cases smoking old weed is no more risky than freshly cured flower. Signs of mold, bud rot, or rancid smells indicate that pot should not be consumed.\nDo cannabis strains change over time? Terpenes and cannabinoids degrade or disappear altogether when the weed ages and dries out. This can alter how the cannabis smells, tastes, and its effects.\nHow to rehydrate old cannabis Storing cannabis is step one, but sometimes weed still dries out. When seeking out to rehydrate old cannabis, it is as easy as looking in the fruit bowl. Lettuce, citrus peels, bread, and even paper towels can make dry, harsh flower fresh again. Unfortunately, none of this will add cannabinoids or terps back, but the pot will be smokeable. Nobody wants to waste weed, and with these tips, they don’t have to.",
