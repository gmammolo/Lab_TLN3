  "text": "Americans are facing heightened anxiety and sleepless nights, grappling with intense feelings about the future due to the election results. In response, more people are turning to alternative forms of stress management, including cannabis and ketamine treatments, to help them cope in this post-election period.\nRELATED: What another Trump presidency means for weed\nKeta Medical Center , which offers ketamine therapy across four locations in New York and New Jersey, has seen a significant uptick in patients seeking pre and post-election stress relief. The centers reported an 18.6 percent increase in appointments in October compared to September, with many patients continuing treatments post-election to help manage stress, anxiety, and depression.\nKetamine has gained attention in the medical world for its mental health applications, particularly for easing anxiety and treatment-resistant depression. According to Dr.Cheryl Malina, a board-certified Emergency Medicine physician and co-founder of the centers, the election appeared to have exacerbated pre-existing anxiety and depression conditions for many patients. To manage the increase in patients seeking care, the centers stayed open for extended hours during election week.\nMeanwhile, many people in the cannabis community are finding their own paths to relaxation. Caroline Murphy, founder of the cannabis lifestyle brand High On Plants , embraced Wana THC Raspberry Iced Tea as a calming ritual in response to post-election stress.\n“It’s been a way to calm the chaos and ground myself,” Murphy shared, explaining that the effects of THC, when combined with CBD and CBG , have helped her feel more centered.\nThis was echoed by Dina, founder of Grass Goddess Consulting , who turned to a CBD and CBG edible to manage her stress levels. After taking the edible, she felt more relaxed during a doctor’s appointment and was surprised to find her blood pressure was normal and not elevated, an improvement she attributes to the product’s calming effects.\nA woman eats a CBD gummy.

Event producer and community builder Ashlee Belzo relied on Camino Sours Blackberry Dream ‘Sleep’ gummies, infused with CBD, CBN , THC, and sleep-supporting terpenes, to unwind the night before election results were finalized. She noted that the gummy’s balanced formula helped her get a full night’s rest.\nInhalable forms of cannabis also played a crucial role for people looking for immediate stress relief. Sarah Meeker, a Maryland resident, took the day off work when she felt overwhelmed by election-related news and turned to her Storz & Bickel Volcano , a device for vaporizing cannabis flower.\n“I was so tense, and my emotions were running high,” Meeker shared. “Using my Volcano allowed me to inhale THC and exhale my stress.”\nRELATED: The first legal psilocybin gummies have arrived\nFor some, like Aubrey Nicole, a human resources professional in the cannabis industry, cannabis products like Wana’s fast-acting gummies containing CBD and CBG have become a staple for regulating her nervous system.\n“With CBD and CBG, I’m able to stay present and surrender to the flow of things without feeling overpowered by my stress,” she explained.\nSimilarly, Francesca Cserr, owner of Dab Cowgirl Marketing , turned to Betty’s Eddies edibles with increased CBD, CBG, and THC levels to help maintain balance in her daily routine.\nAs the emotional weight of the election season begins to lift, many are finding that these alternative wellness solutions provide them with not only physical relief but also emotional resilience. I found it fascinating that so many people consumed edibles that contained cannabinoids outside of your standard THC and CBD.\nFor individuals across the spectrum of cannabis and ketamine use, these therapeutic methods offer a steadying influence in a post-election environment that feels anything but predictable. While I wish circumstances were different, I am happy that people are embracing new, meaningful ways to cope, thanks to cannabis and ketamine.\n*This article was submitted by a guest contributor.
