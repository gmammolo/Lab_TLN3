  "text": "The Allan Labor Government is making sure Victorian kids have the swimming skills they need to stay safe with affordable swimming lessons this summer. Applications open next Wednesday for the popular VICSWIM Summer Kidz Program, which teaches kids basic swimming skills as well as crucial water safety education at a subsidised cost of $35 for a week of lessons. Families with kids aged four to 12 can choose to enrol in five 30-minute lessons, which run over the course of a week, or four 35-minute lessons. VICSWIM’s learn-to-swim program has helped generations of kids learn the skills and water safety knowledge they need to stay safe in and around water – so they can enjoy their summers by the pool and near the ocean. An extra $117,000 has been invested into the program to provide tailored lessons for kids with disability[ ]and from multicultural backgrounds. The additional funding will create 400 extra spots for kids across the state. The boost takes the Victorian Government’s investment in the program to $917,000. It’s part of wide-ranging efforts to promote swimming safety and ensure even more kids get their chance to learn water-safety basics. Last summer, more than 16,000 Victorian children took part at 169 swimming centres across the state – with 120 of these located in regional Victoria. Lessons for kids with a disability will be provided across six council areas including Darebin, Merri-bek, Frankston, Southern Grampians, Knox and Whittlesea. Kids from CALD backgrounds can sign up for swim lessons in 11 council areas, from regional cities like Mildura to metro suburbs including Dandenong. Registrations for the VICSWIM Summer Kidz Program open on 13 November. For more information visit [vicswim.com.au](#). As stated by Minister for Community Sport Ros Spence “The importance of water safety knowledge and swimming skills cannot be overestimated – and this program is making sure all Victorian kids have these crucial skills.” As stated by CEO of Aquatics Recreation Victoria Kathy Parton “ARV is pleased to run its 49th annual VICSWIM Summer Kidz affordable water safety education/learn to swim program for children in beaches, lakes, rivers and aquatic centres across regional and metropolitan Victoria.” “This highly valued program has never been more important as it fills a vital void in the State’s Learn to Swim offering providing swimming lessons to communities who would often not have access to swimming lessons.” [here].",
