  "text": "On to Phoenix … Tyler Ankrum has reached the NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series (NCTS) season finale at Phoenix Raceway to finish off a career best season. The driver of the No. 18 LIUNA Chevrolet Silverado RST was just short of making the Championship round after his impressive run from the tail to eighth-place at Martinsville Speedway last Friday. In his first season with the MHR organization, Ankrum has posted his career high in top-five’s, top-10’s, laps led, and average finish. Heading into Phoenix, Ankrum is ranked eighth in the drivers’ point standings. Playoff Run… In his third career NCTS playoff run, Ankrum gave it his all, earning four top-10 finishes and one top-five result through six races. He advanced to the Round of 8 with strong performances, including top-10 finishes at The Milwaukee Mile and Bristol Motor Speedway. Despite a 14th-place finish at Talladega Superspeedway, Ankrum rebounded with a top-five at Homestead-Miami Speedway, entering Martinsville Speedway 41 points away from the cutoff. After starting from the rear of the field, the San Bernardino, Calif. native charged through the field, gaining 26 positions to finish in eighth. 2024 Season Stats… In his sixth full-time NCTS season and first with MHR, Ankrum delivered a standout performance, achieving career highs in multiple categories. He recorded 12 top-10 finishes, six top-five finishes, and two stage wins, along with a career-best average finish of 12.5. Ankrum also led the points standings for the first four events for the first time in his NCTS career. Over the course of the year, he scored 30 or more points in 13 races. His best finish came at Las Vegas Motor Speedway where he earned a strong runner-up result. Tune In …The 2024 season finale for the NCTS will kick off practice on Thursday evening. Television coverage beings Friday afternoon with qualifying at 4:00 p.m. ET on FOX Sports 2. The final green flag of the year will wave at 8:00 p.m. ET on FOX Sports 1. Stay connected with the No. 18 LIUNA team by following @BMR_NASCAR on Twitter, @bmrnascar on Instagram, and Bill McAnally Racing on Facebook. Tyler Ankrum Quote: On The Season Finale at Phoenix: “It’s a little bittersweet to not be competing for a championship this weekend. This No. 18 LIUNA team has given me a great truck all season long. This week we will go out and give everything we have to show what we are capable of. Though we aren’t battling for the title we are going to go enjoy ourselves and try to get into victory lane and finish the season off with a statement.” MHR PR [see all](https://speedwaydigest.com/index.php/author/speedwaydigeststaff/)) [Toyota Racing – NCTS Championship 4 Media Day – Corey Heim – 11.07.24](https://speedwaydigest.com/index.php/news/nascar-truck-series-news/319128-toyota-racing-ncts-championship-4-media-day-corey-heim-11-07-24/)- November 7, 2024[NASCAR Championship Weekend Media Day (Ty Majeski & Cole Custer)](https://speedwaydigest.com/index.php/news/xfinity-series-news/319125-nascar-championship-weekend-media-day-ty-majeski-cole-custer/)- November 7, 2024[AM Racing to Field ARCA Menards Series West Entry for Kole Raz at Phoenix Raceway](https://speedwaydigest.com/index.php/news/racing-news/319110-am-racing-to-field-arca-menards-series-west-entry-for-kole-raz-at-phoenix-raceway/)- November 7, 2024",
