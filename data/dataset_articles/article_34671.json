  "text": "Since 2017, UCI MIND has partnered with the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement (WAM) founded by Maria Shriver, to fund the Women’s Initiative. The initiative provides funding for research to better understand why women are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease than men.\nThis year, the UCI MIND WAM Women’s Initiative is proud to support two exceptional investigators at UCI with groundbreaking research projects:\n- Dr.\nMaría Corrada, Professor of Neurology in the School of Medicine and Professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics in the Joe C. Wen School of Public Health, will explore “Estrogen Replacement Therapy and the Association with Neuropathological Changes.” - Dr.\nKaren Lincoln, Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health in the Joe C. Wen School of Public Health and Director of the Center for Environmental Health Disparities, will investigate “Sex Differences in the Influence of Psychosocial Stress, Inflammatory Pathways, and Pain on Dementia Risk in Black Americans.”\nDrs. Corrada and Lincoln are the eighth and ninth researchers to be funded since the inception of this impactful program.",
