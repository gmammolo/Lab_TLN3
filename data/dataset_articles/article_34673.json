New research suggests that laughter therapy might be just as effective as eye drops for reducing symptoms of dry eye disease, according to an international study published in The BMJ journal.\nDry eye disease, a common condition, occurs when tears fail to adequately lubricate the eyes, leading to uncomfortable symptoms like itching, soreness and redness.\nTo explore alternative treatments, researchers from China, the United States and Queen’s University Belfast tested whether laughter therapy could provide relief comparable to artificial tears.\nThe study involved nearly 300 adults, aged 18 to 45, who were randomly divided into two groups: one using sodium hyaluronic acid eye drops, commonly known as artificial tears, and the other participating in a laughter therapy routine.\nLaughter therapy, previously trialed for various health conditions, involves exercises designed to stimulate laughter and pleasant feelings. For this study, researchers adapted the therapy to specifically engage the eye muscles.\nParticipants in the laughter therapy group viewed an instructional video and repeated playful phrases such as ‘Hee hee hee, hah hah hah, cheese cheese cheese, cheek cheek cheek’ 30 times per five-minute session. They practiced this four times daily over the eight-week period, while the other group used eye drops with the same frequency.\nThe effectiveness of both treatments was measured by tracking changes in participants’ ocular surface disease index scores, which reflect the severity of dry eye symptoms. By the end of the study, both groups showed a significant reduction in symptoms, indicating that laughter therapy was “non-inferior” to eye drops in treating dry eyes. While researchers noted that the exact biological mechanism behind laughter’s impact on dry eyes is still unclear, the results suggest that laughter therapy could be a promising option for those with dry eye disease. In addition to its effectiveness, they highlighted laughter therapy as a safe, low-cost, and environmentally friendly intervention, making it particularly appealing to patients seeking non-medicated approaches to eye care.\nThe study adds to the growing body of research on laughter therapy, which has been explored for conditions ranging from stress to chronic pain. For those with dry eyes looking for a fresh approach, it turns out that a good laugh might truly offer a new way to see the world more comfortably.\nPHOTO: ENVATO PHOTO: ENVATO\nRelated News Features Clinging to hope 3 hours ago Southeast Asia Thai court clears woman over deadly 2015 bombing 3 hours ago Features From fast to ‘past’ fashion 3 hours ago",
