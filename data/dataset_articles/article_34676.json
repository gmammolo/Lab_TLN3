  "text": "Top 5: Tips for Canine Parvovirus Treatment Sponsored by Elanco Even in the face of effective vaccines, canine parvovirus remains a major cause of mortality in at-risk dogs,1 and although the serious medical risks of canine parvovirus are well-known, these are not the only risks this disease can pose. The associated isolation during treatment can also impact a patient’s well-being, potentially having impacts on a patient’s socialization and behaviors later in life. In a recent Clinician’s Brief Partner webinar series, both the physical and behavioral effects of parvovirus were explored. Read on to discover 5 key takeaways from the event, and be sure to check out the full webinars to earn CE credit. The Parvovirus Webinar Series Takeaway #1: Administer Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody to Stop Parvovirus Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody (CPMA) is the first and only USDA conditionally approved monoclonal antibody treatment for canine parvovirus. It has been shown to be well-tolerated in puppies as young as 6 weeks of age and has a low risk for mild side effects (eg, diarrhea, pruritus, injection site reactions).2 CPMA not only helps reduce the duration of clinical signs, but it can also prevent mortality in affected dogs. In a study evaluating the efficacy of CPMA, 28 dogs were experimentally infected with parvovirus.1 Four days later, all dogs tested positive for parvovirus via SNAP Parvo Test; 21 of these dogs received CPMA treatment. Although 57% of the dogs in the control group died, no deaths occurred in the dogs that received CPMA treatment.1 Takeaway #2: Early & Aggressive Supportive Care Is Key Supportive care, including fluid therapy, plays a key role in parvovirus treatment. Isotonic crystalloids are readily available and provide rapid volume expansion, making them the fluid of choice for the initial restoration of intravascular volume and hydration for the parvovirus patient.2,3 Isotonic crystalloid fluid therapy should be initiated at split consecutive boluses of 15-20 mL/kg given over 15 minutes until improvement of perfusion status is achieved.3 Further fluid therapy can be administered based on assessment of patient perfusion parameters.3 However, hydration is not the only form of supportive care required for parvovirus. Because hypoglycemia is a common condition in puppies, especially those with parvovirus, blood glucose should be monitored carefully and dextrose should be added to fluids if indicated.4 Additional recommended supportive care treatments include antiemetics, pain medications, nutritional support, and antibiotics.4 Takeaway #3: Provide Early Nutritional Support Placing a nasogastric tube for nutritional support should be considered as soon as the patient is cardiovascularly stable. Enteral nutrition offers several benefits for patients with parvovirus; it can help maintain GI barrier function and prevent malnutrition.5 Canine parvovirus patients that receive enteral nutrition tend to have more rapid normalization of appetite, along with improved weight gain and clinical scores.5 Artimus, a 6-month-old, CMPA-treated parvovirus survivor, Easy Bay SPCA, November 2023 Takeaway #4: Mitigate the Impacts of Isolation on Patient Well-Being Parvovirus treatment requires isolation. Unfortunately, this isolation can occur at a critical period in a puppy’s social development, as young puppies are at the highest risk for parvovirus due to insufficient immunity.4 This isolation can contribute to behavioral concerns such as attention-seeking behavior, excessive vocalization, and fear-related aggression. Patient well-being should be supported by providing physical, social, and mental stimulation to the extent that is possible within the confines of safe isolation practices. At patient discharge, clients should be educated about ways to mitigate the effects of isolation, including intentional socialization and desensitization/counterconditioning to medical handling. Takeaway #5: Minimize the Time a Patient Must Spend in Isolation Even when enrichment is provided, the best option for patient well-being is to discharge the patient to their home environment as early as possible. CPMA has been shown to reduce the duration of vomiting, lethargy, and inappetence associated with parvovirus infection.1 Evaluation of transactional data showed that parvovirus patients treated with CPMA are discharged, on average, 1.87 days earlier than parvovirus patients that do not receive CPMA treatment.6 Shorter hospitalization times, as seen in parvovirus patients that received CPMA, can reduce the likelihood of puppies developing behavioral issues associated with prolonged isolation. Conclusion Medical treatment of canine parvovirus has long focused on supportive care. Although supportive care still plays an essential role in the treatment of canine parvovirus, CPMA is a valuable therapy that can be added to the practitioner’s toolkit, helping to reduce mortality associated with parvovirus and the duration of clinical signs. In addition to the medical aspects of parvovirus treatment, it is important to consider behavioral sequelae of hospitalization and isolation. Mental, social, and physical stimulation should be provided when appropriate, and with the utilization of CPMA, the duration of hospitalization and its impacts on patient well-being can be minimized, helping patients feel better and get home sooner.
