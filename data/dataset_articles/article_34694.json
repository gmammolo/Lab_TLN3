  "text": "For exercisers of all abilities, having a goal on the horizon can provide the motivation needed to get outside this time of year. Registration for the TC 10K opened on Wednesday with the theme’s message “where everyone is welcome,” say organizers.\n“You’re welcome to walk, welcome to run, welcome to connect, and, most importantly, welcome to be yourself,” say organizers.\nThe 36th annual event focuses on “inclusivity, community and the joy of moving together,” says organizer, Mark deFrias.\n“Whether you’re a runner or it’s your first time in the event, or you’re a walker, we want everyone to feel like they can participate. And that’s the beauty of the TC-10K,” adds deFrias.\n“No matter you’re ability, no matter where you come from, everyone is welcome.”\nAccording to deFrias, last year’s event brought out more than 8,500 participants and this year’s goal is to see more than 10,000 joggers and walkers sign up.\nIn addition to the theme, the route has a few changes this year. However, deFrias says it will still start and end by the B.C. legislature.\nIn addition to having a goal on the horizon – a decent playlist, or joining a running group, can help by a mile or two.\nThe TC 10K runs on April 27, 2025 and registration opened Wednesday. Early bird registration is $60 for the 10 km and $25 for the family run.\nFor more information, visit TC10K.ca .\nFor a list of running groups in Victoria, visit runguides.com .\nSEE ALSO:\nTC10K run sees a record breaking turnout with over 8.5K participants Thousands turn up for TC 10K Run in Victoria",
