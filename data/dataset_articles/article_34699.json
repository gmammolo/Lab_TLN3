  "text": "Baptist Health Announces Expansion of Cancer Care Services in the Florida Keys\nKEY WEST, FL – November 7, 2024 – Baptist Health announces the expansion of its cancer care services in the Florida Keys with a new standalone facility in Key West. Part of Baptist Health Cancer Care, the new center will be led by a team of physicians, and offer a variety of infusion services, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapies for patients. Located on the site of the former Genesis Cancer Center, the facility is expected to open in Summer 2025, making it easier for Key West and Lower Keys residents to receive care.\n“We are thrilled to be able to provide additional Baptist Health Cancer Care services for patients in the Florida Keys with our new cancer location,” said Michael Zinner, MD, CEO and executive medical director of Miami Cancer Institute and Baptist Health Cancer Care. “This facility will offer convenient care for our patients who live in or near Key West, and we’re pleased to be able to meet their needs closer to home.”\nThe two-story building spans 4,300 square feet and, upon completion, will offer advanced cancer care for patients. The new facility will feature physician offices, an infusion center, a new linear accelerator to deliver radiation therapy, and an on-site CT simulator to plan radiation, all housed within a refreshed and welcoming environment.\n“This building represents an important milestone for both Baptist Health and the Keys community,” said Jay Hershoff, Baptist Health Board of Trustees chair. “The area is growing at a rapid pace, and with that growth comes the need for additional health services. Baptist Health continues to be at the forefront of medical care, providing residents and visitors with the clinical support they need by the experts that they trust.”\nThe announcement of the new location is in line with Baptist Health’s standing commitment to better serving the health and wellness needs of the Florida Keys community. Earlier this year, Baptist Health Fishermen’s Community Hospital opened the new Walsh Family Medical Arts Building, expanding access to infusion services and primary care in the Middle Keys.\nFor more information, please visit [baptisthealth.net/services/cancer-care](https://baptisthealth.net/services/cancer-care)\nAbout Baptist Health\nBaptist Health is the largest healthcare organization in the region, with 12 hospitals, more than 28,000 employees, 4,000 physicians and 200 outpatient centers, urgent care facilities and physician practices spanning across Miami-Dade, Monroe, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
