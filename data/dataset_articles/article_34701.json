  "text": "By Jane Kirby ,\n21 minutes ago Senior Clinical Practice Facilitator Nicole Prescott administering breakthrough treatment to patient Katie Tinkler for lupus Lucy North/PA Wire Three people have received a”groundbreaking” treatment for lupus on the NHS , in fresh hopes to eradicate the need for lifelong drugs .\nLupus can range from mild to severe, with symptoms including joint pain, skin problems, fatigue and inflammation of major organs. People often take drugs for life, ranging from ibuprofen to steroid tablets and injections, or other immunosuppressant or biological medicines.\nFamous people with lupus include actress and singer Selena Gomez, who has spoken about how it affects her, and singer Paula Abdul.\nUntil now, CAR T-cell therapy in the UK has been used only in cancer patients, but researchers believe it could treat range of diseases including lupus and multiple sclerosis.\nThe therapy works by genetically modifying cells to enable the body’s own immune system to recognise and attack problem cells, offering people a possible cure.\nIn the new NHS trial, led by University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) and University College London (UCL), three patients have received CAR T-cell therapy for the most serious form of lupus, a condition that can be life-threatening and cause damage to the heart, lungs, brain and kidneys.\n(L-R) UCLH Consultant Haematologist and UCL Cancer Institute researcher Claire Roddie, Cell Therapy Research Sister Maia Collins, and Senior Clinical Practice Facilitators Nicole Prescott and Rob McDonnell prepare to administer a breakthrough CAR T infusion treatment for lupus (Lucy North/PA Wire) Early indications are that the therapy – which only needs to be given once – could “revolutionise treatment” and remove the need for lifelong medication.\nIn Germany, patients who underwent CAR T-cell therapy more than a year ago are now in remission and do not need to take lupus drugs.\nThe first British patient, a 32-year-old mother called Katherine, was treated at the National Institute for Health and Care Research Manchester Clinical Research Facility at Manchester Royal Infirmary in July.\nTwo other UK patients have undergone treatment at UCLH, with one of them – 50-year-old Katie Tinkler – receiving CAR T on Wednesday this week.\nSelena Gomez has lupus (Getty Images) Mrs Tinkler, a mother of three from Guildford, has had lupus for 30 years and suffers debilitating symptoms including joint pain and kidney disease.\nShe told the PA news agency she was “beyond excited” to take part in the trial.\n“If this works, it’s life changing,” she said.\n“Up ’til now, there’s never been anything for lupus that is a possible cure.\n“The dream is to be lupus-free – that would be phenomenal.”\nMrs Tinkler, whose lupus has got worse over the last decade, said: “When the professor phoned me and said ‘we’re bringing a trial here, would you be interested?’ oh my gosh, I jumped at it.\n“I feel that my body’s getting tired, I’ve had this for 30 years, it’s being attacked from inside 24/7.\n“My body’s struggling with it all now, and it’s definitely got worse over the last decade … So I just feel any opportunity that I can have is great.”\nPatient Katie Tinkler talks with her husband Simon before she receives a breakthrough treatment for lupus (Lucy North/PA Wire) The first British patient treated – Katherine from Manchester – said she “couldn’t believe it” when she was told she could take part in the trial.\n“When you speak about lupus, you don’t talk about the possibility of coming off medication,” she said.\n“Nothing had worked permanently for me. All the drugs, even when taken at high doses, have just offered temporary relief and nothing has really helped with the pain. I thought ‘this could be a solution I never thought possible’.”\nKatherine was diagnosed with lupus in her late 20s and it turned her life “upside down”.\nShe said: “I had to give up my job in banking. I had difficulty just getting out of bed, climbing the stairs and even doing day-to day tasks. I was forced to adapt to living life in a different way.\n“I cried happy tears going home from that (trial) appointment, thinking that there was a chance I could wake up every morning without pain, being able to do things like play with my daughter, and imagining all the possibilities of living a somewhat normal life – it felt amazing.”\nPatients in the new study will be followed up for 15 years to fully assess the effects of the treatment.\nBut medics are hoping CAR T-cell therapy could correct the underlying defect in lupus and potentially cure those with the most serious form of the disease.\nEven after a few weeks, Katherine said she feels she has “more energy” and has no joint swelling, adding: “I’m feeling hopeful for the future.”\nProfessor Ben Parker, consultant rheumatologist and study lead at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, told PA: “We are delighted to be the first to deliver this fantastic research in the UK, which we hope will revolutionise treatment for patients with high-risk lupus, that could potentially lead to a cure for the disease.\n“Lupus is a disease that requires lifelong medication, but this therapy has the potential to change that, which is incredibly exciting.\n“This groundbreaking new therapy marks a significant milestone in our research into lupus.”\nKatie Tinkler receives a breakthrough treatment for lupus at University College London Hospital in London (Lucy North/PA Wire) Prof Parker explained that the treatment involved programming the CAR T cells, adding: “Ultimately, it offers a very radical treatment for lupus compared to what’s currently available.\n“What currently is available are treatments that suppress the immune system, that you have to continually take, that are partially effective in most people, very effective in a few people and ineffective in a substantial number of patients with lupus.\n“The CAR T treatment offers something very different…\n“In those people who’ve received it, they have been able to stop their immunosuppression after receiving CAR T and remain in what’s called drug-free remission.\n“So it’s potentially very radical, but it still needs to be proven that what we’ve seen in a small number of people is replicable in a trial setting and then in more routine use.”\nPeople undergoing CAR T require a 10-day hospital stay and are warned of possible side-effects, such as their immune system being very susceptible to infection for several weeks or another condition that causes the immune system to go into overdrive.\nHowever, many patients whose lupus is getting worse and who may be entering kidney failure, for example, decide the risks are worth it.\nUCLH consultant rheumatologist Dr Maria Leandro said: “We have seen the effectiveness of CAR T in cancer, particularly blood cancers, and hope we can replicate this in autoimmune diseases, starting with lupus.\n“Our early phase trial aims to recruit 12 people worldwide and we hope to replicate the results of a small German trial which showed an improvement in lupus patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy.”\nThe CAR T in the study is obecabtagene autoleucel (obe-cel) and the clinical trial is sponsored by Autolus Limited.",
