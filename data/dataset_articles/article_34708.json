  "text": "Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], November 8 (ANI): A revolutionary Total Knee Replacement (TKR) was performed on a patient with severe osteoarthritis and significant deformities. The complex procedure utilized state-of-the-art robotic-assisted technology combined with customizable implants, a cutting-edge approach that offers unparalleled precision and personalization.

The patient, suffering from dwarfism, had previously undergone surgery to lengthen his thigh bone. However, his short stature posed complex surgical challenges, compounding the severity of the degeneration and deformities. Upon initial assessment, the patient exhibited limited knee function, persistent pain and atypical bone proportions that made standard knee implants unsuitable.

Further thorough investigations, including X-rays, scanogram, and a detailed CT scan, revealed disproportionate distal femur dimensions that were too small for conventional prosthetics, underscoring the need for a highly customized approach. \"Managing this case required more than a standard implant; we needed to precisely match the patient's unique bone structure,\" explained Prashanth B N, Consultant Orthopaedics & Joint Replacement. \"Using CT imaging and 3D modelling, we designed patient-specific implants that accurately replicated the natural condylar proportions and ensured precise rotational alignment, which is essential for joint stability and function,\" he further added. This advanced approach not only restored function to the knee but minimized complications associated with the patient's complex anatomy. Arun Ranganathan, Director & HOD, Orthopedics, Spine & Trauma, noted, \"Our hospital is equipped to provide comprehensive orthopaedic care, with a dedicated team and advanced solutions for complex cases like this, ensuring the best possible outcomes. Narayana Health City can deliver such outcomes time and again because of our expertise and collaborative approach.\" Abhinandan S Punit, Consultant Orthopaedics & Joint Replacement, added, \"At Narayana Health City, we have the surgical expertise and cutting-edge joint replacement capabilities necessary to take on complex orthopaedic cases and achieve successful, precise results for our patients.\" This unique case highlights the growing importance of patient-specific implants in treating advanced orthopedic conditions, particularly as knee osteoarthritis becomes more prevalent in patients with varied and challenging anatomies. Patient Raveendra Ittangudi from Kalaburagi, Karnataka said, \"After years of severe leg pain that restricted my ability to sit, walk, and carry out normal movements, I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Prashanth BN and the dedicated team of doctors at Narayana Health. They addressed my condition with skill and compassion, correcting my deformity and performing a personalised total knee replacement. Today, I can walk normally, free from pain and without any difficulty. I can't thank them enough for helping me regain my mobility and independence.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",
