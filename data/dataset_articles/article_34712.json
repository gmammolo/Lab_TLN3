  "text": "Online Avenova ® sales increase 14% for the quarter and 19% for the nine months Sales and marketing expenses declined 25% for the quarter and 18% for the nine months reflecting digital marketing optimization NovaBay ® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: NBY) reports financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n“Avenova sales through the online channel for the quarter increased 14% over the prior year, while we reduced our marketing spend by 25% in the same period as we further optimized our highly efficient digital marketing programs,” said Justin Hall, CEO of NovaBay. “We saw continued momentum in Avenova online sales into the current quarter. Sales through Amazon in October continued to be strong with a successful Prime Day event.”\nFinancial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 do not include results from DERMAdoctor, which was divested on March 25, 2024 and is accounted for in discontinued operations. Financial information about discontinued operations is available under “Divestiture and Discontinued Operations” in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) later today.\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nTotal sales, net for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.4 million. Essentially all net sales for the quarter were derived from sales of eyecare products. Total sales, net for the third quarter of 2023 were $2.5 million, which included $2.4 million from sales of eyecare products and $0.1 million from sales of wound care products.\nGross margin on net sales for the third quarter of 2024 was 65%, compared with 67% for the third quarter of 2023, with the change primarily due to changes in the product mix.\nSales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.9 million, a 25% decrease from $1.3 million for the prior-year period, reflecting continued efficiencies in digital advertising and lower consulting costs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.7 million, compared with $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, with the increase due to higher legal costs.\nAccretion of interest and amortization of discounts on convertible notes for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.1 million, compared with $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million, or $0.60 per share. This compares with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2023 of $1.8 million, or $13.11 per share.\nNine Month Financial Results\nTotal sales, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $7.5 million, compared with $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross margin on net sales for the first nine months of 2024 was 67%, compared with 60% for the first nine months of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales and marketing expenses decreased 18% and G&A expenses increased 28%, both compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 was $7.4 million, or $3.97 per share, compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2023 of $7.5 million, or $79.58 per share.\nNovaBay had cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $2.9 million as of December 31, 2023. In July 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of $3.9 million.\nAbout NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nNovaBay's leading product Avenova ® Lid & Lash Cleansing Spray is often recommended by eyecare professionals for blepharitis and dry eye disease. Manufactured in the U.S., Avenova spray is formulated with NovaBay's patented, proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid.
