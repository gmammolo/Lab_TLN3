  "text": "Bob Keroack TRIBE SCRIBE: Dedication to nutrition helps Kadin Lynch do what he does on the field 11/7/2024 4:21:00 PM By Dave Johnson W&M Athletics What college student wouldn't savor a nice, cheesy slice of pizza? If our subject is Kadin Lynch, William & Mary's sophomore left guard, it's someone who views it only as a means to an end. Lynch has long been a workout fiend, but since coming to college he's become strongly interested in how nutrition correlates with physical fitness. His daily food intake consists mainly of grilled chicken, rice, fruits, vegetables, milk and Greek Yogurt. He goes to the grocery store and prepares it himself. \"I've gotten pretty passionate about learning how you perform is impacted by what you eat and how you train,\" said Lynch, who (no surprise) is majoring in kinesiology. \"Being able to refine my knowledge in that field has also helped me work harder and perform better. \"Being able to improve every aspect both on and off the field, my life mentally and physically, I attribute a lot of that to nutrition and eating well. Taking care of my body so I can stay healthy, stay on the field, and help the team is the biggest benefit of that.\" As for that slice of pizza, which generally (depending on ingredients) packs at least 300 calories, 12 grams of fat, 600 milligrams of sodium and 35 carbs? \"Very, very rarely will I splurge on anything like that,\" said Lynch, a very fit 6-foot-4, 295 pounds. \"If I do, it's typically post-game, trying to eat calories back into my body after performing on the field. \"But I try to be as strict as I can because when you need to consume a lot of calories, if you consume the right calories, they'll help you more in your recovery process than eating a bunch of junk food.\" Tribe coach Mike London is impressed with Lynch's dedication. \"I don't think I've ever seen him with a Snickers bar or a soda, anything like that,\" he said. \"He goes through the whole nutrition that equates to body fat percentage, to strength and conditioning, and rest and recovery. He's like the poster child to how you go about it.\" It's clearly paying dividends. As a redshirt freshman last season, despite starting only five games, Lynch was rated the No. 1 guard in the CAA by Pro Football Focus. PFF does game-by-game rankings, and Lynch was No. 4 in the FCS for last week's win at North Carolina A&T. \"It's impressive how he's taken it upon himself to maximize what he has,\" said Mario Acitelli, the Tribe's offensive coordinator and line coach. \"He puts himself in a good position and is ready when the time comes. He was ready last year, and he played really well. \"One of the most important things on the offensive line is the more you can play next to people for a longer period of time, the easier it gets. He's been next to (left tackle) Charles Grant and (center) Ryan McKenna for every game this season, and that's been really good.\" With Grant, Lynch and McKenna starting all nine games this season, the Tribe's offensive line is making room for a rushing attack that ranks third nationally at 252.4 yards a game. They're a main reason why Bronson Yoder is closing in on his second 1,000-yard season in three years. Born in Orlando and raised largely in Pittsburgh, Lynch was a two-time all-state right tackle (his quarterback was a lefty) at Asheville (N.C.) High. His parents have relocated to Richmond, but his brother and sister-in-law still live in Asheville, which remains in recovery mode after being hit hard by Helene. \"They both lost their car, but other than that, the house and everything was good,\" Lynch said. \"There's definitely a lot worse in the area.\" Lynch's high school coach was Cort Radford, who was a student assistant coach at Appalachian State during Acitelli's playing days there. Flash-forwarding a bit, and Acitelli met Lynch at a University of North Carolina football camp in 2021. When he was hired at W&M in January 2022, Acitelli was asked if he knew of any offensive linemen the Tribe should pursue. He immediately mentioned Lynch, and lead recruiter Darryl Blackstock took it from there. Lynch redshirted the '22 season and, his body lean and properly nourished, was ready to go for '23. Each day, Lynch shoots for 5,000 to 5,200 calories. His other daily allowances are 340 grams of protein, 140 grams of fat, and between 480-525 grams of carbohydrates. \"I'll track that pretty consistently, and there are very few exceptions in my diet,\" Lynch said. \"I look at the food I eat more as fuel to help me perform. And the reason I'm in the position I am is because of what I'm able to do athletically. \"It's pretty much the same stuff every day. I'm pretty consistent with what I eat.\" Lynch's dedication to nutrition has spread to the classroom. In addition to majoring in kinesiology, he's a TA with two of Assistant Professor Stephanie Caligiuri's classes — Science of Nutrition and Nutrition and the Brain. After his football career ends, hopefully after a lengthy stay in the NFL, Lynch wants to get into supplemental research and development in nutrition. Until then, he'll always be willing to share his knowledge and experience with a teammate. \"Charles Grant, a projected draft pick, came to me this past summer when he was trying to put on some weight and do it the proper way,\" Lynch said. \"To help him with that process and see it pay off as he's playing at a heavier weight now, it's fantastic. It's something I love to do.\" Print Friendly Version",
