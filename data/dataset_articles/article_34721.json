Prepare the herbed butter in advance to save yourself time on the big day!\nAbout This Recipe Rubbing butter under the skin of a whole turkey or turkey breast before roasting is a guaranteed way to infuse the meat with tons of fresh flavor, lock in moisture, and crisp up the skin.\nThe recipe I’m sharing with you today is garlic herb compound butter that’s ideal for any cut of turkey. To make it, softened butter is combined with fragrant fresh herbs like rosemary and sage as well as minced garlic.\nThe one “secret” ingredient? Olive oil! Adding a little olive oil to the herb butter keeps it smooth and spreadable, making it so much easier to spread beneath the skin of your turkey.\nIf you plan on roasting a whole turkey or turkey breast this holiday season, be sure to bookmark this garlic and herb butter recipe for seasoning your turkey!\nTools You’ll Need You’ll need a few pieces of kitchen equipment to prepare the butter herb rub:\nSmall mixing bowl — For combining the ingredients. Microplane — I prefer grating the garlic directly in the butter. If you don’t own a microplane, use a garlic press instead. Cutting board and knife — For chopping the fresh herbs. Measuring spoon — For measuring the herbs and olive oil. Parchment paper or plastic wrap — Only needed if you plan on shaping the butter and storing it for later. Recipe Ingredients You’ll need a handful of simple ingredients to make the herbed butter for your turkey:\nButter Olive Oil Garlic Fresh Rosemary Fresh Thyme Fresh Sage Fresh Parsley For the complete ingredient list and detailed instructions, scroll to the bottom of this post for the FREE printable recipe card.\nIngredient Notes Butter — If you’ve brined your turkey, I recommend using unsalted butter so as not to add extra unnecessary salt. Also, you must use softened butter to make the garlic herb butter for your Thanksgiving turkey (here’s my tutorial on how to soften butter quickly ). Garlic — Fresh is best; garlic powder will not deliver the same level of flavor. Herbs — Please use fresh herbs! If you only have dried herbs, use one-third the amount that the recipe calls for. How to Make Herb Butter for a Turkey a quick overview! This garlic herb compound butter comes together in about 5 minutes and can be refrigerated for later or immediately slathered under the turkey skin.\nMake the herb butter : Combine the softened butter, garlic, olive oil, and chopped fresh herbs in a mixing bowl. Shape into a log (optional) : If you wish to shape the butter and store it for later, transfer the butter mixture to a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap and shape into a log. Refrigerate until ready to use. Rub under the skin of the turkey : If you chilled the butter mixture, bring it back to room temperature. Gently loosen the turkey skin before rubbing the garlic herb butter around the bird and inside the cavity. (You want the butter to be rubbed directly onto the meat, beneath the skin.) The above is simply a quick summary of this recipe. Check out the full recipe in the free printable recipe card at the bottom of this post for all the detailed instructions.\nTips for Making This Recipe I like to wear gloves when loosening the skin of the turkey and slathering on the compound butter to keep my hands cleaner. If frying the turkey, I recommend only placing the butter under the skin and not in the cavity or the exterior. If smoking the turkey , I recommend placing a drip tray under the turkey while in the smoker to collect the excess butter as it melts. This helps keep the smoker cleaner because it produces less grease. Recipe FAQs Got questions about how to make this recipe? Here are the answers to a few commonly asked questions. Feel free to leave any other questions in the comments on this post and I’ll respond with answers.\nHow much butter should I rub over a turkey? The amount of herb butter you should use for different areas of the turkey will vary depending on how large your bird is.\nFor an average sized turkey (12 to 14 pounds), start with the below measurements , then adjust adding more according to your preference:\n2 tablespoons for turkey breast 2 tablespoons inside of cavity 3 to 4 tablespoons for all over turkey exterior Should I use salted or unsalted butter on my Thanksgiving turkey? If your turkey has been brined or injected with a marinade that contains salt, I suggest sticking with unsalted butter. Otherwise, salted butter works!\nWhat are the best herbs for flavoring a turkey? Can I use just one kind? Take your cue from Simon and Garfunkle and use a blend of fresh parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Using a blend of herbs creates a more nuanced flavor and will keep your holiday guests coming back for more!\nIf you don’t have all four herbs, use what you do have on hand. If possible, please use at least two types of fresh herbs to create the most flavorful turkey.\nCan I add salt and/or pepper? If so, how much? Yes, but only add a pinch! Remember that turkey brine is very salty, so if you’re brining your turkey then you really don’t need extra salt in the garlic herb butter.\nAnd if you’re using salted butter, you definitely don’t need to add extra salt to the mixture.\nCan I use this on chicken if I’m not roasting a turkey? Of course! Just note that you’ll need to use significantly less compound butter when using it for a roast chicken ; save any herbed butter that hasn’t touched the raw meat to use on dinner rolls, mashed potatoes, and more.\nCan I use this on turkey breast vs whole turkey? Of course! However, you’ll need roughly 2 tablespoons of the butter herb rub if using on just a turkey breast.\nCan the herb butter be prepared in advance? Yes, the garlic and herb butter can be prepared, rolled into a log, and sealed in parchment paper or plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for up to 5 days.\nStorage Instructions If you wind up with leftovers, they will last up to 5 days in the fridge. Only store leftover butter if it has not touched the raw turkey! Once the butter comes into contact with the raw turkey, it needs to be used or thrown away.\nLeftover butter can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Let it firm up in the fridge (sealed within parchment paper or plastic wrap) before transferring to a freezer bag or freezer-safe container.\nTry Making an Herb and Butter Rub for Your Turkey This Year!

Prepare the herbed butter in advance to save yourself time on the big day!\nPrint Ingredients 8 tablespoons butter (I prefer Kerrygold)* 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 large cloves garlic 1 tablespoon finely chopped rosemary 1 tablespoon thyme leaves ½ tablespoon finely chopped sage ½ tablespoon finely chopped parsley Instructions Making the Herb Butter Bring the butter to room temperature. If you forgot to do so, here’s a guide on how to soften butter quickly. Then, add the softened butter to a mixing bowl. Using a microplane grater, grate the garlic cloves into the bowl with the butter. Next, add the olive oil and chopped herbs. Combine the ingredients. You can do this using a fork, pastry cutter, or handheld electric mixer. Shaping the Herb Butter (Optional) If you wish to shape the butter, once the ingredients are all combined, transfer the butter mixture to a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap. Shape the butter mixture into a log, then roll up in the plastic wrap or parchment paper. After you’ve shaped the butter, place it in the fridge for 1 to 2 hours, or until firm. Using the Butter for Turkey You want to use softened butter for this, so if you’ve made it in advance and refrigerated the mixture, you’ll need to soften it first. Carefully loosen the skin on the turkey by using your fingers to separate the skin from the breast meat. I recommend starting on the side of the turkey closest to the cavity and working your way to the end of the breast by gently sliding your fingers under the skin once separated. Work slowly and carefully so you don’t tear the skin. Then, rub some of the softened herb butter over the breast meat (under the skin). Rub more butter inside the cavity of the turkey as well as all over on the outside of the turkey. Proceed with cooking the turkey according to your preference. Notes\n*Butter: If you've brined your turkey or are using a salt injected turkey, I recommend using unsalted butter so as not to add extra unnecessary salt. Also, you must use softened butter to make the garlic herb butter for your Thanksgiving turkey (here’s my tutorial on how to soften butter quickly).\nShaping the compound butter is only necessary if you're preparing it for later use or want to serve it on your holiday table alongside dinner rolls, etc. (i.e. as a flavored butter than as a rub for your roast turkey.)\nDid you make this?
