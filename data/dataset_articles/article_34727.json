[Published](https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(24)00714-4/abstract) in the American Journal of Infection Control, the researchers say the guidelines could promote early detection of C.auris in high-risk patients and prevent hospital outbreaks. Mount Sinai initially screened people with more obvious risk factors, including patients with a tracheostomy or those on a ventilator, before expanding the guidelines. Researchers screened 591 patients for C. auris who were admitted from a nursing home from January 2022 to September 2023. They identified eight cases that would have gone undiagnosed under the prior protocol.
