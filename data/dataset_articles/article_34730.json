  "text": "AHA podcast explores using telehealth to improve maternal care In an American Hospital Association [podcast](https://www.aha.org/advancing-health-podcast/2024-11-04-expanding-telehealth-services-and-access-successful-maternal-care), an obstetrician/gynecologist at Sanford Health Bemidji in Minnesota discusses the dramatic expansion of maternal telehealth capabilities in Minnesota, as well as an inspiring telehealth program that reaches families in rural areas. An AHA Chairperson’s [file](https://www.aha.org/news/chairpersons-file/2024-11-04-chair-file-transforming-maternal-health-care-and-outcomes) describes how hospitals are addressing all aspects of maternal care, including access, disparities, the social drivers of health and mental health concerns. The AHA offers newly designed [webpages](https://www.aha.org/advocacy/maternal-and-child-health) dedicated to maternal and child health highlighting case studies, podcasts, infographics and action plans. In addition, the association advocates for [policies](https://www.aha.org/advocacy/2024-09-28-federal-public-policy-and-legislative-solutions-improving-maternal-health) aimed to improve maternal health across the care continuum and collaborates with government and community partners on efforts to improve maternal health.",
