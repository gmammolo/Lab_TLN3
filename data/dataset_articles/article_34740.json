  "text": "Meet the 2024 ABTA grant recipients at the frontier of the brain tumor research community.\nDonations from individuals to large groups in the brain tumor community have been the engine to power the ABTA and invest more than $36 million in over 800 research projects to date. The ABTA has been dedicated to funding brain tumor research, especially for new scientists over the last half century. By investing in early-career researchers from the start of their medical training, ABTA aims to advance brain tumor research while empowering the next generation of doctors and scientists to make breakthroughs in neuro-oncology.\n“Through the funding of brain tumor research, the ABTA empowers talented researchers to pursue challenging questions in neuro-oncology,” says Ralph DeVitto, ABTA President and Chief Executive Officer. “We are proud to continue our legacy of funding critical brain tumor research and bringing hope to patients.”  \nThis year’s grants support research across key areas of brain tumor science, including biomarkers, genetics, new treatments, immunotherapy, and tumor spread in both adult and child brain tumors. Learn more about current ABTA grant recipients .\nWe warmly welcome this year’s new grant recipients:\nResearch Collaboration Grants are two-year, $200,000 grants awarded for multi-investigator multidisciplinary brain tumor collaborative research projects.
