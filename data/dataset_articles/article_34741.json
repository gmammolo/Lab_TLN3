  "text": "NORTH LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — One [healthcare system](/article/news/health/baptist-health-unveils-medical-clinic-rose-city/91-3cb41e4e-6762-4aff-b86e-b0150f0bae06) here in central Arkansas is advancing care through [artificial intelligence](/article/tech/artificial-intelligence-music-future/91-9c6705a9-134a-45eb-ac9d-d996dbcfdde9). AI can be helpful in many ways; in this case, it's making a positive change in the radiology department at Baptist Health. \"It's like another second set of eyes,\" Baptist Health North Little Rock's Vice President of Operations Jessica Rivera said. That's how Rivera described the hospital's new computer software improving neuroradiology. \"It helps the radiologist determine early detection of ms, early detection of something called Aria, which is micro bleeding in the brain,\" Rivera said. \"Then the other thing that it does, which is very impressive, is it'll take old MRIs and compare them to new ones so that they can early detect if there's any progression of a disease process within MS.\" Besides helping with early detection, Rivera said it's quicker for their radiologist to read the brain images, making a more accurate diagnosis. The AI software highlights the parts of the brain that need to be looked at. \"If the radiologist may have missed something with the naked eye, that artificial intelligence helps them to have a different look of it,\" Rivera said. The software isn't just limited to Baptist Health in North Little Rock. Rivera said Baptist Health uses it on all MRIs throughout the healthcare system and is the first hospital in the state to use it. And it isn't the only way they utilize AI. \"We have AI looking and helping us with patients and their throughput, meaning that when admitted to the hospital, how quickly can we get them out? How effectively is that done?\" Rivera said. \"It just helps us to improve AI and the ability to pull data from and help us leverage that, which is phenomenal for us.\" Rivera believes it will help them continue to advance in the future. \"I think AI is going to be hugely important,\" Rivera said. \"It's going to change the healthcare landscape in general.\"",
