  "text": "**Sponsored by Plus Therapeutics . This content is not an endorsement from the ABTA.**  \nReSPECT-GBM Patient Story | Jim, Recurrent Glioblastoma Survivor Dr. Jim Stockand, a dedicated educator with a PhD in Physiology, has spent the past 24 years inspiring students in the classroom. However, in 2022, his life took an unexpected turn when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. After undergoing standard treatment, Jim faced a daunting setback when the glioblastoma recurred just nine months later. In January 2023, Jim took a courageous step by participating in the ReSPECT-GBM trial for recurrent glioblastoma . The day after he went home from his single-dose treatment, Jim and his wife were able to take a 7-mile walk together—a cherished activity that he had been unable to enjoy for nearly a year.\nJim’s story is a testament to resilience, hope, and the power of pioneering medical research. His journey not only highlights the challenges faced by those battling cancer but also the incredible moments of joy that can emerge in the midst of adversity. To learn more about his journey and the ReSPECT-GBM trial, visit respect-trials.com/gbm. ( NCT01906385 ).\nThe ReSPECT-GBM clinical trial is an American Brain Tumor Association Featured Clinical Study.\nReSPECT-LM Patient Story | Marlyn, Leptomeningeal Metastases Survivor At just 31 years old, while engaged in her Medical Residency in Pediatrics, Dr. Marlyn Cabrera faced a life-altering challenge: a diagnosis of breast cancer. For the next two decades, she navigated the complex landscape of treatment and recovery, showing incredible strength and determination. However, her journey took another difficult turn when the cancer metastasized to her cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and she was diagnosed with leptomeningeal metastases and given an estimated life expectancy of just 2 to 4 months.\nToday, more than six years after her initial diagnosis, Marlyn stands as a beacon of hope and resilience. After participating in the ReSPECT-LM Clinical Trial, she is eager to share her journey and the lessons learned along the way. Her firsthand experience emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and the transformative power of hope, bolstered by the unwavering support of her dedicated healthcare team and loved ones.
