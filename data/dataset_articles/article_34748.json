  "text": "WILKES-BARRE, LUZERNE CO. (WOLF) — The Health Resources & Services Administration estimates that nearly 18,000 people in the nation, ages 0-74, are diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses – in need of a bone marrow transplant. A donor looking for a potential match on the registry may forget they were on the list, like Delaney Hilferty. “I did not think I would be chosen at all it was amazing that I was. I was happy to help but it was a complete shock,” Hilferty says. Hilferty is a senior at King’s College in Wilkes-Barre, graduating in May with a degree in Business Management. Once finding out she was a match, she began the preliminary stages of donating bone marrow. “I answered a bunch of medical questions, and I did a full blood panel to double-check if I was a full match, which turned out I was, and we went on from there,” Hilferty explained. Undergoing the surgery three days ago, Hilferty is already back on campus. “It was a little slow, and we’re still a little slow right now, but we’re working our way up to walking normally again,” Hilferty said. Hilferty says the procedure is brief and manageable. “They go in the back of your pelvic bone in your lower back, and they insert two needles on both sides and dig around for about 45 minutes in the cartilage to take out what they need,” Hilferty says. Although her recipient is anonymous, Hilferty looks forward to meeting one day. “I can speak to him in a few years, I think. He has to reach out to me first before anything, but I would love to speak to him if he were to reach out,” Hilferty says. Hilferty is one of the women kickers on the football team! Head Coach Mike Cebrosky is ecstatic that his players want to give back to those in need. “For her to say she is willing to help somebody and save someone’s life, words can’t describe it. I am proud, she’s a great kid and will be a great leader one day of women just phenomenal,” Cebrosky said. Cebrosky says the team has been bringing awareness to the importance of stem cell research and donation for nearly a decade. “At 21 years old, she has done more in her life than most people have at 50 years old,” Cebrosky exclaimed.",
