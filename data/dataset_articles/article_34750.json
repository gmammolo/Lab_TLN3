  "text": "Dr. John S. Antalis was reelected by the Medical Association of Georgia as one of the six delegates from Georgia to represent the state at the American Medical Association for another two years. The American Medical Association is one of the most influential medical organizations in the country, helping shape healthcare policies and standards. Antalis has also been named the chairman of the Medical Association of Georgia Foundation. The foundation works to improve public health and support doctors across Georgia. As chairman, Antalis will lead efforts to address important health challenges, including improving access to care and educating communities on how to stay healthy. Southeast Medical Group's founding physician Thomas Bat has been elected to the Medical Association of Georgia Foundation board. Antalis is excited to work with Bat, believing that his wealth of experience will be a great asset to the foundation. These accomplishments reflect Antalis' dedication to not only providing exceptional care to his patients in Dalton but also to improving healthcare for everyone in Georgia. His leadership will continue to make a positive impact on both the medical community and the Greater Dalton community. Submitted by Southeast Primary Care Partners.",
