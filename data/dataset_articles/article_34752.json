  "text": "City provides update on Richmond Health Equity Fund RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) -Richmond is investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in new community-led programs to address health disparities in the city. Thursday morning, Mayor Levar Stoney, members of Richmond City Council, and staff with the Richmond Henrico Health Department announced $989,205 in new funding and an additional $388,240 in continued funding for community-based organizations making a difference in health equity. The money is part of the city’s[ health equity fund](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/richmond-city/health-equity-fund/), which was established in 2021 using federal dollars. It is a $5 million initiative aimed at providing healthcare resources to low-income communities. “Today marks another milestone with the Health Equity Fund, which further shines a light on lasting effects of the American rescue plan,” said Dr. Elaine Perry, director of the Richmond Henrico Health Department. Now, the city is expanding the number of organizations that get a portion of the money. “This is locally led. It’s a dedicated fund, investing in health services and social supports critically needed in our communities,” Stoney said. ”The awardees today, past and present, are making a difference, picking up where traditional healthcare organizations leave off, filling in the gaps. Unfortunately, so many of our residents have to navigate the gaps.\" The organizations selected approach health disparities in many of its forms. The groups address access to healthcare and education resources, chronic disease and underlying health conditions, food access and security, child and maternal health, mental and behavioral health, substance use, prevention and recovery. “These are generational issues, and it’s going to take that kind of investment to really turn it around, and using the ARPA funds in a way, we’re putting Richmond on the map as an innovator and as a city committed to equity,” 7th district city councilmember Cynthia Newbille said. [Nationz Foundation](https://nationzfoundationrva.org/) is one of the groups getting some of the money this round. Executive Director Zakia McKensey says it will really improve the impact they’re making. “This funding is really helping in the community, helping us to provide HIV and STI testing to people in the city of Richmond. It is also helping to have our mobile units out on the street offering food and other services to the community,” McKensey said. The additional boost announced on Thursday means she can continue to do that without the financial stress. The health equity fund is now looking for people to join its Community Advisory Committee. The committee could include any community member with professional and/or lived experience with health challenges in Richmond. The CAC selects partner organizations to get the funding. The [CAC application](https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=RRDPLK7PKKRLFTP9) will remain open until November 26. Individuals, organizations, or collaborators interested in applying for an HEF investment can submit applications in the spring of 2025. Copyright 2024 WWBT. All rights reserved.",
