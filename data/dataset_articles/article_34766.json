  "text": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, 2024 – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) today published the 2023 Pesticide Data Program (PDP) Annual Summary. The summary shows that more than 99 percent of the samples tested had pesticide residues below benchmark levels established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nEach year, USDA and EPA work together to identify foods to be tested on a rotating basis by the PDP. In 2023, tests were conducted on 9,832 samples from 21 commodities of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, and nuts. AMS partners with cooperating state agencies to collect and analyze pesticide residue levels on the selected food commodities.\nUSDA tests a wide variety of domestic and imported foods, with a strong focus on foods that are consumed by infants and children. EPA relies on PDP data to conduct dietary risk assessments and to ensure that any pesticide residues in foods remain at or below levels that EPA has set. The data also provide regulators, farmers, processors, manufacturers, consumers and scientists with important insights into the actual levels of pesticide residues found on widely consumed foods.\nThe annual pesticide residue results are reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EPA in monthly reports as testing takes place throughout the year. FDA and EPA are immediately notified if a PDP test discovers residue levels that could pose a public safety concern.\nThe 2023 data and summary can be found on the Pesticide Data Program page of the AMS website. Inquiries may be addressed to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, Science and Technology Program, Monitoring Programs Division by e-mail at amsmpo.data@usda.gov .\nFor more information about pesticides and food, please visit the EPA website and the FDA website.",
