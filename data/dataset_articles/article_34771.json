  "text": "The University of Connecticut (UConn) has partnered with Wells Fargo to improve career trajectories and work environments for neurodivergent individuals.\nA substantial $3.75 million investment will establish the Wells Fargo Center for Neurodiversity and Inclusive Employment at UConn, offering free educational workshops for corporate leaders on neurodiversity and effective supportive practices in the workplace. The initiative will emphasize community connections by partnering with organizations that support job seekers and will gather data on the effects of neurodiversity programs in businesses.\nJudy Reilly, executive director of UConn’s Center for Neurodiversity and Employment Innovation, said in a press release, “Wells Fargo’s willingness to share their real-world industry expertise to create — and deliver at no cost — education for corporate America that’s grounded in academic and research excellence is unheard of in this field. … [It] enables UConn to blend academic instructional design and research with real-world industry application and expertise to create solutions.” Workshops began earlier this year.",
