  "text": "The Ohio State University College of Dentistry is playing a key role in addressing one of the state’s most pressing health care challenges: access to dental care in underserved areas.\nThrough its Commitment to Access Resources and Education (CARE) Program, the college is training the next generation of dental professionals to improve oral health outcomes in communities with the greatest needs. By fostering partnerships, mentoring, and offering financial support, the CARE Program aims to increase the number of dental practitioners in areas experiencing a shortage, while simultaneously shaping new health care leaders who are committed to public service.\nThe challenge of improving oral health in Ohio, particularly in underserved areas, is substantial. According to data from KFF (formerly the Kaiser Family Foundation), Ohio has 162 designated dental Health Professional Shortage Areas.— a federal designation for a region with lack of health practitioners — requiring approximately 333 additional dentists to meet the state’s needs. The CARE Program is designed to address this gap by preparing dental students to return to these communities after graduation and provide much-needed services.\nStarting in the first year of dental school, CARE students commit to a public health-focused curriculum that includes monthly extracurricular meetings, mentorship opportunities, and hands-on community engagement. Participants plan to practice in shortage areas, particularly in practices that accept Medicaid or offer sliding-scale fees based on income.\nOne of the program’s key components is financial support. Each CARE student is eligible for a $10,000 scholarship, renewable annually for up to four years. This helps offset the cost of graduate dental education, encouraging students to pursue careers in public health and service-oriented dental care without the burden of excessive debt.\nIn addition, CARE students benefit from a rich array of professional development opportunities. They work closely with faculty, engage with local practitioners in their home communities, and participate in service projects. Guest speakers, including representatives from the Ohio Dental Association, offer practical advice on managing student loans and navigating loan forgiveness programs designed for health care professionals working in underserved regions.\nStudents are also encouraged to work with initiatives such as the Ohio Partnership to Improve Oral Health through Access to Needed Services (OPTIONS) program, a state partnership designed to connect Ohio adults who are uninsured or unable to afford dental care with volunteer dentists who provide discounted or free care.\nCARE’s mission extends beyond traditional clinical training. By fostering a sense of responsibility toward underserved populations, the program equips students with the skills and knowledge to address broader social determinants of health. This includes developing solutions to challenges faced by vulnerable groups, such as patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities or those requiring palliative care.\nUltimately, the CARE Program’s goal is to cultivate a new generation of dental professionals who are not only highly skilled but also deeply committed to serving the public. By feeding into broader initiatives like the OPTIONS program, CARE students are well positioned to be leaders in advancing oral health care access across the state.",
