Regularly eating grapes can fight off the impacts of a fast food diet, researchers say.\nPacked with chemicals that enhance gut bacteria, lower cholesterol, and loaded with antioxidants that reduce inflammation , grapes slash the risk of heart disease and cancer , reports Surrey Live . Dr John Pezzuto from Western New England University in the States remarked: \"It adds an entirely new dimension to the old saying &apos;you are what you eat.&apos;\"\nGrapes even alter gene expression, noted the pharmaceuticals professor. Dr Pezzuto, with over 600 research papers to his name, observed: \"That is truly remarkable.\"\nReduce cholesterol naturally as doctors highlights two alternatives to statins Three facial signs of high cholesterol you shouldn&apos;t ignore, doctor warns In experiments, mice feasted on a high-fat western diet but also got a daily grape powder dose equivalent to a punnet. These mice showed less fatty liver and outlived their counterparts.\nA third study found that, in addition to their other benefits, grapes can also aid in weight loss (Image: GETTY) Dr Pezzuto pointed out: \"The change observed in the study would correspond to an additional four to five years in the life of a human.\"The team also discovered grapes boost neuron function, offering a shield against Alzheimer&apos;s. They improved behaviour and cognition in mice, which was otherwise hampered when fed high-fat diets minus the grape extract.\nCutting one food from your diet will help lower cholesterol and blood pressure Six little-known signs in your legs of high cholesterol A third study found that, in addition to their other benefits, grapes can also aid in weight loss by boosting metabolism. Specifically, they may help prevent Alzheimer&apos;s disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both of which have been linked to consuming junk food.\nDr. Pezzuto stated: \"The adverse response was diminished by grape intervention. Life-long survival was also enhanced. These results suggest the potential of dietary grapes to modulate gene expression, prevent oxidative damage, induce fatty acid metabolism, ameliorate NAFLD and increase longevity when co-administered with a high-fat diet.\"\nLiver disease is a growing global issue due to unhealthy eating habits. Dr. Pezzuto added: \"The life-long addition of grapes to a high-fat diet increases longevity. \"These data illustrate the extraordinary influence of nutrigenomics, a burgeoning field of investigation that will augment our appreciation of diet and health .\n\"\"Recent research also found that eating grapes reduces the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.\nStory Saved You can find this story in My Bookmarks.
