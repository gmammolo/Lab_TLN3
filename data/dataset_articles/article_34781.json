  "text": "Dr Eric Berg DC recently revealed how incorporating two tablespoons of a 'superfood' into your nightly routine could improve blood sugar levels. The health whizz, who's an ace at healthy ketosis and intermittent fasting, boasts a YouTube subscriber count of 12.7 million. In one of his videos, he advised his viewers to mix apple cider vinegar with water before hitting the sack for significant reductions in blood sugar . This concoction is typically available at your local supermarket or chemist. Dr Berg, at the onset of his video, pointed to the rampant issue of blood sugar irregularities . \"There are so many people with blood sugar issues,\" he stated. Health warning as two 'fruits' can cause blood sugar to 'skyrocket' and cause 'serious' health issues Two key superfoods lower blood sugar without needing insulin, experts say Blood glucose, also known as blood sugar, is the primary sugar present in our blood and fuels our bodies, derived from the food we consume. It’s largely transformed into glucose and then pumped around in the bloodstream. As blood glucose goes up, the pancreas gets busy releasing insulin. For those without diabetes, normal blood sugar levels float between 4 to 6 mmol/L prior to meals and should be kept below 8 mmol/L a couple of hours post-meal, reports Surrey Live . High blood sugar commonly stems from not enough insulin being made or the body not responding to it properly. This condition can herald the arrival of type 2 diabetes, as reported by the Mirror. Groundbreaking diet 'could mean people with diabetes can stop medication' Type 2 diabetes: The little-known sign that could mean you're at risk Dr Berg recommends an additional step - incorporating apple cider vinegar into your diet. \"If you're not already, you should consider adding apple cider vinegar (ACV) into your diet,\" he suggests. \"There are things that can improve your blood sugar levels that go beyond keto and fasting, and apple cider vinegar is one of them.\" He highlights the benefits of its acetic acid content. \"The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar gives a very potent anti-glycemic effect, even if you're not doing keto. It can help buffer the food you eat to bring it lower on the glycemic index. This can help stabilise your blood sugar and insulin,\" Dr Berg explains. He also points out that lowering glucose reduces insulin, which can lead to several health benefits. Early signs of high blood sugar include increased thirst, frequent urination, headaches, and blurry vision. If left unchecked, symptoms can worsen to extreme fatigue, unexpected weight loss, skin or vaginal yeast infections, and slow healing of cuts or wounds. It's vital to consult with your GP or diabetes care team if these symptoms arise, as adjustments to your treatment plan or lifestyle may be necessary to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Dr Berg recommends going organic when it comes to apple cider vinegar. He advises, \"If your blood sugar is high in the morning even though you didn't consume a lot of carbs the day before, this is known as the dawn phenomenon.\" He suggests, \"If you experience this issue, try taking two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar mixed into eight to twelve ounces of water before bed.\" For those who hit the hay between 10-11pm, he says to have the drink from 9pm onwards. Dr Berg also suggests having apple cider vinegar before meals but cautions that its high acidity means it should be sipped through a straw to protect your teeth and always diluted in a tall glass of water – never taken neat to avoid stomach irritation or tooth enamel damage. Additionally, apple cider vinegar might lower blood sugar too much if you're on diabetes medications, so consult your doctor before upping your intake.",
