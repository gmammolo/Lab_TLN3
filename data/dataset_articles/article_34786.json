  "text": "In a landmark initiative to address rising suicide cases in Pakistan, psychiatrists and geneticists have launched the first collaborative genetic study to investigate the underlying causes of suicide in the Thar region and the surrounding districts. The study project aims to understand the genetic, psychological and environmental factors contributing to the suicides in rural Sindh, where their cases have increased alarmingly. In this regard a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed on Thursday by the Sindh Mental Health Authority (SMHA), the Department of Genetics at the University of Karachi, and the Department of Psychiatry at the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS). The MoU signing ceremony held in the KU Vice Chancellor Conference Room was attended by KU VC Prof Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi, SMHA Chairman Senator Dr Karim Ahmed Khawaja, DUHS Registrar Dr Ashar Afaq, and several other prominent faculty and health officials. Dr Iraqi emphasised that this pioneering research has the potential to uncover genetic predispositions to mental health conditions like depression and substance abuse that might increase susceptibility to suicide. Dr Khawaja expressed the urgency for the project, noting that the SMHA has documented a rise in suicide cases in Tharparkar, Jamshoro, Dadu and other districts, with the trend raising concerns over mental health in these communities. “This initiative is a milestone for Pakistan. Suicide is a complex issue, and understanding its genetic components will allow us to develop preventive measures to support affected communities.” Under the agreement, KU’s Department of Genetics will conduct DNA analyses and examine biological samples to identify genetic markers linked to mental health issues, the SMHA will assess mental health challenges within families, and the DUHS’s Department of Psychiatry will facilitate case identification and data collection from the affected communities. The three institutions will collaborate on a comprehensive survey and questionnaire, reaching out to families impacted by suicide in order to gather genetic samples and data. The significance of the project was highlighted by KU’s project coordinator and psychology department faculty member, Prof Dr Farah Iqbal, who pointed out the broad impact of suicide on families and communities, stressing that this research can help guide future interventions and mental health services. Prof Dr Maqsood Ali Ansari, chairperson of KU’s genetics department, expressed optimism that the research would help uncover root causes of suicides in Thar, and provide insights that can benefit public health policies across the country. Dr Washdev Amar, head of DUHS’s psychiatry department, said the Covid-19 pandemic had exacerbated mental health challenges globally, a trend also reflected in Sindh, where suicide cases in rural districts have seen significant spikes. He explained that understanding both genetic and environmental influences is critical to forming a holistic approach to suicide prevention. Prof Dr Musarrat Jahan Yousuf, dean of KU’s Faculty of Science, noted that comprehensive research like this might reveal further factors involved in suicidal tendencies, from genetic influences to social pressures. Dr Iraqi said that mental health is often overlooked, yet it is vital to a person’s overall well-being. He expressed hope that the collaborative efforts and shared resources from the three institutions would lead to valuable insights, guiding policies and resources to support mental health care in the country. The MoU was formally signed by Dr Khawaja, Dr Afaq and Dr Ansari, setting the foundation for a study poised to make substantial contributions to mental health research and preventive care in the country.
