  "text": "Hyunseong Jeong is running through the forest in‍ a trail running competition. ​She started running ​in 2018 and has ⁢become an iron woman⁣ who can easily complete ‌the 42.195km full marathon course as well as 100km trail running. ‌Provided by⁤ Hyunseong Jeong Office worker Jeong Hyeon-seong (31) ​started ‍running to lose weight in 2018. As the daughter ran hard, the father said, “Why‍ not try running‍ a full marathon?” In March 2019, he attempted the 42.195km full course for the first time at the Seoul Marathon‌ and Donga Marathon, ⁤and achieved ‘330’ (recorded‍ under 3 hours and 30 minutes) by ⁤recording 3 hours, 26 minutes and 51​ seconds.​ Ms. Jeong took third place in the 100km women’s division of‍ the Seoul 100K (Seoul⁢ International Ultra Trail Running Competition), ⁤which ended on the ⁤20th of last month. The ‌time was recorded at 18 hours, 17 minutes and 52 seconds on the course starting from Seoul Plaza and⁤ passing ​through Inwangsan Mountain, Bukaksan Mountain, Seoul Dullegil (Bukhansan Mountain, Dobongsan Mountain, Bulamsan Mountain, ⁤Achasan Mountain), Han River, and Cheonggyecheon Stream. Mr. Jeong is now attracting ⁣attention as a ⁤rising star in the trail running world.\n“When I was in⁣ college, no matter what‌ I did, I ⁢often felt like I was in a fog. The future isn’t certain. ⁢But when ‍it comes to running, you get results⁢ as much as you put in the effort. The distance is set, and if‍ you run any‌ distance without giving⁣ up, you can complete it. I ‍really liked that feeling. “As I ran, my thoughts changed positively.”\nYang Jong-gu, Deputy Director of Sports⁣ Department Ms. Jeong participated in the White Trail Inje 12km held in Inje-gun, Gangwon-do in January 2019 as training and took first place in ⁢the women’s division with a time of ‍1 hour, 20 minutes and 37 seconds.⁣ He even won on his first attempt at trail running. And in May of that year, I ⁤attempted my first⁤ 100km run at the TNF100 Korea Trail Running Competition ​and completed it in 24 hours\n“During my first 100km challenge, there ⁣were about 30km left and I couldn’t run. I had to walk ⁣because I had a problem with the iliotibial⁤ band ​in my left thigh. Because ​it was night, I turned on the head lantern and walked while looking at the ground. When I looked ⁤ahead, I saw a large​ mountain. Suddenly I started‍ vomiting. It felt like my body ‍was telling ​me it couldn’t go any further as I had ⁣to ​climb the ‍difficult uphill‍ again. ‍I quietly closed my eyes and rested for a while. Then I started again and eventually finished the race ​on foot. “At​ that ⁤moment, I felt like I had the whole world.”\nI fell in love⁣ with the fun⁣ of running up‍ the mountain. In the mountains, you can’t take your eyes off the running​ track. You have to be very tense. Because you could get hurt. I liked that tension. When climbing uphill, you can walk slowly and enjoy nature, including trees, flowers, streams, and‌ rocks. I‍ enjoyed the fun ​of⁤ running downhill at speed. Mr. Jeong expressed this by saying, ⁤“I‍ feel joy when ⁣I go downhill.” When running‌ 100km up a mountain, you⁤ must allocate your physical strength well considering ​the altitude and distance you will climb. It⁣ was also very interesting. ⁤The sense of accomplishment upon⁤ completing the race is indescribable.\nIn October 2019, I again completed⁤ 100km at the Trans ‍Jeju Trail Running Competition. Just when I was ‍getting a taste‌ for​ trail running, competitions⁣ disappeared due ⁤to the​ spread ⁤of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in‍ 2020, so I had to run alone. Although the competition was​ no longer held, there were no restrictions on running⁣ on mountains or roads.\nThe competition began again in ‌2022 and‍ participation began. While running 10 to 50 km, I completed ‍the Trans Jeju 100 km twice ⁣in ⁢a row until⁢ last‌ year. ⁣The best record⁤ for 100km was 16 hours, 24 ‌minutes and 18 seconds set last year.\nThis year, I won a place in​ major competitions. Wonju Trail Running WTR SALOMON GTNS ‍50km 3rd place (8 ⁣hours 32⁤ minutes 28 seconds), 1st Daegwallyeong ⁣Trail Run 42km 3rd place (5 hours 26 minutes 11 seconds), ROKA Trail ‍Running ​10.1 miles (about 16.3km) 2nd place ( 2⁣ hours 8 minutes 40 seconds), and took third place in the Seoul 100K 100km.\n“I was a little⁣ disappointed during the Seoul​ 100K this year. I could⁤ have reduced it by an hour… . Due to muscle⁤ overuse, both hamstrings were damaged and I also had pain in my left knee. I taped it ⁤beforehand,‌ but it didn’t help. ‌I thought ‍I needed to⁣ prepare more thoroughly.”\nMr. Jeong, who runs every early morning, often⁢ does⁣ bodyweight training using his own body weight to prevent injuries. Build core muscles​ through squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks. I am also working hard to shorten ⁣my personal best​ record for ‌the full marathon course. Her personal best record is 3 hours, ‍21 minutes and 18‍ seconds ‌set at the Donga Marathon in ⁢March this year, and she is running with the goal of achieving a ‘single’ (under 3​ hours ⁣and ‍10 minutes). He said, “Even⁢ in the mountains, you have to be good at running on the roads to run well. “I increase my ‌speed on the road,” he said. When I asked him, ‘Aren’t you pushing your body too hard?’ he smiled brightly and said, “It’s the energy ​of my life.”\ngreat 0 dog I’m sad 0 dog I’m angry 0 dog I‌ recommend it dog Hot⁢ news now It sounds like you’re recounting an inspiring story about a trail runner who ⁣experienced significant challenges and triumphs in their running journey. The individual, ⁢Mr. Jeong, has not only completed multiple 100km races but has⁢ also achieved impressive⁢ records in various competitions despite ​facing⁤ injuries and‍ setbacks.\nFrom the struggles of overcoming physical pain and mental obstacles during long-distance runs to ​finding joy in the beauty of nature and the thrill of running‌ downhill, there’s⁤ a strong sense of passion and determination ⁣reflected​ in​ his experience. His commitment to training, ⁤including bodyweight exercises and‍ marathon preparation, coupled with a positive outlook on his running endeavors, ‌underscores the ⁣dedication⁢ it takes to excel in such demanding sports.\nMoreover, the narrative ​evokes a sense of resilience, as Mr.⁢ Jeong adapts to situations‌ like the COVID-19 pandemic by ‌continuing⁤ to run alone when competitions were ⁣canceled,⁢ showcasing a deep love for​ the activity ‍itself.\nHis drive ⁣to improve personal records and the exhilaration ‌he feels even when faced with challenges emphasizes⁢ the transformative power of sports and ⁢the personal growth ⁢that can come⁣ from pushing one’s ⁣limits.
