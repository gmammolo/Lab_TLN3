  "text": "Vitamin D is one of the most important⁤ micronutrients for our health . Maintaining adequate ⁢levels of this substance is essential for bone, cardiovascular and ⁤neurological health.‌ Because its⁢ function is mainly ‌to maintain‍ healthy bones, muscles‍ and nerves, support the immune system and help the body use a greater ​amount of calcium present ⁢in foods.\nVitamin D is fat-soluble, meaning it dissolves in fats and oils, being stored ⁣in ‌adipose tissues and the liver. It is synthesized in the skin thanks to ⁤the action of solar rays and can be ⁤obtained through food or⁤ supplements. It is an important vitamin: its deficiency⁢ can cause various complications.\nThe past November 2nd was World Vitamin D Day . ⁣We talked about its needs ‌and functions with‌ Dr. Begoña ⁣Ortiz Santodomingo, director of the Scientific Area of ​​Farmasierra.\nVitamin ‍D requires diet, yes, like others, but it’s unique because it also requires the sun to⁣ activate, right?\nFirst we need to clarify⁢ that,‌ despite its name, vitamin D is actually a hormone. The‌ human body can produce vitamin D when we are‌ exposed to the sun. This process is very important because, although it is true that we can also​ obtain vitamin D through‌ diet, with this own synthesis ‍we cover⁤ approximately 80% of our ⁣vitamin D ⁢needs.\nBut that much?‍ Does sun exposure really cover 80% ⁣of your vitamin D ‌needs?\nYes, sun exposure is the very effective method to synthesize vitamin⁤ D. Additionally, humans produce a form of⁤ vitamin D (cholecalciferol or vitamin D3) which ⁤is ⁣the⁢ most bioavailable form for​ our⁤ body.\nYet we Spaniards fail in terms‍ of vitamin‍ D. ‌The ANIBES study showed⁢ that 94% of the population⁢ aged between⁣ 10 and 75 consume less than 80% of the recommended⁤ dose The epidemiological‌ data on vitamin D ‌deficiency in Spain is ​surprising, especially considering that we live in a sunny​ country. In the Nordic countries, the⁢ population knows⁢ the ⁢importance of vitamin D, but they ​also know that they cannot rely on the sun as a source of ⁢vitamin D. Therefore, ‍it supplements the ​population ​with vitamin D, either‌ through the ⁤diet with enriched foods or​ through food supplements , thus ensuring vitamin D levels.\nBut does our ‍lifestyle help with⁣ this?\nIn Spain we⁤ rely on obtaining vitamin D through the sun‌ and do not insist on diet. But the​ reality⁤ is that our lifestyle, characterized by a sedentary lifestyle ‍and long periods of time⁢ indoors ‌(work, car,​ institutionalized elderly… etc.), ‌limits our ⁢exposure ‌to sunlight: and this is why ‌hypovitaminosis​ D data are worse than those observed⁤ in ⁤other ⁢countries. ⁤\nWho is at greater risk of⁤ suffering from vitamin D⁢ deficiency?\nPeople who expose themselves little to the sun are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. ⁢These are⁣ people who spend ‍a lot of time indoors, ⁢those who have a sedentary lifestyle, night⁤ workers, etc. The elderly are also a population at risk, as ‌with age the⁣ skin becomes​ less efficient in ⁣the production of vitamin D.‌ Furthermore, ⁢those who live ⁣in ⁣residences or long-term care ⁤centers usually have limited mobility and, therefore, less exposure ​to the sun and greater risk of deficit.\nAnd obese people…\nYes, they are risky too; even ​those with adequate sun exposure, as vitamin D ​is fatty⁤ in nature and can ‍become “trapped” in⁣ fat​ cells, ⁤decreasing available vitamin ‍D ⁤levels. Patients with chronic‍ diseases or those being treated with certain drugs (corticosteroids and anticonvulsants) ⁤that can interfere with the production or ⁤use of vitamin​ D in the body are also at risk.\nDo growing children‌ need more vitamin D? For children over one year of age, doses of ​600 IU per day of vitamin D are recommended. These needs can be met through moderate sun exposure ‌(playing outdoors)⁣ and⁣ a balanced diet that includes⁣ foods rich in vitamin D , like fatty⁤ fish.⁣ .,⁣ enriched eggs and ‌dairy products. But it is not ‍recommended to give vitamin D to children⁢ without​ doctor’s advice. ​It will always be the⁣ pediatrician who deems it​ necessary or not to supplement a child with vitamin D.\nAnd then also the children,​ right?\nChildren under 1 year old deserve special mention. ​This is a population​ with little or no exposure to ⁣the sun and ​its exclusive diet is, in many cases, breast milk which, being the⁣ best food for children, does not ⁣contain​ large quantities‍ of vitamin D.\nVitamin D has several important functions, such as supporting bone health or the immune system, but ​does it also help⁢ prevent disease? The ⁢first activity described for vitamin D‍ at the ⁤end ⁢of the 19th century, ⁣and therefore the best known, is the‌ action it‍ exerts on‍ the ​musculoskeletal‍ system, ⁢contributing ⁢to the strengthening of bones and ⁢muscles.‍ In recent years, the importance of vitamin D in the correct functioning of ‍the ⁢immune system has⁢ been​ defined, helping ⁣to reduce the ⁤risk of respiratory​ infections, autoimmune diseases and some​ types of cancer.\nWhat‍ other positive ‌effects does vitamin D have ​on the body?\nMore recentstudies⁤ also suggest that adequate levels of vitamin D help control‌ blood pressure and ‍reduce inflammation. ⁢Other studies suggest that vitamin D‍ improves insulin sensitivity,‌ which is very important in the ⁣development and evaluation of ‍diabetes.⁣ These results are very ​encouraging⁣ and​ should encourage us to take care of our ​vitamin D levels, mainly through a⁢ balanced ⁢diet, regular ⁣outdoor exercise and a healthy lifestyle.\nMany people don’t​ get enough vitamin D through sun exposure and diet. So do supplements work?\nIt ‍is true that there are segments of the population for⁣ which it is more⁣ difficult to maintain⁤ vitamin D ⁣levels: these are​ the at-risk populations we ⁤talked about earlier. In these cases, it is advisable to consult the doctor to monitor the patient’s‌ vitamin ‍D levels ⁤and, according to his ‌criteria, ⁤recommend a treatment to⁣ restore, and then maintain, ‌vitamin D⁢ levels.\nAmong these​ supplements we see that there is vitamin D2 and D3.⁤ How do they differ?\nWith both being a viable health option, vitamin D3 is usually‍ the​ choice due‍ to its greater⁣ potency and effectiveness. These two forms differ in their origin: vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) comes from foods ⁤of animal ⁣origin, while vitamin⁣ D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plant ‍sources. ⁣This is why‌ vegetarian or vegan patients⁤ usually prefer to⁤ be treated with vitamin D2 supplements.\nAnd what is better: drops, pills or ampoules?\nAll presentations have the same dose. It is the doctor ​who must recommend the dose and form​ based​ on the patient’s⁣ characteristics. ​When it comes to administering vitamin D, there are ⁤more convenient dosage forms. For example, oral solutions in children, always equipped with a reliable and accurate dosing system. In adults, solid oral forms are convenient and ensure accurate dosing. Administration ​in‌ tablets minimizes the‍ risk ​of medication errors described for liquid forms.\nSupplements for children too?\nVitamin D supplements can be very beneficial to the ​health⁢ of children, especially those who do not⁣ get enough vitamin D through ⁢diet and sun exposure. ‌However, ⁤it ⁢is⁣ essential to consult a pediatrician before starting any supplementation.\nwant to receive the best content to⁢ take care of⁢ your​ health and feel good?⁢ Sign up for⁣ our new ⁤one for free news .\nThe passage discusses the importance of vitamin D,⁣ its sources, and the ‌populations ‌at risk for deficiency. Here are some ⁣key points⁣ summarized:\nLifestyle Factors : Many ‌people have‍ sedentary lifestyles and ‌spend considerable time​ indoors, which limits their exposure to sunlight and can lead to hypovitaminosis D. This is particularly true in some‌ populations where vitamin D deficiency ‌rates are higher than in other‍ countries. At-Risk Populations : Certain groups are more ​susceptible to vitamin D deficiency: -⁤ Those ​who‍ have limited sun exposure (e.g., individuals⁤ who work ⁤indoors, night⁤ shift workers).\n⁤ – The elderly, whose skin becomes‍ less efficient⁢ at producing vitamin D as they age.\n⁤ – Individuals living in long-term care facilities, who often have restricted mobility.\n⁢ – Obese individuals,⁢ as vitamin D can get trapped in fat cells.\n‍ -​ Patients ​with chronic diseases or those taking medications (like corticosteroids) that affect vitamin D metabolism.\nChildren’s Needs : – Children over one year‍ require about 600 IU of vitamin D per day, which can be obtained through moderate sun exposure and a diet rich in vitamin D.\n– Infants under one ⁢year are at risk‍ as breast milk may not⁤ provide ⁢sufficient vitamin D.\nFunctions of Vitamin D : ⁣ – Supports bone health and muscle strength.\n– Plays a role in the immune system and may help reduce the ‍risk of ⁢respiratory infections, autoimmune diseases,⁤ and certain cancers.\n-‍ Recent studies indicate it may influence​ blood pressure ⁤regulation and improve insulin sensitivity.\nSupplementation : For those who struggle to maintain adequate vitamin ‌D levels through⁣ sunlight and diet, supplements⁢ may be recommended, especially for at-risk populations.​ It’s⁣ important to consult a healthcare⁤ provider for​ monitoring ​and recommendations. Types of Vitamin D : ‍ ⁣- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is preferred due to ⁣its potency and effectiveness; it is derived from animal sources.\n‌ ⁣ – Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) comes from plant sources and may be preferred by⁤ vegetarians or vegans.\nThese insights highlight the significance of ‍maintaining adequate vitamin D​ levels‍ for overall health and the need for increased awareness and proactive⁢ measures,‍ especially among vulnerable populations.",
