  "text": "“It is⁤ transcendental that women masturbate according to our desires and without complexes. The psychological and physical benefits are ​indisputable; More than enough reasons to talk openly ‌about a cultural taboo that makes no sense,” ⁣says Nayara Malnero Suárez, clinical psychosexologist.\nFemale masturbation , with desire and without ⁤complexes We tend to think that male masturbation is more natural than female masturbation. In ⁣fact, the former is socially better accepted than‍ the⁣ latter. It’s as if ⁢for ⁢men it was taken for granted, with‍ all the pressure that this issue entails, but for us⁤ it’s⁤ the opposite.\nSo ⁣much ⁢so that, in general, statistics say​ that men tend to masturbate from a young age and that many​ women start masturbating after starting shared sexual ⁣relations.\n<img decoding=\"async\" ⁤width=\"900\" ​height=\"516\" data-attachment-id=\"360342\" data-permalink=\"https://efesalud.com/masturbacion-femenina-deseo-sin-complejos/iria-efe/\" data-orig-file=\" data-orig-size=\"879,504\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1730828839\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\" data-image-title=\"NO USAR. ⁣Videoblog psicosexología: masturbación femenina.\" data-image-description=\" A young woman named Iria.\n“⁢ data-image-caption=”” data-medium-file=”‌ data-large-file=” ​class=”wp-image-360342 lazyload” style=”width: 900px;” ‌alt=”female masturbation.” ⁤src= ” ⁢srcset=” 879w, 300w, 768w” data-sizes=”auto” data-eio-rwidth=”879″ data-eio-rheight=”504″/>Nayara, what benefits does ⁤masturbation have for women’s health ?, asks Iria.\nMasturbation ⁢has multiple benefits ​for both sexes,⁣ especially for women, as⁤ it helps us ‌get ‍to know ourselves better, to know what ‌we like and what we don’t about our desires, ​sensations or learnings that we share with our partner.\nFurthermore, Masturbation generates numerous benefits for our ⁣health : it helps our skin, our hair, even our nails.\nAt the same time, it improves ‌our mood and self-esteem; It⁢ helps regulate our circadian rhythm, especially the sleep⁣ phase,⁤ one of⁢ the keys ⁣to our energy to endure and pace everyday activities.\nAnd, of course, female ‍masturbation makes us feel better about ourselves.\nAt the same time, ⁣it helps us ‌to ​enrich our relationships with others, to respect others more, ⁢to‌ be more equal… And, without a doubt,‌ to respect ourselves something that sometimes costs us a ‌lot at a social and family level.\n<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" ⁣height=\"555\" data-attachment-id=\"360346\" data-permalink=\"https://efesalud.com/masturbacion-femenina-deseo-sin-complejos/nayara-malnero-tu-psicosexologa-efe/\" data-orig-file=\" data-orig-size=\"668,412\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"1730827935\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"1\"}\" ⁤data-image-title=\"Videoblog psicosexología:‍ masturbación femenina.\" data-image-description=\"\nNayara Malnero Suárez, psychosexologist.\n” data-image-caption=”” data-medium-file=” data-large-file=” class=”wp-image-360346 lazyload” style=”width: 900px;” alt=”Female Masturbation.” src= ” srcset=” 668w, 300w” data-sizes=”auto” data-eio-rwidth=”668″ ⁣data-eio-rheight=”412″/>\nConclusion from Nayara, your​ psychosexologist : “Female masturbation is extremely beneficial to ⁤our being and our health. Whoever wants to enjoy it and obtain all these ⁣benefits; and anyone who doesn’t want to, obviously, has no ⁣obligation to do so… ‍And remember, sex ​should always be free, healthy and safe, for⁢ both women and men.”\nEFEsalud launches its psychosexology video blog‍ with Nayara ‍Malnero Suarez psychologist, clinical ⁤sexologist and sex coach, relationship specialist, sex educator and therapist, ⁤as ‌well as ‍communicator. Interview between Time.News ​Editor ⁢and Nayara Malnero Suárez, Clinical​ Psychosexologist\nEditor: Welcome, Nayara. It’s a ⁢pleasure to have you here ⁣with‍ us to ⁢discuss an often-taboo topic—female masturbation. To start, why do ⁤you believe it’s important for women‌ to explore their ⁤own⁢ desires?\nNayara Malnero Suárez: Thank you for having me. It’s essential for women to embrace their desires without shame⁣ or complexes. Masturbation is a powerful tool for self-discovery —it teaches us ⁢what ‍we like ‌and dislike, enhancing‌ our ‍overall sexual wellness. This‌ not only benefits⁤ our personal life but also helps cultivate better relationships with partners.\nEditor: That’s ‍intriguing! You mentioned self-discovery. How ​does this process⁢ impact a woman’s mental‍ and emotional health?\nNayara: Masturbation can significantly improve mood and boost self-esteem. It releases endorphins, the feel-good​ hormones, which can ⁢lift⁣ spirits and reduce stress. Additionally, it regulates circadian rhythms, aiding sleep quality—an often-overlooked aspect of ​our well-being. Feeling good about oneself can enhance interactions with others and‌ foster respect, equality, and ultimately, ⁢self-respect.\nEditor: Interesting insights! You’ve⁤ pointed out that ⁢societal perceptions tend to normalize⁣ male masturbation while stigmatizing female experiences. Can you elaborate on this disparity?\nNayara: Absolutely. There’s a ⁢significant double standard. Men are socially encouraged to express their sexuality openly, while women⁢ often face judgment and taboo around the same behaviors. This cultural disparity can lead women to‌ begin their exploration only in the context⁣ of shared sexual relations, rather ⁣than ​independently. We ⁢need to dismantle these archaic notions and recognize that pleasure⁣ is natural for everyone.\nEditor: It sounds like changing the conversation around ⁣this topic is crucial.‍ What advice would you give to⁢ women who may feel reluctant to‌ explore their own bodies?\nNayara: I would encourage them to approach the topic with curiosity rather than shame.​ Masturbation ⁣is a self-care practice that ‌offers joy and autonomy.​ Start by ‍creating a comfortable environment, free from⁢ distractions, and take ⁢your time to explore what feels good. ⁣It’s essential to understand that this journey ‌is personal and unique ⁤to each ⁤individual.\nEditor: ‍Let’s shift gears ⁣a⁢ bit. You mentioned physiological‍ benefits ‌of masturbation, including impacts on skin, ⁣hair, ‍and even nails. Can⁣ you explain⁣ those⁢ connections a bit more?\nNayara: Certainly!​ The physiological ‍benefits arise from increased blood circulation resulting from arousal and orgasm. ⁢This improved circulation can ‍enhance⁢ skin health,⁤ giving it a natural glow, and promote hair and⁢ nail ​growth. It’s ​a holistic approach to ‍wellness—something many might⁣ not consider but is very impactful.\nEditor: Fascinating! Given the cultural taboos surrounding female masturbation, what steps can society take to promote healthier ‍discussions and educational practices regarding⁢ this subject?\nNayara: Open dialogues ⁣are key. Education ‌should begin early, breaking down misinformation ⁣and stigma surrounding female sexuality. We should advocate for inclusive sexual health​ education in schools, empowering⁣ individuals with knowledge. Furthermore,⁤ creating safe spaces—online or offline—for women to share⁢ experiences without⁣ fear⁣ of judgment‌ is vital.\nEditor: Thank you, Nayara. Your insights shed light ⁤on a topic‍ that affects many yet remains hidden under societal pressure. ‌It’s clear we need to⁢ embrace healthier perspectives‍ on female pleasure ‍and​ self-exploration.\nNayara: ‌ Thank you for the opportunity to discuss this ‍important topic. It’s time we celebrate female sexuality and encourage women to take charge of their desires and well-being.",
