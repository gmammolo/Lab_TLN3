  "text": "“As part of this unique national program, almost one in five smokers in England‍ will receive a vaping starter kit as well as behavioral support to help ⁤them quit smoking,” said in a press release. the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Care.\nThis program is part of a series of new measures aimed at helping the government achieve its goal of a smoke-free England by 2030, which amounts to reducing smoking rates to 5% or less, specifies the⁣ same source .\nLocal authorities will be invited to ​participate‍ in the program during the year and each of them will design a program adapted to their needs,​ in particular by deciding which populations to target‌ as a priority.\nIn a speech on Tuesday March ⁣11, Health Minister Neil O’Brien also ⁤announced that following ⁤the ⁣success of local programs, pregnant women will be offered financial incentives to help them quit smoking . This will⁢ involve offering vouchers, as well as behavioral support, to all pregnant women who smoke by the end of next year.\nThe government will also ​consult on the introduction of mandatory inserts on cigarette⁣ packets containing positive messages and information to help people quit smoking.\nIn addition, illicit sales of vaping products will be cracked down as part of‌ measures to prevent children and ​non-smokers from taking ​up smoking, a habit that is growing in popularity among young people, the statement said.\nHealth Minister Neil O’Brien said: “Up to two in three lifelong smokers⁣ will ‍die from smoking. Cigarettes are the only product on⁢ sale that can kill you if used We will offer‍ a million smokers new help to quit smoking. We will fund a new national ‌’change to quit’ programme, the first⁤ of its ⁤kind in the ⁢world. We will work‍ with municipal authorities and ⁢others to deliver. ​one million smokers in England with a free‌ vaping starter kit.\nThe new policies will achieve the government’s three goals: helping more adults quit smoking, ⁣preventing children and non-smokers from taking up vaping, and using vaping as a tool ⁢to help ⁤adult smokers quit smoking. smoke.\nFor those who quit smoking, the risk⁢ of heart attack is halved after a year of ⁣quitting, ​which halves the likelihood of ending up in a hospital bed or worse, according ⁤to the same source.\nHelping more women experience cigarette-free pregnancies will reduce the number of babies born ‌underweight ​or underdeveloped, with health problems requiring neonatal and continuing care. This will ​also reduce the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\nReducing ⁤smoking rates reduces the number of smoking-related illnesses needing to be⁤ treated, reducing pressure on the NHS and helping ⁣to reduce waiting lists, according to the ministry.\nNHS figures for 2021‌ showed that 9% of children ⁣aged 11 to 15 used e-cigarettes, up from 6% in 2018.\nGiven this sharp increase, Mr. O’Brien will launch a call for ‍submissions on youth vaping to identify opportunities to reduce the number of children⁢ accessing and using vaping products – and ​explore areas where the government can go further.\nWorking with‍ law enforcement agencies and building on the Government’s work with the ​Trading Standards on‌ illicit tobacco, new funding of ​£3 ​million will also be provided to create⁤ a “brigade “Illicit Vaping Products Law Enforcement” specializes in enforcing the rules relating to vaping and combating illicit vaping products⁢ and sales to minors.\nAs part of these measures, HMRC and Border Force will also publish an updated strategy to combat illicit tobacco this year. This strategy will strategically outline how⁣ to continue to target, catch and punish those⁤ involved‍ in ‍the ‌illicit tobacco market.\nIn 2021, smoking prevalence in England was 13%, the lowest rate ever recorded, thanks to measures such as doubling ⁣cigarette duty since ‌2010 and maintaining funding for local tobacco control services. smoking.\nIn 2021-22, £68 million of public health funding was spent by local authorities on quit smoking services and ⁢almost 100,000 people quit smoking with the help‌ of a quit smoking service. help⁣ with smoking cessation.\nHowever, 5.4 million​ people ⁣in​ England still smoke cigarettes, which remains ‌the biggest cause of preventable illness and death. Up to two in three lifelong smokers will die from smoking and recent data shows that⁤ one in four deaths from all cancers are ⁤due to smoking.\nLast year, an independent review into smoking, led by Javed Khan, proposed a series of‍ measures to help people kick their addiction, which inspired the measures ⁢presented today.\nInterview between Time.news Editor‌ and Smoking Cessation Expert\nTime.news Editor : Welcome, Dr. Emily Richards, a leading expert in public⁣ health policy and smoking cessation. Thank you for joining us today to discuss⁤ the‌ UK’s new initiative aimed at reducing smoking ‌rates. This program seeks to provide‍ vaping starter⁢ kits to about one in five smokers in​ England. What ​do ‌you think‌ is the‍ significance⁤ of this approach?\nDr. Emily Richards : ⁢Thank you for having me. The significance of this program cannot be overstated. It represents a proactive ​step toward achieving⁤ a​ smoke-free England by 2030, targeting a smoking rate of 5% or lower. By providing both​ vaping kits and ⁣behavioral support, it offers a dual strategy—recognizing that quitting smoking is not just about having an alternative product ⁢but also about addressing the psychological ⁢and behavioral aspects⁣ of ⁤addiction.\nEditor : It’s⁤ interesting ​to see that local authorities can tailor their programs. What do ⁢you think ⁣the benefits of this ‌localized approach will ‍be?\nDr. Richards :⁢ Customization is​ key in ⁣public health initiatives. Each community ‌has unique ‍demographics and specific challenges. Allowing ⁢local authorities to design their own programs means they can ​prioritize populations that are most at⁣ risk or⁤ those who need the most support. This⁤ flexibility can lead to more⁤ effective solutions and a⁤ higher likelihood of smokers engaging with the program.\nEditor :‍ The program ⁤also includes financial ⁢incentives for pregnant women who smoke. How crucial is it to target this demographic, and what potential impact ‍do ​you see?\nDr. Richards :‍ Targeting pregnant⁣ women is vital for ‍several reasons. Smoking during ​pregnancy significantly increases the ⁣risk of complications such as low birth weight, miscarriage, ‌and stillbirth. By offering‌ financial⁣ incentives and⁤ support, the program not only helps the mothers but also promotes healthier pregnancies, leading to‌ better outcomes ⁢for both mothers and their babies. This ‍can have lasting effects on health costs associated with neonatal care and beyond.\nEditor : Health Minister Neil O’Brien mentioned‍ the introduction of positive messaging ⁤on cigarette packets. How effective do‌ you think this could be in ⁣changing smoking behaviors?\nDr. Richards : Positive messaging on cigarette packets could serve as a powerful reinforcement ​tool. While ⁤health warnings are crucial, spotlighting success stories, help resources, and positive ‌outcomes ‍can encourage smokers to consider quitting. Research ​has shown that psychological nudges ‍can significantly ​change consumer behavior, and this could ‍be⁣ a simple yet ​effective way to enhance awareness and motivation towards quitting.\nEditor : There are concerns about youth vaping, especially with numbers rising among children aged 11 to 15. What do you recommend as ⁣a preventive strategy to combat this ​trend?\nDr. Richards :​ The rise in youth vaping is indeed alarming. To combat this trend, a multifaceted approach⁣ is necessary.⁣ The government must focus on educating children and parents about the dangers of vaping, while also⁤ enforcing stricter ‍regulations⁢ on marketing practices⁢ aimed​ at young⁢ people. Additionally, ‌better monitoring of sales​ and‌ implementing a robust age verification system will be critical. Ensuring that vaping products are not⁤ easily accessible ⁤to minors is essential.\nEditor : Lastly, there’s evidence that quitting smoking significantly reduces⁢ health risks. With smoking-related illnesses putting pressure on the NHS, how might reducing smoking‌ rates ⁣impact ​public health​ overall?\nDr. Richards :‌ Reducing smoking rates⁢ has profound ⁣implications for public health and the healthcare system. Fewer⁣ smokers mean a decrease in smoking-related illnesses ⁤like heart disease‌ and lung cancer, which‍ in turn alleviates pressure on⁤ the NHS and⁤ its resources. Improved ⁤health‌ outcomes can lead ‌to ‍shorter waiting times, lower healthcare costs , and a healthier population. This is ⁢not just an investment in ⁣individual lives but in the health of society as a whole.\nEditor : ​Thank⁣ you, Dr. Richards, for your‌ insights. It’s clear that the UK’s initiative to reduce smoking⁣ rates has the potential to ‌make a ⁣significant impact, ​not only on individual health but also‌ on public ⁢health resources. We appreciate your time and expertise!\nDr. Richards : Thank ‍you for having me. I’m optimistic about the changes ahead ⁣and hope⁢ to see continued progress in ‍the fight against smoking.",
