  "text": "Dr. Megan Gilmore performs both general and bariatric surgeries. CHI St. Joseph’s Health recently expanded its surgical services in Park Rapids. Sonja Day, communication/marketing manager for the hospital, explained that an “ICU wing has been converted to our own general surgery clinic, and Dr. Megan Gilmore is our very first surgeon.” ADVERTISEMENT Gilmore performs both general surgery – for example, colonoscopies, appendectomies, hernia, reflux or gallbladder surgeries – and bariatric surgeries. Previously, CHI St. Joseph’s Health contracted surgeons with other organizations, “but now we employ our own surgeon as well as the anesthesiologists.” This is particularly beneficial, she added, since there’s an older population in Hubbard County and they may not have transportation to another town. An open house was held for hospital employees on Wednesday, Nov. 6. The remodeled wing has five consultation rooms and a nurses’ station. “It’s great to have her do different kinds of surgeries for the community. It’s so exciting,” Day said. “We have our primary care clinic downstairs, so if they need a referral to a surgery, they can have it done here.” Gilmore worked for Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato for 12 years prior to moving to Park Rapids. Her first day was Oct. 31. While in Mankato, she built up the clinic’s minimally invasive surgery and bariatrics programs. “It’s what I enjoy doing – building practices,” Gilmore said. “Most of the surgeries I do are minimally invasive, laparoscopic or robotic.” ADVERTISEMENT Gilmore noted weight loss surgery has been available at the hospital since 2001. “If someone has had surgery, I’m happy to see them and do their long-term followup, because those are patients we typically see for life.” For more information, call 218-616-3800.
