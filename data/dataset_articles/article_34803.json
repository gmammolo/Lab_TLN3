  "text": "In This Story\nAssociate Professor in the School of Nursing Katherine Scafide appointed to the inaugural American Academy of Forensic Sciences Standards Board Forensic Nursing Consensus Body.\nKatherine Scafide, associate professor in the School of Nursing, has been appointed a founding member of the Forensic Nursing Consensus Body (CB) of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences Standards Board (ASB). Scafide and a dedicated team will collaborate to advance national forensic nursing standards.\n“It is an honor to be a part of the first Forensic Nursing Consensus Body and to elevate the field of forensic nursing, fueled by the shared passion among my colleagues,” said Scafide.\nThe American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) is a multidisciplinary professional organization that advances science and its application to the legal system. Consensus Bodies focus on establishing forensic standards in specific disciplines. Each body is dedicated to the widespread formulation, adoption, and enforcement of recognized standards.\nThe Forensic Nursing Consensus Body will be responsible for developing, reviewing, and voting upon standards, guidelines, technical reports, and best practice recommendations in this discipline of forensic science.\nScafide’s revolutionary research in alternate light source and bruise detection is pioneering inclusivity, justice, and equity for domestic violence survivors of color. Her unique expertise stems from 20 years of experience in forensic nursing practice and research.\nCongratulations Dr. Scafide!",
