  "text": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is a true believer, even more liberal than her predecessor Andrew Cuomo. Earlier this year, when she heard about Florida's \"disgraceful and dangerous\" six-week abortion ban, she assured Floridians that New York would be their \"safe harbor\" where they could get an abortion at any time for any reason. News flash: People are fleeing New York and moving to Florida because they can't take it anymore. Hochul put out a graphic of the actions the governor's office was taking to protect the fundamental freedoms of New Yorkers, such as the right to bear arms. OK, we're just kidding about this one; instead, she brags about New York's gun control laws. And as far as protecting abortion access, the state is \"stockpiling abortion medication\" so they'll have plenty of \"medication\" on hand when Donald Trump bans the abortion pill in his nationwide abortion ban. New York is the birthplace of the women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental justice, and American labor movement. We have always been a bastion for rule of law and for freedom — and we always will be. — Governor Kathy Hochul (@GovKathyHochul)[pic.twitter.com/ivFiuNDMum][November 7, 2024] New York will always be a bastion of freedom. Your state officials just raided a man's house, confiscated his rescue pets and then murdered them under these 'freedom laws,' you're so proud of. — Chad Felix Greene 🇮🇱 (@chadfelixg)[November 7, 2024] She never said anything about the freedom to keep a pet squirrel in your house. Fundamental Freedoms? — Meredith (@Opportunitweet) The NY government violated civil rights by shutting businesses, closing places of worship and schools, and denying families access to society if one or all of them didn't get an injection. This is Hochul's NY legacy.[November 7, 2024] You threw a guy in prison for POSTING MEMES that he DIDN'T EVEN CREATE. — Rochester Radar (@RochesterRadar) Don't you DARE talk about ANYONE'S freedoms. Witch.[November 7, 2024] Didn't you guys just do a raid on a squirrel? Maybe a little more focus on subway crime, yes? — old_jester (@old_jester1968)[November 7, 2024] And let’s not forget out of control CRIME and cashless bail laws — Isaac Reshad (@ReshadIsaac)[November 7, 2024] God go away already, literally no one elected you — screamingnance73 (@GeeEmm73)[November 7, 2024] Glad to see yall are learning nothing from this. Should bode well for my side in a couple of yesrs — SCIENCE!! (@RaschDecisions)[November 7, 2024] Usually I like to tell you to cut the crap, but I think you should keep going. Keep digging your own hole. We'll throw your ass in it in 2026. Make sure it's big enough for you and Tish!! — Amy (@Queendom916)[November 7, 2024] Your dumb shit gun control is yet another thing pushing people farther right. The majority of Americans don't have \"ban guns\" as a priority. — Mildly Annoyed Red Guy (@LifeDtf) Way to be out of touch. \"nation-leading gun laws\" my ass.[November 7, 2024] Anything on keeping criminals out of the streets? — JediofTatuin (@JediofTatuin)[November 7, 2024] Hochul is very concerned about the fundamental freedoms of criminals. This list is exactly why Trump won. Not too bright doubling down on it. — 🇺🇸🦋demogirl🦋🇺🇸 (@demogirl17) “Stockpiling abortion medication” Just WOW[November 7, 2024] \"Abortion medication\" — that's even more disingenuous than calling abortion \"female health care.\" ***",
