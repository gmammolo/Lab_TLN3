Davide Angelini – stock.adobe.com On every question, women answered that they were more satisfied with their lives than males did.\nIs marriage good for your mental health? Shocking study reveals how having a spouse impacts happiness\nThey were happier being on their own, less likely to want a significant other, more sexually satisfied and more content overall.\nThe aggregated data suggested that women — whether solo or plus-one — are more pleased with their lives in general, not to mention more satisfied sexually.\nAnd no — they don’t want you to put a ring on it.\n‘Date a Dem’ speed dating event in NYC sabotaged by ‘unhinged’ Trump supporter\nAccording to Hoan and MacDonald, women are happier being single because they are more likely to have supportive platonic relationships to fall back on.\nOn every question, women answered that they were more satisfied with their lives compared to men.
