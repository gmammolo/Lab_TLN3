  "text": "CALDWELL – Students, faculty and staff at Mount St. Dominic Academy marked Breast Cancer Awareness Month at recent events.\nThe entire school wore pink and gathered for a photo in the shape of a breast cancer ribbon on Friday, Oct. 18.\nThen, on Monday, Nov. 4, the Mount Against Cancer club hosted a student-led assembly about breast cancer and highlight the club’s accomplishments and upcoming initiatives.\nThe keynote speaker was Sr. Fran Sullivan, a former head of school at the Mount and a 20-year breast cancer survivor. Sullivan, a proud alumna of the Class of 1960, shared her journey of dedication to education and her personal experiences as a breast cancer survivor. She emphasized the “profound” impact of the Mount community’s generosity in supporting cancer research and encouraged everyone to continue their efforts.\nFollowing Sullivan’s speech, senior Mary Hladik of West Caldwell presented a slew of statistics related to cancer.\nShe asked attendees who had received a sticker when entering the theater for the assembly to stand as a visual representation of the percentage of people likely to face a cancer diagnosis in their lifetime.\n“While this is just the Mount population, 39.5 percent of people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives,” she said, urging the audience to reflect on the significance of these numbers.\nMount Against Cancer focuses on raising awareness and funds for the American Cancer Society. Senior Jayden DeSilva of Verona showed off its new space-themed t-shirt, symbolizing the club’s goal to “send cancer out of this world.”\nThe Mount will host its “Spike for a Cure” game against Seton Hall Prep on Tuesday, Nov. 12. Senior Nyah Adiedo of West Orange encouraged those in the audience to participate as this year’s goal is to surpass last year’s $1,400 fundraising total.\nJunior Bridget Mulvihill of West Caldwell highlighted future events planned, including Cookies for a Cure bake sale and a spring kickball tournament, and invited students to get involved by volunteering, forming teams and purchasing merchandise for the tournament.\n“Your support makes a huge difference in making our events successful,” she said.\nSenior Kate Wohlgemuth of North Caldwell encouraged students, faculty and staff to stay updated with the club’s happenings through its Instagram account with the handle @mount_against_cancer.\nFellow senior Maddie Natale of Little Falls expressed her gratitude on behalf of the club for the school community’s support and ongoing involvement in the fight against cancer.\n[CLICK HERE TO DONATE AND SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM](https://newsweneed.org/donations/njhills2)",
