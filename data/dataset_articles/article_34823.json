The event, part of the Extra Life program benefiting Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, will take place on November 9-10, 2024, at Cirrus Logic’s headquarters in Austin.\nSince 2016, Cirrus Logic employees have raised over $131,000 for Dell Children’s Medical Center through Extra Life. This year, the team has set an ambitious goal of $20,000, pushing their cumulative contribution to more than $150,000 this year.\n“It’s inspiring to see all of the different ways Cirrus employees come together to make a difference in our community,” said Denise Grodé, Chief Human Resources Officer, Cirrus Logic. “For the annual Extra Life event, our employees leverage their playful spirit and passion for gaming to make a real difference in children’s lives.
