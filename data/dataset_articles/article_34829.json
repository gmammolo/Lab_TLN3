  "text": "Backpacking tents tend to be tighter on space to save on weight. But sometimes, some extra headspace makes it a lot easier to change clothes, play games, or generally live more comfortably. I am only 5’3″, so I find most tents spacious enough. My boyfriend, on the other hand, is 6’2″ and always appreciates a little extra space. Sometimes, it’s worth the extra weight. The NEMO Aurora 2 tent is listed on NEMO’s website as a backpacking tent, though it verges on a car camping tent. In terms of weight and bulk, it’s right on the line.\nMy boyfriend and I spent last fall using it in Hawaii and Indiana together. We have used it for the whole summer, road-tripping throughout Michigan. This fall, we’ll continue to use it in Indiana in various state parks. We’ve slept in wind, rain, and under oak trees, dropping acorns like hail.\nIf you prioritize spaciousness, it’s worth the weight penalty on the backpacking trail — especially if you can split it up between two people. As someone who often backpacks and camps by car, having a tent that can double for both is ideal.\nIn short: The NEMO Aurora 2 tent ($300) is a great tent for one or two people who love to camp and backpack and want plenty of room for extra comfort. It has massive doors, vestibules, and vertical walls that make it very spacious. It uses a PFAS-free and FR-chemical-free waterproof rainfly. A nearly all-mesh body provides excellent air circulation and ventilation. There are plenty of pockets for organization and storage, and the footprint is even included. If you’re looking for comfort, durability, and versatility within a budget, the NEMO Aurora 2 tent is a fantastic choice.\nIf you’re shopping for backpacking tents, compare the NEMO Aurora 2 to the others in our guide to the Best Backpacking Tents .\nNEMO Aurora 2 Tent check price at rei check price at nemo equipment Specs 2-Person: 3-Season: Minimum weight: 4 lbs., 11 oz.

This fall, we’re entering its third season of use. We also purchased the NEMO Roamer 2 sleeping pad , the NEMO Jazz double sleeping bag , and the NEMO Fillo King pillows to build out a full camping/sleeping kit for two.\nThis intent has seen a lot of camping over the last year, and it’s lived up to NEMO’s reputation for high-quality camping gear. We’ve been very pleased with it and the rest of our NEMO setup. However, even among the tents NEMO sells for backpacking, this one is on the bulkier and heavier side. We also have a NEMO Dagger tent that’s lighter and, in my opinion, better for backpacking.\nWhere the Aurora 2 has an edge over some of NEMO’s lighter backpacking tents is in its price. This tent is only $300, making it an affordable choice for a two-person backpacking tent. The NEMO Aurora 2 backpacking tent also comes in a three-person size, and there are two color options: Frost/Silt and Mango/Fog.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) Aurora 2 Set-Up Assembling this tent is straightforward and intuitive. It gets even faster when you do it often and become efficient.\nThe main pole is symmetrical, so you can easily attach it to whatever side you’re on. It is made of lightweight aluminum poles with a custom-forged hub. The grommets where it attaches are also metal and so far seem very durable.\nA smaller pole curves across the top holding out the mesh with tension and extending the sidewalls out. That’s where all the extra headroom comes from.\nAdditionally, once the rainfly is on, the tent stakes out wide offering large vestibules with lots of storage space. NEMO includes guy-out lines with the stakes for the rainfly.\nEasy setup and wide curved zipper; (photo/Xiaoling Keller)\nZippers & Pockets One of the standout features of this tent is the long, curved, continuous zipper of the door. I’ve used a continuous zipper before. But the curve wasn’t quite large enough, so it would get stuck, and it eventually broke.\nThis tent doesn’t seem to have that problem. The curve is long enough that the zipper smoothly glides in the grooves for easy in-and-out access.\nOnce you’re inside the tent, you’ll notice and appreciate the number of pockets. There are two long pockets on the ends, two deep pockets on the sides, and one “Nitelight” pocket for a headlamp up above that diffuses light. It makes it easy to organize your accessories and light the tent up when its dark out. It also has loops for a mini lantern or a string of lights.\nThe Aurora 2 is at home car camping and just light enough for backpacking; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) Materials & Colors The fabric is made of 68D polyester, which is ideal for keeping bugs out while allowing for plenty of airflow. Most of the tent body is mesh, so if both doors are looped back or the rainfly is off altogether, condensation is minimal and almost nonexistent. NEMO includes toggles so you can roll the rainfly or doors back and secure them in place.\nThe rainfly is made of PU polyester. Whether its waterproofing fails with age remains to be seen. We’ve only used this tent for 1 year. But from all of our use, it has maintained its waterproofing and kept us dry. When it gets water on it, the sun dries it out fairly quickly.\nSpacious interior and ample pockets make the NEMO Aurora 2 perfect for comfortable, organized camping; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) Weather Resistance We recently weathered a storm in this tent, and we’ll weather more as we get deeper into fall. It was pouring and extremely windy. Eventually, it stopped, and the wind blew all the water off our rainfly. But it wasn’t long before it started pouring again.\nThe inside of the tent stayed completely dry without any signs of leaking or letting moisture bleed through. The 2,000mm waterproof rating of the rainfly did its job.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) When we left, I had to pack the tent away wet. But the following morning, I just tied it to a pole and let it blow in the wind for about 20 minutes to dry it out sufficiently.\nSome online reviews have commented that the Aurora 2 doesn’t perform very well in high wind conditions. But in my experience, I found it to be sturdy and stable.\nRoom for Improvement My only gripe with this tent is its weight and bulk. It is marketed as a backpacking tent, but even on NEMO’s webpage for the Aurora 2, it recommends removing the poles “to share the weight with a friend.” This isn’t to say that this is a monstrously heavy tent. At 4 pounds, 11 ounces, there is one tent on our Guide to the Best Backpacking Tents that outweighs the Aurora 2. And among the Best Camping Tents , this would be the lightest by far.\n(Photo/Xiaoling Keller) It’s also fairly bulky for a backpacking tent, which many people mention in their reviews and which I experienced as well. It isn’t the slimmest backpacking tent out there. But again, the tradeoff is the level of comfort and room it offers inside.\nFor those who want something lighter, we love our NEMO OSMO Dagger 2 — but it comes at a much steeper price ($529).\nConclusion: Who Is It For? Tested across multiple seasons, the NEMO Aurora 2 has proven spacious, durable, and well-suited for regular camping trips; (photo/Xiaoling Keller) The NEMO Aurora 2 is an ideal tent for two people who love to camp often and want plenty of room for extra comfort. I’ve used other tents and I camp very frequently, and I’d highly recommend the NEMO Aurora 2 tent for its design and affordability. At $300, it would be the fourth cheapest option on both our guides to the Best Backpacking Tents and the Best Camping Tents .\nWhile I prefer the NEMO OSMO Dagger for backpacking, I find this tent perfect for car camping and as a backup for backpacking if needed. For people who want one tent that will work well for both, the Aurora 2 lands squarely in the crossover space.\nYou’ll be happy using it in either setting — especially if you have an extra person to split its weight and bulk with when you’re backpacking trail.\nThe NEMO Aurora 2 also comes with its own footprint. Tent footprints are usually sold separately, so that’s a nice extra touch that extends the life of the tent. For its price, this is a solid investment that doesn’t break the bank and will last for years.\nAn Ultralight Tent Without the Ultralight Tradeoffs: NEMO Hornet OSMO 3P Tent Review The semi-freestanding NEMO Hornet OSMO is very light, but it doesn’t sacrifice livability, storm protection, or the little details.
