  "text": "$2.7 million grant to help AAA Ambulance upgrade fleet\nFrom Forrest Health System\nPINE BELT, Miss. (WDAM) - A federal grant will help AAA Ambulance Service upgrade its fleet of vehicles as well as purchase more than two dozen, mechanical, chest-compression devices.\nAAA Chief Executive Officer Chuck Carter said a $2.7 million Community Project Funding/Congressional Directed Spending grant, was sponsored by United States Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.),\nThe CDS program allows members of Congress to request federal funds be set aside for specific projects in their states.\n“We appreciate Sen. Hyde-Smith’s commitment to the people of South Mississippi in helping provide funding for this new equipment through a CDS grant,” Carter said. “This will help ensure that the patients we serve throughout our coverage area are receiving the best possible care.”\nThe grant will fund 27 “Lucas” devices, mechanical chest compression devices, which will be spread across the ambulance service’s coverage area.\nThe grant also will allow the purchase of 11, new ambulances, each with a “Power-LOAD” stretcher system.\nSeven of the ambulances have arrived, and four more are in the final stages of completion at the vendor where lettering is being added and the Power-LOAD systems are being installed.\n“Paired with the new ambulances, the LUCAS device and Power-LOAD system will help improve operational efficiency and safety,” Carter said.\nThe Power-LOAD stretcher system removes the problem of paramedics and emergency medical technicians having to lift patients multiple times when they go on a call, Carter said.\n“The only lifting they will have to do is when they move the patient to or from the stretcher,” he said. “This protects both the patient and our personnel.”\nThe Lucas device is an automated, chest-compression system that is referred to as “your partner in life support,” Carter said.\nThe device, which is positioned both under and over a patient who is in cardiac arrest, performs chest compressions in place of an actual person, delivering guideline-consistent chest compressions to sudden cardiac arrest patients. The device can be used in the field, on the move and in the hospital.\nThe Lucas device is for use as a supplement to manual Cardiopulmonary resuscitation when effective manual CPR is not possible, like during transport, extended CPR, fatigue or when there is limited personnel.\nEvery online AAA Ambulance is equipped with the device.\nHyde-Smith said the AAA project is exactly what Congress had in mind when CDS was created.\n“My goal as a senator is to work to responsibly (and) use the federal appropriations process to help Mississippi communities and organizations access resources that will help them best serve their residents,” Hyde-Smith said. “The funding for these new ambulances and equipment reflect that process, which will mean better emergency care for people in Hattiesburg and the Pine Belt.”\nFounded in 1965, AAA Ambulance is Mississippi’s first and longest-standing emergency medical services provider. AAA was the first to be licensed, provide air response, train and test paramedics and to offer SMART 911.\nAAA Ambulance Service has a staff of more than 300 people and covers Forrest, Perry, Pearl River, Marion, Jefferson Davis, Walthall and Pike counties, as well Hattiesburg city limits encased in Lamar County.\nAAA’s communications center dispatches an average of 180 ground ambulance calls on a daily basis, as well as calls for three helicopters through Southeast Mississippi Air Ambulance District.\nWant more WDAM 7 news in your inbox?
