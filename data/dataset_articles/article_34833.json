  "text": "Sprouts Farmers Market’s first store in Wyoming is set to open Nov. 22 at 5214 Rue Terre in Cheyenne.\n“Access to fresh, healthy food is a vital component of any community’s quality of life, and I’m happy to welcome Sprouts to Cheyenne,” said Mayor Patrick Collins. “Sprouts adds another grocery option for our residents and will create around 100 jobs, further bolstering our local economy.”\nFrom Nov. 22-24, a variety of activities will celebrate the grand opening. A pop-up party out front will give guests the chance to sample seasonal produce from the tasting bar and participate in a guess-the-weight contest of an oversized piece of produce.\nThe first 100 shoppers Nov. 22-23 will receive a free reusable goodie bag filled with special products and samples. In addition, the first 400 guests Nov. 22 will receive a free long-stem rose courtesy of Falcon Farms Floral.\nInside the store, shoppers can taste new products while they shop from innovative brands at the Vendor Village. Giveaways and music will add to the festivities throughout the weekend.\n[ RELATED: Sprouts Expands Sustainability Partnership With IFCO ] In anticipation of the opening, shoppers will have the chance to win a $500 Sprouts gift card up until midnight Nov. 24 when they sign up through the Rue Terre store page on Sprouts’ website.\nIn addition, customers who text “CHEY” to 777-688 will receive 20 percent off their purchase over the grand opening weekend when they scan their app account barcode at checkout (up to two redemptions per Sprouts account per day). Shoppers can also view Sprouts’ weekly ad and save more than $100 with digital coupons every month via the app.\nSprouts Farmers Market is working with Wyoming farmers such as Gotham Green, Disanti Farms, Hazel Dell Mushrooms and Fagerberg Family Orchards. Through Sprouts’ Food Rescue program, the store will donate groceries that are no longer fit for sale but remain edible to Food Bank of the Rockies .",
