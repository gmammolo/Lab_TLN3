  "text": "KUALA TERENGGANU: The government’s concern for children with special needs, as translated by the Budget 2025 announcement on the construction of 11 Permata Centres, including in Terengganu, offers new hope to parents with autistic children. Parents seeking guidance and support to raise children with special needs are facing challenges in accessing specialised education centres, as the limited number of doctors and therapists in government hospitals makes it difficult to meet the demand for such services. Terengganu Autism Association chairman Engku Mohd Hairul Nizam Tuan Ahmad highlighted that because of this, autistic children are only able to receive therapy once a month when ideally, therapy sessions should be more frequent. “The therapists are not only for autistic children. They also need to train and treat other patients with Down Syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),” he said when contacted by Bernama. He added that currently, there are seven or eight therapists offering services at private premises in Terengganu, but not all parents can afford the hour-long sessions that cost between RM80 and RM150. Engku Mohd Hairul Nizam, whose son Luqmanul Hakim, 21, has mild autism, suggested that the new Permata Centres include a training module for parents so they could continue their children’s training and development at home. “I understand the challenges parents of autistic children face. Relying solely on therapists means these children miss out on training during holidays and weekends, yet they need consistent daily support.” Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, when tabling Budget 2025, announced the construction of 11 Permata Centres, including in Kelantan, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak, as part of the government’s commitment to ensure autistic children have access to quality education and support.
