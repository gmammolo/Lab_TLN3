  "text": "MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - November is epilepsy awareness month. Non-profit organization “Joey’s Song” will host a music festival from January 8-11 called “Freezing Man.” The goal is to help fight epilepsy with music. The event will take place at the Sylvee and Majestic Theatre. The World Health Organization says epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder worldwide, and it affects more people than multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and Parkinson’s disease combined. Mike Gomoll started the non-profit after losing his son, Joey, a week short of his fifth birthday from a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. Joey loved music, and while he couldn’t speak, he could sing and dance in his own way. “Music was his way of interacting with the world, so it made sense when we were looking for a medium to raise money, that we combined those two things as well,” Gomoll said. Since 2010, Joey’s Song has helped raise more than $1.3 million in the fight against epilepsy. What started as a one-day annual benefit concert has become a multi-day music festival starting January 2025. Gomoll says attendees can look forward to a mix of famous musicians performing songs and covers together, making for a unique musical experience. As a play on ‘Burning Man,’ the Freezing Man will feature music icons, Grammy winners, and Rock & Roll Hall of Famers. Some notable names include: Portugal The Man, KennyHoopla, and Silversun Pickups. All musicians volunteer their time and talent, and many have loved ones directly impacted by epilepsy. Concert proceeds are donated to epilepsy research and programs, such as Dr. Gemma L. Carvill’s Lab at Northwestern University. Dr. Carvill uses gene discovery and molecular biology to identify new epilepsy treatments. The goal is to determine the underlying causes of epilepsy in order to develop a personalized approach to care and treatment. Beyond raising research dollars, Joey’s Song hopes the event will help raise awareness and comradery among the community. “We’ll have several thousand people come through these venues that week,” said Gomoll. “Besides hearing great music, they’ll learn what epilepsy is, what’s being done, and kind of all those big awareness things.” Music festival tickets are on sale at JoeysSong.org Click here to download the WMTV15 News app or our WMTV15 First Alert weather app. Copyright 2024 WMTV.
