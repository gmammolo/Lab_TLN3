  "text": "[Health & Fitness](/illinois/chicagoheights/lifestyle) Free Men’s Health Community Seminar at Franciscan Health Olympia Fields hospital to host free seminar discussing a minimally invasive solution for men's urinary issues on Tuesday, November 19 Men struggling with urinary issues due to an enlarged prostate are invited to learn about an innovative, minimally invasive treatment option at a free Franciscan Health Olympia Fields community seminar. The seminar, entitled “PAE: A Minimally Invasive Solution for Men’s Urinary Issues,” will take place Tuesday, November 19, at 6:00 p.m., at the Franciscan Health Olympia Fields Auditorium located at 20201 S. Crawford Ave. Led by interventional radiologist Saud Ahmed, MD, this informative session will provide insights into Prostatic Artery Embolization (PAE) — a procedure designed to alleviate urinary symptoms by reducing the size of an enlarged prostate. Unlike traditional surgery, PAE is a less invasive option where an interventional radiologist restricts blood flow to the prostate, leading to significant symptom relief with a safer approach. This event not only offers a chance to explore a potential solution but also includes free refreshments and giveaways for attendees. Space is limited, so early reservations are encouraged.
