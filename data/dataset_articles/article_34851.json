  "text": "Alkermes’ presentations feature research on its investigational treatment ALKS 2680 for narcolepsy and insights on the burden of living with the condition. Summary: Alkermes presented new research on its investigational narcolepsy treatment, ALKS 2680, as well as findings on the patient experience of narcolepsy at two scientific conferences: the 37th Annual Psych Congress and the 2024 Neuroscience Education Institute Congress. The data includes safety and efficacy results from a phase 1b study of ALKS 2680, a selective orexin 2 receptor agonist for narcolepsy types 1 and 2, alongside qualitative insights into the clinical and humanistic burden of living with narcolepsy.\nKey Takeaways:\nInvestigational Narcolepsy Treatment : Alkermes shared safety and efficacy data on ALKS 2680, a selective orexin 2 receptor agonist, for treating narcolepsy types 1 and 2. Patient-Centered Research : Qualitative interviews and literature reviews revealed insights into the clinical, economic, and personal burdens associated with narcolepsy. Cross-Disorder Focus : Alkermes’ research presentations at major conferences also included data on treatments and patient experiences for schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Alkermes plc announced the presentation of research related to its research in narcolepsy, as well as schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder, at two scientific conferences this fall.\nThe two meetings are the 37th Annual Psych Congress (Psych Congress), which took place Oct 29 to Nov 2 in Boston, and the 2024 Neuroscience Education Institute Congress, taking place Nov 7-10 in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n“The wealth of data being presented at these important medical gatherings underscores the substantive research being conducted at Alkermes to understand the experiences of people taking our commercial and investigational medicines, as well as advance knowledge about the complex disease states in which we work,” says Craig Hopkinson, MD, chief medical officer and executive vice president of research and development at Alkermes, in a release. “We are excited to share our insights with stakeholders from across the psychiatric and neuroscience communities and engage in valuable scientific exchange to help advance care for patients living with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and narcolepsy.”\nAlkermes is developing ALKS 2680, an investigational medicine in development as a once-daily treatment for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.\nAklermes presented multiple posters related to the company’s work in narcolepsy, including:\nSafety and efficacy data from the proof-of-concept phase 1b study of ALKS 2680, the company’s novel, investigational, oral, selective orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) agonist, in patients with narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2 ; and Research from in-depth, qualitative interviews and systematic literature reviews designed to better understand the clinical, economic, and humanistic burden associated with narcolepsy. The list of Alkermes’ presentations in narcolepsy by meeting is as follows:\nPsych Congress\nPoster #23: Safety and Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Orexin 2 Receptor Agonist ALKS 2680 in Patients With Narcolepsy Type 1: A First-in-Human Phase 1 Study Poster #125: The Burden of Living With Narcolepsy: Patient Perspectives From In-Depth Qualitative Interviews Poster #126: Clinical, Economic, and Humanistic Burden Associated With Narcolepsy: Results From a Systematic Literature Review Poster #170: The Orexin 2 Receptor Agonist ALKS 2680 in Patients With Narcolepsy Type 2: An Initial Proof of Concept Phase 1b Study 2024 Neuroscience Education Institute Congress\nPoster 73: The Burden of Living With Narcolepsy: Patient Perspectives from In-Depth Qualitative Interviews Poster 74: Clinical, Economic, and Humanistic Burden Associated With Narcolepsy: Results From a Systematic Literature Review ID 68691723 © Kiosea39 | Dreamstime.com\nFurther Reading for You: How to Select the Most Suitable Pharmacotherapy for Type 1 Narcolepsy Patients Once-Nightly Lumryz Attracts Over 1,200 Narcolepsy Patients Since June Launch Health Canada Approves Wakix for Pediatric Narcolepsy Patients Orexin-2 Receptor Agonist E2086 to Be Tested in Narcolepsy Patients Narcolepsy Patients Prefer Once-Nightly Lumryz Over Twice-Nightly Oxybate",
