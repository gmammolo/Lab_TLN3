  "text": "From livening up a salad to increasing digestive power, a splash of vinegar has many healing effects.\nA splash of vinegar in your cooking enhances flavor and provides a range of health benefits.\nHealth Benefits of Vinegar Vinegar was used by the Babylonians for cooking, as a preservative, and as a medicine. Today, it is still valued for health and healing.\n1. Relieves Fatigue Vinegar can help break down lactic acid buildup in the body, effectively relieving fatigue, restoring energy, and alleviating shoulder and lower back pain.\nA randomized clinical trial found that apple cider vinegar functions similarly to sports drinks by reducing lactic acid buildup after endurance exercise, thereby delaying muscle fatigue. 2. Promotes Glucose Metabolism Vinegar can promote calorie burning and boost metabolic rate.\nA clinical study published in Nature found that adding a bit of vinegar to foods with a high glycemic index, such as mashed potatoes, can help lower post-meal blood sugar levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 3. Reduces Risk of Kidney Stones Regular vinegar consumption can increase the alkalinity of urine, lowering the risk of uric acid stones.\nA study published in eBioMedicine indicated that people taking 15 ml of vinegar daily had a lower risk of developing kidney stones. Urine samples showed higher pH levels, lower uric acid and calcium concentrations, and elevated citrate levels—known to suppress kidney stone formation. 4. Supports Digestive Health Vinegar can stimulate gastric acid secretion, thereby boosting appetite and enhancing digestion.\n5. Regulates Blood Pressure Apple cider vinegar can promote sodium excretion and improve abnormal sodium metabolism, reducing the risk of hypertension caused by excess salt in the body. Other types of fermented vinegar also have blood pressure-lowering effects.\nA 2022 review showed that each 30 ml increase in daily vinegar consumption reduced systolic blood pressure by 3.25 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.33 mmHg. 6. Lowers cholesterol levels Vinegar can reduce serum cholesterol levels, effectively lowering the risk of arteriosclerosis and heart disease.\nA meta-analysis indicated that consuming apple cider vinegar can reduce total serum cholesterol by 6.06 mg/dL. 7. Improves Skin Health Increased levels of lipid peroxides can cause dark spots on the skin, reduce skin elasticity, and lead to wrinkles and sagging. Vinegar can inhibit the production of lipid peroxides, offering beauty and skincare benefits .\n8. Eases Hangover Symptoms Vinegar can enhance liver function and help reduce the effects of alcohol.\nRelated Stories\nA 2021 study on mice found that vinegar is rich in polyphenols, which can protect against ethanol-induced liver damage, modulate gut microbiota, and reduce intestinal inflammation. 9. Treats Nail Fungus Vinegar is an excellent antimicrobial agent that can inhibit the growth and reproduction of microorganisms by disrupting their living conditions. For example, soaking hands or feet in a solution of about four fluid ounces of quality vinegar mixed with one liter of water for 20 minutes may help treat fungal nail infections.\n10. Stops Hiccups When hiccups become severe, sipping vinegar may help relieve diaphragm spasms that trigger them.\n11. Relieves Motion Sickness People with gastrointestinal issues or indigestion are prone to motion sickness and nausea. Drinking a small cup of diluted vinegar water before traveling may help alleviate symptoms of motion sickness.\n12. Alleviates Cold Symptoms At the onset of a cold, gargling with a solution of 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and ½ teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water may help relieve symptoms and speed up recovery.\nPrecautions for Taking Vinegar Avoid excessive intake: Vinegar is highly acidic, and overconsumption may weaken tendons and soften teeth, according to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). People with dampness in the spleen and stomach and with muscle weakness should avoid taking vinegar: In TCM, the spleen and stomach are viewed as a system that regulates digestion and metabolism. Symptoms of dampness in this system include bloating after drinking water and sticky stools. People with muscle fatigue, joint stiffness, or early cold symptoms should also avoid taking vinegar. People with stomach ulcers or excessive stomach acid: Those with gastric or duodenal ulcers or those prone to acid reflux are advised to avoid vinegar. Do not use copper cookware for preparation: Vinegar can dissolve copper, potentially leading to copper toxicity if used during cooking.
