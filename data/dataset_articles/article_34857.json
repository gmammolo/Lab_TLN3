  "text": "TAMAQUA, Pa. — The Tamaqua Area School District has welcomed a new four-legged friend who does more than comfort students and faculty.\nJessica Paisley is a special education teacher at Tamaqua Area High School. When she adopted Breaker two years ago, she knew his rigorous training would make him a cherished member of her community. Tamaqua Area High School welcomed him with open arms.\n\"The primary goal is really to improve school culture and climate, and so for Breaker, just having him here completely changes the dynamic of some of our student's day,\" said Jessica Paisley, Breaker's Handler.\n\"It's fantastic. I look forward to finding Breaker every day. When I see him in the hallway, it's always a happy surprise. It's very different from last year, not having Breaker and this year having Breaker. It's completely different,\" said Julie Oaks, a sophomore at Tamaqua Area High School.\nWhile Breaker provides comfort and support to students and faculty, that's not all he can do.\n\"We're easily able to incorporate him into our curriculum as well,\" said Paisley.\nBreaker was involved in this follow-up lesson during a psychology class on what motivates people to do difficult things. Paisley showed the students what motivates Breaker to complete different tasks, how they can relate it to the lesson, and their own motivations.\nStudents volunteered to give Breaker treats after he followed different commands, like talking using a button. In addition to talking, Paisley says Breaker has also learned how to read. She can give him a set of commands written on paper, and Breaker completes them.\nPaisley says the school district received some grant money to expand breaker's training to help even more students.\n\"I think that because he's so versatile, he's able to just connect with the students on a different level than the rest of us here, and it gives them somebody to look forward to seeing every day,\" explained Paisley.\nClose Ad",
