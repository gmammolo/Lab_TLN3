  "text": "Across the world, [one in five](https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2024-global-cancer-burden-growing--amidst-mounting-need-for-services) people are diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. By age 85, almost [one in two](https://www.cancer.org.au/cancer-information/what-is-cancer/facts-and-figures) Australians will be diagnosed with cancer. When it happens to someone you care about, it can be hard to know what to say or how to help them. But providing the right support to a friend can make all the difference as they face the emotional and physical challenges of a new diagnosis and treatment. Here are six ways to offer meaningful support to a friend who has been diagnosed with cancer. 1. Recognise and respond to emotions When facing a cancer diagnosis and treatment, it's normal to experience a range of [emotions](https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/impacted-by-cancer/emotions#:%7E:text=It's%20likely%20that%20feelings%20will,these%20feelings%20ease%20with%20time) including fear, anger, grief and sadness. Your friend's moods may fluctuate. It is also common for feelings to [change over time](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00520-014-2492-9) , for example your friend's anxiety may decrease, but they may feel more depressed. Some friends may want to share details while others will prefer privacy. Always ask permission to raise sensitive topics (such as changes in physical appearance or their thoughts regarding fears and anxiety) and don't make assumptions. It's OK to tell them you feel awkward, as this acknowledges the challenging situation they are facing. When they feel comfortable to talk, follow their lead. Your support and willingness [to listen without judgement](https://www.cancervic.org.au/get-support/stories/what-to-say-and-not-say.html) can provide great comfort. You don't have to have the answers. Simply acknowledging what has been said, providing your full attention and being present for them will be a great help. 2. Understand their diagnosis and treatment [Understanding](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pon.4722) your friend's diagnosis and what they'll go through when being [treated](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/caregivers/what-a-caregiver-does/treatment-timeline.html) may be helpful. Being informed can reduce your own worry. It may also help you to listen better and reduce the amount of explaining your friend has to do, especially when they're tired or overwhelmed. Explore reputable sources such as the [Cancer Council website](https://www.cancer.org.au/) for accurate information, so you can have meaningful conversations. But keep in mind your friend has a trusted medical team to offer personalised and accurate advice. 3. Check in regularly Cancer treatment can be isolating, so regular check-ins, texts, calls or visits can help your friend feel less alone. Having a normal conversation and sharing a joke can be very welcome. But everyone copes with cancer differently. Be patient and flexible in your support - some days will be harder for them than others. Remembering key dates - such as the next round of chemotherapy - can help your friend feel supported. Celebrating milestones, including the end of treatment or anniversary dates, may boost morale and remind your friend of positive moments in their cancer journey. Always ask if it's a good time to visit, as your friend's immune system [may be compromised](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/what-is-cancer/body-systems-and-cancer/the-immune-system-and-cancer#:%7E:text=to%20fight%20cancer-,Cancer%20and%20treatments%20may%20weaken%20immunity,high%20dose%20of%20steroids) by their cancer or treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. If you're feeling unwell, it's best to postpone visits - but they may still appreciate a call or text. 4. Offer practical support Sometimes the best way to show your care is through practical support. There may be different ways to offer help, and what your friend needs might change at the beginning, during and after treatment. For example, you could offer to pick up prescriptions, drive them to appointments so they have transport and company to debrief, or wait with them at appointments. Meals will always be welcome. However it's important to remember cancer and its treatments may [affect](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition#effects-of-cancer-treatment-on-nutrition) taste, smell and appetite, as well as your friend's ability to eat enough or absorb nutrients. You may want to check first if there are particular foods they like. [Good nutrition](https://www.cancervic.org.au/downloads/resources/booklets/nutrition-cancer.pdf) can help boost their strength while dealing with the side effects of treatment. There may also be family responsibilities you can help with, for example, babysitting kids, grocery shopping or taking care of pets. 5. Explore supports together Studies [have shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35834503/) mindfulness practices can be an effective way for people to manage anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis and its treatment. If this is something your friend is interested in, it may be enjoyable to explore classes (either online or in-person) together. You may also be able to help your friend connect with organisations that provide emotional and practical help, such as the Cancer Council's [support line](https://www.cancer.org.au/support-and-services/cancer-council-13-11-20) , which offers free, confidential information and support for anyone affected by cancer, including family, friends and carers. [Peer support groups](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5659099_Systematic_review_of_peer-support_programs_for_people_with_cancer) can also reduce your friend's feelings of isolation and foster shared understanding and empathy with people who've gone through a similar experience. GPs [can help](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34333571/) with referrals to support programs. 6. Stick with them Be committed. Many people feel [isolated](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11120751/) after their treatment. This may be because regular appointments have reduced or stopped - which can feel like losing a safety net - or because their relationships with others have changed. Your friend may also experience emotions such as worry, lack of confidence and uncertainty as they adjust to a [new way of living](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/coping/survivorship/new-normal) after their treatment has ended. This will be an important time to support your friend. But don't forget: looking after [yourself](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/caring-for-someone-with-cancer) is important too. Making sure you eat well, sleep, exercise and have emotional support will help steady you through what may be a challenging time for you, as well as the friend you love. [Our research](https://www.deakin.edu.au/faculty-of-health/research/cancer-carer-hub) team is developing new programs and resources to support carers of people who live with cancer. While it can be a challenging experience, it can also be immensely rewarding, and your small acts of kindness can make a big difference.",
