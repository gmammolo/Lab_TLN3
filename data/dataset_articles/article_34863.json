  "text": "Children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) display specific behaviors and parents can help prevent the symptoms from developing further by being mindful of their parenting.\nAn estimated 7 million children in the U.S. aged between three and 17 years have been diagnosed with ADHD. As people with said condition [struggle with several daily tasks](https://www.thefocus.news/lifestyle/doctor-with-adhd-swears-4-hacks-can-make-a-huge-difference/) that are easy for an average human to do, early intervention can be life-changing.\nADHD symptoms in children\nChildren with ADHD tend to be highly excited, and more curious compared to an average child. They also show positive responses to unfamiliar situations or people.\nAs the study by the University of Waterloo points out, exuberance in pre-schoolers is perceived as a “positive” trait, the children may find it difficult to regulate their emotions and could struggle with executive functions such as working memory and flexible thinking.\nUpon following 291 children from just four months to 15 years of age, the researchers found that symptoms of ADHD in children increase throughout childhood.\n“Symptoms of ADHD typically stabilize from ages five to nine and decrease from ages nine to 15. But for predictable cases of very young children with exuberant temperament and less directive parenting, that stabilization may not occur,” said Dr. Heather Henderson, the co-author of the study.\nDirective parenting can ‘prevent’ the symptoms\nWhile conventional parenting that involves more control over the child’s behavior may not work on children with ADHD, more directive parenting “can prevent the symptoms”, according to the study.\nThis means, that approaching children’s temperament by guiding them with verbal and physical cues is important.\nResearchers say parents can “break down the pathways” that lead to ADHD with engaged parenting behavior. [NHS UK](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/symptoms/) notes that symptoms of ADHD are noticeable before the age of 6, either at home or at school.\nChildren with the condition tend to be inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive. Some of the more common symptoms include the inability to remember things or losing personal belongings, difficulty sticking to tasks or organizing them.",
