  "text": "HATCo to purchase Summa Health, subject to regulatory review and approval AKRON, Ohio (WOIO) - Summa Health and General Catalyst’s Health Assurance Transformation LLC announced today that the two organizations have signed a Definitive Agreement outlining the proposed sale of Summa Health to HATCo for $485 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval. “As part of HATCo, Summa Health will be better positioned to build upon our existing strengths and capabilities while also benefiting from new opportunities and technology. Our goals are to expand access to care and improve the experience for our patients, providers, and staff,” said Cliff Deveny, M.D., Summa Health President and CEO. “This is only the beginning of our long-term journey together.” The Definitive Agreement outlines the proposed terms and conditions of HATCo’s acquisition of Summa Health and reflects a significant investment in the health system. The purchase price of $485 million, when added to Summa Health’s current cash, will enable the health system to eliminate $850 million in existing debt. The remaining cash, after closing adjustments, will fund a new, separately governed community foundation that will support focused investment to benefit community health in the Greater Akron region. HATCo has also committed to $350 million in capital funding within the first five years to ensure necessary resources are available for routine purposes, and investment in technologies that support growth. Summa Health will maintain its charity care policy, community benefits, and essential services it currently offers while focusing on sustainable growth and enhanced access to care for people across the region. Summa Health’s staff is at the forefront of all discussions relevant to the transaction. Copyright 2024 WOIO. All rights reserved.",
