  "text": "Kristin D. Alden is a skilled litigator and fierce advocate dedicated to protecting employees’ rights in the workplace. Kristin and her firm have fought tirelessly to enforce the laws prohibiting harassment and discrimination, to protect brave employees who speak up against wrongdoing, and to compel employers to accommodate employees’ medical needs and pay them the wages they earn.\nKristin manages the firm’s practice while also representing its clients from virtually every workplace – the federal government, local government, corporations, and non-profits. Kristin has counseled and represented thousands of employees in claims against their current and former employers in court and before federal and local agencies charged with protecting civil rights in the workplace, including the D.C. Office of Human Rights, D.C. Office of Employee Appeals, D.C. Office of Administrative Hearings, Foreign Service Grievance Board, the Congressional Office of Compliance, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), the U.S. Department of Labor and local agencies in Virginia, DC and Maryland.\nKristin received her J.D. in 1992 from the Washington College of Law of the American University and her B.A. from the Johns Hopkins University. Kristin has been admitted to practice law in Virginia since 1992, followed by her admissions to the Bars of Maryland and the District of Columbia.",
