  "text": "Free Narcan vending machines coming to Mobile County The Mobile County Health Department is partnering with LTS Health to open 5 kiosks that will dispense Narcan and condoms for free to the community. MOBILE, Ala. ([WALA](https://www.fox10tv.com/)) - Narcan vending machines are now in Mobile County, ready to save lives. The Mobile County Health Department is partnering with LTS Health to open 5 kiosks that will dispense Narcan and condoms for free to the community. MCHD says starting this week, 5 vending machines are being placed across the county. The machines dispense Narcan nasal spray that will help reverse opioid overdoses, but if someone does need Narcan, health experts say they will still need medical attention. You’ll need to call 911, too. One machine is already up and running at Vista Medical, an addiction treatment clinic on Springhill Avenue. “It’s 24-hour access and you don’t have to tell anyone that you’re coming up here to get it. I really feel like everyone needs Narcan in your car-- you just never know what you’re going to see,” said Kelly Hammack, Therapist at Vista Medical. “The good thing about this is- you don’t have to be a patient in treatment. This is available to everyone in the community-- anyone that has been touched by the addiction can come and get the Narcan,” added Alisa Johnston, Nurse Practitioner at Vista Medical. The service is completely free. All you have to do is enter a phone number and some basic information before that machine dispenses what you need. Vista Medical says each person can receive up to two packages of Narcan and two packs of condoms per month. “I’m hoping that if people need it, they know we are a treatment center and they can just come in the door,” said Johnston. Another machine is ready inside B-Bob’s Bar in Downtown Mobile. In fact, owner Jerry Ehlen says it’s the first bar in the state to have a Narcan vending machine. “They wanted to put one here as a central location to Downtown Mobile. You never know what someone could have ingested either before they got here or wherever they are- sometimes people pre-party,” said Ehlen. So far, folks in the community are receptive to the idea. Many people say the free resources will help people that otherwise couldn’t get access to life-saving measures. “That’s another reason why a lot of people don’t seek help is because of the cost,” said one local. “It gives me a sense of peace because I know that historically, there hasn’t been much-- or many resources in our area for addicts even though it doesn’t affect everyone.” The fifth machine will be located in Citronelle and that location will be announced later on. And FOX10 News can’t stress it enough. MCHD Dr. Kevin Michaels says if a kit is used, 911 should be call immediately because overdoses require more than one dose to reverse the effects of the substance.
