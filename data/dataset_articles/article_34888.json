Seniors wanting to cast a line in Washington are in luck; licenses are significantly discounted for people over the age of 70. Washington offers several license options, according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The Annual Freshwater License is the most useful here in the Columbia Basin, where the nearest salt water is more than 100 miles away. This license covers all inland waters, including the Columbia River and its tributaries. For folks who can get to the west side easily, the Annual Saltwater License is for anglers who love the challenge of coastal and Puget Sound fishing, according to the WSFW. This includes fishing in marine areas and for salmon and steelhead in saltwater. For those who like to spend their time at the beach, the Shellfish/Seaweed license covers clams, mussels, oysters, and seaweed collection. And then there's an Annual Combination License, which covers all three. This is where the savings come in, according to the WDFW. For most Washington residents, the Annual Freshwater License is $29.50 per year. For seniors 70 and up, it's only $7.50. The other licenses are similarly affordable for seniors. The Annual Saltwater License is $8.05 for seniors compared to $30.05 for everyone else, and the Combination License is only $19.05 for seniors versus the standard adult fee of $55.35. Acquiring a senior license is easy. They're available online at fishhunt.dfw.wa.gov, by phone at 360-902-2464 or at any business that sells licenses. Ordering online or by phone can mean a delay of up to 10 days, the WDFW wrote, but they'll email a temporary license to use until the regular one arrives. The WDFW offers some tips for seniors to get the most out of their fishing trip: —Explore new waters: Use the money saved on your license to visit different fishing spots across the state. Washington boasts over 7,000 lakes and 70,000 miles of rivers and streams, offering endless exploration opportunities. —Invest in quality gear: Put the savings towards that high-end rod or reel you've always wanted. Many tackle shops offer senior discounts, so be sure to ask. —Attend fishing clinics: WDFW regularly hosts fishing clinics, some specifically designed for seniors. These events can help you brush up on skills or learn new techniques. —Consider guided trips: With the money saved on licenses, treat yourself to a guided fishing trip. Many guides offer senior discounts and can provide access to prime fishing spots you might not discover on your own. —Fish during off-peak times: As a senior, you likely have more flexible schedules. Take advantage of this by fishing during weekdays or off-seasons when the waters are less crowded. More information can be found at wdfw.wa.gov. ___ (c)2024 the Columbia Basin Herald, Wash.
