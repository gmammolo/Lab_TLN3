  "text": "With the holidays approaching, the Greater Boston Food Bank on Thursday hosted the 19th annual Chain of Giving event to help community members in need and highlight the issue of food insecurity. “What today does is remind people that hunger is a real issue — and not just at Thanksgiving, but 365 days a year,” said The Greater Boston Food Bank President and CEO Catherine D’Amato. The event at the Greater Boston Food Bank warehouse brought together elected officials, service providers, food distributors and volunteers. Participants formed a human chain to pass 1,200 turkeys that will be donated to families. Altogether, the food bank expects to distribute 46,000 turkeys and other food items to pantries throughout the holidays. The food bank’s latest research estimates that about [ 1.9 million adults in Massachusetts are food insecure](https://www.gbfb.org/news/press-releases/nearly-2-million-adults-massachusetts-food-insecure-including-45-adults-four-counties-according-greater-boston-food-banks-fourth-annual-statewide-study/), an increase from last year’s survey. The food bank says said high housing costs and other expenses have forced more people to sacrifice meals. To help serve those in need, the organization on Thursday cut the ribbon on a new 38-foot refrigerator unit with capacity for up to 400 pallets. “I’ve been here for all 19 [Chain of Giving events] and I continue to feel hopeful we have the next generation of leaders,” D’Amato said. “Little, small, big — it doesn’t matter what is given in the dollar amount, or time. It’s the effort.”",
