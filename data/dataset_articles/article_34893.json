With the right presents, though, you can extend that magic well past December.\nThoughtful gifting is “nicer” than an expensive present.\nFrom experiences that provide lifelong memories to charitable donations that uplift and empower others, these carefully curated gift ideas will cultivate a sense of joy that spreads far beyond your own four walls.\nHit subscribe Whether it’s a streaming service, curated kit or delivery box, a subscription is the gift that keeps on giving.\nEase your loved one’s mental load with a meal or snack-box delivery, encourage them to make time for their hobbies with a craft or gardening kit, treat their ears to a music or audiobook subscription or spoil them with a monthly wine or beer membership.\nAs well as offering ongoing enjoyment, subscription services also provide a deeper sense of personalisation — something we can all appreciate.\nAdventure awaits Surprise your loved one with an experiential gift this Christmas and not only will you help keep their home clutter-free, you’ll help create cherished memories, too.\nFrom hot-air balloon rides, horse-riding expeditions and wilderness escapes to concerts, fine dining and spa visits, there are plenty of experiences to choose from.\nAdvertisement It doesn’t need to be extravagant to make an impact, either. Keep it simple with a cooking class, paint and sip or movie night — anything that encourages them to break from routine and soak up the happy vibes.\nThe magic of giving\nA charitable gift is priceless. Credit: iStock\nNothing encapsulates the spirit of Christmas more than giving to those in need. As well as bringing joy to your own life, and your recipient’s, you’re also giving the gift of a better future.\nThis year, the Petstock Foundation is making it easier than ever to do your part for people and pets in need with The Christmas Project .\n“We know Christmas can be a difficult time for the most vulnerable people in our community, with many people experiencing even more financial strain, loneliness and increased anxiety during this time,” says Petstock Foundation head Jessica Curtis.\n“At the Petstock Foundation, we understand the magic that pets and animals can bring to our lives, and our aim is to strengthen the rewarding bond between pets and people.”\nTo give the gift of a better future this Christmas, you can purchase a Petstock Foundation Christmas gift or Petstock Foundation product either in store or online until December 31.\n“One hundred per cent of the proceeds from The Christmas Project will be donated to eight organisations nationwide,” Curtis explains. These charities include Guide Dogs Australia and Assistance Dogs Australia, as well as Lucy’s Project in NSW.\n“Donations will enable charities to provide the gifts of sight, confidence, independence and empowerment for people who need them most,” Curtis adds. “Big or small, every gift is a chance to make a difference.”\nJewellery is forever Want to make a lasting impression? Explore the world of permanent jewellery. Unlike a diamond necklace or watch that’s only worn on special occasions, permanent jewellery is meant for everyday wear. Welded together while you’re wearing it, permanent jewellery (which often comes in the form of a simple chained bracelet, anklet or necklace) is the ultimate symbol of connection.\nIf your recipient prefers their jewellery with a clasp, opt for personalised pieces such as astrological pendants, birthstone jewels or timeless initials to keep it meaningful.\nThe gift of wellness Help your pal or partner nail their fitness goals with a gym membership or kick-start their journey with a one-month pass to a Pilates or yoga studio.\nIf they’re already locked in, get them excited to work out with some new accessories. Think weights and resistance bands, boxing gear, yoga blocks or a foam roller. Nothing says you care like investing in their health.\nThanks for the memories Collate your favourite moments into a photobook for your parents, siblings, friends or partner. A physical book will allow them to revisit your special memories time and time again, while a digital album will leave room for the highlights still to come.\nAs we navigate the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, let’s remember that the most enduring gifts aren’t always wrapped in paper. These gifts, whether grand or small, offer a lasting legacy of joy, connection and wellness that will continue to enrich lives long after the holiday season has passed.\nTo give the gift of a better future and purchase a Petstock Foundation gift or to learn more about The Christmas Project, click here .",
