  "text": "Across the world, one in five people are diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. By age 85, almost one in two Australians will be diagnosed with cancer.\nWhen it happens to someone you care about, it can be hard to know what to say or how to help them. But providing the right support to a friend can make all the difference as they face the emotional and physical challenges of a new diagnosis and treatment.\nHere are six ways to offer meaningful support to a friend who has been diagnosed with cancer.\n1. Recognise and respond to emotions When facing a cancer diagnosis and treatment, it’s normal to experience a range of emotions including fear, anger, grief and sadness. Your friend’s moods may fluctuate. It is also common for feelings to change over time , for example your friend’s anxiety may decrease, but they may feel more depressed.\nSpending time together can mean a lot to someone who is feeling isolated during cancer treatment. Chokniti-Studio/Shutterstock Some friends may want to share details while others will prefer privacy. Always ask permission to raise sensitive topics (such as changes in physical appearance or their thoughts regarding fears and anxiety) and don’t make assumptions. It’s OK to tell them you feel awkward, as this acknowledges the challenging situation they are facing.\nWhen they feel comfortable to talk, follow their lead. Your support and willingness to listen without judgement can provide great comfort. You don’t have to have the answers. Simply acknowledging what has been said, providing your full attention and being present for them will be a great help.\n2. Understand their diagnosis and treatment Understanding your friend’s diagnosis and what they’ll go through when being treated may be helpful.\nBeing informed can reduce your own worry. It may also help you to listen better and reduce the amount of explaining your friend has to do, especially when they’re tired or overwhelmed.\nExplore reputable sources such as the Cancer Council website for accurate information, so you can have meaningful conversations. But keep in mind your friend has a trusted medical team to offer personalised and accurate advice.\n3. Check in regularly Cancer treatment can be isolating, so regular check-ins, texts, calls or visits can help your friend feel less alone.\nHaving a normal conversation and sharing a joke can be very welcome. But everyone copes with cancer differently. Be patient and flexible in your support – some days will be harder for them than others.\nRemembering key dates – such as the next round of chemotherapy – can help your friend feel supported. Celebrating milestones, including the end of treatment or anniversary dates, may boost morale and remind your friend of positive moments in their cancer journey.\nAlways ask if it’s a good time to visit, as your friend’s immune system may be compromised by their cancer or treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. If you’re feeling unwell, it’s best to postpone visits – but they may still appreciate a call or text.\n4. Offer practical support Sometimes the best way to show your care is through practical support. There may be different ways to offer help, and what your friend needs might change at the beginning, during and after treatment.\nFor example, you could offer to pick up prescriptions, drive them to appointments so they have transport and company to debrief, or wait with them at appointments.\nMeals will always be welcome. However it’s important to remember cancer and its treatments may affect taste, smell and appetite, as well as your friend’s ability to eat enough or absorb nutrients. You may want to check first if there are particular foods they like. Good nutrition can help boost their strength while dealing with the side effects of treatment.\nThere may also be family responsibilities you can help with, for example, babysitting kids, grocery shopping or taking care of pets.\nThere may be practical ways you can help, such as dropping off meals. David Trinks/Unsplash 5. Explore supports together Studies have shown mindfulness practices can be an effective way for people to manage anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis and its treatment.\nIf this is something your friend is interested in, it may be enjoyable to explore classes (either online or in-person) together.\nYou may also be able to help your friend connect with organisations that provide emotional and practical help, such as the Cancer Council’s support line , which offers free, confidential information and support for anyone affected by cancer, including family, friends and carers.\nPeer support groups can also reduce your friend’s feelings of isolation and foster shared understanding and empathy with people who’ve gone through a similar experience. GPs can help with referrals to support programs.\n6. Stick with them Be committed. Many people feel isolated after their treatment. This may be because regular appointments have reduced or stopped – which can feel like losing a safety net – or because their relationships with others have changed.\nYour friend may also experience emotions such as worry, lack of confidence and uncertainty as they adjust to a new way of living after their treatment has ended. This will be an important time to support your friend.\nBut don’t forget: looking after yourself is important too. Making sure you eat well, sleep, exercise and have emotional support will help steady you through what may be a challenging time for you, as well as the friend you love.\nOur research team is developing new programs and resources to support carers of people who live with cancer. While it can be a challenging experience, it can also be immensely rewarding, and your small acts of kindness can make a big difference.\nDr Stephanie Cowdery is the appointed Research Fellow (Cancer Care Centre) for The Cancer Carer Hub funded by the Victorian Department of Health.\nAnna Ugalde receives funding from national competitive funding bodies including Victorian Cancer Agency, MRFF, NHMRC and Department of Health and Aged Care.\nTrish Livingston receives funding from competitive external granting bodies, including NHMRC, MRFF and Cancer Australia. The Cancer Carer Hub is funded by the Victorian Department of Health.\nVictoria White receives funding from national competitive external granting organisations including MRFF and NHMRC, Victorian Department of Health, Breast Cancer Network Australia and Cancer Council Victoria.\nSource: theconversation.com Read Entire Article Source\nTo remove this article - Removal Request\nHomepage International Your friend has been diagnosed with cancer.
