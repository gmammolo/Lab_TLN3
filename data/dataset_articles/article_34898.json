  "text": "The Turn Center boosts staffing to serve more patients in Amarillo AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - More children in our area now have the opportunity to receive speech therapy through the Turn Center after an increase in staffing. According to the Turn Center, they’ve hired more speech pathologists to increase the amount of families they serve. This has almost eliminated their waitlist for the first time in years. “What can we do to support this family? What do they need to help better their lives,” said Stephanie Wright, outpatient therapy director, Turn Center. “And once we can kind of start digging into that and the parents start taking our recommendations, their lives are forever changed. That kiddo can now meet those milestones.” The Turn Center serves children from infants to 21 years of age with a range of abilities in order to support developmental skills. “In self-play and parallel talk, we‘re talking about what the kid is doing using the language they don’t physically have at that moment, and we‘re modeling for that when the time comes. They know in their tool box what they can use while they’re playing,” said Madasyn Epp, speech language pathologist, Turn Center. The Turn Center also offers occupational and physical therapy, which allows all three disciplines to work with one another to benefit patients. “We have a lot of resources. We have this pool, we have the apartment. We have a sensory room, we have the big gym and a small gym. We have lots of different areas that can work and incorporate daily life activities or just extra support for our kids that need it,” said Epp. If you have any concerns regarding your child’s development, talk to your pediatrician for guidance.
