She has dedicated her research to finding treatments for binge eating and bulimia syndromes. Her passion is evident through her involvement in [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.fsu.edu/) Professor Lisa Eckel’s neuroscience lab, where she examines how semaglutide (Ozempic) affects binge eating.\nGuard is also an Ignite Fellow with Teach for America and helps elementary and middle school students with math and reading. She focuses on targeting weaknesses and boosting students’ confidence, finding satisfaction in their academic growth and excitement for learning.\nGuard hopes her research and dedication to education will inspire other undergraduates to start their own research. Her goal is to provide academic resources for underprivileged students and ensure they have access to educational opportunities in the future.\nWhat made FSU stand out to you when you were applying to colleges?\nI chose to attend FSU because of its undergraduate [neuroscience program](https://neuro.fsu.edu/#:~:text=The%20FSU%20Program%20in%20Neuroscience,a%20wide%20range%20of%20research.). After learning about the topic in early high school, I knew I wanted to pursue neuroscience as a career. I wanted to make the best financial decision for my family and me, so I decided to focus on universities in Florida. At the time, most Florida universities did not offer a dedicated neuroscience program, but rather degrees in related topics with a focus in neuroscience. I preferred my undergraduate education to focus on neuroscience as a discipline, rather than a branch of other scientific fields.\nI also chose FSU for its beautiful and walkable campus. FSU’s beauty stood out during my touring process. Tallahassee has been full of activities to do and amazing memories to make. I have been fortunate to build a meaningful, dependable community here that I do not believe I could have found anywhere else.\nHow have FSU’s programs supported your academic accomplishments?\nOne of my most significant accomplishments at FSU is my research project within Dr. Eckel’s lab. My project examines a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic, the popular weight loss drug) and its effects on dysregulated eating in a pre-clinical rat model of binge eating. Available treatments for bulimic syndromes are limited, making my study significant, as it may help identify GLP-1 as a novel therapeutic target for reducing binge eating in individuals with bulimic syndromes. I was awarded an IDEA grant, which has significantly advanced my research endeavors. This generous funding has allowed me to fully immerse myself in my research goals. I am fortunate to be part of an institution that offers such a wealth of funding opportunities for students to pursue their academic and professional aspirations.\nWhat is one of your most rewarding community service experiences?\nBeyond the classroom, I have been an Ignite Fellow for the past two years. The Ignite Fellowship is a tutoring program provided by Teach for America. As a tutor, I lead a small group of K-8 students through virtual math or reading lessons each semester. I create weekly lesson plans based on students’ weaknesses and school learning guidelines. I focus on building a welcoming environment to foster strong, meaningful relationships, allowing my students to fully embrace learning. It is incredibly rewarding to see students who were once shy when introducing themselves now eagerly shouting out answers before I even finish reading the practice questions.\nHow would you describe your impact on FSU students and beyond?\nI believe my strong commitment to research serves as a model for underclassmen, demonstrating the potential of research opportunities at FSU. I envision myself as a guide for my peers, informing them about the many opportunities available once they engage in research.\nMy work aims to expand existing literature on treatments for bulimic syndromes, addressing their impact on both the local community and individuals worldwide. As a tutor, I contribute to the educational system locally and beyond by offering personalized support to young students. Most of the students I tutor are people of color or from lower-income communities and lack access to essential learning resources. My purpose is to bridge this gap and offer an enriching learning experience. By doing so, I help ensure that all students have the opportunity to achieve academic success both now and in the future.",
