  "text": "By Louise Baltruschat Hollis\nUnexpected, not as planned but still the best day of our lives!\nFaye and Niall\nTheir day may have been short and sweet, but it was certainly full of heart. WWW readers Faye and Niall were due to host their wedding on the 21st March 2020, sadly their venue understandably cancelled their reception the night before, after they had checked into the venue on the Friday night. COVID19 meant that their dream day had to be cancelled and their intimate micro wedding ceremony took place just before the lockdown restrictions in the UK were put into place. My heart really goes out to these two and their loved ones, what an awfully heartbreaking moment for them, especially the night before their big day. But what troopers they are, they seized the day, embraced the situation and went ahead with their beautiful ceremony regardless. Inspirational indeed!\nThese images kindly sent to me by Carn Patrick clearly demonstrate how much love and affection was in the air. Smiles from ear to ear and beautiful touches and attire all round were captured so beautifully. I adore Faye’s elegant gown and Niall’s kilt and the bountiful bridal bouquet. If their ceremony is anything to go by, their reception when it takes place when wedding restrictions here in the UK are lifted, is sure to be spectacular! If you can take anything from Faye and Niall’s experience it’s to be sure to remember that your wedding is about the two of you and the beginning of your marriage. After all that’s all that really matters, the love.\nI moved to Scotland in Summer 2014 and met Niall in the Autumn that year. We love walking in the hills in Aberdeenshire and that’s where he proposed on 9th February 2018. We were on a hill completely alone and it was perfect. He knew if he had planned something different to our usual walks I’d have definitely guessed that something was going on 😉\nWe wanted a classic wedding with a mix of Scottish and English traditions and features. From thistles in the flowers, to a traditional English church to a Ceilidh band at the evening reception.\nWe loved every part of the planning process! From the cake tasting to the church visits, however all the planning in the world couldn’t have stopped our “dream” wedding being changed to something completely different due to our venue understandably cancelling the night before our wedding because of Covid-19.\nValerie Rose – they were perfect. I couldn’t stop crying when I saw my bouquet!\n25, 000\nWynyard Hall, Billingham on Tees (or that’s where we will have our celebration once all this isolation is over with!).\nChanged to – Thorpe Thewles church and my parents house for a mini celebration!\nUnfortunately we couldn’t have any! It was a very simple ceremony and we still managed to have the bells at the church rung for us when we left.\nThe Designer Cake Company – four tiers of caramel apple, chocolate orange and white chocolate lemon and blueberry.\nCarn Patrick – Carn was unbelievable. Especially with such drastic changes last minute. He made sure he captured so many photos of our altered ceremony. By looking at them you can’t tell it wasn’t an ordinary wedding!\nOnce our celebration can happen we will be able to give out our favours and have all the details that we so wanted on the day at Wynyard Hall. We have beautiful stationery made by Rosewood Co that I can’t wait to use!\nMy dress was a simple Pronovias Atelier dress made from crepe with slight beading on the neckline. My Mam chose it for me to try on as she thought it best suited me… turns out she was right! I bought it from Perfect Bridal Rooms in Aberdeen which is close to where Niall and I live for easier fittings! My shoes were Jimmy Choo and earrings were from Latelita.\nNiall’s kilt is his Sutherland tartan and his jacket and accessories are from Georgian Dress Hire also in Aberdeen.\nHair colour – Rob Smith at The Copper House, Middlesbrough\nHair up – Carly Taylor Bridal Hair\nMake Up – Heather Francesca Make Up Studio\nNails – Nails by Kate Olivia\nTo be confirmed! We had booked to go to America in June 2020….hopefully this can still go ahead but we’ve become the masters of adapting!!\nThere were meant to be five groomsmen but due to restrictions on the day only my younger brother could be in the church! He wore a kilt also by Georgian Dress Hire.\nAgain there were meant to be five bridesmaids but Niall’s older sister could be our only one in the church. Her dress was a sage green pleated halter neck dress by Oasis.\nBeing married in front of just our immediate family wasn’t what we expected but it somehow made it feel so special.\nDon’t sweat the small stuff honestly! Once our venue had cancelled on us it became so clear that all we wanted to do was marry each other and nothing else seemed to matter!\nPhotographer\nCarn Patrick\nFlowers\nValerie Rose\nStationery\nRosewood Co\nCake\nThe Designer Cake Company\nMakeup\nHaircut\nThe Copper House\nHair Stylist\nCarly Taylor Bridal Hair\nNails\nOlivia Kate Beauty Nails\nWow, what an emotional and very special story. How fantastic of the local vicar to step in last minute too! It’s lovely to see that some other loved ones were able to pop by for their confetti moment post ceremony.\nFaye and Niall I cannot thank you enough for kindly sharing your really beautiful wedding day. I am really excited to see how your reception turns out when it happens and that you also have the most wonderful honeymoon when you are able to. I have a funny feeling it’s going to be a really incredible celebration xo Lou\nLeave a Reply\nWant In On My Happy Wedding Letter?\nJoin over a thousand engaged couples (and counting) who have snagged my fun no-nonsense regular wedding advice and inspo straight to their inbox.
