  "text": "OOLOGAH, Okla. — An 11-year-old from Oologah battling leukemia is holding a toy drive for kids at his hospital. Jaxon Crabb has been battling cancer for over a year. He was diagnosed with Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL). He’s on a three-year treatment plan and just finished his first year. FOX23 got the chance to speak with Jaxon and his family about his story and the toy drive. “Jaxon was just starting fifth grade last August and developed a rash and a fever, and after an urgent care visit, a pediatrician visit, we ultimately landed at Saint Francis on a Thursday evening,” said Chancy Crabb, Jaxon’s mom. “By Saturday morning, had a leukemia diagnosis, and by Monday afternoon we were on our way to St. Jude in Memphis.\" “My world literally changed overnight,” Jaxon said. Jaxon spent time at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Now, he gets weekly treatment at a St. Jude affiliated clinic at Saint Francis in Tulsa, where there are dozens of kids receiving cancer treatment. While Jaxon was inpatient for nine days at Saint Francis, which ended last Friday, he noticed there weren’t enough toys for all the kids there. That gave him the idea to start a toy drive, which he announced last weekend. \"They couldn't find me any toys for my last day, so I thought why don't we donate some toys, because I don't want other kids to be like that,” Jaxon said. “So, we decided to put this toy drive together and get some donations to send over.” Chancy said they put together an Amazon Wish List for the hospital. “We threw together an Amazon Wish List of some of the most common things that the hospital needs, Legos, Play-Doh, coloring, drawing stuff, just the most common things they ask for and things kids want to do while they're there,” she said. Overnight, they got more than 400 packages on their doorstep. “It was really cool, and it just shows how many people were following Jaxon's story and how many people want to pitch in and help and be supportive of these kids,” Chancy said. “Because this is the hardest time of their lives, and they need that.” Four days later, they now have more than 700 toys. Jaxon and his sister, Savanna, are having fun unboxing them every day. “It shows that people care,” Jaxon said. They're asking people to donate to help kids like Jaxon receiving cancer treatment at any local hospital. Chancy said toys really make a difference for these kids. “To brighten their day and just give them something to look forward to and something to do, it makes a massive difference for these kids,” she said. “We've seen that for 14 months with our own. And if he's having a long day in the hospital and a nurse can find a Lego set and entertain him for a little bit, it’s truly not just a toy.” Jaxon’s dad, Joe Crabb, said it’s been a humbling experience. “Everyone's typically going through everyday life, you're busy, and you know, when everything in our immediate world stops, and seeing these kids go through what they're going through and so forth, is pretty humbling and eye awakening that this stuff does happen to people,” he said. FOX23 asked what message they want to get out there for this toy drive. “That these kids in the hospital, they need something to do,” Jaxon said. “So, why don't we send them something? Even after the toy drive, they can just send it themselves.\" Jaxon’s toy drive runs through Nov. 22. They plan to deliver all the toys on that following Friday. They will bring them to Saint Francis, St. Jude clinics and every hospital they can that shares the same need. If they receive donations after Nov. 22, they said they will still donate them as they come in.
