  "text": "[미용성형 공화국의 그림자] Some nurses, including beauty treatments, are allowed to perform cosmetic procedures\nSome say, “Impose a special consumption tax on aesthetic medicine.”\nThere is also an argument that “we must invest in essential medical support.”\n“Discuss a personalized treatment plan with a registered aesthetic nurse.”\nUnion Station Station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the 16th of last month (local time). A promotional message like this was hung at a beauty clinic in a historic underground shopping mall. Inside, two or three white women were waiting to receive a procedure from a nurse.\nRecently, it has been pointed out in the government and medical circles that the problem of the ‘cosmetic plastic surgery republic’ will be resolved only by changing the reality in which general practitioners who have just graduated from medical school earn about 15 million won per month at aesthetic clinics, making more money than specialists in essential medicine.\nOne of the solutions is ‘opening beauty medicine’. In the Canadian province of Ontario, some qualified nurses are allowed to independently perform cosmetic procedures such as Botox injections. In places like the United States and Australia, nurses can perform cosmetic procedures on a limited basis.\nHowever, it is pointed out that in order to prevent controversy over poor procedures like network beauty clinics from erupting, qualifications should be opened but quality should be strictly controlled. In the UK, where nurses are allowed to perform cosmetic procedures, the Quality Commission (CQC), an independent organization, manages medical practices, including cosmetic procedures, to ensure that they do not harm patient safety.\nThere is also an opinion to impose a special consumption tax on aesthetic medicine and use it to support essential medical care. Jeong Jae-hoon, a professor of preventive medicine at Korea University, said, “General practitioners working in aesthetic medicine also use the healthcare system while receiving education and obtaining a medical license.” He added, “We can pay more taxes to make this system sustainable and invest it in essential healthcare.” “There is,” he said. However, with the introduction of the special consumption tax, it is pointed out that aesthetic medicine is already paying the value-added tax (10%), which is exempted for general medical treatment. There are also concerns that imposing additional taxes will only increase the burden on consumers.\nThe Korean government announced its policy to improve the ‘focus on cosmetic surgery’ and to allow some cosmetic procedures, such as Botox and fillers, to be performed without a doctor’s license in the essential medical package announced in February this year. At the time, Park Min-soo, Second Vice Minister of Health and Welfare, said, “The problem of essential medical care is that doctors are leaving the cosmetic surgery market with high income and good work-life balance,” and emphasized that they would lower expected income through competition. However, doctors immediately opposed this, saying, “patient safety cannot be guaranteed.” The government only reaffirmed the general openness policy in the ‘First Implementation Plan for Medical Reform’ released in August this year, but is not speeding up discussions on the specific scope of openness.\nReporter Park Gyeong-min mean@donga.com\nToronto = Reporter Cho Yu-ra jyr0101@donga.com\ngreat\n0 dog\nI’m sad\n0 dog\nI’m angry\n0 dog\nI recommend it\ndog\nHot news now",
