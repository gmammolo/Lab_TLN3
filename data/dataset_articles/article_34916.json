  "text": "Nothing replaces blood, so donating is an essential gesture. In France, more than a million patients are treated each year and need it.\nThis Tuesday, November 5, solidarity was in the spotlight in Trèbes , where the French Blood Establishment (EFS) and the Blood Donor Association saw generations of donors respond to their call.\nA generous gesture 58 people including 51 donors and 5 new ones! All participants congratulated the volunteers of the Amicale de Trèbes for their good humor and their musical tastes which never cease to create a very friendly atmosphere.\nGrowing participation Under the dynamic presidency of Christophe Saint-Marc, the Association of Trebean Blood Donors has doubled its participation. Seven years ago, the first collection had 29 donors, while the penultimate brought together more than 60.\nChristophe Saint-Marc, Jean-Claude Hariot-Lassiva, and Marie de Freitas, the “three musketeers” of the association, worked tirelessly to promote the importance of collections in Trèbes and its surroundings. Their commitment made it possible to reach more than thirty municipalities, supported by local media coverage.\nIn recognition of this enthusiasm, EFS Occitanie has decided to add a fourth annual collection in Trèbes for 2025: they will now take place in February, June, September and December.\nA new partnership: Today’s collection also welcomed Suzanne Devèze, volunteer from the League Against Cancer, to raise awareness of the links between blood donations and cancer treatments.\n“Blood donation is crucial for 40% of people with cancer, especially those requiring transfusions due to chemotherapy,” she recalled.",
