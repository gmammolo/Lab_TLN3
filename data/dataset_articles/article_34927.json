  "text": "Sanwo-Olu’s wife launches TB screening in Lagos council 8th November 2024 First Lady of Lagos State, Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu\nBy Gbenga Oloniniran Kindly share this story:\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready... The Wife of Lagos State Governor, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu and the Chairman of the Epe Local Government Area, Princess Surah Animashaun will today (Friday) flag off a two-day tuberculosis screening campaign in the council. According to Animashaun, the campaign is necessary because a lack of awareness has continued to pose threats to the residents of the council, the state, and Nigeria at large. The council chair stated this during a press conference organised to usher in the campaign exercise, held at the Secretariat Chamber, Ita-Marun, Epe, Lagos State, on Thursday. She said the event with the theme “End TB, Stop TB,” featuring free blood pressure checks, blood sugar screening, free X-rays, and free TB screening exercises, will be held at the Epe LG Primary Healthcare Centre, Epe. She asked residents to converge and afford themselves the opportunity of the screening to eliminate and control the spread of tuberculosis in the council, state, and country at large.

She said “Those diseases are preventable and treatable, yet they continue to pose a threat due to a lack of awareness and access to medical services. “So this screening and awareness campaign will not only provide our people with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and their loved ones but also ensure that those affected receive the care and support they deserve.” The chairman lamented the rising scourge of tuberculosis and high blood pressure among many Nigerians and underscored the importance of the free screening programme.
