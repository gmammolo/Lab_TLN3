  "text": "Diabetes and AI: great opportunities, many challenges How digital tools are changing diabetes therapy and what this means for everyday life in clinics and practices, but also for people with diabetes mellitus, was discussed by around 200 experts from medicine, diabetes and nutritional counselling and industry at Fulda University of Applied Sciences. Under the title \"Insulin control, algorithms and AI - what does this mean for practice?\", the working group Diabetes + Technology (AGDT) of the German Diabetes Society (Deutsche Diabetes Gesellschaft e.V.) had invited participants to the 2024 annual conference. Professor Dr Claudia Eberle, conference president and co-organiser of the annual conference as well as a member of the AGDT advisory board, had brought the course to Fulda University of Applied Sciences. She was also responsible for the academic management of the annual conference. The organising team had put together a deliberately diverse program that highlighted the digital tools from different disciplines and with a view to different patient groups in order to take as comprehensive a look as possible at the new therapeutic approaches. In addition to AID systems, which enable automatic insulin dosing, the conference focussed on apps and DiGAs, one of Professor Eberle's research topics. DiGAs are also known as apps on prescription. The tools, which were conceived as digital assistants and established under Health Minister Spahn, have been available since 2020 but are still little used. Doctors and patients are currently discussing the opportunities and risks. The course provided healthcare professionals and the industry with academic evidence and experiences with the new digital tools, taking into account various specialist disciplines and patient groups. Patient-centred and therapeutically effective Professor Eberle made it clear that the great advantage lies in individualisation through patient-centred therapy support, which also makes it possible to address individual comorbidities, for example. \"University studies have shown that apps are therapeutically effective as a lifestyle intervention. They lower the HbA1c value without changing medication,\" explained the researcher, internist and diabetologist, who has herself conducted international academic studies on the subject. App support during pregnancy could even be used to reach the next generation. Their comorbidities caused by maternal gestational diabetes, for example neonatal hypoglycaemia (hypoglycaemia in newborns) and respiratory disorders, could be reduced with the use of an app, as could the number of deaths due to maternal gestational diabetes. However, it is not easy to keep track of the range of tools on offer. Thousands of health apps are available globally. It is therefore important to know that not all apps are the same. A distinction must be made between health apps, medical apps and apps as medical devices or DiGAs, says Professor Eberle. However, the market share of these certified apps is still very low at just 0.03 per cent. No substitute for self-management Presenters and participants agreed that digital assistants are ineffective without the willingness to self-manage. The active participation of patients is still required because, like any change in behaviour, apps and DiGAs also require a lot of work at the beginning. The central question of patient motivation therefore also arises when using digital technologies. Some voices criticised the fact that doctors were not involved enough in the digital tools. Other voices were in favour of seeing digital helpers as an opportunity to compensate for the shortage of therapists in view of the increasing number of older people who are living longer with chronic diseases and the simultaneous lack of staff and gaps in care. Fewer glucose fluctuations with AID With regard to AID systems, which currently focus heavily on type 1 diabetes, Professor Eberle showed that they can significantly reduce glucose fluctuations and hyperglycaemia compared to conventional pump therapy. University studies have ultimately shown no unforeseeable safety problems if the systems are individually appointed and therapeutically controlled. When used during pregnancy, for example, the premature birth rate can be reduced. AID systems, for example, combine the displayed real-time data from continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) with an insulin pump and thus enable automatic insulin dosing. Both systems are controlled by an algorithm that can be located on a smartphone, for example. As the system is in most cases subject to a rigid algorithm and therefore cannot adapt to the respective everyday challenges and cannot reliably look into the future, it is not really intelligent. Other contributions focused on topics such as measurement accuracy, as the same glycaemic state is currently mapped differently by different systems, EU guidelines and biological research. One thing remains to be said: The digital tools provide a lot of data that can be used to improve diabetes therapy and, above all, tailor it to the individual. For patients, however, diabetes was and remains a 24-hour job. For healthcare professionals, diabetes therapy is increasingly becoming a question of the right use of technology and support. The opportunities are great, as are the challenges in practice. [back](/en/)",
