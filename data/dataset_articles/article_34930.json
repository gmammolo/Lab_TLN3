  "text": "A regional nonprofit that helps keep our neighbors safe at home has recognized ChristianaCare for its generous partnership.\n[Good Neighbors Home Repair](https://www.goodneighborshomerepair.org/) thanked ChristianaCare for its financial support at the nonprofit’s Stories of Hope celebration on Oct. 24. Good Neighbors offers critical, no-cost home repair services to homeowners in need across parts of Chester and Lancaster counties in Pennsylvania and New Castle County in Delaware.\nChristianaCare’s support for Good Neighbors reflects a broader commitment to addressing the social, behavioral and environmental factors that impact health.\n“Together, we are building healthier communities.” — Bettina Tweardy Riveros\n“At ChristianaCare, we strive to deliver health, not just health care, to the people we serve,” said Bettina Tweardy Riveros, ChristianaCare’s chief health equity officer.\n“We recognize that we can’t do it alone, and that’s why we invest in organizations like Good Neighbors, empowering them to deepen their impact and bring positive change to one family at a time. Together, we are building healthier communities.”\n[Click here](https://christianacare.org/us/en/about-us/who-we-are/community-benefit#tabs-411b6be0f0-item-f8f3fd687a-tab) for more on ChristianaCare’s community benefit initiatives.\nGood Neighbors received a grant from ChristianaCare’s Community Investment Fund, which supports partnerships with nonprofit organizations to build the collective capacity of communities to address non-medical drivers of health.\nSupport from ChristianaCare has allowed Good Neighbors to make important home modifications for patients referred by our caregivers.\nBy adding handrails, ramps, bathroom grab bars and other safety features, Good Neighbors, based in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, helps seniors, people with disabilities and others recovering from illness live safely and stay independent in their homes.\n“This partnership allows us to make these repairs, helping people steadily recover.” — Brad Dunn\n“Thanks to ChristianaCare’s support, we’re able to help people who have just come home from the hospital or are facing new health challenges,” said Good Neighbors Advancement Director Brad Dunn.\n“Many of them are returning to homes with safety issues that they can’t afford to fix. This partnership allows us to make these repairs, helping people steadily recover and maintain their quality of life, so they can focus on healing and safely moving forward.”",
