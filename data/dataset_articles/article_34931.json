From sweet potato pie to Mac n cheese casserole, and biscuits with mushroom gravy, these recipes will steal the show on Thanksgiving!\nWe also highly recommend downloading the Food Monster App — with over 15,000 delicious recipes it is the largest meatless, vegan, plant-based, and allergy-friendly recipe resource to help you get healthy!\n1. BBQ Seitan Ribs Source: Seitan Ribs\nThese lip-smacking strips of deliciousness are messy and fun to eat. Tender, meaty homemade Seitan Ribs from VEGANIZE IT! are slathered in sticky homemade barbecue sauce, seared, and then baked until slightly crisp and caramelized around the edges. Serve these with a side of potato salad and coleslaw.\n2. Jalapeño Hush Puppies Source: Jalapeño Hush Puppies\nSome of you may be wondering, what the heck is a hush puppy? It’s a fried corn dog, with no dog, and whatever you else would like to pack in there! Sounds underwhelming, but it’s so good. Some days you just need something fried and indulgent, and Gabrielle St. Claire ‘s Jalapeño Hush Puppies are the answer.\nGratitude: Plant-Based Thanksgiving Cookbook No other holiday captures the spirit of home cooking the way Thanksgiving does. This is why you need the ultimate Thanksgiving cookbook, One Green Planet’s Gratitude: Plant-Based Recipes to Create your own Thanksgiving Tradition ! In the cookbook, you’ll find our 100 most popular plant-based Thanksgiving recipes like Soft Baked Pumpkin Doughnuts, Spiced Apple Cake with Cashew Frosting, Sweet Potato Chocolate Pudding with Nut Crumble Topping, Cinnamon Apple Hand Pies, and hearty entrees like Roast Root Vegetable Stack With Dukkah, Vegducken: Butternut Squash Stuffed With Eggplant, Zucchini, and a Mushroom Lentil Stuffing, and Seitan Roast With Sausage and Pear Stuffing and Apple Cider Gravy and so much more!\n3. Cheesy Cauliflower Baked Shells With Breadcrumbs Source: Cheesy Cauliflower Baked Shells With Breadcrumbs\nIn Lisa Dawn Angerame ‘s Cauliflower Baked Shells recipe, a cheesy, tangy cauliflower sauce encases shell pasta and then is baked under a thick, crusty layer of breadcrumbs. It’s the perfect recipe for a date night or a side to a holiday party feast. It’s fancy enough to impress but easy and simple enough to put together at the last minute.\n4. Smoky Southern Collard Greens Source: Smoky Southern Collard Greens\nComfort food at its finest! Warm up your meal with a bowl of these spicy, healthy, oil-free Smoky Southern Collard Greens by Molly Patrick .\n5. Sweet Potato Pie Source: Sweet Potato Pie\nSweet potato steals the spotlight from pumpkin in this wonderful Sweet Potato Pie by Leah Moldowan . Top it with pecans and coconut whipped cream to really wow your guests.\n6. Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese Casserole Source: Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese Casserole\nThis Butternut Squash Mac and Cheese Casserole by Gabrielle St. Claire is comfort food heaven. Sweet, creamy butternut squash is paired with decadently cheesy macaroni elbows and sealed with a unique flatbread topping. The finishing touches put it over the top, from the smoky Shiitake bacon to the red pepper flakes and maple syrup. Normally, we’d say this casserole is perfect to make for a week of easy meals, but we know this one will only last a few days.\n7. Cornbread Source: Cornbread\nThis delicious cornbread by Mitra Shirmohammadi is super fluffy, crumbly, and moist! It’s also not overly sweet, but just enough to satisfy a sweet craving, and goes perfectly with savory dishes.\n8. Sweet Potato Biscuits Source: Sweet Potato Biscuits\nThese Sweet Potato Biscuits by Kayli Dice are straight-up amazing. They are tender, doughy, and slightly sweet. And they are insanely easy to whip up. Eat them hot out of the oven and dunked in a bowl of soup or chili.\n9. Sweet Potato Pie Tartlets Source: Sweet Potato Pie Tartlets\nOn a sweet pecan crust sits a smooth sweet potato filling that tastes just like caramel. Sweet molasses brings a rich depth of flavor to these little Sweet Potato Pie Tartlets by Michaell Johnson . Topped with cool coconut whipped cream and freshly grated lemon zest, these are the perfect treat to enjoy on a cold day while wrapped in a fluffy blanket with a hot cup of tea.\n10. Biscuits and Mushroom Gravy Source: Biscuits and Mushroom Gravy\nLife can taste good with these fluffy, soft, gluten-free Biscuits by Molly Patrick accompanied with mushroom gravy. It’s the ultimate comfort food side that will leave you craving for more. These are great for dinner parties, but also make great leftover snacks/sides for yourself.\n11. Southwestern Style Grits Source: Southwestern Style Grits\nYou can’t have a Southern celebration and not have some grits. These Southwestern Style Grits by Ashley Flitter are made creamy with vegan cheese and sour cream. A little jalapeno adds a spicy kick.\n12. Chili Cornbread Casserole Source: Chili Cornbread Casserole\nThe only thing more delicious than golden cornbread dipped in chili is a Chili Cornbread Casserole by Melanie Sorrentino ! The hearty chili is made with rice, kidney beans, crushed tomatoes, and plenty of seasoning. As is, this recipe is ridiculously easy and minimalist. Add some sautéed green peppers and onions into the chili mix if you want to amp it up a bit.\n13. Coconut Milk Braised Collard Greens Source: Coconut Milk Braised Collard Greens\nTraditionally a southern dish, collard greens are a great way to get your daily dose of green, leafy, veggies. This Coconut Milk Braised Collard Greens recipe by Courtney West is great as a main course or alongside an entrée. Garlic, pepper, cumin, and mustard seeds give this recipe a great spice, while coconut balances it out with a delicious creaminess. Customize this dish with your own spice combination, or serve it over quinoa!\n14. Vegan Cornbread Source: Vegan Cornbread\nThis is a nice Vegan Cornbread recipe by Karielyn Tillman that is quite moist and easy to make. You probably already have all the ingredients on hand, except cornmeal, unless you use it regularly. The only thing I use it for is to make cornbread so that’s the only reason I already had some. I don’t know why, but the majority of the time I make it for breakfast (is that weird?) and rarely as a side dish to a meal like a chili. This cornbread is dense in texture and not sweet cornbread, but you could easily make it as sweet as you like just by adjusting the amount of maple syrup in the recipe.\n15. Smoky Pumpkin Grits with Shitake Mushrooms in Kale Pesto Cream Sauce Source: Smoky Pumpkin Grits with Shitake Mushrooms in Kale Pesto Cream Sauce\nSimple as it is, this Smoky Pumpkin Grits with Shitake Mushrooms in Kale Pesto Cream Sauce by Betsy DiJulio is one of the tastiest and most satisfying dishes you will ever eat. Perfect for a fall dinner or brunch, it is both rustic and refined. The smoked paprika in the grits and the smoked almonds in the pesto are a perfect pairing. Add to that the smokey notes of Chardonnay, and you have a tasty trinity indeed. Visually, it is also appealing with the warm, golden-toned grits setting off the creamy green-flecked mushrooms to a delicious advantage.\nEasy Ways to Help the Planet:\nEat Less Meat: Download Food Monster , the largest plant-based recipe app on the App Store, to help reduce your environmental footprint, save animals and get healthy.
