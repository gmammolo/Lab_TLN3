  "text": "HUNTINGTON — St. Mary’s Medical Center marked its first century of service Wednesday evening in Huntington. As part of the centennial celebration, St. Mary’s inducted former CEO Michael Sellards and the Pallottine Missionary Sisters into the St. Mary’s Wall of Fame, honoring their contributions to the hospital and community. \"It's a wonderful honor,\" said Sellards, who was president and CEO for 19 years before retiring in 2019. \"I was part of the leadership team that established the Palatine Foundation, the St. Mary's Foundation and negotiated the purchase of the former grocery store building, which is today the St. Mary's Conference Center, and converted it into the educational center that it is today.\" The event took place in the St. Mary’s Conference Center in the 2800 block of 5th Avenue. It included remarks from hospital leadership, a commemorative ceremony with a special video premiere of the Pallottine Sisters and a dinner reception. Sister Danuta Przybylek, Pallottine Missionary Sisters chairwoman, who is on the Pallottine Foundation Board of Trustees, called the honor humbling. \"It evokes memories of the past struggles and successes, and emphasizes the sisters' faith-based vocation, particularly in health care,\" she said. \"The community, though institutionally recognized, is rooted in faith and service. It is a personal honor to be part of a long legacy that I have been a part of as a younger member from Poland.\" For 100 years, the Pallottine Missionary Sisters provided the foundation for what is today the largest tertiary care hospital in the Tri-State region and Cabell County's largest private employer. The sisters said they were inspired by founder St. Vincent Pallotti's motto, \"The Love of Christ Impels Us,\" the Pallottines came to America from Germany in 1912. On Nov. 6, 1924, the sisters were ready to open their 35-bed hospital and place it under the protection of Mary, the Mother of God. The next day, St. Mary's admitted its first patient, a charity case, the beginning of the hospital's long tradition of caring for the poor. A Centennial Mass took place early in the evening in the St. Mary’s Chapel with The Most Rev. Mark Brennan, bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Angie Swearingen, St. Mary's Medical Center's chief operating officer, said Wednesday night's events were for honoring its founders and former leader for their influence on health care in the community. \"As part of Marshall Health Network, the organization aims to continue the sisters' mission by addressing health care disparities, public health issues and fostering compassion,\" she said. \"They have emphasized the importance of investing in the community and their goal is to advance health, inspire hope and serve for the next century.\" St. Mary's Medical Center is one of Cabell County's largest private employers with over 2,600 employees and, at 413 beds, is among the largest health care facilities in West Virginia. As a teaching facility associated with the Joan C. Edwards Marshall University School of Medicine, St. Mary's trains medical residents in several specialties. The hospital campus is home to the St. Mary's School of Nursing, the St. Mary's School of Medical Imaging and the St. Mary’s School of Respiratory Care. All three programs are associated with Marshall University.",
