  "text": "Wife of the Lagos State Governor, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu , has advocated for proper waste management, especially in markets, to ensure a cleaner Lagos and better living for residents.\nMrs. Sanwo-Olu spoke at the Sabo Ultra-Modern Market Yaba, during a one-day seminar on Sanitisation and Security for Market Leaders in Yaba Local Council Development Area.\nThe seminar, organised by the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Rural Development, was to sensitise leaders on measures to prevent any forms of hazards within the markets.\nThe theme was ‘Improving Waste Management and Public Health in Markets: A Recipe for Economic Growth and Prosperity in Lagos Central Senatorial District’.\nThe governor’s wife explained that her office has continues to re-echo the importance of hygiene, safety and security in marketplaces, while supporting several initiatives of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration towards promoting market sanitation and safety.\nAccording to her, markets are the lifeblood of the economy that provides essential goods and services, but also posing environmental and health risks when people refuse to adhere to environmental guidelines on proper Waste Management.\nShe said: “Without proper waste management, we risk the possibility of contamination of food and water, air and water pollution, which do not only threaten the lives of consumers, but also the lives of traders.\n“But we can change the narrative by adhering strictly to guidelines which would help in converting waste to wealth when properly done. The Lagos of our dream and the 21St Century Economy we desire in Lagos would only be possible when we religiously adhere to the guidelines on proper waste disposal and recycling in our markets.",
