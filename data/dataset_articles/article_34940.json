  "text": "African Society for Laboratory Medicine’s (ASLM’s) Chief Executive Officer, Nqobile Ndlovu, has urged African nations to invest in research and development in medical diagnostics laboratories.\nNdlovu stressed this during an online interview with journalists at the inaugural ASLM Diagnostics Convention 2024 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire.\nHe noted that African countries need to devote resources to research in medical diagnostics to tackle health challenges.\nHe said advanced countries have improved medical diagnostics through research and development.\nNdlovu noted that some African countries like Uganda, South Africa, Kenya, Morocco have made efforts to manufacture diagnostics, making the continent self-sufficient.\nRelated News However, he said there were still challenges, including infrastructure for effective testing, funding for modern equipment and technologies, regulatory impediments, and workforce issues.\nNdlovu appealed to the media to join advocacy efforts to educate African communities about the value of medical diagnostics laboratories.\nASLM’s convention brought together over 300 health leaders, policymakers, laboratory professionals, researchers, civil society, and industry partners to address challenges and innovations in diagnostics.\nThe convention is to transform diagnostic systems in Africa by harnessing innovation and quality assurance to elevate equity and excellence.",
