  "text": "The Federal Government has launched free Caesarean Section for Nigerian women who need the procedure, especially the poor and the vulnerable.\nCaesarean Section is a surgical procedure that involves delivering a baby through incisions on the mother’s abdomen and uterus.\nThe initiative, according to the government, is in furtherance of its commitment to reducing maternal and newborn mortality across Nigeria.\nThe Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Prof. Muhammad Pate , announced this yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing three-day Nigeria Health Sector-Wide Joint Annual Review.\nThe announcement came on the heels of the launch of the Maternal Mortality Reduction Innovation Initiative.\nThe Joint Annual Health Review aims to conduct a thorough assessment of Nigeria’s healthcare system, identifying challenges and implementing impactful solutions to ease both the physical and financial burdens on our people.\nConfirming this on the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Pate said: “No woman should lose her life simply because she can’t afford a C-section.”\nThe tweet reads: “In a powerful move, Coordinating Minister @muhammadpate just announced that Cesarean Sections for all Nigerian women who need them will now be FREE!”\nRelated News The minister added that the initiative would provide free cesarean sections for eligible poor and vulnerable women, available through public and private facilities empanelled by the National Health Insurance Authority.\n“By removing financial barriers to this life-saving procedure, we ensure that no woman in need is denied critical care due to cost. Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high, with 172 local governments contributing to over 50 per cent of maternal deaths.\n“By focusing resources on these high-burden areas, MAMII (Maternal Mortality-Reduction Innovation and Initiatives) will address the greatest areas of need. The NHIA (National Health Insurance Authority), in collaboration with the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, and State Health Insurance Agencies, will manage the reimbursement process, ensuring that providers across both sectors can deliver these essential services sustainably.\n“Community health workers play a crucial role in this mission, in line with Mr. President’s initiative to onboard 120,000 additional health workers to support primary care across Nigeria. These workers are essential in generating demand for maternal care services within communities, educating families on the importance of antenatal care and ensuring that mothers are informed about available services.\n“In rural and underserved areas, where accessing healthcare facilities remain a challenge, community health workers act as vital links between families and the healthcare system, bringing lifesaving information and support to their doorsteps.\n“In these same areas, the National Emergency Medical Service and Ambulance System @Fmohnigeria have been revitalized to provide timely transport for emergencies, bridging a key gap in both maternal and newborn care by bringing emergency services closer to those who need them most,” he added.\nPate acknowledged that the initiative was made possible through the essential support of development partners, whose resources and expertise align with Nigeria’s health priorities.",
