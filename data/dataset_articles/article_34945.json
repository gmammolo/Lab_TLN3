  "text": "The National Tribune The National Tribune The National Tribune Politics 8 Nov 2024 11:12 am AEST Date Time Share WA Health Excellence Awards winners unveiled Aboriginal health worker Jerry Morrison honoured for lifetime commitment to care Dr Danish Mahmud crowned 7News Health Hero, nominated by a patient An Armadale endocrinologist who changed a woman’s life with a rare diagnosis, and an exceptional Aboriginal health worker are among those to take top honours in Western Australia’s premier health awards.\nHeld last night, the WA Health Excellence Awards 2024 showcased the exceptional achievements of Western Australian health professionals.\nSelected from almost 200 nominations and 44 finalists, 13 winners were celebrated for providing high-quality and compassionate healthcare to the WA community.\nRecognising an individual with remarkable leadership ability and impact in advancing healthcare, the Minister for Health’s Award was presented to Jerry Morrison.\nStarting as an orderly at Princess Margaret Hospital in 1984, Mr Morrison has grown his career over four decades and is now a Senior Aboriginal Health Worker at Derby Hospital, and a vital member of its cardiology department.\nHe was acknowledged for his lifetime commitment to healthcare, and his ability to build trust and rapport with patients in a culturally-safe way.\nIntroduced last year, the 7NEWS Health Hero award gives Western Australians the chance to nominate a healthcare champion.\nOut of almost 100 nominations, Armadale Health Service endocrinologist, Dr Danish Mahmud, was named 2024 Health Hero.\nDr Mahmud was nominated by a female patient whose life was transformed when he diagnosed her with Cushing’s disease, a rare hormonal condition which causes the body to produce too much of the stress hormone cortisol.\nBefore being cared for by Dr Mahmud, she suffered debilitating symptoms and pain for eight years.\nIn her nomination she remarked, “He truly is a caring and intricate health professional like no other.”\nWA Health’s Director General’s Award was bestowed on South Metropolitan Health Service and PathWest’s Virtual Immunology Clinic for General Practice.\nSince January 2022, the service has provided patients with timely and equitable access to specialist immunology care, especially for those whose would otherwise have difficulty attending specialist appointments.\nAs stated by Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:\n“Our healthcare system is only as strong as the people who work in it, and these awards shine a light on the individuals and teams who go above and beyond every day.\n“These healthcare workers work to improve the health outcomes of all Western Australians.\n“The winners have truly made a difference in our health system and their commitment to patients truly inspires us all and sets a high standard for care in the State.”\nSource & references /Public Release.
