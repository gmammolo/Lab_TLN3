  "text": "Department of Health People in South Australia’s Mid North region have access to free, walk-in mental health support and care with the opening of a new Port Pirie Medicare Mental Health Centre.\nLocated at 129 Ellen Street, the new centre will provide on-the-spot support for people in distress and ongoing care for more complex mental health needs. \nStaffed by a multidisciplinary care team, including qualified mental health professionals, social workers, nurses, and peer support workers, it will provide wrap around support and care across extended hours.\nTo respond to growing need, the Albanese Labor Government is rolling out 61 Medicare Mental Health Centres across the country, including five in South Australia. \nThere are 28 Medicare Mental Health Centres open across Australia. Port Pirie is the fourth centre to open in South Australia and joins other services located in Mount Gambier, Elizabeth and Adelaide (Urgent Mental Health Care Centre). The centre located in Mount Barker is expected to open in the coming months.\nTo boost access to specialist care, the government is investing an additional $29.9 million to provide access to psychologists and psychiatrists on call for every centre.\nThe Port Pirie Medicare Mental Health Centre is funded by the Albanese Labor Government, commissioned by Country SA Primary Health Network, and operated by Neami National.\nAnyone who would prefer online support can call 1800 595 212 to talk to an experienced professional or receive a referral to a service that meets their needs. \nQuotes attributable to Assistant Minister McBride:\n“We want every Australian, no matter where they live, to have access to quality mental health care.\n“The new Port Pirie Medicare Mental Health Centre will mean locals in the mid north region of South Australia have greater access to support, closer to home. \n“The roll out of 61 Medicare Mental Health Centres, offering free, walk-in mental health support and care, is part of our plan to strengthen Medicare.”\nQuotes attributable to Minister Picton:\n“We know an Emergency Department isn’t always the most appropriate place for someone experiencing challenges with their mental health.\n“It’s important regional South Australians – not just people living in Adelaide – can receive the right mental health support when they need it.\n“This is another example of the Malinauskas and Albanese Governments working together to help improve access for mental health services in South Australia.”\nQuotes attributable to Geoff Brock, Member for Stuart :\n“Having a new, free, mental health centre in Port Pirie is a big boost to the local community.\n“Accessing mental health supports can be a challenge, especially in a regional city such as Port Pirie.\n“It is gratifying to see that the unit will be staffed by a multi-disciplinary team including qualified professionals who will be providing 1:1 consultations.\n“This will be greatly appreciated by those requiring these services.\n“Our community is going to benefit from having access to free mental health services.”",
