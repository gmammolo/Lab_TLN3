What do people need to know about Caregiver Nation?\nSHIRLEY TRAPANI: Caregiver Nation is a national strategy as part of the National Alliance for Caregiving . It&apos;s a nationwide initiative to bring states together in support of family caregivers.\nMIKE WARREN: Why is November such an important time to raise awareness about this?\nSHIRLEY TRAPANI: November is extremely important time because it is National Family Caregivers Month. And we are celebrating National Family Caregivers Month through our series of presentations and activities that we will be doing on behalf of Caregiver Nation throughout the year. But we&apos;re kicking it off starting next week with our first presenter.\nMIKE WARREN: You know, talk about these events that people should look out for this coming month.\nSHIRLEY TRAPANI: Yes. So our very first event is going to be held next Tuesday. We have a presenter named Jessica Cannon who will be speaking on the Caregiver&apos;s Trinity, which is a module on stress reduction techniques for family caregivers. She will be going through that module and in the future, throughout the next year, we will be holding a series of caregiver activities and events to support family caregivers.\nMORE HEALTH NEWS Fluoride: What is it and why is it added to our drinking water?
