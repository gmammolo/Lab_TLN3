  "text": "As the seventh China International Import Expo (CIIE) unfolds in Shanghai, it serves as a vibrant platform for numerous medical giants to showcase their latest innovations. Among these, global medical equipment provider Elekta stands out as a key player in the field of precision cancer treatment. With a steadfast commitment to improving patient outcomes and empowering the healthcare industry, Elekta has not only solidified its global presence but has also made significant investments in the rapidly expanding Chinese market. At this year's expo, Elekta is unveiling its cutting-edge solutions, emphasizing its vital role in advancing cancer care and reflecting a broader trend toward personalized and precise medical technologies. Legacy of innovation Founded in 1972, Elekta has established itself as a leader in the development of advanced technology for cancer treatment. Over the decades, the company has experienced remarkable growth, expanded its footprint across various continents and enhanced product offerings. Today, Elekta serves more than 7,000 medical institutions in more than 120 countries, benefiting more than 2 million patients annually. Elekta's commitment to innovation is evident in its evolution, from the groundbreaking Gamma Knife to a comprehensive range of precision radiation therapy products and solutions. \"We have launched several innovations in the past few years and we are now bringing online adaptive across all our solutions to increase value and patient outcomes,\" said Gustaf Salford, president and CEO of Elekta. Focus on the Chinese market As the second-largest medical market globally, China has become a focal point in Elekta's growth strategy, driven by the urgent demand for effective cancer treatment options. Since entering the Chinese market in 1982, Elekta has adhered to the principle of \"In China, For China\". This philosophy has guided the company in introducing high-standard international precision radiotherapy solutions and professional services while increasing its investment in the region to foster high-quality innovation. \"In China，we have R&D teams in Shanghai and also in Beijing, developing for the Chinese market but also the global markets,\" Salford said. He expressed optimism about the company's prospects, citing the nation's favorable business climate and promising healthcare industry. Elekta launched two strategic joint ventures: one with Sinopharm's China National Pharmaceutical Foreign Trade Corporation in 2023 and another with Beijing AnSheng, a leader in local medical informatics in 2024. These collaborations are designed to enhance the quality of radiation therapy while expanding the accessibility of Elekta's advanced solutions throughout China. \"We recognize that China is a significant driving force in global healthcare development, and we are proud of having operated here for more than 40 years. With the Chinese commitment to enhance cancer care, we believe this will continue to be a high-quality business environment for us, which will foster innovation in life science,\" Salford said.",
