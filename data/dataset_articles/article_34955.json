  "text": "POCATELLO — In honor of Native American Heritage Month, the Idaho Museum of Natural History on the Idaho State University Pocatello campus will offer free museum admission to enrolled tribal members during the month of November.\nIn 1990, President George H. W. Bush approved a joint resolution designating November as National American Indian Heritage Month. Free museum admission will be given to tribal members who present a valid tribal identification card.\nVisitors will enjoy the This is Idaho exhibit, which explores the wild mosaic of mountains, rivers, and plains offering majestic beauty and scattered resources that shape all who live here. Dinosaurs from the Mountain takes the viewer back 100 million years ago to the lush forests of the Wayan Formation where armored plant-eaters, tiny mammals, fox crocodiles, Idaho’s state dinosaur Oryctodromeus and Gigantoraptor roamed.\nAlso on display is “There is hope from the sea … ” a photo-ethnography of Zack Beal, a graduate student of the ISU Department of Anthropology and Languages under the direction of Kate Reedy, which explores the history and culture of Pacific cod fishing in the Shumagin Islands of Alaska.\nTake in the “The Art of Science” exhibition created with biological illustrations by Hannah Clawson, a senior studying biological sciences under the direction of Colden Baxter, professor.
