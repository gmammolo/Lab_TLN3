  "text": "By Neil Cooney ,\n7 hours ago Serving cold-pressed juices, acai bowls, smoothies, coffee, and more, Pure Green has 10 locations currently in operation in the state of Florida , and it’s continuing to expand its footprint. Next, the superfood brand is headed to St. Petersburg , where it will open at 1041 Central Ave .\n“Our story starts with our mission, which drives everything we do,” says the Pure Green website’s Our Story page . “We source the most nutrient-rich superfoods on the planet and we formulate them into products with unparalleled taste. At Pure Green, being mission-driven goes beyond simply having incredible products. Our mission is to build healthier communities around the globe by connecting people would superfoods.”\nThe menu opens with Superfood Smoothies like the Pure Green ( kale, spinach, mango, banana, pineapple, coconut water ), Mocha Cold Brew ( cold brew coffee, raw cacao, almond butter, banana, grass-fed whey protein, almond milk ), and the Purple Haze ( blueberries, strawberries, banana, spirulina, plant-based protein, coconut water ).\nWhat follows are selections of healthy choices like Acai and Pitaya Bowls, Steel-Cut Oatmeal Bowls, and Superfood Toasts—and finally, the brand’s Cold-Pressed Juices.\n“Pure Green cold pressed juice is nutrition just as nature intended,” says the Pure Green website . “The cold pressed juice process retains the vitamins, minerals and live enzymes from the fresh fruits and vegetables. Many of our cold pressed juice flavors contain up to five pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables in a single bottle. Pure Green is a proud supporter of local and organic farms and uses the highest quality ingredients.”\nAn opening date for the new location has not yet been announced. What Now reached out on Wednesday to franchisee Russell Browning to inquire about plans for the opening. Browning was not immediately available for comment.\nYou can keep up with Pure Green news by following @puregreen on Instagram.\nKeep up with What Now Tampa’s restaurant, retail, and real estate scoop by subscribing to our newsletter , liking us on Facebook , and following us on Twitter .
