  "text": "Photo by New York Times Consider this your dependable, blank-slate turkey burger that will always be juicy and well-seared no matter how you embellish it. Add ground spices, such as cumin or garlic powder; chopped herbs; or Worcestershire sauce or anchovies for umami — or leave the patty alone. With just a swipe of ketchup or mustard, it’ll hold its own. Grated zucchini keeps the burgers moist, mayonnaise helps bind and brown them, and salting only on the outside ensures that the meat stays tender. (For a cheeseburger, drape sliced cheese on the patties during the last 2 minutes of cooking and cover the pan.)\nTurkey Zucchini Burgers\nIngredients:\n• Neutral oil (such as grapeseed),\nfor greasing\n• 1 pound ground turkey\n• 1/2 cup coarsely grated unpeeled\nzucchini (from 1 small zucchini)\n• 1 tablespoon mayonnaise\n• Kosher salt (such as Diamond\nCrystal) and black pepper\n• Hamburger buns, toasted\n• Toppings and condiments, as\ndesired\nDirections:\nLightly grease a plate with neutral oil and set aside. In a medium bowl, mix together the turkey, zucchini and mayonnaise. Form 4 patties, each about 4 1/2 inches wide (about 5 ounces). Press a small dimple in the center of each patty, then place the burgers on the plate and refrigerate to firm up for at least 5 minutes (or keep them covered for up to 2 days).\nHeat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add about 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet to lightly coat. Generously season the tops of the patties with salt and pepper. Add the patties, seasoned-side down, to the skillet and cook until seared and dark brown, 3 to 5 minutes. (Don’t press down; that’ll release juices.) Season the tops generously with salt and pepper, then flip and cook until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes, turning the heat down as necessary to avoid scorching.\nTransfer to a clean plate and let rest for at least 5 minutes before building into a burger on the buns with desired toppings and condiments.\nTotal time: 30 minutes, serves 4.\n© 2024 The New York Times Company\nDon't miss out on what's happening!
