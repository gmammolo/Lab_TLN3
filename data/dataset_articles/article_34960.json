  "text": "Nashik: After a surge in dengue cases in the last three months, the city saw a decline in dengue cases in Oct, amounting to a total of 107 dengue cases reported in the month, a decrease from the 198 cases recorded in Sept.According to NMC officials, all measures are being taken to prevent dengue cases in Nashik. Intermittent rains until Oct 20 led to the accumulation of water in different places in the city. As a result, several mosquito breeding spots were created which led to a rise in dengue-positive cases between July and Oct. The officials further said that with the stoppage of rainfall in the second half of last month, the cases have started to decline.The city reported only 104 dengue-positive cases between Jan 1 and May 31 this calendar year. However, there was an outbreak of dengue from June this year. Nashik city reported 165 cases in June alone, but the cases increased to 434 in July alone, the highest cases to be recorded in one month in the current calendar year.In Aug, the city reported 198 dengue cases, and the same number of cases were recorded in Sept. However, the city reported the lowest 107 dengue cases since June.NMC officials further said they are taking all measures to prevent dengue cases in the city. The fogging and spraying activities are being carried out across the city in a bid to prevent dengue. NMC's health teams are also conducting surveys to find mosquito breeding spots and destroy them.",
