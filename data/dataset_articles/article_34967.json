  "text": "Green Pharma City In TG Very Good Initiative It will fuel growth of pharma sector in Telangana besides benefiting the State’s economy, says Aurobindo’s Madan Mohan Reddy Green Pharma City In TG Very Good Initiative The Telangana government has taken a right decision to go for pollution-free pharma city. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing units related to injectables and formulations will only come up there - M Madan Mohan Reddy, Whole-Time Director, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, tells Bizz Buzz Hyderabad: The Green Pharma City initiative taken up by the Telangana government is a very good initiative that will not only fuel the growth of the pharmaceutical sector in the State, but will also benefit the Telangana’s economy, said M Madan Mohan Reddy, Whole-Time Director, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, a city-based pharmaceutical major. “The Telangana government has taken the right decision to go for a pollution-free pharma city. Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturing units related to injectables and formulations will only come up there. The government said it will not allow any units related to APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) in the project,” Madan Mohan Reddy told Bizz Buzz. Madan Mohan Reddy along with representatives from other pharma majors Dr Reddy’s, Hetero Drugs, Laurus Labs, and MSN Pharmaceuticals, took part in a review meeting convened by Telangana IT and Industries Minister Duddilla Sridhar Babu on the progress of the Green Pharma City in Hyderabad on Wednesday. “The meeting went off very well. The government is taking up the project in a professional way. The officials are very positive in their approach. Green Pharma City will benefit the State in a big way,” he said. Asked about the investment that Aurobindo will make in the Green Pharma City, he said the company would finalise its strategy soon. “Location is good and close to the city. It offers a good opportunity for any pharma company to invest. But the project is still in early stages. The government will have to finalise the layout and we will have to sign MoUs,” Reddy explained. The proposed Green Pharma City will be a part of Future City to be developed by the State government in phases, according to Minister D Sridhar Babu. During the meeting with representatives from five pharma companies, he said that infrastructure would be developed to ensure uninterrupted water and electricity supply. The government would build a 300-feet highway from Kongara Kalan to the proposed Regional Ring Road. The tendering process for the road is likely to be concluded by June next year. To support pharma industries in the park, the State government will develop logistics parks, packaging zones, and dormitories for workers at a later date. Other infrastructure related proposals include a centralised steam (hot water vapour) supply through pipelines, which would eliminate the need for individual boilers for each industry, and a dedicated water supply system, which will be directly managed by Telangana Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TGIIC). Further, the government will soon announce industrial electricity policy. According to the official statement, the new pharma city will be ready for setting up units within a year and pharma majors will put up their manufacturing facilities in 50-acre plots initially. According to industry experts, an investment of Rs1,000 crore is required to put a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on a 50-acre site. It is said that the Telangana government will hold more consultations with the pharma industry representatives to attract more investments into the Hyderabad Green Pharma City.",
