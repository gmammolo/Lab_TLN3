  "text": "FDA commissioner urges clinicians to join fight against medical misinformation Dave Fornell | November 07, 2024 | Cardiovascular Business | Policy & Regulations\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Robert Califf, MD , is urging the clinical community to step up its efforts to counteract the widespread medical misinformation circulating on social media and other digital platforms.\nHe spoke with Cardiovascular Business at the recent TCT 2024 conference, where he emphasized the need for grassroots action by healthcare professionals. He asserted that the fight against misinformation is critical to safeguarding public health.\n\"This has been an issue that has been growing. Definitely the pandemic brought on a surge of misinformation, but that also coincided with the rapid growth of social media, big changes in the way digital infrastructure was built. So all this has culminated now in a tsunami of really bad information that's out there that's affecting people's health,\" Califf explained.",
