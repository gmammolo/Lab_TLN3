  "text": "Turn heads by mastering the art of blow drying for 3 show-stopping hairstyles! I was born in the 90s. So just like you, my mother controlled my mane for a major part of my life. I was made to appear simple, style my hair simply and always, forever head the basic route. Bore. But now I'm all grown up and have a sex life to sustain, so the joystick's in my hand and I groom myself to impress. TV Actor, model and part-time charmer—Tushar Khanna too, has lived the just-recited life. He now owns a [blow dryer](https://www.mensxp.com/grooming/hairstyle/43611-7-blow-dryers-for-best-looking-hair-in-2018.html), plugs it in every now and then, achieving dope AF hairstyles that look god sent to us. But what about you? Where's our Grooming School? Lucky for you - here's Mr. Khanna coming clear on exactly 'how you could too'. Let's begin with the basics of a simple blow dry.. 1. Grab that towel and dry your fur. Most often, you'd find yourself blow drying your hair post a shower. So, for starters, towel dry your freshly-washed mane to prepare. 2. Now apply some Moroccan/Argan oil to it. These bottles of shine are available at every neighbourhood store and online. So, before you begin blow drying your hair to achieve that do, scrape your strands with Moroccan or Argan oil. Besides protecting your hair from the heat of the dryer, they'd also give you a natural shine. However, if nothing, a heat resistant spray will always come in handy. 3. Now use a flat/bristle brush, not your old school comb. That teethed creature you've been dragging since ages, won't take you anywhere in life. While it does come into play while taming pesky strands, the perfect blow dried mane is achieved with a flat or bristle brush. 4. Now begin blow drying, one area at a time Here comes the real deal. Its now time to blast your mop with a blow dryer. But remember, take one area at a time—it's the only way of achieving absolute success. Besides, you'd also ensure your 'mop' doesn't actually end up looking like a mop. Woop! With the basics in hand now, here's how to achieve 3 kickass hairstyles you'd love. Hair Style Type: Straight out of school, but I'm coming for you. 1. Once you've dried every section of your mane (one at a time), bring your blow dryer to the top of your head. Angle it downwards and begin blasting the heat while using the flat brush in the same direction. 2. Once your strands have flattened out, switch to a natural comb - your fingers. Run them through to add texture to your hair and achieve coif perfection in literally no time. Hair Style Type: Sharp, casual, all muddled into one. 1. Bring your powerful hair dryer to the front and blow dry backwards using a flat brush. Using your fingers, offer some separation to your mane, keeping the spiked area different from the sides. Now, blow straight into the line of hair partition to separate the areas, for good. 2. Next, grab some pomade and, using your fingers, spike the middle section up. Keep the direction of your fingers straight, but with a slight tilt to the right. Voila, you're done! Hair Style Type: Neat and tidy, and formal AF. 1. Firstly, take time to take the decision of parting from the right or left. Left partitions are usually casual, so for formal settings - part from the right. 2. Using a flat brush, neatly separate your hair and begin blow drying into the line of separation. 3. Now, just flatten your hair as much as you can. If you want to maintain volume, blow dry from the opposite direction first (i.e. your left) and then back in the direction of your real-time blow dry (i.e. from the right). 4. Once separated and flattened, use a fingertip amount of matte hair wax to settle things into place.",
