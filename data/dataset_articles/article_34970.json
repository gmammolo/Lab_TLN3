  "text": "Local veteran’s battle with trauma transforms into healing through music COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - A local army veteran is helping other former soldiers heal - years after his combat deployments, including a famous battle from the War in Afghanistan. Now there’s a new song telling that story. Some of the first lyrics are: “Years of heat and battle, 4 deployments deep, took a toll on my life, night terrors in my sleep, I cried out for help, and the Lord heard me.” The just-released song “Warriors Set Free” is about Army combat veteran James Clark and others like him. He co-wrote that tune. The retired 1st Sgt deployed twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan, where he was involved in that war’s second costliest firefight, 300 Taliban fighters assaulting the U.S. soldiers at COP Keating, as portrayed in the movie “The Outpost.” “My ‘come to Jesus’ moment is when I got injured in 2009 at the Battle of Kamdesh,” 1SG (Ret) James Clark said. “When we got attacked, it was overwhelming for us, simultaneous attacks. We lost 8 guys during that fight. It was a day-to-day and a half battle.” It was tough for James Clark to move on from that trauma, but he believes God spared him for a reason. He got connected with the Columbus-based nonprofit Warriors Set Free which guides military and veterans in healing from their past, and faith walks that help in winning life’s battles. “Moving from kicking in doors and doing direct gunfight battles...is now more of a spiritual warfare for me,” he describes. “It’s a testimony of God’s grace and mercy...transformational,” Tim Maggart said about hearing Clark’s military story at an Operation Song retreat. Fellow Army veteran and singer/songwriter Maggart said he then worked with Clark on the lyrics and now performs the song they created, to hopefully help inspire other vets. As he sings about in Warriors Set Free, “The mission’s changed but we’re still on the battlefield.” You can hear the full song [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/71Y7gxRldfsGq0pNfZUwfb?si=930427c932d7472f&nd=1&dlsi=2b48bdaea20f4a68). Clark said, “Tim started singing it and I started tearing up. I still do every time he plays it.” “That anyone who hears it, it will minister to them, but also get the word out (about Warriors Set Free nonprofit), I believe in what these guys are doing,” Maggart said. Clark got involved with that organization first by going through a one-day Freedom Appointment to address problems like his anger and addictions or a “spiritual house cleansing” as he calls it. [Here’s more](https://warriorssetfree.org/georgia/) on the nonprofit chapter based in Columbus. “Just to know they’ve got brothers that will walk that out with them. You don’t have to be alone. You don’t have to be in the bottle,” Clark added. Warriors Set Free - where he’s now the mission outreach coordinator - also has four-day men’s events called “Warriors Battle” where vets can elevate their faith walk. At their latest one, 17 of the 22 men surrendered to the Lord and got baptized. There was also a concert with their newly adopted song with a chorus that repeats “We are his child...we are warriors set free.” Copyright 2024 WTVM. All rights reserved.",
