  "title": "Covered Care Launches 0% APR Financing for Elective Medical Procedures, Revolutionizing Patient Access to Care",
  "text": "Covered Care, a majority owned subsidiary of Westlake Technology Holdings and a leader in accessible credit solutions for healthcare providers, is excited to announce the launch of its new financing offer: a 0% APR for up to 36 months. Through a commitment to enhancing affordability and patient access to care, Covered Care supports healthcare practices by providing the Full Spectrum patient financing solutions, catering to those with super-prime credit to those with FICOs as low as 500s. “Our goal at Covered Care is to break down financial barriers that may restrict patient access to necessary medical treatments,” said Michelle Nguyen, Chief Operating Officer of Covered Care. “With our new 0% APR financing, we can provide access to care to a greater number of patients at competitive rates. Our goal is to enable our healthcare partners to 'Say Yes' to more patients.\" With a generous term of up to 36 months of interest-free payments, this greatly increases patient affordability, making higher priced, premium elective treatments and services more accessible. Unlike other traditional financing offers, Covered Care’s 0% APR is a true interest-free financing solution for up to 36 months with no deferred or promotional financing gimmicks. By equipping healthcare providers with the financing tools they need to scale their business, Covered Care is changing the medical landscape, making it easier for healthcare professionals to focus on their patients with the care they need, rather than their financial worries.
