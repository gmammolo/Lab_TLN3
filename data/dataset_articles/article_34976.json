  "text": "DUBLIN, Ga. (WGXA) — The gift that keeps on giving. One fourth grader at Hillcrest Elementary School celebrated his ninth \"heartaversary\"; the anniversary of his heart transplant surgery that saved his life. \"I'm just grateful I'm still alive,\" said Jaden Carswell. Carswell was born with Double Inlet Left Ventricle (DILV), a rare congenital heart defect that occurs when both the left and right atria of the heart feed into the left ventricle, instead of each atrium feeding into its own ventricle, according to Cleveland Clinic. The procedure cost $4.3 million but with the help of some non-profits like the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) it was made possible. \"It was terrible. I was 17 at the time so hearing that my baby might need a heart transplant was huge,\" said Jessica Russell, Carswell's mother. Carswell was only three years old at the time of the transplant and with the support of his family he has been able to live a full life.He is now an honor roll student at Hillcrest and he enjoys drawing, playing video games and spending time with his siblings. Russell, now an avid advocate for heart health, has made it a tradition to celebrate her son's \"heartaversary\" to remind him how loved he is. She surprised him with a gift and some of his family members as a way to commemorate the special day in front of his classmates on Nov. 6. Carswell said he had one thought when he saw her: \"She came at the perfect time.\" However, the joyous occasion is also a reminder that life can be fragile. Russell recalls the fear surrounding the heart transplant and receiving the call from the hospital telling her that a match had been found for Carswell. She said it was emotional yet exciting. \"It was very, very random. I just cried for maybe 45 minutes straight; it was a big, big moment and my family and everybody came that night, it was a long process though,\" said Russell. She hopes her son one day becomes an advocate for heart health and helps others who may be going through the same challenges. \"Just being an advocate for heart health, that is a big thing for me. I want him to be able to talk to other kids his age who are going through the same thing,\" said Russell.",
