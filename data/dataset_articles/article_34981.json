  "text": "DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - Quad City area students collect enough donations for 787,186 meals as part of the 38th Student Hunger Drive, which ended Thursday night. Sixteen Quad Cities area high schools participated in the food and funds drive, which started in September. Students from competing schools planned, executed and set goals to be named the top fundraisers in their division. Lexie Thomsen, a senior at Orion High School, said her school got a lot of donations from their community, including 1,000 cereal boxes. “It made me feel really happy that, like all the community’s thinking of us and thinking that we donate here and we help everybody in need.” Thomsen said. During the drive, students learn about volunteering and organization as they work with neighborhood elementary and middle schools. Harper Miller, a sophomore at Assumption High School, said she was blown away from the overwhelming response from the community and students. “The support that people gave, and the students were just so motivated to win and to do well, and they brought in so much food,” Miller said. “They went to the store and bought food, and all of our feeder schools also brought in a lot of food.” The rally started at 5:30 p.m. at River Bend Food Bank. Before the rally began, the students deliver the donations to the food bank. In 2023 the Student Hunger Drive brought in 818,468 meals, exceeding 2022’s record of 817,038 meals. The winners were: Division C - 1st place: Rivermont Collegiate - 2nd place: Morning Star Academy Division B - 1st place: Alleman High School - 2nd Orion High School Division A - 1st place: Pleasant Valley High School - 2nd place: Bettendorf High School Pleasant Valley also won the Mission Challenge Award while North Scott High School won Most Improved. Moline High School was the Skit Winner. Copyright 2024 KWQC. All rights reserved.",
