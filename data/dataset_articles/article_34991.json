By Matthew Mittlieder Published: Nov. 7, 2024 at 7:08 PM CST | Updated: 2 hours ago Email This Link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X (formerly Twitter)\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on LinkedIn\nLINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - A new senior living center in north Lincoln has opened up, boasting a more than 93,000 square-foot community on the Salt Creek Watershed.\nLocated just south of Interstate 80’s 27th street exit, the Salt Creek Senior Living community owned by Dial Senior Living in Omaha includes 62 assisted living and 25 memory care units.\nOfficials said having a facility surrounded by the saline wetlands gives residents views of the landscape, all of which are protected by a conservation easement.\nJoe Bohac, the Salt Creek Senior Living advisor, said that with the lack of senior centers in northern Lincoln, this community will serve a whole host of new people.\n“Every day we’re getting older,” he said. “And we’re getting ready to hit the baby boomer generation that’s looking for senior living. So to have another option in the City of Lincoln, we felt there was a huge need for that.”\nOther features of the facility include a dog park, theater, hair salon, wine bar and a fitness center.\nThe project has been in development since 2017 when planning first began, and opened in October.\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox.\nCopyright 2024 KOLN.
