  "text": "United Way expands 211 helpline for military\nThey're partnering with the Offutt Air Force Base and the Nebraska Department of Veterans' Affairs to offer confidential care tailored to those who are serving in our military and our veterans.\nThey're partnering with the Offutt Air Force Base and the Nebraska Department of Veterans' Affairs to offer confidential care tailored to those who are serving in our military and our veterans.\nThey're partnering with the Offutt Air Force Base and the Nebraska Department of Veterans' Affairs to offer confidential care tailored to those who are serving in our military and our veterans.\nFor nearly 25 years, United Way of the Midlands' 211 Hotline has helped families in our area get connected to social services and assistance.\nRecently, they've been getting more calls from veterans and active-duty service members.\nSo, they decided to do something to provide even more care for that community.\nThey're partnering with the Offutt Air Force Base and the Nebraska Department of Veterans' Affairs to offer confidential care tailored to those who are serving in our military and our veterans.\nThe program, called the Military and Family Helpline, is an extension of the 211 Helpline.\nIt's fueled by funds initially set aside for Offutt's mission to house the nation's space command headquarters.\n\"It didn't make that purpose, but hey, let's use that money. Let's use the community connections. Let's use all that goodwill that came together to try to get Space Command here and offered to continue to support our military families,\" said John Hilgert, the director of the Nebraska Department of Veteran's Affairs.\n211 calls from military members and their families are directed to United Way's navigator, Samantha Kuns, who is a veteran herself.\n\"I've seen it firsthand how well it can work. And just like having Offutt there as well, there's a need out there for these resources,\" Kuns said. \"So, it's a huge thing to be able to connect through offer and through the community side of it as well.\"\nCallers are given 24/7, free, confidential help, connecting them with resources in their community.\n\"It can be anything from mental health to finding food resources to finding tax help. You know, the broad range of anything that a family may need. We have resources available for them,\" said Shawna Forsberg, president and CEO of United Way of the Midlands.\nThe organizations hope this program will help our military community feel safe, comfortable, and supported as they undergo transitions in their lives.",
