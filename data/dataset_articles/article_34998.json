  "text": "A ballot measure that will transform veterinary care in Colorado has been approved by Colorado voters in the 2024 general election.\nProposition 129 was placed on the ballot by citizen initiative. Supporters said it will alleviated a shortage of veterinarians but opponents said it would be dangerous for pets.\nProposition 129 creates a new profession that has not existed before anywhere in the nation, CBS News Colorado Political Reporter Shaun Boyd reported. It is called a veterinary professional associate. Supporters say a VPA is similar to a physician assistant in medicine for humans. There are some big differences, however, as Boyd reported to become a PA you need:\n- At least three years of graduate school\n- 2,000 hours of hands-on clinical practice\nBased on a proposal by Colorado State University, to be a VPA you would have needed:\n- Three semesters of online classes\n- Two semesters of clinical work\nThe other big difference, Boyd reported, was that PAs cannot perform surgery. A VPA will be able to. And a VPA will be able to do almost everything a veterinarian does, minus prescribing medicine. To do that it would take an act of Congress. (Federal law allows only licensed veterinarians to write prescriptions.)\nSupporters argued VPAs can written standard prescriptions for common ailments, but Boyd reports that doesn't address the unintended issues that might arise during surgery and require medication.\nWhile the ballot measure says VPAs will work under the supervision of a veterinarian, it doesn't say whether it will be in-person supervision.\nMore than a dozen veterinary boards and organizations came out against Proposition 129. The Dumb Friends League and several animal welfare organizations pushed for it.\nIn response to the concern about a veterinarian shortage, Boyd offers these facts for consideration:\n1. Veterinary schools are expected to graduate 20% more veterinarians in the next five years. That's how long it would have likely taken to get one class of 25 students trained as VPAs.\n2. Two new Colorado laws go into effect in January that would expand telehealth visits (HB 24-1048) and expand the scope of practice for veterinary technicians (HB 24-1047). Veterinary technicians are similar to VPAs.\nThe need for veterinarians is greatest with farm animals. VPAs wouldn't have been able to work with farm animals, according to the proposition.\nSurveys show that the biggest obstacle to veterinary care isn't access, it's cost. Boyd reports that there is no reliable independent data to back up that Proposition 129 will lower costs.\nMore from CBS News Prop 129 will determine whether \"veterinary professional associate\" becomes a profession Colorado voters approve criminal justice measure Proposition 128 Voters approve for law enforcement funding measure See what supporters and opponents say about Amendment 80 Prop 131 is aimed at giving voters more choices in candidates Jesse Sarles Jesse Sarles manages the web content and website operations for CBS Colorado.
