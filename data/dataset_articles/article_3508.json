  "text": "TIRUPATI: The overall crime rate in the newly formed Annamayya district has come down by 23% in 2023 in comparison to the last year's crime rate.According to Annamayya district SP B Krishna Rao, the total number of cases registered in 2023 was 4920 as against the 6097 cases registered in 2022.The significant decrease in the overall crime rate can be attributed to advance collection of intelligence coupled with preventive and proactive policing. The new district has also seen a reduction in the crimes against women by 31.8%.While the property and bodily offences saw a decline, the district police wing maintained a strong vigil on traffic violations under the MV Act. About 89894 challans were issued and fine amounts totalling Rs.1.74 crore were collected from traffic violators.There was also a decline of 19.5% witnessed in the POCSO cases this year with only 37 cases booked this year against 46 cases registered last year.The district police wing invoked the PD Act against four seasoned offenders and invoked the Externment Act against five others this year.The conviction rate also considerably increased with about 1,680 cases convicted this year as against 1,161 cases last year.",
