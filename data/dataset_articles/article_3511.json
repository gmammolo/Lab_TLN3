This award is going to boost morale of every one posted at this police station,” he said. Director general of police (DGO) RR Swain complimented the officers of Srinagar and the SHO for the achievement. “This recognition underscores the importance of continuously improving police services to support the community and building a positive image. It is a testament to the collective efforts of every individual associated with the Shergadi police station. It reflects the relentless commitment of upholding the highest standards of police services,” Swain said. He expressed gratitude to the MHA for acknowledging the exemplary performance of the station. The award will be handed over in the first week of January, 2024 by home minister Amit Shah at the DGP’s conference.

There are more than 17,000 police stations in the country, out of which 74 from all states and Union Territories were shortlisted.
