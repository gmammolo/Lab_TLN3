  "text": "FactFinder 12: Tips for a fraud-free New Year WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - All year long, FactFinder 12 has warned you about dozens -- and maybe even hundreds -- of same. As it turns out, online-purchase scams are putting you most at risk. The Better Business Bureau broke down what you can do to add to your New Year’s resolutions and have a fraud-free 2024. When shopping online, you always want to make sure you research the retailer before entering payment information. Do they have a working customer service number? Where is the company located? Will you make payments through a secure server? If all of these questions check out, you should also see if there have been any complaints of fraud from other people who have shopped on the website. Aside from online shopping sites, Facebook Marketplace is becoming a scammer favorite. That’s because they can get people to send them money on payment apps with little traceability, like Zelle or Cash App. Luckily, this scam is easy to avoid. If you haven’t met a seller or buyer face to face, don’t send them the money, no matter what they say is its purpose. Additionally, you should be wary of unsolicited emails from a person or company. Remember, scammers can make emails look like they’re from a legitimate business, government agency or reputable organization. Never click on links or open attachments in unsolicited emails.
