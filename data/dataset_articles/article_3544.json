  "text": "Ever wondered what it takes to become an award-winning brewery? Reporter Brodie Stone went behind the scenes at McLeod’s Brewery in Waipū to find out.\nTucked away in the picturesque coastal settlement of Waipū sits McLeod’s Brewery , a small-town name that in the past nine years has become one sitting atop coasters from Cape to Bluff.\nBut making it big time is at the hands of a small 10-strong crew who have mastered the alchemy of beer, and it’s the sense of place that McLeod’s Brewery is based on that may just be the secret to its success.\nThe name itself comes from the location — McLeod’s settlement block is right where the lager is brewed, batched and sent off.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. “ Waipū is a classic New Zealand immigrant story, people throwing it all in to go to the other side of the world and start a community — in this case the Scots from the highlands. So that [was] the whole sentiment of starting our brewery,” co-owner Geoff Gwynne said.\nIt’s easy to identify McLeod’s as a Northland brewery from its distinctive art by Aria award-winning and Grammy-nominated artist Sarah Larnach. Pictures of Northland’s idyllic coastlines adorn the cans in a style that reminds one of 50s nostalgia.",
