Additionally, recovery of stolen property has shown improvement, reaching 72 per cent this year, up from 66 per cent in 2022.\nThe SP said district police's vigilance against smuggling of red sanders proved effective, resulting in arrest of 76 smugglers in connection with 15 cases. Over the course of the year, 34 vehicles and 975 red sanders logs worth 9.75 crore have been seized.\nHe underlined that police have successfully cracked down on ganja smuggling. 416 individuals have been apprehended for their involvement in 105 ganja cases.
