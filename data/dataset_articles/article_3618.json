It's all thanks to the nonprofit Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. , which provided a charitable donation to the department.\nThe nonprofit was established in 2019 and aims to provide dogs of law enforcement and related agencies with bullet and stab protective vests and other assistance. The body armor is made in the United States, is custom fitted to each K9, and is certified by the National Institute of Justice.\nThe nonprofit said a $985 donation sponsors one vest , and each vest has a value of $1,800.
