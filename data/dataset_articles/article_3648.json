  "text": "CARBONDALE, Ill. -- Police in Carbondale caught a thief taking items from a home thanks to a notification from the Ring Neighbors app.\nThe Carbondale Police Department said it happened on December 28 in the area of Washington and Hester Streets. Police said they were alerted about a package theft by the Ring Neighbors app.\nPolice officers and detectives were able to get the photos from the incident and later found a suspect wearing the same clothing.\nThey also recovered the stolen items and were returned back to the victim.\n“The Neighbors app has proven to be a very effective tool in bringing neighbors together by sharing information and creating a sense of community, as well as increasing the chances for a successful criminal investigation when the need arises,” Carbondale police stated in a news release. “Subscribers to the Neighbors app are not required to notify or communicate with police, and police do not have access to anyone’s cameras or knowledge of the address or owner information unless it is provided by the owner. Cooperation with law enforcement is strictly voluntary.
