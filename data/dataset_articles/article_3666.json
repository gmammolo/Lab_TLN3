  "text": "WASHINGTON D.C. – A French Bulldog named Mocha, who was recently the subject of a theft incident, has been found. The owner reported Mocha’s safe return, stating that the dog was located on Alabama Avenue. This development follows a distressing event that occurred last Friday. The incident unfolded when the owner listed Mocha for sale online. A suspect, purportedly interested in purchasing the dog, arranged to meet on the 3300 block of 14th Place, Southeast. However, upon arrival with Mocha, the owner was confronted by individuals who forcibly took the dog. A threatening situation ensued, with one of the suspects displaying a handgun and intimidating the owner. Mocha, a 1-year-old female French Bulldog of beige color, notable for a microchip and a recent C-section scar, became the center of a police investigation following the incident. While details about the suspects remain undisclosed, the recovery of Mocha is a relief to the owner and the community. The Washington D.C. Metro Police continue to investigate the theft. They encourage anyone with information regarding the incident or the suspects to contact them at (202) 727-9099 or to send a tip via text to the Department’s Text Tip Line at 50411, referencing case 23207326.",
