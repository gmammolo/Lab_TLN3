  "text": "COCONUT CREEK, FL – Coconut Creek police are trying to reduce homelessness along Coconut Creek Parkway. Coconut Creek Police Chief Albert \"Butch\" Arenal told city commissioners earlier this month that a church on the parkway is drawing homeless people because it is giving away food. He didn’t name the church in his remarks, and added the “loitering” is in the area of Wynmoor and South Creek. “We are concerned about loitering along the parkway,” he said. In response, Arenal said his officers are stepping up efforts to meet with homeless people and offer them help with getting into shelters and qualifying for social services. “Our officers are doing everything they can to facilitate solutions,” he said. “They are constantly meeting their needs.” It’s not clear how many homeless people are living in Coconut Creek, but their presence has been noted at recent government meetings and police incidents, including the discovery of a body of a homeless man next to Home Depot on Wiles Road last month. Read more here. Commissioner Jackie Railey said she’s been told that police reached out to seven homeless people and only two wanted assistance to get off the streets. “That won’t stop us from trying,” she said at the commission meeting, “because even if we help one person, it’s worth it.” She praised police for helping to get a bus ticket for a homeless woman in the city to reunite her with family in North Carolina. In addition to officers reaching out directly to the homeless, social service workers are also doing more to help. Mayor Josh Rydell added that nonprofit workers recently reached out to help the homeless living in the woods in the area of Lyons Road and Atlantic Boulevard where a new light industrial park is going to be built soon. Besides the church offering food, Arenal said he has another reason why the homeless are gathering along Coconut Creek Parkway. “It’s safe,” he said, “I take that as a compliment, but it is causing some problems with some of our businesses and our property owners in the area.” MORE COCONUT CREEK NEWS BUSINESS & FINANCE: Top Five News Stories in TAPinto Coconut Creek in 2023 EDUCATION: Lyons Creek Middle School in Coconut Creek Drops to B Rated School FOOD & DRINK: Soup’s On: Best Bowls in Coconut Creek and Coral Springs for Warming Up POLICE & FIRE: Mail Theft Is Surging Across Nation, including in Coconut Creek BUSINESS & FINANCE: Karen Matroni Stepping Down as General Manager of Promenade at Coconut Creek After Six Years Sign up to get local news from TAPinto in your inbox for FREE!",
