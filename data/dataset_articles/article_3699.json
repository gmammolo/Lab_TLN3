  "text": "The Boulder Police and Fire Communications Center’s training program has been certified by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials, the largest organization for public safety communication professionals, according to Boulder police spokeswoman Dionne Waugh. According to a Boulder news release, the certification ensures that an agency’s curriculum, training materials and supporting documentation are reviewed and checked for compliance. In the release, Dispatch Manager Brad Riggin said Colorado currently doesn’t have any training standards for 911 dispatchers, which was part of the reason the communications center worked for certification. “This certification ensures we are meeting APCO training standards and if the State of Colorado moves towards required training standards for 911 dispatchers, our center will likely already meet or exceed them,” Riggin said in the release. The certification status required Dispatch Supervisor Courtney Simmer to ensure the center’s training program met almost 200 required standards. The center will be required to re-certify every three years. “This validation serves as an expression of what we’ve known for a long time,” Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in the release.",
