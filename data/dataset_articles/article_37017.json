The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 30°C and 20°C respectively throughout the week.In addition to Bengaluru, several other districts have also been issued yellow alerts. These include Kodagu, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Chitradurga, Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi, Vijayapura, Kolar and Chikkaballapur.

Authorities have declared a holiday for schools and anganwadis in Ullal and Bantwal taluks as a precautionary measure.\"With the volume of rainfall expected in the next few days, we are taking preventive steps to avoid any safety hazards, especially for children and commuters,\" local officials said.\nWatch Out for Landslides, Avoid Unnecessary Travel: IMD Warns\nThe IMD has also flagged risks of landslides in the hilly regions of Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru due to persistent rain. Travellers heading to these districts have been advised to avoid long journeys and exercise caution. \"Stay indoors unless absolutely necessary.
