  "text": "Staff reporter\nGuwahati: Despite significant investments in promoting girls’ education, over 1,200 seats remain vacant in Assam’s Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs).\nAccording to official data, the State currently has 151 functional KGBVs with a total intake capacity of 17,245 students. However, 1,262 of these seats are lying unoccupied. A central level meeting was held recently and reviewed the progression of projects implemented under Samagra Shiksha Assam (SSA). The meeting concerned over the underutilization of these residential schools meant for girls from disadvantaged backgrounds. The meeting advised the SSA to conduct an in-depth analysis to identify the reasons behind the vacancies. The goal is to ensure full enrolment and improve access and retention of girl students, particularly from rural and marginalized communities.\nOfficials have been asked to provide detailed data and propose strategies to fill the vacant positions, ensuring that the intended beneficiaries can fully avail the educational and residential support offered by the KGBVs.\nAlso Read: Digital learning tablets distributed among students of KGBV, Dhubri\nAlso Watch:",
