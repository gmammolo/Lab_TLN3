  "text": "July 1, 1931 — July 14, 2025\nOur beloved mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and aunt, has returned to her Heavenly parents. Elva JoAnn Allphin Gifford passed away peacefully in her sleep at her home on July 14, 2025.\nMom was born in Malad, Idaho, on July 1, 1931, to James H. and Elva Price Williams. She was the baby of the family of two sisters and three brothers. She grew up on the family ranch in Gwenford, driving the hay tractor, and riding her horse. She was her dad’s “Pet,” as he called her. She was a rodeo queen and excelled at barrel racing.\nAfter graduating from Malad High School, she visited her sister in Lovell, Wyoming, where she met Reuben Gene Allphin, her eternal sweetheart. Two months later they were married in the Idaho Falls Temple on Aug. 12, 1949. In a letter JoAnn’s mother wrote to Gene, she said, “You know she is a spoiled baby, so you will have to be patient with her and I am sure she will make you a good wife. We love her very much and hope you will always love and cherish her.” JoAnn and Gene did love and cherish each other.\nThey lived in Lovell, Wyoming; Bozeman, Montana; Brigham City and Ogden, Utah, before they settled in Washington Terrace, Utah, where they raised their family of six children. Because of Gene’s poor health, they moved to Southern Utah in 1978. They built a home in Santa Clara where JoAnn has lived for the last 46 years. Gene passed away in September 1985 at age 58.\nJoAnn married Leon Gifford in November 1986. He was a wonderful husband to JoAnn, and a beloved 2nd father and grandfather to all the family.\nAs a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, JoAnn held many callings, but the one she cherished the most was serving with Leon for 13 years in the St. George Temple. They also served two missions: one in the Laie Hawaii Temple, and later served in the Japan Fukuoka Mission Office.\nJoAnn was preceded in death by her parents, siblings, and husbands, Gene and Leon. One great-granddaughter, Nova Judkins, also passed away as an infant.\nMom leaves behind a large posterity from her children: Michael Gene (Jolene) Allphin; Mark W. (Shauna) Allphin; Janet (Don) Judkins; Shanna (Jim) Dunyon; Sandy (Rick) Nelson; and Lisa (Tom) Gubler. Mom’s legacy through these children have given her 33 grandchildren, 121 great-grandchildren, and 30 great-great grandchildren.\nA viewing and visitation for friends and family will be held at the McArthur Funeral Home, 160 W. 700 South, St. George, Utah, on Saturday, July 19, 2025, from 5-7 p.m.\nA funeral will be held in Washington Terrace, Ogden, Utah, on Monday, July 21, 2025, at 11 a.m., preceded by a viewing from 9-10:30 a.m. at the church meetinghouse located at 25 E. 5350 South, Washington Terrace, Utah.\nInterment will directly follow the funeral at Washington Heights Memorial Park, 4500 Washington Blvd., Ogden, Utah.\nThe family is grateful for the many personnel at Enhabit Home Health who have been such amazing caregivers as well as friends of our mother. Jake from Lincare also became a special friend as he visited every week. We are extremely grateful for Ana Velia Poston who has been her special companion and live-in caregiver for the last five years.\nWe’d like to thank McArthur Funeral Home for the tender care and personal attention given to our mother and family.\nArrangements are under the direction of McArthur Funeral Home and Cremation Center, 160 West 700 South, St. George, 435-652-2844. Family and friends are invited to sign JoAnn's online guest book.",
