  "text": "Our maritime provinces remain trapped in a cycle of rural neglect, says Member of Parliament Lynda Tabuya.\nSpeaking in Parliament yesterday, she said her recent trip to Lau for the installation of the Tui Lau, Tui Nayau, and Sau ni Vanua ko Lau brought her face-to-face with the challenges.\n“Having just returned from my first visit to Lakeba, and my second visit to Vanuabalavu, I deeply reflected on the state of development,” Ms Tabuya said.\n“As a daughter of Kadavu, another maritime province, the parallels in our challenges struck me deeply.\n“What I witnessed in Lau reflects a broader truth. Our maritime provinces remain trapped in a cycle of rural neglect.”\nShe said despite the vast potential that maritime islands had, they still lack the basic infrastructure that defined modern development.\n“But this is not just a Lau story. It’s a story of every maritime province in Fiji.\n“The lack of equitable investment has left our coastal communities vulnerable and disconnected.”\nMs Tabuya acknowledged efforts by the government, such as the fortification of the Tubou seawall and solar power installations.\nHowever, she said this was not enough.",
