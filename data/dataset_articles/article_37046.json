  "text": "The wife of an allegedly murdered Queensland man has shared her heartbreak in a touching online tribute.\nZdravko Bilic, 57, was found stabbed to death in the front yard of his Napalle St home in Warana on the Sunshine Coast.\nBilic was found just after 7.30pm on Monday with two stab wounds to his abdomen, police said.\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\nHis wife, Gry Tomte, runs a popular skincare clinic in Melbourne’s St Kilda and was interstate at the time.\nShe had contacted a neighbour to check in on Bilic when he couldn’t be reached.\n“There is no way I can capture the immense grief I feel over losing the most beautiful man,” Tomte said.\n“My world for 28 years.”\nTomte said Bilic was “so much more than the beauty mogul’s husband”.\n“He was my everything.”\nA tribute site was set up for friends and family on Thursday, with more than 100 posts added within three hours of its creation.\n“The circumstances surrounding his death make it even more heartbreaking,” one post read.\n“I can’t even begin to imagine the pain you’re carrying right now,” said another.\n“Please know I’m holding you close in my thoughts and sending you all my love and an abundance of strength to help you through these impossible days.”\nIn a statement released by police on her behalf, Tomte said the void Bilic leaves behind is “unbearable”.\n“From the moment we met, both of us living away from family in the new country we had fallen in love with, we knew instantly we were each other’s person.\n“We were complete opposites, and together we made a whole.\n“People say I’m the strong one but I could only be strong because he allowed me to be, and because he wrapped his arms around me daily to make sure I could.”\nBilic was an avid soccer fan and supporter of Melbourne Victory, and youth coach at Ginger Sports, Tomte said.\n“He was loved by more people than I can put into words,” she said.\n“He will be missed by the children, who are constantly asking for him and looking forward to seeing him.\n“If you’ve had the privilege of being in Zed’s presence, you’ll know that he was literal sunshine.\n“And the world is a little less bright without him in it.”\nA 15-year-old boy from West Woombye and a 17-year-old boy from Beerwah have been charged with murder after what police described as a disturbance at the home.\nThey are due to appear at Maroochydore Children’s Court on Thursday.\nThe investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information or security vision from the area between 11pm on July 13 and 7.35pm on July 14 is urged to contact police.\nStream free on",
