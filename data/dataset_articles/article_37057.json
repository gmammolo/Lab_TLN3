  "text": "Heat waves affect everyone, especially first responders\nGRAYSON COUNTY, Texas (KXII) - There is a summer heat wave coming and it will affect everyone in different ways but when first responders are carrying lots of gear, it can be dangerous.\nGrayson County Deputies are no stranger to the Texas heat.\nAccording to Lieutenant Jeremy Cox of Grayson County the most important thing to escaping heat exhaustion is staying hydrated.\n“They all take really good steps to make sure that they have fluids on board their vehicles,” Lieutenant Cox said.\nBut the gear that they have to wear every time they go out “adds about 30 pounds to an individual”.\nSometimes that weight and the dark colored uniforms poses a challenge to the Deputies on call.\n“We have had deputies unfortunately succumb to the heat before and our supervisors are usually pretty keen and aware of how to deal with that,” Cox said.\nTo prevent this from happening the supervisors will rotate the Deputies in and out to give them breaks from the sun and extreme heat.\n“It’s so they aren’t just sitting out there for hours and hours becoming exhausted and don’t become a heat casualty,” Cox said.\nRegardless of the temperature The Grayson County Sheriff’s Office wants everyone to know they are here to help.\n“24 hours a day 7 days a week we are here,” Cox said.\nCopyright 2025 KXII.
