  "text": "A MAN who led police on two pursuits, ripped through road spikes and crashed into the bush at Wallsend before running and impaling his leg on a fence has been jailed for a maximum of 16 months.\nJustin Glen Bradley, 26, appeared in Newcastle Local Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to two counts of police pursuit, driving while disqualified and low-range drink driving.\nPolice said they were patrolling Metcalfe Street at Wallsend about 11.40pm on May 23 when they attempted to stop the driver of a white Kia Rio.\nBut when Bradley refused to pull over, police launched a pursuit that was quickly terminated after officers lost sight of the vehicle.\nA short time later, highway patrol officers began pursuing the vehicle again and road spikes were successfully deployed at Wallsend before police lost sight of the car again.\nIt was just after midnight that police found the Kia Rio abandoned after it had crashed into bushland at the end of Elermore Parade, Wallsend.\nPolice set up a perimeter and called in the NSW Police Dog Unit and the police helicopter to help with the search.\nBradley was found in nearby Cambronne Parade and took off on foot, police giving chase before arresting the 26-year-old as he tried to jump a timber paling fence.\nPolice said Bradley was attempting to scale the fence when he slipped and impaled his right calf on the top of the fence.\nPolice say the immediately started first aid until paramedics arrived to treat Bradley and Fire and Rescue NSW were called to cut him down from the fence.\nHe was taken to John Hunter Hospital under police guard for treatment to his wound and after being discharged was taken to Waratah police station where he was charged.\nBradley was refused bail and pleaded guilty to all the charges in June.\nOn Thursday, he was jailed for a maximum of 16 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months, making him eligible for release in May, 2026.",
