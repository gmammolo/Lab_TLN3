Memorials may be left at the funeral home or the church for a later designation.\nFuneral arrangements are under the guidance of Sharp Funeral Home in Carroll, and online condolences may be left for Julie’s family at www.sharpfuneral.com.\nJulie Rae (Drommer) Waterman was born July 15, 1948, the youngest child of William “Bill” and Dorothea Drommer. Julie grew up in Sioux City, Iowa, and graduated from Central High School in 1967.\nJulie attended Morningside College in Sioux City but suspended her pursuit of her degree when she married and had children. Julie married the love of her life, Paul Waterman, on Dec. 6,1975. Paul and Julie spent 49 married years together. In 1977, Paul and Julie welcomed their youngest child into the family and moved to Jefferson.\nJulie became a Boy Scout troop leader when her son was of that age. Julie and her husband also became foster parents in the 1980s and still maintain a relationship with their foster kids as adults today.\nJulie continued her educational pursuit at Des Moines Area Community College in Boone and then transferred to Iowa State University in Ames where she obtained her bachelor of arts degree with a double major in 1987. After graduating, Julie worked for Laughlin Enterprises out of Des Moines for a few years before she started her rewarding career with Walmart in Carroll. Julie loved working for Walmart and made many lasting friends while working there.\nAfter Julie’s husband retired, the couple moved to Carroll in 2009. Julie retired from Walmart in 2016, but continued to participate in the cookie exchanges as well as the ladies’ luncheons. Julie enjoyed shopping like no one else. But Julie also enjoyed baking goodies for her family, growing flowers in her yard, volunteering at church, and golfing.\nThe only thing that brought Julie more joy than that was visiting and vacationing with her sisters and her family and friends. Anybody who knew Julie knew how much vacationing in Canada with her extended family every year truly meant to her.\nJulie is survived by her husband Paul Waterman of Carroll; daughter Michelle Spitler of Coon Rapids; son Patrick Jans and fianceé Christine Marrah of Maryland Heights, Missouri; daughter Carrie Scheuermann of Carroll; her grandchildren and great-grandchildren Tina Smith and her sons Riley and Austin of Lytton; Megan and Colton Conn and daughters Olivia and Eleanor of Omaha, Nebraska; Caleb and Alexa Jans and children Myla, Mac, and Micah Joe of Perry; Blake and Natalie Jans of Perry; Madeline and Jay McCord of Perry; and Dominic Scheuermann of Carroll; sister Dodie White of Alabama; brother-in-law Larry Johnson of Indiana; sister-in-law Sylvia Waterman of Lytton; by many other nephews, nieces, cousins, and friends; and her dog Vader Sanders.\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Bill and Dorothy Drommer; son-in-law Christopher Scheuermann; sisters Marilyn Johnson and Patricia (Darrell) Will; brothers-in-law Marvin Waterman and Dr. Robert White; sister-in-law Beverly (Darwin) Paeper; nephew Larry Paeper; and great-nephew Alex Reinhardt.",
