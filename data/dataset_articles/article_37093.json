  "text": "The Great Le Sueur Treasure Hunt is on. Three medallions have been hidden across the city of Le Sueur. The expert-level medallion has already been found, but the intermediate and beginner level medallions remain undiscovered. Kim, August, Sarah and Lydia found the expert medallion after just one clue was released. Based on the clue \"Find the edge,\" the family discovered the medallion near the welcome sign at the south end of town. Until the remaining two medallions are found, each week, Le Sueur County News and the Henderson Independent will be publishing and broadcasting clues to help steer treasure hunters in the right direction. Le Sueur County News will be posting clues to our Facebook page every Monday as a new clue for the intermediate-level medallion drops. Clue No. 2 Two seals will show you the way. Clue No. 1 Grease is #1.",
