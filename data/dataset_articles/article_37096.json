  "text": "Gladly, Memphis is okay! Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany, recently shared on Instagram that they had to spend the night in the ER with their son, Memphis.\n“The Big Green Tractor” singer has four kids: two daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, with his ex-wife, and a son and a daughter, Memphis and Navy, with his wife, Brittany.\nMemphis was born on December 1, 2017, and is currently seven years old. A few days ago, he gave his parents quite a scare when he broke his collarbone and had to stay in the hospital overnight.\nBrittany Aldean Shared What Happened In A Lighthearted Instagram Story Brittany posted a video on her story showing her kneeling next to her son, Memphis, on the hospital bed.\nIn the video, you can hear the family talking and discussing the ordeal.\nJason asks him if he is feeling better, to which he responds, “Kind of.” The singer then tries to explain what might happen to his son, saying,\n“I hope it’s not broke, but I think maybe you’re probably gonna have to get a little sling. I bet they’ll give you a little sling.”\nBrittany wrote over the screen, “Still making us laugh even in the ER,” clearly trying to bring some humor to the intense situation.\nOff camera, you can hear what is probably Jason Aldean’s dad telling Memphis that he should tell his friends that he got the injury fighting off multiple assailants.\nWhich Memphis takes seriously, saying there’s no way he could beat anyone up in his current state. Everyone in the room disagrees, clearly trying to improve his mood, saying he could or is “strong.”\nMemphis hilariously responds, “With this arm? Absolutely not!\nThis makes his parents laugh.\nMemphis in the hospital. (brittanyaldean / Instagram) RELATED: Jason Aldean Shares His Thoughts On Post Malone Going Country\nGladly, he is doing well.\nAfter the video, Brittany shared a photo explaining what happened to their son. She shared that Memphis broke his collarbone but will be “healed” soon.\nThe family did not disclose how he got his injury and has not posted a more recent update.\nBrittany’s story update. (brittanyaldean / Instagram) Return here for any future updates, and get better soon, Memphis!",
