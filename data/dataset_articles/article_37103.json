  "text": "PITTSFIELD, Mass. ( NEWS10 ) — The stepdaughter of Berkshire County District Attorney Timothy Shugrue has been identified as the victim of an alleged murder in Colorado, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation . 32-year-old Jordan Elizabeth LaBarre was reportedly found dead on July 7. “I can’t put into words what she means to me and everybody else, but she’s very independent. And I wish I was more like her in that way,” said Joshua Labarre, Jordan Elizabeth Labarre’s brother. LaBarre said he and his sister grew up very close, relying on each other. “We grew up, I mean, from cribs. When we first moved up here [Pittsfield], we didn’t know anybody. So, we were together, we both didn’t know anybody.” And even though he was the big brother, Joshua said his siter, “always was sticking up for me or you know. Or my mom or, you know, my stepsister. And she was just fierce.” Joshua said his sister did her own thing in life and that she moved out west right after she graduated college. “About 10 years ago, she had a lot of friends in Colorado, and she wanted to, you know, Colorado is very much her. Like it’s snowboarding, it’s outdoors. it’s very free living.” Joshua said his sister was just simply strong willed. “It’s funny because I started snowboarding first, but, you know, and I’m still you know, I thought I was good, but I mean, I didn’t I’m not still snowboarding to this day, so. Um, but she is good. I mean, she. She stuck with it” He said his sister Jordan balanced tenacity with a sense of humor, “She’s one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. And people will probably say I’m, you know, I’m funny, but she’s funny. She’s very funny.” He went to explain his sister loved concerts and going out with her friends. “There’s a bunch of pictures of her and her friends at the at Red Rock and a bunch of concerts and festivals.” Her dog Lincoln was her life, and he stayed by her side through thick and thin. Lincoln now lives with Jordan’s brother. “It feels good to have him here. It’s like a mix of emotions. Seeing him makes me really sad, but at the same time, he’s a part of her. He meant so much to her. So, I want to do what I can, whatever I can to make sure he’s good.” The family has a GoFundMe set up to cover funeral expenses.
