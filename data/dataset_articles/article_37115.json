  "text": "Nuke Deterrence \"Cannot Save Humanity\": Hidankyo Member\nNewsfrom Japan\nWorld\n- English\n- 日本語\n- 简体字\n- 繁體字\n- Français\n- Español\n- العربية\n- Русский\nWashington, July 16 (Jiji Press)--Nuclear deterrence \"cannot save humanity,\" a senior member of a group of hibakusha atomic bomb survivors in Japan, said in a video speech at a meeting of scientists in Chicago on Wednesday.\nIn the speech delivered in English, Masako Wada, assistant secretary-general of the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, or Nihon Hidankyo, urged policymakers around the world to \"take the leadership...toward human society free of nuclear weapons.\"\nWada stressed that members of Nihon Hidankyo, which won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize, will work to arouse public opinion by talking to young people and sharing their own experiences.\nShe criticized the emerging idea of nuclear sharing, in which U.S. nuclear weapons would be deployed in Japan, saying that Japan, which claims to be the only country to have been attacked with atomic bombs, may \"become an aggressor.\"\nProfessor David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, said that Wada's speech was very moving and made him realize that what he and other scientists are discussing is a matter of human life.\n[Copyright The Jiji Press, Ltd.]",
