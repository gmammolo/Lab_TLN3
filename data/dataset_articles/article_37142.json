  "text": "DALLAS CENTER, Iowa — An animal rescue nonprofit has started a memorial fund and will name a shelter in honor of one of its youngest supporters, Eloise Peck of Dallas, who died in the devastating floods in Central Texas over the July 4 holiday.\nPeck had started a dog walking service over the summer, with 25% of her earned proceeds going to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue, a nonprofit animal rescue service in Arkansas.\n\"Eloise (LuLu) Peck was a bright, joyful spirit who brought warmth and laughter into every life she touched,\" the nonprofit said in a post on its website. \"At just eight years old, her profound love and compassion for animals shone brightly, reflecting the purity and kindness of her heart. She started a dog walking service this summer with 25% of her earned proceeds going to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue. In honor of Lulu's beautiful life and the extraordinary love she held for animals, Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue has established this memorial fund. Your generous donation will continue Lulu's legacy by helping to provide care, love, and support to animals in need.\"\nFor more information about the memorial fund and to donate, click here.\nBlueberry Hill Farm and Rescue says a newly constructed shelter there will also be named Lulu’s Puppy Hut in honor of Peck.\n\"Together, we will keep Lulu's memory alive, nurturing hope and healing for animals. Lulu’s name will forever live on at BHFAR with a newly constructed shelter officially being named Lulu’s Puppy Hut. This shelter will provide much-needed warmth, safety, and a loving place for our foster puppies to stay until we find their forever homes …We will cherish our sweet Lulu, her name, and her love of animals daily here at our rescue farm,\" their website reads.\nBlueberry Hill Farm and Rescue had just shared a post on social media about Peck's support of the nonprofit on June 18.\n\"Our favorite little Blueberry Ambassador Lulu Rogers Peck is pounding the pavement, literally!\" Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue said at the time. \"She started a dog walking service this summer and has amazingly offered to share 25% of the proceeds to Blueberry Hill Farm and Rescue. Dallas is the home to some of the MOST generous and giving people I am honored to know.\"\nPeck was among a growing number of victims killed in catastrophic flooding in Central Texas. Neighbors in Highland Park are memorializing all of the victims by tying green ribbons to trees.",
