  "text": "BELOIT — Fort Atkinson's 19U American Legion Post 166 baseball team earned a pair of down-to-the-wire victories over host Beloit on Wednesday.\nThe Hawks (7-2-1) scored five runs in the seventh inning to overtake the Bandits, 8-7, before scoring three runs in the seventh en route to winning the finale, 12-9.\nIn the first game, Beloit's Brenin Pearson drove in the go-ahead run with a double in the home half of the sixth.\nFort countered with a five-run rally in the top of the seventh.\nBraiden Wainwright led off the inning by drawing a walk, took second on a passed ball before scoring the tying run after Benett Thompson bunted and reached on catcher Brody Berg's error.\nAfter Brogan Bosch singled, Braeden Hoth drove in the go-ahead run with a fly ball single to center to put the Hawks up 5-4. Gavin Kanters added an RBI single before Alexis Martinez had a run-scoring ground out.\nThe Bandits made things interesting in the bottom of the seventh.\nAfter Berg and Noah Pfundheller each drew two-out walks off Thompson, Brayden Ward produced an RBI double. Willmy Henriquez followed with a two-run single to make it 8-7. Thompson then struck out Sam Erickson swinging to end it.\nMason Ketterhagen started for Fort and allowed three earned runs on seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. Wainwright pitched 2 2/3 innings of two-hit ball to earn the decision before Thompson pitched the seventh.\nKanters finished 2-for-3 with a triple and two RBIs while Martinez also drove home two runs.\nThe Hawks jumped ahead 9-0 through three and a half innings in the second game, only to see the Bandits score three runs apiece in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings to tie it up.\nFort's three-run seventh started when Brady Byrnes drew a four-pitch walk. With one away, Hoth singled and took second on the throw, which allowed Byrnes to come around to score the go-ahead run.\nWith two away, Kanters was intentionally walked and Martinez drew a walk to load the bases. Kohen Brant drove in two insurance runs with a hard-hit ground ball single to center.\nByrnes pitched 1 1/3 no-hit innings in relief to earn the decision. He tossed a 1-2-3 seventh.\nColin Schrader started for Fort and surrendered four earned runs on six hits in four frames. Martinez gave up three earned runs on two hits in 1 2/3 innings.\nThe teams combined for 20 hits, including 12 by the Hawks who tallied five extra-base knocks. Hoth, Kanters, Ketterhagen, Brant and Ketterhagen had two hits each. Kanters scored three runs and doubled twice while Brant notched three RBIs.\nFort produced a five-run rally in the second inning, which Bosch capped by slugging a two-run homer to center on a 2-0 pitch. Byrnes' two-out RBI single in the third pushed the Hawks' advantage to 7-0.\nFort hosts Janesville on Monday at 7:30 p.m.\nFirst game\nFORT 8, BELOIT 7\nFort 201 000 5 -- 8 7 1\nBeloit 002 101 3 -- 7 11 4\nLeading hitters -- FA: Kanters 2x3 (3B), Ketterhagen (2B); B: Berg 3x3 (2 2B), Ward 2x4 (2B), Pearson (2B)\nPitching (ip-h-r-er-bb-so) -- FA: Ketterhagen 3.1-7-3-3-3-2, Wainwright W; 2.2-2-1-1-1-1, Thompson 1-2-3-3-2-1; B: Halon 5.1-3-3-2-4-9, Pfundheller L; 1.2-4-5-2-2-0\nSecond game\nFORT 12, BELOIT 9\nFort 151 200 3 -- 12 12 2\nBeloit 000 333 0 -- 9 8 3\nLeading hitters -- FA: Kanters 2x4 (2 2B), Hoth 2x4 (2B), Martinez 2x4 (3B), Brant 2x4, Ketterhagen 2x3, Bosch (HR); B: Halon 3x4, Henriquez (3B), Piccione 2x3 (3B), Pearson (2B)\nPitching (ip-h-r-er-bb-so) -- FA: Schrader 4-6-6-4-2-3, Martinez 1.2-2-3-3-4-2, Byrnes W; 1.1-0-0-0-0-0; B: West 4-10-9-3-2-0, Erickson L; 3-2-3-3-4-2",
