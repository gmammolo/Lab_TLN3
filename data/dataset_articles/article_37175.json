  "text": "Three brothers whose bond, love and support for each other was unbreakable, saw that connection shattered in an instant on a dark and foggy July 15 morning in Marion Oaks. Alexy Quedevo-Perez, the oldest of the three siblings, was killed in a three-vehicle crash at the intersection of Marion Oaks Boulevard and Marion Oaks Manor. Grieving family and friends gathered just mere yards away from the crash. Florida Highway Patrol troopers on scene comforted the group, who hugged, cried and appeared to be in disbelief that the 28-year-old from Venezuela was no longer with them. \"They lived together, they went everywhere with each other, they were always together,\" said stepfather Charles Fisher, whose wife raised the brothers when their mother died in Venezuela more than 20 years ago. Fisher, whose wife was sitting in a vehicle and being consoled by a woman, was crying uncontrollably. Marion County Fire Rescue spokesperson James Lucas said crews were assigned to the crash at 6:17 a.m. and arrived five minutes later. Quedevo-Perez was pronounced dead at the scene. Local news: Ocala and Marion County rescuers enter second week of Texas flood recovery efforts FHP officials said the brothers were traveling south in a Honda minivan on Marion Oaks Boulevard and had the right-of-way. A Hyundai car headed east on Marion Oaks Manor was stopped at the stop sign. According to troopers, a white catering van being driven west on Marion Oaks Manor by a 40-year-old Reddick man ran the stop sign and crashed into the left side of the brothers' van. The crash caused both vehicles to rotate before the brothers' van hit the Hyundai. A 41-year-old woman behind the wheel of the Hyundai was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries, troopers said. Alexander and Alejandro Quedevo-Perez, the surviving two brothers, also were injured and taken to a local hospital for treatment. Family and friends said Alexander Quedevo-Perez, 25, injured his hip while his brother, Alejandro, 25, suffered a minor injury. The driver of the catering van told a Star-Banner reporter that he was on his way to work. He said he stopped at the stop sign and thinks the minivan was traveling in the wrong direction. He said he does not remember anything else. The man said blood was taken from him for testing. Troopers said that is done to check if he was impaired at the time of the crash. \"I feel terrible. It's sad,\" the driver of the catering van said about the victim. Fisher said the brothers worked at Energy Air in Orlando. He said the surviving brothers called and told the family they were involved in a crash. Alexy Quedevo-Perez leaves behind a wife and two children, a boy and a girl. Records show the fatality was the 36th for the year in Marion County. The figure does not include deaths from the cities of Ocala, Belleview or Dunnellon. The number is down from the 2024 total around this time. By July 22, 2024, the number was 43. In 2024, troopers recorded 100 fatalities. Contact Austin L.
