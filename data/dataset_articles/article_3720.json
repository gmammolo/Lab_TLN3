  "text": "[](/philly-police-searching-info-hit-and-run-incidents/) [](https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-jersey-department-transportation-state-police-stephen-napoli-0599996/) December 29, 2023 The number of homicides in Philadelphia fell more than 20% this year compared to 2022, following a nationwide trend of decreasing violent crime numbers. FBI data shows that large U.S. cities have experienced sharp decreases in killings and gun violence. The New York Times reported on the statistics Friday, highlighting Philadelphia as an example. According to the [Philadelphia Police Department](https://www.phillypolice.com/crimestats/), there have been 408 homicides in 2023, while there were 514 in 2022. Philadelphia police publish crime statistics weekly, and the [report released on Dec. 24](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NnwLSzGtjKhtr3nF68fLMKEkyebylIbN) shows that rates of other violent crimes in the city also decreased in 2023. The latest report says there were 11% fewer rapes than in 2022, 24% fewer shooting incidents (over 3,000 this year, compared to over 4,000 last year) and a 7% decline in violent crime overall. In 2021 there was a record [ 562 homicides in Philadelphia](/philadelphia-violent-crime-decrease-shootings-homicides-robberies/). Interim police commissioner John Stanford credited the decrease to a public calming as the pandemic eased, along with increased policing, particularly around North Philly. \"We pulled people out of administrative positions, put them out on the street, every class that came out of police academy in 2023 were sent out to (four North Philly police) districts,\" Stanford told [6ABC](https://6abc.com/violent-crime-philadelphia-police-gun-violence-district-attorney/14235716/). Community efforts to reduce crime also may have contributed to the sharp decline in violent offenses. The city's budget last year put at least $155 million toward [anti-violence prevention](/philadelphia-homicides-2021-gun-violence-funding-rebecca-rhynhart-report/) through long-term solutions, such as intervention programs and other initiatives to improve socioeconomic conditions in communities most at risk of violence. On the downside, property crimes, including retail theft and carjackings, have risen. Retail theft has increased by almost 28%, while stolen vehicles skyrocketed by 72%. Overall, property crimes have increased by more than 15% compared to last year. District Attorney Larry Krasner appeared to blame the number of car thefts to flaws in the cars themselves. \"Thank you, Mr. Hyundai. Thank you, Mr. Kia. It would be nice if you made a car children couldn't steal, but that's what is happening there,\" Krasner told 6ABC. This year also saw a [looting spree](/72-charged-philadelphia-looting-unrest/) that resulted in 72 people being charged. \"We've been working closely with the new challenges of retail theft,\" Krasner said. \"These are challenges that were not there before.\"",
