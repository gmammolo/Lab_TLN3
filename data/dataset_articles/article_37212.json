  "text": "What was meant to be a memorable weekend backpacking trip in the Sierra ended in heartbreak for a Prather family.\nA beloved father, grandfather, husband, and outdoorsman, Robert “Bob” Gretsch, never made it back from the trail.\nGretsch, 68, was hiking the Cliff Lake Trail near Courtright Reservoir with his son and grandson when he became separated from the group Sunday evening.\nHis family says Bob was an experienced hiker, well-prepared and familiar with the area, so at first, they weren’t concerned.\n“He said, ‘Give me a minute, I’ll catch up,’” said his son Robert. “So we kept going back toward the truck, thinking he’d meet us there.”\nWhen he didn’t show, the family returned to search but still couldn’t find him.\nSearch and rescue teams were called in, and by Monday morning, it was another hiker who found Bob’s body. A helicopter was dispatched to recover him.\nAccording to deputies, there were no visible injuries, his family believes he suffered a sudden cardiac episode.\nAlthough Bob had beaten prostate cancer a few years ago, his family says he’d been healthy and active ever since.\n“We did everything together,” said Robert. “We had just gotten back from deep sea fishing in Monterey and Santa Cruz. He loved being out there.”\nWhether it was skiing black diamond slopes, fishing, or backpacking, Bob lived for adventure and spent much of it alongside his grandchildren. His grandson Reece shared some of the lessons passed down from their outdoor trips.\n“Don’t tie a bad knot,” Reece recalled with a smile. “If you do, your whole line can fall apart, especially if you hook a big one.”\nBob started both of his grandchildren skiing before their first birthdays, and he spent years teaching them the skills he loved.\nHe also worked for Fish and Game, served on the ski patrol at China Peak, and even taught tree felling with Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service.\n“He did it all,” Robert said. “And he made us who we are.”\nWhile Bob’s sudden passing has left a deep void in the family, they say they take comfort knowing he died doing what he loved—surrounded by nature, with the people he loved most by his side.\nA GoFundMe has been set up to help his wife with final expenses, as Bob did not have life insurance.\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/bobs-sudden-passing-support-needed",
