  "text": "Mark Latham is a \"pig\" who would have been sacked from any normal workplace, according to one of the most senior ministers in the NSW government.\nHousing Minister Rose Jackson, who also holds a range of other portfolios including mental health, today told reporters she has long opposed Latham's behaviour.\n\"Mark Latham is a pig,\" she told reporters.\n\"I've been on the record about that for a long time...\n\"This man has attacked Rosie Batty, told her to grieve in private. This man is well known, on the record, multiple times, as a bigot.\n\"He's one of the biggest bigots in the state.\"\nJackson had been questioned about her views on Latham following a string of allegations made against the NSW upper house MP this week, including of\ndomestic abuse against former partner Nathalie Matthews.Latham has strenuously denied the allegations made by Matthews, saying he will fight them in court.\nHe has also defended sending explicit texts from the floor of parliament by saying he's only \"guilty of being a human\".\nYesterday, further accusations of inappropriate behaviour in parliament were levelled against Latham.\nThe Daily Telegraph reported he had\nsecretly taken pictures of female MPs in the upper housebefore sending them to Matthews, while the two were still in their relationship, with disparaging comments about their appearances.\"It's extremely confronting for me to think that in a workplace there's someone who thinks it's acceptable to take photos of you, to share them with derogatory comments,\" Jackson said.\n\"In any other workplace, you'd be shown the door immediately, and rightfully so... I don't like working in a workplace with someone like that.\"\nThe Sydney Morning Herald also reported claims that\nsex tapes had been allegedly recorded in Latham's Parliament House office.Premier Chris Minns said he believed Latham had breached parliamentary rules and would have been sacked from any other job because of his behaviour.\n\"Even above and beyond the allegations made in the last week, he's been appalling for a long time,\" Minns said.\nThe government is set to explore sanctioning Latham over the allegations, although parliament is highly unlikely to be able to remove him before his current eight-year term in the Legislative Council ends in 2031.\nThe former federal Labor opposition leader is already facing investigation by the powerful privileges committee and a condemnation motion for using parliamentary privilege to reveal confidential medical information about independent Sydney MP Alex Greenwich.\nEarlier this year, Latham was found by the Federal Court to have defamed Greenwich for a defamatory tweet that explicitly described a sex act.\nHe was ordered to pay $140,000 in damages plus a large proportion of Greenwich's legal costs, but is appealing the decision.\n\"His pattern of behaviour is clear, and we have already indicated that we intend to condemn it (in parliament),\" Jackson said.\nSupport is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at",
