  "text": "Jack Graham: Banned West Coast Eagle still in Adelaide amid ‘challenging time’ following homophobic slur\nJack Graham remains in South Australia amid the fallout from his homophobic slur, with West Coast granting the recruit leave in the first week of his four-match suspension.\nGraham copped a hefty ban from the AFL after admitting to using an inappropriate word directed toward a GWS player during their clash at Optus Stadium earlier this month.\nThe revelation of the 27-year-old’s discretion emerged on Sunday morning just hours before the Eagles’ loss to Port Adelaide.\nSign up to The Nightly's newsletters.\nGet the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox.\nBy continuing you agree to ourTermsand\nPrivacy Policy.\nWest Coast coach Andrew McQualter confirmed on Thursday that Graham had been given the opportunity to remain in South Australia with family after the incident, having travelled with the team in the lead-in to Sunday’s game.\n“We’ve given Jack a few days away,” he said.\n“He’s staying with some family for a little bit of time.\n“He is going OK. It’s a challenging time for him and other people as well within our organisation and society so we challenge Jack’s behaviour but we’ll support the person.”\nIt is Graham’s first year at the Eagles after they recruited the two-time Richmond premiership midfielder on a four-year deal, along with long-time teammate Liam Baker.\nIt is not yet clear whether Graham will be back at the club ahead of their clash against his former side at Optus Stadium on Saturday night.\nWest Coast have defended the process undertaken which resulted in a suspension to Graham despite widespread criticism, including from former coach Adam Simpson.\n“Why isn’t this decided on Monday or Tuesday, like everything else is decided by Monday or Tuesday, like tribunals, indiscretions, all these types of things, especially when the game is on a Friday?” Simpson said.\nFormer AFL coach and West Coast and North Melbourne player Danielle Laidley warned of the dangers of homophobic language in football.\n“I have walked both roads. I have walked as a competitive AFL footballer, and sometimes some things are said and they shouldn’t be,” she told The West Australian.\n“But I am also part of the transgender community, and I know when I was playing football, if there was a conversation about ‘who was the gay footballer’ that would give me really bad anxiety, and I would withdraw and think ‘oh my God, do people know about me?’\n“It is a shame that it has happened, but we must continue to support and educate people and that’s what we need to do.”\nOriginally published on The West Australian",
