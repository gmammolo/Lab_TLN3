  "text": "Jennifer Lopez says she’s “done” with marriage following four divorces. When Lopez, 55, took the stage for her concert in Bilbao, Spain, on Wednesday, July 16, she noticed a fan sign that read, “J. Lo, marry me?” “I think I’m done with that,” the singer and actress replied, laughing. “I’ve tried that a few times.” Footage of Lopez’s response was posted via X , where a fan remarked, “She is soooo real for this.” A History of Jennifer Lopez’s Past Divorces: From Ojani Noa to Ben Affleck She is currently in Europe for her Up All Night Tour , which kicked off earlier this month and winds down in Kazakhstan on August 10. Lopez has been married four times, with each union ending in divorce. In February, she and Ben Affleck finalized their split five months after Lopez filed paperwork to end their marriage. The exes’ relationship had spanned more than 20 years. They first sparked a romance on the set of Gigli in 2001 and got engaged the following year. They were scheduled to walk down the aisle in September 2023, but called off their wedding several days ahead of the ceremony. Lopez and Affleck rekindled the flame in May 2021 and tied the knot in July 2022. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez’s $60 Million Marital Home Taken Off the Market After 1 Year By the spring of 2024, speculation swirled about their marital status. The pair had not been seen together for nearly two months. Us Weekly confirmed that May that Affleck moved out of their Beverly Hills home. A source exclusively told Us in June 2024 that they couldn’t “get on the same page [and had] been discussing divorce as an option.” The following month, another source told Us , “They are going through so much individually and as a couple. They may take some time to see if this complicated moment can resolve itself and they come back to each other [as] better people.” Last August, Lopez submitted her divorce filing herself, without using an attorney. As celebrity divorce lawyer attorney Chris Melcher told Us at the time, her solo move was “intentional to send a message that this will not be a fight.” Jennifer Lopez Channels Her Inner Broadway Performer in 1st Trailer for ‘Kiss of the Spider Woman’ She was previously married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003 and Marc Anthony — with whom she shares twins Max and Emme — from 2004 to 2014. (Affleck, for his part, was married to Jennifer Garner from 2005 to 2018, and they coparent their three children, Violet, Seraphina and Samuel.) Earlier this month, Lopez invited 30 of her Los Angeles-based fans to a listening party where she debuted six new songs , including the pop ballad “Wreckage of You,” which she is currently performing on tour. Edgardo Luis Rivera , who attended the event, told Us that Lopez “said she was lying in bed after a long day of tour rehearsals when the idea of [“Wreckage of You”] came to her. She mentioned how last year was a very difficult time for her both personally and professionally. She had to cancel her tour and really focus on herself. Fast-forward to one year later, and she feels better and stronger than ever, so she wanted to write a song about coming out of a bad situation much stronger.”",
