  "text": "The little girl critically injured in the creche attack in\nDublin in November is 'out of danger' – and has even smiled. The incident took place at Gaelscoil Cholaiste Mhuire on Parnell Square East in the city centre.\nTop line\nThe five-year-old child, who suffered serious injuries, is still receiving hospital treatment – but her mum says her condition has now improved. The girl's mum took to a special GoFundMe page on Thursday and gave a major health update.\nNews of the girl’s improvement came as Riad Bouchaker (50) of no fixed abode, made his second court appearance over the alleged attack.\nREAD MORE: ‘Unimaginable sadness’ - tributes paid to Clare youth Tim O’Dwyer after tragic Christmas Day death in New Zealand\nMr Bouchaker is charged with three counts of attempted murder, one of producing and possessing a 36cm kitchen knife, three counts of assault causing harm and one of assault causing serious harm.\nHe was remanded in custody on Thursday to appear at\nCloverhill District Court in west Dublin on January 25.\nThe same court heard that he is to face trial in front of a judge and jury on the charges and a book of evidence is now being prepared.\nWhat has been said\nThe girl's mum told contributors to the\n'Barróg do Chailín Beag' (A Hug for a Little Girl) page on GoFundMe that her daughter left the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of CHI’s Temple Street Hospital, close to the scene of the attack, a fortnight ago.\nThe mother said: “Hi everyone, here is the little girl's mum. Just to wish everyone a delayed Christmas and a Happy new year. Our angel has been out of the PICU for two weeks now. She is more alert and even smiled.\n“We still have a long time still in hospital, but she is out of danger. Thank you everyone for all the help and support. All our love.”\nBackground\nThe child has been in hospital since the November 23 attack – in which two other kids and three adults were injured.\nWhat happens next\nThe GoFundMe page\n'Barróg do Chailín Beag' (A Hug for a Little Girl) is doing its best to help the family with costs following the incident and all donations are welcome. It has raised more than €58,000 so far for the child and her family. Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the latest news direct to your inbox",
