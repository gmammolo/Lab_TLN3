  "text": "The Houston Dynamo lost 3-0 against the struggling Vancouver Whitecaps FC in their first match at Shell Energy Stadium since the Gold Cup. “We got bullied today,” Dynamo coach Ben Olsen said. “This is a good team. We knew we would have to be almost perfect in our game plan. They showed commitment and were hungry and we weren’t.” Houston looked to get back into the win column on its return home after a splitting a two-game road trip: a 4-3 upset victory over the Western Conference leading San Diego FC and a 1-0 defeat to Real Salt Lake. The loss moved Houston a point behind Austin FC for the final playoff spot in the West as the playoff race tightens. Vancouver had lost four of its last five games. A goal in the fourth minute by Emmanuel Sabbi put Vancouver up 1-0 as the Whitecaps controlled the first 16 minutes with their aggressive attack, generating four more shots on goal before the Dynamo attempted one. “They were more up for it today than we were,” Olsen said. “They came down our throats, and we didn’t handle that well physically or maybe tactically.” Momentum swung back to Houston for the majority of the first half, as the Dynamo generated four more shots than the Whitecaps until a second Vancouver goal from midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, who was named to his first MLS All-Star team this season in June. A foul from defender Felipe Andrade in the 54th minute inside the box meant a penalty for Vancouver’s All-Star forward Brian White that goalkeeper Jonathan Bond managed to save, but White slotted home the rebound for his 10th goal of the season to bring the score to 3-0 Whitecaps. Goalkeeper Yohei Takaoka snuffed out attempts from Houston’s Jack McGlynn and Griffin Dorsey in the 67th and 68th minutes of play as the Dynamo struggled for quality chances on the night, registering only two shots on goal from their 13 total shots. “There’s no excuse for how we performed today,” Olsen said. “And we have a team coming up in Philadelphia that’s going to try and do the same thing Vancouver did today. So it’s up to us to respond.” Midfielder and captain Artur said the team continues to strive for more consistency as the season goes on. “Everyone is working hard, but we haven’t found out how to keep our level of performance consistent,” he said. “We can’t let games like this happen, especially at home. We cannot take any games off and must stay hungry and keep the killer mentality the rest of the season.” Houston’s next match is Saturday against the Philadelphia Union to Shell Energy Stadium on Saturday, in McGlynn’s first match against his former club. “It’ll be a fun game, and good to see everyone,” McGlynn said. “But once we step on the field, they’ll be just like any other opponent.” The Union currently lead the MLS in points with 46 and have allowed the fewest goals in the league with 22. “We got a lesson in physicality tonight,” Olsen said. “We know Philadelphia is a great and physical team, so we need to take that lesson and respond accordingly on Saturday.” The game against the Union will be the final match for the team before the MLS All-Star game in Austin on July 23 Sign up for Houston Chronicle newsletters here Read the original article on houstonchronicle.com",
