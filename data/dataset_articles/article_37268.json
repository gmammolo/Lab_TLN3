I physically can't sing, and I promise you on everything that I stand for I will make this up to you.\"\nRucker went on to play his hit 2013 \"Wagon Wheel\" as the crowd sang along.

Love y'all and see you soon!\"\nLast Saturday's show was the third stop on Rucker's ongoing 45-date international tour.
