  "text": "Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris is expected to begin training camp on the non-football injury (NFI) list after suffering a superficial eye injury in a July 4 fireworks accident. General manager Joe Hortiz said Wednesday the team is awaiting an in-person medical evaluation but expects Harris to report to the facility soon. “The plan is to probably put him on NFI,” Hortiz said via The Athletic’s Daniel Popper. “But nothing is set in stone.” Got That Big Kick Energy? Related Headlines The accident occurred in Harris’ hometown of Antioch, California , and he has been receiving treatment at Stanford Medical Center . Hortiz said the team’s medical staff has been in regular contact with doctors there and believes Harris is in good hands. “We felt like, hey, you’re there with those doctors, they’re great, get everything cleared up there,” Hortiz said. “Stanford doctors are going to be pretty good.” While the injury is not expected to impact Harris’ availability for the regular season, his absence at the start of camp opens the door for first-round rookie Omarion Hampton to see extended reps with the starters. Harris’ agent, Doug Hendrickson , described the injury as “superficial” and said his client is expected to be fully ready for the season. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport echoed that optimism, reporting Harris is “not expected to miss significant time.” Beyond football, the situation has a personal dimension. Hortiz said a close friend of Harris was severely injured in the same incident, and Harris was understandably focused on his friend’s condition. “There’s another layer to it,” Hortiz said. “His friend was severely injured. I was more concerned about his buddy.” Harris, 27, signed a one-year deal worth up to $9.25 million with the Chargers this offseason after spending four seasons with the Steelers. He never missed a game in Pittsburgh and totaled over 5,400 yards and 32 touchdowns . While the NFI designation delays Harris’ on-field debut with the Chargers, the team is confident this is a short-term issue. “Hopefully he heals quick,” Hortiz said. “You hate to see it, but we’re hopeful this is only temporary.” Subscribe to LAFB Network’s Los Angeles Chargers YouTube Channel Related Headlines",
