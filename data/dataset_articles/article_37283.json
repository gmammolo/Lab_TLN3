  "text": "New Yorkers are expressing skepticism after Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani appeared to try to distance himself from the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" after spending months refusing to condemn the phrase many interpret as a call for violence against Jewish people.\nThe New York Times reported that Mamdani, who is Muslim and a self-professed socialist who has been highly critical of the state of Israel, told city business leaders that he would not use the phrase and that he would \"discourage\" others from doing so.\nThe Times reported that Mamdani told some 150 business executives present at the meeting, which took place in the Rockefeller Center, that while many use the phrase to express solidarity with Palestinians, others see it as a call to antisemitic violence.\nThis comes after Mamdani refused to condemn intifada language throughout his campaign for the Democratic mayoral nomination. During an interview on NBC’s \"Meet the Press\" in June, Mamdani said, \"My concern is, to start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible, takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things, putting people in jail for writing an op-ed, putting them in jail for protesting.\"\nAOC WELCOMES SOCIALIST MAMDANI TO NATION'S CAPITAL AS DEM LEADERS WITHHOLD ENDORSEMENTS\nHe said that \"ultimately, it is not language that I use. It is language, I understand there are concerns about, and what I will do is showcase my vision for the city through my words and my actions.\"\nNow, weeks after winning the Democratic nomination and facing general election voters, he appears to finally be backing away from the intifada language.\nJoe Borelli, a former Republican New York City Council member, responded to the shift, telling Fox News Digital it is \"hard to imagine any change of heart being genuine when it occurs right after you’ve won a primary and have to pivot for the general, which happens to include a heck of a lot of Jews.\"\nRory Lancman, a Democrat and former New York City councilmember and state assemblyman, told Fox News Digital that \"a putative mayor of New York City needs to be able to repudiate calls for 'intifada' without ambiguity or qualification as morally repugnant and unacceptable.\"\n'EXISTENTIAL THREAT': JEWISH LEADERS WARN OF NYC 'MASS EXODUS' IF ZOHRAN MAMDANI WINS IN NOVEMBER\n\"There is no 'threading the needle' or middle ground on this issue, or, for that matter, on the issue of whether Israel should be extinguished as a Jewish state,\" Lancman went on.\n\"These are basic, straightforward 'good vs. evil' questions that Mr. Mamdani struggles with because, frankly, he's on the wrong side of that equation,\" said Lancman.\nMore from this section +3 Markets shrug off Trump tariff threat against EU",
