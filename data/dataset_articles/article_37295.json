  "text": "Editor’s note: The Marion County Animal Shelter has two full-time employees, two part-time employees and two trustees that comprise its entire staff. MARION COUNTY, S.C. (WBTW) — Between its three facilities, the Marion County Animal Shelter houses 120 dogs — and it relies on just six workers to help keep the whole operation afloat. “Right now, we are playing it day-by-day, hour-by-hour, and doing everything we can to keep everyone alive on the property,” said director Bree Courcy. Passing by the site, cries for help aren’t audible until someone steps inside. Shelter officials say they’ve already taken in 900 dogs just this year alone and expect to surpass last year’s total of 1,400. From feeding, bathing, veterinary runs and rescue transports, the shelter’s workers also manage social media feeds. One woman who spoke off-camera to News13 on Tuesday said she drove 40 minutes to drop off supplies that otherwise would have ended up in the trash. “I think a lot of it is the community. We’ve got to all kind of come together and show that support, because we didn’t ask for these animals to be here, and they didn’t ask to be here,” Courcy said. Although they aim to be a no-kill site, Courcy and her staff spend hours every day figuring out how they can help as many dogs as possible in such a limited space. But without the support of adoptions and fosters, sometimes they’re left with no other option. “I have held dogs that were not my dogs. I have sobbed over their bodies. It is not something that we take lightly. I want to tear up just thinking about,” Courcy said. “If I have to make those types of decisions, it’s devastating.” The anguish of rehabilitating animals just to sometimes have to put them down because of space constraints is heartbreaking, she said. “That’s all it comes down to. There’s not enough time,” she said. Courcy asks community members to make the drive to their rural shelters, and there are plans to add more in the future, with help from the county.
