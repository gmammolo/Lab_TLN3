  "text": "( KRON ) — The ex-wife of a California professor who was gunned down by a masked assailant in a suburb of Athens, Greece , earlier this month has been arrested — and she’s suspected of arranging his killing, according to a Greek media report . Przemyslaw Jeziorski, a 43-year-old professor of marketing at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, was visiting his children in the Athens suburb of Agia Paraskevi when he was shot and killed in broad daylight on July 4. The masked shooter reportedly shot Jeziorski five times. According to Greek news outlet Tovima, the native of Poland was walking to his ex-wife’s home to see the couple’s two children, who are twins. According to Tovima, Jeziorski’s ex-wife has been arrested and charged with convincing her current partner to kill Jeziorski in a “gangland-style” shooting. Three other men, two Albanian nationals and a Bulgarian man, have also reportedly been arrested in connection to the case. Greek police, according to Tovima, say the three foreign nationals transported the alleged shooter to the scene and provided him with a Tokarev model automatic handgun, the alleged murder weapon. Jeziorski, who had been a faculty member of the Haas School of Business since 2012, was reportedly declared dead at the scene. “We are heartbroken by the tragic and sudden death of Professor Przemysław Jeziorski, a beloved member of our marketing faculty and Haas community,” said Haas School of Business Dean Jennifer Chatman in a statement. “While authorities are investigating what happened, our immediate focus is on supporting our community during this difficult period. My heart goes out to Przemek’s family and loved ones. We will miss him.” According to his faculty bio, Jeziorski was an associate professor of Marketing at UCB “with over 15 years of experience in research and teaching.” He had been at the Haas School of Business since 2012. Prior to that, he studied at the SGH Warsaw School of Economics, the University of Arizona, the University of Chicago, and Stanford University. He also previously taught at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Arizona, according to the Daily Cal. In addition to his academic career, Jeziorski was also the co-founder of Keybee, a short-term rental management app. For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to WSPA 7NEWS.",
