  "text": "San Diego FC could've used a proven goal scorer Wednesday night.\nToronto shut out SDFC 1-0, for their second win in eight matches. The visitors arrived with just 18 points on the season, tied for the second worst record in Major League Soccer.\nStream San Diego News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC 7.\n WATCH HERE Toronto led 1-0 after a 20th minute penalty kick. Franco Negri committed a foul in the penalty area, surrendering the attempt that Theo Corbeanu converted to give the visitors a leg up.\nSan Diego FC controlled possession like usual in the first half, but headed to the locker room without anything to show for it - not even a single shot.\nGet top local San Diego stories delivered to you every morning with our News Headlines newsletter.\n SIGN UP SDFC held possession for 70.1 percent of the match but only registered two shots on goal.\nIt was a physical match that got chippy at points, with the clubs combining for nine yellow cards.\nThere was a controversial non-call on a handball in the second half that would've given San Diego a shot to get level.\nThe result comes a day after the club parted ways with second leading scorer after the sides failed to reach an agreement on an extension to Iloski's loan, which was set to expire at month's end.\nDespite the loss San Diego FC ends the night where it began - sitting atop the Western Conference table. Second place Minnesota lost 1-0 to LAFC, while third place Vancouver topped Houston 3-0. The Whitecaps started the night four points back of SDFC.\nSan Diego is home for its next five matches, including Saturday's visit from Vancouver.",
