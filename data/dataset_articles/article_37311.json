  "text": "ARTESIAN, S.D. (KELO) – A community is mourning the loss of a husband and wife who died in a house fire in Sanborn County. Authorities say Dave Larson, 81 and Paula Larson, 79, died Wednesday, July 9 as a result of the fire. At their home in Artesian cars were seen left in the driveway, broken windows and burned siding. “Everybody just largely felt a huge loss and a lot of shock. Those kinds of tragedies don’t happen very often,” Pastor Richard Poppen with Fedora Endeavor Presbyterian Church said. Poppen married the two in Artesian back in 1973. He says the husband and wife played a big role in the church. Dave was the treasurer, historian and took care of maintenance, and Paula accompanied the choir. “Really enjoyed the music part of it, whether it was keyboard for Paula or just singing for both of them,” Poppen said. Beyond the walls of the church, the family owned a grocery store “Larson Feed & Grocery” that now displays a closed sign and their obituaries.\nPoppen says Dave also volunteered at the Fedora Fire Department. “They just enjoyed having a good time with the community, with friends here at the church and all in and everywhere in the community,” Poppen said. Poppen says following their deaths, people in the area have been rallying together to help fill the big hole the two left behind. “Last Wednesday night after the tragedy folks came to the church here and met. And by the time the night was over, all their positions had been volunteered for except for one and we think we have that taken care of,” Poppen said. As family members and friends are remembering the couples legacy on the small town. “The beauty of it all is that there’s an interest in continuing on, even in the midst of sadness,” Poppen said. The couples’ oldest son Ed Larson says authorities believe it was an electrical fire that started near the air conditioner. Officials told him the fire was reported at around 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, but an investigation is still ongoing. “Mom and dad were good people rooted in community. They showed up, were always at church every Sunday and showed up to ball games, plays and events,” Ed Larson said. Both of the funerals will be held at the church in Fedora on August 2.
