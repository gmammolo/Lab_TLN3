  "text": "The Arkansas Razorbacks are no longer set to play Mount St. Mary's as a part of their loaded 2025-26 non-conference schedule, sources have confirmed to HawgSports. The Hogs and Mountaineers were originally set to meet on Dec. 16 in Bud Walton Arena. Sources said the Razorbacks will still have a home game on Dec 16, but the opponent is unclear now.\nRocco Miller of Bracketeer.org was the first to report on the matchup between the two teams. This is the second non-conference matchup to be canceled for the Hogs. As their matchup with the Baylor Bears in Fayetteville was canceled according to Arkansas head coach John Calipari, and it'll likely be pushed to the 2026-27 season.\nDespite these matchups no longer being on the schedule, the Hogs still have a loaded 2025-26 slate with marquee matchups across the board. Some notable opponents they'll face are the Duke Blue Devils on Thanksgiving Day at the United Center in Chicago, Louisville in the SEC/ACC Challenge from Bud Walton Arena on December 3, Texas Tech in a Sweet 16 rematch from the American Airlines Arena in Dallas on December 13, and the national champion runner up Houston from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 20.\n\"You schedule to your team,\" Calipari said. \"You don't schedule because you just want to schedule, you've got to look and say, 'Ok, where are we? Is this too much for these guys? Are we being fair?' So yeah, this schedule is good. We're talking about every team in the Elite Eight we're playing. We're also looking at some of the what they'd call buy games against teams that were in the NCAA Tournament a year ago.\"\nThe Razorbacks are currently set to play 17 games against teams from last season's NCAA Tournament. As Calipari also mentioned that the Hogs will play every single team that appeared in the Elite Eight last season. (Auburn, Michigan State, Florida, Texas Tech, Duke, Alabama, Houston and Tennessee).\nHere's a simplified look at the schedule with everything we've learned and outlined above:\nNon-Conference\nTBA (Exhibition) - Memphis - FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tenn.\nNov. 3 - Southern - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nNov. 11 - Central Arkansas - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nTBA - TBA (CBS Sports Thanksgiving MTE) - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nTBA - TBA (CBS Sports Thanksgiving MTE) - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nNov. 27 - Duke (CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic) - United Center in Chicago\nDec. 3 - Louisville (SEC/ACC Challenge) - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nDec. 13 - Texas Tech - American Airlines Center in Dallas, Tex.\nDec. 16 - TBA - Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, Ark.\nDec. 20 - Houston - Barclays Center in Brooklyn\nTBA - at Michigan State - Breslin Center in East Lansing, Mich.\nTBA - TBA - Verizon Arena in North Little Rock, Ark.\nSEC\nHome - Auburn, LSU, Missouri, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Texas A&M, Vanderbilt\nAway - Auburn, LSU, Missouri, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Oklahoma\nHAWGSPORTS LIVE PODCAST:\nBe sure to check out the latest episodes of HawgSports Live on Apple Podcast, Spotify, Google Podcast or wherever you prefer to listen.
