  "text": "Shares of JTL Industries Ltd slipped 4.32% to close at ₹78.10 on Thursday after the company reported weak financial results for Q1 FY26 on a year-on-year basis.\nThe company posted a 44% YoY decline in net profit for the June quarter, even though EBITDA per tonne improved sequentially (QoQ). While sales volume rose and EBITDA margins expanded slightly on a QoQ basis, investors reacted negatively to the steep YoY drop in profitability.\nJTL Industries’ revenue from operations came in at ₹543.9 crore, up 5.5% YoY. However, profit after tax fell sharply to ₹16.55 crore from around ₹29.5 crore in Q1 FY25. The company reported a total sales volume of 1,08,406 MT , which grew 26.5% YoY, and value-added products accounted for 20% of sales.\nDespite sequential improvement in EBITDA per tonne and margins, the overall earnings performance remained weak compared to the same quarter last year, which led to selling pressure in the stock.\nThe stock closed at ₹78.10 on NSE, down 4.32% for the day.\nDisclaimer: The information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial or investment advice.
