  "text": "Jenny Saywood\nQueen’s Service Medal for services to restorative justice and women\nWhanganui’s Jenny Saywood has been recognised for services to restorative justice and women with a Queen’s Service Medal (QSM) in the New Year Honours.\nSaywood was a founding member of Restorative Justice in Whanganui in 1999 and has chaired Restorative City Whanganui Trust since 2012.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. The trust is a provider of a court-referred restorative justice programme and has advocated for victim-centric and te ao Māori approaches\nIn 2012 Saywood led a team to engage with local organisations, businesses and schools to provide training on how to implement restorative practices within their organisations.\n“It has been very rewarding to see restorative practices adopted in Whanganui,” Saywood said.\n”The practice had been very effective in the court system and helping to extend it into the community where it has become part of people’s everyday lives has been very satisfying work for me.\nAdvertisement Advertise with NZME. ”Saywood said her first profession was early childhood teaching before heading overseas where she spent a decade travelling and living in England.\nAfter working in hospitality and administrative roles, she retrained and became a probation officer in Chelmsford, Essex.\nShe later moved to Norfolk with her English husband.\n”We ran out of fuel for the fire one very cold winter and my English husband agreed that New Zealand would be a better place to live.”\nAfter settling in Whanganui, Saywood joined the St Johns Hill School board where her children attended and started the first Neighbourhood Watch group in the suburb in the 1980s.\nShe was employed with the Department of Corrections from 1991 to 2015 and championed better reintegration pathways and a whole-of whānau approach.\nSaywood was justice reference group leader for the Safer Whanganui steering group until 2023, advocating for safe reintegration of prisoners in the community and issues of family harm and violence against women.",
