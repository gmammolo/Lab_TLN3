  "text": "10 YEARS AGO\nJuly 16, 2015\nIt was originally supposed to be a vigil of prayer for the safe discovery and return of missing 9-year old Omarion Humphrey, but after the boy’s remains were found in Lake Callis earlier in the day, the vigil became a memorial service in his memory. A vigil organizer by Davison Mayor Tim Bishop and several Davison area pastors was held July 10 at the base of the sledding hill in Jack Abernathy Regional Park, a short distance from where Omarion’s body was discovered by Lake Callis staff earlier in the day. Bishop said the vigil was a memorial to help Omarion’s family and the people of the Davison community “heal” after a heart wrenching week of non-stop searching for the missing autistic boy who disappeared at Lake Callis on July 4 while in the care of his foster family. More than 100 people attended the vigil, holding candles and letting a couple of lantern fly into the nighttime sky in memory of the little boy.\nDue to construction on the Davison High tennis courts, the annual Davison Tennis Camp was moved to Kearsley this year under varsity tennis coach Walt White. Including all of the sessions, coach White will instruct nearly 30 kids total. Along with the tennis instruction, though, White tries to teach lessons that can apply to the kids both on and off the court while keeping them entertained in the process. The camp has several sessions and does have a cost, but it is a very economical fee for a camp that can help the kids make great strides in their athletic ability.\n25 YEARS AGO\nJuly 19, 2000\nKathy Streeter is one of the veteran vendors who will be selling products at the Farmers Market this season. Streeter did not set up her stand the first week due to the fact that her produce was not quite ready. The stand was however open Friday, July 15. This will be the seventh year that Streeter, a Davison resident of 21 years; her husband, Greg, sons, Joey and Casey; and daughter Katie will be selling their goods at the market.\nThe Richfield Township Board of Trustees announced a promotion for Sgt. Wayne R. Cox at their meeting July 11. Cox, a 22-year veteran of the department, is the township’s first lieutenant. The promotion came as a small surprise; he was only informed of it last week. As the department’s lieutenant, he will serve as the night shift supervisor. Police Chief Boyd Skellenger said a supervisor on the night shift is necessary as the township grows. Skellenger also added in the very near future, an officer will be appointed to sergeant to fill Cox’s vacated spot.\n50 YEARS AGO\nJuly 30, 1975\nThe city council told Monday night that the new Davison Regional Park could be done as early as late September. If everything goes according to the present schedule. The park has been under construction for some time. The council authorized payment for $12,681.81 at their meeting Monday night. At the time they also approved changes in the construction of restroom facilities at the park to conform with new state law covering barrier-free design. One problem was brought to the council’s attention by City Superintendent Jack Abernathy – the parking lot at the park has some deep ruts in it, caused by heavy equipment. Tests are now being done to determine who is at fault for the problem.\nThe history subcommittee of the Davison Area Bicentennial Committee has been meeting regularly, researching information on writing about the history of Davison. Printed documents, manuscripts, personal papers, photographs and oral interviews will be studied and authenticated to preserve and report Davison’s history.\n100 YEARS AGO\nJuly 17, 1925\nThe work of rebuilding the electric light and power line between Lapeer and Davison will mean that service will be out for some days and customers are asked to take notice of the Michigan Electric Power Co. advertisement. Beginning Tuesday, July 21 service will be shut off every day from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. until the work is completed. For the protection of their workmen, the company is forced to cut off the service.\nTomorrow is the last day on which to pay Ira Cole the $2 assessment on your lot in Pine Grove Cemetery. After that you are in arrears. Read your bylaws. — Compiled by Gary Gould from the archives of the Davison Index",
