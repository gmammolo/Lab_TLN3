  "text": "Scott Frost says 2017 success helped pave UCF’s path to Big 12\nNearly eight years later, Scott Frost hasn’t forgotten what that perfect season meant. Not just for him and the players, but for UCF as a rising football program.\nSpeaking last week during Big 12 Media Days at The Star in Frisco, Texas, Frost reflected on the legacy of that year and how it helped position the Knights for their current place on the Power Four stage.\n“2017, that was a special group of guys,” Frost said. “I really believe that the success we had in those years, even after 2017, positioned UCF to be in a position where it could be considered to be in the Big 12.”\nFrost went 13-0 during his second season at UCF, capping the year with a Peach Bowl win over Auburn. The Knights claimed a National Championship, later recognized by the NCAA, and were central to the debate about Group of Five access to the College Football Playoff. That run, Frost said, elevated UCF’s national profile at a crucial time.\n“We’re in a completely different spot because we’re in this league and we didn’t get left behind,” Frost said. “I think that 2017 had a lot to do with that.”\nWith the expanded 12-team playoff format beginning last season, Frost believes UCF now has the access it lacked during that historic run. But he also knows the climb gets steeper from here.\n“If there’s any more changes down the road, it’s our job as guardians of UCF football right now, custodians of UCF football, to try to have as much success as we can, to try to be positioned well if there are any more changes,” he said. “That’s one of my goals at UCF, is to help elevate it to that kind of position.”\nAs for whether UCF could ever recapture that same type of magic?\n“There’s no way you could have a better two-year turnaround than what we had,” Frost said. “I thought it would be a three-year turnaround when I came. I thought we’d have to recruit to it and develop to it. You can change a team faster now because of the transfer portal.”\nBut Frost was quick to add that the new era, and the Big 12, bring greater challenges.\n“We’re in a different league now too. This is a tough league with a lot of well-established football teams, good coaches,” he said. “I don’t think you have to go undefeated to have success. We need to keep making improvements and give ourselves chances in games and start winning.”\nAnd now, with a clear playoff path in front of them, Frost believes UCF has the infrastructure and potential to do something special.\n“If you do start winning at UCF, because of our location and ability to attract talent, some really special things could happen,” Frost said.\nSIGN UP: Join the UCFSports.com Community for $1 today",
