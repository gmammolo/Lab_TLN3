  "text": "Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has taken decisive regulatory action by suspending nine Umrah operators , which includes seven companies that were banned on July 15, 2025, along with two additional companies that were penalized a few days prior.\nThe ministry confirmed all suspended companies engaged in critical breaches: housing pilgrims in unlicensed accommodations , violating regulatory guidelines, and failing contractual obligations.\nThese practices directly compromised safety through exposure to facilities lacking fire exits, sanitation controls, and security protocols.\nImmediate legal proceedings against the companies are underway, with penalties including license revocation, fines exceeding 500,000 SAR, and mandatory pilgrim compensation.\n“We enforce zero tolerance for negligence,” stated Minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah. “Affected pilgrims are being relocated to licensed facilities with full itinerary protection.”\nUnlicensed accommodations – often overcrowded residential buildings – present documented risks:\nStructural hazards in non-compliant properties Absence of emergency medical response plans Sanitation failures violating health codes\nRecent inspections revealed 22% of suspended companies housed pilgrims in facilities without civil defense certification. The enforcement of the crackdown strengthens Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 reforms related to pilgrimage, which mandate:\nGovernment-certified accommodation only Real-time itinerary tracking via Nusuk app Financial guarantees covering service defaults\nOver 200 licensed operators remain operational under enhanced monitoring. Ongoing Measures The ministry has deployed 120 inspectors across Mecca and Medina, initiating surprise facility checks.\nA whistleblower portal (report.haj.gov.sa) allows public violation reporting.\nFuture violations will trigger permanent license cancellations and criminal charges.",
