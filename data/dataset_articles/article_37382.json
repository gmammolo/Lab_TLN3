  "text": "Changes to some parking charges in York following backlash from businesses\nPrices went up in April y\nSome changes to parking charges in York are coming into force today (17 July).\nThe new pricing model introduces a price of £3 per hour (or £2.10 per hour for residents with a Minster discount badge) for a maximum of 3 hours in community car parks and residential areas outside the inner ring road.\nCouncillor Kate Ravilious, Executive Member for Transport:\n“Following the introduction of new charges across the city earlier in the year, we listened to what people were telling us and made some adjustments. These changes are now being put in place.\n“We’re grateful for those who’ve worked with us in reaching these decisions.\n“While we remain committed to tackling congestion and making it easier for everyone to get around, we recognise some of the uplift in charges in areas where they were previously very low has felt too much in one go.\n“Alongside the changes to parking charges aimed at supporting residents and local businesses, we will continue to invest in improving bus services, including extending Park and Ride hours from the 20 July; and developing walking and cycling provision in York to provide alternative travel options in York.”\nDifferent car-parking charges will be applied depending on the area the parking is located in, with lower rates in community car parks and on-street areas serving residential and local high streets outside of the inner ring road.\nThese car parks include: Bishopthorpe Road car park; East Parade car park and Rowntree Park car park.\nOther changes that will come into effect, include:\n• On-street parking charges in areas outside of the inner ring road will move to the £3 per hour rate\n• an increase in the discount for the Minster Badge to 30% of the standard parking charge, from the current 24% to reduce the impact of increased parking charges on residents\n• No Friday, Saturday, event uplift or evening charge at Community car parks or on-street parking areas outside of the inner ring road.\n• adjustment to charges in the Micklegate and Priory Street area to the ‘outside the inner ring road’ on-street parking rate. City centre evening parking rates for this area will still apply\n• removing the proposed charges for dedicated motorcycle bays, recognising that the motorcycle bays are generally in locations where a car space is not possible\n• increase the discount for Low Emission vehicle permits to 20%, from the current 16% discount to set a discount that better reflects the contribution of all types of vehicles to congestion and takes into account the land-use impact of vehicle parking\n• Contract Parking permits will no longer be linked to Season Tickets, and will be set at last year’s prices, plus circa 5% increase, with a 20% discount for low emission vehicles\n• Coppergate car park will also be implementing cashless parking from 17 July, cash payments will still be accepted in Bootham Row and Castle Car Park\nHear all the latest news from across the UK on the hour, every hour, on Greatest Hits Radio on DAB, smartspeaker, at greatesthitsradio.co.uk, and on the Rayo app.",
