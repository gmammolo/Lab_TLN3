  "text": "Singer Moon Won, who will marry Shin Ji of the group Koyote next year, has been embroiled in a misunderstanding involving a transgender DM. Ultimately, it was a misunderstanding, but once again he was hurt by unnecessary fake news.Transgender BJ Kkotja said in a personal broadcast on the 16th, \"It is true that Moon Won and transgender Sarah knew each other from the past, but they did not get to know each other after her transition,\" adding, \"Moon Won was not aware that Sarah was gay or that she had become transgender.\"Earlier, during a broadcast conducted by Kkotja on the 11th, a viewer asked transgender Sarah, who appeared as a guest, \"How did you come to follow each other on social media?\" Sarah replied, \"Moon Won? Who is that?\" and stated, \"Upon checking, it is true that we follow each other.\"After that, Kkotja checked the DM on Sarah's mobile phone and appeared flustered, and Sarah was also surprised after checking the DM. When the viewers asked, \"If Kkotja gives 100 million won, can you disclose the message content?\" Sarah replied, \"It’s impossible,\" but when the amount was raised to 1 billion won, she said, \"Then it’s possible. I can also disclose Kakao messages for 500 million won.\"Regarding this, Kkotja explained, \"Those comments at that time did create room for misunderstanding. However, upon checking, there was no conversation content that could be problematic. The two originally knew each other simply as an older brother and younger sister during the time Sarah was preparing Trot music, even before she transitioned.\"He continued, \"Moon Won did not even know that Sarah was transgender, to the extent that he checked her social media account and asked, ‘Is it my girlfriend who's messing around?’ It’s possible he unfollowed in surprise, but it’s not a strange relationship at all. Recently, my photos have circulated and led to articles, but it's frankly nothing significant. Please don’t interpret this too excessively.\"Meanwhile, Shin Ji and Moon Won are scheduled to marry next year. On the 16th, Shin Ji shed tears recalling a time when she suffered from misunderstandings and rumors related to Moon Won during a broadcast of tvN's 'Yoo Quiz on the Block.'[OSEN]",
