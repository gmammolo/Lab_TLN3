  "text": "Sherrone Moore offers high praise for Alabama defense: 'Every guy on the defense will probably get drafted' Sherrone Moore thinks Alabama’s entire defense could be drafted to the NFL. Moore is well aware of how good the defenses have been under Nick Saban in Tuscaloosa. He compared the Crimson Tide defense to Michigan in that both teams played as one on that side of the ball. “First thing you’re gonna see is physicality. They’re gonna play with great fundamentals, great technique. They’re gonna be extremely gap sound. They play with discipline and they’re gonna be fast,” said Moore, the Michigan offensive coordinator. “They’re gonna be athletic at every position. Every guy on the defense will probably get drafted. You’re gonna see a lot of talented guys. Not only with the talent, you see a bunch of guys that play as a team and as a unit. Very similar to our defense.” Michigan offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore shares his thoughts on Alabama’s defense. “Every guy on the defense will probably be drafted.” [pic.twitter.com/SP0boZ1wH1] — James H. Williams covers UCLA football (@JHWreporter) [December 29, 2023] Alabama allowed 313.3 yards per game, which was the 2nd fewest in the SEC this year. Georgia allowed the fewest with 295.2 yards per game. The Crimson Tide also had 2nd fewest points per game in the SEC with 18.4. The defense will be tasked with slowing down Blake Corum and the Michigan offense. The Wolverines average 380.5 yards per game and 36.7 points per game. Kickoff from the Rose Bowl will be at 5 p.m. ET on ESPN on Monday.",
