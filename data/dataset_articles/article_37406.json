  "text": "On May 21, the $700 million dollar National\nSeptember 11 Memorial Museum opened to the general public,12 years and change\nafter that awful, now-historic day in September.\nThe museum provoked controversy\nfor years before it even opened. The astronomical cost – a mixture of private\nand government funding – to build the thing, as well as the $24 cost of admission\nis just one sore spot. More painfully, some families of 9/11 victims spent\nyears in court fighting the placement of 8,000 unidentified remains of some\n1000 people into a special mausoleum of sorts in the museum. These pieces of\nhuman beings are not going to be put on display for gawking tourists or anything,\nbut it’s perfectly understandable that family members would still find the prospect\nof bits of their loved ones sitting behind a museum door for all eternity to\nbe distressing. Yet, this is also the fundamental contrast between history and\npersonal sorrow. Though the former is made from the latter, it’s trickier to\nknow how to memorialize and remember when people who suffered or lost people\nare still here to witness how a tragedy is preserved.\nThis conflict was\nbeautifully explored by Buzzfeed’s Steve Kandell. In a recent essay, Kandell\ndescribes a gut-wrenching visit to the new museum after 12 years of his family’s\nattempts to mourn the sister they loved alone and without any of the pomp and\npolitics of having such \"special\" grief. Mostly, it’s a personal piece,\nbut Kandell mentions briefly his trouble with the loaded quality of 9/11. Or\nat least what came after – blowback is not mentioned. Still, one guy mourning\nhis sister should be forgiven for being unable to see the big picture; particularly\nwhen seeing the death of a sibling turned into a drop in the grand bucket is\na large part of what upsets him.\nThe 330 million people who tolerated two aggressive wars and a decade and\nmore of hysteria after 9/11 are another matter. And this brings up the question,\nwhat should be done about 9/11, historically? Can you make a museum about such\na political moment – to use the most banal term for murder being paid back by\nmore than two orders of magnitude – when it is still rippling throughout Iraq,\nPakistan, Afghanistan and all over the Middle East? When it is still being used\nto justify an incomprehensibly vast global spying enterprise? And when it gave\nus not only the PATRIOT Act, but\nalso what one writer dubbed \"the most dangerous sentence in U.S. history,\"\nthe Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)?\nYou can’t. Even Washington DC’s Holocaust Museum, which includes bunks from\nBuchenwald, Raoul Wallenberg’s passport, and other eerie, powerful objects ends\nwith an uncomfortably pro-Israel feeling. Maybe this is a US sickness, but it\nseems that there must be always be a message, a false hope at the end, or a\npeople avenged. It can’t just all be meaningless bloodshed, after all. Go check\nout any war memorial (except, arguably the Vietnam war one). You can’t honor\nthe dead when you’re still using them to fuel wars, so you had better make their\ndeath mean something big. Or, as Charles Madison says\nin the classic antiwar film The Americanization of Emily, \"The\nrest of us who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields… we\nperpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices.\" The soldiers who were conscripted\nand the ones who volunteered are mixed together as one in every troop tribute.\nThey’re all heroes, no matter what. The 9/11 victims are the same. This is so\nvile, and has been used to justify so much misery, that a few family members\nbeing outraged by the museum’s gift shop is really too much to worry over.\nThe New York Post first mentioned this\nbrewing outrage on May 18. Turns out the museum’s $63 million annual operating\nbudget – including at least $10 million annual security costs, how fitting are\nthose metal detectors and scanners! – will be eased by the sale of painfully\nearnest, yet completely crass merchandise such as $64 \"survivor tree earrings\"\nand $39 hoodies emblazoned with an image of the Towers. Family members of victims\nare quoted voicing their disgust, but this is a museum that cost $250 million\nin tax dollars. Offsetting the upkeep with good, old fashioned capitalism is\na fair trade for continually honoring the dead in this fashion. Victims’ families\ndidn’t ask for their loved ones to be cast as Important Deaths for all time,\nbut expensive souvenirs are such a lesser evil compared to the last 12\nyears that it’s hard to feel moved by their sorrow now.\nIn his Buzzfeed piece, Kandell wearily alludes to this when he writes \"The events of the day have already been exploited and sold in ways previously incomprehensible, why get mad at a commemorative T-shirt now?\" Indeed. People like Kandell lost friends and family, and then they had the privilege of their loss being the battle cry for destroying Iraq, invading Afghanistan, and sending drones endlessly patrolling over Yemen and Pakistan; not to mention the NSA spying on everything we do. That – not a pricey hoodie – is the tragedy.\nSeptember 11 is history. The wars that came after continue, yet they are becoming history as well. And history invariably becomes fodder for a middle school field trip, full of people half paying attention. It’s horrible, and a natural progression of time.\nStill, it was too soon for a 9/11 museum, since we are still stuck in the muddy habit of using that day as the magic incantation which makes every foreign adventure legal and right. We should have fixed the mess our policies made before we tried to cast them carefully in the past. But that might mean admitting some people died for no good reason – particularly the hundreds of thousands of individuals in the Middle East, who will get no $700 million tributes from us.\nLucy Steigerwald is a contributing editor for Antiwar.com and a columnist\nfor VICE.com.
