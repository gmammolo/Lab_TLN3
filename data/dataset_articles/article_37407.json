  "text": "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Patricia Ann Fleury. Born in Los Angeles California in 1941, she passed away peacefully with her daughters by her side, on June 14, 2025, at the age of 83. She was retired and loved shopping outings and going out to lunch, especially to El Palacio. She loved her loyal companion Buddy, her chihuahua. She is survived by her daughters Kathy Huntley (John) of Kingman, and Debbie Essig of Phoenix, and was preceded in death by her husband of 33 years, Robert Fleury. Her daughters enjoyed a quite celebration of her life and take comfort knowing she is at peace. She will be greatly missed and remembered with much love.
