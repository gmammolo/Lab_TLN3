  "text": "HONOLULU (KHON2) — More than 200 Hawaiian Airlines employees will receive Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notices by the end of the week, Hawaiian Airlines officials confirm. The company told KHON2 the layoffs will affect 252 Hawaii-based nonunionized employees, whose interim roles are expected to end in the fall. “These employees have been aware of this milestone and have done meaningful work to integrate our airlines in the first year of our combination, helping us deliver greater value to our guests,” said Alex Da Silva, Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson. Officials said 252 people will receive a retention bonus, severance package and individualized job placement services to help with their career transition. Employees are also encouraged to apply for open positions with Alaska or Hawaiian Airlines.
