  "text": "A Pasadena home on Garvey Drive was struck by a number of bullets from a dark SUV in a drive‑by shooting. A family of nine—including seven children—was inside, leaving the house and vehicles damaged.\nA Pasadena family says they were left shaken but unharmed after multiple gunshots were fired into their home early Wednesday morning while they were inside.Candance Sandoval told FOX 26 the incident occurred around 1:30 a.m. while she and her husband were at home with their seven children, ranging in age from three to 18.\"It was terrifying,\" Sandoval said. \"The bullets were whizzing by my kids. The TV just exploded. I've never heard my kids scream like that.\nSurveillance videos show a dark-colored SUV driving by the home several times before the shooting. Some of the last few shots were caught on a surveillance camera. Sandoval says over 20 bullet casings were found on the scene. \"Why would you try to hurt babies, innocent children that didn't do anything to you?\" Sandoval pleaded. \"If you have a problem...don't handle it this way. I would've been planning funerals instead of planning where we're going to live now.\nUnited States Latest News, United States Headlines\nSimilar News:You can also read news stories similar to this one that we have collected from other news sources.\nPasadena PD investigating apparent drive-by shooting that killed 19-year-old at apartment complexOfficials confirmed the victim died at the hospital after being shot at an apartment complex early Wednesday morning.\nRead more »\nPasadena PD investigating drive-by shooting after home hit with dozens of bullets with family insideA Pasadena family says they're left traumatized after dozens of bullets were fired into their home: 'It was the worst yell I've ever heard come from one of my children,' the mother said.\nRead more »\nHouston drive-by shooting outside Bugs Bar on Dixie Drive leaves 2 dead, 15 injuredTwo people were killed and five others were injured in a drive-by shooting outside Bugs Bar on Dixie Drive in southeast Houston on Sunday night, police say.\nRead more »\nDodgers Dugout: Who is their best first baseman, Freddie Freeman, Steve Garvey or Gil Hodges?The best first baseman in Dodgers history comes down to three names: Freddie Freeman, Steve Garvey and Gil Hodges.
