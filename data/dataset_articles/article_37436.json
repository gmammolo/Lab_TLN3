  "text": "Long-time Vancouver jazz champion Gavin Walker has died, with friends praising his devotion to the genre he loved\nGet the best of Vancouver in your inbox, every Tuesday and Thursday. Sign up for our free newsletter.\nGavin Walker, who has long been known as one of Vancouver's most impassioned champions of jazz, has died, with his passing mourning by family, friends, and long-time admirers.\nIn a Facebook post, his nephew Sean U’yenetsechia Smith wrote: I am posting to share that my uncle Gavin, my dad’s brother had passed away this past weekend. We share the news to notify family as well as Gavin’s many friends in Vancouver and beyond. Uncle Gavin loved his many friends which I think he felt were his family as we live in the Yukon.”\nHe added: “Yes it’s sad news to share but Uncle always loved to connect with his friends and family. We will truly remember what a cool dude uncle was and always will be.”\nOriginally from Montreal, Walker moved to Vancouver, working as an alto saxophonist, including a weekly gig at Gastown’s Classical Joint. Walker was a tireless supporter of the jazz scene on a grassroots level, which made him a regular at the Cellar Jazz/Cory’s Weeds’ Cellar Jazz Club.\nHe was perhaps best-known as the host of the long-running The Jazz Show on CiTR, which has been on the air since 1984.\nNardwuar the Human Serviette, who got to know Walker as a fellow CiTR host, told the Straight: “He was an absolute legend and I learned so much about Jazz from listening to his show. Such a huge loss. If not for Gavin I would know so much less. He was so good at what he did. He got people (like me!) to listen to jazz that they may not have otherwise!”\nVancouver photographer Gord McCaw, who’s been documenting Vancouver and its various music scenes since the late-’70s, told the Straight that Walker was a “kind, humble, witty as hell and a Gentleman...”\nNoting that they both worked as taxi drivers Black Top & Checker Cabs at one point in Vancouver, McCaw posted on Facebook: “I would see him around on the lot and we would trade jokes and scuttlebut of the taxi biz. Taxi driving was a good fit for misfits such as ourselves, in Gavin’s case an excellent alto horn player since the late 1950’s, in my case trying to pull something together as a freelance photographer. Most of the guys I knew in the biz were backstopping something else they’d rather be doing full time.”\nThat Walker never gave up jazz speaks volumes about his commitment to the genre he loved deeply.\nMcCaw noted that he reconnected with Walker after starting a Facebook group, and lunch meetups, for former taxi drivers.\n“Gavin was a charter member,” McCaw posted. “He had to bow out last month because he wasn’t feeling well, none of us knew in May that it was the last time we would see him. To say his loss will be deeply felt by all of us is an understatement. Rest well brother…”",
