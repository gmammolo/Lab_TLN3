  "text": "On July 14, Robin Kaye, a music supervisor for American Idol , and her husband, Thomas Deluca, were found murdered in what appeared to be a double homicide.\nKaye and Deluca’s bodies were found inside their house in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles after LAPD officers arrived for a welfare check.\nCops told neighbors that family members had not heard from the couple in four days. It is unknown who called for the welfare check.\n>IN MEMORIAM SLIDESHOW: 100 GREAT CELEBRITIES WHO DIED IN 2025\nAfter police officers noticed blood at the front entrance, they smashed a window to gain entry to the home, where they found the couple suffering from gunshot wounds. They were both declared dead at the scene.\nThe incident is being investigated as a double homicide. Kaye and Deluca were shot in the head and found in different rooms.\nPolice officers were reviewing surveillance footage. No arrests have been made in the case yet.\nIt does not appear to have been a burglary, as the home was not ransacked.\nPolice found no indications of a break-in when they replied to the 911 call.\nRobin worked as the music supervisor on American Idol for 15 seasons, according to her IMDB page. She won various Guild of Music Supervisors Awards for her work on the show.\nShe also served as music supervisor on Lip Sync Battle and many other shows.\n“We are devastated to hear of Robin and her dear husband, Tom’s, passing,” a representative for American Idol said in a statement. “Robin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.”\n“Robin will remain in our hearts forever, and we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time,” they added.",
