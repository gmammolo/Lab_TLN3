  "text": "Nitesh Tiwari’s highly-anticipated epic tale- Ramayana is touted as the biggest Indian film ever made. Reason? Its staggering budget, exceptional VFX and terrific star-studded cast. Film’s producer Namit Malhotra recently talked about the ambitious film and its budget. He revealed that all the production and marketing for both the installments of the film (Ramayana Part 1 and Ramayana Part 2) are done, and the costing is nothing less than staggering $500-million (Rs 4000 crore). Yes its unbelievable but true! The figure is higher than many Hollywood and Bollywood classics, naturally rising more than a few eyebrows.\nIndia’s most expensive film Interacting on The Prakhar Gupta Xperience podcast, Namit said, “When we set out to make it, 6-7 years ago, when we really got serious about mounting it, everybody called me a lunatic, because no Indian film comes close to it budgetwise. To put it simply, it will be about $500 million by the time we are done with both the films – Part 1 and Part 2, which is over Rs 4000 crore.”\nHe added, “We are making the largest film in the world for the greatest story the world should see. I still think it is cheaper than some of the big Hollywood films. I think we are making a bigger film at a lower cost. That Indian in me still believes we are not being irresponsible with money.”\nWill Ramayana soar or sink? Since the $500-million budget would mean that each of the two Ramayana films are assumed to earn $1 billion at the box office. These numbers have been scored by only global hits like Avatar, Avengers, Fast franchise etc. There is no Indian film that has ever grossed over Rs 2000 crore. In 2017, Nitesh Tiwari’s Dangal grossed Rs 2000 crore, but over Rs 1300 crore came Internationally, specifically from China. The other highest-grossing Indian films like Pushpa 2: The Rise and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion , grossed over Rs 1700 crore worldwide.\nMoreover the makers will be using strong VFX for the larger-than-life theatrical experience. If the poor execution of visual effects or storytelling occur, it can affect the viewing experience and the film might appear cheap.\nRamayana film must be handled with cultural sensitivity. If the film doesn’t resonate with the audience or capture the attention of the modern viewers, it can lead to negative views or box office disappointment.\nMore about Ramayana Ramayana stars Ranbir Kapoor as Lord Ram, Yash as Ravana, Sai Pallavi as Sita, Ravi Dubey as Lakshman, and Sunny Deol as Hanuman. Also, supporting the powerful cast is an extraordinary crew. For the first time, Music maestro AR Rahman will collaborate with the legendary Hans Zimmer, to craft a new cinematic symphony. Helmed by Nitesh Tiwari and bankrolled by Namit Malhotra’s Prime Focus Studios and Yash’s Monster Mind Creations, Ramayana Part 1 is scheduled for a release on Diwali 2026, and the second part on Diwali 2027.",
