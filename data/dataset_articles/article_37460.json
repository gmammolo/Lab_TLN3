  "text": "Representative Image BHOPAL: Two brothers, aged 9 and 6, were kidnapped and murdered in Madhya Pradesh's Seoni district. Their throats had been slit and their bodies were found in a forest 13km from their home on Wednesday afternoon. The bodies were found in the Amba Mai forest, with stones placed over and around them in an apparent attempt to conceal the crime. According to Kotwali police, Pooja Dhakriya (30), a resident of Subhash Ward, reported her sons Mayank (9) and Divyansh (6) missing on Tuesday evening. She told police that she had left for work at 5pm, leaving the boys at home. When she returned at 8pm, they were missing. After waiting till 11pm with no trace of them, she filed a complaint. Poll Should there be more community programs to protect children? Absolutely Not necessary A search operation was launched immediately. Around 2pm the next day, the children’s bodies were found in the forest. Police suspect the involvement of someone known to the family. A man, said to be an acquaintance of the children’s mother, has been detained for questioning. A dog squad and forensic team have collected evidence from the scene. Further investigation is underway.\nEnd of Article Follow Us On Social Media Tired of too many ads? go ad free now Trending Stories In City Entire Website Tired of too many ads? go ad free now",
