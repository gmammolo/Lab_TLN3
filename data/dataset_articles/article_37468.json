  "text": "More than 14,000 BC Hydro customers are without power after a storm blew through the Shuswap region on Wednesday evening.\nSicamous, Chase, Malakwa, Tappen and other nearby communities have been in the dark since about 7 p.m.\nAccording to BC Hydro, all available resources have been assigned to the outages across the Central Interior and Thompson Shuswap.\n\"All available crews are working to restore power as efficiently and safely as possible, and additional crews are being brought in from other areas,\" BC Hydro stated.\nThere is currently no estimated time of when power will be restored.\nDriveBC is warning motorists along Highway 1 in the Shuswap to travel with caution due to stop lights not working. DriveBC advises to always use the four-way stop procedure at uncontrolled intersections.\nAccording to Salmon Arm Observer journalist Heather Black, who was on Shuswap Lake earlier in the day, high winds and rain just \"suddenly hit.\"\n“We saw the veil of rain moving, so we got off the water, and then the storm hit. The wind was insane, and the rain was dumping. We hadn’t jumped in the water but were as soaked as if we had.”\nShe reported hearing that multiple emergency vehicles had been dispatched across the Shuswap.\nSeveral Shuswap residents took to social media to report down trees, scattered debris and damaged structures following the storm.\nPower outages are also being reported in the North Okanagan, affecting the communities of Ranchero, Armstrong, Grinrod and Enderby.\nMore than 2,000 BC Hydro customers are also in the dark along Highway 97 from College Way in Vernon to Oceola Road in Winfield.\nThere is no estimated time of power restoration for the North Okanagan communities affected by the outage. However, BC Hydro is reporting that crews are responding to the area.\nThe North Okanagan appears to have been impacted by the same weather system that swept through the Shuswap.\nEnvironment Canada issued a special weather statement earlier on Wednesday for strong, gusty winds across the Southern Interior.\nWind gusts of up to 70 km/hr are forecast until midnight.\n“As the upper disturbance moves through early this evening winds will shift to northwest and become strong and gusty,” stated Environment Canada.",
