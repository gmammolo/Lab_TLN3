  "text": "Badminton\nJapan Open 2025: Satwik-Chirag bow out early in second round\nThe duo of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty lost the second round match to the 5th-seeded Chinese pair.\nIndian men's doubles duo of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty had an early second-round exit at the Japan Open Super 750 Tournament in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday.\nThe former world no.1 Indian duo bowed out in straight games (22-24, 14-21) against the much higher-ranked Chinese duo of Liang Keng Wei and Wang Chang in 44 minutes.\nThis was the fourth successive defeat for Satwik-Chirag against this Chinese pair, taking their head-to-head record further down to 2-6.\nThe match kicked off with both pairs unleashing aggressive play, neither yielding an inch. After the mid-game interval, the Indian duo, Satwik-Chirag, edged ahead with a slight 18-14 lead.\nHowever, it didn't last much as the Chinese pair fought back, leveling the score to force a deuce and ultimately clinching the first game 24-22 after a fierce battle.\nThe second game followed a similar pattern, with Satwik-Chirag taking an early four-point lead, but they couldn’t hold on, allowing the Chinese duo to seize control and win 21-14, securing the match.\nMore to follow...",
