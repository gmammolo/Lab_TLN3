That worked for a while. But the real story is way more interesting than the fiction, which is why I'm finally telling it, no holds barred, in my own words.\"\nSpencer - who has been married to fellow reality star Heidi Montag since 2008 - hopes the public will now see a different side of his personality through his upcoming memoir.\nThe TV star said: \"I poured everything I have into this book, sharing all the secrets, and I couldn't be more thrilled to share it with you.\"\nThe memoir promises to reveal the \"untold truth\" behind Spencer's life.\nThe book's synopsis explains: \"Now, for the first time, Spencer reveals the untold truth behind the spectacle - a darkly comedic, unflinching and often surreal confessional from a TV villain who's finally broken character for good.\"\nMeanwhile, Heidi recently described herself as a \"trailblazer\" in the entertainment industry.\nThe 38-year-old reality star was widely criticised in 2009 after undergoing ten cosmetic surgery procedures in one day - but Heidi thinks it was \"important to be honest\" about her cosmetic surgeries.\nAsked about her act of honesty, Heidi told The Independent: \"I definitely was breaking the barrier and the fourth wall of what everyone was secretly doing in Hollywood.\n\"Part of being a trailblazer is when you are the first one to do something, you're usually the most criticised for it. That's something I can accept because I never want to be a liar; that's not the way that I'm built.\"\nHeidi doesn't have any regrets about being so honest.\nShe explained: \"I wanted to tell the story of, hey, this is what I did and what a lot of people do; to break that facade and that mirage of what's going on in Hollywood.\"\n>>\n© 2025\nBang Showbiz, NZCity\nTop Stories\nRUGBY\nThe return of experience in Tyrel Lomax and Anton Lienert-Brown to the All Blacks run-on side counters an experimental-looking starting XV for the third test against France in Hamilton\nMore...\nBUSINESS\nHigher demand for food around the world, is lifting ood prices\nMore...\nToday's News\nNews Search\nEntertainment\nNZ News\nNewsLinks\nNZ Web\nPower Search\n© 2025\nNew Zealand City Ltd",
