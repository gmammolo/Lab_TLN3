  "text": "Midnight in northwest Houston turned deadly when an unidentified man was gunned down just steps from a bus stop after leaving the WingStop on West 34th Street near the North Freeway. According to the Houston Chronicle, the victim had exited the restaurant around 12:05 a.m. Wednesday when an assailant opened fire, striking him multiple times. Despite rapid response by Houston Police Department officers, the man was pronounced dead at the scene after being rushed to a nearby hospital. Detectives recovered fifteen shell casings scattered across the sidewalk and bus-stop plaza—a grim signature of the volley of shots fired toward the victim. Detective D. Hobson of HPD Homicide confirmed investigators are seeking a dark-colored sedan believed to have sped off moments after the shooting, but no arrests have been made as of Wednesday afternoon. Local digital-content producer Ahmed Humble of KPRC 2/Click2Houston reports that witnesses at the scene described a sudden burst of gunfire, followed by panicked screams and the sound of tires peeling away from the curb. “I heard at least eight or nine rounds—I thought it was fireworks,” recalled Maria Gonzalez, a nearby convenience-store clerk who asked that only her first name be used. “When I looked outside, I saw him fall near the bus bench. There was blood everywhere.” This eyewitness account marks one of the few direct on-the-ground observations in a case still shrouded in early-morning confusion. The shooting site sits along a stretch of West 34th that residents say suffers from inadequate lighting and limited foot traffic after dark. Community advocates have long pushed for enhanced pedestrian safety measures—calls that have grown more urgent following this latest tragedy. “People shouldn’t have to worry about walking to public transit,” said neighborhood association leader Jamal Thompson. “We need better streetlights, more patrols, and cameras to deter violence.” This incident is the third fatal shooting reported in the area in just over a week, fueling frustration among those who use the bus stop nightly to commute downtown. HPD urges anyone with information—particularly motorists who observed a dark sedan in the W. 34th Street corridor between midnight and 12:15 a.m.—to contact Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS. Video surveillance from nearby businesses and Metro bus cameras is also being reviewed for leads. As the investigation continues, the community grapples with another senseless loss and demands swift action to make their streets safe once more.",
