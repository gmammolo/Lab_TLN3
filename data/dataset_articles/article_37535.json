  "text": "Robin Kaye: Grim new details following murder of American Idol executive and husband inside LA mansion\nThe Nightly\nGrim new details have surfaced following the brutal murders of an American Idol executive and her husband inside their LA mansion.\nPolice reportedly saw blood at the front entrance of Robin Kaye and Thomas Deluca’s $7.5 million property in Encino after they arrived to conduct a welfare check on Monday.\nAfter breaking a window to enter the six-bedroom home, officers discovered the couple with gunshot wounds to their heads.\nTheir bodies are believed to have been in the property for several days before police found them in separate rooms.\nLess than 24 hours later after the shocking discovery, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to TMZ that Raymond Boodarian, a 22-year-old man from Encino, was arrested in connection with the alleged murders.\nIt has since been revealed that there have been numerous break-ins and burglaries in the upscale Los Angeles neighbourhood, which catapulted talks among residents about purchasing firearms and paying private security guards to watch over their homes.\nMs Kaye and Mr Deluca, both 70, had been in contact with a security expert who revealed to the Daily Mail that the couple were planning to install an advanced security system that even included a panic room.\nGuy Cohen paid a visit to the property on May 20 and developed a plan to make the home safer after a trespasser attempted to break in only the day before.\n“An intruder came in through the sliding glass door in the kitchen. They were home and the dog started barking and she yelled and the burglar ran away,” Mr Cohen said.\nThe security expert said even though the couple didn’t have any valuables lying around the house, they wanted “more personal protection, personal safety.”\nHe recommended installing early detection equipment with an “infrared laser beam system” to detect trespassers on the property.\nHe also suggested a 24-hour surveillance system along with a panic room that would be installed in Ms Kaye’s bedroom wardrobe with walls strong enough to withstand six men pounding on it for an hour.\n“They said they were considering the proposal. They were going out of town and had some life things happening and said they would get back to me.\n“Unfortunately, it was just too late. This is something that could have been avoided.”\nMs Kaye and Mr Deluca reportedly had another handyman install sharp metal spikes along the top of their fences and driveway gate, but according to Mr Cohen, there were still some sections that hadn’t been upgraded, which could have allowed the alleged murderer to break into the property.\nMs Kaye was the music supervisor on American Idol for at least 15 seasons and won several Guild of Music Supervisors Awards for her work on the popular show.\nIn a heartbreaking statement, American Idol paid tribute to the award-winning executive, describing her as a “cornerstone” of the program.\n“We’re devastated to hear of Robin and her dear husband, Tom’s passing,” the statement read.\n“Robin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.\n“Robin will remain in our hearts forever and we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.”\nEntertainment",
