  "text": "More than a year after Eddie the Pig was killed on Maui, a second hunter is sentenced for the crime.\nBefore his sentencing, 21 year old Krys-Ryan Saito Carino issued a short apology in court, \"I'm sorry for my actions, I'm sorry.\"\nIn may of last year, his actions involved breaking into Eddie's pen at Kitty Charm Farm Sanctuary, where the 250 pound pig was a pet.\nThen Saito Carino, along with Jayden Jarnesky-Magana stabbed, then tied up and dragged off Eddie, before killing him and using the dead pet to win a feral pig hunting contest.\n\"Mr. Saito Carino, you know that having grown up as a hunter, you were not hunting that day you stole and brutally killed a pet pig. And so there has to be punishment for that to reflect the seriousness of the crime and also to promote respect for the law,\" said Judge Kirstin Hamman.\nHis attorney asked for leniency and no permanent record.\n\"He is an emerging adult. He did not make good decisions that day. He and Jayden, together chose to do what they did, and they made the wrong call,\" said Deputy Public Defender Danielle Laaana Sears.\n\"What this defendant did is inexcusable and inhumane. In conclusion, Judge, this defendant's actions, premeditation, lies, fraud and lack of humanity requires that he suffer a permanent conviction on his record,\" countered Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Mica Metter.\nSaito Carino received a stiffer sentence than his co-conspirator with five days in jail and a deferred sentence - which means he has to follow rules during four years of probation to keep the crime off his permanent record.\n\"Right now, the precedent is set that if you break onto somebody's property, destroy their property, then steal and kill their pets, and do all of the things that happened...you're going to get probation,\" said Sarah Haynes, the President of Kitty Charm Farm Sanctuary.\nHaynes, is disappointed the sentence sends a message that Hawaii is not tough on crime, especially animal crime.\n\"You know, this was pre-planned. This was a premeditated, prolonged torture of an animal. He videoed it. He put it on Instagram. This was no accident. This was no tripping across a pig out in the jungle.\nThey knew. This person's father lives bordering my property, I can see his roof from my pig pen,\" added Haynes.\nWhile this criminal case is over, Eddie the Pig may still get his day in court\n\"If I had felt the sentence was appropriate, I would not be considering a civil case,\" stated Haynes.\nYears ago, Eddie came to Kitty Charm Farm as a piglet with rope burns and scars, after supposedly being used to train hunting dogs.\nHe grew into a part of Sarah's family, even nurturing and protecting other young feral pigs who later joined the farm.\nNow Haynes would like Eddie's legacy to continue helping other pets, by re-writing our current laws so there are stronger punishments for crimes against animals.\n\"I feel so bad because I taught Eddie that humans were okay. You know, he was terrified of humans when I first got him, and I taught him that humans were okay. Then they hog tied him, stabbed him and dragged him away. He stayed alive for a long time before they killed him,\" added Haynes.",
