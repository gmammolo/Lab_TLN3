Officials said no foul play is suspected in the death of Tarrence, who went missing on June 25 while vacationing on the Caribbean island with his wife. While searching for the 52-year-old, police discovered the “body of a deceased male in a decomposed state” in the area of Grace Bay on July 5. The Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force announced Wednesday that the body was the remains of Tarrence. Police investigate ‘suspicious disappearance’ of California man linked to cryptocurrency fortune “An autopsy conducted on July 11th revealed no signs of trauma, and at this time, there is no suspicion of foul play,” the police department said in a statement. Tarrence disappeared on the third night of an anniversary getaway vacation with his wife of one year. German tourist Carolina Wilga found alive 12 days after she was lost in the Australian Outback The body was found just a short walk from the Paradise Inn in Grace Bay, where Tarrence was staying with his wife before disappearing into the night. “[The body] was found a 20-minute walk from where he was last seen,” private investigator Carl DeFazio, a former Marine and NYPD cop, told People Magazine last week. “I would say about a block off of Leeward Highway in a little residential commercial area,” DeFazio said.

Local officials have not announced a cause of death, which will be determined by a full autopsy, according to police. Tarrence was seen leaving the inn on home surveillance cameras in the early morning hours of June 25 as his wife, Maria, was asleep. The couple had moved to Manhattan last year from upstate Monroe to be close to Tarrence’s stepson, who attends college in the city.
