  "text": "Too big a story squashed into too small a shape\n'The Baby’s Room' at Galway International Arts Festival feels thinner than previous ‘Rooms’ instalments, leaving lots of gaps\nThis is the 12th year of the ‘Rooms’ project, a series of 15-minute audio plays written and directed by Enda Walsh and designed by Galway International Arts Festival’s artistic director Paul Fahy.\nThis ongoing project is something of an institution, and a curious measure of Walsh’s writing development.\nHave you tried Focail and Conundrum?\nDaily word puzzles designed to test your vocabulary and lateral thinking skills.",
