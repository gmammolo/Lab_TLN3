  "text": "The United States Embassy in India has issued a fresh advisory for visa holders after a video showing an Indian woman being arrested for alleged shoplifting in the US went viral. The embassy warned that breaking American laws could lead to immediate visa revocation and long-term travel bans.Shortly after the video drew attention online, the US Embassy in India released a message on X.The advisory read, “Committing assault, theft, or burglary in the United States won’t just cause you legal issues – it could lead to your visa being revoked and make you ineligible for future US visas. The United States values law and order and expects foreign visitors to follow all US laws.”The statement comes a day after bodycam footage went viral of an Indian tourist, identified as Avlani, being detained outside a Target store in the United States. She was accused of shoplifting merchandise worth nearly $1,000. The video, released by the YouTube channel @BodyCamEdition, shows her in conversation with law enforcement officers at the time of arrest.In the footage, Avlani is seen asking officers, “Why can’t I just pay for it?” One of the officers responds, “We’re way past that. You committed a felony.”Watch the video here The embassy’s statement also aligns with the broader enforcement direction under the Trump administration’s immigration policy. According to United Nations data, over 1.42 lakh individuals have been deported from the US since January. The administration has also tightened background checks and social media screening for visa applicants. While India is not directly affected by the recent travel bans imposed on some countries, enforcement actions have increased across visa categories.The embassy’s warning highlights the risks foreign nationals face if they are found violating US laws. Legal experts note that such incidents can result in the cancellation of valid visas and may prevent individuals from reapplying in the future.The incident has triggered discussions online regarding awareness among travelers about local laws. As of now, there is no official confirmation on the legal proceedings in the case involving Avlani.The embassy has advised all Indian nationals travelling to the United States to ensure full compliance with American laws during their stay.",
