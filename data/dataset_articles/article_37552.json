  "text": "August 21, 1935 - July 8, 2025\nMargaret (nee Donovan) Marchetti, age 89, passed away peacefully on July 8, 2025, at the Wisconsin Veterans Home in King, WI. She was born on August 21, 1935, in Mauston, Wisconsin, to William Patrick and Mary Elizabeth (Warkins) Donovan of Lyndon Station, WI.\nMargaret attended St. Mary's School in Lyndon Station and graduated from Mauston High School. Following high school, she ventured out on her own, moving first to Madison, then to Chicago, and seeking even more adventure, enlisted in the United States Army.\nShe began a meaningful career as a laboratory technologist with the U.S. Army, serving in several locations including El Paso, Texas, and Baltimore, Maryland. It was during her service that she met her future husband, Vincent Marchetti. They were married on February 7, 1959, in the Army hospital chapel in El Paso.\nMargaret was always fond of her farming roots and loved raising fruits and vegetables in her city yard gardens for her family. She enjoyed cooking, sewing, and other crafts.\nMargaret's faith was central to her life. She was known for crafting thousands of rosaries for homeless veterans and generously helping them by providing clothing, food, and prayer books — a true testament to her compassion and devotion to those who served the country. She served as the chaplain in various roles for the state and local Vets organizations for many years.\nShe also had a strong passion for public service. She served for 22 years on the Juneau County Board of Supervisors (1992-2014) and was an active member of the American Legion Post 277 in Necedah. She was deeply dedicated to teaching others about the love of Jesus and the power of prayer.\nMargaret was very proud of her Irish heritage, and never missed a chance to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Green was her favorite color.\nMargaret's legacy is one of unwavering dedication to her faith, her country, and her community. Her influence is immeasurable, and her spirit will continue to guide and inspire all who knew her.\nShe is survived by her son, Vincent (Lana) Marchetti Jr., of California; daughter, Judy (Terry) Weter of Arizona; three granddaughters; Morgan, Madison, and Ann; and siblings, Bill Donovan, Pat Donovan, Joan (Jim) McLaughlin, Colette (Bill) Hale, and Coleen Peterson. She is preceded in death by parents, husband (Vince), and brother-in-law (Pete Peterson).\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, July 18, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. at the Torkelson Funeral Home in Necedah. Burial with full military honors will follow at Queen of the Holy Rosary Mediatrix of Peace Cemetery in Necedah. Family and friends are invited for visitation from 10:00 a.m., to 11:00 a.m., on Friday at the funeral home.\nThe Torkelson Funeral Home in Necedah is assisting the family with arrangements. Online condolences may be offered at www.torkelsonfuneralhome.com\nIn lieu of flowers or any donations, the family requests you spend a few minutes on your own reflecting on the many blessings we all have each day.",
