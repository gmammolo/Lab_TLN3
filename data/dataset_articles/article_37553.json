  "text": "May 19, 1931 - July 8, 2025\nDuane Barton Weisenhaus Sr, age 94, of Mauston, WI, passed away peacefully on July 8, 2025, at his home. He earlier lived in Necedah and in the Chicago area.\nHe was born on May 19, 1931, in Warroad, MN, to the late Otto and Minnie (Ohlin) Weisenhaus. He was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather with a long and distinguished record of personal, professional and civic achievement. He is survived by his second wife, Patricia (Bartow) Weisenhaus, whom he married in 2007.\nHe was preceded in death in 1998 by his first wife, Armida (Campos) Weisenhaus. His survivors include their five children: Deborah Weisenhaus, Doreen (Gene Mustain) Weisenhaus, Darlene (Terry) Hansen, Duane Weisenhaus Jr. and Darrell Weisenhaus; as well as six grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.\nOther survivors include his sister, Marlene (Ken) Roland; three stepchildren: James Paffenroth, Kathy (Tim) Deneen and Scott (Larisa) Paffenroth; eight step-grandchildren; and 11 step-great-grandchildren.\nDuane left the small farm where he was born and moved to Chicago when he was a teenager. He graduated in 1949 from Crane Technical High School and then in 1962 obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Chicago Technical College. He worked for the Honeywell Corporation as a project engineer responsible for fire control and security systems for refineries and power plants.\nHe also served in the National Guard and US Army Reserve, achieving the rank of sergeant and qualifying as an expert marksman and instructor. He served as a member and then president of a local school board in Mundelein, IL. He also earned a pilot's license.\nAfter retiring from Honeywell, Duane pursued many interests, including photography, woodworking, birdwatching and painstakingly curating a large library of binders documenting the lives of multiple family generations.\nHe and Patricia were Master Gardeners who enjoyed traveling. They became a familiar presence at the Moose Lodge in Mauston, where both served in leadership and volunteer roles.\nDuane will be remembered by his family for building an endless legacy of family love and support that extends across all its branches and generations.\nVisitation will be Saturday, July 19, 2025 from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., followed by services at 11:00 a.m., and a military honor salute at the Bethany Lutheran Church, 701 Grove St., Mauston.
