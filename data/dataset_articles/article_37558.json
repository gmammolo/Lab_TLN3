  "text": "A group of teenagers travelled from Western Sydney to storm a southern Canberra home where the two occupants were repeatedly stabbed.\nAfter the youngest was arrested, he claimed he thought they left Sydney to go for a camping trip and was shocked and confused by what happened.\nThree 19-year-olds from the suburb of Mount Druitt – Lytrell Eneliko, Raven Pauga and Jacob Crichton – were all jailed over the violent home invasion, while a 17-year-old boy avoided being sent to prison.\nIn the early hours of 4 May 2024, they visited Hungry Jacks in Conder, before leaving behind rubbish from the fast food restaurant at a street near the home where they planned to commit the home invasion.\nEneliko carried a knife when he knocked on the door of the home, then stabbed the female resident four times in her arm and chest when she opened the door.\nThe masked offenders rushed inside yelling: “Where’s the money? Where’s the money?”.\n“There’s nothing here,” the woman screamed back.\nThe group forced the male resident onto a bed before Eneliko stabbed him in the arm and leg.\nAfter spending 10 minutes inside the home, the four fled, although Pauga jumped on the residents’ car as they left, smashing its windscreen.\nThe residents were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises over their bodies.\nDuring the investigation, police linked the DNA found on the discarded Hungry Jacks rubbish to Pauga and Crichton.\nPauga also made admissions to an undercover police officer, admitting they visited the ACT before the attack.\n“S-t went south and now this s-t is happening,” he told the undercover cop.\n“We all agreed to get it over with.\n“Too much hassle, aye.”\nPolice searched Eneliko’s home and found the knife used in the home invasion – still with blood on it.\nThe ACT Supreme Court heard the four all pleaded guilty to charges of burglary, inflicting grievous bodily harm and assault.\nEneliko blamed his involvement on being under the influence of drugs and alcohol, Pauga said he thought there would be a financial reward that he could pass on to his family, while the 17-year-old claimed he thought the group was going on a camping trip and he was shocked by what happened.\nActing Justice Rebecca Christensen SC said the victims were attacked without warning in their own home in an incident that was planned, premeditated and targeted.\nShe said the group didn’t know the victims and the motivation of the offending was not entirely clear.\nThe judge said all the offenders played a role in the violence inflicted on their victims, but Eneliko was the main offender as he stabbed the pair.\nEneliko was sentenced to five years’ jail suspended after 30 months, Pauga and Crichton were sentenced to four years’ jail suspended after 20 months, while the 17-year-old was given a fully suspended three-and-a-half year jail sentence.\nThe three adults were all arrested last year. As their sentences were backdated to take into account time in custody, Pauga can be released from February 2026, Crichton from April 2026 and Eneliko from November 2026.",
