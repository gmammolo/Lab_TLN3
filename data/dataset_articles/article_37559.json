  "text": "kadn.com\nwebsite\nJennings\nJennings mother pleads no contest to negligent homicide in hot car death of 10-month-old daughter\n1 days ago\nA Jennings mother charged with murder after her 10-month-old daughter died in a hot car entered a plea to a lesser charge. District Attorney Lauren Heinen said Hannah Cormier, 33, of Jennings, pleaded no contest to negligent homicide. Under Louisiana law, the maximum sentence for negligent homicide is 10 years, up to a $5,000 fine, or both. However, because the victim is under 10 years old, the law mandates enhanced penalties, meaning Cormier must serve at least two years of her sentence at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Judge Steve Gunnell has set a sentencing date of January 21, 2026.",
