  "text": "By PTI\nMessi's first shot came in the final minute of first-half stoppage time and landed comfortably in the arms of keeper Roman Celentano. Evander's 14th goal of the season, and 50th in MLS, put Cincinnati ahead 2-0 less than five minutes into the second half. Cincinnati (14-3-6) also had a two-goal lead on Saturday against Columbus but lost 4-2 to the Crew.",
