  "text": "Emergency teams continue searching for trapped miners following Tuesday’s catastrophic collapse at an illegal mining site in the Akwatia Constituency.\nAccording to Eastern Regional Police Command, four individuals have been extracted so far, with three fatalities confirmed and one survivor transported to St. Dominic Hospital in critical condition.\nThe disaster occurred during afternoon operations when the unsupported pit walls reportedly gave way. Local sources indicate nearby residents initiated first-response efforts before police and emergency personnel arrived. District authorities confirmed the ongoing operation faces significant challenges due to the unstable terrain and lack of proper mining infrastructure at the illegal site.\nRegional Minister Seth Kwame Acheampong visited the site Wednesday morning, pledging government support for rescue operations while condemning illegal mining activities. “This tragedy underscores why we must intensify efforts against galamsey,” he stated, referencing the Mahama administration’s ongoing campaign against unauthorized mining.\nAs excavators carefully remove debris, community volunteers maintain vigil alongside professional responders. The exact number of missing persons remains unconfirmed, with conflicting reports from local witnesses about the size of the mining crew present during the collapse.",
