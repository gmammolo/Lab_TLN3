  "text": "Fight fans aren’t happy with former UFC titleholder Tony Ferguson’s latest attempt to snap his lengthy losing skid.\nAfter parting ways with the UFC earlier this year, former interim titleholder Tony Ferguson will make his professional boxing debut under the Misfits Boxing banner.\nThe 40-year-old Ferguson will look to earn his first combat sports victory in more than six years when he faces social media influencer Salt Papi at Misfits Boxing 22 on August 30th. Ferguson and Salt Papi will battle for the MFB interim middleweight title on a card headlined by former UFC stars Darren Till and Luke Rockhold .\nAs Ferguson begins this new chapter of his fighting career, fight fans aren’t happy with his decision to continue competing.\nREAD MORE: Calvin Kattar hits back at growing calls to retire following fifth consecutive loss at UFC Nashville Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images Tony Ferguson vs. Salt Papi draws harsh reviews after Misfits announcement Ferguson lost each of his final eight UFC fights, including his most-recent defeat to Michael Chiesa at UFC Abu Dhabi last August. His current skid began with a lopsided defeat to Justin Gaethje for the UFC’s interim lightweight belt at UFC 249.\nDuring his ongoing losing streak, Ferguson has taken a lot of damage, including in a front-kick knockout defeat to Michael Chandler at UFC 274. Ferguson, one of the biggest fan favorites in UFC history, is hearing from some of his most devoted fans after his return fight was announced this week.\nFans took to social media to express their displeasure in Ferguson’s latest comeback attempt.\n“That’s so sad Tony please don’t agree to that joke. You were a great!!!” one fan wrote on X .\n“WTF are we doing?” another said.\n“Misfits is really down bad huh?”\n“What a weird world we live in.”\n“Depressing”\n“Well…it’s been nice knowing Ferguson.”\n“Tony is fighting something called ‘Salt Papi’. What have we become?”\n“Former UFC star fighting a Tiktoker on Misfits holy hell Tony gotta hang it up.”\n“Tony Ferguson getting colded by Salt Papi.”\n“I don’t even wanna think about it but if Tony loses…”\n“Dude this is so bad.”\n“Tony and Luke [Rockhold] have no business being in a boxing ring.”\nFerguson hasn’t won since defeating Donald Cerrone by doctor’s stoppage at UFC 238. His current losing skid was preceded by 12 consecutive wins, including victories over former titleholders Anthony Pettis and Rafael dos Anjos .\nFerguson was linked to an MMA fight with Dillon Danis under the now-defunct Global Fighting League banner before the bout was canceled. Danis and Ferguson could still potentially square off in Misfits Boxing if Ferguson is victorious in his return.\nREAD MORE: Dustin Poirier reacts to Joe Rogan’s shock absence for UFC 318 post-fight sendoff Luke Rockhold returns against Darren Till in pro boxing debut Meanwhile, Rockhold and Till headline in an intriguing matchup at Misfits Boxing 22. Rockhold returns to combat sports after knocking out kickboxing standout Joe Schilling at Karate Combat 45 last year.\nRockhold has had mixed results since parting ways with the UFC following a loss to Paulo Costa at UFC 278. He lost to Mike Perry at Bare Knuckle FC 41 after quitting midway through the second round.\nRockhold and Till will fight for the MFB bridgerweight title.\nREAD MORE: ‘I won’t have that burden’… Dustin Poirier tells hilarious story when reflecting on things he won’t miss in retirement",
