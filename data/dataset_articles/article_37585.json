  "text": "In the ongoing five-match Test series in England, India have lost two games that they should have won. Shubman Gill and Co. allowed England to chase down 371 in the first Test, and then failed to chase 193 in the third Test at Lord’s - handing the hosts a 2-1 lead in the series.\nJasprit Bumrah featured in both of those defeats. Interestingly, the one Test he missed - the second in Birmingham - saw India register a record 336-run victory. Prior to the series, Bumrah had informed the team management that he would play only three of the five Tests to manage his workload.\nIndia must win the fourth Test in Manchester, starting on July 23, to keep the series alive. While it seems ideal for Bumrah to play this all-important encounter, former England cricketer David Lloyd believes that playing the fourth Test could force the Indian management to also push him into the fifth if the series gets leveled in Manchester.\nSpeaking to TalkSport Cricket, Lloyd said: \"It is what they've said and what coach Gautam Gambhir said - that he will play three out of the five Tests. So, he's got a choice. There are two matches to go. He's played two. If they are true to their words, he should play this next game at Old Trafford. But then, you know, they can manoeuvre that, can't they?\n\"If he plays this next one at Old Trafford and they get a result to make it 2-2, you'd think he'd play at The Oval as well. I'm second-guessing, but I think he'll play this next game and see where they are. If England go 3-1, he won't play. But if it's 2-2, he will play at The Oval.\"\nSince his debut, Bumrah has featured in 47 Tests, with India recording 20 wins and 23 losses in those games. During the same period, he has missed 27 Tests - India have won 19, lost just five, and drawn three of those matches.\nEven in the second Test at Birmingham, India’s pace unit stepped up in his absence, with Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep taking 17 wickets between them.\n\"That's extraordinary. There was something that said when he plays they lose more than when he doesn't play, and he is like the best bowler in the world. And he is awkward and nasty with his action, but a thoroughly decent fella,\" Lloyd added.",
