  "text": "( KRON ) — The victim in Tuesday evening’s deadly crash on Highway 84 has been identified by the Alameda County Coroner’s Office. Ryan Joshua Aquino Amigable, a 21-year-old Oakley resident, was driving on Highway 84 near Livermore at around 6:19 p.m. when a Lexus lost control and crashed into his Honda sedan head-on. Amigable, according to his family, was driving home on his way from work. Amid the “sudden tragic event,” Amigable’s family has started a GoFundMe in their time of need. As of Wednesday night, it has raised more than $10,000. According to Amigable’s family, bystanders of the crash were not able to help him “due to him being pinned in and unable to remove the door.” The fatal crash caused the highway to be shut down for several hours. Amigable is survived by his mother, father, stepfather, stepmother, six younger siblings and grandparents. “Ryan is a loving big brother and son,” the GoFund. Ryan was a good person and the best big brother to Aliyah, Sabrina, Sofia, Raiden, Krilianna, and Jianna,” the GoFundMe writes. “He never wanted to go out so he could be safe at home. All he did was work, stay home, and spend his time in his room posing his action figures, which was his hobby and he loved doing it.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KRON4.",
