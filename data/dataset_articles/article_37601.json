  "text": "Kylian Mbappé’s debut season at Real Madrid was nothing short of spectacular on an individual level but in a sport where collective triumph defines legacy, the French superstar has reason to feel frustrated.\nMbappé netted an incredible 44 goals in 56 matches across all competitions during the 2024/25 season, including 31 in La Liga, earning him both the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Shoe. He broke Ivan Zamorano’s record for most goals in a debut season at Real Madrid and became just the fourth player in club history to score 30+ goals in his first La Liga campaign, joining legends Alfredo Di Stéfano, Hugo Sánchez, and Ruud van Nistelrooy.\nHe even made history in Europe, scoring a hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League knockout stages and reaching 50 Champions League goals becoming the second-youngest to do so after Lionel Messi.\nA Season Without Silverware\nDespite Mbappé’s individual brilliance, Real Madrid failed to claim any of the season’s major trophies. They were eliminated in the Champions League and missed out on both La Liga and the Copa del Rey, settling only for minor honors: the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup. It marked the club’s first season since 2010 without a major title.\nThe club’s struggles led to the departure of head coach Carlo Ancelotti in May, despite his status as the most decorated manager in Real Madrid history. Xabi Alonso took over, but Real Mandrid’s fortunes didn’t improve, suffering a disappointing exit at the hands of PSG in the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals.\nToo Much Mbappé?\nThe stark contrast between Mbappé’s personal form and Real Madrid’s team failures has sparked debate. While he dazzled with goals, critics argue Real became too reliant on him, disrupting the balance of an already star-studded attack featuring Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham.\nReports suggest that the lack of defensive contribution from both Mbappé and Vinícius—especially in high-stakes games exposed Real to tactical vulnerabilities. In the modern era where pressing from the front is key, Real’s inability to adapt left them trailing tactically.\nWhile Mbappé has solidified his status as one of football’s elite, Real Madrid’s trophyless season underscores a vital truth: even generational talents can’t carry a team alone. At 26, Mbappé has time on his side—and if Real Madrid can align individual stardom with team structure, the coming seasons could turn near-misses into triumphs.",
