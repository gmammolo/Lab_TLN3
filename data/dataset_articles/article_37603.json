  "text": "A new report from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reveals that three guests were hospitalized for at least 24 hours after visiting Universal’s newest theme park.\nTo say that Epic Universe has gone down well with guests would be an understatement. Universal Orlando Resort’s newest theme park has received rave reviews for its immersive lands, with Dark Universe, SUPER NINTENDO WORLD, Celestial Park, How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk , and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic all appealing to guests for their own unique reasons.\nCredit: Andrew Boardwine, ITM\nHowever, like all theme parks, it’s not totally without its problems. As per the latest report from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services , three people have been hospitalized after visiting the brand-new theme park in the second quarter of 2025.\nAccidents Reported at Epic Universe Before the theme park ever officially opened , an incident occurred on Hiccup’s Wing Gliders – the launch coaster that serves as the centerpiece of Isle of Berk – on May 5, with a 32-year-old man experiencing chest pain during Epic Universe’s previews.\nCredit: Universal\nTwo guests apparently reportedly experienced a “dizziness/altered state of consciousness” and “visual disturbance/numbness” after riding the thrill ride. The guests in question were a 63-year-old man and a 47-year-old woman.\nDisney World and SeaWorld Also Report Incidents Epic Universe isn’t the only theme park to report incidents from April through June.\nUniversal’s other theme parks also experienced issues. A 72-year-old woman felt weak and dizzy while riding the simulator Jimmy Fallon’s Race Through New York at Universal Studios Florida. Meanwhile, a 77-year-old man felt chest pain while riding the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal’s Islands of Adventure.\nCredit: Universal\nAt Walt Disney World Resort, an 87-year-old woman with a preexisting condition passed out while riding DINOSAUR at Disney’s Animal Kingdom – one of the final relics of DinoLand U.S.A. before the land’s final hurrah to make way for Tropical Americas . A 76-year-old woman fell while getting off Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin at the Magic Kingdom and hurt her right leg.\nOver at SeaWorld Orlando, a 78-year-old woman fell unresponsive riding the carousel, and a 24-year-old woman “experienced a medical condition” on the marine theme park’s Infinity Falls, a river raft ride with a 40-foot waterfall drop.\nHave you ever experienced an incident at a theme park?",
