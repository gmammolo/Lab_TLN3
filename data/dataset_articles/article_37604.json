  "text": "Multiple “grown men” recently fought over getting splashed with water on Magic Kingdom Park ’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride. According to a video of the incident, the fight began because a Walt Disney World Resort guest used his water bottle to splash other guests on board the Adventureland attraction.\nOn July 12, a Walt Disney World Resort guest named Jennalynn (@jennalynnmj) shared footage of the fight on TikTok. “POV: You get off pirates at MK and two grown men start arguing over water.”\n@jennalynnmj On a 100° day somebody could splash me with water all they want #wdw #magickingdom #disneyworld #disney #piratesofthecaribbean #fight #waltdisneyworld\n♬ original sound – Jennalynn\nThe video begins with three men arguing in the gift shop at the Pirates of the Caribbean exit. The man accused of splashing riders with his water bottle admonishes the other two guests for not acting like “adults.”\n“This is Disney World, not your world!” one of the men yells back.\nCredit: Disney\nThen, the men split up. A woman can be heard screaming, “HELP!”, and the man with the water bottle approaches a Disney cast member to point out the party involved. After he walks away, one of the men from the beginning of the video and a woman (possibly the same one who yelled for help) tell the confused cast member that the man took his full water bottle and spun it around, splashing everyone on the ride.\nWhen the couple realizes Jennalynn is recording, they’re not happy.\n“Oh good, you’re recording, good job, guys,” the man says, sarcastically giving a thumbs up.\nCredit: Ed Aguila, Inside the Magic\n“This is my cheap entertainment,” Jennalynn responds.\nAs more Disney cast members approach, Jennalynn interjects to tell them that the man beside her “started the argument.” “Neither party handled it well,” someone nearby added.\n“Don’t worry,” the Disney cast member replies. “Relax.”\nCredit: Inside the Magic\nJennalynn didn’t understand the problem: “On a 100° day somebody could splash me with water all they want.”\nDisney Parks fans were divided in the comments. Some agreed with Jennalynn.\n“They’re going after that cast member complaining like petulant children.. that CM who has to wear THAT COSTUME (iykyk) in an open air/barely any ceiling store in 100 degree weather.. those socks alone are insufferable any time a year, especially summer,” @squeezibean commented.\nCredit: Disney Dining\n“They know they get wet ON that ride, right?” @magicalbumblebri asked.\nOthers said they would’ve responded similarly if someone had splashed them.\n“I don’t want some random person throwing water or whatever he wants on me,” @d379pr argued.\nCredit: Disney\n“Okay but I’d be s mad if someone sprayed their water bottle on me they had every right to call him out,” @hannah_backwards9 agreed. “Who does that? Especially with the price of those smart waters.”\nStill, some Walt Disney World Resort fans felt that everyone involved in the fight could have handled the situation better.\n“Too many people and a bunch of foolery,” @nicosabuco wrote.\nCredit: Disney\n“Please ban all of them,” @mrcoache replied.\nThis is just one of many controversies surrounding Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Public debate began in the late 2010s, when Walt Disney Imagineers replaced animatronic brides-for-auction with independent female pirates. Some Disney Parks fans agreed with the inclusive change; others felt it was sanitizing the realities of piracy. Still, another contingent of Disney Park guests said Imagineering didn’t go far enough.\nIn 2023, a TikToker user amassed widespread attention online after posting a video expressing her discomfort with the male pirate animatronics.\nCredit: Disney\n“I just think this is kind of a weird ride,” the Disney Park guest said. “I don’t know… It’s just a little bit rapey.”\nUnsurprisingly, the video garnered a lot of backlash. Still, some other women agreed with the TikToker’s take.\n“It feels like we’re the entertainment for them and I do not like it,” one user commented.\nCredit: Steve Wise, Flickr\n“I always felt violated on this ride,” said another.\nDespite the continued public debate, Walt Disney Imagineering has not announced plans for further Pirates of the Caribbean updates. However, a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed, family-friendly lounge called The Beak and Barrel is scheduled to debut in Adventureland at Magic Kingdom Park later this year.\nWhat’s the wildest thing you’ve seen another guest do at Magic Kingdom Park, EPCOT, Disney’s Hollywood Studios, or Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park?
