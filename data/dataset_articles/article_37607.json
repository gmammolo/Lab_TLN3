  "title": "The mysterious death of paranormal investigator Dan Rivera during 'Devils on the Run' tour with 'Possessed' Annabelle doll - The Economic Times",
  "text": "Dan Rivera, a 54-year-old paranormal investigator and U.S. Army veteran, died under mysterious circumstances on Sunday, July 13, 2025, while on tour with the infamous Annabelle doll in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Rivera, a lead investigator with the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), was staying at a local hotel during his “Devils on the Run” tour when emergency responders were called to the scene. Despite CPR efforts, he was pronounced dead at the hotel. His cause of death remains unknown. 121396523 Rivera was a well-known figure in the paranormal community, having appeared on various supernatural television programs and serving as a consulting producer for Netflix’s 28 Days Haunted. His latest tour, which featured the notorious Annabelle doll—believed by many to be demonically possessed—had just wrapped up a sold-out, three-day stop at Gettysburg’s historic Soldiers National Orphanage, hosted by Ghostly Images of Gettysburg Tours. Rivera’s death was confirmed by both NESPR and the tour organizers. The society paid tribute to him in a Facebook post on Monday, July 14, saying: “We are heartbroken and still processing this loss. Dan truly believed in sharing his experiences and educating people on the paranormal. His kindness and passion touched everyone who knew him. Thank you for your support and kind thoughts during this difficult time.” Fellow paranormal investigator Ryan Buell also shared an emotional tribute on TikTok: “I have so many amazing memories with this guy. Just two months ago, we were traveling across the country introducing a new generation to Ed and Lorraine Warren’s legacy.” Rivera was active on social media, particularly TikTok, where he regularly shared behind-the-scenes footage and stories from his investigations. He was instrumental in bringing renewed attention to the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the founders of NESPR, whose real-life cases inspired The Conjuring film franchise.All about Annabelle doll The Annabelle doll, a Raggedy Ann toy, became infamous in the 1970s after being linked to a series of paranormal disturbances. According to NESPR, the doll was originally gifted to a student nurse in 1968. Soon after, she and her roommate reportedly experienced strange and violent phenomena involving the doll. A medium told them it was inhabited by the spirit of a young girl named Annabelle—but the encounters grew more malevolent. The Warrens concluded the doll was not haunted by a child’s spirit, but rather possessed by an evil entity, and they later sealed it in a glass case at their Connecticut occult museum for public safety. Following the deaths of Ed in 2006 and Lorraine in 2019, their daughter Judy and son-in-law Tony Spera took over NESPR and its infamous museum, which has been closed to the public since 2019 due to zoning issues. The Adams County Coroner’s Office has yet to release Rivera’s cause of death.",
