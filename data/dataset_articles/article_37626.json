  "text": "SINGAPORE: A woman took to social media to share that she is starting over at 34 after her soon-to-be ex-husband allegedly took most of her money during their marriage.\nPosting on the r/singaporefi forum on Wednesday (July 16), the woman revealed that she and her husband have two children, and she is now filing for divorce for “many reasons,” including financial abuse.\nShe explained that she had been trying to support his business financially, but her husband took the help for granted and kept demanding more money. Eventually, he began “threatening” her when she hesitated to give in to his requests.\n“I left the house with just S$2k in cash,” she shared. “It was so devastating, but I guess it will be a good start again.”\nThe woman, who now works as a freelance tutor earning between S$3.5k and\nS$4k a month, said she’s trying to rebuild her life from scratch.\nShe also asked others in the community if they had any advice for her, writing: “Anyone with similar experience care to share what you’ve done to start over? I’ve been wondering if I need to upskill myself, too. I think I’ve been so isolated from the real world for so long during my marriage.”\n“We need the fire to show our children that Mum is strong and we can survive.”\nAfter reading the woman’s plea for help, many Singaporean Reddit users chimed in to offer words of comfort and advice.\nOne user commented, “Sorry to hear that. But increasing your income is your main priority right now. There is always a rainbow after the rain, and please do not despair. I know it is easy to say this, but you gotta stay strong for yourself and for your two children. They need you.”\nAnother wrote, “Sorry to hear that. I hope he’s not abusive (physical violence) otherwise, do get court protection. Get support from family members if they can help to tide over this tough period.\nThey continued, “You have done the right thing. Things will only get better the moment you muster the courage to step out of a toxic relationship and environment. Continue doing what you are good at; switch out tutoring if it is no longer sustainable. Try group tuition at lower fees if parents are ok.”\nA third user, who coincidentally is the same age and going through the same situation as the woman, said: “It’s okay to start over. Single mothers are quite resilient, and age does not matter. We need the fire to show our children that Mummy is strong and we can survive.”\nShe added, “You can try to explore career conversion programmes too under WSG and see which one piques your interest. All the best.”\nIn other news, a 25-year-old jobseeker was left unsettled after being repeatedly asked about her marital status during a virtual interview with a multinational corporation (MNC).\nOn Tuesday (July 15), the woman took to the r/askSingapore Reddit forum to share her experience and seek advice.\nAccording to her post, the interview was conducted virtually and one-on-one with a middle-aged manager from the department she had applied to, rather than a representative from human resources.\nRead more: ‘Are you single?’: Female jobseeker disturbed by personal questions on marital status during job interview\nSee also Man disheartened after his long-lost friends wanted to \"catch up\" with him just to ask for money since he started a business\nFeatured image by freepik (for illustration purposes only)",
