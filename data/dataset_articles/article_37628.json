  "text": "An 18-year-old man died on Wednesday allegedly after a joyride reportedly collapsed at Nicco Park, a popular amusement park in the city, triggering panic among visitors.\nThe deceased, identified as Rahul, a resident of Muraripukur in the Ultadanga area, had arrived at the park with a group of friends around 11 a.m, police said. Witnesses reported that Rahul was on a ride when the structure malfunctioned, causing him to fall from a height along with a swing-like seat. He sustained severe head injuries and was rushed to a private hospital in Salt Lake, where doctors declared him dead.\nAccording to sources, Rahul died before reaching the hospital. The Bidhannagar South police have launched an investigation into the incident and are questioning his friends to ascertain the sequence of events. Authorities have yet to confirm the exact cause of the mechanical failure. The incident caused widespread panic at the amusement park, which was crowded with visitors at the time.\nThis is not the first time Nicco Park has faced scrutiny over ride safety. In 2012, a similar accident injured 17 people after a ride collapsed, prompting concerns over park operations.",
