  "text": "Starmer said those who didn’t like his neo-Thatcherism could leave – and they have Keir Starmer is set, not just to lose the next general election but to lose his Holborn and St Pancras (HSP) parliamentary seat – booted out of Parliament altogether. But not to an existing political party, despite Labour collapsing to the far-right Reform UK ‘party’ in many areas because of Starmer’s lurch to the far, far right, his collaboration in Israel’s Gaza genocide and his war on the rights and freedoms of British people to protect Israel.\nNo, ‘Starver’ Starmer is on court to lose his seat… to the ‘Jeremy Corbyn party’ that doesn’t even exist yet.\nJust the prospect of a Corbyn-led party is sufficient to generate enough support among a (‘red’-) austerity-sickened and hope-starved public to turf Starmer out on his ear, onto the scrapheap he deserves, according to the latest polling by Findoutnow , which included a prospective Corbyn party among the voting options:\nStarmer’s pitch has always been that his faction represents ‘the grown-ups in the room’, but the reality has always been that they more closely resemble a pack of small-minded, short, vindictive, malignant, grasping and heartless ogres – particularly incompetent and unlikeable ones. When he took over the party, he notoriously said that those who didn’t like his hard-right policies and support for Zionism could leave. They clearly have.\nCorbyn’s party has a clear lead in HSP and doesn’t even exist yet. Even the prospect of real hope is enough to blow them out of the water – and Starmer betraying the people and refusing to provide it has only emboldened and enabled the UK fascists just as he has the genocidal ones in Israel.\nPlease remember to support Skwawkbox if you can, to help ensure it can keep running.
