  "text": "Ex-MSNBC host Tiffany Cross doesn’t care that she’s minimizing the true horror of the Holocaust by comparing air-conditioned illegal alien detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps. She keeps pushing the fake equivalence despite neither being remotely the same thing. Republican commentator Scott Jennings even told her how insulting she was, but it was to no avail.\nSee and hear for yourself. (WATCH)\nScott Jennings and Tiffany Cross battle over her comparison of ICE detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps.\n— Thomas Hern (@ThomasMHern)\n\"That's offensive to Jewish people, by the way. Every time you say that, I get a thousand texts. Comparing that to the Holocaust is WILD.\"[pic.twitter.com/HMPjX4HA3v][July 16, 2025]\nHer ignorance could not be contained.\nEven Jennings appears to have reached the end of his rope with Cross.\nScott Jennings is over it.\n— The Undercurrent (@NotTheirScript)[pic.twitter.com/1vnfI54lnU][July 16, 2025]\nI think Tiffany Cross finally found Scott's limit.\n— Thomas Hern (@ThomasMHern)\nComparing ICE facilities to Nazi concentration camps.\nNot sure how anyone can think being given three meals a day, beds, showers, and transportation to their home country is comparable to Nazi concentration camps.[July 16, 2025]\nHe tolerates a lot more than I think I could.\n— The Undercurrent (@NotTheirScript)[July 16, 2025]\nYou could tell her stupidity was affecting him physically, which is saying something since his tolerance levels would be off the charts doing these panel shows several nights a week.\nPosters drive home that places like Alligator Alcatraz are nothing like concentration camps.\nWrong. Nazis permanently imprisoned German CITIZENS based solely on RACE/RELIGION. They wouldn’t LET them leave the country. Enslaved them and killed them. Trump is temporarily detaining ALIENS based on ILLEGAL status. He is HELPING them leave. No one is being enslaved or killed.\n— Selene (@agravematter)[pic.twitter.com/3WSYeNyIV3][July 16, 2025]\nHow intellectually dishonest can you get?\n— Dean (@digitaldean)\nSo is ICE rounding up and then k!lling anyone.\nNo.\nEveryone they are arresting, detaining and deporting are illegal aliens.\nThis isn’t some genocide or ethnic cleansing\nGet a grip and take off your tinfoil hat[July 16, 2025]\nThey don't believe it themselves. It's just their old tactic of calling everything they don't like a nazi.\n— Chem (@c_h_e_m)\nThat worked for a while a decade ago but people are now fed up with up and see trough their charade.[July 16, 2025]\nSent back to your own country > being burned alive\n— JeffHart (@JeffHart24)\nIn the end, its all about the census and Congressional seats.[July 16, 2025]\nCorrect. All the histrionics over illegal aliens are about ending all deportations so Democrats can continue to inflate census numbers and not lose congressional seats or Electoral College votes. It's about power for them.\nEditor’s Note: Democrat politicians and their radical supporters will do everything they can to interfere with and threaten ICE agents enforcing our immigration laws.\nHelp us hold these leftists accountable and expose their obstruction.
