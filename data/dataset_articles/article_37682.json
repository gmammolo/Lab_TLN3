  "text": "The legal actions are coming in fast with Jane’s Addiction.\nMembers of the influential alt-rock band on Wednesday sued their former lead singer, Perry Farrell, after a fight broke out between Farrell and guitarist Dave Navarro during a show in September, The Guardian reports.\nIn response, Farrell, 66, filed a legal complaint against the band, claiming he was the victim of the incident, Variety reports.\nAccording to Deadline, Navarro, 58, the band’s guitarist, bassist Eric Avery and drummer Stephen Perkins sued Farrell for $10 million Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The lawsuit accuses Farrell of a “brutal and unprovoked” onstage attack on Navarro.\nThe lawsuit says the incident led to the canceling several tour dates and the loss of millions of dollars, Deadline reports.\nThe incident occurred during a Jane’s Addiction show in Boston. Reports say Farrell attacked Navarro as the song “Ocean” came to an end. Video reportedly shows Farrell intentionally shoulder-bumping Navarro, then yelling and pushing toward the guitarist. Navarro tried to hold him back, but Farrell threw a punch across Navarro’s chest.\nThe band’s crew members rush onto the stage and, along with bassist Eric Avery, restrain Farrell, who struggles with them before finally being escorted away.\nFarrell’s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said in a post on Instagram after the incident that “Clearly there had been a lot of tension and animosity between the members.”\n“Perry’s frustration had been mounting, night after night, he felt that the stage volume had been extremely loud and his voice was being drowned out by the band,” Etty Lau wrote. “Perry had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat every night. But when the audience in the first row started complaining up to Perry, cussing at him that the band was (playing) too loud and that they couldn’t hear him, Perry lost it.”\nDeadline reports Farrell’s legal motion accuses Navarro playing loudly during the concert in Chicago as part of “a longstanding pattern of harassment and bullying [Farrell] has suffered at the hands of the other members of the band, and the various passive aggressive, or sometimes just aggressive ‘tricks’ they would use to undermine his performances on stage.”\nThe motion accuses Navarro of attacking Farrell and his wife backstage following the show. Farrell also says he was given no say in ending the tour.\n“This is yet another clear example of the group uniting to isolate and bully frontman Perry Farrell,” a representative of Farrell said in a statement to People Magazine. “The timing of this baseless lawsuit is no coincidence — it was filed only after they caught wind of legal action coming from our side. It’s a transparent attempt to control the narrative and present themselves as the so-called ‘good guys’ — a move that’s both typical and predictable.\"",
