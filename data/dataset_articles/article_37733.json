Sadly, Mr. Childers was caught in the rip current, as well. He died trying to save others.”\nChase Childers. gofundme\nThe Georgetown County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday that their deputies “participated in the recovery of a body from the ocean today after a swimmer in distress was reported just after 5 p.m.”\nBystanders were unsuccessful in their efforts to save him before first responders arrived.\nChilders was a former professional baseball player, spending 2009 and 2010 in the Baltimore Orioles farm system. After retiring from the sport, he worked as a Cobb County police officer and received a lifetime achievement award for saving lives, per a GoFundMe established to help his family.\n\"We are devastated by the tragic loss of our beloved Chase,\" GoFundMe organizer Jordan Wicker said. \"It feels surreal, incredibly hard to grasp, and profoundly unfair.”\nThe post contained a photo of Childers standing outdoors for a professional family photoshoot.\n“Chase was a truly selfless individual, always prioritizing the safety of others above his own,\" his family said in a statement to WCDB . \"Without hesitation, he would leap into action whenever someone was in need, ready to tackle any challenge that came his way. To his family and all who knew him, he will forever be remembered as a hero.”\nChase Childers. gofundme\nLaw enforcement officials said this has been the fifth drowning on Pawleys Island since June 2023 and the second in the past month, the news station reported.\n“The Town is saddened by the report of the drowning over the weekend.
