  "text": "Wallabies Face British & Irish Lions Without Star Player Valetini\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt expressed confidence in Nick Champion de Crespigny's potential impact during his test debut for the first clash against the British & Irish Lions, despite key player Rob Valetini's injury-related absence. Scrumhalf Jake Gordon and newcomer Tom Lynagh are set to feature prominently as the team rearranges its lineup.\nWallabies coach Joe Schmidt has acknowledged the setback of missing key player Rob Valetini for the opening test against the British & Irish Lions. However, Schmidt is optimistic that flanker Nick Champion de Crespigny will deliver a strong performance in his debut at Lang Park on Saturday.\nValetini, celebrated as Australia's top test player for two consecutive years, will sit out yet another match due to a calf injury, alongside Will Skelton. Schmidt indicated the pair were nearing fitness and might have played if it were the series finale.\nReplacements include loose forward Langi Gleeson's available slot now filled by Champion de Crespigny, who returned from France. Meanwhile, Jake Gordon's comeback post-hamstring injury teams him with Tom Lynagh, stepping in for the injured Noah Lolesio. With a revamped lineup, the Wallabies are poised for their weekend clash.",
