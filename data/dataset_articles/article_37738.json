  "text": "Pioneering news presenter Penny Spence, one of the first women to read television news in Australia, has died.\nSpence spent her career as a presenter at Nine then producer of Children’s Television.\nWhen Brian Henderson was reading the evening news, Spence presented the afternoon bulletin for Nine in NSW in the early-mid 1970s. Before that, she hosted a women’s current affairs program on TCN9, presented the weather, and was twice awarded a Logie for Most Popular Female Personality in NSW (1969 and 1972).\nShe later became a key figure behind the scenes, leading children’s programming at the Nine Network and serving as Executive Producer of the European Broadcasting Union’s children’s unit. Her work as a producer is represented in the national Film & Sound Archive collection, including The Water Trolley (1988), which was nominated for an International Emmy , along with Shipmates (1987), Sovereign Hill (1990), and Hinkler: The Aviator (1990).\nNine veteran Richard Lyle recalls, “She had started at TCN 9 as on air presenter, some time weather girl and worked with Desmond Tester of the first of TCN9’s kids tv show Desmond Tester and the Channel Ninepins with a segment called the Cabbage Quiz (the first show I was ever on, as an audience member).\n“She was also known – all over Sydney – as the presenter that would appear every night just before or after the news to tell people about the evening’s highlights on Nine, making every show sound like one you just had to watch!\n“While at Nine, she met a married Bandleader and mad-cap funster Geoff Harvey and they had two daughters, Eugenie and Charlotte, and for a number of years lived nearby in Epping.\n“Because of her connection with children’s television, she was Nine’s representative in the formative years of the Australian Children’s Television Foundation which worked in the funding of shows especially for children. She also worked behind the scenes as a program adviser / purchaser of noteworthy overseas children’s programs from the UK and the USA.”\nShe is pictured above holding an award with fellow producer Jim Badger, for the children’s show Colour in the Creek (1985).\nSource: NFSA",
