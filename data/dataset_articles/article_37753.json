  "text": "LARCHWOOD — Class 2A No. 3 West Lyon won 3-1 over No. 9 Hinton in a regional final contest Monday.\n“We took the No. 3 team in the state to the last out,” Hinton head coach Jennifer Jacobs-List said. “Defensively, we played pretty solid against a team that is known for dominating their opponents. Offensively, we left 10 people on base, which is disappointing, but also speaks to our chances. We were right in this game the whole time.”\nAfter a 1-2-3 first inning, the Blackhawks got runners aboard after that, but could not push them around. Kaydence Smith reached on a base hit in the second inning while Addie Dunkel and Kayla Sypersma reached on hits in the third inning and moved up to second and third base, but were left stranded. The Blackhawks again got runners to second and third in the fourth inning, but could not score. A runner reached third base in the fifth but was left stranded. Hinton went down in order in the sixth before finally scoring a run in the seventh. Becca Lahrs came home as Sypersma picked up the RBI. Sypersma had the only multi-hit game for the Blackhawks.\nJersey Hawf drove in all three runs for West Lyon, two on a hit in the third inning and another in the sixth inning with a bases-loaded walk.\nThe three runs were charged to Sypersma, with two runs earned. Sypersma took the loss with two strikeouts in six innings. Hawf tossed the win for the Wildcats with six strikeouts in seven innings.\nHinton had two seniors on the roster, Ava Lang and Natalie Nelson.\n“We had two great senior leaders who modeled the right way to play Hinton softball,” Jacobs-List said. “They brought positive attitudes and efforts every day and were a joy to be around.”\nThe Blackhawks finished the season with a record of 19-6 while making their deepest postseason run in several years after losing in their first regional game the previous two seasons. The team was searching for its first state tournament appearance since 2010.\n“For the first time in sometime, we came to play this postseason,” Jacobs-List said. “Overall, this was a huge step forward for us as a program and should help push us to want to work more this offseason.”\nWest Lyon (28-1) will be the No. 3 seed in the Class 2A state tournament bracket as the school earns its fourth appearance at state in the sport and first since 2004. The Wildcats will face No. 6-seeded Cascade (20-9) in the state quarterfinals on July 22.",
