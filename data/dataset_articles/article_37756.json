  "text": "FOX5 Investigates Scam Alert: Monsoon and fire season bring fake contractors calling\nLAS VEGAS (FOX5) — It’s monsoon and fire season here in southern Nevada, and with the change in season comes a change in tactics for scammers. The Nevada Contractors Board is raising a red flag on some of them.\nBeware of door-to-door solicitors pushing contracts for repairs or upgrades. Oftentimes, they’re unlicensed and uninsured. Also, watch out for high-pressure pitches. You should never be intimidated into signing a contract. Walk away from aggressive salespeople, and call the police if you ever feel threatened.\nThe Board says demands for up-front, or cash payments, should also raise suspicions. Both are an easy way for a fake contractor to walk away with your money without doing any work. Whenever possible, pay by check or with a credit card. Credit cards offer the highest level of fraud protection.\nVisit the Nevada Contractors Board website to easily verify a contractor’s license or to file a complaint against someone who’s worked on your home.\nCopyright 2025 KVVU.
