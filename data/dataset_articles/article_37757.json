  "text": "Navi Mumbai To Face 18-Hour Water Cut On July 18 For Pipeline Repair\nAffected areas under NMMC jurisdiction include Airoli, Belapur, Nerul, Koparkhairane, Turbhe, Sanpada, Ghansoli and Vashi.\nThe Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has announced an 18-hour water supply disruption in Navi Mumbai starting Friday, July 18. This disruption is necessary to carry out essential repair and connection work on the Morbe main water pipeline. As per the NMMC’s announcement, the work is scheduled to commence from 10 AM on Friday, July 18, to 4 AM on Saturday, July 19.\nThe work involves linking a newly laid pipeline to the existing 1700 mm diameter Morbe pipeline, which supplies drinking water to large parts of Navi Mumbai. The affected stretch runs along Palm Beach Road in Nerul Sector 46, near Akshar Building.\nRecommended Stories\nThis stretch has experienced multiple leakages in recent months, leading to water loss and disruptions. To address the issue, the NMMC laid a new pipeline alongside the existing one. Now, they have decided to connect the two.\nAs a result, the water supply will impact several key areas in Navi Mumbai. Affected areas under NMMC jurisdiction include Airoli, Belapur, Nerul, Koparkhairane, Turbhe, Sanpada, Ghansoli and Vashi. Localities that have direct tap connections to the main pipeline will also face a water supply suspension. In addition to this, CIDCO-administered areas such as Kharghar and Kamothe will also face disruption.\nDuring the shutdown, there will be no water service on Friday evening, July 18, or Saturday morning, July 19. The water supply is expected to be restored by Saturday evening, but it will be at low pressure.\nThe NMMC has urged all households in the impacted districts to store sufficient water in advance and use it sparingly during the disruption. NMMC officials emphasised that this connection work is critical for preventing future leaks and providing a more stable water delivery system for the city in the long run.\n“We urge citizens to bear with the temporary inconvenience and support the civic body in completing this critical work on schedule and without delays and use water mindfully,\" an NMMC officer was quoted as saying by the Free Press Journal.\nThe officials further stressed that the scheduled work aligns with broader efforts to create gender-inclusive, sustainable and community-sensitive urban services.\nAbout the Author\nBuzz Staff\n- Location :\n- First Published:\nTerms of Useand\nPrivacy Policy.",
