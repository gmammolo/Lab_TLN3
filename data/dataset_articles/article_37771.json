  "text": "Vancouver resident Wynn Grcich encourages other residents to get involved in addressing issues in the city Editor ’s note: Opinions expressed in this letter to the editor are those of the author alone and may not reflect the editorial position of ClarkCountyToday.com\nAs the summer is warming up, Vancouver is having lots of outdoor activities. I hope you take some time to go to Esther Short Park, “The Free Speech Area,” by Farmer’s Market and meet Justin Forsman who is running against Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle. He will be knocking on doors with other PCOs soon. Tell him your concerns. He will listen to you and wants everyone’s input.\nWynn Grcich You have to admire Justin Forsman for being the only macho man, out of the 2025 population of 199,884 to take on this challenge. He was not going to let this mayor go unopposed. He waited until the afternoon of the last day to file.\nI hear nothing but complaints about the Vancouver City Council but only one woman signed up to run against one council member. The public has allowed this to happen.\nWe need to give him all the support and help to win this battle. It takes donations, boots on the ground, fund raisers, and work. We appreciate every vote, but it takes more than an X or check in a box to get someone elected. Volunteer. Where are the high school students who need 40 hours of volunteerism to graduate? This would be a good lesson in Civics since the schools don’t teach that anymore!\nRob Anderson needs help with his election integrity campaign. Rob gave a beautiful speech about the biblical reason to vote. We need the church people to participate.\nThe mayor is very unpopular right now and doesn’t work for the people. Forsman is your chance to replace her! He wants to root out corruption. Fight for clean water. Stop excessive taxes. Save our streets. Reduce parking fees. No sanctuary city policies. NO TOLLS. Medical freedoms.\nForsman is God loving, and believes in our constitution.\nThe current Vancouver Council does their own thing and forgets they work for you!\nThe mayor had her election signs up, months before she applied to run again, on the last day of sign up. Isn’t that illegal? It is certainly an eye sore to see these election boards for over half a year. Dictators throughout history do that kind of posting their name and pictures all over their countries or cities. Chairman Mao, Stalin, Saddam Hussein, Lenin, etc.\nI can’t wait for the debates as the election draws near. Forty-four million in debt while the city is being redeveloped. How is she paying the construction workers? We need DOGE. Every dollar should be accounted for and the budget met. No over spending! She is still spending and taxing you to death. Making more small business owners go bankrupt, while she cuts off sidewalk access to their business and eliminating street parking.\nHave you ever Read the book: Behind the Green Door , by Rosa Kory? Rosa assessed property value when the government took them by emanate domain. Rosa went all over the country and Europe teaching everyone what the government was doing to become the N.W.O and she taught about the ICLEI. http://www.rosakoire.com\nMayor Anne could have gotten the contractors to purchase the properties on Main Street so the business owners could move or offer to relocate them temporarily to a new empty building, until their street is finished, and they could move back. Forcing business owners out of business is evil! Her decision to close the streets will bankrupt the businesses on Main Street because of the mayor’s three-year redevelopment construction plan.\nCome meet Justin Forsman, the self-employed business man who stepped up to take on this horrendous challenge, to bring our local government back to balance and represent the constituents. He knows the issues and wants your ideas and complaints about the current situation. They will still be required to pay their leases or mortgages, insurance, etc. The cost to relocate is also very expensive.\nRob Anderson needs help too, with his election integrity campaign. He gave a beautiful speech about the biblical reason to vote. Church people must participate to help take this city, county, and state back. Volunteer!\nIt takes all of us to make this change!\nI truly admire Foresman for taking on this challenge. It takes desire, leadership, and community effort to make it happen!\nIsaiah 53.6: “All we like sheep having gone astray: we have turned everyone to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.’’\nWe are all needed to get this job done. With God’s help we can do this.\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/weedkiller-ingredient-widely-used-in-us-can-damage-organs-and-gut-bacteria-re\nWe need this poison banned in Clark County and Vancouver.\nWynn Grcich\nVancouver",
