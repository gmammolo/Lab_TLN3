  "text": "The executive director of the Kosovo Law Institute (KDI), Ismet Kryeziu, has reacted harshly to the positions of officials of the Vetëvendosje Movement, who, according to him, are attacking the justice system and encouraging citizens to disrespect court decisions. In a public post, Kryeziu stated that what the incumbent Government is doing through its highest officials constitutes an open call for anarchy. \"There has been much talk about interference, pressures, delays, inefficiency and selective justice. But, despite all these weaknesses, I do not remember that people in power have ever openly come out against the justice system by publicly refusing to implement court decisions,\" he wrote. Kryeziu emphasizes that, unlike previous individual cases such as escapes or disobedience, this is now a matter of direct calls from state figures to disrespect Supreme Court decisions. \"This is no longer influence or pressure – it is incitement to anarchy. This is an open invitation to return the social order from the constitution and the law, to the norms of self-justification and canonical values,\" he added. In conclusion, Kryeziu warned that any attempt to legitimize this approach poses a serious risk to the rule of law and to the very foundations of democracy in the country.",
