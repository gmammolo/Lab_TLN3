  "text": "Manchester United’s summer transfer window is not going well, with Ineos falling into the same traps as the previous regime.\nAfter a year to settle in, Ineos were supposed to be prepared for the transfer window, after having spent 12 months getting the house in order.\nHowever, after signing Matheus Cunha on July 1st things have gotten embarrassing for those making the transfer decisions at Old Trafford.\nLast season, Manchester United recorded a worst ever Premier League finish, making this summer key. But for the past 45 days and counting, United have spent every waking minute on Bryan Mbeumo, refusing to pay Brentford’s initial demands which have now risen as a result of the painfully slow transfer progress.\nWe still expect a deal for Mbeumo to be completed, however this leaves little time for subsequent additions before the season starts, meaning they won’t have the chance to fully settle in.\nUnited still want four additions in key areas once Mbeumo joins, which makes recent reports concerning.\nManchester United in contact over Pervis Estupinan transfer\nMost of the Manchester United squad could do with a new signing, however, there are priorities for a reason and among them is not a left wing-back.\nUnited signed Patrick Dorgu in January for £25m, adding to Harry Amass as an emerging talent in the role, Diogo Dalot as a make-shift option and Luke Shaw as a veteran when available.\nThis summer has also seen Diego Leon join United, which makes for five players capable of doing a job at left wing-back. Yet, United links to Pervis Estupinan refuse to go away.\nAfter initial interest was reported back in May, now, it has been claimed that United have approached Estupinan’s agents to discuss a possible move this summer.\nEstupinan is a player in his prime and is known by Premier League fans for his brilliant performances in a Brighton shirt, but signing the Ecuadorian is absolutely not what United need in a summer of financial constraint.\nIn fact, Ineos approaching the player is a major concern.\nIneos’ interest in Estupinan is concerning for Manchester United\nThe signing of Estupinan is not close at the moment, and on the surface it would not be a terrible transfer, however, this summer it should be sixth in the list of priorities at best.\nSo for Ineos to be making an approach to the players side is worrying.\nIf director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada are deciding that another left wing-back needs to be signed it is a sign that they don’t have a clue about the needs of the squad, considering the positions which desperately need attention and for players to be approached.\nAdditionally, just six months after signing Dorgu, it would represent Ineos not being confident in their business which hardly inspires confidence that we should be trusting their decisions going forward.\nIf United sign Estupinan on deadline day for cheap, it would be acceptable, but a penny shouldn’t be sent to left wing-back before a midfielder, striker, goalkeeper and arguably a right wing-back are looked at.",
