  "text": "Melvin K. Shook, 91, passed away peacefully at the home of his son, Jeff, where he has been in home hospice since February, on Tuesday, July 8, 2025. He was born and raised in Seville and was a 1952 graduate of Elyria High School. He met and married his high school sweetheart, Jean Ruth (nee Clement) in 1954. Mel worked at the Chronicle-Telegram delivering newspapers, moved into the pressroom, and eventually became production manager until his retirement in 1996. Mel and Jean retired to Florida in 1999. They enjoyed traveling all over the United States and saw all 50 States. They also loved going to casinos and visiting family and friends. After Jean passed, Mel moved back to Ohio and has lived with his son, Jeff and his wife, Marilyn for the past three years. Mel is survived by his daughter, Ellen Phillips; sons, Dean (Denise) and Jeff (Marilyn); grandchildren, Dean Lee, and Misti. He was preceded in death by his wife, Jean in 2020; parents, George and Bessie Shook; brother, Philip; sisters, Rena Good and Belva Berry; stepbrother, Richard Cleckner; stepsister, Betty Pilarczyk; and multiple nieces and nephews. There will be no services per Mel's request. In lieu of flowers, family requests memorial contributions be made to the American Heart Association or Buckeye Hospice in Mel's memory. The family wishes to thank the nurses, aides, social workers and doctors at Buckeye Hospice for the care of our Dad during this time. Arrangements have been entrusted to the Laubenthal- Mercado Funeral Home and Cremation Services of Elyria. Online condolences may be expressed at www.laubenthalmercado.com",
