  "title": "Miami Concert Fan Kicks Another Man Several Rows Down the Stadium in Morgan Wallen Tour, 'He Has the High Ground!' | The Nerd Stash",
  "text": "Concerts are meant to be loud and rowdy, but a Morgan Wallen Tour concert, which took place in Miami, Florida, got a little too riotous thanks to two guys. One of the guys even recklessly kicked another man, sending him tumbling several rows down the stadium and ruining the concert for others.\nThe incident happened during Morgan Wallen’s “I’m the Problem” tour in Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida, back on July 12. For the concert, Morgan Wallen used a side of the stadium, and an altercation between two men took place in the nosebleed seats of the stadium section.\nIt’s not clear what led to the altercation, but the man who assaulted the other fan in front of him started by kicking him down, which sent him a couple of rows back. Angry at his assailant, the fallen fan climbed back up row-by-row, only to be kicked down again by the same assailant, and this time, he came tumbling further down at around four rows.\nOther fans were notably angry and frustrated since the concert was in full swing, and some viewers have even noticed that the kick was well-timed to the chorus or an important part of the song. Sadly, the video was cut too early, and we likely won’t see how the other man fared, especially after falling down a steep row of hard plastic chairs.\nSome Climbs Aren’t Worth It\nPeople online were quick to point out how unwise it was to put yourself in the same disadvantageous position after getting kicked by someone higher up. Some have compared the situation to a pop culture meme from Star Wars, namely Obi-Wan’s famous high-ground scene with Anakin.\n“Literally when he started going back up, I was like ‘No, don’t, he has the high ground!'” recalls sideshowbvo\n“Dude as he’s climbing back up ‘You underestimate my power’ 😂🤣,” jokes Professional_Run_817\nThough despite the more lighthearted reactions that seem to have minimized the man’s injury, the altercation could very well result in a battery case and even a lawsuit, as there’s clear video evidence of the assault. Others couldn’t help but notice how steep the seats were and how painful the man’s fall could be, especially if he hit his head or hit other Miami concert-goers along the way.\n“He really choose the perfect moment on that last kick. Man dropped 4 rows. Those seats are so steep, that would be terrible,” worries Informal-Force-4030\n“That’s a great setup to get your neck broken,” according to Raumfalter\nHopefully, the man who initiated the assault gets the punishment he deserves, because kicking or shoving someone from a great height could’ve easily endangered several people, especially in a public event, and no amount of verbal disagreements warrants such a reaction.",
