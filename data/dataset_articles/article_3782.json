  "text": "Baltimore City marks 'historic drop' in homicides for 2023 A culmination of strategies contributed to a decrease in homicides in Baltimore, the mayor told 11 News. Baltimore is closing out 2023 with a drop in homicides of almost 21% compared to last year. Mayor Brandon Scott told 11 News it's oversimplifying to give credit to one group or strategy, saying it wasn't one thing, but a network of strategies that cut homicides from 327 in 2022 to 259 in 2023, as of Friday morning. - Fewer than 300: While [homicides are down in Baltimore City](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-city-homicide-streak-2023-statistics-murder-rate/46202893), shootings involving juveniles are rising compared to 2022. Go by the numbers [here](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/shootings-juveniles-increases-baltimore-crime/46236351). This marks the first time the city has recorded fewer than 300 homicides since 2014. And, though the mayor doesn't credit any single initiative, he did say the city's [Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-city-comprehensive-violence-prevention-plan/37111265) -- which features multi-layered approaches such as a public health approach to violence, community engagement and accountability policies -- has been crucial in reducing homicides and nonfatal shootings. \"These are historic drop numbers for Baltimore. This will be the largest single-year drop on record in homicides for the city of Baltimore, something that we should acknowledge and understand the significance of that,\" Scott said. \"This is a result of us putting forward our [Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-city-comprehensive-violence-prevention-plan/37111265) a few years ago, where we set the goal that we were going to reduce homicides by 15%, and now exceeding that at almost 21%.\" - Is it working? In October, city police revealed new information on efforts to reduce violent crime. [Full story here](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/group-violence-reduction-strategy-baltimore-update-2023/45511648). City officials have debated the cause of the decrease all year. Video below: Drop in homicides attributed to multiple strategies \"We are beginning to see some of the fruit of our labor,\" former Baltimore City Police Commissioner Michael Harrison [said in February](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-crime-violence-strategies-police-commissioner/43122469). \"We're going to try to saturate as many officers as we can into some of our problematic areas,\" then Acting Police Commissioner Richard Worley [said in June](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-police-incentives-officers-work-entertainment-areas-city-council/44287662). Seeking answers outside the department revealed even more layers. \"Baltimoreans are willing to step away from the life when given the opportunity,\" then Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement Director Shantay Jackson [said in April](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/reduce-violence-crime-baltimore-strategy-impact/43581159). While juvenile homicides are slightly down, the number of [non-fatal juvenile shootings has seen a significant increase](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/shootings-juveniles-increases-baltimore-crime/46236351). Major cities across the country are also seeing a decrease in homicides and other types of crime, including Detroit, Chicago and Philadelphia. \"I've been in Baltimore many years when the national homicide rate was dropping and Baltimore's wasn't. It wasn't bucking that trend,\" Scott said. \"Our drop is double that of the national drop. 10% is what is down nationally. We're at almost 21%.\" Without Baltimore's comprehensive strategies, Scott said Baltimore could be seeing certain types of crime rise like in Washington, D.C. \"When you think about our neighbors in D.C., they're not seeing it and they're right down the road. This is about our approach that is unique to Baltimore,\" Scott said. Despite the decrease, [two recent community surveys](https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-city-police-resident-opinions-consent-decree-survey/45795577) show that many city residents have a negative view of the Baltimore City Police Department and question how effective the department is at solving and reducing crime. Scott said a key for 2024 will be to build on what is already working.",
