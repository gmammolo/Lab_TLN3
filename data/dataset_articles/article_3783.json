  "text": "One fan has remade the entire GTA VI trailer within GTA V By Justin Diaz December 29, 2023 Rockstar’s GTA VI reveal trailer has received the remake treatment, but perhaps not in the way you’d have thought. One enterprising fan has taken it upon themselves to recreate the trailer using footage from within the game of GTA V.\nThe desire alone to complete such a project makes this trailer impressive. But what really gives it that eye-catching pop to help it stand out is the lengths the creator went to to make it as faithful as possible. First, let’s get a few things straight here. It’s very clear that not every frame could be made to look exactly like what Rockstar put out in the official trailer. For one the game engine is different so the graphics look dated. But that doesn’t mean the GTA VI trailer remake doesn’t look darn close. Advertisement Advertisement\nIn fact, it’s surprising how close it is. So much so that it makes you wonder how long it took to put this together. It was obviously less than a few weeks. Since Rockstar only officially put out the GTA VI reveal trailer on December 4. That being said, it’s entirely possible that this remade trailer took from the moment the official trailer was released until this week. As it was published just a couple of days ago.\nThe GTA VI trailer remake serves as a visual comparison Because the two trailers are so close together, the fan remake created by RavenwestR1 serves as a great visual comparison. You can look at both the official trailer and the remake and imagine how much improvement GTA VI is going to deliver when it comes to graphics.\nGTA V was originally released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 generation after all. Having said that, RavenwestR1 made the trailer using the PC version of the game. Which is noticeably visually enhanced over the original release. Nevertheless, you can tell how much of a jump GTA VI will be from GTA V. Even in GTA V’s current state.\nIf you’re wondering about how RavenwestR1 created the trailer , it seems they used a series of different mods. They also note that the game’s Chop Shop update hampered their progress due to it causing game crashes with all the mods used. In short, this was a labor of love that only a true dedicated fan would create. Since it was at the expense of having to deal with constant crashes and a complete game reinstall.\nIf you’re curious to check them out, you can view both the trailer remake and the side-by-side comparison videos below.",
