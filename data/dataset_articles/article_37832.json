  "text": "A group of Irish-Syrian activists has written to the Labour Party asking it not to back Independent TD Catherine Connolly’s bid for the presidency.\nThe Galway West representative officially confirmed her candidacy on Tuesday with the backing of TDs and Senators who will provide some of the 20 Oireachtas member votes she needs to secure a place on the ballot.\nShe met the Labour Party, which is considering supporting her campaign, on Tuesday. But earlier this week party leader Ivana Bacik and other elected representatives were asked by the Irish-Syria Solidarity Movement not to back Ms Connolly’s campaign.\nMs Connolly’s visit to Syria alongside three other TDs, at a time when the regime of Bashar al-Assad was still in power, has been the subject of scrutiny since she became publicly linked to a presidential run.\nIn an email sent to Ms Bacik and others, the group thanked the Labour leader for her previous support of Syria, which they said was “unique among Irish TDs”.\nIn the email, the group asked the party not to endorse Ms Connolly as it believes she is “not fitted to this role”.\nThe group said it would find it “shocking and deeply disappointing” if Labour backs her. And it argued that the trip “provided legitimacy to the Assad regime and its narrative”.\nThe group also flagged concerns that Ms Connolly launched former MEP Clare Daly’s bid for re-election to the European Parliament last year. Ms Daly, along with Mick Wallace and Maureen O’Sullivan, were the other TDs to make the trip to Syria.\nOn Wednesday, Ms Connolly spoke about her vision for the presidency and defended her record, including the trip she took to Syria\nAt the time, Assad was still in office and engaged in a civil war.\nAsked about the visit, she replied that she funded the trip herself, its purpose was “fact-finding” and she “met no member of government”.\nShe said she visited a refugee camp outside Damascus and “saw first-hand the destruction of a whole city”, adding: “I mean, my idea, up to then, of a refugee camp wasn’t up to scratch really.”\nMs Connolly said they were shown around by Palestinians and “we stayed with them all of the time”.\nThey travelled to Aleppo and met the chamber of commerce and also had a meeting with Unicef, as well as visiting a convent.\n“On no occasion had I anything to do with the government, nor did I ever utter one word of support for Assad,” she said.\nIs Mary Lou McDonald about to enter the presidential race?\nLabour has sent a survey to its members seeking views on how it should proceed in the presidential race and asked directly whether it should support Ms Connolly’s bid. There are varying views among Labour politicians over such a move, which may ultimately be immaterial to her nomination, but still has an impact on the campaign. Support for her candidacy could prove to be consequential for the party as it mulls involvement in the Áras race.\nSeveral Labour TDs believe privately the choice is between supporting Ms Connolly or nobody at all. One TD said some members are voicing concerns about supporting Ms Connolly and, while not a majority, more are coming out to say they would be unhappy “with each passing day”.",
