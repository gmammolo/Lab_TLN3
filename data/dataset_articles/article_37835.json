  "text": "West Indies burly all-rounder Andre Russell is all set to quit international cricket, after playing the opening two matches of a five-match T20I series against Australia, according to ESPNCricinfo. The 37-year-old Russell has been included in the Caribbean squad for two of the five-match series, which are scheduled to be played at Sabina Park in Jamaica. Since 2019, he has been an integral part of the West Indies T20I team. Having played 84 shortest format matches for the country, the right-hander has amassed 1078 runs with an average of 22.00 and a strike rate of 163.08. He also has three half-centuries with a top score of 71 runs. With the ball, the veteran has claimed 61 wickets with an average of 30.59 and the best bowling figures of three wickets for 19 runs. Russells retirement has come seven months before the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, which is set to be hosted by India and Sri Lanka in February 2026. He is the West Indies second bigwig who has announced retirement in recent times. Earlier, their premier batsman Nicholas Pooran drew curtains on his international career at the age of 29. Russell has only played one Test for WI, while he has also played 56 ODIs, scoring 1,034 runs at an average of 27.21, with a strike rate of over 130, four half-centuries and a best score of 92*. In ODIs, he has 70 wickets at an average of 31.84, with best bowling figures of 4/35. The 37-year-old was part of the West Indies team which won the ICC T20 World Cups in 2012 and 2016. Russell has played a massive part in several T20 leagues, scoring 9,316 runs in 561 matches at an average of 26.39, with a strike rate of over 168. His resume includes two centuries and 33 fifties, with a best score of an unbeaten 121 runs. As a bowler, he has taken 485 wickets at an average of 25.85, with best figures of 5/15. He recently featured in the Major League Cricket (MLC) in the USA for Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), scoring 126 runs in nine matches and eight innings at an average of 25.20, with a best score of an unbeaten 65 runs, his solitary half-century. He also took 10 wickets at an average of 32.90, with best figures of 3/30. His team failed to make it to the playoffs, finishing at the bottom of the table. West Indies squad for T20Is against Australia: Shai Hope (capt), Jewel Andrew, Jediah Blades, Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Gudakesh Motie, Rovman Powell, Andre Russell, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd.
