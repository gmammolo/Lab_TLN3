  "text": "Dallas\nWoman Busted With Weed at DFW Airport Breaks Into Dance\nBy Johnny Thrash,\n8 hours agoA woman at Dallas-Fort Worth International was busted with a whole lot of marijuana. Her reaction was priceless. I’m no legal expert, but I would imagine she’s looking at spending some significant time in prison, based on the size of the brick the cop pulls out of the bag in the video below. Most folks would be pretty distressed over that.",
