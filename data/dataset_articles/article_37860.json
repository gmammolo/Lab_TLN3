  "text": "HUNTINGTON — Home was no kinder to the Coal Cats on Tuesday.\nTri-State fell to Bluefield 2-0 at Jack Cook Field for its fourth consecutive Appalachian League loss.\nThe previous three had come away from Huntington, and the Coal Cats are away again on a five-game road swing after Wednesday’s scheduled home bout with the division-leading Ridge Runners.\nFive Bluefield pitchers combined to fan 16 Tri-State hitters while allowing three hits in the shutout — Christian Charalambous (Presbyterian), Evan O’Neill (Indiana), Zach Applegate (Abilene Christian), Ethan Rucker (Georgetown) and Evan Mobley (Florida Southern).\nApplegate got the win with two hitless and scoreless innings. He struck out four.\nMobley accrued a save, pitching around two hits and a walk in two innings of work. He had three punchouts.\nNone of the quintet threw more than 35 pitches.\nJackson Golden (Marshall), Luke Kosko (no college listed) and Tyler Smolinski (Kansas State) each had a hit for the Coal Cats (12-20 entering Wednesday’s game). Golden’s was a double.\nTri-State got two runners on base with one out in the bottom of the ninth when Smolinski singled to move Kosko to second.\nBut Mobley struck out Julio Solier (Boston College) and pinch-hitter Chandler Murray (Kansas State), both looking, to end it.\nRyan Niedzwiedz (SIU Edwardsville) was 3 for 5, doubled twice and drove in a run for the Ridge Runners (21-13 entering Wednesday’s game). Cole Decker (Indiana) and Josh Hines (Florida Southern) each had two hits.\nKenneth Jackson (Southern) took the loss for the Coal Cats. He allowed two runs, both earned, on six hits over four frames. He issued three walks and had three strikeouts.",
