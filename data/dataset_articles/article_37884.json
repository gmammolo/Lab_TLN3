  "text": "Podgorica resident Igor Nedović (29) succumbed to his injuries at the Clinical Center in Podgorica, after being previously wounded by gunfire in Stara Varoš.\nAccording to unofficial information from Vijesti, he was shot with an automatic weapon while standing in front of his house and talking to a friend who was on a motorcycle.\nThe same source claims that a male person then ran up and fired 15 shots.\n\"The attacker approached them from behind while they were talking, they didn't even notice him. After he opened fire, the motorcyclist fell off his motorcycle and ran away... He only shot at Nedović,\" said the source for Vijesti.\nThe Police Directorate officially confirmed that a firearm was used near the victim's family home, on Gojka Radonjića Street, and Nedović was seriously injured.\nThey claim that this happened around 13.30:XNUMX p.m.\n\"After receiving medical assistance, he succumbed to his injuries at the Clinical Center of Montenegro. Officers of the Regional Security Center 'Centar' and the Crime Prevention Sector, with the active support of other organizational units of the Police Directorate, and in coordination with the Higher State Prosecutor's Office in Podgorica, are undertaking investigative measures and actions to shed light on this criminal offense, identify and locate the perpetrator,\" the Police Directorate announced.\nNedović was wounded in mid-May in a cafe in the Podgorica neighborhood of Siti Kvart, and the Police Department announced at that time that the shooting occurred around 13.30:XNUMX p.m.\n\"It is suspected that an unknown person entered the restaurant and fired three projectiles from a firearm in the direction of IN, which resulted in him sustaining injuries to his stomach,\" the UP said.\nIn their first public address after the shooting, the Police Department announced that the capacities of the Crime Prevention Sector and the Special Police Unit were made available to officers of the Podgorica Security Department...\nThree days after the shooting, they announced that they had solved the attempted murder of the 29-year-old.\nThe suspects are Tarik Muminović (21) and Arjan Rečković (22).\n\"By undertaking numerous operational, tactical, technical and forensic measures and actions in coordination with the Higher State Prosecutor's Office, police officers identified the perpetrators of this serious criminal offense, the direct perpetrator and the accessory, in a relatively short period of time, and these are persons AR(22) and TM(21) from Podgorica,\" the Police Directorate said in a statement at the time.\nThey explained that they have reason to suspect that on May 17, Rečković approached a table with three people sitting at it and fired three projectiles from a firearm, a pistol, in the direction of Nedović, after which he fled...\nPolice officers, they announced at the time, found the means of committing the crime through an extensive search of the wider area and the escape route.\n\"AR is registered in the police records as a repeat offender in the commission of crimes with elements of violence and crimes in the field of fires and explosions, while TM is registered in the police records as a repeat offender in the commission of crimes with elements of violence, property crime and drug abuse, while the injured party IN is registered in the Police Directorate records as an operationally interesting person close to a member of an organized criminal group. Based on operational and intelligence analyses, the conclusion is drawn that this crime was committed as a consequence of the actions of opposing organized criminal groups,\" the police said.\nBonus video:",
