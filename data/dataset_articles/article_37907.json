  "text": "Mesa burglary victim believes suspect is tied to another East Valley break-in\nMESA, AZ (AZFamily) — The owner of JBB Barber & Beauty Salon in Mesa near Southern Avenue believes the person who burglarized his shop is the same suspect who broke into a burger joint in Tempe.\nThe break-in happened on July 5 at 2:20 a.m. The security video shows the suspect smashing the glass door, stealing the cash register and running away in 15 seconds.\n“That was mostly frustration because I wasn’t expecting that. I’ve been here in the plaza for 10 years and that was the first time this happened,” said Elmer Mendez.\nHe said the suspect stole $120 and caused nearly $600 in damage. “I think they need to find a job. That’s all they need to do instead of doing that stuff,” said Mendez.\nHe said after watching surveillance video from a July 7 burglary at Johnny’s Burgers & Dogs in Tempe, he noticed some similarities with the suspect.\nIn a side-by-side comparison of both burglary security videos, the suspect was wearing all black and broke the windows with a rock. He went straight for the registers.\nThe biggest giveaway is what he was wearing on his hands: bright, green gloves. Mendez said he showed the videos to Mesa police and said a detective told him it’s believed to be the same suspect.\nMendez’s shop is just an 11-minute drive away from the Tempe business down Southern Avenue. He thinks the suspect is casing out small businesses in the East Valley before striking.\nMendez said an employee from a business next door told him they noticed a car waiting nearby around 1 a.m. He said they have security guards at the plaza and he isn’t sure how the suspect slipped past them.\n“I don’t know if he done a couple more people in those places, or if he keep doing them right now,” said Mendez.\nMendez wants other businesses to be cautious while police work on making an arrest. “A lot of people work hard for their stuff and it doesn’t feel good when someone takes it away from you,” he said.\nArizona’s Family shared Mendez’s security video with Tempe police, who said they will be looking into it. A Mesa police spokesperson said they are working to get a status on the case from detectives.\nSee a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
