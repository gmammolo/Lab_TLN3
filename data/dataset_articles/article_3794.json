  "text": "News -\nMet Police officers and staff recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List\nMet Police officers and a member of police staff have been recognised in the King’s New Year honours for their achievements and exceptional service.\nCommissioner Sir Mark Rowley said: “I would like to congratulate all our colleagues who have been recognised in the King’s New Year Honours List for their remarkable achievements. These awards are hugely deserved and very special; I hope that the recipients and their families and loved ones take great pride in them.\n\"The awards reflect a variety of contributions across different aspects of policing in London and beyond. From preventing and investigating terrorism and knife crime, to leading large-scale ceremonial and sporting events and promoting inclusion and equality across our organisation; this is a snapshot of our exceptional people. I am incredibly impressed and proud of their extraordinary service to the communities of London and beyond.”\nThe recipients are:\nExplosives Officer Mick Kettle - Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE).\nAwarded for his work in the UK and abroad as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) operator.\nDetective Inspector Rasheed Alawiye – British Empire Medal (BEM).\nAwarded for developing and championing diversity and inclusion initiatives across the Met.\nCommander Karen Findlay - King’s Police Medal (KPM) and Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO).\nAwarded for successfully delivering and co-ordinating the policing operation for The State Funeral of Her Majesty The Queen and high-profile events and public order operations.\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Ward – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for delivering the Birmingham Commonwealth Games policing plan with West Midlands Police, improving police legitimacy and inclusion, and his work in Counter Terrorism.\nDetective Chief Inspector Matthew Gosling – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for leadership in response to counter terrorism and national security threats in the UK, including threat to life and national security investigations at national level.\nDetective Chief Superintendent Hayley Sewart – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for her role in transforming the national knife crime portfolio.\nDetective Inspector Amanda Stephenson – King’s Police Medal (KPM).\nAwarded for her work as a Family Liaison Officer (FLO).\nSergeant Nicholas Birch – Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection.\nDetective Constable Kevin Malkin - Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection.\nSergeant Elizabeth St Clair - Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO).\nFor service in royalty and specialist protection\nDAC Matt Ward joined the Met in April 2023, having previously worked at West Midlands Police for over 27 years. Matt led the policing and security operation for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Matt is also one of the national leads for the Police Race Action Plan which aims to improve policing for Black people and he is passionate about making policing an anti-racist organisation.\nDAC Ward said: \"I’m incredibly humbled to receive this award but I also feel a bit like an imposter because success in policing is always about the team and not the individual. Throughout my career I’ve been very fortunate to work with some incredible teams and many exceptional colleagues, first in West Midlands Police and now as a proud Met officer. I want to thank the countless officers, staff and family members whose support and friendship sits behind this honour.”\nCommander Karen Findlay has more than 13 years’ experience delivering challenging high-profile events and public order operations. As gold commander, Karen was responsible for the successful delivery and co-ordination of the policing operation for the State Funeral for Her Majesty The Queen.\nShe was also recognised for her efforts in championing diversity and building relationships with young people and policing; and her role representing Scotland’s women’s rugby team, as player, captain and coach.\nCommander Findlay, said: “I am deeply honoured and humbled to receive these special awards. It is a lovely unexpected surprise. Having transferred south of the border from Grampian Police in 1993 to the Met, I have over the last 30 years had the privilege of working with many amazing people who have given me support, advice, encouragement and friendship. None more so than within public order policing. To lead the Met through the policing operations for the The State Funeral for Her Majesty The Queen and Their Majesties' Coronation will always remain the privileges of my life.”\nDetective Chief Superintendent Hayley Sewart has played a pivotal role in transforming the national policing knife crime portfolio since she joined in 2017. She pioneered a new approach to tackle knife crime in the Met and reduce serious violence by creating Op Sceptre; initially a locally delivered operation which focused on periods of action to tackle knife crime across the capital. This has since been rolled out nationally and achieved fantastic results.\nDCS Sewart said: “I’m surprised and thrilled to receive this award. It’s also recognition for the small team of volunteers and the working group who have supported me over the last few years.”\nMick Kettle has dealt with the most complex terrorist bombs in very demanding circumstances requiring him to always put the safety of others before his own. He has promoted and lectured on safe explosive ordnance disposal internationally, including deployments to Oman, Bahrain, Singapore and the USA. Prior to joining the Met Police he spent 25 years as an ammunition technician in the British Army, achieving the highest level of qualification in improvised explosive device disposal.\nDCI Matthew Gosling has led the police response to numerous counter terrorism and national security related threats over the last six years. His work has been vital in saving lives and protecting UK national security. This includes leading the response to national threat to life operations and national security investigations.\nDI Rasheed Alawiye developed a campaign for meaningful cultural change and instigated action across the Met Police to debate inclusion, diversity and equality by developing ‘Discussions Matter’ a series of videos that brought together officers and staff from different backgrounds where personal experiences of diversity; addressing uncomfortable topics in a way that was authentic, respectful, informative and productive.\nDI Alawiye said: “I’m honoured, proud and humbled by this nomination. It’s a nod to the brave individuals within the diversity and inclusion groups that I’ve been involved in over the years, and the leaders that have afforded me the time to pursue this work. Policing is great, I think we all just want the public to see that.”\nDI Amanda Stephenson was one of the first Family Liaison Officers (FLO) in the UK and has served in this role since 1997. This valuable role has impact both on investigations, but more importantly on the trust and confidence of the public. She has supported the victims of tragedies including 9/11, the Bali Terrorist Attack and the Grenfell Tower fire. Amanda is also a crisis negotiator, a mentor and a mental health campion.\nDI Stephenson said: “This area of policing is tragic and sad but my role has allowed me to assist families by providing a direct line of communication to and from the investigation team. I am extremely honoured and humbled to be recognised for this work, but totally appreciate the amazing teamwork involved in all of these incidents.”\n+ If you would like to make a difference by fighting crime and serving communities, consider a rewarding career as a Met police officer.
