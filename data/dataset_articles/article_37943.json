  "text": "[FILE PHOTO] Photo courtesy of DMW Kimberly Anne Ojeda Published on: 17 Jul 2025, 04:56\nCopied\nAuthorities have yet to confirm which of the 13 missing Filipino seafarers from the Houthi-attacked MV Eternity C are among the casualties or survivors.\nIn a press conference Wednesday night at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1, Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Secretary Hans Cacdac said they are aware of international media reports citing three to five possible fatalities. However, he emphasized that the Philippine government is not rushing to draw conclusions.\n“We are still in the process of verifying who among the crew are alive and who may be among the casualties,” Cacdac said, noting the sensitivity of the situation due to a recent statement from the Houthi militants.\n“We all know that the Houthis have made a statement that they’re holding several of the seafarers, so we have to regard the security aspect of this matter,” he added.\nCacdac clarified that search and rescue efforts have not been officially called off. He explained that rescue boats that initially assisted the eight rescued Filipino seafarers had to withdraw after Houthi forces surrounded the area.\n\"We are still working with the ship owner in terms of how to account for the others. And we all know as well that the ship owner sent a signal to the passing ships to also look around and observe the surroundings,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs Eduardo de Vega said the Omani Foreign Minister is ready to extend help.\nHe also confirmed that the DFA is coordinating with a Yemeni honorary consul who has links to the Houthi group.\n“We’re also asking him to reach out because there are reports that the Houthis may be holding some of the crew. Let’s wait for his confirmation. Remember, if it turns out the Houthis are indeed holding them, at least we know they’re alive,” De Vega said.\nCacdac assured that the DMW remains in close contact with the families of the 13 unaccounted seafarers. This was affirmed by a relative of one missing crew member from the MIMAROPA region, who requested anonymity.",
