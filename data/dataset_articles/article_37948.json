  "text": "A CORRESPONDENT\nDOOMDOOMA: Ila Sharma, a resident of Lachit Nagar, Rupaisiding, Doomdooma, breathed her last in a private hospital at Rupaisiding on Monday. She was hospitalized a few days back due to a heart ailment.\nShe was 82 and is survived by one son, one daughter, and two daughters-in-law. Her husband Jadav Sharma, a renowned football referee, sports pensioner, and social worker, had predeceased her a few years back.\nShe was a popular figure and closely associated with a number of socio-cultural organizations. At one time, her house was a free training centre for Bihu dance as her husband Jadav Sharma was an exponent of the art. Her elder daughter Loni was also a good Bihu dancer.\nHer death cast a pall of gloom and was widely mourned by Lachit Nagar Namghar Samiti, Doomdooma Asamiya Puja Aru Natyamandir Samiti, Doomdooma Namghar Samiti, Doomdooma Sakha Lekhika Samaroh Samiti, Doomdooma Sports Association, and others.\nAlso Read: Mid-term session of Doomdooma Press Club held with Focus on Local Issues and Community Policing\nAlso Watch:",
