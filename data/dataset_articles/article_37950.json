  "text": "David R. Bair, 65, of Akron, passed away on Wednesday, July 9, 2025, at his residence. He was born in Lancaster to the late June and Lem Bair. Dave graduated from Hempfield High School in 1978 and then Stevens Trade. Following that, he found his ultimate career path as a police officer, serving with the Manheim Township Police department from 1989-2014. Dave truly lived for his family and friends, with a focal point on his faith. He and his late wife, Terri, married in 1985 and enjoyed 34 beautiful years together, until her passing in 2019. While Dave took pride in his career as a police officer, his greatest joy in life was being a loving husband and father and raising his two children, Michael and Laura. Dave was known for his calm presence, steady leadership, humor, and nerves of steel. He led by example, earning the respect of those around him through quiet strength and unwavering dedication. Dave was wise but humble and he never took life too seriously. Except for the business of hating cats, which was always serious. In time of hardship Dave and Laura Case reconnected and rekindled a friendship from their early twenties. In 2021, Dave married Laura. Laura and David enjoyed 3.5 years of married life, which unfortunately ended way too soon. He always made it a point to tell his loved ones how truly happy he was, and he loved nothing more than spending time with his beloved grandchildren, Owen and Cora. In addition to his parents, Dave was preceded in death by his sister, Debbie (Bair) Nadu and his first wife, Terri. He is survived by his wife, Laura (Case) Bair and her two sons, Ian and Kyle Case; his two children, Michael Bair, Laura (Bair), wife of Joe Pacheco; two grandchildren, Owen Lintner, Cora Pacheco. A memorial service will be held on Friday, July 25, 2025, at 2 PM, at LCBC Manheim, 2392 Mount Joy Rd, Manheim, enter at South Entrance. Inurnment will be private at the convenience of the family.
