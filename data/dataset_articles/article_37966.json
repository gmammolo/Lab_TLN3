He would book Roman Reigns to re-form The Bloodline with The Usos and Sami Zayn upon his comeback. The angle would see The Tribal Chief-led group go head-to-head with The Rock, Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga, and Jacob Fatu in a blockbuster family feud.\nWhen not reporting on pro wrestling, Abhilash likes to work out, go on walks, read, and explore new eateries.\nKnow More Big issue with Penta revealed HERE.",
