  "text": "Joel Embiid has only played for the Philadelphia 76ers throughout his NBA career, devoting his entire career to them. Yet, he believes that suddenly he has undeservedly come under a lot of pressure from the Philadelphia media and fans. From taking the blame for James Harden's exit to knowing who the leak is inside the organisation , Embiid spoke candidly about his time with the 76ers in a recent conversation with ESPN's Dotun Akintoye . Joel Embiid, the 76ers' forward, recalled how the spiral began in his relationship with the Philadelphia media after an article wrongfully mentioned his late brother in the context of his struggles, which triggered the former MVP. \"I've done way too much for this city, putting myself at risk,\" Embiid said in October last year. \"I've done way too much for this f---ing city to be treated like this.\" There were reports that in a heated altercation in the 76ers locker room, Joel Embiid confronted the columnist and shoved him before the team staff could intervene. Consequently, Embiid was suspended from the league for three games. Now, Embiid still shows no remorse for doing what he did as he stood up for his family and doesn't feel he did anything wrong in shoving the reporter. \"I don't care if the NBA wants to fine me $1 million, $2 million, $5 million, $10 million, I would still do it,\" Embiid says. \"If he walked up to me just like he did, I would push him away again.\" Embiid only played 19 games last season, where he averaged 23.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 4.5 assists. And while missing 63 games in the regular season is something that the media is bound to look at with a microscope and most likely scrutinize, his professional performance in no way warrants the connection to his family. There is no nexus, and we have no reason to believe that Embiid's family is to blame in any way for his injury struggles. Joel Embiid has played nine seasons for the 76ers where he averaged 27.7 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 3.7 assists. Having multiple All-Star selections and a regular season MVP award, Embiid has done a lot for the 76ers in his career. But one simply cannot deny his fitness has been the biggest hurdle between him and any success beyond individual awards. If Embiid struggles to stay fit for another season, do you think it is time for the 76ers to consider trading him? It will be very hard to maximize and get any return on him if they let his trade value fall over the years. Do you think a step away from the 76ers will also be mentally healthier for Embiid? Let us know what you think in the comments section. Related: France Coach Admits He’s “Glad” Joel Embiid Didn’t Join Team For Paris Olympics",
