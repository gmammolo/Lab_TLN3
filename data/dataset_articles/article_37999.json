  "text": "Former Buffalo Bills edge rusher Von Miller is on to his next NFL destination.\nThe Bills parted ways with Miller on a cap-cutting move earlier this offseason, though general manager Brandon Beane said the door was still open for a potential return. That possibility is now gone, with Miller signing a one-year deal with the Washington Commanders.\nAfter coming within a game of the Super Bowl last season, the Commanders now have a veteran presence on their defensive line and Miller has a chance to move beyond the struggles of the last two seasons in Buffalo.\nVon Miller Announced Signing on Social Media\nMiller took to Instagram on July 16 to announce the signing, sharing a pair of pictures showing himself wearing colonial attire. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Miller still has to pass a physical, but is set to sign his one-year deal.\nAs ESPN noted, the Commanders are hoping that the All-Pro edge rusher can regain a bit of his prior form that helped another contending team get over the hump and win a Super Bowl.\n“Miller, 36, played the past three seasons with the Buffalo Bills, recording 14 sacks — eight in his first season and six last year,” the report noted. “Washington hopes he can do what he did for the Los Angeles Rams in the 2021 season: serve as a final piece in a Super Bowl title run. The Rams acquired him in a midseason trade, and he then posted five sacks in eight regular-season games and four more in the playoffs en route to a Super Bowl win.”\nMiller signed with the Bills in 2022, starting strong but suffering a year-ending torn ACL in November. He returned early in the 2023 season but struggled to regain his speed and athleticism, registering no sacks and just two total tackles in 12 games.\nMiller did recover a bit in 2024 but still failed to make a significant impact, finishing the season with 6.0 sacks. He was also suspended for four games for violating the league’s personal conduct policy, discipline that came after he faced allegations that he assaulted his pregnant girlfriend. Dallas police investigated but ultimately filed no charges in the case.\nBills Add Another Pass Rusher\nNot long after parting ways with Miller, the Bills landed Joey Bosa in the hopes of boosting their pass rush. The veteran got off to a bit of a rough start, suffering a calf injury during OTAs and missing minicamp.\nThough Bills head coach said Bosa was expected to return for training camp, the veteran edge rusher lamented the time he lost.\n“Unfortunately I’ve missed a few reps during this offseason. But I’ve been doing my best to get mental reps,” Bosa said, via the team’s official website.\nBosa added that he is excited to be returning to a 4-3 scheme, which he excelled in during his time in college at Ohio State and early in his career with the Chargers.\n“It’s exciting for me, no more outside linebacker. I’m ready to get my hand back in the dirt, get back to the six technique and rush the passer,” Bosa said.",
