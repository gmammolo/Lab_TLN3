  "text": "More than a decade ago, six friends jumped in the icy waters of the Allegheny River on New Year’s Day, starting a tradition that takes place in Parker, Armstrong County each January. On Jan. 1, 2024, veterans of the polar plunge and newbies alike will be able to ring in the new year and brave the frigid temperatures themselves at the Parker City Boat Launch, 313 N. River Ave.\nParker Polar Bear Club president Mandy Libecco, of Parker Township, said she can’t keep track of how many years the polar plunge has been taking place. With a few breaks taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said the polar plunge could be nearing its 20th anniversary.\nOne of the original six jumpers, Bob Bowser, is the founder of the Polar Bear Club sponsoring the event. The nonprofit supports local families in need, the Parker Volunteer Fire Department and other charitable organizations, Libecco said.\nWhen asked what drives people to brave the cold each year, Libecco said people love supporting a great cause, getting together and having fun.\n“I think people want something to do, something different to go out and kick-start the new year,” Bowser said.\nAround town, conversations about the polar plunge are lively, and people are excited, Libecco said.\n“People get ramped up about it,” she said.\n“We’ve had people, grown men, show up in bikinis, as Santa Claus and women in costumes and tutus,” she said.\n“There have been all kinds of costumes — some outrageous, some very interesting,” Bowser said. “It’s like Halloween in the middle of winter.”\nSometimes, people are nervous about taking the plunge.\n“There’s always apprehension because it is — it’s breathtaking — even if it’s not cold out, the water’s always cold,” Bowser said. “It’s definitely exhilarating.”\nA cannon sets off on the opposite side of the river to let participants know when to jump, he said.\n“For lack of a better word, it’s organized chaos,” Bowser said. “When there were six us originally, it was one thing. When there are 100 or 200 people, you really have to get your ducks together in a row.”\nBowser credited the local fire departments for helping keep the event organized.\n“It doesn’t happen overnight,” he said.\nLast year, the boat launch saw hundreds of participants, he said. At its peak, the event saw 400 participants.\nLibecco said a bonfire will be set up. Food, coffee and hot chocolate will also be available.\nRegistration starts at 9 a.m. and costs $25. A shirt is included in registration costs, Libecco said. The plunge is set for 2 p.m. More information can be found on the Parker Polar Plunge Facebook page .\nContinue Reading with One of the Options Below Already a subscriber?
