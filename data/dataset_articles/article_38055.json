  "text": "In my childhood, New Year’s Day meant a lunch that showcased black-eyed peas. The annual event was based on my father’s belief that the consumption of those pale-colored legumes, each with a prominent black spot, were the source of good luck in the new year.\nOften my dad made a simple soup that also featured those tasty peas. But more often, they were shown off in Hoppin’ John, a delicious concoction made with a mix of bacon and boneless ham, as well as white long-grained rice, herbs, and yes, black-eyed peas. It’s a slow-cooked wonder, and some may question my featuring it in a quick-cook column. But we all could use a potential good fortune charm.\nWishing you good luck in 2024.\nHoppin’ John Yield: 8 servings\nINGREDIENTS 6 slices bacon, chopped\n1 (1- to 1 1/2 pound) boneless ham, cut into 3/4-inch planks\n1 onion, finely chopped\n2 celery stalks, minced\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n4 cups chicken broth\n2 pounds frozen black-eyes peas; see cook’s notes\n2 bay leaves\n1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice\n3 green onions, thinly sliced, including dark green stalks\nOptional for passing: hot sauce\nCook’s notes: If desired, Melissa’s steamed black-eyed peas can be substituted for the frozen. They are sold in 11-ounce boxes, generally in the refrigerated section of the produce section. If using these steamed peas, add them in step 3 along with the rinsed rice.\nDIRECTIONS 1. Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until crispy, 5 to 7 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot and brown ham, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer ham to cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch pieces.\n2. Add onion and celery to pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth, peas, bay leaves, and ham; bring to boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until peas are tender, about 20 minutes.\n3. Place rice in fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain rice well and stir into pot. Place a square of aluminum foil directly on surface of simmering liquid. Simmer, covered, until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes, stirring and repositioning foil twice during cooking. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Discard bay leaves. Fluff rice with fork. Stir in green onions and bacon. Serve. Pass the hot sauce if desired.\nSource: “America’s Text Kitchen’s Complete Autumn and Winter Cookbook”\n ",
