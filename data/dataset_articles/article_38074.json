  "text": "The Christmas holiday may be over, but Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes kept on giving this week when he surprised a young fan named Issac Murdock with tickets to Super Bowl LVIII.\nMurdock was at the Chiefs’ facility in Kansas City for what he thought would be a routine interview about his thoughts on the reigning MVP quarterback. Midway through the interview, Mahomes walked in and presented the tickets to Murdock, creating a memory that is sure to last a lifetime.\nCheck out the video of Murdock’s surprise visit from Mahomes below:\n. @PatrickMahomes surprised a very special Chiefs fan named Isaac with tickets to Super Bowl LVIII for Christmas. 🥹❤️\n(via @Chiefs ) pic.twitter.com/RH70qNF83x\n— NFL (@NFL) December 28, 2023\nGestures like this tug at the heartstrings of fans across the country, and are a key part of what makes professional sports so special to so many people.\nMahomes and the Chiefs are known for their involvement in the Kansas City community, and this remarkable gift is yet another symbol of their commitment to making the world a better place.",
