  "text": "Chagrin Falls year-end celebration expected to be ‘poppin’ CHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio (WOIO) - Several local towns are set to do their year-end celebrations, including Chagrin Falls. Dozens of people will gather at Triangle Park to see the show New Year’s Eve. It’s a great way to “pop” into the New Year. “We raise up a giant popcorn ball the day before New Year’s eve. At the countdown to midnight, we lower the popcorn ball like they do in Times Square and that’s our small town version of a big town thing,” said the General Manager Rachal Raymond. The popcorn ball is known as Jupiter. He sits outside of the Chagrin Falls Popcorn Shop on Main Street. Employees and community members work to make sure Jupiter looks good every year. “Last year after it was done and retired for the season. It got a little funky so we had to give it a facelift. We took the outer layer off and we re-mushed the popcorn to it,” said Raymond. The Chagrin Falls tradition continues to get bigger and better. “When we first started, we had a few people with cone hats on AKA popcorn in the shape of a cone hat. A few years in we had maybe a few hundred people. Last year we had about 1500 people in town. They had streets closed off. There was literal dancing in the street. We had a Dj. It was so cool,” said Raymond. There will be music, lights and dancing this upcoming Sunday. “The community love around here is very real. Because it is such a small town. Kind of tucked away in the middle of nowhere it feel like a hallmark movie,” said Raymond. People will meet up at the Town Hall for hot cocoa and cookies at 10:30 p.m. Everyone will walk down to Triangle Park for the popcorn ball launch and dancing. Copyright 2023 WOIO.
