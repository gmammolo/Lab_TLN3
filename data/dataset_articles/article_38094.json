  "text": "Doctors say a Naugatuck man has beat the odds after he was severely injured in a motorcycle accident. A year and half ago, Chris Rivera was taken to St. Vincent's Medical Center. He was not wearing a helmet. Rivera was admitted to the center's trauma wing as a level one alert, its highest priority. Rivera's trauma surgeon, Dr. Shawna Kettyle, says she did not think Rivera would survive his injuries, which included damage to his head and bladder. He also had a broken pelvis. Dr. Kettyle tells News 12 shortly after Rivera arrived, his heart stopped beating. She was able to revive him with CPR. Rivera spent months in the hospital and was unable to walk. Following extensive rehab and additional surgery, Rivera is able to spend the holidays with his family in Puerto Rico. \"He was likely to be one of the patients who we don't get to recover from his injuries, but he luckily proved us wrong! He's back at work, he's traveling with his family for the holidays. He's come back to see us a few times and walks right into us. It's beautiful to see,\" says Dr. Kettyle.",
