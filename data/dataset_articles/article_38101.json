  "text": "Chelsea playmaker Christopher Nkunku has praised the club's supporters for the reception at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. By: eyefootball.com - Dec 29 2023 - 40 - 4860 Views The Frenchman made his full Premier League debut against Crystal Palace yesterday and had a good showing before being substituted. The fans were appreciative of his performance and speaking after the game, he was quick to thank the faithful for the response. He said: \"It meant a lot. It was the first time the stadium had heard my name as I came onto the pitch, so I want to say thank you to the fans and, of course, it gave me more motivation to continue to improve and get to my level.\" The Blues opened the scoring early against Palace but they were pegged back before the break. The second half was pretty even for both clubs. Noni Madueke 's penalty made the difference in the end and ensured that the Blues returned to the top half of the table in 10th with a victory.
