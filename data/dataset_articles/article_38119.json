  "text": "Hinsdale’s Brayden Eastman embraces members of his family after scoring his 1,000th career point against Franklin on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2023.\nReformer file photo HINSDALE, N.H. — In the Hinsdale boys basketball team’s second game of the season against Franklin, the Pacers' Brayden Eastman scored his 1,000th career point, placing him alongside a select group of people in the school’s history. The rarity of Eastman’s accomplishment makes it the Reformer’s No. 4 sports story of the year.\nEastman began the season 52 points away from the milestone. After he dropped 34 points on Sunapee in the season opener, helping lead Hinsdale to a convincing 71-42 win, he was just 18 points shy, setting the stage for him to accomplish the feat against Franklin in the team’s home opener.\nWith 2:42 remaining in the game against Franklin, Eastman surpassed the 1,000-point mark off a beautiful alley-oop pass in transition from Connor Dixon to put the Pacers up 54-44 on their way to a 58-46 win.\n“I’m definitely glad it was from one of my teammates instead of me creating a bucket for myself because people scoring 1,000 points isn’t just them, it’s the team around them that’s really, truly, the reason why they scored that 1,000 points,” said Eastman after the game.\nIn scoring the bucket, Eastman achieved a milestone that a limited number of basketball players in Hinsdale history ever have. The last player in the school’s history to score 1,000 points was Angelina Nardolillo in 2019, and Matt Boggio was the last member of the boys team to reach 1,000 points in 2016.\nHinsdale’s Brayden Eastman drives through Franklin’s defense during a boys basketball game on Tuesday, Dec. 5, 2023.\nReformer file photo Coach Carl Anderson said he had drawn up a similar play during a pause in play, but the team was unable to execute it at that time.\n“They (Franklin) had come out in the zone and then for that to happen on a fast break was even better,” Anderson said.\nHinsdale (2-0) never trailed in the game. They started the game with an 11-1 run and held a 16-7 lead after the first quarter, eight of which came from Eastman, though he was double teamed on more than one instance at the beginning of the game.\n“It was definitely getting in my head,” said Eastman of the milestone. “I was struggling throughout the beginning, but the AD (Athletic Director Sam Kilelee) said to me ‘Just keep going. Don’t worry about it. Just keep doing what you’re doing.’ I always listen to him. He’s always got good advice.”\nEastman and Dixon combined for 37 of the team’s points on the evening to help earn the win.\nThroughout the game, Eastman, who finished with 22 points, played within the offense, giving the ball up to teammates frequently to ensure that Hinsdale maintained the lead.",
