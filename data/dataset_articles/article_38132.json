  "text": "Tribune News Network\nDoha\nThe Yousuf Mubarak YA Al Kuwari-owned Miracle Nation won the inaugural Distaff Cup for trainer Hamad Al Jehani at the Al Uqda Racecourse on Thursday.\nThe three-year-old filly was given a brilliant ride by Faleh Bughanaim as she edged out Al Rufaa Racing’s Cathy Come Home in the day’s feature, the 1400m Conditions for Thoroughbred Fillies and Mares.\nThe filly did well to thwart the spirited bid of the Gassim Ghazali-trained three-year-old ridden by Szczepan Mazur to win by a neck. Abdulatif Hussain MZ Al Emadi owned and Bader Al Balushi-trained Kaliysta was ridden by Al Moatasem Al Balushi to finish third.\nJockey Szczepan Mazur guided Al Jeryan Stud’s AJS Anayid to win the 1400m Purebred Arabian Handicap (65-85) for three-year-old race.\nIn the meeting opener, Toufik in the silks of Wathnan Racing was ridden by Alberto Sanna to 1400m Local Purebred Arabian Maiden Plate race for three-six-year-olds.\nAbdulaziz Jassim Al Boenain, Al Uqda Complex Manager, presented the trophies to the winners.\n Copy 29/12/2023 10",
