  "text": "BRATTLEBORO — Project Feed the Thousands, this area’s only and largest annual campaign dedicated to raising food for individuals and families in need, is short of its goals with only a few days remaining in the campaign. “We are making a year-end appeal for help in meeting our goals,” states Project Feed the Thousands co-chair Kelli Corbeil. “We are short about $30,000 toward our original goal of $130,000. We desperately want to finish out the year with a big push. We want to cap off our 30th campaign by making it the best one ever.”\nGeorge Haynes, co-founder of Project Feed the Thousands, agrees. “We are extremely grateful for the community support we have received thus far, and what we have already raised is remarkable, but we know that it will not be enough to sustain the food shelves for the entirety of 2024. We really need some help. With so many in need of food it is imperative that we meet this year’s goals.”\nCo-Chair John Sciacca echoed Corbeil’s and Haynes’ sentiments. “We really need everyone’s help, and we want to urge people to think of Project Feed the Thousands when they make their year-end contributions. We need to raise another $30,000 in order to meet our goal, and with everyone’s help I know we can do it.”\nHaynes added, “The nine area food shelves that Project Feed is supporting this year are doing incredible work, but they have been stretched thin and they need everyone’s help so that they can carry out their important missions. Food prices remain high and the money raised by Project Feed the Thousands plays a critical role in the food shelves’ ability to serve their clientele, our friends and neighbors.”\n“This campaign only runs for a short time, once a year,” states Corbeil, “so it is critical that we meet our monetary goal over the next several days. The funds we receive during this campaign need to sustain us until the next campaign gets underway in November 2024.”\n“It’s a big ask,” states Sciacca, “but I know we can do it.”\nProject Feed the Thousands runs through December 31. Monetary, tax-deductible, contributions can be sent to Project Feed the Thousands, c/o River Valley Credit Union, PO Box 8366, Brattleboro VT 05304 or donated online at projectfeedthethousands.org or gofundme/f/project-feed-the-thousands-2023.",
