Littler, a boyhood United supporter, has sky-rocketed to fame during his incredible run to the World Darts Championship last 16 this month.\nRelated articles\nMan Utd have already agreed Mason Greenwood plan after '£40m transfer snub'\nMan Utd outcast Jadon Sancho spotted in rare footage as PSG 'make transfer call' The 16-year-old prodigy became the youngest player to reach the last 16 of the competition by beating Canadian Matt Campbell 4-1 at Ally Pally, earning £35,000 in the process.\nHe will face Raymond van Barneveld or Jim Williams for a place in the quarter-finals, with clashes with Gerwyn Price, defending world champion Michael Smith and Michael van Gerwen potentially on the horizon.\nVan de Beek enjoyed Littler's performance on Wednesday, with fellow Dutchman Van Gerwen and Smith also in action.\nAnd Littler shared an image of the pair together backstage, captioning the friendly snap \"legend\" as a compliment for the forgotten United star.\nVan de Beek was enjoying 'The Nuke' doing his thing on the Ally Pally stage as he prepares to leave England next month.\nThe 26-year-old midfield is set to join Eintracht Frankfurt on loan when the January transfer window opens, having already completed his medical at the Bundesliga club.\nClick here to join our WhatsApp community to be the first to receive breaking and exclusive Man Utd news.\nREAD MORE Man Utd receive transfer response as Erik ten Hag 'eyes second January deal' [TRANSFERS]\nLuke Littler was pictured with Donny van de Beek. (Image: INSTAGRAM) Frankfurt will reportedly have the option to make Van de Beek's move permanent for £13million next summer, which would spell the end of his disastrous Premier League career.\nThe former Netherlands international has featured in Ten Hag's last seven Premier League squads due to relentless injury issues but has played just 21 minutes of football all season.\nHe last started a competitive match for United against AFC Bournemouth in January, during which he suffered a season-ending knee injury.\nAnd he likely won't play for the Red Devils again beyond 2023, even if Frankfurt opt against making his switch permanent.\nBecome an Express Premium member\nSupport fearless journalism\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free\nGet super-fast page loading Start 30-day\nFREE trial DON'T MISS\nLittler received Man Utd gift as star keen to show Ten Hag 'how to win a trophy' [QUOTES]\nGetafe boss speaks out on Mason Greenwood after Man Utd 'receive £40m offer' [TRANSFERS]\nAndre Onana set to miss up to four Man Utd matches as Ten Hag handed dilemma [NEWS]\nDonny van de Beek is leaving Man Utd in January. (Image: Getty) READ MORE\nMan Utd chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe urged to sell 10 players despite Aston Villa win He'll be delighted with the opportunity to play more football, though, and it could also be a very happy New Year for Littler if he continues his dream World Darts Championship run.\nAhead of his last-16 clash, the teenager revealed he had received tickets to tour Old Trafford next year and joked he would show Erik ten Hag how to win a trophy.\nHe said: \"I got stuff for my Xbox, a controller, gift cards. Two tickets for the Manchester United stadium tour, so I will go to that after the Worlds. Hopefully, I'll show them how to win one [a trophy].\"\nLittler added that he enjoyed United's thrilling Boxing Day comeback against Aston Villa. But whether the victory gave him as much joy as his recent Ally Pally exploits is unlikely.\nRelated articles Transfer news as Man Utd receive Greenwood bid and Chelsea strike January deal Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers agree to awkward clause in Man Utd deal",
