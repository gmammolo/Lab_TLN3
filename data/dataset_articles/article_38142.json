  "text": "Y﻿oung gun Phoebe Litchfield starred as Australia recorded the second-highest successful run chase in women’s ODI history.\nThe Aussies took a 1-0 series lead over India by chasing down 281 with 21 balls to spare in Mumbai.\nLitchfield – the prodigious 20-year-old – whacked 78 off her 89 deliveries, and combined with veteran Ellyse Perry (75 off 72) to clinch victory.\nTheir second-wicket partnership proved crucial in chasing down India’s total.\nThe record run chase in women’s ODI history is still Australia’s 289 in 2012 to beat New Zealand at North Sydney.\nPhoebe Litchfield of Australia celebrates after scoring a 50 with Ellyse Perry.\n“Ellyse is﻿ amazing to bat with,” Litchfield said afterwards.\n“As soon as you feel under pressure she just whacks a four or a six﻿ and the scoring rate keeps going.\n“It’s awesome to be in a partnership with her.”\nFellow young star Tahlia McGrath was also pivotal in the win, blasting 68 not out off 55 balls to seal it.\nTheir heroics followed new skipper Alyssa Healy being dismissed in the first over of the chase for a duck.\nThe second ODI begins Saturday night (AEDT).",
