In this workshop we'll be using fragrance oils and paraffin wax to create our very own signature scent candles. But that's not all! We'll also be enjoying some delicious wine and snacks to enhance the overall experience.\nFirst we'll start by selecting our preferred fragrance oils from a wide range of options. Our expert candle maker will guide us through the process of measuring and mixing the ingredients allowing us to create a unique scent that perfectly suits our taste and mood.\nAs we wait for our candles to cure and set we'll take a break to enjoy some cheese crackers and other delectable snacks all perfectly paired with a selection of wines that complement the fragrances we've chosen.\nOnce our candles are ready we'll adorn them with decorative labels and packaging making them the perfect gift for friends and family or a lovely addition to our own homes.\nNo experience is necessary for this workshop so come as you are and let your creativity flow.
