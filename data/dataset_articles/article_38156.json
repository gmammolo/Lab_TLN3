Teodoro Herbosa | PHOTO: Bibo Nueva España/Senate PRIB\nThe Department of Health (DOH) has reported to President Marcos what it described as “significant strides” in ensuring more accessible and adaptable health-care services for all Filipinos as the government takes action toward the full implementation of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act of 2019.\nIn a statement, the Presidential Communications Office quoted DOH Secretary Teodoro Herbosa, saying that in the first 100 days since his appointment on June 6 this year, he focused on ensuring that health-care services are accessible to all Filipinos, regardless of their socioeconomic status.\nADVERTISEMENT “Every Filipino should benefit from UHC,” the secretary said.\nFEATURED STORIES NEWSINFO 14-year-old kills older sister in deadly Christmas gift dispute NEWSINFO Police car veering into bus lane causes road crash on Edsa; 5 hurt NEWSINFO LTO suspends license of overcharging taxi driver The DOH chief said the agency has employed the principle of “No One Gets Left Behind” aligned with an 8-point action agenda, which encompasses safe and quality service delivery, preparedness against pandemics and crises, as well as ensuring the welfare and rights of health-care workers—key aspects that underscore the much-needed transformation in the country’s health sector.\nMore Malasakit Centers For 2023, the DOH said it sustained a one-stop shop program that provides government health services for indigent patients by putting up more Malasakit Centers across the country.
