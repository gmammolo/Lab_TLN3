  "text": "Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of former President [Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump), shared some advice to ring in the new year that praises people who help others. Ivanka posted a video on her In the clip shared by Ivanka, Rogers said: \"You know, my mother used to say a long time ago whenever there would be any...catastrophe that was in the movies or on the air, she would say, 'Always look for the helpers. There will always be helpers. You know, just on the sidelines.' \"That's why I think if news programs could make a conscious effort of showing rescue teams, of showing medical people—anybody who is coming into a place where there's a tragedy, to be sure that they include that because if you look for the helpers, you'll know that there's hope.\" Ivanka captioned the post: \"As we approach the new year, let's carry the timeless wisdom of Mr Rogers with us: In these challenging times, always look for the helpers. Their presence is a beacon of hope and humanity. Their courage and kindness light the way forward. Wishing you all joy, love and hope.\" Newsweek reached out to [Ivanka Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/ivanka-trump) via Instagram direct message for comment. Ivanka, who served as a senior adviser in the Trump administration, has stayed out of the spotlight for the most part during her father's 2024 presidential run, in which he is the GOP front-runner. In November 2022, she said: \"I love my father very much\" on the day he announced he was running for the White House again. She added: \"This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family.\" Ivanka's husband, [Jared Kushner](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/jared-kushner), who headed Middle East policy in the Trump White House, has praised Donald Trump for his foreign policy as president and said that he hoped his father-in-law would be reelected in 2024. Appearing on Lex Fridman's podcast in October, Kushner said: \"I do think that the job [Trump] did as a foreign policy president was tremendous. Now, more and more people are beginning to recognize that. \"Now, under [President Biden,](https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden/) this is the second war that's broken out in the world, and when you have weak leadership, the world becomes a less safe place,\" he said, referring to the Israel-Hamas conflict. \"My hope and prayers are that President Trump is reelected and that he's able to then restore calm and peace and prosperity to the world.\" Uncommon Knowledge Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.
