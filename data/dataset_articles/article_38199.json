  "text": "Since the Cleveland Browns resumed play in 1999, the franchise's quarterback situation could be described many ways, but for certain, one way is a turnstile. From draft disappointments like Tim Couch and Johnny Manziel to journeymen like Jason Campbell and Brian Hoyer, Cleveland has seen 37 different signal callers make starts over the last 24 years. The organization's inability to find a viable quarterback of the future even spawned a notorious NFL meme . Now, though, Dude Wipes, a sponsor of the team, is offering Browns fans a chance to get rid of their (now irrelevant) quarterback jerseys ahead of Cleveland's Thursday night home matchup against the New York Jets. According to the company's post on X (formerly Twitter), fans can bring any jersey of a Browns quarterback from 1999-2021 to Dawg Pound Drive, and exchange it for a jersey of either Joe Flacco, Deshaun Watson, Nick Chubb or Myles Garrett free of charge. It's especially ironic that a jersey of Flacco, who went 17-3 in against the Browns during his time with the hated Baltimore Ravens, is being offered. But then again, hard to blame Cleveland fans for taking any sliver of quarterbacking success, no matter where it comes from. The Browns (10-5) host the Jets (6-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday, with Cleveland on the verge of wrapping up a playoff spot .",
