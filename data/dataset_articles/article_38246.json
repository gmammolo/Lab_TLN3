  "text": "[Blueface](https://hiphopdx.com/artist/blueface) has confirmed his single status once again, this time by shooting his shot at a pair of restaurant workers. On Wednesday night (December 27), the Los Angeles native and an unidentified friend picked up food from a drive-thru restaurant. In a video posted to his social media, the 26-year-old could be seen telling the person in the driver’s seat to ask the woman at the window for her number before doing so himself. “How you doin’? Can I get your number?” he said directly to her, prompting her and her coworker to scream out of excitement. “Put your number on the receipt — both of ya’ll […] don’t charge me, baby, get that feed later.” Check out the video below: Blueface flirts with fast food worker at drive-thru: \"Put your number on the receipt\" [https://t.co/3Yh0bOWXIA] [pic.twitter.com/SDExgZxTU0] — HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) [December 28, 2023] While he appears to be moving on, Blueface and [Chrisean Rock](https://hiphopdx.com/artist/chrisean-rock)’s drama continues to reach new heights with each passing day as they are still arguing over who the father of her child truly is. The “Thotiana” rapper stopped by [Local Hood News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IKJjQtB8rw&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fhiphopdx.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) on Christmas Eve, where [he offered more theories about the paternity of her son](https://hiphopdx.com/news/blueface-chrisean-rock-jr-paternity-claim), who he helped raised up until recently. “I think it’s her ex, honestly,” the Southern California native said. “They been known to deal longer than we been known to deal, while we was continuing to deal. I think the baby looks like him. I got kids already so I’m expecting something.” [Blueface claimed that he’s already taken a DNA test that ruled him out of the running to be the father of Chrisean Jr.](https://hiphopdx.com/news/blueface-chrisean-rock-not-father), though he is open to posting the paperwork for a payday. AD LOADING... “It’s been scientifically proven that’s not my child. Swabbed him,” he added. “I got paid to do that first lil issues. If somebody were to pay me $100,000 to show the DNA test, shoot it.” The West Coast rhymer also joked that the baby resembles NBA legend [Charles Barkley](https://hiphopdx.com/news/camron-ja-morant-charles-barkley-spat) more than him.",
