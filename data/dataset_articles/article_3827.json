  "text": "Brooklyn saw a significant drop in shootings and murders in 2023 as overall crime decreased by 5%, officials revealed Friday. There were 337 shooting incidents in the borough this year, compared to 449 in 2022, according to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez. Over the same time period, shooting victims in Brooklyn decreased from 544 to 397. The figures represent a roughly 25% drop in both categories. Murders in Brooklyn in 2023 were also down by 10% compared to 2022, the DA’s office said. “It is gratifying to see the progress we are making in keeping Brooklyn safe,” he said in a statement. “These are not just numbers; these are 150 fewer people suffering gunshot injuries that would have altered their lives forever.” The most improvement was seen in Brooklyn North precincts, especially in Brownsville, where shootings dipped 30% and murders plummeted 67%. East New York, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Greenpoint, Sheepshead Bay, and Coney Island also saw significant declines in shootings. Brooklyn precincts have worked tirelessly to combat gun violence and took down two rival street crews, indicting 32 alleged gang members, including drill rapper Sheff G , who allegedly used his music earnings to “encourage acts of violence.” The DA’s Office also convicted a man who killed a gang rival , which sparked a “cycle of violence between the two groups,” it said. All violent crime, including rape and assault, are down an overall 5.1% compared to 2022. Burglaries also decreased 18.4%, rape is down 6.1%, and robberies declined by 4.2%.",
