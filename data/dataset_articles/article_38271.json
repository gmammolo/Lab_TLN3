  "text": "While we're bracing for the usual cold snap that bites each January and Dunnes Stores is already one step ahead of us.\nIf you can peel your eyes away from the sales for just a moment, we've spotted a gorgeous fleecy half-zip that will keep out the cold - whenever it decides to descend - and it won't break the bank.\nToday's top videos\nThis blue and white abstract printed fleece is currently selling for €15.\nHalf zip fleece, €15. Pic: Dunnes Stores It also comes in a range of other colours like red, and beige, which are on sale for just €10.\nFeaturing a high neck and cuffed sleeves, this layer almost screams snug as it promises to keep out any draughts that may come your way in the new year.\nWe love the raspberry shade. Pic: Dunnes Stores Rosanna Davison previously had style fans racing to the tills for her cool and colourful Dunnes jumper and we can see this style is also selling out fast in cet\nThis piece looks like a great option to layer or wear as a standalone outerwear item, with a pouch pocket at the front for carrying any essentials around with you.\nThe cream fleece is so versatile. Pic: Dunnes Stores Pair this look with leggings for a relaxed look for running errands, or jeans and Chelsea boots to continue with the cosy winter style.",
