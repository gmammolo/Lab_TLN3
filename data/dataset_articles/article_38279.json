  "text": "Maj. Eric Tise, opposing solo pilot for the U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron “Thunderbirds”, performs maneuvers in No. 6 jet during the Cleveland National Air Show at Cleveland, Ohio, Sept. 4, 2023. The Thunderbirds aim to strengthen morale and support community relations by executing difficult aerial performances during airshows and other events. The Thunderbirds headlined the three-day event to demonstrate the pride, precision, and professionalism of nearly 700,000 Total Force Airmen across the globe. The Cleveland National Air Show is one of the oldest and most established annual air shows in the country starting with the National Air Races from 1929 to 1949 and continuing with the current-day air show from 1964 to present day. The air show is held every Labor Day weekend and attracts more than 100,000 spectators to Burke Lakefront Airport located along the shores of Lake Erie. (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Jacob B.
