  "text": "EAST WHITELAND >> Wins have been hard to come by in the early stages of the season for the Great Valley boys basketball team. Thursday afternoon in the opening game of the Great Valley Holiday Tournament, the Patriots put it all together as they overran Lehigh Valley Academy, 55-17, to put the hosts into today’s championship game against Pottstown (who beat Upper Darby 48-44). The Patriots (3-6) shot 24-for-54 from the field and forced 27 Jaguar (1-4) turnovers as they consistently beat the Jaguars down the floor for a plethora of easy baskets in transition. “We ran our offense today and the guys got better,” Great Valley coach CJ Savage said. “We were the better team but we got to work on some things and we needed it because nine of our 13 guys are up from the junior varsity and are just getting used to playing varsity basketball. We did some nice things today.” Great Valley was led by senior center Jake Woodard, who tallied a game-high 20 points to go along with six rebounds. Woodard also drained a couple of three-balls and the Jaguars had no answer for the Patriots big man. The Patriots jetted out to an 18-5 lead in the first period. The Jaguars committed 17 first period turnovers and shot just 1-for-8 from the field in the opening quarter. Woodard and Marquis Alexander scored after Jaguars turnovers to give the Patriots the big first period lead. The Jaguars shot just 6-for-28 from the field for the game. Great Valley salted the game away to start the second period as they went on a 10-0 run to make it a 28-5 game. Will Mack opened the run by getting a backdoor layup. After a Jaguars turnover, Alexander scored inside. The Jaguars misfired on a three-ball and Woodard then took a nice feed from Tyler Markowski to make it a 24-5 game and the rout was on. Noah Metrick scored in transition and the Jaguars were effectively done. “We knew we were the better team but a win is a win,” Woodard said. “But, you always want to get better when you win a game and we ran our offense really well today. We have a lot of guys who are playing varsity basketball for the first time and they are starting to come together and understand when to make a pass and when not to. They are adjusting to the pace of the game at the varsity level.” Great Valley held a 38-9 lead at halftime and the Patriots quickly put the game into the 30 point mercy rule in the third period when Woodard scored in the lane to make the score 40-9. Alexander then scored on a follow, and it was Alexander’s sixth rebound of the game. Savage cleared his bench after Alexander’s basket and the Patriots reserves played the rest of the game. “We worked on our offense out there today,” Alexander said. “We were running our cuts very well and even though we took a big lead early we locked in. Anytime you go between the lines you have to lock in and do your job and we did that today even though we got up big early.” Great Valley 55, Lehigh Valley Academy 17 LEHIGH VALLEY ACADEMY (17) Wilkins 3 3-7 9, Orozco 0 1-2 1, McNeil 2 0-0 5, Haylock 1 0-0 2, Seibert 0 0-0 0, Soriano 0 0-0 0, McArtheu 0 0-0 0.
