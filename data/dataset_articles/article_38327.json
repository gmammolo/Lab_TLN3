  "text": "Through this rose dedication, DHMC recognizes our dedication and commitment to the life-saving and healing generosity of organ and tissue donation. We are grateful to be part of this celebration of life to be viewed by millions on New Year’s Day.Joanne M. Conroy, MD Dartmouth Health’s Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) has partnered with [New England Donor Services](https://neds.org/) to honor and remember those who gave the gift of life through organ and tissue donation. On January 1, 2024, the [Donate Life Rose Parade Float](https://donatelifefloat.org/si/), titled “Woven Together: The Dance of Life,” will include a dedication garden made up of roses with handwritten dedications by transplant hospital CEOs across the country including Joanne M. Conroy, MD, CEO and president of Dartmouth Health. “Through this rose dedication, DHMC recognizes our dedication and commitment to the life-saving and healing generosity of organ and tissue donation,” Conroy said. “We are grateful to be part of this celebration of life to be viewed by millions on New Year’s Day.” Since its debut on New Year’s Day 2004, the Donate Life Rose Parade Float has become the world’s most visible campaign to inspire people to become organ and tissue donors. In addition to the 40 million viewers who watch the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/about/about-rose-parade/) on TV and along the parade route, events are held around the country to complete the “floragraph” images of donors that adorn the float. The “Woven Together: The Dance of Life” float showcases the culture of the Hopi, native to the American Southwest. This group of Pueblo Native Americans is one of the oldest cultures in the United States, originating approximately 7,000 years ago. The Hopi have always been outstanding weavers and artisans, and their dances include colorful costumes and impressive headdresses and will be reflected in the float’s design. As the world’s most visible campaign to inspire organ, eye and tissue donation, the Donate Life Rose Parade float inspires viewers to save and heal more than one million people in need of organ and tissue transplants each year. “I am proud of DHMC’s commitment to organ and tissue donation,” said Michael F. Daily, MD, MS, FACS, section chief of transplant surgery at DHMC. “The ability to help our patients is made possible through this generous gift of life.” Register today to become an organ and tissue donor by visiting [RegisterMe.org](https://registerme.org/).
