  "text": "Foto: Getty Images\nA 13-year-old country music fan has taken the internet by storm with an unsuspecting cover of \"Heart Like A Truck\" by Lainey Wilson . In a jaw-dropping TikTok video, young Rilee belted out the single while receiving a hair cut from viral barber Noah Peters .\nThe shocking clip was shared on thesingingbarber 's TikTok page. Per the account's theme, Barber shop customers sit in the chair and sing a song while they get their hair cut.\n\"Sweet Rilee is only 13-years-old\" the caption reads, \"She has never sang in front of anyone. @LaineyWilson I want you to see this!!!!\" And see it she did! Wilson not only viewed the stellar cover of her hit single, but she also commented on the video.\n\"Let's go!!! Sing it girl.\" The clip soon found its way to other country superstars' For You Pages, and the rest is history. Luke Combs viewed the video of Rilee singing \"Heart Like A Truck\" and commended the young singer for her talents saying, \"You killed that Rilee! Keep it up.\" As if receiving compliments from two standout artists wasn't enough, the one, the only, Jelly Roll also gave Rilee a glowing review.\n\"She sounds incredible to be so young! Tell her to keep chasing that dream, keep singing from the soul young lady!\" The most recent country star comment arrived on Wednesday (December 27) when Morgan Wallen raved, \"She got something special! Keep goin.\"\nAfter only one day on TikTok, the video has garnered a whopping 13.1 million views!",
