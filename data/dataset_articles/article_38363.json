  "text": "These NJ restaurants have both the best pizza and cheesesteaks As you know, I'm a bit of a cheesesteak aficionado. At least in my own head. Either way, I love a good cheesesteak and pizza. Some places have figured out the magic of combining the two. Delicious! When I brought this up on the air, our lines were flooded with calls about local go-to favorites around the Garden State. It's one of the reasons that I'm diggin' in. No way you're getting great pizza and cheesesteaks anywhere else. Here's the extended list for you to check out and hopefully try, at least one place on the list, this weekend! Make sure that if you have friends and family traveling in from other states to visit you for the holidays you don't let 'em leave before trying some delicious Jersey pizza!
