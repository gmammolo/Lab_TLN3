  "text": "3 weird ways to break out of your post-holiday slump\nBrain puzzles, Instagram stories and running roulette: you'll feel revitalized after you tackle any of these unique training sessions\nMystery route roulette\nTurn your run into an adventure, letting chance guide your path. Write down a few of your favourite local\nrunning routes and distances on pieces of paper, throw them into a hat, and draw one before a run. The element of surprise will inject some excitement into your run while making the outing a unique exploration.\nRun-doku challenge\nCombine the brain-teasing challenge of Sudoku with a\nfantastic fartlek workout. Before your run, solve a Sudoku puzzle (there are lots of beginner ones online). Choose one of the nine grids on the Sudoku puzzle to use as inspiration for your training session.\nAs you run, follow the Sudoku pattern and change your pace or focus based on the corresponding numbers. Sprint during “5” segments, jog during “2” segments, and so on. This creative twist adds a mental aspect to your run, making it a dynamic and entertaining challenge.\nInstagrammable running challenge\nTap into\nyour creative side by turning your run into an Instagram scavenger hunt—bonus points if you can rope some friends into competing against you (or running with you). Set a goal to find and photograph specific items during your run—a red door, a street sign with your name on it, a specific model of car, a maple tree, a pickup truck with a snowplow on the front, someone wearing a pink hat, or even a friendly neighborhood cat.\nSharing your unique finds on social media can transform your run into a fun visual story to look back on for inspiration whenever you don’t feel like putting on your shoes.",
