  "text": "Jon Pardi Reveals He's '112 Days Sober' After He 'Retired' from Alcohol: 'I Was So Unhappy with Myself' The country star said he's \"lost a bunch of weight\" since giving up alcohol [Jon Pardi](https://people.com/tag/jon-pardi/) is entering 2024 making strides in his newfound sobriety journey. The \"Ain't Always the Cowboy\" singer, 38, appeared on Amazon Music's [Country Heat Weekly](https://music.amazon.com/podcasts/8b0cf1f8-ea72-4ee7-ad89-39ec6474ee87/episodes/79cc5275-9fac-4719-bbec-63946731cb26/country-heat-weekly-jon-pardi's-christmas-party)podcast and revealed that he’s nearly four months sober, and has lost some weight because of the lifestyle change. \"I've been 112 days sober. I’ve lost a bunch of weight,\" the country star told hosts Kelly Sutton and Amber Anderson. \"I was pre-diabetic, and I was just like, 'I gotta stop.'\" Pardi explained that his weight ultimately left him feeling \"unhappy\" and drove him to make the decision. \"I was really getting to the point where every picture, every video I was so unhappy with myself,\" he admitted. \"And where I was going, I needed to just take a break.\" Never miss a story — sign up for [PEOPLE's free daily newsletter](https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline) to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

'Damn, I look good,' Take that Tito's!\" he said with a laugh. \"But for anybody that's thinking about it, if they want to lose weight and you do drink, let me tell you, it does help tremendously if you stop.\" The \"Last Night Lonely\" singer then teased on the show that although he gave up alcohol, his sweet tooth is still his weakness. \"I love me some ice cream,\" he quipped. \"I'm like, 'Well, I'm not drinking. I better get this Twix candy ice cream.’ Coffee ice cream. So good.\" Although Pardi didn’t give anymore insight on his sobriety journey, he noted that he’s not sure if he’ll stay committed to it. \"I'm retired, OK? Doesn't mean I can't come out of retirement,\" he said. \"But for right now, it's been great.\" For more People news, make sure to [sign up for our newsletter!](https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-apple-news-opt-in) Read the original article on [People](https://people.com/jon-pardi-is-112-days-sober-after-he-retired-from-alcohol-8420724).",
