  "text": "The Arcata Tigers boys team started the Bambauer Classic on Wednesday with a nice team performance that saw the Tigers get a 93-81 win over Lincoln High in a high-scoring affair. Arcata made the trip to Marin County and got above .500 (6-5) on the season with the win over the short-handed Lincoln Zebras team that played with only six players, leaving just one reserve on the Zebra bench. Lincoln also came out with a noticeable strategy, to let the three balls fly. The Zebras did their best to stretch the floor and play the numbers with the three-point shots but sophomore Luke Lemke and senior Kalani Butor had no interest in seeing Arcata enter the loser’s side of the bracket. The duo combined for over 50 points and controlled the pace for the Tigers. The Lemke-Butor pairing usually isn’t the headline for the Tigers, the team had both league co-MVPs last season with junior Luke Moxen and the graduated Brandon Bento-Jackson sharing the honor for the Big 5 champion Tigers. Moxen started the game great for Arcata, scoring the game’s first bucket for the Tigers and displayed his all-around game with post moves, a block, his ability to put the ball on the ground and make plays and even knocking down a three-ball. Moxen’s performance was short-lived as early in the third quarter Moxen had to leave the game with a lower-body injury. He appeared to attempt to walk it off but then got treatment for it on the Tigers’ bench and did not return to the game. While losing the top scorer would be too much to overcome for many teams, Arcata had the depth to keep pushing and building a lead. Arcata had several contributors in the third quarter. After Moxen went down, junior Finn Warner hit a three, sophomore Jack Luh soared for an offensive rebound and put back lay-in and junior Dawson Vallerga had back-to-back layups to help Arcata take a 67-52 lead into the fourth. Even with all of the help from Arcata’s supporting cast, it was Butor with his high-release point on his jumpers and Lemke pacing up-and-down the court that buried Lincoln. Butor was able to consistently get to the line to disrupt any Lincoln momentum while Lemke seemingly played at a whole different speed than the fatigued Zebra defense that had to play heavy minutes with limited rotation. Lemke took home Little 4 offensive MVP for the Tigers’ football team earlier this year but he still looked in mid-season form on the court. In the second half, he took the game over for Arcata. He sliced through the Lincoln defense with such ease, one might think the defenders spent the day readying for the game in a crockpot. Lemke found open teammates, knocked down free throws and punctuated his run with a step-back three that felt like a dagger even with plenty of time still on the clock. Lincoln won the fourth quarter 29-26 — impressive considering the fatigue level with all of their players seeing such heavy minutes but it was not enough as the Tigers won it 93-81. Arcata is back at it on Thursday as they’ll face the host team, Marin Catholic in the late game, with tip-off set for 8 p.m. Dylan McNeill can be reached at 707-441-0526.",
