  "text": "Happy (nearly) new year — I hope you had a wonderful and magical holiday season!\n2023 has been an incredible year full of very high-highs, and some lows as well. We really hunkered down in 2020 and much of 2021, so this felt like our first year of getting back into the swing of things travel-wise, which was a real highlight. As a family we visited San Diego, Vail, Denver, Albuquerque, Minneapolis, and the Gulf Shores (take me back!) Professionally, I was lucky enough to travel to Austin, Washington DC, Nashville, and the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee.\nThis was the first year we’ve been able to travel without a lot of extra “stuff” that comes with having babies and toddlers (pack ‘n’ plays, diapers, bottles, etc.) which felt very strange (“why do we have so much extra trunk space?!” — me after packing the car up for a road trip, lol) and freeing.\nThat said, to my Mamas of itty bitty ones — time FLIES and before you know it you’ll be trading 2am feedings with 2pm coastal-mountain hikes. Hang in there! <3\nIn 2023 we said goodbye to beloved family members, and are getting ready to meet new family members in 2024. We all got Covid for the first time this past spring (10/10 do not recommend) and I worked through some debilitating health issues this fall that are thankfully, finally, resolving. I enter 2024 determined to never take good health for granted.\nAs a friend recently said, health is wealth!\nAll that said, I am so excited to enter a new year and see how my kids learn and grow, where life takes us, and of course dish up another delicious year of easy gluten recipes using everyday ingredients here on Iowa Girl Eats!\nWhich brings me to my favorite post of the year — a recap of YOUR favorite new recipes as determined by clicks, views and shares! These include\nhealthy spins on heavier recipes, my boys’ favorite breakfast, my personal favorite recipe from 2023, and this viral recipe.\nAs we head into 2024, I want to hear from you: what kinds of recipes are you looking for? How can I help?\nLastly, are you signed up for my free email list? If not, sign up! It’s an easy way to stay in touch. :)\nTop Recipes from Previous Years\nTop 10 in 2022 Top 10 in 2021 Top 10 in 2020 Top 10 in 2019 Top 10 in 2018 Top 10 in 2017 Top 10 in 2016 Top 10 in 2015\nTop 10 Reader Favorite Recipes in 2023\n#1 Crock Pot Buffalo Chicken Dip\nThis\nexisting recipe got a much needed photo upgrade in 2023 and it exploded in popularity afterwards (what can I say, photographing orange food is very, very hard!) Equal parts spicy, cheesy, and creamy, it is addictingly delicious.\n#2 Baked Chicken Thighs\nThere’s always a recipe that goes viral on IGE each year, and in 2023 it was\nBaked Chicken Thighs. (In 2022 it was the Jennifer Aniston Salad, in 2021 it was Gnocchi Chicken Pot Pie, and in 2020 it was Cheeseburger Quesadillas, ICYWW!) I make this recipe almost weekly because its insanely easy and my family demolishes the entire pan with rave reviews each and every time.\n#3 Perfect Gluten Free Pancakes\nAny time I get a new review on my\nPerfect Gluten Free Pancakes I do a little dance. It’s uncommon that a non-savory recipe cracks the top 10 most popular recipes each year, which is a testament to how fantastic these pancakes are.\n#4 High Protein Overnight Oats\n2023 was the year of protein. Everywhere I turned — whether it be social media, magazines, or the news — the benefits of protein-packed meals were being touted.\nHigh Protein Overnight Oats kind of feels like cheating because they’re packed with protein yet taste like cake and require zero protein powder or uncommon ingredients. Truly the most perfect breakfast or snack idea.\n#5 Mini Egg Bites\nMini Egg Bites were another crazy popular, high-protein breakfast / snack recipe in 2023. This recipe also contains an ingredient that had itself an entire MOMENT in 2023. Can you guess what it is?\n#6 Chickpea Chicken Salad\nInexpensive, full of plant-based-protein, healthy, crunchy, and fresh are all words I’d use to describe the sixth most popular recipe in 2023.\nChickpea “Chicken” Salad tastes like regular chicken salad except it’s completely vegan. My Dad — who I’m not sure had ever looked at a chickpea before this recipe — makes it every single week for lunch, if that tells you how tasty it is!\n#7 Gluten Free Pizza Crust\nThe comments I routinely get on my\nGluten Free Pizza Crust recipe are why I do what I do. Reading: “Thank you for saving pizza night!!” or “My husband looked at me and said, “This tastes just like real pizza!””, and “I am in tears … these little wins mean the world” thrill me to hear. Food is so emotional and to be able to help my fellow g-free-ers with a pizza crust recipe that tastes like “regular” hand tossed pizza was definitely a highlight of 2023.\n#8 Gluten Free Cornbread\nI grew up eating Jiffy cornbread mix and this homemade\nGluten Free Cornbread recipe is a dead ringer — I’m so glad it cracked the top 10 in 2023 despite being shared just a month or two ago! The perfect thing to pair with chili, soups, and BBQ.\n#9 Gluten Free Focaccia\nGluten Free Focaccia is your 9th favorite recipe from 2023, and my personal favorite recipe from 2023. Words cannot describe how meaningful it is to have a recipe for soft and fluffy gluten free bread that calls for a handful of everyday ingredients. If there’s one recipe I urge you to make from this list, it’s Gluten Free Focaccia!\n#10 Gluten Free Strawberry Muffins\nI’m not a huge sweets girl so trust me when I tell you that the recipe for\nGluten Free Strawberry Muffins is utter perfection. Just the right amount of sweetness, soft and fluffy — I lost track of how many batches I made this summer during peak strawberry season. Feel free to swap in other berries, as the base muffin recipe is just fantastic!\nWishing you a happy, safe, and healthy 2024 — thank you from the bottom of my heart for visiting me here at Iowa Girl Eats, and cooking my recipes!",
