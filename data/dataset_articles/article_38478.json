  "text": "Coronation Street actress Channique Sterling-Brown has stunned soap fans as she revealed a surprise Emmerdale link.\nThe actress, 26, joined the hit ITV soap back in 2022 as loveable Dee-Dee Bailey. Channique appeared on Thursday's ITV special, The Big Soap Quiz: Coronation Street v Emmerdale .\nChannique was joined by her Coronation Street co-stars, Tony Maudsley, who plays George Shuttleworth, and Jack P Shepherd, who plays David Platt. During the episode, host Stephen Mulhern asked Channique: \"By the way, a little birdie tells me that you could of actually been on the other team tonight, is that right?\" in a nod to Emmerdale's team, made up of Natalie Ann Jamieson, who plays Amy Wyatt, Kevin Mathurin, who plays Charles Anderson, and Mark Charnock, who plays Marlon Dingle.\nChannique admitted: \"I could have been your daughter, Kevin!\" to which Emmerdale star Kevin replied: \"You're kidding!\" Stephen then explained: \"She auditioned\" to which Channique replied: \"Didn't get the job!\" Kevin then responded: \"Oh well, it all happens for a good reason!\" to which Stephen quipped: \"Kevin seems gutted about that, literally he went: 'Oh well!'\", leaving the actor in hysterics.\nSoap watchers will recall that Karene Peter landed the role of Kevin's character, Charles Anderson's daughter Naomi Walters. Naomi made her first village debut back in July 2022 and left in July this year to live in Ibiza.\nTaking to Twitter , now X, after Channique revealed she could have been on Emmerdale, one person said: \"#Corrie Star Channique Sterling Brown has revealed she auditioned for the role of Naomi Walters in #Emmerdale!\" while a different account added: \"Dee Dee from #Corrie could have been Charles from #Emmerdale daughter! #BigSoapQuiz!\"\nElsewhere during the episode, actor Tony revealed why soap bosses will never kill off his character George Shuttleworth. Host Stephen asked Tony how is life for his character George in Weatherfield. To which Tony quipped: \"Well, business is booming as always in Weatherfield. The best thing about playing George is, they can't kill me off because there's no one to bury me! So yeah, I'm staying put, me!\"\nBack in 2020 after it was announced Tony would be joining the cobbles as George, the actor said at the time on Twitter , now X: \"Yes I can indeed confirm this to be true. I’m chuffed to be staying at my ITV home and heading to Weatherfield and I for one, couldn’t be happier. As a long time fan of Coronation Street I’m thrilled to be joining the cast of my favourite show. Here’s to the next exciting chapter.\"\nCoronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and ITV X. * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",
