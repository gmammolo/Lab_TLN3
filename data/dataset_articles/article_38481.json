  "text": "DAYTON, Ohio (WKEF) -- Jeff Schmitt Auto Group announced Donna Ruff as its 2023 Jeff's Hero in recognition of her commitment to the animal community through Ruff Rescue Transport. Ruff Rescue Transport, which was established in 2015, has helped nearly 15,000 cats and dogs. The organization provides critical transportation for animals in distress, ensuring their safe journey to shelters and dedicated volunteers. Throughout 2023 there were four finalists announced for the Jeff’s Heroes initiative. Each finalist received a check for $5,000 from Jeff Schmitt Auto Group to help support their impact in the community. Voting was opened to anyone to pick their favorite Jeff's Hero beginning in December. After thousands of votes, Donna was selected as the winner. The award for the 2023 Jeff’s Hero was planned to be $10,000 cash and up to $20,000 towards a new vehicle. After speaking with Ruff, it was learned that her vehicle needs were already being met, so a check was presented to her for $30,000. \"Donna Ruff and Ruff Rescue Transport are doing amazing things to help thousands of animals in need,\" said Jay Schmitt, president of the Jeff Schmitt Auto Group. \"My wife and I adopted our dog Maya from the Humane Society of Greater Dayton in March. It was only after meeting Donna for the first time that I learned that she helped transport Maya and her littermates from a kill-shelter in Kentucky all the way up to Dayton where they could find their forever homes. Congratulations to Donna, and to all of the Jeff’s Heroes finalists that I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know this year.” More about Donna and the Jeff's Hero initiative can be found at [www.jeffdeals.com](https://www.jeffdeals.com/jeffs-heroes/).
