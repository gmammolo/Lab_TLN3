Providing lights, cooling classrooms and a computer lab.” — Kevin Keene - Founder, Brighten Haiti SANTA ROSA, CA, USA, In a landmark collaboration, Lycée Philippe-Guerrier, one of Haiti's most storied educational institutions, is set to receive a significant upgrade to its infrastructure. The Santa Rosa Sunrise Rotary Club , West Seattle Rotary Club, and the Cap-Haitien Rotary Club have joined forces with Brighten Haiti to install a cutting-edge solar energy system at the school.\nThis solar project, executed by Brighten Haiti and its skilled Solar Apprentices, is a game-changer for the 180-year-old Lycée Philippe-Guerrier. It signifies the first time in its long history that the school will have stable electricity and computer labs, crucial for modern education.\nThis initiative underscores the commitment of the involved Rotary clubs and Brighten Haiti to foster sustainable development and improve educational infrastructure in Haiti. The solar installation not only promises a brighter, more efficient learning environment for the students but also serves as a shining example of the positive impact of international cooperation and renewable energy in transforming communities.\nJoin us in celebrating this exceptional milestone, a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in making a significant difference in the lives of young learners.\nFor more information, please contact Kevin Keene Founder, Brighten Haiti kevin.keene@brightenhaiti.org 503.332.9029.\nAbout Lycée Philippe-Guerrier:\nFounded in 1844, Lycée Philippe-Guerrier is one of Haiti's oldest and most prestigious academic institutions, with a legacy of educational excellence.\nAbout the Partners:\nBrighten Haiti, the Santa Rosa Sunrise Rotary Club, West Seattle Rotary Club, and the Cap-Haitien Rotary Club are committed to promoting sustainable solutions and education in Haiti as part of their ongoing humanitarian efforts.
