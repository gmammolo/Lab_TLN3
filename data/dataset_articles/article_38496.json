Fairgoers can expect fun, new flavors and exciting events ahead that celebrate 100 years of baking and serving cream puffs. Specialty cream puffs will be available for pre-order to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. The flavors will be announced at a future date, but mark your calendars for the March 15-17 drive-thru event.
