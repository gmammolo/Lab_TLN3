  "text": "The Sphere continues to be the most viral entertainment venue in the world, but U2 has nothing on Taylor Swift when it comes to ticket sales in 2023! She dominated StubHub.\nAs it does each December, the ticket exchange and resale company released its year-end\nreport earlier this month. It called Las Vegas “the poster child for the year’s momentum in live entertainment” and compared cumulative tickets sales for events in the city over the last 12 months.\nSwift played just two shows at Allegiant Stadium, home of the Raiders. Her lack of performances did not matter. The Eras Tour still topped StubHub’s list of top-selling events in\nLas Vegas in 2023.\nShe surpassed the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which took place in November. Formula 1’s first-ever race in Sin City was the second best-selling event to take place in Nevada’s adult playground. 315,000 fans attended the four-day event, which also made it the third best-selling sporting event in the entire world.\nSwift surpassed that mark!\nComing in at No. 3 was U2’s Achtung Baby residency at\nthe Sphere. It drew ticket buyers from 91 different countries and all 50 states. Had the Sphere opened before the end of September, it might have come closer to the Grand Prix and Swift.\nDespite the short-lived calendar, the Sphere out-sold the When We Were Young Festival at the Las Vegas Festival Grounds. That was No. 4.\nThe NFL game between the Raiders and Steelers on Sept. 24 came in at No. 5. Believe it or not, Las Vegas’ pro football team actually out-sold the Dallas Cowboys by 17 percent!\nAll of this goes to say that\nTaylor Swift is queen. She held the vast majority of the Top 10 across the entire country. Not even the Sphere — which is all of the rage on social media — could come close to touching the Swifties!",
