  "text": "In anticipation of the significant demand for the consecration ceremony of the newly built Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, the Ambala Division of Railways has revealed plans to operate special trains from Amritsar, Bathinda, and Chandigarh to Ayodhya. The consecration of Ram Lalla is scheduled to take place on January 22, prompting preparations to accommodate devotees who prefer rail travel. Ambala Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Mandeep Bhatia stated, “Most people prefer to travel by railway, for which the Railways have also made their preparations. Special trains for Ayodhya can run from Amritsar, Bathinda, and Chandigarh, the schedule of which will be released soon. Extra counters can also be set up for tickets.” Regarding ticketing, DRM Bhatia mentioned, “Although 80 per cent of people are inclined towards e-ticketing in which people get the facility sitting at home, extra counters can also be set up if needed.” The consecration ceremony, scheduled to start on January 16 and span seven days, will witness the opening of the Ram Mandir to the public and the consecration of Lord Sri Ram’s idol. Ayodhya is set to be connected to various regions and cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, Kolkata, Nagpur, Lucknow, and Jammu, to facilitate travel for devotees. In addition to the railway preparations, the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) is gearing up to provide round-the-clock catering services to meet the needs of the large number of pilgrims visiting Ayodhya during this period. For enhanced security during the January 22 event, officials have planned the installation of boom barriers, bollards, and CCTV cameras at all entrances of the Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya. Boom barriers, or tyre killers, are devices designed to prevent unauthorized vehicles from entering a property. The security measures aim to ensure a safe and organized environment for the consecration ceremony.",
