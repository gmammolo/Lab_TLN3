  "text": "A team from Tufts and Harvard universities have managed to develop small biological robots from human tracheal cells that can move across a surface and stimulate the growth of neurons, at least in a laboratory dish. According to the research published on the portal of the [Tufts University](https://now.tufts.edu/2023/11/30/scientists-build-tiny-biological-robots-human-cells), which range in size from the width of a human hair to the tip of a sharp pencil, were made to self-assemble and were shown to have a remarkable healing effect on other cells. According to the portal, the discovery is a starting point for researchers' vision of using patient-derived biobots as new therapeutic tools for regeneration, healing and treating diseases. In the study, also replicated by the Minister of Science and Technology, [Gabriela Jimenez](https://twitter.com/Gabrielasjr/status/1740087268998574212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1740087268998574212%7Ctwgr%5E02d2c381e434e6cdd5f6dfcb305f0bcb719e70df%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fultimasnoticias.com.ve%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2696325action%3Dedit), the authors discovered that the cells could not only create new multicellular shapes, but were also able to move in different ways on a surface of human neurons grown in a laboratory dish, and stimulate new growth to fill gaps caused by injury. . Likewise, the study suggests that among the advantages of using human cells is the possibility of building robots from the patient's own cells to carry out therapeutic work without the risk of triggering an immune response or requiring immunosuppressants.",
