STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ The 1964 Greenfield state cross country championship team coach Peter Conway and his team at their 60th anniversary celebration at Terrazza on Thursday. STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ GREENFIELD — State championship teams tend to be tight-knit groups that compete for one another. That mentality defined the 1964 Greenfield cross country team. That 1964 team — which consisted of Dave Ciszewski, Dennis Bates, Jon Thompson, John Kaczenski, George Platek, Mike Belleau, Steve Kelleher, Ed Haseltine, Verne Sunde and Dennis Tetreault and was coached by Pete Conway — had plenty of talented runners who wanted to compete for one another. That led to an undefeated season and culminated in a state championship, the first state championship ever achieved by a Greenfield High School team. Now 60 years later, that team got together on Thursday at Terrazza in Greenfield to celebrate their accomplishments. With seven runners from that team — Ciszewski, Kaczenski, Belleau, Platek, Kelleher, Thompson and Sunde — as well as Conway being there for the reunion, coming from all over to be there, it shows just how close that group was. “It was so much fun,” Conway said. “It was great to have so many of them there. Some had to travel some way to get there while some were lucky to still be nearby. I’m 90 now and they’re in their 70s. I’m glad it happened and that we were all able to enjoy it.” The reunion saw stories and memories swapped and greetings from those who haven’t seen each other in a long time. Many former Greenfield cross country and track greats were also in attendance. For Conway, the ’64 team was a special one simply because it was the first team he had ever coached. After trying to start a cross country team at Turners Falls, Conway was offered a job at Greenfield and accepted, starting the cross country program while also teaching at the school. It didn’t take him long to realize what a talented group of runners he had to work with. “I knew they were a state championship caliber group,” Conway said. “The team had so much talent. I could sense it early because I had just finished running at UMass and had been competing in road races. As soon as we started they were doing workouts that I would do as a college runner. Within a week I knew I had something special.” When the first-year coach saw the potential, he made sure to work them. Going back to when he would run at Springfield College, Conway had seen the motto of the Springfield team was the triangle: mind, body and spirit. Conway talked to the team about how the mind can control the body, but that spirit isn’t just laughing and having a good time, it’s about encompassing your emotions and pushing forward even when your body and mind are telling you to stop. “I incorporated everything I believed in and taught that to the team,” Conway said. “If you are good at something and want to share it, that’s what you should do. That was my first year so I really tried to pass that message down to them so not only would they take that into cross country, but they would take those values and messages into their lives forever. “Seeing them today brought back a lot of memories,” Conway said. “They know how hard I used to push them. You don’t become a champion without being pushed. You don’t become a champion by just singing songs while running down the road.” The ’64 Green Wave team would run 10, 11 or 12 miles every week, sticking to Conway’s workouts which he would document in a book (one he brought with him on Thursday to the reunion), which he made extra hard to get the most out of his runners. The results showed, as Greenfield didn’t come close to losing a meet all season, including a decisive win in the state championship meet. “The runners on that team never got beat by anybody,” Conway said. “We would have 10 guys running and all 10 would finish before the first person on the other team would. Every meet the score would be 15-50 us. We won the Valley League and went unbeaten.” As a first-year coach, Conway learned on the job. Having a group of dedicated runners made his life much easier. “I was learning how to observe, incorporate and change things on the fly,” Conway said. “I would change the workouts for each kid to get the most out of them.” Conway credits the attitude and how well the team listened for their success. “They had an attitude that they would be the best,” Conway said. “That makes it easy for me. We were a close-knit group. We ran so well because we were all together.They all knew they had a job to do and they had to take it on their own to accomplish it. It was never just about doing your best. If I posted a workout, they were going to accomplish it. They ran hard for me.” Conway, who still coaches track at Greenfield, credits his late wife, Patti, for helping with the team and keeping him focused in his first year coaching. “I couldn’t have done it without her,” Conway said. “I had to stop and collect myself [Thursday] when I told them how much her support meant to me and the team. It wouldn’t have been possible without her.” Conway also credited Sunde for coming up with the idea of the reunion and planning it. “All the credit goes to Verne Sunde for today,” Conway said. “Verne talked about a reunion months ago. He contacted the ’64 team and they all wanted to come if they could. The plans developed from there. He was the spark plug behind it. I can’t take any credit for it. “It felt necessary to recognize people were 60 years ago were part of a state championship winning team. I’m glad we did it.” SOUTH DEERFIELD — Tree House Brewing Co. has been given the go-ahead to more than triple its occupancy for the upcoming season, pending public...
