The man, who goes by the username michaeldonnelly, wrote about the incident earlier this month on [“Am I The A**hole?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/18j0r9o/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_airline_seat_to_a/) Reddit forum, [The Independent reported](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/plane-seat-swap-pregnant-woman-b2470275.html). The Redditor says he was solo on the five-hour flight to see his family for the holidays. He explained in his post that he paid extra for an aisle seat near the restroom because he has a medical condition that sometimes requires quick access to the bathroom. “Right before boarding, a woman asked me to give up my seat so she could sit closer to the bathroom. She was pregnant but did not seem distressed,” he wrote, adding that even though he empathized with her, he thought it was unfair for him to give up his seat. “While I felt for her situation, as someone with a medical condition, I did not feel it was fair to demand I move from the seat I planned for and paid for, especially since she apparently had not booked an aisle seat herself in advance,” he wrote. He added that the flight attendants “refused to help mediate” the situation and that there were no other aisle seats or seats close to the bathroom were available on a full flight.

The flight attendants are at fault for not meditating. At some point, they should have told her to go back to her seat.” Another Reddit user commented: “I say this as someone who has been pregnant and has flown solo with a toddler… every passenger has equal opportunity to pre-book seats based on their needs and preferences.” One commentator said that the woman was entitled because she was pregnant, [according to the New York Post.](https://nypost.com/2023/12/27/news/man-praised-online-for-refusing-to-swap-seats-with-pregnant-lady/) “She thought she could use that to her advantage. But, she found out she couldn’t. And rightfully so OP!!! You booked and paid for that seat,” they said.
