STAFF PHOTO/PAUL FRANZ GREENFIELD — A Bernardston woman is starting 2024 with a nest egg after winning $1 million on a Massachusetts State Lottery ticket she bought at the Greenfield Lodge of Elks 1296 on Christmas Eve. Vicki Sumner purchased a Billion Dollar Extravaganza scratch ticket for $50 and claimed her prize on Dec. 26. According to the Massachusetts State Lottery’s website, she opted to receive her winnings in a one-time payment of $650,000, before taxes, with plans to use some of the money to pay off her car loan and “have some fun.” Attempts by the Greenfield Recorder to contact Sumner were unsuccessful. Tim Herzig, treasurer of the Greenfield Elks, said Sumner’s husband, Mike Duprey, is a member of the fraternal order. He said this is the first substantial winning ticket sold by the lodge at 3 Church St., which also offers Keno. The fraternal organization will receive a $10,000 bonus for selling the winning ticket. Herzig said that money will help the Elks make charitable contributions to American Legion baseball, girls softball, scholarships and other causes.
