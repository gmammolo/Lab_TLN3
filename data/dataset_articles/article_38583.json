Additionally, the first 100 customers can enjoy buy-one-get-one scoops throughout the day , along with exciting extras like raffles, swag, and a DJ, starting from noon on Saturday.\nDrew Belcher , Kevin Whelan and Timothy Dang founded Sorry, Not Sorry in March 2022 at 9484 W. Flamingo Road, Suite 165. They later expanded to a second location inside We All Scream at 517 E. Fremont St. in September, with plans for a Centennial Hills site launching in early 2024.\nThis creamery prides itself on delivering quality , with winter seasonal offerings such as milk and cookies, gingerbread crunch, cherry amaretto chip, and spiced eggnog sugar cookie.
