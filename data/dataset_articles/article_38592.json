  "text": "The second half of the 2023/24 campaign looks set to be an exciting one for Derby County and supporters can back Paul Warne’s side every step of the way with a second half subscription to the official matchday programme. With a dozen Sky Bet League One fixtures remaining at Pride Park Stadium between January and April 2024, including the visit of current top six-sides Bolton Wanderers, Peterborough United and Stevenage, as well as welcoming near neighbours Burton Albion in January, what could be better for the Derby-mad member of your family than the gift that keeps on giving well into the new year. All of the A5 size 52-page editions of ‘The Ram’ are dispatched first class before the day of the game - although this is not a guaranteed pre-event service - and are packed with exclusive player features, opinion columns and historical reads. So get signed up now for just £66 via the club’s official publishing partners Ignition Sports Media at: [ignitionsportsmedia.com/collections/derby-county-1/products/derby-county-second-half-season-subscription-2023-24](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/vbdICBBAPcLLGrCzw4Wi?domain=ignitionsportsmedia.com)",
