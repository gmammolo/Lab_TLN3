  "text": "It may not have been how he envisioned his first goal at the Emirates, but Konstantinos Mavropanos was happy all the same. The Greece international doubled [West Ham](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/west-ham-fc)'s lead with a bullet header on Thursday as the Hammers won 2-0 in north London. A [controversial Tomas Soucek opener](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/soucek-goal-var-ham-arsenal-31764601) put David Moyes' men ahead as the derby underdogs inflicted a first home defeat of the campaign upon [Mikel Arteta](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/mikel-arteta)'s side. But there was no VAR review required for Mavropanos' decisive finish from a James Ward-Prowse corner. Two of West Ham's summer signings combined to cement arguably their biggest result of the season to date, pushing the Hammers up to sixth in the [Premier League](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/premier-league).

Another responded: \"As someone who only made eight appearances for [Arsenal](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/arsenal-fc) surely he's allowed to celebrate more?\" The goal came almost exactly four years after Mavropanos made the last of his eight first-team appearances as a Gunner. The Athens native moved to the Emirates from Greek club PAS Giannina in 2018 and spent four years on their books before joining Stuttgart permanently. Where will West Ham finish in the Premier League this season? Let us know in the [comments section](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/west-ham-arsenal-goal-mavropanos-31764944#comments-section) below. Three seasons with the [Bundesliga](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/bundesliga) club (two of which were on loan) were enough to convince West Ham of his talents. Moyes' side spent around £20million to bring the 26-year-old back to England this past summer, and the signs have been encouraging during his first six months at the club.

Thirteen proved to be his lucky number after netting his first senior goal in English football at the 13th attempt. And Hammers fans are sure to back their man for more minutes after being in and out of Moyes' XI so far this campaign. At the very least, the 24-cap Greece international has cemented a spot in West Ham history after a starring role in the club's first win at the Emirates since 2015. And he'll solidify that status all the more if he's able to ensure West Ham qualify for Europe once again this season.",
