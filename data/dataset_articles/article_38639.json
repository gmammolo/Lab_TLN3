Sport 1 week ago He has also now scored at each of the venues in SA where he has played a Test match.\nThis performance will live long in his memory.\nThursday dawned brightly, with play able to start at the scheduled 10am for the first time in the match.\nThe ball continued to play tricks off the surface with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Siraj able to get even a 70-over old ball to jag off the pitch past the outside edge, while the inconsistent bounce had Elgar troubled occasionally, especially one from Siraj that kept low.\nWith him, Marco Jansen looked increasingly confident as he notched up a second Test 50, which he turned into a highest score in this format by the interval of 72 not out.\nHis driving was impressive, especially through the cover region, while his defence was also rock solid.\nIndia had many moments: balls from Bumrah and Siraj beat the outside edge, while Ravi Ashwin found the edge of Jansen’s bat, but KL Rahul couldn’t react quickly enough to take the chance.\nFive top plays from another enthralling day’s Test cricket The Proteas are edging an advantage after two days' play in the first Test against India in Centurion. TimesLIVE identifies the top five plays of the ... Sport 1 week ago Jansen and Elgar added 111 runs for the sixth wicket, before Elgar’s innings was ended by Thakur.\nTwice in Elgar’s innings, once on Wednesday and then on Thursday morning, he had gloved a short ball in the gap between the wicketkeeper and slip for four, and on a third occasion, the ball glanced the glove, giving Rahul an easy catch.\nGerald Coetzee swung lustily for his 19 off 18 balls, until trying his luck one too many times and lifting Ashwin to Siraj at mid-off.\nJansen’s innings has already lasted 120 balls and included nine fours and a six, and with the pitch continuing to show signs of inconsistency, any runs SA can eke out of the last few wickets will prove invaluable.\nThere was still no sign of whether skipper Temba Bavuma, who is undergoing treatment for a hamstring strain will bat, but it might be worth the risk given that batting will only get harder as the match unfolds.",
