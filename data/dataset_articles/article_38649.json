  "text": "Strictly Come Dancing's Graziano Di Prima has shared a sweet snap with his wife Giada Linda, after being apart for three months due to work commitments. The 29 year old dancer revealed he had flown back to Italy to reunite with his wife, 32, and they enjoyed a spa day together. In the photo, Graziano is seen giving Giada a kiss while they both wear white robes. He captioned the Instagram post: 'Special Day just for us.' The couple spent [Christmas](https://www.ok.co.uk/latest/christmas) at their family home and looked very happy as they danced together in a video shared by Graziano. \"Finally after 3 months apart I'm back with my (other) half,\" he wrote in the caption. When a fan asked if Giada would stay in Sicily while he toured the UK, Graziano – who was partnered with Zara McDermott on the most recent series of Strictly – said she would be joining him. His fans were over the moon to see the couple reunited. One fan gushed: \"My favourite, so good to see you back together xxx Happy New Year to you both.\" Another follower chimed in: \"So happy to see you both together! Reunited at last.\" Graziano is all set for his first solo tour, My Life On Stage, which kicks off on 3rd March and wraps up on 12th April. He'll be dancing his way through cities like Glasgow, Southampton, Stirling, and Chelmsford. Sharing a sweet collection of childhood snaps on Instagram, he announced: \"This is one of the moments that I have worked my whole life for... my very own tour. I wanted to share my life and my journey in the only way I know... through dance.\" He continued: \"Beside me I will have the best partner in dance and in life, my wife and leading lady @giada.lini. I hope to see you there and I want to show that no matter where you come from and who you are, no one can hold you back from achieving your dreams.\". The lovebirds said 'I do' last year in a studding wedding ceremony in Sicily. They exchanged vows in a traditional Catholic ceremony in Graziano's local church with 200 guests. Recalling their special day, Giada told OK!: \"Graziano used to bring me to the castle gate when we first started dating and he didn't have a car, only a Vespa.\" \"I used to reach my hand inside the gate to see if we could get into the castle but it was always locked. We never imagined then that we'd have the money to rent it for our wedding. Sicily was the perfect location to remind us of how it all began.\" * This article was crafted with the help of an AI engine, which speeds up OK!'s editorial research and applies it to article templates created by journalists in our newsrooms.
