  "text": "Cherry Hill, New Jersey - Picture this: a Medford Girl Scout troop, who by the way are not your average cookie sellers, transform themselves into elves as the sun sets. They're on a mission, a sweet one. Armed with bundles of candy canes, these young Girl Scouts sneak around local neighborhoods, planting a forest of candy canes in people's yards. It's a unique twist on holiday cheer, something you don't see every day! Girl Scouts bring their dreams to life and work together to build a better world. Through programs, Girl Scouts of all backgrounds and abilities can be unapologetically themselves as they discover their strengths and rise to meet new challenges—whether they want to climb to the top of a tree or the top of their class, lace up their boots for a hike or advocate for climate justice, or make their first best friends. Backed by trusted adult volunteers, mentors, and millions of alums, Girl Scouts lead the way as they find their voices and make changes that affect the issues most important to them.",
