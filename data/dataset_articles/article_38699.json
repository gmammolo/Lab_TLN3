The seven-day holiday focuses on seven principles - unity, self-determination, responsibility, economics, purpose, creativity and faith. \"January 1st, that is the day of faith. Our focus is on what is our relationship with our creator God, and then how do we bring other people to that realization. Kwanzaa means first fruits. It's really a harvest festival,\" said Darnell Byrd McPherson, First Steps Darlington County. You're invited to a family-friendly Kwanzaa celebration this weekend in Darlington County. It's Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at First Steps in Lamar.",
