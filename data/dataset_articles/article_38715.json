  "text": "Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, An American College of Surgeons (ACS) verified Level 2 Trauma Center and a participant in the ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program, has been designated an ‘ACS Surgical Quality Partner.’ A Surgical Quality Partner designation signifies a hospital’s dedication to consistently improving procedures and approaches while maintaining a critical eye on the process at every step. “This recognition further reinforces our commitment to meeting the highest standards outlined by the American College of Surgeons,” said Gilda Cruz-Manglapus, Henry Mayo Trauma Program Manager. “As an ACS-verified trauma center and a participant in the ACS Trauma Quality Improvement Program, Henry Mayo is dedicated to providing the best possible care for trauma patients in our community.” The Surgical Quality Partner designation lets patients know Henry Mayo is dedicated to quality and relentless self-improvement and has been verified or accredited by the ACS. Patients can trust that the care they receive at Surgical Quality Partner hospitals adheres to the most rigorous standards in surgical quality. “ACS Quality programs are grounded in more than a century of experience and participation is an important measure of a hospital’s surgical quality. As an ACS Surgical Quality Partner, Henry Mayo has shown a commitment providing the best possible patient care, evaluating that care in a rigorous fashion, and dedicating themselves to continuous self-improvement,” said ACS Executive Director & Chief Executive Officer Patricia L. Turner, MD, MBA, and FACS. Sponsored Articles Do you have a news tip? Call us at (661) 298-1220, or send an email to news@hometownstation.com. Don’t miss a thing.
