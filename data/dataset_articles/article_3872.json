In a bold move splitting from his party on the matter, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) said despite previously voting to impeach Trump, he believed the former president should be able to run for office in 2024 because of the nation’s governing judicial principle: innocent until proven guilty. “I voted to impeach Donald Trump for his role in the January 6th insurrection,” Golden [wrote on X.](https://twitter.com/RepGolden/status/1740544590242074827) “I do not believe he should be reelected as president of the United States.” “However,” he continued, “we are a nation of laws, therefore until he is actually found guilty of the crime of insurrection, he should be allowed on the ballot.” The Democrat’s bold statement sets him apart from the rest of his party, highlighting their lack of interest in preserving free and fair elections. Rep. Golden’s comments counter the order from his state’s Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who on Thursday [declared](https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-maine-secretary-of-state-removes-trump-from-2024-ballot/) Trump would be stricken from the state’s primary ballot for allegedly inciting the J6 “insurrection.” Of course, Donald Trump has never been charged with, let alone convicted of, insurrection. The state of Colorado last week also moved to boot Trump from the state’s primary ballot, however, the state’s Republican party has [appealed the decision](https://www.infowars.com/posts/breaking-trump-back-on-colorado-primary-ballot/) to the US Supreme Court which will decide whether to hear the case or affirm the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision. Many suspect other Democrat-led states will follow the leads of Colorado and Maine, as the establishment launches an all-out effort to rig the 2024 election by denying voters the right to vote for their candidate of choice. The globalists are increasing their attacks on Infowars and the stakes have never been higher!
