  "text": "Queen Latifah, Dionne Warwick and the Bee Gees Barry Gibb have been awarded at the 2023 Kennedy Center Honors. Check out the footage below.\n- READ MORE:\nThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart review: a smart and poignant look at a cultural phenomenon\nThe annual honours are given to figures in the performing arts for their lifetime contribution to American culture, and were held earlier this month in Washington, D.C.\nWith\nPresident Biden in attendance, the show was hosted by Gloria Estefan, and featured tribute performances from artists including Gladys Knight, Missy Elliott and Michael BublÃ©. Rapsody played a version of Latifah s Just Another Day , while Monie Love and MC Lyte duetted on ‘Ladies First’. Elliott introduced her, saying: What Latifah has taught us is unity, to believe in yourself, and to love a Black woman from infinity to infinity.\nThree of Warwick s songs were performed at the ceremony, with\nChloe Bailey singing Walk On By , Cynthia Erivo taking Alfie and Knight doing a rendition of Say a Little Prayer .\nBublÃ© sang the Bee Gees song How Can You Mend a Broken Heart? for Gibb, while Little Big Town played Lonely Days, Lonely Nights and Ariana DeBose did a medley of hits, including Stayin Alive and How Deep is Your Love .\nFootage from the ceremony has now been shared by the Kennedy Center, where the actor and comedian Billy Crystal and the opera singer RenÃ©e Fleming were also honoured.\nAfter receiving news of her honour, Latifah said in a statement: When we started on this journey decades ago, we were often told No .\nTo now be recognised amongst so many multi-hyphenates feels unbelievable, not for just me and my team, but for our community.\nGibb also said that receiving the award is something that everyone hopes might happen one day . I ve often thought about it but never dreamed it could come true, he added.\nIn September,\nWarwick called out young man Elon Musk about the unpopular changes that he has made to Twitter/X since taking over the social media platform.\nRecently,\na woman claimed she had been scammed out of her retirement money by someone impersonating Barry Gibb.\nThe post\nWatch tributes to Queen Latifah, Dionne Warwick and Barry Gibb at 2023 Kennedy Center Honors appeared first on NME.",
