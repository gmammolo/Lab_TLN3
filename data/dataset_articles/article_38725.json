  "text": "Tomáš Souček and Dinos Mavropanos scored the goals as West Ham United produced a stunning team effort to close 2023 with a memorable 2-0 win at Arsenal. The Hammers pair struck either side of the break to give their team full value for a wonderfully resilient display – one which refused to let Mikel Arteta’s title-chasers through them. Souček finished a move which involved Lucas Paquetá, Emerson and Jarrod Bowen to give the Hammers a 13th minute lead, then one-time Arsenal defender Mavropanos rose highest to double the advantage ten minutes after the break. Saïd Benrahma could have made it three in stoppage time from the spot, but even David Raya’s save could not spoil a thrilling night in north London. There were lionhearted performances all over the pitch, from 35-year-old Angelo Ogbonna and his partners at the back, to the sheer doggedness of the midfield trio in refusing to bend, and the front three in providing an outlet. Victory gives West Ham 33 points at the half-way stage of the campaign – our highest figure at this stage of a Premier League season – and completes a December to remember, which included wins over Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and the Gunners. Our photographers were out and about capturing images from the day and you can view a full gallery by clicking on the photo above.",
