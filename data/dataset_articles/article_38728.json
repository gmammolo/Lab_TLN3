  "text": "MOORESVILLE, N.C. — \"Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen,\" Yes, that's right — one North Carolina woman is having the time of her life.\nIt started in 1992 when Cinamon Loyd was crowned Miss Statesville where she also found her future husband during the pageant. From there, she went on to compete in the Miss North Carolina pageant but she did not win.\n“The Miss America program, to be on that stage, was more like a fantasy,” Cinamon said.\nThirty years later, her daughter Taylor Loyd won the Miss Stateville crown. She also went on to win Miss North Carolina — making her mother proud. Despite the family history in pageants, Taylor Lord didn’t compete in her first pageant until she was 13.\n“When I decided I wanted to compete, I kind of had to convince them. They wanted to make sure I was serious about it,” Taylor Lyod said.\nNow, Taylor Loyd will head to Orlando, Florida next week to prepare for the Miss America pageant held Jan. 6th through the 14 at the Dr. Phillips Center for Performing Arts.\nOnly one Miss North Carolina has ever won Miss America and that was in 1962.\nTaylor Loyd is from Mooresville. She is a senior music and public policy major at UNC-Chapel Hill and plans to use the scholarship she won at Miss North Carolina to attend graduate school.\nStay connected to local, national, and breaking news: Download the WFMY News 2 app.\n► Text the word APP to 336-379-5775\n► DOWNLOAD FOR IPHONE HERE\n► DOWNLOAD FOR ANDROID HERE\nRELATED: NBA star takes 5 Greensboro teens on a Christmas trip to Miami\nRELATED: 3-time cancer survivor, Johnny Van Kemp collects toys for sick kids\nRELATED: Stories from the Triad that touched your heart in 2023\nMORE WAYS TO GET WFMY NEWS 2\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter Let’s Get 2 It!\nDownload the WFMY News 2 APP from your Apple or Google Play store.\nADD THE WFMY+ APP TO YOUR STREAMING DEVICE\nROKU: Add the channel from the ROKU store or search for WFMY.\nAmazon Fire TV: Search for WFMY to find the free app to add to your account.
