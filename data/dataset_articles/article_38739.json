  "text": "Jayden Reed (toe/chest) remains on track to play for Green Bay Green Bay Packers wide receiver Jayden Reed (toe/chest) was a limited practice participant again on Thursday for Week 17 versus the Minnesota Vikings. Reed has turned in back-to-back practices after being held out last week. Christian Watson (hamstring) and Dontayvion Wicks (chest/ankle) both sat out again Thursday, so Reed could see an uptick in targets on Sunday night. The Vikings are allowing the 10th-most FanDuel points per game to wide receivers this season and they have the No. 17 pass defense in the NFL, according to numberFire's opponent-adjusted efficiency metrics.
