  "text": "Talk about luck! Two people are recovering after rainy conditions in California led to an accident. According to [NBC Bay Area](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/2-people-rescued-san-francisco-glen-canyon-park/3407637/), the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) rescued the injured after their car flipped and slid down an embankment. The incident reportedly happened on Wednesday (Dec. 27), with a 911 call logged at 2:45 p.m. local time. A hiker near the accident area — Glen Canyon Park — told officials he had witnessed the navy blue sedan sliding down the hill. Firefighters later assessed that the car had skidded over 100 feet down the embankment. RELATED: [Hannah Payne Disobeyed 911 & That Led To Kenneth Herring’s Murder | TSR Investigates](https://theshaderoom.com/hannah-payne-kenneth-herring-life-sentence-death-threats-tsr-investigates/) To rescue [the driver](https://theshaderoom.com/crash-pennsylvania-school-bus-tow-truck-students-drivers-hospital/) and passenger, fire officials organized and executed a technical rescue. That process involved clearing thick brush leading to the damaged car and using ropes. Police reportedly shut down one lane of O’Shaughnessy Boulevard to carry out the rescue operation. How Did The Car Tumble Unto The Steep Embankment? Police are still investigating the car crash on the embankment. However, the local fire department told NBC Bay Area that things went left after the driver reportedly hit the curb. After the impact, the car rolled once and slid down the steep hill. Thankfully, the driver and passenger — whose connection remains unclear — sustained minor injuries. They were transported to a local hospital for additional evaluation following the incident. Fire officials have not released the identities of the injured. [PEOPLE](https://people.com/2-people-rescued-after-car-rolled-slid-over-100-feet-down-embankment-8420613) reports that rainy conditions in the area contributed to the embankment car accident. According to the National Weather Service, rain poured on the Bay Area between early Wednesday (before the crash) and finally tapered off early Thursday. Another storm is reportedly expected on Friday (Dec. 29). Meanwhile, the San Francisco PD is still investigating the case. Check out the thread below for SFFD’s photo and video of the rescue efforts. O’shaugnessy at Del Valle has one lane closed as [#YourSFFD]Heavy Rescue units work to rescue 2 persons from a vehicle 100ft down the slope. Avoid the area.
