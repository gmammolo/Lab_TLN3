  "text": " Maxwell helps Stars rain supreme against Hurricanes Read full article Martin Pegan 29 December 2023 at 12:20 am · 2-min read Jono Searle/AAP PHOTOS\nThe Melbourne Stars have continued their BBL resurgence, with captain Glenn Maxwell leading the side to a second consecutive victory in a rain-affected clash with the Hobart Hurricanes.\nThe Stars restricted the Hurricanes to 155 before wet and wild conditions blanketed Blundstone Arena during the innings break and reduced the target to 67 runs from seven overs under the DLS.\nMaxwell started the chase with Sam Harper but was stranded at the bowler's end as Hurricanes quick Riley Meredith (2-15) sparked the hosts with two wickets in the opening over on Thursday night.\nMeredith sent the first ball of the Stars' innings down the legside for a wide, but then had Harper out hooking off the next delivery.\nMarcus Stoinis was out three balls later in much the same way, and when Canes captain Nathan Ellis bowled Hilton Cartwright in the next over the Stars were reeling at 3-6.\nBut Maxwell (35 not out) and Thomas Rogers (21 not out) steered the Stars (2-3) home to make it back-to-back victories after a slow start to their Big Bash League campaign.\nMaxwell (3-29) had earlier taken three middle-order wickets to help restrict the Hurricanes to a modest total.\n\"I took a gamble to bring myself on,\" Maxwell told Fox Sports.\n\"With that little bit of drizzle and that rain it actually changed the pitch, I was able to get the ball to skid on a bit faster.\n\"You get a couple of lucky wickets with just timing.\"\nPakistan pacer Haris Rauf (3-24) chipped in with three scalps late in the innings as the Canes were bowled out with two balls remaining after a bright start.\nMac Wright (33) set the pace early for the Hurricanes until mistiming a waist-high full toss off Usama Mir to Stoinis diving low at deep midwicket.\nCaleb Jewell (45) maintained the momentum for the Hurricanes and smashed three consecutive boundaries off Beau Webster in the ninth over.\nThe Hurricanes opener sent a scare through the Stars' camp with a sharp straight drive off Maxwell that left the Australia international needing attention after getting a hand on the ball to prevent a certain boundary.\nStory continues The offspinner responded with the next delivery, darting a straight ball into Jewell's pads to trap him lbw for 45 off 37 balls and spark a middle-order collapse.\nNikhil Chaudhary looked set to rescue the hosts with positive play as he took 10 runs off two balls from Rauf.\nBut the Stars' quick responded by taking pace off the ball as Chaudhary swung hard again but was caught in the deep for 32 off 16 balls before the rain arrived.\nTRENDING 1.
