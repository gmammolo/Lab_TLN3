He works as a school bus driver and transports over 65 kids and teenagers to school every day.\nHe had heard stories about the miraculous rescue throughout his life, but was desperate to find his lifesaver and thank him – and he was eventually able to track Gilmore down on social media.\nDuring their touching meet-up – the trio playfully attempted to re-create the iconic photograph, with a now much larger Fox standing on a chair with his arms around Gilmore.\nFox joked that the picture captured his two favorite things – his harmonica, which he was clutching, and not wearing pants.\n‘Oh my god, you saved my kids,’ Mrs. Fox told Gilmore as she met him for the first time\nDuring their touching meet-up – the trio playfully attempted to re-create the iconic photograph, with a now much larger Fox standing on a chair with his arms around Gilmore\nFox opened up about his own lifesaving acts throughout his life – telling Gilmore that he saved a child from drowning when he was a teenager and managed to talk two people out of suicide while working as a recovery coach\n‘Forty-five years after this incident, who would think we will all still be here to be able to talk about it?’ Gilmore said.\nFox opened up about his own lifesaving acts throughout his life – telling Gilmore that he saved a child from drowning when he was a teenager and managed to talk two people out of suicide while working as a recovery coach.\n‘What you did, in turn, saved other people’s lives and brought more into the world,’ Fox said\n‘You didn’t just do your job,’ Silvia Fox told Gilmore as they prepared to leave, ‘You did it well.’\nThe Fox family also invited the photographer Rizer to join in on their reunion.\nRizer had captured the incredible picture after he had been photographing a fire in Chinatown earlier that day.\nHe shot many fires and disasters over his career as a photographer – and explained that anytime he managed to capture a dramatic rescue it was down to ‘pure serendipity’.\n‘The worst thing you can hear on the police scanner or fire scanner on the way to any event is, “children trapped,”‘ he said.\n‘If I spent four minutes at that fire, it’d be a miracle,’ Rizer said, adding that he shot less than one roll of 35mm film during the disaster.\n‘Joe did the heavy lifting — pun intended,’ Rizer said of Gilmore. ‘Media people, we just capture history, we don’t make it.’",
