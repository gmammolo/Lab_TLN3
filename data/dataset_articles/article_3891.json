  "text": "WATCH: Officers corral beaver found inside hospital lobby on Christmas Day BARTLETT, Tenn. ( [WMC](https://www.actionnews5.com/2023/12/28/police-release-body-cam-video-beaver-being-rescued-inside-hospital-christmas-day/)/Gray News) - The holiday season doesn’t stop hospitals from filling up with those who need medical help, but one hospital in Tennessee had an unexpected four-legged visitor on Christmas Day. St. Francis Hospital in Bartlett called their local police department early Monday morning to report a beaver that had snuck into the building. When officers reported to the scene, they said the beaver had dammed itself in the lobby. Aided by hospital staff, the officers-turned-rodent-wrangler corralled the animal into a rolling cart before taking it back to a nearby canal. Officials said they are uncertain just how the beaver got inside the hospital to begin with. Some speculate the critter was looking for Santa’s wooden toy department.
