  "text": "SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA & NORTHEAST TENNESSEE (WCYB) — Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is celebrating all 131 school divisions for finalizing their All in VA Plans. The All in VA Plan is focused on addressing learning loss, absenteeism and literacy. That will be done through high intensity tutoring, literacy education and measures to promote school attendance. Chronic absenteeism is having a trickledown effect in the classroom. \"Our students last year, who were chronically absent, and that means they missed more than 10-percent of their school year, actually scored 20 to 30 points less on their end of year assessments,\" said Lisa Coons, Virginia Superintendent of Public Instruction, earlier this school year. According to state education leaders, Virginia students continue to suffer from historic learning loss: But how are local school divisions shaping up? \"Our attendance rates are improving over last year. It looks like from our benchmark scores, that student achievement is going well,\" said Keith Perrigan, superintendent, Washington County Virginia, Public Schools. \"Washington County's SOL scores are the seventh highest in the state. Even though we are performing well, we do still have some gaps in instruction, and we are trying to focus on that with all the funding that we received in the most recent budget from Richmond and with our All in Tutoring Plan, and really focusing on those students who still have some gaps to overcome.\" While combatting these challenges continues to be a topic of discussion for administrators in Southwest Virginia, it's also something administrators in Northeast Tennessee are working to address. \"It's going to take years, I think, to catch people up,\" said John English, director, Unicoi County Public Schools. \"We are in this place where kids have slowly come back, some still haven't come back, we will get some kids periodically that we haven't seen since before COVID, and so there's still some large gaps.\" But what is the answer to helping students get back on track? \"The more consistently we can be in and dig and work -- we've got a lot of tutoring, we've been able to hire some high-quality tutor folks,\" said English. \"We are catching kids up and I feel like that's going well. They are working really hard, but there's certainly some gaps there that we will continue to address.\"",
