  "text": "She loves Broadway show tunes, Lady Gaga and Barbra Streisand. She can play the guitar like nobody’s business. But what defines Vicky Glikin at the moment is how her 44 years on Earth embrace two cultures and two countries now engulfed in war. Glikin is the senior cantor at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, where those who hear her sing constitute a loyal following. Music is her passion — her life — and in her view, it has never been more important than it is right now.\nAdvertisement She sees music as a force for good, a much-needed energy at a time when her native Ukraine, where she lived until 13, remains under siege from a Russian invasion that began in 2022.\nAdvertisement Cantor Vicky Glikin leaves her home in Dallas on Wednesday, April 13, 2022, for a one week trip to Warsaw, Poland, to represent Temple Emanu-El as she leads a Passover seder with Ukrainian women and children refugees.
