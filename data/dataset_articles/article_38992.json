  "text": "Nigerian singer, John Ighodaro, aka [Johnny Drille](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJwsG3-LKDAxVXV0EAHV7hB0QQFnoECD8QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJohnny_Drille&usg=AOvVaw135CKuPDvH4g7wGflDph1z&opi=89978449), has welcomed a daughter with his wife, Rima Tahini. LEADERSHIP recalls that Johnny Drille’s wedding pictures went viral in July 2023. However, his wife who is the director of Artiste and Repertoire (A&R) at Mavin Records, posted about their first anniversary on January 5, 2023. The birth of their daughter was announced on Thursday via Johnny Drille’s official X account. He wrote “Six weeks ago today, we held in our arms our daughter for the first time. It’s hard to explain but it’s the most miraculous thing I’ve ever known. “I pray to God to help me be the best father for our daughter.” The singer who shared a video documenting moments before and after his daughter’s birth disclosed the child’s name: Amaris which means ‘God’s promise fulfilled’. According to his post, the child was born on November 17, 2023.",
