  "text": "Hastings man vying for U.S. Congress seat HASTINGS, Neb. – Hastings resident John Walz has announced his intentions to run against incumbent Congressman Adrian Smith of Nebraska's 3rd Congressional District. Walz is the owner of the Food Cupboard discount grocery stores, located in Hastings and Grand Island. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1998 with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. A press release from Walz says he's a devoted Christian. His life embodies his unwavering commitment to God, family, and country. Walz is a United States Marine Corps veteran, seasoned engineer, and successful entrepreneur, he stands alongside his wife of over three decades, raising a loving family of ten children. For John Walz, God, family, and country isn't a mere saying—it's his guiding principle. His deep-rooted understanding of American history reveals the providential moments that shaped the birth of the world's freest nation. John is well versed in both historical narratives and present-day challenges facing the nation. He asserts a firm grasp on the overt intentions of America's adversaries—be it the communists, radical Islam, or global elites—who openly plot the downfall of the nation. Walz's release states, “I am seeking many volunteers and contributions ASAP because the runway is short,” referring to his late entry into the race. He can be emailed at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or contacted through his campaign website. Walz adamantly states that for the sake of our kids, and all future generations, we must Save the Republic, we must vote MAGA, we must vote Walz for US Congress.
