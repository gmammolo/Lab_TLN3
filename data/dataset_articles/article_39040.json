She would play Katie and win an Oscar.\nKatie Price is in talks with a very famous BBC actress who says her “ultimate ambition” is to make a film about her life.\nKatie is now interested in a movie or TV show by none other than BAFTA-winning This Country star Daisy May Cooper (pictured February 2023).\n“If I could do things like hers on a production budget, then that would be the dream.”\nSpeaking to Katie on her podcast, she told him: ‘You and I need a day. Just tell me all the pieces of your life and then we’ll try to find a story arc for where we would go, whether it’s a movie or a series.\n‘I think that would be great! Doing it all from your perspective, the shit we didn’t see and the documentary didn’t see. How it really is.\nThe unlikely duo seemed to get along well and have clearly remained on each other’s minds.\nAppearing on Jamie Laing’s Private Parts podcast, Katie said: ‘Daisy loves me. In the podcast she says, “I have to write your Netflix movie.”\n“She’s so adamant, she really wants to do it.”\nSince This Country, Daisy has taken part in Masked Singer and is now team captain on Sky’s pop quiz Never Mind The Buzzcocks.\nAlso on Katie’s podcast, Daisy shared that she had stopped drinking seven months prior.\nKatie has been through experiences that would be dramatic on the big screen, including 16 boob jobs, three marriages and several court appearances.\nKatie and Daisy discussed the idea on The Katie Price Show last month.\nDaisy, who has had a dramatic weight loss journey since giving up alcohol, revealed that drinking made her feel “destructive to everyone” on The Katie Price Show podcast.\nDaisy went on to say about not having a hangover: “It’s absolutely wonderful to wake up without hangover anxiety and think ‘who the fuck did I text last night?’\n‘Because I’ll start calling an ex-boyfriend… It got to a point where I couldn’t even trust myself to go out for a drink, so I was just drinking at home.\n“I thought, ‘If they give me a handjob showing my pussy somewhere.'”\nDaisy has been photographed looking incredible at multiple events throughout the year and has been open about her weight loss.\nThe actress, who was photographed flaunting her trim figure at a Legoland launch event in October, followed the ketogenic (low-carb, high-fat) diet to lose weight after lockdown.\nHowever, she confessed that she has since received a flood of messages telling her that she is “no longer funny” since she changed her appearance.\nSpeaking about her appearance, the mother-of-two said: “I’m very much into body positivity, but when I was older I was more miserable and had a huge food addiction.”\nDaisy, who split from husband Will Weston in July 2021 after almost two years of marriage, continued: “I wasn’t healthy.” She couldn’t breathe when she went up the stairs. She was so unhappy.\nAnd I’ve gotten some messages like, ‘Well, now that you’ve lost weight you’re not funny anymore.’\nDaisy, who has had a dramatic weight loss journey since giving up alcohol, was pictured looking incredible at a Legoland launch event in October.\nDaisy has been photographed looking incredible at multiple events throughout the year and has been open about her weight loss (pictured right and left in May 2019).",
