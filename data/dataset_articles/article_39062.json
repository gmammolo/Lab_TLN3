  "text": "ZUG, Switzerland — Abby Stonehouse scored two short-handed goals and added three assists to lead Canada past Czechia 8-1 on Sunday at the world under-18 women's hockey championship. Stonehouse score twice in the second period for Canada (2-0), which opened the tournament Saturday with an 11-0 victory over Germany. Morgan Jackson and Caitlin Kraemer (two apiece), Emma Venusio and Mackenzie Alexander had the other goals. Aneta Paroubkova replied for Czechia (0-2). Kraemer had two goals Saturday to become Canada's national women's under-18 all-time leading goal scorer with 17. Kraemer opened the scoring with a short-handed goal at 12:28 of the first. But Canada broke the game open in the second, outscoring Czechia 4-1 in the period. Stonehouse put Canada ahead 2-0 at 1:43 before scoring her second of the period at 8:20.
