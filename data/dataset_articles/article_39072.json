  "text": "RIANNE Malixi considers her performance last year as “solid” but is determined to elevate her game further, aiming for greater golfing achievements abroad this year.\nWhile contemplating a collegiate future with Duke University, Malixi isn’t dismissing the possibility of venturing into the professional ranks sooner than planned.\nRecapping her 2023 season, the ICTSI-backed shotmaker describes it as a year of “almosts,” acknowledging fewer victories compared to the previous year but highlighting consistent Top 10 finishes in 14 global ranking tournaments.\n“I’d say I had a pretty solid campaign in 2023. I’d summarize it as a year of ‘almosts,’” said Malixi. “Even if I didn’t win as many events compared to 2022, I performed well, finishing in the Top 10 in most events I played in.”\nThough still without a major victory, Malixi has won two AJGA (American Junior Golf Association) tournaments, placed fourth in last year’s Junior World in San Diego and has racked up four victories on the Ladies Philippine Golf Tour.\nShe also shared being tantalizingly close to clinching certain events, notably her runner-up effort in the US Girls’ Junior Championship.\n“There were events that I was so close to winning” added the 16-year-old rising star, referring to her second-place finish in the US Girls’ in Colorado.\nConcluding the season at No. 62 in the world’s women’s amateur ranking, Malixi recognizes the roller coaster nature of her international performances but emphasizes delivering her best showing in the US.\n“I believe my best plays were in the US, specifically in the US Girls,” said Malixi. “My campaign outside the Philippines was very much of a roller coaster. I had a couple of not-so-well performances but also played extremely well in the other events. With so many events I played in, I realized I am a pretty clutch player.”\nLooking ahead to the new season, Malixi looks for improvement in both the physical and mental aspects of her game, drawing on lessons learned from the previous year’s challenges and successes.",
