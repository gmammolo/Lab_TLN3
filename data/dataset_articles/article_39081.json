  "text": "A particularly moving moment came at the end of Maccabi Haifa's 1-2 victory over Hapoel Jerusalem tonight (Sunday). 12-year-old Erez Calderon, who returned from Hamas captivity, took to the grass at Sami Ofer together with Maccabi Haifa midfielder Goni Naor and assistant coach Shahar Weisinger, played with them and even scored several goals.\nAll around, Erez's family cheered, including his 16-year-old sister Sahar, who was also abducted and released along with her brother in the abduction deal. The father of the family, Ofer, has been held captive by Hamas since that Saturday of 7 October, when he was abducted together with his family.\nEven before the opening whistle, Erez Calderon went up along with Maccabi Haifa and Hapoel Jerusalem players. Along with him came children and families of murdered victims or others who came from Kibbutz Nir Oz. The event is moving and the special one left many tearful eyes in the stands.\nThe hottest sports articles and updates on your Telegram\nJoin\nThe father who remained in Gaza, Ofer Calderon, photo: Private\nWrong?
