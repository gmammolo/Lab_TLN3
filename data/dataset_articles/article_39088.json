  "text": "The Buffalo Bills are playoff bound! The Bills clinched a spot in the 2023-24 NFL Playoffs following the Jaguars loss to the Titans on Sunday. This marks Buffalo's fifth straight playoff appearance and is their second longest streak in team history. The Bills have secured at least a Wild Card spot and could clinch the AFC East division with a win over the Dolphins on Sunday Night Football. If Buffalo beats Miami, the Bills will earn the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs and host the No. 7 seed Pittsburgh Steelers. A loss to the Dolphins means the Bills will be theÂ No. 7 seed and go right back to Miami next weekend. Buffalo has also won at least 10 games for the fifth consecutive season and set a new franchise record for most double digit win seasons in a row. The team is now riding a four-game win streak after defeating New England; it's their longest win streak since the Bills won seven straight to finish the 2022 season. Buffalo is also 18-2 in December and January games since 2020 (best record in the NFL). The Bills-Dolphins AFC East championship matchup kicks off from Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday at 8:20 p.m. Check out the best travel photos as the Bills fly to Miami to face the Dolphins.
