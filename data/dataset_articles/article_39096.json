  "text": "Islamabad: Islahee Jamaat & Aalmi Tanzeem ul Arifeen of shrine Hazrat Sultan Bahoo (RA) organised the Annual Milad-e-Mustafa and Haq Bahoo Conference at Jinnah Convention Centre, here. Patron-in-chief of Jamaat and Tanzeem Hazrat Sultan Muhammad Ali presided over the conference. Ambassadors of the republics of Palestine, Azerbaijan, Sudan, and Indonesia participated in the conference. Secretary General of Jamaat and Tanzeem Sahibzada Sultan Ahmad Ali while addressing the gathering said that the vitality of the message of Sufis has increased manifold nowadays. He said Sufis unfolded the teachings of Islam in letter and spirit. The essence of religion lies in the love of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him). Islam not only guides our material life but also grants a complete code of spiritual life. The Holy Quran draws social principles to bring social order to a society. Elimination of social unrest and the creation of a balanced society is what the Quran instructs. The fundamental message of Deen is to follow the commandments of Allah through the injunctions of the Holy Quran and obedience of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him). The love for the Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him)is the fundamental prerequisite of religion. He said one could never attain the actual essence of Deen unless he loves the Holy Prophet (PBUH) more than anything. It is manifested in the Holy Quran as human beings need to strengthen their relationship with Allah, they need to strengthen their relationship with Holy Prophet (PBUH) in the same proportion. The Holy Quran teaches manners of the court of Holy Prophet (PBUH). He pointed out that the will of God is the will of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him). Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him)said if one wants to complete one’s faith one has to surrender himself in front of the teachings of Quran and Sunnah. He questioned do actions on these channels depict our love and followership with Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him). The answer is very disappointing. Our social media is flooded by hate every day. Holy Prophet Hazrat Mohammad (peace be upon him) never hated, abused, or blamed anybody in his entire life. The recent Gaza and Ukraine war has exposed the hypocrisy of the world. Moreover, the silence of Ummah on the issue of Gaza has badly exposed our spiritual decline. On the occasion, Haji Muhammad Nawaz Qadri, Nazim-e-Ala of the Jamaat emphasised that the teachings of Sufis prioritise the purification of self and the adoption of Islamic values in letter and spirit. It has been the method of Sufis to learn the Holy Quran and apply its commandments in our daily lives.
