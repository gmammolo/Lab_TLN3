  "text": "HONOLULU (KHNL/Gray News) - Firefighters in Hawaii helped rescue a 71-year-old woman and her dog after their car went off a cliff in Maui Friday.\nThe Maui Department of Fire and Public Safety said emergency responders found the vehicle off the side of Kahekili Highway.\nThe rescuers used ropes to perform the rescue. They estimated the drop-off they were hanging over went 200 feet deep.\nThe rescue began just before noon, according to officials. Fire personnel used ropes to get to the victim and remove her from the car.\nThe highway was closed to allow first responders to work safely and has since reopened.\nOfficials said both the woman and the dog were rescued with no injuries.\nCopyright 2024 KHNL/KGMB via Gray Media Group, Inc.
