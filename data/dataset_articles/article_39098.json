  "text": "The Detroit Lions successfully defended the den in the regular season finale against the Minnesota Vikings. The Lions held off the Vikings, 30-20, in the Week 18 matchup in Ford Field.\nJared Goff threw for 320 yards and two touchdowns in a mistake-free offensive performance. David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs each rushed for a touchdown as well in an uneven game that saw Detroit convert just one of its nine third-down attempts.\nBig plays and special teams ruled the day for Detroit, which improved to 12-5 with the win. Amon-Ra St. Brown caught a 70-yard touchdown pass, and Kalif Raymond ignited a drive with a 42-yard punt return and also chipped in with a 41-yard catch-and-run. Punter Jack Fox had a fantastic game and his coverage units were sharp, too.\nThe defense also made some big plays. Detroit sacked Nick Mullens four times and forced him into two fourth-quarter interceptions under heavy pressure. Aidan Hutchinson bagged two sacks and had another 12-yard tackle-for-loss, while rookie LB Jack Campbell notched a sack amongst his team-high 11 tackles.\nThe victory could be a costly one for Detroit. Pro Bowl tight end Sam LaPorta and Raymond both left the game with knee injuries that could impact their availability in the wild card round next weekend.\nDetroit’s 12th win ties a team record set back in 1991, the last year the Lions won a postseason game. The Vikings finish 7-10 a year after winning the NFC North.\nRelated Lions rookies set NFL offensive production record",
