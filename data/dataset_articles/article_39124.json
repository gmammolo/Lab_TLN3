  "text": "Halle Bailey welcomes baby boy with boyfriend DDG Singer and star of \"The Little Mermaid\" [Halle Bailey](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/entertainment/halle-bailey-melissa-mccarthy-inspiration/index.html) is welcoming a new baby boy to be part of her world. \"Even though we're a few days into the new year, the greatest thing that 2023 could have done for me, was bring me my son,\" Bailey [wrote](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1yL3AfLrJj/?hl=en) on her Instagram page alongside a photo showcasing her newborn son's hand wearing a gold bracelet with his name, \"Halo,\" engraved on it. \"Welcome to the world my halo,\" she wrote. \"The world is desperate to know you.\" Bailey's boyfriend, rapper DDG, [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1yN27gLJtY/?hl=en) the same photo on his Instagram on Saturday, writing, \"my biggest blessing by far\" and that he's \"never been so in love.\" The couple, who have been [romantically linked](https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/halle-bailey-and-ddgs-relationship-timeline-photos/) since 2022, had not confirmed they were expecting, making Saturday's announcement a surprise. While they stayed mum on their expanding family, Bailey previously opened up about her blossoming relationship with DDG, telling British Vogue in a 2022 [interview](https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/halle-bailey-british-vogue-interview) that \"experiencing deep love for the first time in my life is something I feel has opened a whole new world for me creatively.\" \"I like all of the scary feelings that come with that. I like the suspense, the not knowing what's going to happen, and I feel like that's what I'm supposed to be going through in womanhood,\" she added. This is Bailey and DDG's first child together.",
