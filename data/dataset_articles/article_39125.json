  "text": "As Manfred Hin tinkers in his backyard workshop in the sweltering north Queensland heat, his heart and mind are thousands of kilometres away.\nThe 66-year-old Townsville builder spent most of 2023 volunteering in Ukraine, restoring homes and schools ravaged by Russian attacks.\nThe experience has changed the course of his life.\nManfred Hin has been involved in rebuilding more than 50 homes in Ukraine. ( Supplied )\n\"I'm conscious … I could be killed. I've lost three people working with me,\" he said.\n\"But how do you concern yourself with what might happen in the face of what has happened to other people?\n\"Every time it gets a bit too noisy from the rockets and from the artillery, I tell them to turn up AC/DC so we don't hear it anymore, and we keep going.\"\nMany buildings in Ukraine have been reduced to rubble. ( Supplied: Hamish Stirling )\nMr Hin has been involved in rebuilding more than 50 houses and a dozen schools damaged during the ongoing war with Russia.\nWorking with Ukrainian charity Brave to Rebuild, he has become a mentor to young volunteers.\nHe has also personally sourced three tonnes of donated tools.\n\"It's a never-ending story, but you can't sit back and do nothing,\" Mr Hin said.\nGrowing up in post-war Germany before emigrating to Australia in 1983, the veteran builder has been horrified by the scale of human suffering in Ukraine.\nManfred Hin intends to return to Ukraine in the coming months. ( ABC News: Baz Ruddick )\n\"When you're over there, it is almost like mirror image to World War II,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't help when I was a little boy but now I can.\n\"It's a call of the heart, I would say.\"\nInspiring others Mr Hin's efforts have not gone unnoticed.\nTasmanian carpenter Hamish Stirling read an ABC News article about the builder's work in Ukraine.\nThe story struck a chord.\nHamish Stirling travelled from Tasmania to join the rebuilding effort. ( ABC News: Maren Preuss )\n\"I thought it was a really effective way for me to contribute to the effort,\" Mr Stirling said.\nThe 36-year-old spent a few months learning Ukrainian before packing his bags and boarding a flight to Europe.\n\"At the time I was working for myself … so I put work on hold for three months and took over what tools I could fit in my luggage allowance,\" he said.\nMr Stirling split his time between two volunteer organisations, where he demolished damaged homes and rebuilt others from the ground up.\nVolunteers from Brave to Rebuild clear rubble in Ukraine. ( Supplied: Hamish Stirling )\n\"[On] some streets, you'll have every third or fourth house completely destroyed,\" he said.\n\"[There's] a lot of potholes in the ground from mortars landing, and bullet holes on the fences and … burnt out cars; that's a really common sight.\"\nThe carpenter said that he was brought to tears to witness the grit and spirit of Ukrainians who had lost so much in the war.\nHamish Stirling took his own tools to Ukraine. ( ABC News: Maren Preuss )\n\"Even just clearing rubble and demolishing a partially destroyed house means that they can rebuild and get on with their lives again,\" he said.\n\"That means everything when you've got nothing.\"\nMr Stirling said he was rewarded with warm hospitality and \"lots of hugs\".\n\"That, and the homemade vodka,\" he laughed.\n\"There was a bit of that floating around during work.\"\nHamish Stirling spent three months volunteering in Ukraine. ( Supplied: Hamish Stirling )\nBuilders without borders Manfred Hin returned to Townsville last month to see his family, but has no intention of remaining in Australia for long.\nAfter spending a few months raising crucial funds, he will return to Ukraine where he has \"hundreds of houses\" lined up for repairs as the war stretches on.\nManfred Hin's time in Ukraine is far from over. ( ABC News: Lily Nothling )\n\"The average cost of rebuilding a house in Ukraine is $2,500, which is not a lot,\" Mr Hin said.\n\"We're not talking about a fully furnished house, it's not a mansion.\n\"But it is [getting] the walls restored, the roof put on, the windows and the doors, some heating and sanitation … and water flowing.\"\nThe builder has already connected with dozens of tradespeople from across the world to continue the reconstruction work.\nVolunteers have been responsible for vital building repairs. ( Supplied: Hamish Stirling )\nHis long-term goal is to create a permanent network of \"builders without borders\".\n\"There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands [of people] waiting for a little bit of help,\" Mr Hin said.\n\"Giving them hope, I think, is probably more important than giving them a roof.\"\nPosted 2h ago 2 hours ago Sun 7 Jan 2024 at 8:39pm Share\nCopy link\nFacebook\nX (formerly Twitter)\nRelated Stories Why this Queensland builder has booked a one-way flight to Ukraine When the war started, Rusty moved to Ukraine.
