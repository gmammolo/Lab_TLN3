  "text": "LSU women's basketball weathers storm in win at Ole Miss [Cory Diaz](https://www.theadvertiser.com/staff/4406889002/cory-diaz/) Kim Mulkey has sounded almost like a broken record when discussing this season's [LSU women's basketball team's](https://www.theadvertiser.com/sports/lsu/) ability to score the basketball. By halftime Sunday afternoon, LSU has already put up 50 points and questions on if Ole Miss could slow it down seemed to be silenced. Then the Rebels went to the three-quarter court press and stifled the Tigers' attack. But the No. 7-ranked [Tigers weathered the storm in their Southeastern Conference road test](/story/sports/college/lsu/2024/01/07/lsu-womens-basketball-ole-miss-score-live-updates/72119872007/), outlasting Ole Miss, 84-73, inside the Pavilion. Star Angel Reese helped her team survive, putting up 10 of her game-high 21 points in the second half. LSU women's basketball loses control of game in second half vs. Ole Miss' pressure defense Coming in, Ole Miss coach Yolette McPhee-McCuin's team ranked 13th in the country in scoring defense, giving up 52.4 points per game. LSU got off to a hot start as Angel Reese, Flau'jae Johnson and Mikaylah Williams each scored double-digits in the first half. LSU led by 13 at halftime, but the Rebs implemented its press, trap defense coming out of the locker room and it worked. the Tigers couldn't regain their footing on offense, managing just 17 points and giving the ball away six times in the third quarter as Ole Miss stormed back into the game at 67-62. Point guard Hailey Van Lith struggled to handle the press and picked up four fouls by late in the third quarter. But the Tigers rebounded, outscoring the Rebels 17-11 to pull away. Kim Mulkey's star freshman Mikaylah Williams continues to shine How would WIlliams handle her first SEC road game? The freshman emphatically and quickly answered that question. As has been the case her freshman campaign thus far, Williams was not rattled by the record-sized crowd at Ole Miss as she led poured in 18 points, including nailing four 3's. She snapped LSU's scoring drought in the third when the team needed it.
