  "text": "TRUMBULL, Conn. (WFSB/Gray News) - A firefighter who was plowing the snowy streets of Trumbull, Connecticut, jumped into action to rescue four people and three dogs when he happened upon a house fire.\nWFSB reports Shaun Bogen’s quick actions were credited with saving the lives of the victims.\nThe Long Hill Fire Department said the house fire on Haviland Drive began just before 4 a.m. Sunday.\nWhile he was on the plowing route, Bogen discovered a house with a fire in the garage, according to the fire department. Bogen radioed into his base to alert them of the fire and called 911.\nBogen then sprung into action, waking up the four sleeping residents and their three dogs and making sure everyone was outside before the fire department arrived.\nA total of 26 firefighters responded to the fire, and the first unit to arrive found the fire most heavy in the garage and extending into the home.\nThe firefighters brought the fire under control in less than one hour.\nOfficials said there did not appear to be any injuries.\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\nCopyright 2024 WFSB via Gray Media Group, Inc.
