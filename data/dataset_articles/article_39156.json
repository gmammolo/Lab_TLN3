  "text": "Gifts have kept pouring in for Deborah Loveth (Mum Zee), the lady who became a sensation on X for waking up very early to cook for her husband. Mum Zee [went viral](https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/x-users-gift-over-n2m-to-lady-criticised-for-cooking-for-husband-at-450-am/) after she disclosed the reason she gets up from bed at 4:50 am to prepare her husband’s lunch. The lady said she made it a daily routine after her husband told her his colleague (a female) brought two spoons with her food to work so they could eat together. The tweet sparked arguments on social media. While some users criticised her over the routine others tackled her husband for eating out in the first instance. Amid the criticism, some users on X rallied support and donations for Mum Zee. Mum Zee later [revealed](https://lifestyle.thecable.ng/x-users-gift-over-n2m-to-lady-criticised-for-cooking-for-husband-at-450-am/) that the donations had passed over N2 million. Loveth has also received several gifts courtesy of celebrities, brands, and X users. Some of the gifts include a movie date at Filmhouse cinemas, a year’s supply of insecticide, free antenatal and delivery care, scholarships to study abroad, health insurance, and legal representation for one year. The expecting mother also received maternity gowns, toiletries, provisions, data and Netflix subscriptions, electricity bills, cryptocurrency, airtime, a year’s supply of diapers, and family care insurance in Oyo state. Other gifts range from phones, bed frames, home appliances, laptops, food items, window blinds, TV stands, mattresses, rugs, artworks, jerseys and clothing items for herself and her husband.
