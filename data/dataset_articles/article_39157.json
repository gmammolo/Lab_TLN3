  "text": "Katsina government says it’s recording success against banditry The Katsina state government says it is recording considerable success in its fight against criminal activities, in the face of recent attacks on traders in Danmusa LGA. Nasiru Muazu-Danmusa, commissioner for internal security and home affairs, disclosed this during an interview with NAN. He said the Dikko Radda administration has been battling cattle rustling, banditry, kidnapping and other crimes since it took over the reins last May. “The problem has now reduced to about 60 percent from the reliable information we have been receiving across the state,” Muazu-Danmusa said. “That is why the terrorists resorted to using other ways in perpetrating their heinous acts. “We condemned what happened in Danmusa LGA where the bandits attacked traders on their way to Yantumaki market from Maidabino. “They laid ambush against the traders, killing at least six persons and injuring others, including two of the security personnel escorting the traders. “It was reliably gathered that no fewer than 16 of the terrorists were killed at the scene by security operatives during the encounter and many escaped with gunshot wounds.” He warned people in the communities against protecting criminals and added that those who do so will be dealt with. “It is unfortunate and unpatriotic that some people supply information about their communities to the terrorists,” he added. “Some evil people who don’t wish the society well also supply food and drugs to terrorists. There were others who offer medical treatment to them when they sustained gunshot wounds.”",
