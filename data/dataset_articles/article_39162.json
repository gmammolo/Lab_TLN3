O'Connell, C.M., was moved from intensive care to the Cardiac Care Unit of Santo Spirito Hospital in Rome Jan. 7, where he continues his recovery from surgery after suffering a heart attack days earlier. Bishop O’Connell has been hospitalized since Jan. 4 after undergoing emergency cardiac surgery to open a blocked artery. The Bishop had been in Rome a few days ahead of the arrival of some 20 priests of the Diocese for a planned pilgrimage. In a brief communication with The Monitor Jan. 7, Bishop O’Connell expressed gratitude for all the prayers and good wishes he is receiving and says he is feeling better each day. He looks forward to returning home as soon as possible. The Bishop added that although he misses being with the priests on pilgrimage, he is very happy that they are enjoying their visit to Rome.
