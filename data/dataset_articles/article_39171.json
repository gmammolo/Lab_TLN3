  "text": "Matthew Slater hasn’t confirmed Sunday’s game against the New York Jets will be the final one in his NFL career, but it seems more likely after seeing his emotional moment with family, teammates, coaches and even owner Robert Kraft on the sidelines before the game.\nThe New England Patriots longtime captain is arguably the greatest special teamer in NFL history with 10 Pro Bowls and eight All Pro awards throughout the course of his illustrious career.\nBefore the game, Patriots players could be seen wearing “Captain 18” hoodies out of respect for Slater, who has been with the Patriots since he was drafted out of UCLA in 2008.\nAll the Patriots out in “Captain 18” hoodies. Feels like a celebration of Matthew Slater’s career🎉🎉 pic.twitter.com/jktWNVE1aG\n— The Camera Guys (@NBCSCameraGuys) January 7, 2024\nMatthew Slater greeting his parents and brother before the game pic.twitter.com/dCXVodXrY2\n— Omar Ruiz (@OmarDRuiz) January 7, 2024\nIf this really is the end, Slater’s elite on-field talent, along with his inspiring voice in the locker room, will be greatly missed for the Patriots. Even more than his talent, he’s a once-in-a-lifetime human being.\nMore Patriots News Instant analysis: Patriots' 15-game streak gets iced in 17-3 snowstorm loss to Jets Patriots Week 18 inactives: Mac Jones OUT, Nathan Rourke IN vs Jets Another team reportedly emerges as possible landing spot for Bill Belichick",
