  "text": "One of the Pocatello area's most popular dessert businesses will be closed temporarily but will return following a destructive fire last week. The blaze on Marble Drive north of Chubbuck severely damaged Janna Herron's home as well as her business, Woodland Orchards, known throughout Idaho for its delicious caramel apples. Janna, her husband Cliff and four children have found a duplex to rent while their home is repaired, which could take a year or more. The fire started when wood stove ash reignited in a trash can outside the Herrons' home and quickly spread to the residence and attached Woodland Orchards shop. Herron said the ash had been in a metal container for four days so they thought it was safe to throw out. The fire gutted the Woodland Orchards shop, destroying all of the business' equipment and $3,000 worth of chocolate Herron had just purchased. The flames also spread to the home's garage area and attic. The Herrons have insurance but they don't yet know how much of their losses will be covered. Herron said that even though she doesn't know when her business will be back up and running, she wants to continue paying her hard-working employees. A GoFundMe online fundraiser has been started to help Herron's family and business recover from the devastating fire. Donations can be made at [https://gofund.me/a3d93fc3](https://gofund.me/a3d93fc3). Herron said the blaze has been especially hard on her children. Her youngest kids, ages 10 and 6, lost all their toys due to smoke contamination while her two oldest kids, ages 14 and 17, already had to deal with the loss of much of their school in last year's Highland High School fire and now are trying to cope with the fire that destroyed much of their home. Herron said she's thankful a contractor working nearby spotted the flames on Wednesday morning and alerted her that her house was on fire. She was the only one at home at the time. Herron stated via Facebook, \"I heard someone pounding on our door, and then my power went out. I opened the door wondering what on earth was going on when a contractor in the area had seen the fire and called 911. He said, 'Your house is on fire!' I heard him but didn't quite know what to do. You know when you talk to your kids and tell them if there is ever a fire meet at such and such place... well that went out the window for me and my mind went blank. I ran back inside. Smart, I know, and grabbed my kids' scrapbooks.... I looked at my book shelf and saw all of my parents' scrapbooks and their journals and all the physical things that I had left of them and wanted to grab it all but couldn't. I couldn't go back inside. They wouldn't let me. The fire was in the ceiling by that point.\" It took North Bannock, Fort Hall and Chubbuck firefighters over an hour to get the fire under control. Marble Drive off 2 1/2 Mile Road was shut down for several hours because of the blaze. \"There are definitely no words to describe the minutes waiting for a fire truck to show up while watching your childhood home and current family's home burn,\" Herron stated via Facebook. \"We had so many neighbors that I knew, and some I didn't know reach out to help in any way. Trust me, it's not a good way to meet your neighbors. I have waves of emotions from laughter to crying and all the feelings in between. Can I just tell you, though, that there was a definite moment, while I watched things that I loved and put blood, sweat and tears into burn down. I felt a distinct peace and the words good things can come from bad things that happen, came to mind. I knew it! I have experienced it before and can not help but feel this. It will be a long road and a lot of emotions and feelings will be felt but we will be good...eventually.\" Herron said members of her family's Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ward have also provided help in the fire's aftermath and she's thankful that the blaze did not result in any injuries. \"When they finally let us back into the house, I had in my mind the worst-case scenario,\" Herron wrote. \"We were pleasantly surprised that things were salvageable. I am sure that there is water damage in areas that we can't see, but when I saw the bookshelves with my parents' stuff, it was untouched. As far as my business goes... I don't know. We will figure that out tomorrow and in the days to come. For now, we are closed temporarily, but we will be back. I love what we do and the people I get to meet way too much.\"",
