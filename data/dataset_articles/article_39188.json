Nick Offerman is sharing his gratitude with the world after winning his very first Emmy during Saturday’s Creative Arts Emmys ceremony. The actor took home the trophy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his role in HBO’s The Last of Us, and since emotions were “running high” during his speech, he posted it in full on social media Sunday.\n“Well, friends, I won an Emmy art trophy last night for my guest star role [in] HBO’s gorgeous rendition of a Craig Mazin script,” the actor captioned on\nAfter thanking the Academy for the “pat on the back,” the actor quickly acknowledged his scene partner, Murray Bartlett, jokingly referring to him as “the Girth from Perth.” He went on to thank the creative forces at HBO and The Last of Us creator Neil Druckman, among others, before setting his sights on series creator Craig Mazin.\n“We would all just be standing around with our thumbs up our asses if Craig Mazin had not written this script,” he said during his acceptance. “This was the best script I’ve ever been handed. If you enjoy what we do, then it’s always and only because the writing is so good, and I’m so grateful to be able to participate in this tradition of ‘storytelling as medicine,’ with which we demonstrate our devotion to each other, because as Wendell Berry says, it all turns on affection.”\nOfferman also made sure to drop in a reference to his character’s love for strawberries. Read the actor’s full acceptance speech below.\nNight 1 of the Creative Arts\nEmmys were held Saturday, with The Last of Us dominating with eight wins total. It took home trophies for Guest Actor and Actress (Storm Reid), main title design, prosthetic makeup, single-camera picture editing, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects.
