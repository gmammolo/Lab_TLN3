  "text": "- Lauren Boebert and her ex-husband, Jayson Boebert, were reportely involved in a physical confrontation on Saturday.\n- The alleged incident, which occurred at a Colorado restaurant, was first reported by The Daily Beast.\n- Jayson Boebert attempted \"to grab her\" in \"an aggressive move, not romantic,\" per an aide who heard from Lauren Boebert.\nA physical confrontation between US Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and her ex-husband Jayson Boebert ended with Mr. Boebert calling the police, according to reports.\nA meeting between the\nlong-embattled couple became physical on Saturday night, The Daily Beast first reported, citing an aide to Lauren Boebert. Colorado's Silt Police Department confirmed to the outlet that an \"active investigation\" is ongoing.\nThe police department did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Sunday. A spokesperson from Lauren Boebert's office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLauren Boebert's aide told The Daily Beast that the former couple met up at a restaurant after Jayson Boebert asked for a meeting with his ex-wife after attempting to hug her earlier that same day when she picked up their son from his home. At one point at the restaurant, Jayson Boebert attempted \"to grab her\" in \"an aggressive move, not romantic,\" The Daily Beast reported, citing the aide, who had heard the story from Lauren Boebert.\nAs Lauren Boebert attempted to keep Jayson Boebert back, she \"put her hand in his face, put her hand on his nose,\" and then Jayson Boebert called the police to report a case of domestic violence, The Daily Beast reported, citing the aide.\nLauren Boebert then called a non-emergency number and said that a domestic violence incident had not occurred, per the report.\nJayson Boebert spoke with The Daily Beast on Sunday and\nconfirmed the details of an X post from the American Muckrakers PAC that his ex-wife had \"punched\" him in the face several times.\nAccording to The Daily Beast, no one was arrested.\nThe alleged incident comes shortly after Lauren Boebert, a conservative who represents Colorado's 3rd congressional district, last month decided to abandon her reelection bid in her highly competitive reelection race and switch to the open 4th district congressional race — in what is a firmly Republican redoubt.\nLauren Boebert's district switch has received mixed reactions, with some Republicans applauding her move while others are questioning her candidacy in a district where she doesn't live or have political roots.\nLast week, she\ntold The Durango Herald she was \"protecting\" her 3rd district constituents from a Democratic takeover of the seat in 2024 by running in the redder 4th district, which was easily carried by then-President Donald Trump in 2020.\nOver the course of Lauren Boebert's roughly three-year congressional tenure,\nshe has generated headlines over her controversial statements as a lawmaker as well as the tumult in her personal life, including last year's Beetlejuice scandal where she was booted from a Denver theater over her conduct.
