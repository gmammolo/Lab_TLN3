  "text": "Gypsy Rose Blanchard Posts 'First Selfie of Freedom' Following 8 Years in Prison The selfie came a day after Blanchard was released from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri.\nBy Mark Elibert\n(Image via YouTube)\n(Image via YouTube) Gypsy Rose Blanchard has updated her Instagram page after she was released from her eight-year prison sentence .\nThe 32-year-old shared her very first selfie on the social media app on Friday, where she posed for the flick in a hotel room to celebrate her newfound freedom.\n\"First selfie of freedom!,\" Blanchard wrote in the caption.\nView this photo on Instagram Instagram: @gypsyrose_a_blanchard Blanchard's post arrived a day after she was released from the Chillicothe Correctional Center in Chillicothe, Missouri. She served eight years inside for her role in planning to murder her mother, Claudine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard, who exposed her to excessive medical treatment and made her believe she had several illnesses as a child.\nThe 32-year-old came up with the murder plot alongside her then-boyfriend Nicholas \"Nick\" Godejohn. The man went through with the crime while Blanchard stayed in the bathroom as her mother was murdered.\nDuring Blanchard's trial, it was argued that she was a victim of Munchausen syndrome —a mental disorder where a patient fakes illness to gain attention and sympathy—through her mother. In an interview with PEOPLE days before her release from prison, Blanchard explained if she had the opportunity to change the past, she would.\n\"If I had another chance to redo everything, I don't know if I would go back to when I was a child and tell my aunts and uncles that I'm not sick and mommy makes me sick, or, if I would travel back to just the point of that conversation with Nick and tell him, 'You know what, I'm going to go tell the police everything.' I kind of struggle with that,\" she said before saying she regrets her mother's death. \"Nobody will ever hear me say I'm glad she's dead or I'm proud of what I did. I regret it every single day.\"\nMore on this Barack Obama Shares His Favorite Music of 2023 Featuring Megan Thee Stallion, Tyla, Brent Faiyaz, and More tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023 Keith Lee Ranks His Favorite Food Cities, New Orleans Grabs No. 1 Spot tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023 Florida Woman Files Lawsuit Against Hershey Company for $5 Billion, Alleges False Advertising tara mahadevan · Dec. 29, 2023",
