  "text": "Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry had a vintage performance against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday at Nissan Stadium, and it might have been his final game in two-tone blue.\nHenry had a season-high 153 rushing yards on 19 carries, including a 69-yard run, and a touchdown. Tennessee upset Jacksonville 28-20 and sent the Jaguars home for the playoffs.\nHenry's contract expires at the end of this season, meaning Henry's future is in flux for the first time in several years. The 30-year-old running back spoke to Titans fans at Nissan Stadium after Sunday's game via the public-address system, thanking them for eight years of support.\nIt sure sounded like a farewell from Henry to the fans.\n\"Titans fans, I just want to say thank you for the greatest eight years of my life,\" Henry said. \"The ups and the downs, y'all have been there for everything. Through the adversity, watching me grow as a person and a player, always supporting me. I love y'all.\"\n\"I love seeing the 22 (jerseys) in the stadium,\" Henry continued. \"Hopefully I was an inspiration to all the young kids and everybody in the community. Just, thank y'all so much. God is good, and Titan up, baby.\"\nWith that, Henry jogged off the field as fans chanted \"Henry!\" as they did several times on Sunday.\nTake a look, via the Titans on X, formerly known as Twitter:\nGENTRY ESTES: If Derrick Henry's Tennessee Titans career is over, it came to a fitting end\nREPORT CARD: Tennessee Titans grades vs. Jacksonville Jaguars: Unpacking a final win for Ryan Tannehill\nIt feels like an end of an era, with Ryan Tannehill likely playing his final game as a Titan on Sunday with his contract expiring and the franchise moving forward with Will Levis as QB1. Several reports have also indicated that Mike Vrabel's future with the Titans is unclear.\nNone of the Titans' success since 2018 would have happened without Henry, who put together a possible (probable?) Hall of Fame career in five-and-a-half seasons.\nHenry ran for 238 yards and four touchdowns against the Jaguars on a Dec. 6, 2018 Thursday Night Football game, his breakout performance as a pro. It's the point of delineation in his career. In 75 games since then, Henry has totaled 7,641 rushing yards and 74 touchdowns; in 43 prior games, Henry rushed for just 1,708 yards and 15 scores.\nSunday's touchdown run was his 90th career touchdown carry, which tied him with Curtis Martin and Eric Dickerson for 13th on the all-time list. Whether or not Henry is back in Nashville next season, his greatness as a Titan will be his legacy.",
