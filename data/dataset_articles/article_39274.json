  "text": "London, Jan 7 (Prensa Latina) Varadero Beach, in Cuba, was selected as one of the 50 best in the\nworld in 2023, after an analysis that included the opinions of various experts.\nAccording to the specialized portal Las\n50 best beaches of the world, it is a list that compiles the votes of about 750 of the influential people.\nThe most recognized and experienced journalists and travel experts in the\nworld, including the Beach Ambassadors, were in charge of developing the relationship.\nVaradero, the Cuban resort, was ranked 48th on the list headed by Lucky Beach located in Australia.\nAccording to the website, it is the most accurate and best-researched summary of beaches ever collected.\nThe first ten:\n1- Navagio Beach, in Zakynthos, Greece\nNavagio Beach in Zakynthos, Greece is located in a beautiful, secluded cove surrounded by towering golden cliffs that is only accessible by boat. On the shore is the Freightliner MV Panagiotis wreck, adding another unique element to this stunning location.\n2- Playa de Whitsunday (Queensland)\nThis stunning beach is located on Queensland’s Whitsunday Islands and is only accessible by helicopter or seaplane. The contrast of the piercing white sand with the fluorescent green background of the tropical forest in the island’s mountains will leave you speechless. With over 290 days of sunshine a year and an average temperature of 27 degrees Celsius, you are sure to enjoy a soak in the sun and sand while enjoying the Coral Sea from this remote island.\n3- Hidden Beach (Marietas Islands, Mexico)\nYou can distinguish this postcard-perfect beach from the rest by one magnificent feature: those unmistakable limestone cliffs. Leaving the turquoise blue lagoon directly into the sky, they draw your eyes away from the spectacular reefs and palm tree-lined shores. Until recently, the only people who came to this remote island were the cliff-nesting swiftlets. Now, luxurious resorts invite you to spend a unique vacation.\n4- Praia do Sancho (Brazil)\nLocated on the small island of Fernando de Noronha, about an hour off the coast of Brazil, remote Praia do Sancho is one of the best beaches in the\nworld. But while its beauty is easy to appreciate, the beach itself is difficult to reach. You have to walk, slide through a dark and narrow tunnel and go down steep stairs to finally reach this beach. Furthermore, being in a national park you also have to pay to access it. However, it is definitely worth it.\n5- Tulum Beach (Quintana Roo, Mexico)\nTulum beach is a destination par excellence for travelers looking for an idyllic and serene getaway. Stunning white sands and bright blue-green waters combine to create a beach that leaves an impression on travelers. The boardwalk that runs along the beach offers a collection of bohemian-style restaurants and accommodations.\n6- Grace Bay (Turks and Caicos Islands)\nAt Grace Bay in the Turks and Caicos Islands, bright blue water laps against a white sand beach, inviting you to immerse yourself in paradise. Grace Bay is one of the most famous beaches in the\nworld for good reason. An offshore reef is home to thousands of marine animals. The reef protects the beach from powerful waves, creating a smooth surface that allows swimming and diving.\n7- Seven Mile Beach (Jamaica)\nSeven Mile Beach in Negril, Jamaica, offers an idyllic ocean scene. Palm trees leaning at 30-degree angles almost brush the sand while turquoise water flows over the beach. The island’s vegetation separates the beach from the city, creating a remote environment even though it is easily accessible.\n8-Anse Source D’Argent in Seychelles\nAnse Source D’Argent in Seychelles is the most photographed beach in the\nworld and it is not surprising because this beach with fine sand and turquoise waters is worth keeping forever in your memory. Its shore adorned with pebbles, fine sand and turquoise water delight sun and beach lovers and even more so those who like to walk about a kilometer before the ocean reaches their waist.\n9- Playa Maya Bay (Tailand)\nIt’s easy to see why this beach has been chosen as the backdrop for dozens of movies. Looking at the turquoise bay from the sand, protected by the lush mountains, the visitor feels a million miles away from everything. To get here you have to rent a boat, but it is worth the adventure for the opportunity to experience true paradise.\n10- Varadero Beach (Cuba)\nIn recent years, Cuba has become a major vacation destination thanks to its history, pastel-colored houses, and spectacular beaches. Varadero beach is the best on the island with its fine white sand bathed by blue water. Hotels lining the beach ensure impeccable accommodation and excellent luxury dining options.\n2024-01-07 21:33:08\n#Varadero #Beach #Cuba #among #\nworld #Photos",
