  "text": "Anonymous benefactor gifts $1 million to Mercyhurst Institute for Arts & Culture The Mercyhurst Institute for Arts & Culture (MIAC) begins the new year on a high note with the gift of $1 million to support its growth as a destination for world-class performing arts experiences. The benefactor, who requested remaining anonymous, said, “It is vital that students have unrestricted access to outstanding live performances as part of their Mercyhurst education. The Institute is also an invaluable asset to the Erie community. We are so fortunate to have first-class entertainment available because of MIAC and its artistic director, Dr. Brett Johnson.” In recent years, the audiences for MIAC performances have grown on a national scale. Last May, for instance, one of the world’s most popular Broadway/Hollywood/TV crossover stars, Aaron Tveit, entertained fans from 25 states and four foreign countries. Other MIAC headliners have included Martin Short, Vanessa Williams, Kristin Chenoweth, Branford Marsalis, David Sedaris, Bernadette Peters, Lily Tomlin, Pink Martini, Yamato, and the Vienna Boys Choir. Mercyhurst students have benefitted from MIAC’s exceptional offerings. Just last year, the university announced that legendary stage, screen, and television star Betty Buckley would become an artist-in-residence. She will teach workshops at the university and perform a public concert annually. “A gift of this magnitude is transformational for MIAC and will allow us to continue bringing world-class performing arts experiences to the Erie region,” Johnson said. “We are deeply grateful to the donor for this forward-thinking investment in our programming and our community.” Dr. Rich McCarty, interim vice president for academic affairs, added, “We are so grateful for this very generous gift. It is a declaration of confidence in the wholly unique offerings that MIAC provides to our students and to the region. Echoing our donor’s affirmation, MIAC is certainly a leading example of the unmatched excellence at Mercyhurst University. We look forward to welcoming all patrons back to our campus soon—not just for the entertainment, but also for the world-class education that the performing arts provide.”",
