  "text": "Stanley is the perfect setting to find some of the finest fish and chips in the state. The seaside village is popular with tourists who enjoy its charms and get hungry, breathing in the fresh salty air. Freshness is vital when preparing delicious fish and chips. That's where the Coast's family-run fishing boats come in, ensuring their catch goes straight from the deck to the fryer, then into the hot oil-smudged wrapping. Unsurprisingly, Stanley has two places on arguably the Coast's list of top five fish and chip outlets. An acclaimed furniture maker hit by a devastating warehouse fire that destroyed decades of work now runs a fish and chip shop that just won the coveted state title for best fish and chips. #1 The winner of the biennial Tasmanian Seafood 2023-2024 Best Fish and Chips is Stanley Seafoods, which Mark Bishop and his son Oliver own. It is an impressive title to win, given the father and son only opened Stanley Seafoods two years ago. \"I'd like to take credit, but winning is a testament to the wonderful team of people that work for us,\" Mark said. The Bishop's seafood business includes processing the catch served at the fish and chip shop and a truck to take to farmers' markets. Oliver goes fishing while his father, an acclaimed Tasmanian furniture maker for over three decades, runs the fish and chip side. The Bishops specialise in calamari, live wrasse primarily for the Asian market at this stage, and stripey trumpeter. \"We focus on selling fresh Tasmanian fish and only Australian fish,\" Mark said. He said the secret to cooking delicious fish and chips is \"all about the freshness\". \"Knowing where the fish comes from, how it was caught and handled, and the entire supply chain is important.\" Seven years ago, when Oliver decided to become a fisherman, his father offered to give him a hand. \"I did that and made furniture for a while, but unfortunately, my workshop burnt down three years ago in a warehouse complex. The whole place went up,\" Mark said. It's still a shocking memory to have lost \"35 years worth of stuff\" in the fire. \"You feel for people who lose everything in bushfires. Now I know exactly how they feel,\" he said. The talented creator, driven by his DNA to excel, was always particular about creating furniture and food. He opened a small fish shop with three partners to start selling their catch, which took off. After COVID happened the seafood industry, like so many others, went into freefall. \"It was tumultuous; we lost our wholesale markets because restaurants closed,\" Mark said. The Bishops became the sole operators, and when the cafe upstairs closed, decided to open their fish and chip shop. \"We also sell fresh fish at farmers' markets along the Coast and do a fish run down the West Coast every fortnight.\" #2 Stanley institution Hursey Seafoods won the Tasmanian Seafoods 2023-2024 Tassie Seafood Award after catching and serving seafood for over 35 years. The family-owned and operated business was established by Jim and Val Hursey, starting with fish sales and a truck, and grew to include a fleet of signature red vessels offering residents and tourists the chance to taste fresh Tassie seafood, including the famous southern rock lobster. The iconic seafood restaurant, takeaway and fresh fish sales venue underwent a $1.5 million revamp in 2022. \"From our fleet to our plate is what we pride ourselves on,\" Steven Hursey said then. #3 Strait off the Boat in Devonport Experienced fisherman of 45 years, Craig Rowlings and his wife Judy own the Strait off the Boat fish and chip shop. Mr Rowlings catches the fish on his boat, the Mary H, while Judy and her team cook it at their shop on Forbes Street. When you see another well-known figure from the fishing industry buying a feed of fish and chips, it's already a good sign. The Rowlings decided to open the shop 12 years ago to sell their freshly caught Bass Strait gummy and the bycatch. Their customers no longer ask for \"flake and chips\". Instead, they ask for the type of fish they want: either the Bass Strait gummy, saw shark, elephant fish, Tassie Scallops, pink ling or blue eye. Mrs Rowlings said the secret to cooking great fish and chips is fresh seafood and a crispy batter. \"You need a cold batter so it becomes crispy and fresh oil,\" she said. She also advises that the quality of oil used is important. \"The older the oil, the soggier the chips will be,\" she said. #4 Wynyard Seafoods on the Wharf ranked second in the Tasmanian top 30 at the Australian Fish and Chip Awards in 2018 and is recently under new ownership. The picturesque Wynyard wharf has been home to a fish and chip shop for about 40 years, with people travelling to the town to enjoy the setting and a meal of fish and chips. #5 The Foreshore in Burnie and Drift in Devonport are fortunate to operate eateries from stunning beachside locations minutes from their city CBDS. Both serve locally sourced fish and chips. ",
