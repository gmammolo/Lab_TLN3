Of them, 99,890 votes were valid.\nAmong the other candidates, independent candidate Abul Kashem Fakhrul Islam received 370 votes with truck symbol, M Moniruzzaman, who stepped down from the electoral race, got 625 votes with eagle symbol, Bangladesh Congress Party candidate Mojibur Rahman 142 votes with coconut symbol, Trinamool BNP candidate Jasim Uddin Talukder 282 votes with golden fiber symbol.\nMeanwhile, Jatiya Party candidate Ejajul Haque received 1,272 votes.\nShahjahan Omar was the vice-chairman of BNP and serving jail in a sabotage case.
