  "text": "Andrew Nelles / The Tennessean / USA TODAY NETWORK\nAfter leading the Tennessee Titans to a win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in what could be his last game with the team, Derrick Henry expressed his appreciation for the fans who have supported him.\nHenry fittingly torched the Jaguars to the tune of 153 yards and a touchdown in the 28-20 victory, which also knocked Jacksonville out of the playoffs in what is a hugely disappointing result for Tennessee’s division rival.\nAs far as Henry’s future is concerned, it isn’t clear if the Titans will bring one of the best players in franchise history back for another season. The Alabama product made one hell of a case they should on Sunday.\nAfter the game, Henry was given the mic on the field and had a message for Titans fans. He sure sounded like someone who doesn’t expect to be back in 2024.\n“Titans fans, I want to thank you for the eight greatest years of my life,” he said, per The Athletic’s Joe Rexrode.\nYou can check out his full speech below.\n“Thank you for the greatest 8 years of my life”\n-Derrick Henry thanks @Titans fans after his last potential game as a Titan 👑 pic.twitter.com/aSuERdlSFj\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 7, 2024\nThank you, 22.\nMore Latest News\nDerrick Henry, Titans end Jaguars’ season with 28-20 win\nTitans RB Derrick Henry breaks franchise record vs. Jags\nTitans vs. Jaguars inactives for Week 18: Who’s in, who’s out?\nTitans can end Jaguars’ season with Week 18 win\nMore details on Mike Vrabel, Titans situation ahead of offseason\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Derrick Henry thanks Titans fans ‘for the 8 greatest years of my life’",
