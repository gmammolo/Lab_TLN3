  "text": "2024-01-07 20:46:00\nThe future of the brazilian team begins to become clearer regarding the choice of his new coach, since the press of that country assured that Dorival Junior will become the substitute for Fernando Diniz in office.\nThe portal\nGlobe Sports He even reported that the Copa Libertadores champion with Flamengo and who led Sao Paulo in recent months accepted the proposal of the Brazilian Confederation to take office.\n“The main objective of the CBF after the dismissal of Fernando Diniz, Dorival Júnior, received the first contacts from Ednaldo in recent days and liked what he heard. The coach always had the dream of coaching the national team and he let himself be carried away by the opportunity,” says the aforementioned media.\nIt is even mentioned in the information that Dorival has already communicated his decision to the Sao Paulo leadership and will say goodbye to the team this Monday.\nBrazil was left without a coach after the departure of Fernando Diniz last Fridaywho was dismissed due to the poor results achieved in the South American Qualifiers, where “Scratch” is sixth with seven points after six dates played.\nFurthermore, his main letter to the bank, the Italian Carlo Ancelotti, ruled out the alternative and renewed his contract with Real Madrid.\n1704666671\n#Dorival #appears #coach #Brazil",
