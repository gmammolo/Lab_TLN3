  "text": "READ MORE: Influencer bride Ellie Gonsalves is forced to deny she trashed her wedding venue and got kicked out\nShe recently made headlines around the world for her viral list citing 118 reasons she doesn’t want kids.\nAnd Ellie Gonsalves raised eyebrows for a very different reason on Sunday, when the model stepped out at Magic Millions on the Gold Coast.\nThe 34-year-old cloaked her sensational figure in a flattering white dress as she joined the celebrities at the illustrious thoroughbred racehorse auction.\nShe accessorised with silver heels and a matching silver purse slung over her right shoulder.\nGonsalves wore her peroxide tresses in a slicked-back pixie cut for the high profile outing and applied the finishing touches to her makeup with a smokey-eye look.\nEllie Gonsalves recently made headlines around the world for her viral list citing 118 reasons she doesn’t want kids. Pictured on Sunday\nOn Christmas Day, the model and actress shared a list of things not to ask and say at Christmas, including questions not to ask childless women.\n‘STFU ABOUT THESE [ON THE] HOLIDAYS’ she began, with her first no-go topic being: ‘When are you having kids?’\nOther questions include, ‘When are you getting married?’ and ‘When are you going to start trying for another baby?’\nShe also suggested not asking when a person’s partner plans to propose, and not being homophobic towards gay family members.\nGonsalves raised eyebrows for a very different reason last weekend when the model stepped out at Magic Millions on the Gold Coast\nThe actress also recommended not slating the gifts or food on offer, and not mentioning family fights.\nEllie recently shared some of the troll comments she has received via her Instagram DMs after listing 118 reasons she does not want children.\nShe posted a screen shot of a message she got on Instagram Stories which read: ‘You’ll also most likely die alone with no one by your side.’\nEllie replied: ‘What’s gonna stop you from dying alone? Lol having kids isn’t an insurance policy against loneliness. Get some friends for Christ sake’.\nAppearing on The Project, the Australian reality star said she is not phased by the anger, and thinks it’s important women discuss the issue openly.\nOn Christmas Day, the model and actress shared a list of things not to ask and say at Christmas, including questions not to ask childless women\n‘I think the backlash that comes along with someone being so honest and candid about it is terrifying to people,’ she said.\n‘I found it very strange that people don’t talk about it but you see what’s happened in the last 24 hours since I’ve shared this list and it has literally been on every major news outlet in Australia.\n‘So the backlash that comes along with that and the vilification and the judgement, I think is scary to a lot of people’.\nDespite the criticism, Ellie is sticking to her guns in the hopes that she can help other women.\n‘I have been called everything under the sun over my entire career and it’s like water off a duck’s back for me. But for a lot of people it’s very scary,’ she said.\n‘STFU ABOUT THESE [ON THE] HOLIDAYS’ she began, with her first no-go topic being: ‘When are you having kids?’\n‘So if I’m that person that can have a voice and make people feel seen and heard who feel the way that I do then that’s amazing.’\nThe actress said she was inspired to start her own list after seeing TikTok user Girl With The List go viral on the video platform with her own collection of reasons.\nEllie earlier broke her silence about the backlash she received over her controversial list.\nThe 32-year-old divided the internet after sharing 118 reasons she does not want children to Instagram.\nWhat followed was a wave of hatred levelled against the actress.\n‘I have already received hundreds of DMs criticising me, telling me how much of a horrible and broken person I am. But lots of these fears/thoughts ARE real,’ she told Mamamia.\n‘They resonate with not only me but with so many other women. A lot of them are small things that contribute towards a much bigger picture.’\nShe added the messages she received questioning the list only furthered her resolve, as it showed some people felt threatened by others choosing to live an alternative lifestyle.\n‘They further illustrate my main point: people are sold a certain life, and when they witness others choosing a different path, the frustration lies within themselves.’\nEllie then said she had also received several positive messages from fans praising her for speaking out her desire to remain childfree.\nEllie is outspoken about being childfree by choice, and revealed she received a host of nasty DMs upon sharing the list to Instagram on Sunday. Pictured: Ellie and her husband Ross Scutts\nEllie married her long-term partner, entrepreneur Ross Scutts, in two luxury ceremonies back in March.\nThe official nuptials took place at the floating beach club La Luna on the Gold Coast in an intimate toi et moi wedding.\nThey followed it up with a second luxury gathering where they invited their bridal party and other guests.\nThe couple, who have been together for 15 years, have been vocal about not wanting to have children.",
