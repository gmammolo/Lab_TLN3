Read full article Sam Goodwin · Sports Editor 7 January 2024 at 10:17 pm · 4-min read Ellyse Perry starred for Australia in their win over India in the second T20. Image: Getty\nEllyse Perry has celebrated her 300th game in international cricket in fitting fashion, top-scoring and hitting the winning six as Australia beat India in the second T20. Perry made 32 not out off 21 balls on Sunday night, getting Australia home with an over to spare as they chased down India's total of 8-130.\nThe all-rounder hit two sixes and three fours in a classy innings, with her fifth-wicket stand with Phoebe Litchfield getting the Aussies across the line and levelling the series 1-1. Perry blasted a slog-sweep over the mid-wicket boundary to score the winning runs - the perfect way to cap off her 300th match for Australia across all formats.\n'LOT OF SUPPORT': David Warner statue question emerges after Test farewell\n'RIDICULOUS': Cricket world slams baffling move that helped David Warner\n\"It's lovely to get the win...a nice comeback for us,\" Perry said. \"We got a bit of a what-for the other night. It was a superb bowling effort in the first innings. Kim (Garth) was sensational up front. Wickets are crucial in that power play. It was a difficult chase but a nice finish.\"\nAlyssa Healy had put India in to bat after winning the toss, knowing that dewy conditions later in the match would make it easier for the Aussie batters. India could only muster 8-130 off their 20 overs, with only Deepti Sharma, run out off the last ball for 30, scoring more than 23.\nGeorgia Wareham and Annabel Sutherland were the pick of the Aussie bowlers, taking two wickets apiece for 18 and 17 runs respectively off their four overs. Garth was recalled for the match at the expense of Darcie Brown, and the Irish-born bowler immediately justified the decision.\nShe snared 2-27, dismissing the dangerous Shafali Verma and Jeminah Rodrigues. The only blot on Australia's performance was a dropped catch from Garth in the last over, which denied Megan Schutt what would have been a record 131st wicket in T20 internationals. She remains level with Pakistan player Nida Dar on 130 after taking 0-29 on Sunday.\nStory continues Ellyse Perry celebrates with Phoebe Litchfield after Australia's win over India in the second T20. (Photo by Pankaj Nangia/Getty Images) (Getty Images) Australia made a confident start in their run chase, cruising to 0-51 off seven overs. Healy holed out to deep mid-on for 26 off 21, and opening partner Beth Mooney fell two overs later for 20 off 29. Tahlia McGrath went for 19 off 21 balls, and when Ash Gardner was dismissed for seven India began to hope.\nThe Aussies were 4-99 with 34 needed of 26 balls. But Perry extinguished India's hopes to get her side to victory. Fans were delighted for the Aussie star in her 300th match.\nWhat a way to enjoy her 300 match in style!! Finished with 6 and won the match too!!\n— *",
