  "text": "The developers of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden are increasingly introducing players to their project by releasing new trailers. After several videos demonstrating the combat system and rituals, the authors decided to introduce players to the creatures that will confront the main characters. The new trailer for Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden below is called “Bestiary” and it shows off some of the creatures from the game. Let us remember that the events of the project themselves take place in 1695 in the North American outback of New Eden. The main characters are ghost hunters, one of whom himself left the world of the living and became a spirit. As you can see in the new trailer, the main characters will be confronted by a variety of ghosts and monsters, and to defeat them you will need to seek an individual approach. Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden will be released on February 13th on Xbox Series X | S, Playstation 5 and PC. The game is a single-player adventure; there are no multiplayer options.",
