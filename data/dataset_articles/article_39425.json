  "text": "The Tennessee Titans finished their season off on a high note with a win over the Jacksonville Jaguars at home, and head coach Mike Vrabel was asked about the emotions of his team after the win, which knocked out the Jaguars and helped a number of other teams clinch playoff spots. “Well I mean I think that they’ll be able to give you their emotion,” Mike Vrabel said, via Jim Wyatt of the Titans. “But I think its… you know there’s a lot of satisfaction to be able to play a game this late in the season that doesn’t have playoff implications, division implications for us. And to prepare that the way they did, to come out here and compete the way they competed. I always tell you, the credit goes to the players. They were the ones that allowed us to run the football, allowed us to give up a play and come back and get stops in the red zone. Told them at half time. You’re the best red zone defense in the league, and we’re gonna need a stop to win the game. And that’s what they did. And so, all the credit goes to the players, to the coaches for getting them prepared. I’m sure they’re excited like everybody else.” #Titans HC Mike Vrabel on the win over the @Jaguars. pic.twitter.com/KDwAQEargh — Jim Wyatt (@jwyattsports) January 7, 2024 The Titans finish the season with a 6-11 record, and will look to rebound next offseason with a team that might look very different. We will wait and see if Vrabel will be retained. Will Levis will likely be the full-time starter, and Derrick Henry seems likely to leave in free agency. It will be interesting to see what changes come to the Titans organization this offseason.",
