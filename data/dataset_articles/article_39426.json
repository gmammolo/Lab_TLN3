  "text": "FOXBORO, Mass. —\nTom Brady unzipped his New England Patriots sweatshirt to reveal he was wearing his old No. 12 jersey, then did his customary sprint down the sideline to kick off the team’s halftime celebration, shouting “Let’s go!” once he reached the end zone just as he did before every game at Gillette Stadium.\nAdvertisement\nDuring an 11-minute event on the field during the team’s season opener against the\nPhiladelphia Eagles, Brady pronounced that he considers himself “a Patriot for life,” and owner Robert Kraft announced that the team will waive its four-year waiting period for consideration into the Patriots Hall of Fame to enshrine Brady early.\nKraft said the\nPatriots will hold a one-day ceremony recognizing Brady on June 12, 2024, (the date chosen to reflect Brady’s jersey number) and enshrine him. It will be the first https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/patriots/ enshrinement held inside Gillette Stadium to allow for 60,000-plus fans to attend.\n“When\nhttps://theathletic.com/nfl/player/tom-brady-d0I2fPFxqMjAsfgz/ announced his retirement after 23 NFL seasons, there was only one place I wanted him to be on opening day — right here at Gillette Stadium, with 65,000 of his closest friends,” Kraft said. “Patriots fans didn’t get an opportunity to appropriately thank Tom when he left. I wanted to give them that opportunity. Unfortunately, a halftime ceremony just doesn’t provide enough time to honor Tommy the way he deserves.”\n.\n[@TomBrady]halftime ceremony from [@GilletteStadium]. [#PHIvsNE]on [@NFLonCBS] [pic.twitter.com/DcX6ZnznEY]\n— New England Patriots (@Patriots)\n[September 10, 2023]\nAfter Kraft introduced Brady by proclaiming there was nowhere else Brady should spend his first football Sunday in retirement, Brady spoke for five minutes. He thanked the New England fans, reflected on his time winning six Super Bowls with the Patriots, and said during that period the Pats only cared about two things — each other and winning.\n“If you did not care about those two things,” Brady said, “you didn’t last here very long.”\nBrady said he considered himself lucky to be drafted by the Patriots. After his run with New England, Brady won another Super Bowl in his three years with the\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nAdvertisement\nBut upon his return Sunday, Brady said: “One thing I am sure of, and that will never change, is that I am a Patriot for life.”\n(Photo: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images)",
