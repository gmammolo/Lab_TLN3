Darby had just drained a 3-pointer to tie the game in the third quarter against Kentucky on Sunday, but Tennessee's 11-0 run was fueled with back-to-back blocks from Key. The second block from the senior center shut down Kentucky's Ajae Petty, who seemed unstoppable in a dominant first half for the Wildcats. The run gave [Lady Vols basketball](https://www.knoxnews.com/sports/womens-basketball/) all the momentum against Kentucky, erasing a 17-point first-half deficit to crush the Wildcats 87-69 at Thompson-Boling Arena at Food City Center. Key finished with a season-high six blocks and added two points and two rebounds. Tennessee trailed 49-39 at halftime and outscored Kentucky 48-20 in the second half. Senior forward Rickea Jackson had a game-high 27 points against Kentucky (8-8, 1-1) and went 11-for-18 shooting. She added seven rebounds, three assists and a steal. Tennessee (9-5, 2-0- SEC) is 5-1 with Jackson in the lineup this season and has won five straight. Tennessee struggles on defense, boards in first half Kentucky guard Eniya Russell, who was 3-for-14 from 3-point range entering Sunday, drained a 3-pointer three minutes before halftime to give the Wildcats a 17-point lead.

It had seven in the first quarter, three of them by point guard Jasmine Powell. The Lady Vols had 10 turnovers by halftime. Jackson had five by halftime, two resulting from a travel violation and a charge. Tennessee got its turnovers under control in the second half and ended with 16. Jewel Spear turns momentum for Tennessee Senior guard Jewel Spear was a bright spot as Tennessee struggled in the first half.

Spear had 11 points in the second, going 3-for-3 from the field and 4-for-4 from the free-throw line. Her 3-pointer cut the lead to 10 points near the end of the quarter, and her poise was crucial for Tennessee.
