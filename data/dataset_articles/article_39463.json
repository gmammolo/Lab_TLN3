  "text": "Into Champagne (Into Mischief) debuted a 6 3/4-length winner last summer when the Churchill Downs meet was forced to shift to Ellis Park. Returning to the worktab in early November after nearly a five-month break, the filly was well-backed as the 3-5 choice.\nTracking Let Them Watch (Maximus Mischief) from the second flight along the rail, the 3-year-old bided her time under a firm hold into the far turn. With a half-mile of :45.91, at the quarter pole the bay uncorked her speed and she celebrated with a professional performance by 1 1/4 lengths over Launch (Omaha Beach).\n“I'm all about developing horses,” said trainer Ian Wilkes. “I like to use riders who'll stay with the horse. Julien [Leparoux] was quite happy and wanted to stay with her, and he was willing to come down, so that was the thing. It's all about developing horses and trying to win the right races.”\nThe winner's dam is responsible for a 2-year-old filly by\n<a href=\"http://www.taylormadestallions.com/horses/not-this-time-31064.html\n\">Not This Time</a>.
