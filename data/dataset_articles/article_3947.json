  "text": "Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has come to the rescue of Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University, which was facing property attachment under a local court’s order for failure to pay Rs 11.54 crore compensation for land it acquired in late 1980s for the university in Patan town. To save its movable properties from being attached after the court’s warrant, the university immediately deposited the amount with the court. But it rushed to the high court seeking a stay on disbursement of the amount by the lower court. The high court has stayed the disbursement and issued notice to the family, which is seeking to extract the compensation amount, and the deputy collector and posted further hearing on January 15. This case involves descendants of one Yusuf Nanadoliya, who lost his land in the tracts acquired for HNGU in 1988 in Samalpati village, adjacent to Patan town. The dispute regarding compensation has been underway since then. The compensation amount was fixed in 2015 and the amount was disbursed among claimants through court orders. The principal senior civil judge issued an attachment warrant against the university, when the Nandoliya family demanded execution of the compensation order. The attachment process began the next day resulting in the university depositing the full amount with the court. According to universities counsels Prakash Jani and Nishit Gandhi, the amount is not Rs 11.54 crore as claimed by the family, but Rs 1.41 crore, if proper calculation is made by considering provisions of Section 23 (1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act and considering a stay that was operative between 1988 and 1994. Moreover, this amount is to be paid by the state government and not by the university. The executing court issued attachment warrant without verifying the legitimate claim of the family. The university has sought to quash the warrant of attachment issued by the lower court. The lawyers submitted that after depositing the amount, the university requested the lower court not to disburse the money for a week, but its request was rejected. They urged for urgent stay order from the HC, which the university got earlier this week.",
