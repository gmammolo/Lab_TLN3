  "text": "Sunday marked the birth anniversary of late and legendary actor Irrfan Khan. He was born on January 7, 1967 in India. He was one of the finest actors in Hindi cinema and unfortunately passed away in April 2020. If he were alive, he would have turned 57 today. Irrfan had an illustrious career that lasted for over 30 years. He not only acted in Bollywood films but also worked on various international projects like The Darjeeling Limited, Slumdog Millionaire, The Amazing Spider-Man, Life Of Pi, Jurassic World, Inferno and many others. Interestingly, Irrfan was even approached for a role in Christopher Nolan’s 2014 film Interstellar. However, he turned down the offer and once shared the reason behind his decision. He had to turn down the opportunity due to scheduling issues. Taking up the role would have meant staying back in the US for a stretch of four months. Irrfan revealed that it wouldn’t have been possible for him to stay there for so long, as he wanted to be in India for The Lunchbox and D-Day. In a throwback interview with Times of India, Irrfan Khan had said, “They expected a huge commitment from my end. I had to stay in the US for four months at a stretch. I tried to work out my schedule and suggested if I could shuttle between India and the US as it wouldn’t have been possible for me to be there for that long. I wanted to be here for The Lunchbox and D-Day. They couldn’t allow that.” He mentioned that he didn’t have a tendency to regret decisions, but knowing that it was a Christopher Nolan film, this was one of the most difficult decisions he had to make. Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi action film Interstellar is one of his biggest blockbuster releases. The movie starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Matt Damon was loved by audience and critics alike.",
