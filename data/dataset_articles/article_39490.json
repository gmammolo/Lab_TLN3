  "text": "Match-winner Porro claims first Player of the Match award Sun 07 January 2024, 22:30|Tottenham Hotspur Pedro Porro has been named our supporters' HSBC Player of the Match after he scored the stunning match-winner in our FA Cup third round triumph over Burnley on Friday night. Claiming his maiden Player of the Match award of the season, Pedro took a whopping 70 per cent of the vote in an exclusive poll on our [official app](https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/official-spurs-stadium-app/) straight after the game. In a game of few clear cut opportunities, it was always going to take something special to separate us and Burnley - and Pedro was the man to produce it. A player who produced strong performances week after week so far this season as he has really grown in a Spurs shirt, he took the tie with the Clarets by the scruff of the neck and was at the heart of everything good that we did on the attack - while he also produced a number of critical blocks and tackles at the other end. His standout moment, though, came with 12 minutes of the game remaining as, when he picked the ball up 25 yards out from goal on the right, he strode towards the target before unleashing a fierce swerving effort which looped into the top of the left-hand corner of the net. A goal good enough to win any match!
