  "text": "Call the Midwife season 13 episode 1 spoilers follow.Call the Midwife ushers in season 13 with a sucker punch of an episode. The emotionally charged debut put Nonnatus' newest trainee recruits, Joyce (Renee Bailey) and Rosalind (Natalie Quarry) through their paces. More specifically Rosalind, whose experience was like a breach birth: arduous, painful and potentially dangerous. However it reaped many rewards when she managed to help deliver her first Poplar baby in a barricaded room to avoid further gunshots from the father. We kid you not. As season debuts go, Rosalind's dramatic beginning in midwifery threatened to steal the show, however it was Sister Julienne's interwoven journey with mother-to-be Doreen Chalice (Rosie Jones) that resonated the most. The stigma of being unmarried and pregnant is a storyline that has been explored in Call the Midwife several times with great success. However, despite this being Doreen's set of circumstances, the usual social ramifications that go hand-in-hand with such a situation were steam-rolled over by the fact that she is disabled. Having hidden the pregnancy from her family, save her sister, Doreen was forced into confession when Dr Turner (Stephen McGann) informed her that her due date was rapidly approaching. Doreen's conversation with her mother Ada went much the way she expected, with talk quickly steering towards her inability to care for her child because of her cerebral palsy and physical impairments, which have left her wheelchair bound and with limited function of her arms.From her mother's shock and concern emerged a different kind of stigma that even today crops up when considering a disabled person's access to everyday life experiences. Ada's rollercoaster of emotions swayed back and forth from feeling like she somehow failed in protecting her daughter to underestimating Doreen, to even the presumption that she has been sexually assaulted.\\\"You're not well, Doreen. You were born not well. You need looking after, not molesting,\\\" were her exact words. Doreen fought hard to firmly advocate for herself and her relationship with piano tuner boyfriend Graham, however it wasn't until Graham emerged on the scene in support of Doreen that there is even a glimmer of a shift in Ada's thinking. With Graham standing by her daughter's side Ada was able to consider that maybe Doreen was capable of more autonomy in her life than she had been granted thus far. The fact that Graham's presence was necessary to give validation to Doreen's words further underscores how underestimated she was. Ada wasn't the only one who struggled not to see Doreen as a disability first, person second. Sister Julienne (Jenny Agutter) also went on quite the journey, which started with overt pity.\\\"I don't think I've ever seen an expectant mother with such a degree of brain damage,\\\" she told Miss Higgins, who was quick to champion Doreen when she replied:\\\"She strikes me as being very bright and sensible.\\\" Naturally Sister Julienne agreed but that didn't stop her from feeling devastated when she discovered that she was the midwife to deliver Doreen, especially when considering Doreen's earlier words: \\\"I am the way I am because of lack of oxygen at birth.\\\" Sister Julienne was awash with guilt. She felt responsible for the difficult life Doreen was leading and yet while she cried and pitied Doreen, the expectant mother was beaming joyously having just received an engagement ring from Graham. Those mirrored experiences, Sister Julienne's grief flush up against Doreen's elation, speak to how easy it can be to let one's compassion devalue the joy in a differently abled person's life, simply because it is different. By feeling such sorrow for Doreen, Sister Julienne overlooked how blessed and happy Doreen felt and in turn inadvertently devalued her life experiences by assuming they have been lesser or dampened by her disability.It wasn't until Sister Julienne received absolution from Ada, who thanked her for saving Doreen at birth, that she was able to shed some of her guilt.The rest of her absolution later came from Doreen who was finally able to change the way both the Sister and her mother viewed her when she told them: \\\"I don't want anyone to see me as something broken because I'm not. \\\"I break things, sometimes cups, sometimes promises and now I break people's ideas of what a girl like me can do and have or be.\\\"Her powerful words are meaningfully received, especially by Sister Julienne, who replied:\\\"If ever I saw you as less than you are, I know better now.\\\" Fans of the show are no doubt used to Sister Julienne being the one to give wisdom and guidance and so it is always refreshing when we see growth in her character too. However the creator's intention behind this storyline was no doubt that her learnings would also translate off screen too.Society often has preconceived ideas of what a disabled person can and can't achieve based on a lack of understanding and an inability to look beyond a disability to the individual. Doreen's experience is a bright and fresh reminder not to impose restrictions based on what a disabled person can't do but to hone in on what they can, lending support for their aspirations and dreams instead of curbing them.Call the Midwife season 13 airs on Sunday BBC One 8pm and streams on BBC iPlayer.",
