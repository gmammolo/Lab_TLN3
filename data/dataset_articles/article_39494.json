  "text": "The Czechoslovak fantasy series Arabela from 1980 enchanted the audience not only with its fairy tale [world](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/world/), but also thanks to its great cast. In thirteen episodes, we could see prominent actors such as Vladimír Menšík, Stella Zázvorková, Jana Brejchová, Vlastimil Brodský, Jiří Sovák, Jiří Lábus, Dáda Patrasová or Jana Nagyová. The ten-year-old Veronika Týblová-Polívková also appeared in the role of little Mařenka. She was born in 1970 in Jablonec nad Nisou and at the age of eight she found herself in the public eye thanks to her performance in the fairy tale The Cat Prince. Although Veronika Týblová-Polívková does not come from an acting family, her teacher then recommended her to the crew for an audition. In the end, Žaneta Fuchsová got the role she aspired for in The Cat Prince, but little Veronika got a supporting role. A year later, she was chosen for Arabela, where we still vividly remember her as the chubby Mařenka. Filming lasted a whole year, and today he describes it as a long vacation, full of adventures and star-studded meetings with important figures of the film [world](https://www.world-today-news.com/category/world/) at the time. After Arabela, she also starred in the series Ein Stück Himmel and in the films Potrhlá Andula or Petra a Pavla. “I don’t consider myself an actress. I consider myself a child who was chosen, at that time I was what they needed me to be. I wasn’t shy, I was probably direct, I was such a devil. And who could have guessed that the series would be so incredibly successful” she revealed in an interview for Stream.cz.

The offer to act in a film with a pro-regime subtext was ultimately the reason why Veronika Týblová-Polívková ended her film career at the age of thirteen. Instead, she studied at the gymnasium and later at the Faculty of Education. Today she lives in Černý most in Prague, where she works as a teacher in the first grade of an elementary school. If she wasn’t a teacher, she would definitely be able to imagine herself as an actress even today. However, she revealed that she loves her teaching profession: “I just love being in that classroom with those kids and basically playing there too.” To be continued Arabela Returns or Rumburak King of the Fairytale Realm from 1993, Veronika did not play anymore. Hana Igonda Ševčíková played the role of the adult Mařenka alongside Ondřej Kepka. The series Arabela has been broadcast every Sunday in the early evening on Nova [TV](https://www.world-today-news.com/tag/tv/) since January 7. 2024-01-07 17:39:12 #Chubby #Mařenka #Arabela #years #satisfied #profession #quit #acting #thirteen",
