  "text": "Veteran Ellyse Perry played a special knock on her 300th International game as her 34 runs ensured that the visitors stay alive in the series. Apart from Perry, Alyssa Healy Beth Mooney and Phoebe Litchfield played decent knocks for the visiting side on Sunday (January 7). Speaking about the first innings, Deepti Sharma top-scored for the home side as she scored 30 runs. Smriti Mandhana and Richa Ghosh also got decent starts with the bat but they failed to make a big score. As a result, Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. posted 130 runs in their allotted 20 overs.

Probably just doing my job in the end, but yeah, a nice comeback for us. India played well in the last game. So for us to come back and put in such a bowling effort there in the first innings and it was a difficult chase, but nice to finish. Phoebe in the end there was sensational,” said Ellyse Perry after the match.",
