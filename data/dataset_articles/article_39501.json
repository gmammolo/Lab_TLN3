  "text": "New Florida legislation filed in favor of homeowners against HOAs State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. State Rep. Kristen Arrington is hoping the second time is the charm for two bills she has filed again regarding homeowners' rights against their HOAs. HB 59 gives all homeowners a one-time notification of their rules, restrictions, and covenants, making sure they know what they’re working with. State Sen. Linda Stewart is sponsoring the bill in the Senate. HB 431, which is being sponsored by Florida Sen. Victor Torres, would cap fines for violations to $500. “Currently it’s $1,000, and when I was elected in 2020 during COVID, it was brought to my attention, there was a senior citizen who needed to pressure wash her driveway. She had a hard time, like many of us, getting people to do work and between supply chain issues and people having COVID, she wasn’t able to take care of the situation and her fines went up to $1,000 and for someone on a fixed income, we just don’t want to do that to them,” Arrington said. The new cap is just the latest of several bills Torres has filed regarding HOAs since he’s been in the Senate. “The fine for me is excessive and I think fine after fine, it mounts up and they can put a lien on your home and then guess what? If the homeowner wants to sell or the homeowner passes away, you have those liens you have to clear up first,” Torres said. Two years ago, Arrington and Torres filed legislation to get rid of fines completely. They said they got some backlash on that regarding lack of enforcement. Arrington said she’s welcoming input from the public on their experiences with their HOAs, to help support the bills. To share your story, email her at kristen.arrington@myfloridahouse.gov.",
