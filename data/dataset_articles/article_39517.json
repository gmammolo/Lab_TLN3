  "text": "Watch Now: Ridder completed 22 of 30 passes for 291 yards with two touchdowns and one interception and netted no gain on two carries in the Falcons ' 48-17 loss to the Saints on Sunday. He also lost a fumble.\nThe two turnovers were naturally a blemish, but Ridder otherwise put together some encouraging numbers that included an elevated 9.7 yards per attempt, his second-highest figure of the season. Ridder connected with Jonnu Smith and and Bijan Robinson for touchdown tosses of 15 and 71 yards, respectively, for only his second multi-touchdown performance of his second season, and Sunday's production pushed the sophomore signal-caller's final numbers to 2,836 passing yards and a 12:12 TD:INT over 15 games. Both Ridder and the Falcons as a whole head into the offseason with plenty of uncertainty, and it seems likely that the young signal-caller will either find himself in a new locale or playing for a new coaching staff with Atlanta in 2024.\nMore News Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Will start Week 18 6H ago • by RotoWire Staff Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Loses grip on starting gig 19D ago • by RotoWire Staff Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Underwhelming in Week 15 loss 21D ago • by RotoWire Staff Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Career-high yardage tally in loss 28D ago • by RotoWire Staff Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Struggles in low-scoring win 12/03/2023 • by RotoWire Staff Falcons' Desmond Ridder: Mistake-prone in return 11/26/2023 • by RotoWire Staff Our Latest Fantasy Football Stories Week 18 Fantasy football: QB, RB, WR, TE rankings CBS Sports Staff • 6 min read Injury Report: Who's in, who's out?
