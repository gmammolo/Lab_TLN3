  "text": "ROCKINGHAM — After not playing for nearly a month, the Richmond Senior High School junior varsity girls’ basketball team held on for a win Friday. A strong first half helped the JV Lady Raiders, who dealt with injuries in the second half, earn a 47-43 victory at home over Hoke County High School. The JV Lady Raiders rolled out to a 27-16 lead at halftime, but were outscored 27-20 in the final two quarters. The 11-point cushion at the break proved to be enough. Freshman Kaniah Little was Richmond’s leading scorer with 23 points. Sophomore Olivia Brown had 14 points. All six players scored in the win, including four points from freshman Iyana Little. Freshmen Kenya Bailey, Audicy Rush and Ny’Aziah Wilson each scored two points. “The girls played a great first half,” head coach Tonia Breeden said. “The second half they battled through injuries and cramps. At one time we only had four on the floor because two players couldn’t go. “I’m proud of how they didn’t throw in the towel and played through,” she added. “Kaniah had a great game even though she rolled her ankle. She didn’t quit. All six players scored and contributed to the win.” A 17-9 run opened the first quarter for Richmond. Kaniah Little scored her first 10 points on four field goals and two free throws. Adding to the strong start, Brown had her first five points and Rush scored her two points in the game. A closer second quarter led to a 10-7 scoring stretch by the home team. Kaniah Little and Iyana Little each dropped a pair of buckets for four points and Brown netted a basket to give her seven at the break. The only quarter Richmond didn’t outscore the JV Lady Bucks was the third. Hoke County went on a 15-7 spurt to cut its deficit to 34-31. Four points from Brown, a basket by Wilson and one free throw courtesy of Kaniah Little accounted for the JV Lady Raiders’ third-quarter scoring. Helping put the game away in the final eight minutes, Kaniah Little finished her big night with her final eight points, all on field goals. Brown hit another shot from the line to go with a bucket and Bailey chipped in her two points. The JV Lady Raiders (4-2, 2-0 SAC) will host Union Pines High School Tuesday at 5 p.m.",
