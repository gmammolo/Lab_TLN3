  "text": "As we all know, Stanley tumblers have become the next big thing.\nConsidering their latest tumbler duo for Valentine’s Day sold out at Target, it’s safe to say that Stanley isn’t moving over on the shelf… and we don’t want it too!\nBut your Stanley tumbler at home, needs a friend.\nThe Stanley company, well known for its aesthetically pleasing tumblers, also have a slew of other items that are perfect for on the go trips!\nAdding food bowls and jars to their resume list, Stanley has created to-go food containers that are efficient and just as pretty as their tumblers, because we all know, looks are everything.\nWe know what you’re thinking, matching one of these food containers to your tumbler at home would be the perfect scenario for your home office.\nWhile both the bowls and jars include a double-wall vacuum insulation to keep your lunches, snacks or maybe even dinner at just the right temperature, you can also count on stuffing these containers with hot and cold foods.\nYou can\nfind Stanley’s on the go food jars and bowls currently stocked on Target store shelves.\nAnd if they’re anything like their tumblers, we suggest rerouting your GPS to the retail store on your way home from work.",
