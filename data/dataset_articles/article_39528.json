  "text": "Derrick Henry rushed for 153 yards and a touchdown in what might have been his last game for the Tennessee Titans as they quashed the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars’ hopes of a second straight AFC South title with a 28-20 win Sunday in Nashville, Tenn.\nRyan Tannehill completed 17 of 26 passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns with an interception in what was probably his last game for Tennessee (6-11). Both Henry and Tannehill become free agents in March.\nTrevor Lawrence hit 29 of 43 attempts for 280 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Jacksonville (9-8). It was a disappointing end to a highly anticipated season for the Jaguars, which lost five of their last six games to miss the playoffs.\nLawrence’s fourth-and-2 throw from the Jaguars’ 33 sailed wide of Evan Ingram with 1:47 left in the game, enabling the Houston Texans to win the division title. The result also sealed playoff spots for the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers, locking down the AFC field.\nThe Jaguars had a chance to possibly tie the game with 7:13 remaining on a fourth-and-goal play from the 1, but Lawrence’s attempt to reach the ball across the goal line on a sneak was stopped about a half-yard shy.\nBrandon McManus initiated scoring for Jacksonville at the 9:45 mark of the first quarter with a 44-yard field goal, but Tennessee answered on its first drive. Tannehill ended a 75-yard march with a 28-yard touchdown pass to Tyjae Spears with 5:57 on the clock.\nLawrence gave the Jaguars a 10-7 edge with a 59-yard scoring strike to Calvin Ridley less than three minutes into the second quarter. However, Henry regained the lead for the Titans with an 18-yard touchdown run with 8:27 left.\nSpears made it 21-10 on Tennessee’s next possession, cashing in a Lawrence interception with a 3-yard scoring run 3:03 before halftime.\nJacksonville shaved three points off the lead as the half ended with McManus’ 30-yard field goal, four plays after a dropped punt snap set up the Jaguars at the Titans’ 38.\nTannehill connected with DeAndre Hopkins on a 6-yard touchdown pass for the lone score of the third quarter. The Jaguars closed to 28-20 on Lawrence’s 14-yard scoring toss to Engram with 14:55 left in regulation.\n–Field Level Media",
