  "text": "After what was likely Derrick Henry’s last game with the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, the superstar running back thanked the home crowd and Titans fans for their support over his eight-year tenure with Tennessee. Henry’s four-year, $50 million contract ends after the 2023-24 season and with Tennessee out of the playoffs, Henry potentially played his final game for the team that selected him in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft. The four-time Pro Bowler and 2020 Offensive Player of the Year took to the mic to let Titans faithful know how appreciative he’s been of his time in Tennessee. “Titans fans, I just wanted to say thank you for the greatest eight years of my life,” Henry said. “The ups and the downs, ya’ll have been there through everything, all the adversity watching me grow as a person and a player, always supporting me.” The Alabama alum has rushed for 9,502 yards and 89 touchdowns through his NFL career, sitting at the No. 2 spot for all-time rushing yards in Titans franchise history behind Eddie George. Henry, who just turned 30 years old on Thursday, showed the league he still has gas in the tank by rushing for 153 yards and a touchdown in a 28-20 win over the Jaguars in the regular season finale on Sunday. “I love it all. I love seeing the 22s in the stadium. Hopefully I was an inspiration to all the young kids and everybody in the community,” Henry said. “Just thank you so much. God is good and Titan up, baby.” – Follow Evan Wheaton on X/Twitter @EvanWheaton ©2024 Advance Local Media LLC. Visit pennlive.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",
