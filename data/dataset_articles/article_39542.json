  "text": "The Antiochian Men (A.MEN), of St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church in Vicksburg will be hosting an appreciation dinner for first responders Tuesday from 4 until 6 p.m. at the church. The event is geared toward law enforcement, fire and emergency medical personnel. This event kicks off the new year for the group with the meal to honor those who serve the community. Father Gabriel Karam, pastor of St. George, said it is important to recognize local heroes for everything they do for the Vicksburg and Warren County community. “We wanted to honor those who serve the community by serving them with a good meal,” Karam said. “This was one way we could show our appreciation.” Rick Martin, president of the A.MEN group, said first responders from all areas of law enforcement, fire protection, medical fields and more are welcome. “We reached out and invited the Vicksburg Police Department, Vicksburg Fire Dept, Troop C, Mississippi Highway Patrol, Warren County Sheriff’s Department, Warren County Volunteer Fire departments, Vicksburg National Military Park Law Enforcement Rangers, 911 personnel, constables and the Warren County Emergency Management Agency,” Martin said. “We should have a good turnout. We asked Goldie’s Express to cater for 150 first responders. We know they all can’t sit and have a meal at the church, so there will be options to dine-in or pick up a meal-to-go and bring it back to their station.” St. George was established in 1906, and has always been involved in the community. The church mission is to spread the ancient apostolic and living Word of God in its community by putting the gospel into action and bearing witness in the world, making it accessible to all those seeking the true faith, church officials said. “Our parish is dedicated to the maintenance of a true parish environment, welcoming, loving, nurturing, and healing. Our Vision is to spread the true Word of God in our community by outreach and involvement.” St. George Antiochian Orthodox Church is located at 2709 Washington Street in Vicksburg. For further information, calls may be directed to Martin at 601-529-6062.",
