  "text": "With New Year's Eve around the corner, the group wants others to remember that choices matter.\nRandy Bonner, Executive Director for The 24/7 Movement, says they hope to prevent deaths and injuries, reminding others their choices matter.\n\"Dustin's brother just felt this overwhelming sense to want to do something to give back to the community that had been so kind and so supportive, but also wanted to do something so that this does not happen to other families and have to do this journey they've been walking,” he says.\n24 hours a day, seven days a week the organization works to keep drivers and passengers safe.\nThe Dillard's sons were two, four, and seven years old when a drunk driver changed their lives forever on Christmas day last year. Their parents, Brittany and Dustin, were killed.\nThe boys, Pryor, Pierce, and Preston fought for their lives for a month.\n“They're our heroes. They're our survivors,” says Bonner. “Two of them almost died, and they weren't expected to make it through the first night at the hospital. But by God's grace, they did.\"\nHe says the Dillard’s are visiting Disney World right now, enjoying a time they were not able to last year.\nHe says last year was incredibly painful, frustrating, and avoidable.\nThe Bradley County Sheriff's Office worked 124 DUI related crashes this year, and eight were fatal. Bonner says he knows many will be partying this New Year’s.\n“Have a plan. Do not drink and drive. Don't take a chance,” he begs. “Don't say those three words, \"I'll be fine,\" when everyone knows you're not going to be fine. Please get a ride home, find a different way.\"\nThe Safe Driving Pledge allows people to commit to making responsible choices. Their I Will Not be Silent Promise says by standing up, lives are saved.\n\"That's where somebody who knows someone that thinks they're going to be fine, they don't need a plan. Somebody can speak up and maybe prevent a tragedy from happening,” he explains.\nJoin The 24/7 Movement\nhere.",
