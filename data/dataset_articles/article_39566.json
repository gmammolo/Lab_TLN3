  "text": "Instant Analysis: LSU women's basketball takes down Ole Miss to win first SEC road game LSU's winning streak continued on the road against an SEC opponent on Sunday. The Tigers took down Ole Miss in Oxford 84-73 to win their 15th game in a row and begin conference play with a 2-0 record. The first quarter was tight with LSU leading by just three after 10 minutes. But as has been the case most of this year, it controlled the second quarter, outscoring the Rebels 24-14 to take a 50-37 lead going into the locker room. It looked like LSU was once again ready to pull away, but the third quarter was a different story. The Tigers shot just 30% as Ole Miss got back into the game, cutting the lead to 67-62 entering the fourth. Ultimately, though, LSU weathered the storm while shooting 50% in the final frame. Angel Reese nearly had a double-double with 21 points and nine rebounds, while freshman Mikaylah Williams scored 20 points. They were two of five Tigers who scored in double figures. LSU struggled to defend Ole Miss forward Marquesha Davis, who had 24 points, but it was an overall sound defensive performance. The Tigers will now have a few days off as they prepare to host [Texas A&M](http://aggieswire.usatoday.com) on Thursday night.
