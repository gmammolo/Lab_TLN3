  "text": "WEST VIRGINIA (LOOTPRESS) – The LOOTPRESS Pet of the Week is Macy, along with her pal, Cuddles! Cuddles is a 13-year-old Australian Shepherd and Macy is a 7-year-old Golden Retriever. These furry friends are adamant Mountaineer fans and always support the gold and blue on game days. They also enjoy venturing outside during half time and scoring a few touchdowns of their own! We would like to thank everyone who made submissions this week, and are excited to congratulate the team of Cuddles and Macy, the LOOTPRESS Pet of the Week in association with the Humane Society of Raleigh County ! While we certainly wish we could shine a spotlight on each and every pet for which we receive a submission, submissions and resubmissions are always welcome and encouraged, and can be made through this brief form .\nLast week’s LOOTPRESS Pet of the Week feature can be seen here . The Humane Society of Raleigh County is currently seeking volunteers as well as donations in its mission to find forever homes an array of furry friends.
