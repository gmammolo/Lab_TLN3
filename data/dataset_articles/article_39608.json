  "text": "Winner (3-0) against Dinan-Lehon (N2) this Sunday during its 32nd final of the Coupe de\nFrance, Stade de Reims escaped thanks in particular to a double from Mamadou Diakhon (18 years old). After the game, Will Still threw a dig at his young player, not necessarily aware of his abilities.\nMamadou Diakhon took advantage of the Coupe de\nFrance to score his first professional goals. Opposed to Dinan-Lehon (N2) during a 32nd final, Stade de Reims avoided the trap (3-0) thanks in particular to a double from its 18-year-old winger. After the game, Will Still praised Diakhon’s double, while throwing a little dig at him.\nWith the African Cup of Nations and the Asian Cup in January, the Reims club must find solutions. “It’s important because we don’t have much choice. They’re going to have to play, they’re going to have playing time,” Still commented when speaking of his young talents. “Diakhon, from time to time, you have to slap him behind the ear so that he wakes up and realizes the talent he has.”\n“You have to know how to translate it into Ligue 1”\nAt the start of the season, Mamadou Diakhon participated in four Ligue 1 matches, for a cumulative playing time of 52 minutes. “Today he was able to be decisive, score two interesting goals, congratulations to him. Now it’s good to do it in the Cup, we also have to know how to translate it into Ligue 1, that’s why he’s in the club,” Still said.\n“We will support him, push him to be able to do that in Ligue 1 matches,” Still continued about Diakhon. “It’s good to help young people. But we don’t have 1000 solutions either, that’s what they’re there for, we’re going to use them.”\nNext Saturday, Reims will go to Monaco for the 18th day of Ligue 1. Halfway through, the Champenois occupy eighth position in the standings. Among those absent, the Japanese Junya Ito and Keito Nakamura will notably be missing in the offensive sector. Enough to undoubtedly give Diakhon the opportunity to express himself after his double.\n2024-01-07 21:19:01\n#Reims #Stills #motivational #boost #Diakhon #author #double #Coupe #\nFrance",
