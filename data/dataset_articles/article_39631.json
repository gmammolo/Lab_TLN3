  "text": "It's one of the great stories of this Revel-PSG. In addition to this match relocated in the good atmosphere of Castres, the attacking festival of the Parisians, the masterful collective action of the fourth goal, the tasty exchange between the coaches Luis Enrique and Nicolas Giné... Maxime Zahil, number 10 of US Revel, also had his own moment of happiness.\nThe Revelois midfielder, who faced Kylian Mbappé three times during his younger years, was able to reclaim the Parisian star's jersey. \"I've talked about it before. Our paths had already crossed. At half-time, we talked about it a little bit. He gave it to me of his own accord. I thought it was a very nice and classy gesture,\" he told BeIn Sports.\n😁 The lucky winner of Mbappé's jersey. pic.twitter.com/WnjrDq1m4k\n— RMC Sport (@RMCsport) January 7, 2024\nThe vice-captain of US Revel had even warned his teammates of his experience during his previous confrontations. \"It was already going very, very fast. It was explosive. Precisely, I played on his side to defend a little more on him,\" he said in a press conference. Advice that was clearly not enough as the PSG number 7 scored a hat-trick, including a headed goal from a pigeon-wing cross from Marco Asensio.\nBut the main thing was elsewhere for the Haut-Garonne people. \"It was the game of a lifetime. The result is anecdotal. For three weeks, we went through something crazy. The most important thing is that we left a good image to all of France because that's the magic of the Coupe de France. We're savouring these last moments and, after that, it's back to reality in the league,\" regrets Maxime Zahil. The end of an enchanted interlude.",
