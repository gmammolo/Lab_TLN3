  "text": "The San Francisco 49ers will walk into the 2023 NFL Playoffs as the NFC’s No. 1 seed after a dominant run following their bye week.\nThe 49ers responded well after a three-game skid and are poised to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LVIII.\nSan Francisco has been on a roll on both sides of the field, though their defense took a noticeable hit when they lost Arik Armstead over a month ago to a foot injury.\nArmstead dealt with plantar fasciitis last season, and the issue popped up again at the end of November.\nThe defensive lineman has missed five games, including the team’s 2023 NFL season finale at home against the Los Angeles Rams.\nGeneral manager John Lynch said that they expect to have Armstead back at some point during the postseason, and that’s good news as Donte Whitner believes he’s the key to their championship hopes via NBC.\n“Arik Armstead is the key to the 49ers capturing the Lombardi,” Whitner said.\n\"Arik Armstead is the key to the 49ers capturing the Lombardi.\"\nAgree with\n[@DonteWhitner]and [@rodbrooksTV]? [pic.twitter.com/8fzvf2Z3wH]\n— 49ers on NBCS (@NBCS49ers)\n[January 7, 2024]\nWhen Armstead’s on the field, he’s a difference-maker in the run game as he’s one of the league’s best run-stoppers.\nHe’s also got some pass-rushing chops as he can generate pressure on the interior.\nIn his absence, players like Javon Hargrave, Javon Kinlaw, Kevin Givens, and Sebastian Joseph-Day have filled in admirably up front.\nFor the 49ers, the strength of the roster has always been their defense, especially in the trenches where they typically make life difficult for opposing quarterbacks.\nIt remains to be seen when or if Armstead will return, but he would certainly boost their chances of winning it all.\nNEXT: Kyle Shanahan Names The 'Best Offensive Player' He's Ever Coached",
