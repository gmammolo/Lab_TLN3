  "text": "As we start a new calendar year, I feel privileged to be able to write about a newly released recording the I actually love. That album is a first solo effort by Broadway’s Hugh Panaro, titled MAN WITHOUT A MASK.\nIt was recorded live in October of 2022, at 54 Below, and had quite a rocky ride to a rather unprecedented and unexpected release just days ago. BroadwayWorld did a terrific article that they ran with a few days ago. It’s here:\nhttps://www.broadwayworld.com/article/BWW-Exclusive-Broadways-Hugh-Panaro-Gets-an-Unexpected-Surprise-for-the-New-Year-A-True-Story-20240102\nMy wife, Eda and I certainly knew who Hugh Panaro was, but had never experienced him in a concert or club setting, as he had never done one until that run in 2022. We came away mesmerized. Truly, not being able to find words to express to others what it is that makes him so special and his career and observations so unique. Well, this album, without a doubt captures what happened in that room and, somehow, miraculously, you can hear the air crackle in the famed venue. Listening to Hugh LIVE and this particular album is very reminiscent my collection of recordings released in the ‘50s, ‘60s and ’70’s from places like The Copacabana or rooms in Las Vegas, Town Hall, The Village Vanguard, Mr. Kelly’s in Chicago or London’s Talk Of The Town to name some that immediately come to mind. This album actually crackles with life and whatever the reason, I must point out that it was mixed by Michael J. Moritz, Jr. at Continuous Jams Studios in Youngston, Ohio and mastered by Greg Reierson at Rare Form Mastering. Whatever they did, I am assuring you that they made aural magic. Then, of course, there is the “man without a mask” himself, Hugh Panaro, who possesses a voice in a category all its own, with colors and range to spare and in pristine condition, exhibiting bombast, skill, velocity, while always calibrating his intelligence communication, subtlety and nuance. So rare these days when everyone is showing off and creaming their heads off. The song selection and the story telling are seamless, but that should not have been surprising, as the music is led by Joseph Thalken, with perfect arrangements for himself at the paint and for bass player, Brian Holz, as well as the guidance, skill and and good test of Hugh’s director, Richar Jay-Alexander, who is also co-producer of the recording, along with Moritz and Panaro. The album is complete thought and journey and, disclaimer, I am also thrilled to have been asked for use of one of my photos for the cover. The packaging of the physical album (due out soon) is beautifully executed and contains additional photos by myself and Stephen Mosher and exceptional liner notes from Frank DiLella. Congratulations to everyone involved in this very special recording. You can purchase or stream wherever you find your music.\nYou can also re-visit my original review and photos of that magical night of 54 Below here:\nhttps://t2conline.com/my-view-what-took-so-long-hugh-panaro-solo-debut-at-54-below/ .\nHUGH PANARO\n“MAN WITHOUT A MASK”\nHUGH PANARO & RICHARD THALKEN\nHUGH PANARO, NELLIE BEAVERS, RICHAR-JAY ALEXANDER\n54 BELOW\nHUGH PANARO\nDONNA McKECHNIE, ERIC GABBARD, EDA SOROKOFF\nEDA SOROKOFF, HELMUT KOLLER, CATHERINE ADLER, RICHAR-JAY ALEXANDER",
